The rice is amazing and is literally the only rice I would take home from a restaurant and eat later. The house salads are great and all the meat has been very moist and flavorful. The beef is our favorite and you cannot beat the prices. Two people can eat for $30 plus a tip if your not drinking",

    "text": "I am not a big fan of lamb chops but this place definitely changed that instatly. My wife and I went to check out this restaurant  for lunch today and we'll never regret doing so. For starters, We had the stuffed grape leaves with some hummus and their bread. And for the main course, I had the meat combo platter consisting of Lamb chops, steak, pork chop, chicken and beef lula served with some awesome rice and green salad served on the same plate, garnished with grilled tomato and chili pepper and more bread. My wife had the shrimp and salmon combo plate.  We both shared each others dishes and we were really happy with every item on both plates. The food was great bursting with some awesome flavors and service was good and fast, but there's something about the servers. It seemed like they were unfriendly and impolite at times because they try not to engage in a conversation with you, tho' they will answer any question you may have about the menu when they're taking your order. I guess it's just the attitude or something....but, it's all good, because the food would make you forget any shortcomings from the servers. It's really great and we would definitely come back here and also  recommend it to our family and friends. One other thing, the menu prices here are not yet updated, and it might have a dollar or 2 difference from what is shown here.",

They also give you salad and ranch or house dressing. I highly recommend this place the only problem is it is expensive, but to us it's worth the price! I recommend using their personal delivery service rather than grub hub because they have now started making you order $100 worth of food just for delivery. I believe it's only a $45 minimum for delivery through Shish Kabob house.",

    "text": "OMG, this place is so good. I got Combo Kabob plate ($15 - come with 2 pieces of chicken  kabob, 2 pieces of beef kabob, one beef lula, and 2 pieces of lamb chop), hubby got Beef Lula & Chicken Kabob ($11 - come with one beef lula and 4 chicken kabob).  The inside of the plates are about 8\"x8\".  Half plates cover with salad, one grilled tomatoes and one grilled jalapeno.  Half plate cover with buttery rice and topped with your order of meat.  It also comes with pita bread which I was too full to try.  Alot of food for reasonable price.  That's the best lamp chops, juicy, tender, and not gammy.  All meats are cooked perfectly, juicy and taste great.  If I have to put them in order, from the best: lamp chop, beef kabob, chicken kabob, beef lula. Soda is $1.95, refillable.  I have a $10 coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> purchased back in Feb 2016.  Total bill including tax was $29.xx. I used the $10 discount to bring it down to less than $20, plus tips, paid $25 out the door.   It's a great meal.  Too bad I cannot find another coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>    The 5 star rating was for the price and food, not for the services.  If I rate both together, it will be 4 star.  Services can be better... we got there at 7:35pm on Tuesday(5/17), and it took a while to get seated.  We were given the menu, but no one came back to take our orders.  One nice waitress finally asked us has anyone had helped us.  She then sent another waitress to take our order.  Our waitress has a poker face.  My husband said he wants some diet coke when the food comes, the waitress took it as no need to give him water... at least, you should ask.  We were finally able to place our orders 5 mins before 8pm.  We got our food around 8:20pm.  If you are in a hurry, don't come here.  It's not in and out fast food restaurant.",

We want to pick it up and it was all wrong, even the ticket had the correct order.  They offered us nothing.  They said you can wait 15 minutes for new food, well that's why I ordered it ahead of time so I don't have to wait.

But you walk in and the owners are great and the food delicious.   The prices are ridiculous as well, with most meals around $10 for portions large enough for 2 meals. The Shish kabob meal is your best bet. The hummus was probably average, and I was disappointed no tzatziki sauce was offered without a request, but still a worthwhile meal  I don't know about authentic, but the food was super tasty and filling. Probably the best Mediterranean, Lebanese, etc. cuisine that I've been to so far.",

    "text": "I wanted to go to a casual Mediterranean eatery so I was a little set back when I saw how nicely it was decorated. I didn't want to pay top dollar for food that I know I could get at Yassou's for a decent price. My worries were put to rest when I saw the menu  because it looked really casual. It looked like a fast food menu with prices to match!  I ordered a mix of beef and chicken with rice. When I first saw the rice wasn't yellow I wasn't sure what to think. (I was brought up on yellow Mediterranean rice with plenty of turmeric) The rice was delicious and the meat was tender. I thought. I would like the beef better but they were both equally yummy! The salad that came with the meal was fresh and crisp.   The Shish Kabob House is a great place to sit down to great meal and it is affordable too!",

(Meat, cheese, and potato) the meat was my favorite. The ambience kind of reminded me of a banquet hall. There is a stage when you first enter. Overall, great experience will go back!",

The falafel was tasty but over fried and dark. The pita bread is not good, basic Restaurant Depot Stuff. The eggplant caviar was very good and the chicken kabob was very good as well.  The prices are good and the service seems ok, we had take out. The salad they give you with your order was ok but lacked flavor and the rice was good. Would I go back? Possibly but I would really like to know if the Lula was fried. I have had much better and much worse. 6 out of 10. I would go back but not crave as of yet. I hope they work on some of these concerns.",

I ordered the combo kabob plate, which usually comes with beef and chicken kabobs along with 1/2 plate of salad, 1/2 plate of rice, a grilled pepper and tomato, and more pita. I asked for double salad instead of the rice. The beef was very well seasoned and while the chicken was also good, I liked how moist the steak was in comparison. The salad was also fresh but if I had to nitpick, I wish they would have given me the dressing on the side (the salad was kind of heavy).   Despite nearly being led to the kitchen to get to work, I'd love to come back again. I only paid ~$13 for a plate of fresh food with large portions and I thought it was a great value.",

The servers were really courteous and my cup if water never emptied out. I couldn't drink half the cup of water without having someone refill it. I love that kind of service and great service goes a long way with me. The shrimp and salmon was great and their vegetables soup was a perfect appetizer.

I went with my family, and I received a warm welcome once I heard the sound of the music. It was a very relaxing, warm environment, prices are reasonable, and of course the food is AMAZING!  I would like to describe the music. The guy, whose name is Haik, played and sang music very professionally. A thing I liked about him was that he sang in many different languages, as the restaurant itself is very diverse. I noticed that other people as well as myself enjoyed listening to the melody of the music as well as his voice.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone! This really made my vacation a memorable one! I will absolutely come here next time I visit Vegas!! :)",

It wasn't my turn to pick but I wasn't worried since I have always enjoyed whatever we ended up having. At first when I was told the name I figured it was something like Texas De Brazil where endless meats would be brought to the table. It just kinda sounded like that type of place to me. I told my wife later that night where I was having lunch the next day and she busted up laughing asking what the heck I was going to eat? She then let me know it was one of those \"cucumber places\" that I don't like. See I don't like Mediterranean type food because even when I ask for no cucumbers, I seem to still get cucumbers on something when I have eaten at places like that in the past. I ended up pleasantly surprised here at Shish Kabob House. I ordered a beef lula and beef kabob meal that came with fries and salad. I liked the beef kabo a lot it has a nice flavor and wasn't tough at all. The lula was new to me and I thought it was just alright but nothing I'd order again. I didn't touch the salad because I want to make sure and keep my manly figure but the fries tasted delicious! I wouldn't come back on my own however if someone wanted to meet up here again I would be cool with it. Our server was nice and prompt at bringing everything.",

There was one cute little old couple that was patiently waiting until the dance floor was open, and then they got up and danced all night.  It was the type of scene that reminds you what you love most about your loved one.  It was very sweet.  The service is very attentive.  The babaganoosh and hummus tasted pretty much straight out of a can with minimal seasoning.  The prices are very reasonable.  I will definitely come again when I want to appreciate talented live entertainment.  It looks this place is awesome for families and groups.",

    "text": "We arrived at a good time for Saturday night.  Upon walking in we were seated right away.  First thing my ears noticed was live music.  First thing my eyes notices was there were a few tables setup more elegantly for private reservations.    The wall decor in this restaurant is modern and looks more like a lobby than a dining theme.  But it's a pretty interior.  This is white table cloth dining which usually means more formal.  We weren't rejected for being casual.    Their menu is a multi-page laminated binder type book, with appetizing photos and prices.  Pricing is decent and comparable to most Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurants I've dined.  But here the ambience is nicer.    I tried their yogurt soup.  I liked it alot.  It wasn't recommended, which was odd coming from our waiter.  I understand yogurt generally is a cold food - not hot.  It reminded me of a sour tamarind soup Filipinos cook with gata (coconut milk). So I enjoyed the yogurt soup.  Service is mediocre. Thus minus a point from being almost 5 star.  The food took a little long, but super delicious.  We ordered family style for five, which is the smarter way to go if you have at least 4+ people.  Our check took even longer.  Unusual as they didn't offer dessert.  Good thing we were full.  They were all nice though.  On a really good note for them, they were practically full house by the time we left.  Definitely a popular eating spot.  I'd only return to dine here if I were with another large group.",

    "text": "How have I never heard about this place until last night? My usual go-to for Mediterranean food was Mad Greek and since they closed down, I have tried a few places in the hopes that I would find one to fill the gaping hole that Mad Greek left (lol)   My boyfriend has gone here before with his parents but failed to mention just how good it is here. Last night he said we should eat dinner here so thankfully it's about a 5 minute drive from my house, I believe this location is in a complex on Flamingo/Rainbow beside a hookah/vape shop.   There's a wide parking lot in front of the restaurant so don't worry about finding a spot. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there was live music to my right. An older man with a piano was playing and singing in another language. At first glance this place looks like it could be or was also a ballroom. It's a wide open space with no counters or cash registers or anything that would indicate this is a restaraunt.  Tons of tables, tons of people. Compared to the almost always empty Mad Greek (and I loved Mad Greek) I had high hopes that this was going to really raise the bar for me. I brought in my service dog and was very pleased when there were no questions asked, aside from the expected staring from other patrons.  Well lit, simple decorations on the wall, music as we eat... Nice! I searched through their menu and to be honest, I was so hungry I really didn't focus too much on anything other than the words \"SALMON SHISH KABOB\" because, SALMON?! I love Salmon and I've never been to a Mediterranean restaurant that served Salmon, so obviously guess what I ordered? My boyfriend ordered the chicken Shish kabob. Our order took awhile to arrive, assuming that the chicken and salmon take longer, and the only reason I noticed it was taking longer was because people who had arrived after us had received their food first.  I didn't mind, because as soon as my glorious plate was placed in front of me, I couldn't think of anything else. It's a really large plate of food for the price. Same for my boyfriend's plate. The salmon and the rice almost melt like butter in your mouth, I couldn't stop eating! The salad was delicious although I could care less about the pepper and the roasted tomato.  Naturally I couldn't finish my food, although I would if I could! We were given to-go containers to pack the rest, but I will definitely be coming back and bringing some friends along with me! I have finally found my go to spot; you guys will be seeing me quite often ;D",

The restaurant filled up quickly. My husband mentioned how other tables that came in after us were getting their food before us. I held my tongue and waited patiently because our waiter came by and said how busy the cooks were preparing for a catering event for 200. No problem until thirty minutes passed and more & more table that came in after us were getting their dinner. At this point, I was a bit frustrated. I asked another server about a large table getting their food before us. She responded with, \"they ordered before they got here.\" (They literally got there 20 minutes into us sitting there. We should have already had our food.) I pointed to 4 other tables that had received their food and arrived after us. I feel I need to note we didn't have anything complicated. It was a very basic order of two plates, with no alterations. She didn't respond to me, went and talked to our server, & 3 minutes later we had our food. Hmmmm!!! I must say the dinner was good but after that experience, it didn't taste as good as it should. I just wanted to get out of there. They never apologized or anything. I'm glad they are so busy to not care about their customers.",

    "text": "Wow, where do I even start? This was a horrible experience- with both the food and the business owner. My office ordered from here through grubhub which the owners were skeptical about but I assured them I used grubhub all the time and I've never had a bad experience.We ordered over $63 worth of food and waited... and then waited more. After the over one hour mark I called the restaurant (I use this term lightly here) to see what was going on and I was told by the person answering the phone that they were waiting on the grubhub driver and they had at least another 15 mins to grab the food.. Okay, I completely understand but I was concerned about the food because they told me it was already made so I expressed concern if it was going to be hot or not and that our fries now would be soggy. I was put on a brief hold and another person picked up the call and assured me the food would be fine and not to worry.    Another thirty minutes later the food finally arrived. And wow, we were NOT happy. The chicken kabobs were cold, not hot. The order of chicken fingers we ordered were BURNT, the salads were SOGGY, the fries were SOGGY and the thing that really tipped me off to their poor standards was that the sides of tzatziki sauce were room temperature.    Knowing exactly when the grub hub driver is going to pick up the food, you would think the restaurant would make your food to order and NOT have it sitting around for who knows how long (at least 30 minutes by my first phone call) and just compromise an entire order. I couldn't even eat my gyro because who knows how sick I would get from eating room temperature yogurt sauce that had been just sitting around. YUK.     I called the restaurant and the phone was answered by an employee. I told them what happened and was put on a 5 minute hold so they could talk to this places \"owner\". They came back on the line and told me they could give me 20% off my next order. I'm sorry, that's NOT good enough. EVERYTHING in the order was messed up in some way. I'd be trying to convince my bosses to order from here again after THIS kind of experience and that's the option I get? I told the employee this so I was placed on ANOTHER 5 minute hold so they can go talk to this \"owner\". When they finally came back they said well it's only the 20% off and they can send me another chicken finger meal. I told them no, and if I could speak to the owner. After a LOT of hesitation they finally put me on hold and got the owner for me. The owner told me that that's all they were offering and I explained that a 20% discount for \"next time\" would go unused because we wouldn't use it. If they could offer perhaps a comp meal or two for next time I could see us ordering from there again so we could give them another try. He didn't want to hear ANY of this and HUNG UP on me!! Wow, with this kind of service they'll be out of business in no time. Zero consideration for new (and possibly returning) customers and just downright rude.     I then called grubhub and told them about my experience. The customer service rep who answered was very apologetic and commented of how I always order through grubhub and I've never had an experience like this. She put me on a brief hold and called the \"restaurant\". She returned and said they were going to do nothing for this complete mess up (on their end) and she even tried to compromise with them for half of a refund and other ideas to help the situation. The \"owner\" would have non of it. The rep apologized to me again and there's nothing they could do.    Horrible experience with a \"restaurant\" and \"owner\". Poor execution of food prep, leaving food out to get to dangerous temperature levels that could make people sick, serving burnt food (Is there ANYONE checking quality control??). Stay away and save your money!!!",

It is understandable that the 3 servers at that time tend to get very busy so you'll have to grab their attention to get to your additional request.  Highly recommendable.",

The food, the service, and the value were phenomenal!   We ordered the spinach dip and 3 entrees (pork kebob, chicken kebab and beef kebab, chicken kebab and beef lulu).    The spinach dip was amazing!  The dip is prepared with labneh (a type of greek yogurt), spinach, garlic, and salt.  We had this as an appetizer with pita bread.  The dip was rich and creamy and honestly so good I wanted to eat it by the spoonful!  The entrees were also super delicious and large in portion.  While all of the meat was nicely seasoned and tender, our favorite was the beef kebab.  It was seasoned to perfection and prepared medium.  The entrees also came with a green salad with an amazing lemon, olive oil dressing, a side of rice and fries, a roasted tomato and a roasted jalapeno.  Great quality food, generous portions, excellent service, reasonable prices-we can't ask for more! (except for opening a restaurant in the LA area)  We will definitely recommend the Shish Kebab house to others and look forward to return visits!",

She brought out my food 20 minutes before my dinner company so I had to let it sit and get cold while I waited for them to get their food. Next she brought out 2 plates. Again more waiting now for 3 of us. Finally she brought out the remaining food including the egg rolls that went with my order. The last plate brought out had really hard over cooked chicken on it. I guess it was forgotten about in the fryer or something. Waiting for our food some of us finished off our drinks. She did not offer a refill. She then got annoyed when on of my companions asked for a basket of some type of bread. She brought this out without any oil or butter. My companion gave up and flagged down another waiter to ask for the toppings. The food was subpar after all the effort to get it. Not worth it at all. Not to mention that the table we were seated at wobbled badly and the chair seats appeared to be very stained and dirty. This was quite honestly the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I will never step foot in this place again. Oh and after they cleared our plates they never brought us the check to pay. We had to get up and wait upfront for someone to stop and help us. She then handed me the slip to sign and ran off again making me wait further to hand over the signed slip with my card info on it. I did not want to leave that lying around.",

The meats are juicy and flavorful, appetizers are abundant and delicious! Too bad it's too far from California. It's a must for every time I'm in Vegas, though. Middle Eastern food is usually not cheap, but their prices are quite reasonable. GO THERE. You won't regret it!",

This place has some of the best Mediterranean food we've had in Vegas, and is also incredibly affordable and they give you huge portions! We always get take-out, but the restaurant is really nice inside.  We always get the Chicken and Beef Lula kabob plates with rice. The plates come choice of rice or fries and all come with a side salad, pitas, and a roasted tomato and jalapeno. The kabob is always juicy and flavorful. I also always get a side of hummus, which once again, they give you a huge amount (2x what you get in a Sabra container and half the price and tastes better too!).   If your too full for dessert after dinner, be sure to stop in the Manaan bakery right next door and bring something home for later! I highly recommend the macaroons!",

I had to wave and yell at waiters at nearby tables to get their attention. Service was somehow slow too. And do not let me get started on the type of flooring they had, it made a v loud echo by the conversation of diners there, we could not have a decent conversation among ourselves.

Why don't these employees smoke in the back of the restaurant? Blatantly not  giving a sh*t.  Once you walked in, you see a sign that says \"Please wait here to be seated\". I stood there and right in front of me I see the Men's bathroom door and a folding table filled with napkins, silverware, and menus. Its pretty rare to see a server station look like that all out in the open.  The place was half full at 2pm. Servers were walking around but no host to welcome new customers. I stood there for about 5 minutes without getting greeted by anyone. The food isn't worth the terrible service. Never coming back.",

Its plentiful plus you get to try different things. The Baltika beers pair great with stuffed grape leaves at least in my opinion or also with the smoked salmon. On weekends they Sometimed  have private parties  and it effects the ambiance so maybe try going for lunch or maybe on a weekday. By far my favorite kabob place in town, try the borsch soup... yum yum !",

Kraffi was very helpful on the phone and their delivery takes time, so plan accordingly Must trys:- Toubouleh, Armenian Salad Dolmas Salmon Kabobs Beef Lula Kabobs(friends recommendations) Great job Shish Kabob House..you guys rock",

To drink we got water, and the cups were actually dirty a bit disgusting so I got the server to bring us water in other cups. They definitely need to make sure to thoroughly clean the cups. But this doesn't deter me from giving the place 5 stars because service was great and food was delicious.   First thing we got was the hummus. Absolutely great hummus, you can definitely tell it's homemade. They serve you a lot too! I took some home to eat with pita chips!   Next came our entrees. The first thing I took a bite of is the beef kabob. Delicious and cooked to the point!! The chicken kabob was equally great. The jasmine rice is also to die for!   Definitely coming back to this place! Servings are huge too! You could probably share a dish with two.",

    "text": "How awesome is it to finally discover Shish Kabob House and the Manan Bakery next door. I've been passing by this plaza for years without giving it a second glance. Recently came to Shish Kabob House and was pleasantly surprised.   The restaurant is larger than I expected and the ambiance is quite pleasant. I guess I had expected a more fast food set up than an actual dimly lit restaurant setting. Pleasant surprise there, good job Shish Kabob. There is a stage right at the entrance and some chairs around the waiting area. Personally, I would recommend a set up for a host stand so people are not walking in confused if this is the entrance. Also, might help them keep things more organized. But anyway, there is live music on a Saturday night. I walked in to a keyboard playing and I loved it. It is not distracting but just very pleasant and calming. Come back again, keyboard man, you are pretty darn cool.  The portion size is fantastic. As a huge fan of Mediterranean food, this did not disappoint. Shared the lamb kabob plate and the kabob combo platter. Both come with pita, salad, and a choice of rice or fries. You can opt to have half and half, which is what we ordered. Also comes with a grilled tomato and grilled green pepper. The salad is pretty delicious and the meat is both tasty and tender. The portion size is fantastic. The lamb kabob is delicious and tender but the kabob combo platter won me over. You get 2 lamb chops, beef, chicken and lula all in one.   The service here is great, despite being very busy. I do think they are a bit short staffed as I see the servers moving around a lot. Working hard! They are very patient and friendly.  Would I recommend this place? You bet! Would I come back again? Very soon.",

I stopped by to order some food to-go and was pleasantly surprised with a very nicely decorated restaurant. I was greeted once I walked in and ordered a beef lula and beef kabob combination plates with rice/salad and a hummus appetizer. They have a wide variety of other combination plates that you can order at very reasonable prices. The hummus appetizer was a good size for the price as well and I would like to go back and try the eggplant caviar and some of the other meat combinations.  While I was waiting for my food, they did have a performer as well that was playing the keyboard and singing. Will definitely go back again to get food to go and will probably end up eating in sometime too.",

I eat there once a week and It is not the way to treat your regulars !!!!!! We were starving and this is the reason we did not leave !!! Now I am sorry I stayed... It was a mad house. People waiting 30-45 min TO PAY for their orders and others waiting by the door to get a table! VERY INCOMPETENT STAFF !!! If you're hungry at the peak hours, STAY AWAY from this place. You will grow old waiting for your food and when it comes, it's cold....",

It also came with pita and salad. My girlfriend ordered the lamb gyro and she loved it as well. They are very generous with the meat. The only reason why I would rate it a 4/5 is because the server was kinda awkward. Almost as if we were a burden to him. He also messed up my girlfriends order by giving her rice instead of fries. We made it clear while ordering she wanted fries. It wasn't a big deal we asked for him to get fries and it was done. The real issue was that he tried to tell me they voided the order of fries on the receipt, but it still showed up on the total. They corrected it, but why tell me that it wasn't charged when clearly it showed up as a charge. Overall it was a decent experience and I would come here again.",

It also happens to be right next door to the best bakery in town! I I ordered a few things as I often do when trying a new place just so I have another option if something is terrible. And let me tell you, there wasn't anything terrible about this place. They were fast, friendly and the food is AMAZING! The musician was so inviting and sweet and had such a great voice, it made me wish I hadn't ordered to go.  I ordered the lamb chops, Greek salad with chicken and hummus, all for about $30. The lamb chops are by far my favorite and so under priced! They're seasoned to perfection and the meat is cooked perfectly. The salad was good and the chicken was moist. The only thing I do wish the did was make their own pita bread or order from a different company.  I will definitely be returning!",

Thank you, Julia, because I love the rice, but the wide fries were seasoned perfectly. Our waitress Julia was wonderful, and she even joked with us a bit. Loved the experience.

    "text": "I've been pondering over checking out this place for sometime now, as many in the community have raved about it. My experience is strictly based on a carry out order. I would honestly give their meats (pork chops, beef kebob, beef lule and chicken) about 2 stars - and both stars would be for the beef kebob only. The rest were dry and tasteless. Order was served with an half opened package of pita bread - GROSS and no onions. A package is pita is $1, really? Clearly the place is pinching pennies and the staff mostly Serbian is unaware of how the kebabs should be served.  Experience/Lack of customer service:  I wanted to order half of their meat catering platter when the waiter taking my order informed that I couldn't order half of their catering platter. I thought, okay fair enough. I didn't want the rice but wanted to try different meats. He then said I could just order the meat. My bill was about $60 and while I was waiting, I glanced at the menu and realized I could have ordered different plates with meat, rice (I would have thrown away), grilled tomatoes and peppers. I asked another server if the meat will be served with tomatoes, peppers, bread and onions with parsley and she said yes. When they finally brought my food after at least a 30 min wait, she informed me that the tomatoes and peppers were not included. I explained the rationale that if I were to order individual plates, I would have gotten the veggies. The young girl shrugged her shoulders and asked me who took my order and agreed that I should have placed individual orders. Asked an older lady and sternly said \"no\" to veggies with meat.   As I mentioned above, the food was nothing special at all, but the mere nonchalant attitude made it feel as if I was a customer in Eastern Europe. I will never return and would not recommend a place who isn't remotely interested in attracting a customer with polite service. Last note, a good indication of an ethnic food restaurant's quality their customer base. If don't see anyone from that ethnicity, chances are it's not that good.",

I've always ordered to go since my first visit.   Recently, though, I had to take a break from this place as every time I ordered from them within the past year, I was getting chicken kabob with a really weird rubbery texture. It honestly was like they froze it, defrosted, froze it, and then defrosted again.   Tonight I was really craving their rice and the way their food used to taste so I gave it another try hoping that this time it would be much better.   I didn't eat the kabob at all because I was so disgusted by what they served me as the chicken lula.  It was hard on the outside, like it had been sitting out all day.  The outside was wrinkled and dry.   I am never ordering from here again. Can't believe they would serve customers this food and think it's ok.   Check out the pictures. This is what they served me saying it's chicken lula. It may have been at one point, but it's definitely not chicken lula as their images on their menu show.  Gross.",

We finally ordered 3 hummus & pita, 2 Greek salads, and two Kabob Platters (beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken lula kabob, beef lula kabob, rice , French fries.) They ran out of pork kabob.   We finally got our water, hummus and pitas, and the Greek Salads, but we couldn't eat our salad because we didn't have any plates or utensils. We had to wait another 10 minutes to get our plates and utensils.  The food is pretty good, but I don't recommend going to this restaurant if you value good customer service.

Next, this obnoxious lady comes and yells across the semi elegant restaurant... \"Have you been helped?\" I said yes. She started to have a discussion with the nice lady. I guess there was a confusion about the order and the name. She proceeded to give me the wrong order. Then the nice lady tried to stop her and would not listen. She apologized and told me that sorry that it's not my order. Then I hear her from the back yelling at the other workers about he miscommunication. As a customer this is  uncomfortable. Poor guy she was yelling to. It's not a big deal, just have a proper and professional discussion about communication being key. Do not involve your clients and have them listen to frustrated employees yelling at each other in the back. Anyway, this really bothered me because I first had a really good impression with the restaurant and it went down hill when this lady came up and killed the mood.  The nice lady was awesome.... Very professional and caring. She even said... Have a nice dinner sir.  If it wasn't for her, I would of given a 1 star. The food was great!",

That said - this place is a definite thumbs up.  It's quite obviously a family run restaurant, apparently Armenian, and extremely good.  The food was great - I wish I knew where they buy their lamb, some of the best I've ever had - event the rice was not clingy/starchy - but fluffy and good.  We also had the cheese platter and the Armenian salad - we're not Armenian, but if this is how they eat, maybe we can convert.  We ordered it for delivery - it arrived on time (well, maybe a little late) - delivered by a very polite young man - and there was a charge for delivery, but the owner assured us that the driver got the whole charge, and there was no need to tip (wish I had though).  It was not exactly hot, but it was warm enough to enjoy - and there was a little too much of it.  They gave us an entire bag of delicious pita bread along with over-sized orders of delicious food.  I suspect the dill and mint and onions included with the cheese platter are from someone's garden because you could actually taste them - and the grilled tomato and pepper with the kabobs was clearly from the same place.  One of the problems with Las Vegas is the over-abundance of large chain restaurants (come on, we don't need anymore BJ's Breweries, Mimi's Cafes, Claim Jumpers or (especially) Olive Gardens - and the strip joints are way overpriced and crappier than they claim to be - this kind of family owned, personal service place is precisely what we need more of.  And the price is VERY reasonable for what you get.  I told the owner when I called that she should make it good so that we would eat with them again - and I have to say she kept her end of the bargain.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND - and we'll be visiting the restaurant as soon as we can to have the experience in person.  By the way - brief message to the owner - not sure who the young man who delivered our order was - but give him a raise.",

    "text": "I tasted a few Mediterranean foods and I have to say, this was the best restaurant to serve it!  I have to be honest, I was skeptical. I've had my fair share of mediterranean foods and I have to say, they weren't all that good. And I love food.  But I was very hungry especially when I haven't had my breakfast and it was close to 1 PM (plus with only 2 hours of sleep) I was willing to eat and try anything.  They interior decor was really nice. It certainly didn't felt like Las Vegas, but it didn't felt I was home either. We sat out on the patio, between the hookah lounge and the restaurant. It wasn't hot for some reason (we expected it to be).  Our waitress was a lady thats been working there for 12 years. (insane!) First thing I wanted, w-a-t-e-r!  (I chug down 2 large glasses of water before my order came out!)  I couldn't make sense what the menu entrees and I complained a little bit about it. My friend took it serious and told me to get the kabob with a choice of different type of meats. I chose lamb (because I haven't had lamb in years). After 2 glasses of water, our food finally came out. I have to say, they weren't the most presentable foods I've seen. They look like one long turd with a side of pilaf rice. After my first bite though I have to say, I don't recall looking up to my fellow travelers and talk with them until I finished my dish... the whole thing.  Very full filling, food coma status.  I do recommend this spot. Go there before you hit the casinos and hotel, it's a spot you must try!",

    "text": "We placed an order for delivery from the Shish Kabob House on Friday night, February, 9th.  When the order was delivered, we were excited to dig in.  The first thing we noticed was that the bread was hard as a rock.  The delivery guy told us to cook it on the grill for about 15-20 seconds to soften it.  After he left, we noticed that the tag on the bag showed an expiration date of Saturday, Feb 3rd!  I could see maybe sending over bread that was a day old, but an entire week!??  Every item we ordered, (kabob meet, salads and multiple dips) came with bread for optimal enjoyment.  We all lost our appetite when we began to question the use of expired meat and produce.  If they felt comfortable sending bread that was a week old, AND including the tag that shows the expiration date, they obviously weren't concerned about health and safety of their customers.  When we reached out to the store manager, we were told he was too busy to take our call.  We were promised a return phone call, but that call was never made.  $150 down the drain!",

My wife and I have ordered here religiously, (because we love the food) but the experience has been less than favorable. Delivery takes over an hour, which would be fine if the order was delivered as ordered. It seems every other order has been incorrect or cold.   The last order we placed came 72 minutes after being placed, was cold and they had forgotten our beverages. I called to inquire and check on the possibility of the beverages being delivered, and the response I had gotten was that they wouldn't be delivered. My money would not be refunded. They offered to give me free beverages on my next delivery, but I'll never order again. There have been too many mistakes and inconsistencies with delivery, so I'd only recommend this location for a dine in experience.",

I thought it was a charming little place. It has that family owned feeling to it. There was an older gentleman at the front playing the keyboard and singing Frank Sinatra.   The food was tasty, and the portions I got were generous. I think it was about $13 for a couple of kabobs, pita, hummus,  salad,  and rice. I had the lamb and !!! So flavorful and tender.  Paired with a couple of beers, it was am enjoyable meal. The staff was very attentive.  For dessert I had the red velvet cake and Armenian coffee. The cake was a tad dry, but the coffee was nice and strong!   I'll be back for more lamb!",

They had a wedding or some special event going on so they closed a part of the restaurant down so we were on the left side of the restaurant. They have a wide selection of items on their menu. Everything looked good and prices were affordable. My friend Shannon went here before and she had the big platter that fed 8-9 people but since it was just us two tonight we just shared an appetizer and ordered our own dish. She got this green salad with tomatoes for our appetizer I forgot what it was called but it was delicious. It was refreshing and we ate it with pita bread. She ordered the steak and chicken combo and I ordered the lamb chops. I was very happy with my lamb chops. They were juicy and tender. I also liked the rice that was under the lamb. It was flavorful and was moist rice. The salad that came with my lamb chops was very refreshing and great salad dressing as well. I love my dish. I'm really not a big Mediterranean eater but this place was delicious. Us girls each got a glass of wine. I got the white Zinfandel and Shannon got the Chardonnay. I wish they had Moscato wine here but the white Zinfandel worked. I like sweet wine although I was eating red meat and suppose to drink red wine I love me white wine. Definitely recommend this place. There's a bakery right next to the restaurant so I have to come back and get dinner and go next door for bakery goods.",

Ok, it really wasn't THAT long of a wait, maybe 5 minutes or so, but...the restaurant wasn't busy, and there was a server just standing up at the front of the restaurant doing nothing.    Our server finally came over and gave us menus, and took our water order.    We asked the server for a recommendation on the appetizer, and she recommended the smoked salmon.  (After a brief misunderstanding about which two we were deciding on).    When the salmon came out...it was glistening.  They had absolutely DRENCHED it in olive oil!  Why?  Smoked salmon doesn't need anything on it, its delicious on its own...my bf  and I tried one small piece each, and sent it back.  They sent another one that had far less oil, and tasted much better.  The hummus was ok. I've had better store bought hummus, but I've also had WAY worse.  There was a lot of oil pooling on the outside of the hummus dish here as well, but that doesn't really bother me too much...I've seen and had worse.  I'd have liked to have had just a hint more garlic in this batch of hummus, but it was good enough that my fella ate it, and he's not the biggest fan of hummus.  I ordered the grape leaves, which were very good.   Although...I asked if they were vegetarian (not that I care, I was just curious, because I've had them both ways) and the server's response was:  \"Oh, yes, vegetarian.  You know, just rice and meat.\"  Um...what?  Is there meat or isn't there?    The redeeming quality, and what is keeping this a 3 star review instead of 2 stars, is the kababs.   The beef and the chicken kebabs were both tender, juicy, and very flavorful.   The rice it was served on was overcooked slightly, and the salad that they served with it (once again) had a touch too much oil, but the flavor of the meat was wonderful.  I'd like to try this place again, perhaps it was an off day?  They deliver, and are right around the corner from where I live, so I will definitely go back, or order in.",

Tonight I brought my mom.   Ok so here is the thing service is hit and miss here. Generally I've had excellent service except the one time I brought a friend here and the service wasn't horrible but it wasn't good.   The ambiance is classy casual if that makes sense. Its nice enough to bring a date here but you don't have to dress up. There are families here and a lot of the time they have receptions here. So you might want to call before coming out.  I haven't had anything that I didn't drool over. My favorites are the hummus with beef. Sooo yummy. Beef kabob and beef Lula plate with rice. OMG this is heaven. The beef kabob is beef medallions cooked perfectly. Beef Lula is seasoned ground beef sooo good. The rice so buttery and a green salad with red wine vinegar olive oil dressing.",

Give them all my name.  Ask for a side order of yogurt sauce that they gave me while I dined there last time.  Guys says I have to do an entire appetizer order! Wtf? Ridiculous! I pay and go! I get home and our salad and fries are so soggy and our rice and hummus is ice cold! The pita bread is cold and hard! The meat was dry and overcooked!  Darn it! I knew I shouldn't have come back to this place! What a waste of money!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!",

I probably eat here at least 6 times a year.  I only get takeout and have never dined here.      It is downright AMAZING that not only have they stayed in business this long but thrived.  When so many restaurants have come and gone since they opened, SKH has been consistently great for 5+ years and there really aren't any other businesses nearby that contribute to their success.  People come to this rinky dink plaza for their delicious food.  That's it.  I love their huge combo platter that's around $15.  You get salad, rice or fries, and just a mountain of meats.  Even though Armenia and Brazil are miles away from each other, I deem this platter (explosion!) THE POOR MAN'S FOGO DE CHAO ow ow ow ow!  You get lamb, steak, chicken and lula all in one box.  Sure it's not AYCE but congratulations to you if you can finish this whole thing in one sitting.  My wife and I split this.  It's also $30 cheaper than Fogo so double boom.  ****Review #100 for 2013!!!",

    "text": "Walking up to the restaurant it was hard for me to figure out how to get inside. The first door I tried was locked and so was the second door I tried. I guess it was third time's a charm. I almost gave up thinking they were closed for a private party, but I persevered.  The restaurant is much larger than I was expecting. Very nice as well. They have a little stage near the entrance that, so I look forward to checking this place out on the weekends. Their menu is very well-priced. I was impressed with how inexpensive everything is. I ordered a gyro plate and combination kabob platter to-go. The wait was a little long and as I sat there I noticed a few patrons having to flag down the waitress to order, ask for menus, refills and drinks. The servers were all really nice and kept checking on me while I waited.   After about 30-40 minutes, my food was ready, I paid my check and was on my way. When I arrived home, I was surprised to find the huge portions of the food. For about $23 and change I ended up with food enough for three people. The gyro was just ok, but our favorite was the kabob platter. It comes with your choice of 2 pork or lamb chops, some chicken and beef kabobs. It also comes with steak fries, a large side salad and some rice. So much food and so affordable. The meat was great, perfectly cooked, moist and very flavorful.   I can't believe I have been passing this place for so many years without giving them a try. I will be back... and often.",

    "text": "The best place for Middle Eastern food in town, and the best part are the generous portions of food so you can eat and share. The menu consists of a mix of traditional Lebanese and Armenian dishes and it is as authentic as they can be. Nice atmosphere with live piano music. My favorite place to treat my friends or first-timers to middle eastern cuisine. Do not expect a full Lebanese selection as they mostly have BBQ selections but the taste is excellent and quality of food which screams freshness, especially the Beef Kabob which is great. The best part is that they deliver and we order at least once a week to my place of work at Crystals, and even got many of my peers to get hooked on the place, especially with their free delivery!  Before starting though, I recommend the famous Lebanese salad, Tabouli and the Hummus (not the best I had, but decent), the Babaganush (mashed eggplant paste) or the Grape Leaves (Dolmas as they also call it), among others... Just be careful not to indulge too much because the main dishes are huge and generous. If you are not sure what to get, man of the plates are combos with many combinations of chicken and beef to chose from... Their desserts are the only thing that is disappointing is the lack of middle-eastern selection of pastries which the region is famous for, but after you finish your main entree, I doubt you will have room for any anyway. The place is good for groups or private parties, as we always run into one from time to time; but no worry, they have an extra room they open up to still accommodate others. I guarantee that you will keep going back for more, and your first-timer friends will love you for it...",

Would have been a somewhat reasonable price if there was any flavor. Absolutely no love went into this creation. Not authentic what so ever.   Rice: Regular white rice, slightly fried making it oily. No seasoning on it at all Chicken & Lamb Kabob: No flavor and REALLY dry. I ended up feeding it to the dog. Salmon & Shrimp: Roommate said the salmon was over cooked, no flavor on it whatsoever.  Chicken Tabaka: Regular roasted chicken lacking  flavor and moister.   This place could be AMAZING! The Mediterranean has a plethora of spices. Why aren't they being used here?   SILVER LINING and why i gave this place 2 stars apposed to 1: The Lady answering the phones was extremely nice.",

She is the best waitress there and will make sure your food is well prepared and warm when you get it. She is always good about refilling drinks and always knows what to recommend when you don't know what to get. As far as the food goes portions are a good size and cheap. I have tried the chicken and beef kabob as well as the pork chops all of them very tasty and delicious. I don't usually eat pork because I don't like the flavor, but their pork was the best ever cooked to perfection. My favorite part of the dish would have to be the rice and the salad mmmm... scrumcious!!! Oh and the roasted tomato is the best. Food has always been fresh and great tasting. Another plus is there is always entertainment, whether its the TV or live I love their music. If you are a coffee lover you should try the Armenian Coffee for dessert., small portion but tastes REALLY good.   Sophie makes this review a 5, otherwise I would say a 4.",

First if we had been told that we would be CHARGED $5 TO ORDER ONLINE - YES THEY CHARGE YOU $5 TO ORDER ONLINE - I would have simply called in the order. Then we were telephoned by the restaurant over an hour after we ordered that they were out of Hommus. This is after we were promised delivery in 30 to 45 minutes. It took them almost two hours to get our cold food delivered. I will never walk in to this restaurant again and I will never order online through that 24 company for this restauarant or for any restaurant they work for! THIS PLACE IS A RIP OFF!!!",

    "text": "Hahaha I love how confused we were and wondered if we opened the right door to the Shish Kabob House and had to ask someone in this banquet looking hall. The sign is to one side over by the exit door and not directly above the entrance. Because of the decor, I thought we stumbled into some sort of private hall.  It seems my comrades thought their chickens were more on the okay side so I'm drawing to a conclusion that maybe the red meats are the star? My beef kabob and lula kabob were pretty good and lamb is definitely to try next time. The LuLa was nicely seasoned and the beef kabob was tender and juicy. This isn't really \"Mediterranean\" but I guess it's easy to lump it instead of call this Armenian. Salad was good and fresh and added a bit of the \"wetness\" the meal needs, but I still think maybe the meats should come with a sauce. Rice is buttered and they use jasmine rice so it is soft and not dry at all.  The plate had roasted tomato which was yummy to mix into the food and had a roasted pepper which I thought was the usual mild sweet peppers most Mediterranean places give. Beware- its a spicy pepper and I took a big mouthful like an idiot. Delicious in small bites, but not so much in a mouthful...ouchie.   Next time I'll see if they can do a small dipping cup of their cucumber yogurt. They had it on the back listed in appetizers so I didn't even know they had some sort of yogurt...I think maybe that would be the missing link to marry all the flavors together.   For the big plate I had and a drink it was around $10 which was a good deal so this would be a good lunch spot for people in the area (like me). I will come back for the LuLa , that was pretty decent. I saw a mention of Chicken Tabaka...wasnt on the lunch so maybe I'll go during dinner to order that- been missing this dish.",

A friend recommended this restaurant and we drove 45 min to try their foods. We were not disappointed. In fact we were delighted to have found this restaurant. The foods were top notch and the service was good. The place was clean and spacious and not pretentious. We tried their beef, chicken and lamb Kabobs as well as their lamb chops. The meat was well marinated and cooked just right, tender, tasty, well presented in good amounts. The Armenian salad was great with excellent spices and was very fresh. The bread was fresh and warm. The only item that could be improved is the white rice without any seasoning, which could have been on purpose because of the seasoning  of the meats. We will be back. It ranks right up there with Hedarys in our book.",

My lady and I have ordered takeout here on three occasions.  The first time, we called in an order, and were told it would be about 30 minutes to prepare.  We showed up, and had to wait in the restaurant for an additional 20 minutes!  Wow.  We tried it again, and the same thing happened- and our order was even incorrect!  And I'm not talking, a simple mistake; I'm talking I ordered a chicken kabob and received some shrimp platter.  They called me (using caller ID I'm assuming) and offered to have a delivery driver come pick up the incorrect plate, and deliver the correct one; but by that time I didn't even want to deal with it.  On the third occasion, some months later; we were foolish enough to try it again.  After waiting the notified 30 minutes, we waited another additional 20 minutes inside, and simply walked out- and haven't been back since.  Such good cooking, I just wish they could be more organized with something as simple as a takeout order.",

I stopped going there after the last visit, their customer service deteriorated over time and they became greedy. They started charging for items that suppose to be included. For example, they charge for pita bread when you order hummus although they said its included.  The worst time when I visited last i ordered a plate with meat only, which I have been doing for a while, they charged me 8$ for a 9$ plate. In the past it used to be $6, so when I brought it to the waitress attention she stared at me responded that it was impossible that they charged that in the past, given the fact that she's only been working there 3 weeks. I asked for manager she said he's busy, not available. I paid and as I was walking out I hear her say under her breath ( stupid B****). I was furious and if I didn't have to go to work I would've camped there all day to meet with her manager. One more note. This restaurant is an ethnic one but workers there show respect only if you were armenian, I remember having to wait for 20m or so for a table although there were many empty ones while armenians visitors where seated and served immediatley upon arrival.",

About 15 mins later the waitress admitted \"the chef dropped my food\" and offered an appetizer to hold us over. We were assured our meal would be out in \"5 minutes\".  30 minutes later no food. Trying to be patient with my 2 year old and 6 month old I asked for the manager and/or owner I was informed \"they are not here\".  I asked for my food to go and refused to pay for it.  Make a long story short 1 hours and 15 mins later my food was still not done and the kitchen was scattering to put things in a to go box so I did not have a complete meltdown and my children too.

I loved the overall ambiance. The food here is amazing and the price point is great.  I have seen a few reviews stating that the music can be a tad loud, but no one was performing while we were eating.  We ordered hummus for the appetizer. The hummus had a great flavor and is very smooth. The pita bread was good as well. I ordered the lamb kabob with rice and a salad. The lamb was a tad dry but still very good. The rice was great. The vegetables in the salad were really fresh and the dressing was great. My fiance ordered the chicken lula kabob. The chicken was very juicy and cooked to perfection. He also enjoyed his salad.  Our server was extremely helpful and friendly. She checked in on us constantly and made sure we were pleased. I will definitely be coming back soon.",

The guy got lost which is understandable because the entrance for Polo Towers is hidden off the strip. I totally appreciated the fact the guy actually called to let me know what's going on! I hope he doesn't get in any trouble for getting lost!",

    "text": "Most recent visit was for my sister from another mister's birthday dinner.  Party of 14 please...  Service: The head waiter assigned to us was great.  He made sure the servers got the dishes set, glasses were filled and cleared plates asap to keep the great food coming.  When my brother from another mother's contact lens popped out, he brought over one of the sauce containers with a lid to hold it temporarily so he wouldn't lose it.  Fantastic  Food: The kabobs are my current champ in Vegas.  All the kabobs on the group platter were tasty, fresh and juicy from all my visits.  The margarine rice works so well with all the kabobs.  The hummus, Pita Bread and all vegetables accompanying the kabobs were all fresh and prepped perfectly.  Great seasoning and preparation all around.  High quality mediterranean food for a really fair price.  Value: Mid range pricing for some high quality Kabobs and tasty complimentary plates with big portions.  All the dishes we had were top notch for the price.  Good times and great value.  Ambiance:  There's a stage with a mini-dance floor at the front of the restaurant. There was some live music during dinner and some guests took the mic from to karaoke some songs sang in a Middle Eastern language.  Lots of energy and the music kept it fun.  It might be a little loud for some especially if you're on a date.  Wide Open room with lots of tables and seats.  No walls or partitions to separate the seating.  A great place to have some great kabobs with family and friends.  A little too wide open, bright and loud for a quiet date night.  The kabobs really are a treat and accompanied with the great service makes for a great casual dining experience.  The portions are so big, you're most likely be taking some of the food home which is definitely a good thing.  This is the place to be when you're fiending kabobs!",

We came here after our hiking activity at Red Rock Canyon so you can already tell that we were very hungry... Going here was the best decision because they have plenty of selection on their menu and the price was very economical! We ordered their hummus for our appetizer. For the main course, I ended up getting the chicken and beef lula combo. This dish was very flavorful and the serving was really big for the price. My sides were half rice, half fries, and salad. The serving is good for two people but I ate it all since I was really hungry. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely visit it again whenever I'm in the area.",

I always order the beef Lula kabob which if very moist and flavorful! The plate comes with salad and roasted jalapeno and tomato. Pita bread is served as well. I tried the egg-rolls with cheese which were very good. I'm not sure which cheese they use to stuff it but it's similar to Ricotta and cottage cheese. My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger and couldn't even finish it because it was so big! This place is right next door to where I live in the same shopping center as the Manan Bakery. I definitely will be returning to dine in house. For delivery it's a great option!",

The portions were so generous we had several meals off of the two dinners that we ordered. The chicken was juicy and extremely flavorful, and the beef was so tender you barely needed a knife to cut it. The rice and the side salads were very tasty. We also ordered the borscht soup which was outstanding. I also ordered the eggplant caviar which the portion was huge and was extremely good. My only advice would be if you order shish kebab with french fries ask them to put the fries on the side.",

This is a Mediterranean restaurant for sure with some Eastern European dishes, such as borcht. So good and filling!  The alcohol menu is extensive, and I recommend both Armenian beers.

Most kabob places I see don't usually have seafood options.   We ordered the beef hummus which came with a basket of warm pita, a tabbouleh salad, a beef lula plate and a beef lula & beef kabob plate. Lots of meat I know. The rice was a bit more moist than I was accustomed to and didn't have saffron pours over. The iceberg lettuce salad was meh. Everything else tasted great. I'm hoping it did because it was not because I was literally getting hunger pains prior.   Our waiter was great. Checked up on us often, refilled our water. Brought us multiple hot sauces in little cups, not the containers. Even transferred our leftovers into to go boxes. Our total for the two entrees and two appetizers was only $36. I wouldn't mind coming back. :)",

    "text": "Experience: My friend and I were looking for somewhere to go for lunch. She suggested this restaurant, because she has been there before, but not me.  Facility: It was more of a restaurant than I expected.  I thought it would be more fast food type, but it was bigger than I thought. It  has tables and chairs and a stage in the front where they obviously have music events.   Service:  I hate to do this, but this place is getting 3 stars because of the service. We walked in and they just kinda looked at us. Then they finally said we could pick any seat.  They wait staff were very friendly, but almost rudely inattentive.  Why do I say this? It started with our blonde haired waitress (I did not get her name) flirting with guys at the next table for 15 minutes, while we waited her to come back to take our order.  Then after the appetizers, she disappeared, so we had to flag down other staff. My friend said she was outside talking to those same guys.  At first, I thought she was mistaken, but then I saw her come inside 20 minutes later. Really?!?   The problem with the rest of the staff, is they weren't walking around checking on the patrons either.  They all stood at the front of the room, a few folding napkins, but most just standing around talking to each other. I posted a pic of the gathering place. Maybe the management will see this.  When they finally come around, they are friendly, but getting them to your table is the trick.   Food:  the food is great here...too bad the service sucks.  We ordered the following treats: Egg rolls - I got 3 different kinds. They were potato (2/5), beef (4/5), and cheese (5/5).  They were crispy, fresh and hot. The cheese were amazing!!! Beef hummus - very good (4/5) Mixed combo plate - delicious! (5/5) it came with chicken, steak, beef lula, lamb chops, salad, buttery rice, grilled veggies, pita bread, and French fries!  Everything on the plate was good. My fav meat were the lamb chops and my least favorite is the chicken. But the chicken was still good.  Took most of it home and it will be at least 3-4 meals. Well worth the money!  Overall: I will be back. The food was too good to not come back, but I do wish the would teach the 8+ wait staff to check on their tables. It's so rude to be across the room with empty water glasses and the staff congregating in one corner for social hour. Or completely abandoning your table to go socialize outside. I think I'll just get take out next time. :P",

Delivered dish offered the delivery with a $6.99 delivery fee and a min of a $20 order. To my surprise it is now one of my favorites. I felt the flavor wasn't too middle eastern in spice and the rice was cooked to perfection. The chicken breast kebab platter is what I chose and it wasn't a lot of chicken but enough to have left overs. The hummus was enough for a family and then some and they gave me two bags of amazing pita bread to accompany my hummus. I also ordered a medium Greek salad, it was a generous portion but I would suggest the dressing on the side.  I definitely will give this another try and I suggest you do as well. The price, convenience and great tasting food will bring you back for more.",

We have ordered from here several times and the delivery guy is always late, this is annoying but because the food was flavorful we dealt with it. The first time we ordered I got a chicken plate which comes with a salad and rice. I always eat my Mediterranean meals with a side of yogurt sauce, it's just how I roll. We asked for a side of it and it came which was great. On the next order they ignored the request and no sauce came at all. I called to complain and they said you can buy a side of it for $5. A side of sauce for $5?!?!?!? This is nearly the price of the meal itself. They now want us to buy a huge side of it which nobody can eat. I don't want or need a gallon of yogurt sauce.   Today we ordered again and I called to say I wanted a side of sauce just like the first order, the nasty lady on the phone with zero customer service skills said, sorry we can't & you need to order the $5 gallon of it. I told her this made no sense and I would no longer give them my money for the lamest nazi sauce rule in the universe. I just want a small side of it like the first round.   Dear business owner, your policy is lame and you have lost weekly orders from our office. I would gladly pay you extra for sauce but never $5 for a gallon of sauce that will go to waste. It's sad to see local businesses making poor decisions.",

    "text": "After having a craving for some fresh meats I took my boyfriend here last night. And while it's not my first time going to Shish Kabob House, last night made me a set in stone fan who will definitely be visiting on a frequent basis.  NOTE: I did notice that they had new menus printed and the prices went up just a tad recently. Nothing that would make me leave though, considering that I was surprised with how cheap they've been in the past. But I thought I'd let you know that the orange menus in the pictures are not the most recent prices.  The restaurant is in a simple room which holds a nice ambience, something my boy and I both really enjoy. There's a small stage up front on which they occasionally have live music and two TVs on opposite walls.  We started the evening by being greeted and seated immediately and ordered some hummus with pita ($4.95) for our appetizer. The pita is brought out warm and the hummus smooth and flavorful. If you happen to run out of pita before the hummus they'll bring out some more too ~  The entree menu consists of a standard plate that has salad, your choice of rice, fries or half/half, and then your choice of meats which covers practically the whole spectrum. Beef, Chicken, Lamb, Pork, Salmon and Shrimp (and there's even some \"American\" eats if you happen to have someone not so adventurous in your group). In the past I've always ordered the Lamb kabobs ('cause really, how often do you get to eat lamb?) while I sampled from my friends' plates, but I think I've officially found my regular. ($8.95 - $14.95)   #19 ($13.95) - Beef & Chicken kabob, Beef lula and a Pork chop, which I found out from our waiter could be subbed for 2 lamb chops! Perfect! I snatched up that plate while my boyfriend order just lamb chops ($14.95).  Now let me say... those lamb chops are the reason why I'm writing this review. When something blows me away, I have to tell others, and while I did have to wait extra long for my chops, our waiter said the perfect line when he brought them to me. \"Belated, but delicious!\" He couldn't be more right. I was sorry when each bite was over; The meat was tender, flavorful and perfect. Those lamb chops were seriously one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Overall I can't say anything better about this place. It's nice for a casual lunch or even if you're taking out a group for dinner. The prices are reasonable enough that you don't have to feel bad if you want a full course meal and they constantly have <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> certificates available so you can't go wrong. The portions are generous, delicious and while it may take time to get your food out, you can tell it's because everything is prepared fresh. I dare you to leave this place hungry! :]",

    "text": "I was out and about today and decided I wanted some Kabobs. I hit Google, yeah while driving and well this place popped up. Arriving at the restaurant, I was greeted by one of the waitresses. I was told to sit anywhere.    The place was nicely decorated, with flat screen TVs on the walls. It looked really sort of expensive. Well, when the menu arrived it turned out to be very reasonably priced. I ordered the Combination Kabob plate which was chicken, beef, steak and a pork chop with rice and salad.,  It was a sort of long wait to get the food. Though when it arrived I could see why. Everything seemed freshly made. The meat was hot as was the rice and something I never had in a Mediterranean type restaurant, a big roasted Serrano pepper was on the plate.  I actually lived with some Mexican friends once in California and have a real taste for Mexican food and especially peppers. So, I had to obliterate the Serrano in one fell swoop. That's right, I picked the pepper up and bit it right before the stem, chewing it well.   Now, this is nothing to me and I can finish off bags of peppers. Though, my body apparently thought different as I immediately got a case of the hiccups. Hiccups are the most irritating thing. So, I guzzle my coke and had to wait maybe 10 minutes before someone came and gave me another. Of course, the hiccups did not abate during this time.  Eventually, I got my coke and I tore into the rest of the overflowing plate. They serve their food on big square plates and the plate was filled from corner to corner. The pork chop was delicious, boiled I believe. The chicken was compatible to the best Kabobs I have had elsewhere as were the beef. I give them a 5 for 5 on food. The only complaint I have is the relative slowness of the service, though service isn't what I would term bad by any means but it was slow.   My meal was the most expensive plate on the menu and with my soda and tax the meal was less than $15. I was stuffed, two could of ate from my plate easily and been filled.",

    "text": "TL;DR - This review is based on obtaining Take-Out.  Waited twice as long as estimated time, price of food was 3 dollars higher than told over the phone.  Service was unexpected and saddening.  I logged back onto yelp after two years just to write a review for Shish Kabob House.  Before I continue any further I would like to say that the food is definitely fine, however; much is to be desired in my opinion with the service.  Order: Chicken Lula with Beef Kabob.  Ordered at 11:59 am, I was told over the phone that this specific combination is not available on the menu.  The order taker re-assured me that it's fine, she will put it in and that my total will come out to be 9.95 since it comes as a \"special order\".  I am fine with this, any other order that relates to this one is around 9.95 and 8.95.  This is completely reasonable.  The order will be ready in ABOUT 15 minutes.  I arrive at the restaurant at 12:04, much earlier than anticipated.  One waitress (out of three) notices me after sitting for about 5 minutes and proceeds to ask me if I have been seated.  I inform her that I ordered over the phone and that I am aware it should not be ready.  She is friendly and acknowledges my comment and continues to do her job.     The next time I check my phone is 12:22.  I look around and see there are a maximum of six tables occupied in the restaurant.  I sit for another three minutes, and that is when the same waitress is kind enough to check on my order for me.  12:27, a gentleman walks in and is immediately seated, and his food arrives a minute after himself.  I can only assume this gentleman had also ordered his food over the phone.  By this time I realize EVERYONE has their food.  At least two tables excluding the lone gentleman came after me.    At 12:29:50 (which is what the receipt says) I am handed my check by the same waitress and am told that my total will be $12.92.  Absent-minded I hand my card over, but I catch myself as she is ringing me up.    ----------What occurs next is what I am most discontent over---------  Up until this point I have waited patiently for 30 minutes on an order that was supposed to take 15 minutes.  During those 30 minutes I watched as everyone got their food, people before I came in and after I came in.    I stopped the waitress and explained that perhaps the price is wrong, and that I was told over the phone it was going to be $9.95.  Immediately I got a tone and haste that I only know too well myself having worked over two years in the service in industry; \"I work here and I know I am right, let me not only prove it, but also now try to rush our interaction so I can continue my job.\"  I was not questioning her knowledge of the service at the store, and up until this point she was extremely friendly and attentive.  She proceeded to show me the menu and the $11.95 priced Beef Kabob and explain her reasoning, to which she stated three times in rapid succession the reason why it's $12.92 is because \"it is an inconvenience for the chefs\".  However; EVERY combos item (beef lula/chicken kabob, etc) is in the 8.95-9.95 range.  So how is it I am being charged three dollars MORE for a beef kabob/chicken lula combo if there are combos with a beef kabob only priced at 9.95?  I informed her again that I was told a lower price over the phone, and she curtly \"apologized\" for whoever took my order.   I was handed the card receipt and left at the counter, to which I signed and left the establishment with no acknowledgement or thank you.    I don't mind paying for food.  I don't mind if I end up having to pay extra for someone else's mistake.   I don't mind waiting longer.  I don't mind watching everyone get their food before me even though they arrive later than myself.    What I DO mind is being given horrible attitude for a mistake that was NOT made by myself.  Of course I don't want to pay extra for something that was originally going to be another price, and there should be an air of courtesy tied to that.  Our time could has easily been resolved is I was told, \" I'm very sorry about that, our waitress made a mistake.  I realize also that your order took much longer than expected, allow me to charge you the price that was discussed over the phone.  However; for next time this same combination will cost you $12.92.\"  What I wrote above is acceptable service.  That is courteous service.  That is service that will make me return again and again.  I would return JUST for the same combination at $12.92 if that was the conversation we had. But that is not the case.  Instead I was treated as if \"these mistakes happen often and that I need to suck it up and pay and leave.\"  If we weren't jostling over three dollars, they would have made way more in my return.  Although the food was fine, the experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.  I don't believe I will be headed back anytime soon.",

The food on the other hand, is frickin' delicious. Comparably good as some pricier mediterranean joints. Must try their grilled meats like chicken and steak kabobs. But what keeps me coming back? Their lamb chops. Perfectly chargrilled, flavorful, not at all gamey and super cheap. For around $15,  around 4-5 chops with a generous helping of salad and rice is an awesome deal.",

When we arrived, they were very busy and there were a lot of Armenian people sitting and eating at the restaurant.  It is always a good sign that the food is going to be great when you see people of the same culture/ethnicity eating at a restaurant.  My wife ordered the lamb gyro and I went for the chicken & beef kabob platter.  It took about 30 minutes for the food to be prepared; but, given the plates we saw going to other tables, we were willing to wait.  When our food arrived, it was a lot of food; huge portions.  The chicken and lamb kabob was expertly seasoned and cooked.  My wife loved her gyro.  The rice and salad that comes with the entrees was a perfect complement the entree.  I wish we lived in Las Vegas so we could frequent this place often;but, the best I can do is to encourage and recommend it highly to others.  Oh, and the prices are really good.  The gyros platter was $8.95 and the beef & lamb kabob platter was $10.95.",

The food is always fresh and the portions big. The cornish game hen is my favorite and what I always order. The kebabs are juicy and wonderful and they have the best rice I've  ever had. A suggestion is to ask for the salad on a separate plate as it's so big it runs into your food and all runs together. This restaurant has gotten consistently better during the few years I've been going there. The service is sometimes hit or miss but is generally very good. They have entertainment in the evening and it's very nice as he doesn't play too loudly and the selection is to a large  selection of guests who would like his music.

I understand they were very busy, and had a lot of things going on (large party in the other room), large parties in the main room - but there's a way to be busy, and gracious, without so much...tension? It was outright awkward. One person in the party didn't get their food, then another guest was accused of taking that dish - but I guess the server didn't punch in the order correctly for the ticket? It was just weird and uncomfortable. Another guest asked for help in getting drinks ordered, and no one would respond. I'd have typically given it 1 star, but hopefully I came here on an atypical night, and would like to give them the benefit of the doubt...or maybe suggest take-out to fellow yelpers? :)",

We first arrived at the restaurant and no one greeted us.  We literally stood there for almost 10 minutes before I decided to walk to the back and asked someone if they can seat us.  She said, you can sit wherever you'd like, so we did.  Now we've been sitting for about 20 minutes and no one came by to help, take our drinks or anything.  I had to flag someone down so that they can provide us with menus.  At this point I am not even sure why I even stayed, but for whatever reason we did.  Now it took them like another 10 minutes to bring the menus.  Then there was the wait for someone to come and take out order.  I had to flag the waitress down.  She came to the table and rudely said, we see you, be patient.  WTH?  We've been SUPER patient.  Again, I have no idea why on earth I just did not get up and leave right then and there.  There were only 4 other parties asides from us, therefore, they weren't extremely busy.  Once the food came, no one ever came back to refill our drinks.  The food itself was not bad, however, this place fails miserably when it comes to service.  I would never go back again and would not recommend this place to anyone.  Food alone will not have people going back to a place.  My experience was just extremely horrible and it really left a sour taste in my mouth.  It was even a difficult to get our check.  I should have just walked out of there.  I really don't think anyone would have noticed.",

Who knows, which one is the cause, all food except fresh veggies salad tastes not like it suppose to and now I don't feel good. My opinion - if you decide to eat there, drink some too, to kill the bacteria (; Desserts very limited and not look like pics. No ice cream. Drinks very limited.  Waiters super friendly though...",

    "text": "Being krazy about kabobs, I had to compare this place to our favorite kabob spot in town, Zaytoon. Here is the verdict:  Hummus - Zaytoon is superior. Better hummus and they serve freshly baked piping hot bread. At Shishkabob House (SH), you get pita bread from a package, sliced up and warmed. The hummus at SH also was very cold and obviously had been refrigerated for who knows how long.  Rice - I give the nod to Zaytoon for True basmati rice and bigger serving.  Kabobs - Tie. They both are juicy and flavorful. Delicious.  Ambience - while SH is more of a True restaurant, once again I am subjected to incessant music playing at too high a volume. It's bad enough that they play only wimpy Lilith Fair songs one after the other, but then periodically an ad gets played as well. Quite annoying to hear a silly ad for Jack in the Box in the middle of your meal. If you don't mind the half-market apperanace of Zaytoon, then this one is also a tie.  Bottom line: For my dollar, Zaytoon is still #1. No other place beats it in town.",

They had this eggplant appetizer that comes with pita bread that I couldn't find anywhere but back when I lived in Virginia. I ordered the beef and chicken kabob platter that came with salad and an option for fries or rice. I chose the rice. It was so good. I couldn't even finish it all. It's definitely worth the price, especially for heavy eaters. The service was great! The server checked up on us to make sure our orders were correct. I tried the Armenian coffee. It's heavy and strong so I recommend only for coffee lovers. :D it was an awesome experience for sure.",

I love the dressing and you get a good amount of salad on your plate.  I always add some black pepper to it and a little extra lemon.  The rice is always fluffy and actually tastes good unlike most places.  You also get a grilled tomato, hot pepper and pita bread.  You get a lot of very good food for a low price.       The wait to get your food takes a longer than other place but that is expecting because everything is fresh.    They always take good care of me when I ask for extras and don't charge for them.

The hummus was delicious and you can't go wrong with hummus. I was impressed with the prices as well. This place is maybe $3-5 cheaper than the other places, but it doesn't mean that the quality of food declines. We ordered the beef kebab, beef lula, and lamb kebab. You can request to get half French fries and half rice. The lamb kebab was well seasoned and tender. It was juice and flavorful! The beef lula, is like a koobideh. It was well seasoned and cooked well. The grilled tomato with the rice and meat was on point.  I will say, I liked the lamb better the the beef lula, but both were yummy. They also have live entertainment. The environment was awesome and it's even a great place for first dates, if you don't want to break the wallet and have awesome food and entertainment.",

    "text": "What a difference a few years makes! We didn't realize how long it's been since we've been to Shish Kabob House. After eating here again, we know it has been waaay too long.  Friends are visiting our great city in order to house hunt (yay!), and we wanted to show them how to eat like a local. We got there first and almost didn't recognize it: it has been redone, modernized, rearranged, and much nicer.  When we were seated, a one-man band was playing a keyboard, starting with several songs that evoked stirring memories of my childhood and my mother. But his music covered a variety of genres, so there was something for everyone. Well, no rap or heavy metal, sorry :) Unfortunately, a while later, a large group seated near him got him to turn the volume up to ear-ringing levels, so much so that my friend and I, seated inches apart next to each other, couldn't even have a conversation. He turned it down about 3/4 of the way through our meal when the group left, but that's my only complaint. I would like management to realize that some people like to talk during dinner; we weren't at a Bar Mitzvah, where you know in advance that you'll go deaf from the music.   What hasn't changed much is the menu. Oh, the prices have gone up a dollar or two, but that's over a period of several years. It's still a great value for the huge amount of food, and the wine prices are very reasonable, too.  Our server was Peter, and he was wonderful. My friend ordered the sturgeon, something I've never had. Peter said he'd bring her the (very tangy) sauce on the side, saying he loved it but wanted to make sure she'd like it, too. He was extremely attentive throughout the meal. I tasted her fish and thought it was delicious. I'll probably have it next time. Our Kabob Combo dinners, which we ordered with lamb chops that were tender and juicy, were fabulous. There's a choice of the lamb or pork chops. We will enjoy the rest of it tomorrow night!  Lots of Mediterranean restaurants have opened since we first found Shish Kabob House. Many of them are pretty good, but we're happy to have re-discovered this place. Despite the music problem, I'm upping it to 5 stars, because the food, value, and service can't be beat.",

The food variety  is high with different dishes including names I cannot pronounce as an American.   The restaurant has an A rating and EXTREMELY CLEAN. Staff is very good, neat, clean and knowledgeable about each dish.  There is lve music in the evening that is not overbearing and in very good taste. Plenty of parking but you may want to call for reservations in the evening.  Prices great, large Greek Salad $6.95 and 4 chops w/ salad, rice, peppers and tomatoes with Greek salad $13.99.",

When I called in I asked if they had a veggie kabob, which they said they did. I settled on that.   The \"veggie kabob\" was mainly bell peppers and onion. There was one piece of tomato and one hot pepper, a lot of bell pepper, and even more onions. It was served on a bed of rice with a side of Greek salad and pita bread.   The veggies were good though I wish there were other veggies like mushrooms or eggplant or something more than just bell peppers and onions. The rice and pita bread = carb overload. The Greek salad was good though it was light on dressing so it was a little dry.   I have had veggie kabobs from other places that were so much better.   Shish Kabob House earns the \"meh\" 3 star review. It wasn't horrible but I have had much better.",

Once She finally took our order after 30 min she said it would take 25 min for food. We reluctantly ordered that was the worst mistake I ever made the twilight zone music should of been playing in the background. after 45 min of waiting I stopped her passing by our table and asked about our food she said it would be another 10 min and then she said the food was taking about 35 min to come out that should of been a sign for me to leave right then. But I decided to wait the 10 min. That was another stupid decision. I waited 20 more min. And the stopped her again and ask her were the food was she said it was coming. I asked to speak to the manager. I am not kidding she left and did not come back. next time I saw her 10 min later she was bringing food to another table that came 45 min after us and we ordered the same dishes. I was livid by this point. And asked to speak to the manager to another waiter and he said the didn't have one. I felt like punching out everyone in that place. I just had to leave before that happened.  by the I was seated at a table with folding legs you know the kind they sell for picnics at sams club.",

Another 10 mins gotten by, and no one even greeted us or gave us the menu. Then, another 20 mins, we left. No one bother to say goodbye or anything. Guess what?

There was also a salad on the plate with a slight lemon dressing. It was wonderful! A pita bread finished out the plate, and for the price it couldn't be beat!

I haven't been disappointed with a single dish that I've ordered here both when I've eaten in and when I've ordered carry out.  Their lula style kabobs are the kabomb and the pork chops are so juicy.  Careful of the peppers that come with your meal because they pack a wallop so be sure to have plenty of water nearby.  A word to the wise, good things come to those who wait and this is in no way to be considered fast food that you can come and sit down and be served.

We all sat down and had our lunch and not one person was happy with the quality and or flavor.  Each persons comment was the same - no flavor and the salad is literally drowned in oil, soggy and completely flavorless nor did one person eat any of their salad. After lunch one of the people who ordered the meal attempted to call the manager of the restuarant to complain about first off - increasing the prices and not updating it on the internet (esp since they offer delivery service) second the quality of food and of course the fact that the individual that delivered the food could have cared less when it was brought to their attention.  Evidently, the person answering the phone didn't care either because she said \"The manager isnt here\" and did not even offer to take a message let alone apologize.  Dont eat here! Dont order from here! And if you do and want to complain, dont bother!

    "text": "Earlier this evening I attended Shish Kabob House. It is located off of Flamingo in a very unsuspecting spot with various other shops around. The parking lot was small but the Kabob House seemed to be the biggest place in the area so I had no difficulty finding it. Immediately upon entering I was met with very friendly staff that asked me if I was dining in.  The ambience of this restaurant seems to be casual yet visually captivating. Simple modern designs with a stage for music at the front immediately make this place stand out amongst other kabob places I have encountered.  The menu is very helpful for first timers of Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean food, as it has photos of each plate (all of which look delicious).  I ordered the Pork Kabob and chose baba ghanoush as an appetizer. The baba ghanoush was brought out with warm pita bread, and I do not hesitate to say that it is the most flavorful that I have tried in the states. It had a light but creamy texture, with accents of eggplant and garlic. I was pleased to see that it was not as grainy as previous baba ghanoush that I have tried. After enjoying my appetizer my pork kabob arrived in a timely manner on a very large dinner plate. The kabob was accompanied by Armenian salad, white rice, a roasted tomato, and roasted jalapeno pepper. The salad was finely chopped and oil was used as a dressing, the vegetables tasted refreshing and crispy. Next I tried the rice, which was spectacular. It had a very buttery flavor and texture. Finally I tried the pork which was by far the most flavorful kabob I've ever experienced. The spices are effectively used to provide a great flavor profile that doesn't take away from the meat itself. The pork was tender and not dry in the least. The salad, rice, and meat all compliment each other in a great way. Overall this restaurant was a great experience and you can't beat it especially for the price! I will certainly become a regular at Shish Kabob House!",

Obviously there was some kind of mix up and our order was not placed. When we addressed the issue with our server he went to the back and they keep saying only 5 more minutes. It's now 5 pm we have been waiting 50 minutes and a server an older lady comes out screaming at us telling us it's only been 20 minutes calling us liars everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us it was so embarrassing!!! Also no apology even when I calmly was explaining to her that she was wrong and embarrassing us. She then went behind the bar and was pointing at us and laughing. That attitude is horrible, disgusting and extremely rude you are a server in the service business learn to treat people with respect and dignity and especially when they are customers and treating you with respect and dignity.

Lamb Kabob was great (thanks darling for sharing!). I got the Beef and Chicken Lula. Chicken was moist and delish. Beef was the same. I do think that I should have followed out hosts lead and got the combo platter. More variety. Lamb chops looked divine. If it had been the wife with the combo plate, I would have sampled.

Not even a thank you or goodbye.   Since she was so knowledgeable about the menu and the way she spoke to me, I firmly believe she was the manager. They can be very friendly people, so it shocked me that I experienced this. If she was having a bad day, just go home and don't ruin the customer's experience next time. The restaurant's reputation should not be affected by people's attitudes, especially if the food is this great. I will say, my husband spoke to her and everything was cleared up and we received an apology from her directly. Therefore, I give them 4 stars since she handled everything accordingly and politely. Thank you, we'll be returning again!",

My three favorite appetizers were the Armenian salad, crab salad, and hummus. The chicken and beef kabobs were perfectly cooked and had amazing flavor.   It absolute shocks me to think someone would rather pick the boring banquet menu compared to this flavorful experience. I understand that people may be worried if the food was too ethnic. But I have a low tolerance for spice, and I found the food perfect. It did have a bit of spice, but the rice complimented it well. The flavors were on point.   Not only do I look forward to having this food at my wedding, but I look forward to coming back to the restaurant for lunch or dinner. I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was on the inside, and the live music created a lovely atmosphere. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant!",

I got the lentil soup which makes 2 cups and was really good too. My favorite was he tabouleh which was a large portion and exactly how I like it. They delivered with flatbreads which was nice. I really like Mediterranean food and this did its job well. There's free delivery but there's a minimum amount to order that's why I ordered so much.",

While the food is tasty, the service felt extremely slow. Our server didn't fill our glasses and while it was busy, there were plenty of workers, so it didn't really make sense why she was so inattentive.  They also had a live singer/keyboardist who was awfully loud. It was hard to talk to the people at your table because of how loud the musician was. I would come here again, but order to-go. Good food, but lack-luster service and way too loud when a performer is there.",

    "text": "We were referred here by a friend of the owners, \"Dr B\" who said this was the best shish-kabob place in Vegas.  The first time we tried to go here was a Saturday night a few weeks ago about an hour before closing. It was packed with the waiting area completely full. We walked in, waited about 5 minutes and observed the majority of the servers bickering behind the counter, no one acknowledged us, and a seated patron walk up to the counter to complain that they had been seated for a while with no waitress tending to them. In a mood and starving, we walked out and went elsewhere for dinner.  The following Saturday night we gave it another go, this time arriving by 7pm.  It was half full but we were seated immediately, at the table closest to the entrance (boo!).   Hubs ordered the lamb chops and the chicken soup after our server said both were the best in town. I ordered the combo plate so that, between the hubs and I, we could sample each of the meats.  The lamb chops were good but had a lil bit too much seasoning kick for my hubs bland palette. The chicken soup looked like any other homemade chicken soup had a uniquely rich and hearty chicken vegetable flavor.  The salad and rice that came with our meals were great; the chicken, pork chop and sirloin (?) in the combo platter were delish, however the ground beef kabob was flavorless and we didn't care for it.  Our server was great while she attended to us, but it took what seemed like a really long time for our main dishes to arrive, and she didn't really check on us. It became extremely busy after we walked in and a lot of people picked up to-go orders.  There appeared to be a few larger parties celebrating something g prior to our arrival and we noticed that they didn't get their food for a long time as well.  The live music/musician was nice considering the restaurant was bustling and loud.   I would definitely return to sample other menu items, but maybe on a weeknight for an early dinner - maybe the service would be better and our food wouldn't take as long??",

The place always seems to be clean, with table cloths on the tables. The only confusing thing is the entrance all three times we've been here the entrance was a different door My guess is they use the partitions in the dining area for private parties or something and that changes the entrance that's being used or something like that",

The waiter wasn't attentive at all I had to wave him down every time. Horrible",

Meats were cook perfectly and seasoned  just right! eggplant caviar and hummus came with flat bread. They are only about 5 dollar but it was big portion compare to price. Oh!

    "text": "I love the food at Shish Kabob House and was so happy when they offered free delivery to my home on Grub Hub. When the delivery disappeared from Grub Hub, I checked their website and saw they delivered if I called the restaurant, so I did. The girl who answered the phone asked me to hold and put the phone down, taking another delivery order from someone on another line which totaled $23 and change. When she came back to me, I inquired how much the delivery charge was - she huffed and told me it depended where I was. When I told her, she said they did not deliver to my location. When I explained they had before, she rudely told me it must have been a mistake and that she has answered the phone there for 1 1/2 years and they wouldn't have done that. I told her specifically where I was and she told me that they would deliver to me for a $10 delivery charge and the minimum order would be $50! At that point, it was obvious she did not want to take my $25 order, so I gave up. Management definitely needs to re-train this girl regarding customer service, or not allow her to answer the phone if she is going to continue to treat the customers so rudely.",

    "text": "The food is flavorful and healthy.  My wife introduced me to the Shish Kabob House.  Some drug reps brought it to her work a few times.  She brought home some left overs.  We love ethnic food, but rarely eat Mediterranean style cuisine.  We started with an order of Humus $4.95.  I think that is too much for humus, but it is really good and there is a lot of it.  The humus comes in a large tub and they constantly refill the pita basket.  It is a lot of food.  You will be tempted to fill up on it while waiting for your entree.  The food takes a really long time to come out.  They are so slow.  While waiting we admired the dining area.  Seems to be well decorated.  Not many guests, but lots of family hanging around.  Turns out the place is Armenian, not Greek.  I know nothing of Armenian cuisine, but seems the same to me.  The food finally arrived and the portions were big.  Everything seemed super fresh.  The meat and grilled veggies were hot, juicy, and flavorful.  I love this food.  Plus, grilled items are healthier.  The meat was so juicy, not dried out.  The jalapeno pepper was hot.  I like slicing the tomato on the bed of rice.  The juices run and the rice soaks up the flavor.  I ordered the #19 Combo Kabob $14.95, which came with one pork chop, four pieces of beef kabob, and four pieces of chicken kabob.  Although it was good, I liked the pork chop the least.  My wife ordered the #5 Beef Lula Kabob $8.95.  It is like an uncased sausage grilled on a stick.  The seasoning was wonderful.  I think all entrees come with a Mediterranean salad, pita, grilled tomato, grilled jalapeno pepper, and white rice.  We could not finish the food and had to get a to-go-box.  I could not leave without a piece of baklava.  It taste good, but one little piece cost $2.95.  I think that cost too much for such a small piece.  I really, really like this place and recommend it highly, but beware, they are so slow and some of the pricing is a bit high.  (Entrees are priced fairly, but appetizer and dessert are a little high.)  Also, we went back twice since then and every time the food was so, so slow.  Don't try to squeeze this place in for a work lunch.",

The lamb chops and lamb kabobs Ive had here are the best I've ever eaten.  The Beef Lula and Chicken Lula Kabobs are also amazing. The portion sizes are HUGE and most of the entrees cost around ten bucks. I have no idea how they make any money charging so little for so much food. This place is always full, so don't expect to walk in here in the evening and find an easy table. We usually try to visit early on the weekdays around 5 and we always get sat pretty quickly. The ambiance is semi-casual. All of the tables are arranged in a large room, so you won't get a ton of privacy, but it feels classy. The have live music at night on the weekends, usually a guy playing the piano.   The food always takes about 20 minutes to come out, but its well worth the wait. The wait staff here is really good. Sometimes when I'm in town, I'll hit this place 3 times in 3 days. Not kidding.  God bless the Shish Kabob House.",

Not a healthy period, but a damn enjoyable one.  I actually preferred to have them delivered, rather than to eat in the restaurant, because by the time they got to my house, the juice from the chops had flavored the bed of rice up quite nicely.  The salad usually is dressed a little heavily, but there are plenty of veggies and not just a bunch of iceberg lettuce.    Price is LOW for chops this fine.    Eating IN the restaurant is kind of an odd experience, as the mix of fine linen, diner-type menu, large screen TV's, and \"exotic\" foods can be jarring for some.    But, whatever.  Lamb Chops.  Eat them.",

We'll be the judge of this.\"   After: Them: \"OMG, this is the best Medit. food we've ever had!!!!\"  We went for dinner, eat in.

Just figure its a mom-n-pop place, they don't have a \"customer service coach\" to help them polish up the nuances of what makes us all happy to be waited on.   Go for the food, and just chill re: customer service. They try hard, and that counts.  (PS - my first time there, I arrived in the late afternoon and ordered take out - it took awhile. Unless you want to wait at least 45min playing with your iPhone while you're food is prepared, do call ahead.)",

    "text": "This is one of the best quality Mediterranean places in Las Vegas.  As a local we have tried everywhere, and this is among the top 5.  The Chicken Kabob is the best in Vegas.  Tender, seasoned and grilled perfectly.  Always cooked to order.  The specialty platters are enormous, so don't order unless you are hungry.  The Greek Salad has a near perfect light and flavorful dressing, the only downside is depending on who is in the kitchen you may get overly large lettuce chunks which makes eating awkward.  It is recommended you ask them to toss your salad for you, it will evenly spread the dressing and Fetta around - completely changes the flavor and quality.  If you like hummus, get the hummus with seasoned beef. Out of this world and simple but flavorful.    The decor and ambience are the only downsides.  You feel like you are in a covered hotel banquet room, or having dinner at a retirement home. The lighting, background music, and overall space are a 2 out of 5.   Service is a hit or miss.  A few of the staff there are fantastic, but, they randomly handle tables and so you sometimes may wait to get acknowledged.  However, the food quality if worth the wait.  WARNING:  Ordering to-go is a painful experience unless you tell them you will be there in 15-20 minutes.  I have ordered sometimes, showed up 45 minutes later, and they were still not ready.  If you don't tell them you need it fast, you will wait a while. And walk-in takeout is the worst - just plan on a long wait.",

This place was close by and I saw the reviews on it that it was awesome and I love kabobs, and lambs so hey! perfect right? NOT!  Ordered online for delivery. It says it will take 45min to 1 hour for delivery. We ordered 2 lamb and 1 beef. And hour and half later, nothing yet. Gave them a call and they said that the food just finished and was on the way. 20 more minutes passed... the driver called and was lost. 20 minutes later, got the food. At least they gave us a discount since the food took so long. The reason it took so long? It was WAYY overcooked. The meat was all dry and chewy and doesn't have much flavor. Defintely not impressed.  Maybe eating there is different, but not a good delivery experience. Food was cold upon delivery. Though the portion was decent, but not gonna try again.",

Check them out during the weekend nights for so crazy Armenian music star to drop hey and do a set. It's a good time even if you don't like the music.

    "text": "The Lamb...OMFG THE LAMB!!! I'll have cravings of the lamb chops for the next few months thanks to this place.  Okay here's the story, Buddy and I planned on hitting up Mother's Korean BBQ in China town. I no longer felt up to it and decided i needed a Kebab (I dont care to me it's KE-BAB, i talk about KE-BABS with my British and Australian friends it's not a kah-bob it's KE-BAB). My buddy works around the area and orders delivery at least twice a week. TWICE A WEEK?! other then rice i dont eat anything twice a week willingly. We GOTTA check this place out.  We arrived at 9:45 and closing is at 10:00. The staff allowed us to dine in regardless of their closing time. Our waitress was brand new and possibly fumbled our order so another waitress came over to confirm everything. Now some would consider this an annoyance because they should have got it right the first time but i actually approve of this. It's better to ask again and get it right rather then follow through only to discover someone made a mistake somewhere.  We both ordered #19s (Combo Kebab) but with personal touches.  I had a straight 19 which has Rice, Salad, Grilled Chili & Tomato, A Pork Chop, two of each Chicken & Beef Kebabs, and a Beef Lula kebab.  Buddy had the same but replaced his rice with half rice half fries, all beef kebabs, and a chicken lula.  We also had a side of lamb chops were were...what ever i'll say it...ORGASMIC   Rice: had that classic flavor found in middle eastern, indian, and mediteranean cuisine. I have been unable to replicated and havent found a female of listed above ethnicity to date so the rice will still impress me until i learn it's secrets.   Beef Kebab: Perfectly seasoned not too dry but not all that juicy. Had a lot of flavor and was very tender. Epic Win  Chicken Kebab: Same as the beef but with chicken. Epic Win  Beef Lula Kebab: Nice flavor but the texture is what got me, it seemed softer then burger meat but had twice the flavor. The overly soft texture didnt sit too well with me but then again i ate it all. Epic uh...not sure if i like it but there's no trace of it on my plate  Chicken Lula Kebab: Perfect just perfect, the flavors and most importantly the texture was perfect. Epic Perfection  Pork Chops: No impact No idea. All i know is it fits VERY nicely in the to go box. Not a small pork chop either mine covered nearly half the plate. Epic Breakfst  Side of Lamb Chops: Words can not begin to describe...Should have sent a Poet. In all seriousness i was ready to throw my entire plate on the floor and completely devote the next few minutes to munching on these lamb chops. We as Americans need to embrace Lamb more...Epic Lamb  Having a salad on the side is a very nice way to balance out the savory and the salty with crunchy tartness. The Pita bread wasnt fresh but i cant expect more when they stayed open late to accommodate us very close to their closing time.   Overall two combo plates, two sodas, customization on one of the combo plates, and a side of 4 pieces of lamb chops for 40 dollars.  WAIT WHAT?!?! 20 quid per person?! that's a 22oz steak @ the Cortez Room...That's All you can eat Korean BBQ @ Sula...here 20 bucks not only got us each a combo plate but the Lamb too?!   Sorry my other favorite place for cheap eats you've already been forgotten and replaced with Shish Kebab House...",

We were both excited because the food had been so good on our previous visit.  We walked in and there was an solo Entertainer in the front and we asked if we could sit towards the back so it would not be so loud, which they were happy to do for us.  Our charming waiter took our drink order right away and brought them right back and took our order.  We ordered two appetizers, Hummus and Tabbulhu (sorry about the spelling)  then we order the beef and chicken kabobs.  Our appetizers came and the portions was huge !!!  They were delicious and fresh.  Our meals came, same thing , huge and perfect, meat was so tender, seasoned well, the salad that came with it was delicious.  Our meal was perfect.  The place was slamming, it was packed with people the whole time we were there.  Our waiter did a good job especially with the crowd he had to deal with. The location is a bit strange, but once you find it and know where it is you will surely be back again and again, like I will. As far as price point, the place is cheap, my kabob meal was 9.95 and I had enough to take home with me.  Appetizers were 4.95 each and we both took some of those home there was so much left, believe me this place is a deal.",

Can I tell you that all past and future Med experiences will undoubtedly pale in comparison and ruin you for life?  Shish was our last stop and final meal in Vegas on the birthday trip my sister gave me and it was the high point of the entire food portion of our time there!  We stayed at Planet Hollywood Towers, (awesome) and so partook of Earl of Sandwich based on Yelp reviews (of course) but, meh...had the Thanksgiving turkey thing...warm mayo, yuck but thank God we hit the Shish leaving town.  All the comments about the big open room thing are True but our lady server was a sweet as her lamb chops and we loved our time there.  Seriously, the lamb...OMGoodness...the lamb.  We begged her to come to San Diego and she smiled, knowingly.  I'm sure they get this all the time as the realization sets in that one is never going to get to have these lamb chops at home...maybe she was just a little creeped out by all four of us making our yummy noises in ecstasy.  I love you, Shish.  Come to San Diego.  Please.",

(Yes, they deliver).  I usually just stick with the Hummus with Beef, which is perfectly done hummus -accompanied by  warm beef on top with plenty of warm pita. Main course I usually indulge with the #3 ? Chicken Kabob & Beef Lula that comes with a heeping side of rice and Armenian salad, oh and a charred jalapeno and tomato - yummy .   Service is great and attentive, there's plenty of vodka and huge bottles of Russian beer for under $5. The food is big portions, enough for the gf and I to share ..  If you have a sweet tooth... The BAKLAVA is on point.  Sticky and sweet, honey and pistachio with phyllo dough .. Can't go wrong there. If baklava isn't your thing, right next door is an Armenian bakery - Manan Bakery which is AMAZEBALLS !!!",

The second time, I ordered beef lula(ground beef), and asked to have extra meat and agreed to an extra charge of course. I guess I should have been more inquisitive as they charged me for a full-priced second entree and simply doubled the meat portion on my plate. (I guess that makes the rice, salad, and bread worthless? Lol) Anyways, two of the kabobs were cooked well, and looked flame grilled. The other two were pink and mushy in the middle. Really?

This place cured my itch for the next week or so :)  The more acquainted I become with Yelp and Grubhub, the better my munching experiences are!   I wasn't too hungry - a friend and I just wanted something delicious to nosch on without having to go anywhere or spend too much money. So, after reading decent reviews, I decided to give this place a shot.   I ordered a salad and a couple apps : dolmas(ALWAYS...as it is my favorite thing to eat in the whole wide world - if made properly), hummus, tabouleh, and the Armenian salad.   This place has exceeded any expectations I could've ever allowed myself to ever have!   The food arrived within 35mins - the delivery man was very kind and the food!! Omg the food is still blowing my mind. Exactly what I wanted and my palate is completely satisfied. I swear my stomach even mumbled a \"thank youuuu\" :-))))   For the price, the portions are very, very generous! The flavors are all spot on - the ingredients very fresh; you can tell this food was made with love.   I'll be ordering from them again, no doubt!",

This is the food I grew up eating and it's the closest I've found to my mom's home cooked meals. The service is outstanding and the restaurant is super clean. I find it absolutely ridiculous people on here complain about the menu being laminated and the decor looking like a \"hotel ballroom.\"  You have to respect that this is a cultural thing and most family operated Middle Eastern joints look like that. Part of the reason is that they host numerous types of gatherings/celebrations in their restaurants so that is why they have that \"ballroom\" appeal. Anyways, if you make your way over here I highly suggest you try the Stuffed Grape Leaves, Beef Luna, and Chicken Kabob! Outstandingly fresh food!",

The menus all have pictures which I like. They come out in big servings so come prepared to eat.   I had the gyro and you have an option of getting fries or rice or a combo of both. It also came with salad.   My friend had the combo plate which came with the chicken, lamb chops, and some ground meat. Chicken was dry and tasteless.   My hubby had the lamb kabob plate and the meat was ok. There were a few pieces that was over cooked/burnt.

She sent the driver who again got the order wrong it was supposed to be half rice/half fries this time she gave us all rice.

And they took an hour and 4 calls later for them to bring the correct order!!!! Never again!!!

On the 3rd of May, I was driving home on my motorcycle down Hacienda and I am about to make a left turn onto Jones, when their Fiat with the plate number SKH2 almost hit me, not even paying attention to the road because he was to busy reading a piece of paper. I try to chase him down, but he runs a red light at Russell and Rainbow. When I get home, I called their restaurant and asked for a supervisor, I got hung up on. So, I called a second time, asked for a supervisor again and explained what had happened, they hang up on me again. The third time, I called they finally took my number and said that their supervisor would contact me the next day. I guess they forgot to tell the supervisor.

Some plate of awesomeness with beefy goodness and then some pork chop looking things on it (at least in the picture!). The waitress asked if I wanted lamb or pork, and I decided to go with the lamb based on Yelp reviews. The beefy things (kafta kabob + steak) were insanely tasty. Then came the \"lamb\". The sad thing is I'm still confused about whether I ate lamb or pork! I know, ridiculous! So it was pale and whitish like pork, but it had the size and taste of lamb (well sort of!). I've never seen white lamb so I'm uber confused? Neither me nor my carnivorous coworker could figure it out. LOL.  She got a chicken platter thing served with those chicken lula meatballs. She found them disgusting, I found them tolerable. Definitely not something either of us would order again.   As others have mentioned, the decor is bizarre. You've got these casual tacky laminated menus, you've got decent prices but you're dining in what seems like a hotel ball room. A bit odd!   Overall I'd go back, but I'd probably stick to the beef.",

Yogurt sauce with pita: pita was hard and dry and cold. Just as you'd buy at your local grocery store 3. Gyro: was supposed to come with fries instead with buttery rice.   Consisted of 6 thin slices of disgusting meat with tomatoes and onions on it.  A side salad that was as gross as the Greek one.       We threw out everything.   Horrible horrible horrible.",

    "text": "The Shish Kabob house is a wonderful family oriented dining experience. A visit to this restaurant was a special treat because I was dining with my sister, brother-in-law, and my darling nephew!   Of course, dinner was delicious with the first courses being hummus (great texture and flavor), tabuleh (fresh herbs, bright flavors, and a zesty diced tomatoes), and cucumber yogurt (finely diced cucumbers with creamy texture) Overall, I'd give the appetizers a solid 3.5   For  my main course, both my nephew and I ordered the lamb chops. Our entree came with a side of Greek salad (the salad was a bit wilted and the dressing was bland), Roasted tomato and jalapeno (perfectly charred), rice (a bit soggy), and lamb chops (my medium rare order was actually served medium well, and my nephew's well done order was so over cooked that  even one of the bones split in half when he picked the lamb chop up). However, even though they were over cooked, they still tasted good with only a mild gamey flavor. Overall, I'd give the main entree a 3.0  The service however was excellent. Our server was attentive and persistent. He had a cheery demeanor, happily provided us with our special requests (extra lemons ~ great drizzled over the lamb chops, and tabasco sauce for my brother in law's lula kabob.) Overall, I'd rate the service a solid 4.0  Lastly, the ambiance was very nice. They had a birthday party celebration and the restaurant was fully booked which my have accounted for the food being over cooked as in previous dining experiences, according to my sister, the food was much better prepared.   Tips: They accept <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> gift cards, bring a little extra soy sauce to complement the rice (my nephew's advice), and request for the salad dressing to be served on the side. Also, they have live entertainment on Saturdays which would make for a great date night!   Price:  Appetizers $4.95 Entrees: $7.95 - $14.95 Beverages: $1.50 - $3.00 Wine & Spirits are also served  Food Paparazzi's Overall Score: 3.5  Would I come back? Yes (Great value and good times!)

The servings were way bigger than we expected but we didn't complain since we came in with empty stomachs.   We started with some hummus and tabbouleh. The hummus was so good we had to keep asking for more pita bread so we could finish all of it. I never tried tabbouleh before, but it was pleasantly fresh and tasty.   You MUST get the lamb kabob or lamb chops. It was cooked to perfection, so tender and moist! It came along with a small salad and you get to choose between fries or rice for your other side, definitely go for the rice. It can get a little pricey with hungry people, but it's worth it with the huge serving you get. The only downside was that though our appetizers came out fairly quick, our entrees didn't. My father received his dish first, leaving my mother and I to wait what felt about another 15-20 for our entrees.   Minus the wait time, the food was so good we came back a few days later to order food to bring home. So glad we gave this place a try!",

    "text": "Came here about a week ago to pick up an order that we called in. We ordered the lamb chops, a beef/chicken kabob combo, a lamb/pork kabob combo (not on their menu, but they kindly combined it for us at no extra charge), and an order of dolmas. This was our first time trying this establishment and didn't realize it was more of a dine-in restaurant until we arrived there. That being said, the place is about a 10 minute drive from our house.   When we arrived and said we were there to pick up our take-out order, the hostess told us it would be about another 7 minutes. That's fine. There was live music there to keep us entertained during the wait. As we waited, we noted the pleasant decor and atmosphere of the place. Impressive for just a \"house of shish kabob\". As we waited, we were kindly approached by another employee to ensure that we were being taken care of. After about a 15 minute wait, we still had not received our items. That in addition to the 10 minutes it took us to drive here. After about another 10 minutes, our bagged items finally arrived. All in all, it was a total wait of 35 minutes from the time I called in, until the time the items were ready. That's an very long wait for take-out in my book.   The wait was disappointing although truth be told, they were extremely busy since it was a Friday night. The hostess finally handed us our items along with the bill and noted to us that 20% was already taken off of our bill due to our long wait. Needless to say, we were extremely appreciative of the gesture. That was totally unexpected and a great display of ensuring customer satisfaction.   Now onto the food!!! What can I say? Outstanding. Definitely the best shish kabob I've had in Vegas and that I can recall in a long time. The chicken, beef, lamb, and pork were all moist and flavorful, and the lamb chops were terrific as well. The dolmas were okay, but it's a tall order to beat the homemade dolmas that my Lebanese neighbor used to make.   All in all, the food was superb and the portions were large. Heck, even the bed of rice that the meats sat on was delicious. The quality of the food and the fact that they made up for the long wait by giving us a discount made this a win-win for us. We will definitely be back.   Shish Kabob House, you've just earned yourself a loyal and repeat customer.",

I can understand some people's comments about the \"East European service\" demeanor of some of the servers, but honestly, when you accept that they are all from a different environment you set aside expectations for cheerful-Applebees-Disney servers. Expect direct and more formal than American chains. But really, my friends and I go here enough that they know us, even joke around and treat us very well.",

After taking my father here for Father's Day one year, this restaurant quickly became a favorite spot for taking friends, family, and dates.   The atmosphere is fairly nice, and the waitstaff are always very friendly, and very neatly dressed. Occasionally they do have live music, and the performances that I've seen have always been good.  I would definitely recommend the lamb, but I have yet to order something from here that I didn't like. The beef is awesome, the chicken is great, and the salads are too. You really can't go wrong here. Pricing is very as well, especially considering the quality of the food.  One final thing of note is the hummus, and the roasted peppers that they garnish the dishes with. The hummus is some of the best I've ever had. The peppers are a little bit challenging if you're not used to hot food, but they're too good not to eat.",

Finally for the perfect summer cool, Greek salad with chicken kebab or salmon. The portion was huge and prices were reasonable. The only thing they could've improved on is that my chick kebab was a little dry and burnt....uh oh. Nonetheless, overall it was an experience worth having.

    "text": "Appearance can be very, very deceiving. From a little Mediterranean joint, this place came a long way. Very fancy decor and I believe they have live music instruments as well. I went there after seeing it a while back expecting the same corner food joint, instead we found a chic restaurant that looks like something you'd see on food network with the lack of a proper host and cloth napkin.  The food sucks and let me point out why. With appetizer (Domas), we were given the store bought and cold PITA bread (Notice the caps) with nothing to dip it with and with no butter. Rice with the order of # 7 were the type of rice they serve with Enchiladas. Chicken Kabobs were dry and the beef kabobs were unevenly cook. Some were well done while other were mid-well. Did I mention the paper menu which resembles the pizza menu you get on your door locks. Salad was just ok.  Service was somewhat impressive. Our server was very polite and gave a very professional impression. Halfway between ordering and getting our food, the music stops causing an uncomfortable amount of silence. 5 mins later, it resumed again. I couldn't actually tell where the music was from, didn't sound like Arabic or Persian. Could be Pashto.  In short, if you go for the food, don't expect anything close to Fresh Kabob on Sunset/Eastern where they serves fresh bread and Basmati rice. Pay $14 for plate with 6 pieces of Kabob look-alike Meat, rice you'd find in a Mexican taco shop with store bought pita bread but decor like a fancy restaurant at the strip. This is a classic example of when neighborhood food joints try to become a fancy restaurant and forget what got them a 3 thousand square-feet restaurant, THE FOOD.",

I always have left overs to take home, which are still good the next day.  The customer service is top notch. They are extremely nice and helpful. The prices are very affordable for the amount of food they give, perfect if you have a large party and are planning on taking care of the bill!   I've tried a few other dishes and appetizers, and I am never disappointed. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!",

    "text": "I'd give them 5 Stars but service can get slow when they are busy and they DO get busy some nights. Especially if they have a large party going on. The decor is cheap and lackluster too, but the food makes up for it. Lula Kebobs (chicken or Beef) always moist and delicious and portions are amazing for the price. Similar dish in most other places range from $14-$20 and doesn't come near the quality. Their Lula Kebob is a mere $9.99 and for that price it's incredible! The Borch Soup is amazing - a must try. Lamb chops are nice too. Stuffed Grape leaves (Sarma) are very good, as are the Babaganush, the Tabuleh and the roasted Vegetable salad. Stay away from the Chicken Kiev - it's not really chicken Kiev and it's awful. The Hummus tasted not quite authentic, but maybe it's because it's more of a Russian Armenian place...? I'm also not a fan of the very dry and thin Pita bread. It's semi OK when it comes out warm, but turns into cardboard within 2-3 minutes. Chicken Skewers are a bit dry, but nicely seasoned. A friend of ours hosted/catered  a huge dinner party there last year. They served so many specially made dishes (that are not on their regular menu) and so much food and alcohol. The service was amazing and attentive, each dish was perfectly made, and the cost (considering what we got for it) was the best catering deal one can imagine. Highly recommended for large parties if you don't mind the decor being a bit cheap and tacky.  The entertainment (live music) they have there is also on the painful side, but the Russians and Armenians seem to love it, so I guess it's a matter of opinion and culture. Another good thing about this place is they are consistent. You always get the same thing. No \"good day-bad day\" in that kitchen!",

Took a long time to order food when it came it was burned cook more than enough time to come over and assess the burnt food I was given some grief over it as well I was asked if I wanted another one and I said yes they left the burned one on the table apparently they were going to try to charge me for the burnt one too even though it was inedible. I have seen other reviews of rudeness here and there is definitely some work they could do on that this place could be a gold mine with great food with some small changes",

We were seated about 10 minutes with nobody coming to our table to even ask for our drink orders. There were 2 people busy setting tables, but later were at the front just talking and another 2 that were setting up the to-go containers and were also talking. There was a waiter just casually having a conversation with a customer at the next table for about 5 minutes. Who knows how long we would have waited if I didn't flag someone down. Come to realize that the waiter that was at the next table was our waiter as well. When he was told that we needed help, he looked embarrassed, but didn't offer any apology for the wait. So minus one star for the service.",

It's almost like they tried to be classy but forgot to hire interior designer.   Food sucked - Got chicken kabob and chicken lula. Kabob was OKish but lula looked like some kind of squishy  mass of unknown origin (not sure if it was even chicken to begin with). Tasted odd too. French fries were old like they were sitting in a tray for a while.   Service sucks - 5 waiters hanging out at the front talking to each other but we can't even get a water refill. Waitress took my card for payment and instead of proceeding to the register went on to engage in another conversation for almost 10 minutes... then realized that she had my card in her hands and decided to finally take care of business.   And don't get me started on \"Live Entertainment\". My wife wants the guy to perform at her funeral when the time comes (and if he is still alive by then).   Not going back... unless forced to.",

I can't make up my mind which lamb chops I like better, Shish Kabob's or Texas De Brazil's :(  The price did go up a couple of bucks, but that's okay for the quality of food you get.   Then they have all these delicious appetizers  that explode in your mouth with lots of flavors! The hummus, babaganoush, and eggplant caviar...I'm done! I can eat those as a meal and have a food coma for the night!   Tonight I ordered the gyro meal that came with choice of rice or fries or you can get both. The meal came with healthy veggies on the side. I love how they provide a side of tzatziki sauce in a gravy boat saucer so you can control the amount you desire. The food here is consistently delicious and service is superb! You earned my five stars!",

The rice is different. Which is terrible because it was delicious before.We ordered a gyro plate and there's almost no meat in it. What was there was sliced extremely thin and so dry that  when you bent it, it cracked.  We got chicken fingers for my son which were plain and they were almost black they were so over cooked. Chicken Lula and kebab were good I'll give them that. But we were so so disappointed. We won't be back.",

Salad was full of fresh and perfectly ripe veggies, perfectly flavored, and a great accompaniment to the mix of meats in the plate: two small lamb chops, two pieces of lamb kabob, two pieces of chicken kabob, and a skewer of beef koobideh (ground formed beef), served with roasted tomato and pepper. Tons of food, bill just under $25.  Wish I'd seen a menu, they really do need a website. Looking forward to coming again, service from Sophie (even to pick up an order) was great.",

First my Armenian salad was served along with the bread and my drinks. Like always I love it. Now I'm ready for the rest of the food. Beef kabobs with rice. Waiting , waiting and waiting. I noticed the waiter who helped me wasnt visible.  One table got their food before me. 2nd table got their food before me.I was there first before those 2 tables. 4 waitresses  in the floor and none of them bothered asking me if I needed help. I asked one of the waitresses , where is the waiter who helped me. She said he left for delivery. GREAT!  She asked me what did I order. So I told her and she went to register to get the order printed. Went back to my  table and showed me if that was I ordered.  So all these time my ordered was left in the registered and 4 waitresses has no clue about it. The communication of one waiter to another obviously didnt happened.  I'm so dissappointed how my order was being taken care off.  This place was used to be my favorite place to meet up friends for lunch and dinner. As of my experience today. I will not come back ever again. I ended up taking the rest of my food to go as I lost my appetite already waiting.",

Each meal also comes with a side of salad and a pita bread. I recommend their kabob. It is easily the better dish that they offer. For appetizer, try their cucumber yogurt dip, which has a very refreshing taste. Do avoid their cheese platter with fresh herbs. It's literally cuts of cheese served with stalks of fresh cilantros and dills for $8 LOL. Pricings are similar to other Mediterranean places in town with entrees starting at around $12. The restaurant is a good size with plenty of seatings and looks clean. Service is ok, depending on the server you get. The last time I was here, I did have to ask for water refills a couple times.",

As we entered the door three of them sounded like they where arguing so one of them told us to pick anywhere we can sit which was a first for us since they've always sit us before. So we picked a table and sat down. We waited about 10/15 min and no servers to bring us water or ask us what we would like to drink or start off with any appetizers.... another party walks in and they sure where helpful to them and sat them down rite away and took they're order... we where mad and felt it wasn't rite since we haven't gotten any service so we decided to get up and leave. When they saw that one of them screamed to come back but it was too late... really bad service and felt like we didn't belong in that restaurant with the way they did not attend us",

I planned it for months and had around 100 guests of which half were from other states & overseas.  I specifically mentioned i did not want the crap wine (yellowtail) which was included in the price. They said no problem and to just let them know which wine i wanted and it would be $2-3 bucks upcharge per person. I spoke to manager and told him which wine i wanted.  He said they can't charge me per person becsuse it's an \"expensive wine\" and it would be $50 per bottle. It's a $9 wine at any store!! So we settled for the next crappy option they had for a few bucks per person. We then also upgraded to whiskey and ended up paying an extra $10 per guest, but they excluded the cognac.  Um why??!!  They also said that they would stop serving us at 2:30, but we could stay as long as we wanted. At 2:22am, with absolutely no warning, they put the lights all the way up and started taking all the bottles off the tables. I was mortified the way they did it!  Almost $8000 and they basically told us to go *uck ourselves.   I asked them to please turn the lights down and the head waiter was so rude.  Not to mention the serbian waiter was complaining since 9am (was there early to decorate) that he was going to have an 16hr day. So glad my mom told him \"i worked 72hrs, get over it\".  It was so damn embarassing the way they treated us!!!  I was and still am upset!  The food was good, but would never recommend this place for a private party. I REGRET not going to the other armenian place on Sahara. I will make sure no one in my community has a party here again!",

We ordered the hummus appetizer and it was pretty good. I am not a fan of hummus, but was able to take this down with delight. I think that the hummus is made for about four or more to share. My husband and I were not able to finish it and had to take it home.  My husband thought that the meat was too salty. I found it to be just okay, but lacking in flavor for sure. Their rice was not as good and their veggies didn't have much flavor either. On a more positive note, the food did not make me sick or anything.  Overall, I don't think I would come back here personally. The service was good, but the food just doesn't cut it for me.",

The lay out is really nice for the price your paying I would of thought it was a hole in the wall. One of the employees shoes was beyond time to retire. I'm not sure why she was permitted to where such disgustingly dirty shoes. The mare sight of them made me lose my appetite. Again the lay out is really nice and everyone's was very nice. I think they may have thought I was a food blogger or something lol. My overall experience was great and I loved the food. The lamb chops where marinated in red wine for 2 days and where so juicy and dam near falling off the bone. The hummus was to die for. The portions were really nice they give you a really good amount of food for a little price. One particular waiter was beyond awesome, if you come in on Peter's shift consider yourself lucky he's awesome. Next time I will get the food to go tho.",

    "text": "We decided to have some kabobs on a hot Saturday night. I didn't know what to expect since I've never been here before. Apparently they used to be in a smaller place and have now moved to a bigger place. After looking at the menu, I decided on the combination plate. The combination plate included: 1. Beef Lula- this was tender and juicy 2. Beef Kabob- also tender/flavorful 3. Chicken Kabob- too dry to fully enjoy it 4. Porkchop- overcooked and a lil too grilled for my liking The rice was delicious, but I'm sure it had a lot of butter of salt. The salad was decent....a lot of onions, so if you plan on taking your significant other there, beware of onion breath! Overall, I though it was just ok and if I go back I will just stick to what I liked and possibly try this lamb kabob that all the other yelpers are talking about.",

The food is fantastic, and the prices are so reasonable for the amount of food provided!  We've since tried the sturgeon, beef and chicken kabobs, pork chops, and plenty of the appetizers, which are meals in themselves!  The main dining room is very nice as it is exactly that, a room.  No noise and clang of the kitchen to be seen or heard. The wait staff are friendly and courteous; our favorite is Greta.  Be warned, the entrees do take some time to come out from the kitchen, but you'll know every minute was worth it as the food is just incredible.  The food is different, but not so exotic that it is for adventurous eaters only. Can't wait to bring my family!",

That gave me 2 hours until I had to leave they said 45 min to an hour at 2:45 I called to see if it was out for delivery he said it was I had to leave for work at 3:30 and it still was not there in very disappointed although when I called they did offer me a discount if it showed up...

The dishes were all very good (except the lukewarm steak fries that came with the gyro) and the portions were huge.  Prices are very reasonable; in fact, I don't know how they can give you so much food for the $7 to $13 I paid for the dishes.

They have a beautiful private room that can fit up to 40 people. At the day of the party, we had a wonderful lady help us out the whole afternoon. She even helped put up the decorations and was always there refilling the food and drinks. When we walked in, the tables were beautifully decorated and appetizers were already out. The tabbouleh and eggplant were absolutely delicious. When our whole party arrived,she brought the food out. We had lamb kabobs, chicken luna, and chicken kabobs. All the meat was well marinated with flavor and cooked to perfection. We finished off with some fruit, ice cream and Armenian tea.",

No less than an hour into our wait, our waiter provided us with a convenient excuse of the kitchen encountering problems. Meanwhile, every other guest who entered before and after us, received their food many of whom ordered the same plates we did. I brought this to the attention of another staff member who rolled her eyes in response and walked away. After approximately 90 minutes, we did not receive our food and left. There are a myriad of disinterested employees who either stand around and watch the ceiling or wander aimlessly without course inattentively. It's beyond me how the restaurant operates in the manner it does. As an avid food critic, the word will be spread.",

    "text": "Three years of living in Vegas and passing by this place atleast a dozen times, thinking I've got to try this, well, today was the day. Assuming it is a \"Middle Eastern\" restaurant, the waitress proudly mentioned it is actually an  Armenian Restaurant, but most of the dishes are interpretations of popular  \"Mediterranean dishes\".  I stand corrected, seriously, I appreciate the correction.    Let's start from the beginning.  Waited to be seated about 2 minutes, but was graciously welcomed once acknowledged.  While waiting, I notice the decor was tasteful, simple, yet warm and the lighting soft, which distracted for the asbestos drop ceiling.  We were then seated and no one came back for atleast 10 minutes. I really wished someone would have dropped off atleast water and asked if we had any questions, but when the waitress came, her full attention was on us.   At first, I wish the menus were a bit more sophisticated than a two-sided laminated 8 x 11 page with low resolution pictures and prices...even the wine menu looked like more effort was spent on it, thought it was also a laminated page, just better paper.  However, given the price point of the food (bargain!), pleasant setting, and nice service when attention is on you, who really cares?  We ordered our alcoholic drinks and our main entrees.  The wine list has ordinary wines (Yellowtail, Columbia Two-Vines), but all so had a few wines from their homeland.  However, regrettable I ordered a Two-Vines Merlot instead of trying Areni (Sp?), a dry red wine from either Armenia or neighboring Georgia.  My husband initially ordered a beer listed on their menu, but no longer have, the waitress sweetly and proudly convinced my husband to try one of their Armenian beers, which he was pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste.  Wines are pleasant prices around $5 bucks, beers are even a bit less.  It took about 5 more minutes to receive our drinks and wine, and about 20 minutes to receive our food.  I took this as a good sign that the food was cooked to order, when ordered. I had the lamb chops.  The waitress happily obliged my request to substitute additional salad for rice or fries.  My husband ordered the Beef Lulu and beef kebab.  The food: Beyond expectations, it came out hot, freshly made/prepared as requested, and very, very tasty, especially given the price point.   Honestly, I have been at restaurants that have lamb chops on the menu which are half the portion at twice the price, and nothing was prepared as well as Shish Kebab House....even my husband devoured my other two chops as he constantly expressed that they didn't taste \"gamey\".  Thanks hun, for finishing off my lunch tomorrow.  (LOL)  I love the waitress' confidence and pride in the food she served.  She chuckled as she confirmed we were pleased with our dishes, since there was nothing left on our plates.  What she doesn't even know is that we weren't even \"hungry\" yet we \"managed\" to finish our food.    While service is a bit slow for my liking, the waitress was polite and there is no denying this is good food for a good value.  You will not be disappointed and you will be a fan too! I cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "Will visit again.  Good portion at a fair price, good quality meat, big menu variety.  The way their menu is set up (almost a la carte style), it's best to be ordering for a group of 4 or more, or planning to get multiple meals out of your order, if you a like a varied spread of dishes like I do.  Spice was pretty good on all the kabobs, although I wouldn't have minded a little more spice (but that is generally an issue for me with Mediterranean restaurants).  I particularly liked the Armenian Salad, and Hummus.  The grape leaves were flavorful, I hate when they're super bland, but slightly tough.",

But I've also tried other dishes and they all are just as delicious. Be prepared on a Saturday night you may have to wait a little, it is worth it. The staff is excellent and very courteous.",

I am in the same business and would never have people wait that long to get service. Shame on him that he doesn't address this problem with his employees!!! I will return as my kids love it but please work on the service!!! The 2 stars is for service and the food is always 4 to 5 star !!",
