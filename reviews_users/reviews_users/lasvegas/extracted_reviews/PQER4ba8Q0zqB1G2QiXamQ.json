Now...the restaurant was busy, but you should never be THAT busy that someone can't come over and offer water.  I left.  I went back one night with my best friend.  Neither of us felt like cooking, so we stopped in.  Again, we were seated right away, and waited for about 10 minutes before we were given water and had our orders taken.  We almost left again.  10 minutes is too long to wait, even in a busy restaurant.   The chili was good.  That was really the only stellar part of my meal.  I ordered a burger, and I honestly could have cooked a better one at home.    For having mediocre food, and LOUSY service, I don't think that I will EVER go back again.",

We had to wait about 15 minutes, but it was well worth the wait.  The server was great!  She was very attentive and kept the coffee coming!  We asked for extra gravy, for these amazing, fresh, fluffy and huge biscuits and she made sure we had enough!    The second and third time we visited the diner, we had different servers, each of which forgot part of our orders, seemed uninterested and rushed to give us our checks, like they had something pressing to do.  The funny thing is that the restaurant was more than half empty on the other two occasions.  These days were on a Thursday evening and a Friday afternoon consecutively.  The worst part of these last two visits is that the biscuits were stale and hard and the gravy tasted old and had too much pepper.  Big Disappointment!  Because of the last two visits, I can only give the diner a three overall.  I'm unsure if I will even go back at this point.  Too bad because it's a really cute concept for a diner with all of the wood carved and stuffed bears everywhere and the homey feeling it portrays.",

Location is convenient. Easy drive on the way home after work. Plenty of parking spot!  We are only eating breakfast here, so I don't know how their other food items. (We ate dinner once in Reno! It was horrible!) Anyway, we had really bad and really good experiences in this location at breakfast time! It depends who is the cook, food can be very good or very mediocre! I would never eat their Steak and eggs! Somehow they can not make it right. Eventually they are taking it off from the bill, trying to makeup for the mistake. My point is that I don't want free food! I would like to eat a good meal after working 12 hours in my job! We told them that, so we were getting somewhat better food lately. I found the Classic Eggs Benedict very tasty. I like it with country potatoes. Their hash browns are not cooked well enough! My friend always orders different things with more or less luck! I think their fresh orange juice is over priced, still order it since I don't drink soda!",

My husband could not resist ordering a meal of ribs with shrimp, kielbasa, salad and mixed zucchini. I had a nice tuna melt and cole slaw. We shared an apple crumble a la mode.  While having dessert we overheard Marlene greet an 80-ish year old gentleman. By the time he made it to the table she had water waiting for him and was greeting him as he seems to be a regular.

That being said, if you're not allergic to wheat, GET THE BISCUIT!  The seedless blackberry jam on that huge house-made biscuit is TO DIE FOR.

I agree with the other reviews about the bears being a little weird but it gives it a homey feel to it. Great place for a family breakfast on Sundays or Holidays.",

The largest reason we Love this place is our waitress Marlene.  She makes everyone that walks in the door feel like an old friend.  The service she provides to her guests is above and beyond.  We were not sure that we wanted to stay in Vegas and had gone back and forth for a long time.  During one of our many visits to Black Bear Marlene just gave us her regular level of attention, recommendations, honest input on the delicious menu items and impeccable service.  But, for some reason, she made our experience so comfortable that on our way home, I expressed to my husband that Vegas really feels like home to me...\"Thanks Marlene!!  We are Staying.\"",

    "text": "It's rare that I take the time to write a review, much less a negative one; but I could not allow such a horrible dining experience to go unreported. I, much like many others, look to online reviews when making the decision to visit an establishment for the first time. This has been a pretty reliable practice until now. The negative comments were few, but I definitely should have taken heed to them even though they were drowned out by the many positive reviews. I only wish that my family's experience were even the slightest bit similar to those that felt compelled to sing this restaurant's praises. Perhaps your personal experience is dependent upon the cook and wait staff on duty at the time of your visit... In any event, as a first time patron to the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, I will never return. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately, that's where the positives end. Shortly after ordering our drinks, a very persistent fly or two buzzing around our table and our shooing them away seemed to go unnoticed by staff; this was my first opportunity to cut our loses and leave. Instead and regrettably, I ordered the Grizz breakfast, and my wife and youngest son the Spaghetti & Meatballs. In short, they were flavorless, cold and disgusting. My other son and daughter ordered the Western BBQ burger and Chicken Strips, fortunately theirs although nothing to write home about, were edible. The spaghetti and Grizz on the other hand were irritatingly horrible. The spaghetti looked and tasted as if someone poured ketchup over 4-day-old pasta and 2 day old, half-hazardly formed meatballs. Regarding the Grizz, the eggs were cold, flavorless and watery, which its still a mystery how someone can cook watery eggs; the meats were cold and salty and the hash browns were cold, undercooked and flavorless. The Pancakes were edible, until a fly landed on the plate.  I called the manager (Don) over shortly after receiving our food and he seemed utterly shocked that we were not happy with our order, stating, \"we are one of the highest rated restaurants in the city\". I found his defensive statement odd and completely detached from the fact that there were major issues with our order. He did however; eventually express his apologies and a desire to make things right by having something else prepared. Unless there was another cook to prepare it, I had no faith that it would be any different from our first order and declined. The waitress (Chrissy) came over to our table as the manager was there and asked if we needed anything. The manager mentioned to her that we were not happy with our meal and she gave us a look that made no effort to hide her irritation and walked away... That and the fact that the manager made no comment about her disrespectful actions was unbelievable and topped off what was already a horrible experience! The manager adjusted our bill; we paid and left completely feeling as if we just walked out of an episode of the twilight zone. I will never return, and to those that read this review and still take a chance with the Black Bear Diner on Tropicana, good luck",

Just try to avoid popular post-church service times, or you will wait!  The is consistently good and so is the coffee. The service can be inconsistent at times, but is generally really good too. It's a clean restaurant and a fun place to go. They're great with children and their kids' plates tend to be a lot - but better than too little!  It's worth the trip from almost anywhere (except maybe the far northeast or east near Nellis).   In terms of seating, just be aware that if you get sat in the side room (off to the right when looking in the restaurant), the last booth on the left (walking toward the kitchen) is not bad, but the A/C blows right on you.

I am going to speculate that it was the manager or owner because he was wearing a white shirt, but this gentleman was walking around the restaurant asking the customers if everything was good and everytime someone would come in the door. He would yell out \"Welcome\" and thank everyone as they would leave.  He was truly getting it out there how happy he was about his customers.   He was also at the cash registers when the servers were too tied up. It was great teamwork.   I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast. Wow! Lots of sugar on this..and usually I have a sweet tooth but way to early for this lol. It was really good though. I ordered some Sausage Links with the ordered but I didn't like the meat to much. I finished my whole plate though and I would love to go back to try something else :)  As you exit, on the door has the yelp logo, so wear it proud Black Bear Diner. Well deserved!",

For breakfast, Stephen and I have found many hidden gems located no more than 10-15 minutes from the Strip.  On this visit, I suggested coming to the Black Bear Diner located off Tropicana Avenue.  Black Bear is a restaurant chain that started in Mt. Shasta, California with locations in the western part of the United States, such as Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.  On weekends, they do get crowded, but fortunately we came on a weekday, and was seated right away at 9:30 am.  The restaurant is \"bear themed\" and the portions are lumberjack sized.  They do offer a a few menu items for seniors or those who are light eaters, and the portions are still very generous.  We had dinner plans at 7:00, so we didn't want to fill up with a huge breakfast.  We decided on the \"Mini Volcano\" which is 2 pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, plus an egg for $8.99.  The pancakes are made with a sweet cream, which I ate without syrup.  They reminded me of the taste of a fortune cookie, with a hint of vanilla.  Service was friendly, and there's plenty of free parking.",

The food was amazing it came out hot and fresh and the presentation was amazing. Not only was the food amazing but the staff made the experience. All the staff were friendly but the ones that stuck out the most were Raelynn, Mark, and Candace. They made me feel like i was at home and so friendly. We will definitely be coming back and hope to see all three of smiling faces.",

We've been in a few times to have a bite, but our last visit on 3/30 was an especially busy evening. Even though they seemed a bit short-handed, Marlene did a superb job attending to all her tables. She even accommodated my husband's request for \"sweeter\" sweet tea.   Bottomline: I highly recommend visiting THIS Black Bear Diner for a nice, affordable meal...and if possible, sit in Marlene's section.  Note: there is a Black Bear Diner within 3 miles of my house, but I pass it by to drive over twice the distance to this location because of Marlene :)",

Service is always wonderful and the portions are huge. My only disappointment was we brought a berry cobbler home. The crust looked flaky but was terrible!! They definitely need to do a better job with their pies and cobblers. Other than that I Wish there was a black bear diner in San Diego!!",

First off from the outside you would never think anything of this place...if you were just driving by it looks like a plain diner...BUT the minute you walk inside it has a warm woodsy homey type of feel! The decor is bear and woods themed! It's so adorable! It was very busy which is always a good sign! We were greeted very warmly when we checked in. The wait was only about 15 minutes.  We were seated by the manager Don who started the experience so positively! We had some friendly chit chat and he really does a fantastic job and making you feel VERY welcome!!  We were served by Anthony who did a fantastic job with our whole dining experience!! Also just so genuinely friendly!!  Now most importantly...the food. Let me just say breakfast is my absolute favorite and this place will NOT disappoint!! Everything about what everyone ordered was so on point and flippin' DELICIOUS!!! I had the Bear's Choice, in which I chose 2 scrambled eggs, 1 sweet cream waffle extra cripsy, bacon, and a side order of hash browns. Lawwwwwwwd have mercy it was the BEST tasting batter I have EVER eaten EVERRRR!! My hats off to the chefs in the back who our entire meal beyond perfect!!   I am so grateful I got a chance to eat here and I am so excited to eat there again!!!(Probably go back later today and tomorrow...lol) I told my friends if I could give a restaurant a hug they would totally get one from me!!  If you are in Las Vegas I HIGHLY recommend trying Black Bear Diner !!! If you love breakfast GO THERE!!!",

Thank you so much for the best request can't wait to come back and try some more off the menu. And I can't forget how welcoming and friendly he was, made us laugh and feel at home.

Don goes out of his way to greet every guest with a high-five or hug, and every child with a balloon.  He makes every visit fun and memorable.  It is because of Don that we return week after week and it is also why my family from out of town and I will be having Thanksgiving dinner there. We can't recommend Black Bear Diner enough.  If I had to find one flaw, I guess it would be when Don isn't there and another Manager covers for him.  The restaurant just doesn't run the same. I've met several of the other Managers and they don't have the same outgoing and fun personality that Don has.  If you're looking for a delicious family oriented restaurant, Black Bear Diner is a MUST!!!",

I was quickly seated and brought an iced tea while I perused the menu. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, all comfort style foods in large quantities.  I order a Bear special breakfast, which gives you several options. I had 2 eggs over easy, bacon, and a sweet cream waffle. The bacon is thick sliced and smoked, and very flavorful. The sweet cream waffle was light and fluffy, and delicious. One of the best I've ever had. Only thing lacking was the ice tea, a bit weak.  Service was fast and friendly. This is a great place for a decent breakfast. I need to try their chicken fried steak next.",

Today, the food was mostly delish and the service (finally) was mostly good, but here were the tradeoffs...first, when the hostess got our drinks, she brought me a LARGE fresh oj ($4.49) without even asking which size I wanted. I wouldnt have minded if a large wasnt so expensive, but having the choice should be expected.  Then we waited at least 10 minutes without any acknowledgement from a server until we grabbed another one who took over our table as a courtesy.  She brought our food out quickly but my hubby had ordered hash browns n she brought country potatoes instead. Also, the potatoes for both of us were undercooked. Then when we paid the hostess asked how everything was & gave me a crazy look when i told her we had no server till we stole someone else's. Then she underpaid my change by a few cents, which seems pretty hard to do with a cash register doing math for you, and a drawer full of coins.  Probably not going back  there anytime soon!",

We went here on a Saturday morning and it was packed full of people with a 25-30 minute wait.  It's one of those places that really should be in a cabin town like Mt. Charleston, but being in the heart of Las Vegas will do too.  Everything they make is HOMEMADE, not that artificial shit you see common in many of my other reviews.  I love homemade food because it's made with passion and ingredients that really give a True flavor.  Black Bear Dinner didn't miss the memo on that.  Although there wait times are extremely long and perhaps service could be better, the food killed it.  I had orange juice and I expected to be served Tropicana or Minute Maid equivalent orange juice and to my surprise it was actually fresh squeezed with REAL orange juice.  You just don't find that anywhere anymore!  My breakfast was French Toast with country smoked bacon.  Perfectly powdered with sugar and the bacon was nice a crisp and you could taste the smoke still from the grill...YUM!  My eggs were good too, the real deal.  I'm a big advocate of restaurants making food from scratch and Black Bear Dinner won't disappoint.  My only real squirm was the service from the servers, but the food outweighed the negligence.",

That while became a happy return for my fiancee and I recently where the food is still top notch!  Portions can often be big so it's best to ask the servers just how big the size of the plate of food is.  Biscuits and gravy are not just served on a small saucer, they're served on an elipse sized platter covered in gravy!  You WILL need to share some of these platters between two people!  Recently I had one of the most delicious sandwiches EVER!  The Gobbler, not to be confused by the Gobbler served at Farm Basket, is sliced roast turkey, avocado, mayo, tomato, and cranberry sauce on toast.  Oh my God! Was that a tasty sandwich!  I think it was almost as good as the Bobbie from Capriotti's!  It's really like having Thanksgiving on a sandwich!  Really attentive servers that always come around to bring you fresh beverages and they are quite knowledgeable with what comes with each platter so you don't get the whole \"I'll have to check the kitchen for you...\" or \"I'm not sure...I can ask for you...\"  I'm looking forward to going back more and more to Black Bear Diner as it's definitely the place to go for comfort food favorites!  The only thing I wish, is that they were open 24/7.  The diner reminds me a lot of a diner my family and I used to frequent back east in Wilmington, Delaware called The Golden Castle.  The restaurant really seems perfect for 24/7 business!",

All of the dishes have a made by Grandma Kitchens taste.  Every dish I have tried has been delicious.  The Pot Roast is so tender and amazing with the taters, veggies, and yummy gravy.  Breakfast dishes are also very delicious. I absolutely love Omelettes and they have some tasty combos. Pancakes are also solid with thick and crispy bacon.  Oh man I think I am waking up from my food coma and ready to go for another round at Black Bear Diner.  This is a must try place in Las Vegas.",

Pancakes ,French Toast, Eggs, Bacon and Sausage Patties = mmmmmm Good. Also their Hambugers get a 5 star rating from me. There also about 500 or so Teddy Bears on the shelves. No I am Not kidding !  I would also recommend their Fresh Baked Pies. It is packed most of the time, but it is well worth the wait.",

    "text": "On a recent trip I was able to go to two of these places 3 times.  This stop was pretty much like all the others. Chris the morning manager the day I went, was really on top of service, he got us seated right away, continually walked the floor and made sure people were taken care of and just overall assisting wherever needed.  Our waitress on the other hand could have been more involved.  She took our order and was barely around and was a little gruff when I asked about the selection of hot sauce and that whatever was on the table was all they had (which my other visits demonstrated there were still only proprietary sauces but there were a couple of choices).  Chris ended up getting a refill on my coffee and made sure we had the rest of what we needed, the only other time the waitress stopped by was to deliver the check.  For this location, I tried the California Benedict.  It was pretty good, the hollandaise worked well with the bacon and rest of the ingredients.  In future visits that will be a selection I try again.  Otherwise it was a quick in/quick out visit, but had Chris not closed the gap I would have ringed another star.",

    "text": "I would TOTALLY come back. This place reminds me of grandma's log cabin in Mammoth with the Bear theme, carved bear statues, and a variation of bear decor like stuffed bears, and other bear-y memorabilia. You're either into bears, or you're not, which, I am. ANYWAYS. We called ahead on Monday morning for a party of eight, which they accepted and gave us a wait time of 15 minutes. Super friendly, prompt, and polite service upon arrival.   Food: Everyone HAS to try the California Bacon - Black Bear Benedict.  I got this with my \"extra crispy\" hash browns and side of fruit. The poached egg was sliiiightly too cooked for my preference, but the Hollandaise sauce tasted AMAZING! Like, I'd go there and re-order it  type of amazing. And, although I didn't order it, my friends got some kind of Breakfast scramble that came with biscuit and gravies and that looked equally as delish. Oh, and, the portions are pretty hefty.   Come here if you're in the mood for comfort food breakfast stuffs and want to avoid the long insane wait times at Hash House. My coffee cup was never empty and the food arrived in all its perfection.   YUM.",

Great family restaurant and what a cool atmosphere! all the bears! Kids love to look at all the different bears, The staff is always helpful, friendly and quick to get you anything you need and they look happy , unlike some waitresses at other restaurants in this town.

They have another type, almond granola that I'm anxious to try the next time I'm there. The waitress we had was enthusiastic, friendly and talkative and you could tell she loves what she does. My husband had the turkey dinner and it was also delish. The decor is a bit strange with stuffed bears everwhere but oddly endearing. Can't wait to go back to this restaurant!

Our waitress Elizabeth was awesomely  cute with the most adorable pair of eyeglass frames, and arrived at our table covered in some of the delicious delicacies that we were about to  partake.  Her arm was covered in butter and it looked like she had been working seriously hard during the morning rush. Never-the-less that busy morning did not put a  damper on her spirit or attitude. She was still amazingly friendly, patient, heartwarming, and knowledgeable.  Oh, the food is good too, the portions are generous, and the pancakes are the best in the entire state of Nevada, crispy on the inside and moist and creamy on the inside. We were also allowed to substitute items on the menu. In my ginormous breakfast I had  bacon and both types of sausage instead of the ham. One can get ham steak anywhere; but how often does one get to try in house made patty sausage ........deeeeeeelicious!  If you go try to get Ol' Butter Arm Elizabeth for your waitress the food is good, but her smile and attitude make it great!",

'black bear diner' popped up on yelp. because it had bear in its name, i said hell yes!  anyhow, this place looks like it came out of some ski/snow resort up in tahoe. awesome and pretty at the same time. i think their theme is \"goldie locks and the three bears\". they had a lot of wooden bear statues - perfect for photo opportunities. did you know that black bears can practically run up trees? crazy.  the yelp reviews raved about the pancakes. unfortunately, i'm not a pancake fan. maybe i just haven't had any decent ones growing up. so we all stuck mostly to the typical breakfast food - omelets. i mean, if you mess up eggs, you're not really much of a diner. i got the california omelet and boy these yelpers sure weren't kidding about the portions. it was LOADED with avocado and mushrooms, inside AND on top. i've been trying to avoid those buffets in vegas because of the quantity - this was equally as bad.   the actual omelet lacked flavor, so i had to play with the salt a bit. the amount of avocado, bacon, and mushrooms made up for it. the biscuit, though large and house made, was rather flavorless without the butter + honey. the only constant that you can't go wrong with are the potatoes. i chose the red potatoes over the hash brown because it had a little bit of green - bell peppers.   4 stars - 3.5 for the food - extra .5 for the decor.",

That is the best way to describe the HUGE almond granola pancakes I had for breakfast (I ordered mine with no powdered sugar or butter and barely used any syrup - the standalone flavor was excellent) I couldn't finish more than 1 pancake (and they were just as good later and a snack, room temperature!)  My husband had the Volcano breakfast with the sweet cream pancakes. I was less impressed with that version of the pancakes, tasted more like a plain muffin to me, but he enjoyed them just fine.  It was SUPER busy, even on a Thursday late morning, so it seems others enjoy the rest of the menu too. There was a good mix of locals and travelers in house, which is a positive in my opinion.",

I was greeted so warmly by Anthony, who showed me to my table and explained the menu to me since I mentioned this was my first visit. What a great menu too. Large and small choices and an amusing civer on the menu featuring 1962 themed fun facts and articles. How unique! That is all I had to say. Anthony's bubbly personality and charm just really impressed me. He even told me that they would be happy to offer me aome other veggie choices, not expressly on the menu.  My turkey, garlic mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and coleslaw even were presented very appealing and were delucious. Anthony checked on me numerous times and was just a pleasure.I asked to speak to the manager, I believe in acknowledging good employees.  Too many people are quick to point out the bad ones.While I was waiting,  I noticed a waitress walking by with a big smile. It turned out to be the supervisor, Marlene. She came by to ask me how everything was going and I told her how impressed I was with Anthony's service and attitude. She was very aware of how awesome he was. What a doll she was. Her face lit up as ahe told me how much she loved welcoming new guests and her job.  She got me a form to fill out to sign up for e-mails and offered to give me a free desert. These people know how to give great customer service. Next the manager Trinidad came by and sat down with me. He was fabulous too. He told me how he loved working for this company. He praised his staff also. He told me how they all loved to get to know their customers and hoped I would return. What a great, warm place with delicious food, good prices, great value and a real family feel to it. In this town, that is very rare. I can't wait to return and order something from the all day breakfast choices. Sooo many restaurants and their staff could lessons from this place! I feel like I found a diamond in the desert.",

If I have to recommend one thing to eat/drink, it has to be the Huckleberry ice cream! This is the only place in town that has Huckleberry ice cream and also does fantastic ice cream shakes. It takes just like the huckleberry products that I have come from Idaho. If you come here, you have to try something with Huckleberry in one form or another.",

The French toast was made out of a bear claw pastry and then battered and fried, it was disgusting and not what I was expecting.   The bacon was the driest piece of bacon I've ever had my life.

    "text": "My husband and I went there for the first time on a Wednesday night about 7pm and there was no waiting time. We approached the front counter and there was a girl with one elbow propped up on the counter behind her and she said hi and I said there were 2 of us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table, and I replied we would like a booth. She proceeded to take 2 folded newpapers (which, upon our own investigation, we found to be the menus on the inside) and walk towards the first booth. She didn't mention we should follow her, but I figured we should when she went to the closest booth. She somewhat tossed the menus on the table and asked what we wanted to drink and said our waitress would be there shortly. Needless to say, our first impression of the restaurant was awkward, and we almost felt like we were intruding on them. Meeting our waitress wasn't much more pleasant. I honestly don't remember her name, but I would request, if we were to visit again, to not sit in her section. Here's the thing, I'm under the impression that if you want to make good money as a service person, you should be very pleasant. Our waitress was just nice enough to warrant a tip, but she was not very friendly or cheery. My husband and I are neither one hard to please in the least and we both were unhappy with the service. Every time I said thank you for whatever she was giving us, there was absolutely NO reply. Nothing. Some sort of acknowledgement would be nice that I spoke to you.  Now, on to the food. The sweet tea was great, and this is a hard thing to get an approval for from 2 southerners from Texas. My husband ordered the CFS with fries and green beans. The CFS was pretty good and the gravy was good. The fries were also good. The green beans were WAY overpowered by the onions in them. That's all you could taste, pretty much. I ordered the Mikey's chicken pot pie. It was pretty tasty, however, I wish it had been mentioned in the description of the contents that there were mushrooms in it. I don't care for mushrooms, so I dug through the pie to remove them, then enjoyed the rest of it. The crust and creaminess were great. We both started with salads, and those were good, too. My husband ordered the lava cake for dessert, and I had a few bites. It was also pretty good.   At the end of the dinner, we went to the front counter, and again, was very briefly asked, by the same girl as before, how we liked it, and we replied that it was good. She took my credit card for payment and, instead of handing it back to me at the lower part of the counter, she placed it on the top counter (almost at eye level), handed me a pen and 2 slips from my transaction, and turned and walked away. Really?!?  There was no \"Thank you\" \"Get lost\" or even a word after. Again, my husband and I just felt like an inconvenience to them. This whole experience was just awkward and we felt unwelcome for sure. I wish we had been on the other side of the restaurant where the only cheery and happy and laughing waitress was. I saw no one else that worked there smile. Not even once. Our waitress barely broke a grin, for goodness sake!  Overall, I liked the food way more than the service, and that isn't saying much. There is supposed to be a new location opening in Henderson this fall. We will probably go eat breakfast at that location, but I don't think we will return to this location probably ever.  If I could have given this place a 1 1/2 stars, I would have. It's too bad since I really have been wanting to take my husband there for the sole purpose of him getting his beloved CFS (it's really hard to find a great southern style one to compare to back home in Texas). He was happy to get a pretty good one, but the experience was tainted by the unwelcome attitudes and faces we encountered. What a disappointment.  :/",

We've been wanting to try this place out because of their breakfast specials. After a 5 mile morning hike to burn off some calories, we decided to finally hit the BBD for some good eats.  My hubby and I went with a bunch of pals. It was hit or miss whether the food was good.  My hubby enjoyed his ribs and fries - a very large portion size. The ribs were fall off the bone and layered with a good amount of BBQ sauce. They weren't the best ribs ever but they were good for the price. The corn muffin was not good due to the fact that it was stone cold. My hubby said that my corn muffins are better regardless... and I make mine from a box (Trader Joe's, baby), LOL!  I ordered their famous 7 almond granola pancakes ($6.99) which were alright. They are a rather large size (not Hash House a Go-Go size, but big enough). The flavours  were okay but the main issue was texture. They didn't have quite the fluffiness on the inside due to the amount of granola. Nor did they have the nice crispness on the outside either.  Our waitress was fine for a diner setting. She split our checks without a problem and was okay with the refills.  Overall, considering the service, food and value - this place rates a 3 star review.",

The quality of food is good and I enjoy that their hashbrowns and potatoes are not pre-frozen and are all prepared there to order. So far all the food I have tried I enjoyed.  I wanted to give 4 stars but the last two times that I have gone the service has been less than stellar with a really unorganized front of house. The host who seats does not pay attention to which groups come in first and seats them randomly which gets annoying when you have been waiting about 5-10 min just to be greeted.",

Our waitress was slow at getting to our orders, in a place that is usually full  there were at best 20 customers.  Three of use got our food 40 minutes after we placed our orders.  I and one other didn't get our food till 50 minutes later, we had to ask for to go box to return to work.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger with fries. It does not take 50 minutes to make a bacon cheese burger.  When I asked our waitress what happened she quickly blamed the cooks in a restaurant the was not busy. She did not offer any apology, smile, or anything. Very cold and indifferent. The ticket showed that she placed the order at 12:43, about 40 minutes after we ordered?!? What the flip!  She flat out screwed up and then blames the chief.  While we were talking to the manager, he takes a phone call. Expecting him to ask the person on the phone to hold, he doesn't! He starts a conversation with the person on the phone leaving standing there.  WOW! That was rude.  When he was finished his attitude seemed a bit put off.  We explained what happened, he apologized and offered to not charge or give us a free pie, but he had to go.  He said he would remember us later and make good on the offer.  Doubt he will remember us.  I may give this location another try because I have had nothing but good experiences in the past. Yet I wonder since the place was almost empty and other customers were having the same issue, yes we talked to a couple of other tables, that they have an employee training issue.  Bad customer service, good food.",

But, the last two times I have came here the service is sub-par and the food has not been good at all. The food is cold and today the potatoes were burnt to hell. I am not that hard of a person to please but common sense goes a long way. If you burn the food do not serve it to your customers! Very disappointed in one of my favorites restaurants in Las Vegas.",

The chicken pot pie is new and improved and very good, before it was weird so happy for this change. Chicken fried steak is on point, real good green beans, and turkey dinner.   Why not a 5 star? Could be more consistent. Service is usually pretty good but the employees should work together more and be quicker to refill and check-in, remove plates. Keep improving the menu and service and I'll likely update to 5.  I'll be back for sure.",

I met a business contact here for breakfast  and the place was big and services was wonderful.  I ordered the following:  Corned Beef and Hash ($10): it came with a side of \"fresh watermelon\", two over easy eggs and a biscuit.  The Corned Beef was not from a can but it overcooked where the meat was crunchy and hard.  The fresh watermelon was not fresh, it looked like it was sitting in a serving container.  The biscuit was OK and the over easy eggs were good.   Polish Sausage Link ($4.50): The polish sausage had no flavor and it was super greasy.  There are other better breakfast places in Las Vegas so I will go there first before I go back to Black Bear Diner.",

I ordered the California Benedict minus the spinach. The Hollandsise sauce was the best I have had in a long time ( and I order Eggs Benedict every where) the home potatoes were great and the fresh fruit was fresh! My fiance had the Denver Omelette and judging by how fast he inhaled it, i would have to say he enjoyed it as much I I enjoyed my breakfast. It was servered with an extremely large homemade biscuit, that we ended up taking back to California with us! They have their own hot sauces and my fiance really liked the habanero one. He likes extremely hot sauces and said this one was really good and flavorful without being so hot that you can't enjoy what you are eating!  Needless to say we will be back next time we are in Vegas!!!",

Server was attentive snapped a few pictures of us after we ordered and it came out the way we ordered it. So it was very nice. They made sure we had a good experience. Soup was hot and very creamy.

It comes with fruit which is great as it is a heavy meal and large portions.  I also tried their orange juice and it is fresh squeezed and delicious.  If you are hungry and looking for just a great diner to go to, I highly recommend this place!  Service was also impeccable.",

    "text": "The food quantity here is very good and you get your money's worth. I ordered the Southern Scramble and was not impressed. This basically consisted of Black Bear biscuits covered with sausage, restaurant egg product and packaged gravy mix. I remember thinking I have the same package gravy mix in my pantry right now, hmm? If they would of added some customization to the gravy mix it would of tasted....special. The best part of my meal was the fresh squeezed orange juice. I think I could actually taste the orange zest from the rind in the juice. Maybe not but it tasted fresh. I also had coffee which was super strong. A little too strong for my liking. I had to put 3 creams and 5 packets of sugar and it was still too strong and it was only an 8 ounce cup.  I had been to the Black Bear in Reno earlier this year and had exceptional customer service and a better breakfast. I had ordered a chili cheese omelet and was hoping to order the same thing with this visit. I suppose some menu items are regional or mangers choice. I will probably not be coming back to Black Bear as its far from my house.",

As 30mins passed they called the person who came in right before me so I obviously knew i was next. Then they seated a part of 1 which I wasn't mad about. Then they seated 2 party of 2's and a party of 3, completely skipping us. The person who was seating people was the manager. I asked him kindly why did i get skipped and he said \"i called that name a long time ago and nobody showed up.\" Mind you, me and my friend were stand right in front of the check in area the ENTIRE TIME! So i told the manager that and he insisted he called us. So me and my friend looked at each other and was like ok screw it. The manager seats us and asked for our drinks, i asked for a orange juice and quick he says \"we have none.\"  I dint know if he did it in spite because i know they do sometimes but i was real disappointed with the service. I usually love black bear and that location, but i was upset about how the manager handled things, really unprofessional.",

If Denny's had a richer and higher class relative this is it in terms of food quality.  The atmosphere is very \"homely\" and comfortable.  This is a good spot to also take the kiddos with the various bear designs and stuffed animals on the wall.  I was a bit thrown off when the hostess gave me a newspaper designed to look like an old read.  When I opened it, it was the menu to the place.  There are a lot options to eat.  I was hankering for a steak and eggs meal.  My server, a cute little flower named \"Flower\" was very friendly.  She gave me the heads up for two options with steak and eggs.  There was a New York steak version (10 oz) and a Rib Eye steak (more expensive).  I decided on the New York steak with over easy eggs, a biscuit, and country potatoes.  The meal itself was rich in portion size.  The chef gets the compliments for seasoning the steak perfectly and cooking it to the medium level I was asking for.  It was juicy and fantastic.  Everything else that came with the steak was also very very good.  I was so full after eating here I had to go run a few miles at the hotel gym to not feel like a sloth.  The service and food here was great.  I'd come back for another trek.  This is a few miles off the strip so you are gonna need to drive, Uber, or taxi it.",

If you're looking for a hang over brunch, Black Bear is worth a trip off of the strip.  We had the chicken fried steak (normal sized), which was covered in a reasonable white gravy.  Not the best I have ever had, but wasn't too bad either. Not overly greasy, and still had good crunch on the crust.  Also had the burger with nacho cheese and tortilla strips.  I know, disgusting.  But we were hung over and it actually tasted pretty good.  Burger was hand pressed and not overly dry, and the cheese and tortillas provided a great creamy/crunchy texture contrast.",

While most of the food isn't spectacular or anything, everything is usually pretty good and there are some real gems in there and you get a good value for your money.  What stands out to us is the customer service is always excellent.  The servers are very friendly and professional, the place is usually very clean, and the service is fast for a diner.   They are great with our 3 year old, who loves the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!    I recommend the Chicken Fried Steak and almost always have a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup.    The best part however, is the Cherry Creme Pie!    Save room or take one home.",

They have an assortment of foods anything from your normal eggs,sausage,pancake breakfast platter, to one of their best sellers their homemade meatloaf. If you are in the mood for food to lift your spirits but not worried about calorie counting this is the restaurant for you! Great portions, good quality, and very very affordable! What more could you want?!        I got The Bizz; 3 eggs, 2 sweet cream pancakes, 2 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon and hash-browns. It was exactly how I imagined and the pancakes were some of the best I ever had. I have never been big on pancakes but I fell in love with these they were fluffy and being made with sweet cream gave them this hint of sweetness. The only thing that could have been better were the hash-browns. They weren't your normally shredded  potatoes they were more like flat noodles that had been cut up and fried. The outside of the hash-browns were very crispy and the inside really soggy....were not really seasoned so they left much to the imagination. I think I will choose the country potatoes instead next time.        My boyfriend got the country fried steak. Never been a fan of country fried anything because it is normally very very salty. This on the other hand was pretty good. My boyfriend being a country boy raised on this stuff said it was very very good.         Last but not least no matter how full you are you must take home or try one of their home baked goods. I have always gotten their cobblers and they have never failed me. Crust and fruit filling are always the perfect combination and the crust especially flaky and buttery. This time around I tried the strawberry cream pie with cookie crust yum yum. I think I would like their banana cream or even coconut cream pie better. But def must try! I will continue to come here time and time again. The only thing missing that would make this restaurant that much better would be grits! Please get some grits in!",

Every layer of the dish was snapping with flavor and freshness.  It came with sides of hash browns and fresh fruit, and they were both excellent too.  The only part of the meal that wasn't top notch was the coffee, which tasted the way you'd expect diner coffee to taste.    The ambiance reminded me a bit of a mountain lodge that is a favorite of ours.  Representations of black bears are all around, from the wood carvings out front to the wallpaper.  The service was also top notch - quick and friendly.  In short, it was a most satisfying meal.  We will be going back for lunch soon.",

Had the granola cakes, eggs and ham slice.  Generous portions and good overall quality.  Outstanding or amazing???  Not really.  Cakes were a bit heavy and still doughy inside.  Probably tough to pull off with them being that dense, but I would have like a bit more done inside. Wait staff and owner was attentive (he checked on us during the meal).

We were less than pleased. My eggs and potatoes tasted like canola oil and my fruit bowl was subpar at very best, clearly not fresh. My sisters sandwich had little to no avocado and white American cheese instead of pepper jack. My dad, a big omelet lover, ordered a spinach, onion, and jalapeno omelet. What a disaster that was. Firstly, they do not have jalapenos despite the fact that I could throw a jar through the front door from the grocery store in the same parking lot. Then when the omelet arrived it was nothing more than a sheet of egg folded over with the onion and spinach sloped on top. No cheese, he hadn't asked for cheese because we were all under the impression that cheese came with omelets as a pretty main component of such a dish. We won't be back to black bear, disappointing since my dad really was a fan of this place for quite sometime.",

    "text": "When I visit an area I feel it my privilege to sample the local fare.  I pride myself on trying to support local business before resorting to chains but I feel it my civic duty to let the good folks that support this local establishment know that Blackbear Diner may perhaps be doing you a disservice.  I have a rating system that I only share in detail to those closest to my heart.  By such system this place is barely better than McDonald's. In terms of taste, this place easily has the edge over McDonald's.  It also has the advantage in terms of customer service, but no surprise there.   BTW Support Local Business, you'll still find individuals who care about how you feel about their business.    Ok, back to my review.  I ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast & side of Bacon.  I could just imagine those cinnamon rolls piping hot & crunchy slathered in butter, dripping with warm dark maple syrup.  What I got was room temperature,  soggy, fried cinnamon bread.  Imagine my disappointment when my little dream came crashing down into a sad, soggy reality.  I'm sure for most people the fact that these folks here are the creme de la creme of hospitality & service should make up for bad food.  I am here to enjoy my meal.  The staff did their job.  I certainly enjoyed the warm family type atmosphere!  Where this place fell flat for me, is the food.  So half of my experience was missing.  No matter who you are or where you are in life you know that if half of anything is missing it's incomplete.   What was an incomplete in school boys & girls? An F.  This place, as charming as it is, needs to do better.  My advice, fire the cook.",

We got our drink order right away and then were given our leisure to peruse the menu.  Lots of tempting choices so she had to check back with us a few times until we were ready.  Decisions.....  We ordered the chicken fried steak, and fish and chips.  The chicken  fried steak was crispy (almost too crispy) and flavorful and loaded with gravy.  The potatoes (red skinned mashed) couldn't have been better.  It came with grilled/steamed veggies done just right.    The fish and chips were moist and flavorful while crispy and not greasy.  The only complaint on the fish and chips was that while the portion served was big, the pieces themselves were smaller than we've had other places.  The french fries looked better than they tasted.  Not crispy enough for us.  We got pie to go.  The chocolate cream pie was a disappointment.  I don't know what they use for the chocolate filling, but it had an odd taste, almost like a cherry liquor maybe?  Anyway, didn't care for it.  For the price, would rather have gone for a Marie Callendar's and had a full pie.    Will we go back?  Yes, this place has good diner quality food.  The salads served at other tables looked pretty darn good and what looked to be chicken and biscuits at the next table is going to get us back there for sure.  Their meatloaf special and club sandwiches are on the list too.    Okay, for some real complaints.  There was a burnt on the grill smell in the air when we came in.  Maybe due to the openness of the kitchen to the dining area.  But a little unpleasant.  When we went to pick out our to go dessert and asked what was in the bear claw, the hostess was clueless.   Let us hope she was new.  One of the waitresses popped over however and helped us out.  Brown sugar and cinnamon or plain by the way.",

So, we sit down and literally, my hand gets stuck to the table.  When we call over a server to get a rag to clean the table, we are told that \"the breakfast crew must not have cleaned the tables\" so I guess they were disgusting during all of breakfast then the lunch shift as well as who ever was there before us for dinner?? Not buying it.  I tried the chicken fried steak as everyone seems to recommend it and I will say that who ever thinks this is the best they've ever had, have you ever been any where else??  I am very sorry but the gravy was a basic mix with no flavor AT ALL other than a pound of salt.  My husband had the Tri-tip dinner, all four little pieces of it for a whopping $17, and it had absolutely been microwaved as it was HORRIBLE!  No one ever came back to see if we were ok, until the end when our server came back with the check.  We told her that this was our first and would be our last time in.  She said she was sorry and we told her it was not her fault, just who ever was cooking in the back.  Sorry folks, I am starting to wonder if anyone has taste buds in this city as cannot even believe you would recommend this place!  I am sure I will need 100 bottles of water just to wash down the salt consumed.",

You can set aside the menu, not even look at it, and just order what you want and they probably have it. Cooked clean and garnished nicely. What's not to like? I wish we had one in NYC. I've also been to another Black Bear in Silicon Valley and loved that one too.",

A buddy of mine met up with me here for dinner a few nights ago and we were both in the mood for breakfast (+1 for ALL DAY BREAKFAST!) I had to laugh as we didn't realize that the small newspaper that was put on the table actually was the menu! The waitress came to take our order and we asked for menus. She looked at us kind of funny and laughed. Honest mistake! lol Anyway, my food was decent. I ordered the Volcano (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage) and my buddy ordered some dish with eggs, home potatoes, Portuguese sausage and a biscuit. His food came out warm at best and his potatoes seemed a bit overcooked and lacking flavor. My pancakes were good, eggs were eggs, the sausage was eh and the bacon was terribly overcooked and dry. The decor is fun, cheesy and could possibly be a bit frightening if you are not a fan of bears or stuffed animals. All in all, not a horrible experience and seeing as it serves breakfast all day and it's right around the corner I will probably be here more than a few times. Hopefully other menu items are better and I'll update my review from there.",

So we call the diner and lo and behold, the Diner has my keys.

In strong first position is Baby Stacks= however, if you are in the area and there is a Black Bear Diner close by- by all means stop. I always select an omelet from the healthy side, you will not be disappointed. Made with egg whites, crisp fresh filling of bell pepper, onion, tomato. spinach, what ever you desire. Fresh warm toast, pancakes, awesome crispy hot potatoes, ( I always have the home fries), delicious coffee, and they even include a lil fruit bowl. Yummy, fresh and friendly, my kind of place! Have never had anything but breakfast here so I cannot comment on other menu items, but have heard the pot roast is mouthwatering. Note: There will most often be a wait because this is one hot spot to eat- I try to keep in mind that the wait isn't the fault of the management- it is the folks who are enjoying those great dishes= soon my table will come, and I will side into my seat, place my order and slowly devour every succulent morsel.... yes you will wait, but it is worth it... so very worth it.",

So much so that we came back the next day for dinner before we left town.  The pot roast was delicious and we topped it off with their generous helping of Bread pudding for dessert.  The waitresses were very friendly and accommodating.  The meat loaf was the best I've ever had at any restaurant but not as good as the pot roast which I highly recommend.  I will certainly be back and check out their other locations throughout California.",

I tasted the hash browns and was pleasantly surprised because they were not greasy like many that you find. I also tasted his eggs and they were cooked perfectly - scrambled hard, just the way I like them.  Service was good as well. We did not wait to be seated or served. Our waitress was very nice and checked on us just the right amount of times. She also brought me a refill on my soda before I asked.   Overall, it was a great experience.

The manager is an older sweet greek man who will come by your table to make sure all is well with your meal. He is a doll. Love him..

Another thing that's homemade is their buttermilk biscuits and their fresh orange juice.   I tried the tri tip scramble which was meaty and delish! I'm a meat lover, and so I had to have meat as part of my five food group. The portions are huge and the scramble definitely had flavor thanks to the tri tip and the onions.   It is a mom and pop diner so if you're looking for a spot to check out some babes after a night out of town, this may not be the spot for you unless you're looking to snag a 65 year old retired cougar. RAWR. Senior Citizen Central! Also, eyes will wonder and whispers will lurk if you're looking like you had a horrible night out of town since it is also a family environment.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch this past weekend. The place has a real country/rustic feel to it with its fake wood columns and beams, wooden bear sculptures, and nature paintings. It's a cozy and comfy environment. The menus are kinda cool because they're designed like a newspaper with the food and drinks listed on the inside.  Come hungry because portions are big. I got the bacon bleu burger, a huge burger loaded with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and bleu cheese with a massive pile of fries taking up every available square inch of the rest of the plate. It was really tasty and more than I could eat. My kid got some apple cinnamon french toast, which was cut in thin strips. He enjoyed it but it was a little too soggy for me when I tried it (I always stuff myself silly when we go out to eat because I eat my food and usually his food that he doesn't finish). He also liked all the stuffed teddy bears lined along the walls.  Service was friendly, but after we got our food we didn't see our waitress again until we flagged her down to get the check. It would have been nice to get a  refill on drinks.  I thought this might be locally owned, but it's a franchise. One of 42 locations throughout the west coast, Arizona, and Colorado. It's a pretty good place to go for lunch and their breakfast items looked appetizing. It's definitely worth another few visits.   3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",

We brought our best friends here for the first time and they absolutely loved it too. The service is always great and friendly and the food is always fantastic and  consistently delicious. If you're craving breakfast I highly recommend the chicken fried steak it's probably the best my fiance and I have ever had & A great large portion.  I also tried their crispy chicken buffalo sandwich with coleslaw and pulled pork and that was pretty delicious too.  My friend had the pineapple pancakes and they very good.  If you're in Las Vegas and looking for a great place to eat whether it's breakfast lunch or dinner visit the Black bear diner you won't be disappointed.",

We have never had a issue it always hot and fresh the portions are huge but not to ridiculous that you can feed a small village but definetly enough for two.

I need a barrel of water and their pot roast has potatoes and carrots ..oh yassssss frozen can food nomzzzz LOLZ stop stop stop .. If you like their food here it's because of the breakfast isn't it?

    "text": "Having driven past this Black Bear diner a million times, I finally had the opportunity to stop in for breakfast. Pretty standard diner fare, with large portions, strong coffee, and brisk service. Previous reviews are correct- the coffee is pretty strong! Not undrinkable, but it definitely packs a punch.  I had the combo meal, which came with your choice of pancakes, French toast, or a waffle (I chose pancakes), eggs, and your choice of meat (I chose smoked sausage). The portions were definitely hearty! I really enjoyed the pancakes, they were filling, yet not too dense, and I intentionally only ate one, so I could have the other later. The sausage wasn't my favorite, but I couldn't figure out why. Eggs were fine and cooked to order.  Our server was pleasant and made sure to come around often to top off our coffee. We ended up with an extra glass of water, strangely, but no complaints. He did seem eager to get us out of there, which I didn't understand- the restaurant was busy for a Wednesday morning, but there was no wait.  Anyway, an overall fine experience at Black Bear Diner! If you're in the area and hungry, it's a good choice.",

But my husband mentioned this location (Tropicana) and he literally had to drag me here to try Black Bear again.  I am so glad we visited! Our waitress Dominica was friendly, lively and attentive.  I had the chicken caesar (delish) and my husband had the chicken tenders with fries. Every one of the chicken pieces were moist and tasty, and the fries were well seasoned. We had plenty of drink refills, too.  The biggest difference we saw at this Tropicana location that the Sahara location lacked was the real Black Bear vibe. We loved that vibe when we lived in the Portland OR area and was sad to leave it when we moved here. But now we found it again. Tropicana has the vibe for sure. The entire floor crew was playful and they had a real family-feeling attitude.   This is our new Black Bear. It's worth the longer drive and they'll be seeing us regularly! Thank you to the manager for running a great location and keeping your employees happy. It shows.",

This place is just cute from the carved wooden bears to the plush toys and newspaper menus but it's got two other things going for it: amazing staff (really) and huge portions (really)! The food quality doesn't suffer from the massive portions. Everything I've had tastes homemade and delicious. The menu also shows the calorie count, which is a nice touch.   The Turkey Dinner tastes like Thanksgiving at grandma's! The enormous biscuits are fantastic. The Chicken Fried Steak is my favorite and it also comes as a breakfast with eggs and hash browns. All the plates are garnished with watermelon - yummy! The NY Strip and Eggs was also surprisingly good quality for a breakfast cut. Another good dish is the Baked Trout. Definitely try the flaky Bear Claw pastries, which are enormous and baked in-house.   This is one of my favorite diners in Vegas. I give them 5 stars for the incredible staff, top quality food, and huge portions.",

The music they were playing was awesome it's a mix of oldies and Goldie's! The menu was on a newspaper and looked so real. I ordered the chicken and waffle meal and my boy ordered the grizzly . Both meals were a 10! The food was really so great here. The pancakes and waffles don't even need syrup because they are so sweet and fluffy. Chicken was light and very crispy, similar to katsu. The service was great and next time I am going to try the coconut cream pie! Can't wait to come back to the Black Bear DIner!",

Upon being seated by the Manager he brought my wife a cup of coffee that was so OLD and BLACK that THREE creamers did nothing to make the coffee drinkable.  Out waiter FINALLY arrived (only TWO servers for the WHOLE place) and went to get my wife some new coffee.  After being there about 20 minutes our server passed us by to take an order from a couple that arrived AFTER us.  This server was obviously new and whoever was supposed to \"train\" him was sadly lacking in training skills.  When our orders finally arrived there were NO FRIES with my sandwich.  I virtually asked the waiter WTF?  He said is did not come with fries.  My wife got a menu which emphatically stated the sandwich DID come with fries.  This was one of the WORST experiences I have EVER had at ANY restaurant.  Black Bear has DEFINITELY had a major loss of great service and quality since \"expanding\", probably in an effort to make more $$$$$.  A tremendous loss as this Black Bear location was always our \"go to\" place for great food and service.",

    "text": "Great diner! Friendly staff, spacious and the interior is awesome! We were seated fast in a booth. Menu that is extended yet not overwhelming. Plenty of healthy choices too, which I loved and I went for the healthiest plate on the menu: the Acapulco scramble. I replaced the toast with a hash brown. Scramble that was not over seasoned, most places have too much salt well here definitely not! That's great! Side of fruit. Good amount of hash brown. Great dish! My partner had the bears choice: eggs, sausage, French toast. He always takes this, it's his favorite. Their sauces and ketchup are non GMO and home made! We had a hard time resisting the pies and the front desk, maybe next time we should try one!:) Good value for good service and diner food. Will come back!",

The Eggs Benedict are insanely good and the orange juice is freshly squeezed and the hash browns are a must have. I've been there several times now and neither I nor any of my dining companions have ever had a single complaint and service has always been excellent. There can be a bit of a wait at times but it's well worth it. I've been wanting to try the mini-pies that are on display near the register but alas I've never had the room after downing the large portioned breakfast platters.",

She finally decides to greet us and I ask about one of the items. And says well it's a \"country fried steak\". That wasn't my question, and when she left my table she still went to talk to him, lol she has been standing there this whole time while I'm writing this. She needs to learn how to serve new guests and have alittle less attitude. Update he just left maybe we will get service now.",

My husband and I jumped in the car to visit the Black Bear Diner.  This restaurant is like the Black Bear version of Cracker Barrel.  The ambiance is filled with stuffed bears all along the top of the walls and a big bear totem-like structure in the middle of the restaurant. There is a gift shelf stocked with tshirts, loganberry syrup, etc. if you want to buy a souvenir.    The food is good and it is definitely a family restaurant. It's clean and the employees are very attentive.  Angela was our waitress and took her job duties very seriously.  I had my bear claw which could feed 2 people! The coffee was good but I like my coffee very strong which it wasn't. Hubby had chicken fried steak and eggs and was very happy with his breakfast.  I perused the rest of the menu and if you are vegetarian you won't have a problem with breakfast items. If you are vegan well there is only a seasonal fruit plate or salad. I really wish that this restaurant offered a vegetarian /vegan burger or even a vegetable platter.  The pies and cobblers in the front case looked exquisite.   There was a mango tea advertised which made an excellent mocktail. Black bear diner doesn't serve alcohol.   All in all we will visit again.",

Big Bear offers items on their \"A Little Less \" menu  During lunch break some co-workers and I were looking for a place that had something to offer everyone, and Black Bear fit the bill.  It's a homey atmosphere with lots of bear paraphernalia and a newspaper menu.  It's seen better days but was certainly packed at lunchtime.  I went for the patty melt and while it wasn't the worst I've had it wasn't that great either.  Kinda bland.   What I really like is that instead of the typical french fries or onion rings on the side, you can have a cup of soup instead.  As with the patty melt, the chicken soup was average.  I have to admit I'm curious about the chicken fried steak after reading another review.  I may have to try it one of these days, but I won't go out of my way to get there.",

Everyone else at the table loved their meal, and I've had their chicken fried steak before and it tasted fine. It was just a mistake on the kitchen staff, but that doesn't mean I won't come back again.   Service was friendly and fast - even though they were very busy. Portion sizes are big, so will will probably have left overs. They also have a huge menu. The waitress mentioned to us that the whole menu - breakfast, lunch and dinner - is served all day. Unlike their California locations that serve each group separate. She said that Vegas is the only location that does that. So there is a lot of choices.   Out of all the restaurants we took my mom to in Vegas. This one was her favorite.",

DH said the regular was equally as good (I had 3 cups with breakfast - unheard of for me!!). 2. great selection of breakfast options.  I found the perfect \"size\" for me (less than the volcano which DH had, but bigger than the senior plate). 3. sweet cream pancakes - too die for!  just wonderful! freshly made, not heavy, very rich, very buttery. 4. sausage - they say they make their own.  I am from PA where many butcher shops make their own sausage so I think I am quite a good judge there - and their sausage was fantastic!  Grilled, not deep fried like so many places today. 5.  eggs over easy were just that - and not covered in grease. 6.  wait staff was perfect - paid attention to refilling and checking on you but not \"in your face\" - so hard to find that balance anymore.  So do yourself a favor - if you are there on vacation, venture up to the BBD with the locals - you will not be disappointed!",

The hostesses are all very friendly and the waiters are polite and well knowledges about the menu. This family atmosphere is unparalleled throughout Vegas.   Now onto the food...even better! I ordered some of the fresh squeezed orange juice and wow was it fresh. Not something I'd expect to find in Vegas but I saw them personally squeeze it and I was amazed. It was quite the compliment to the food.  I ordered the Joe's Hobo Omelette. Stuffed with a bunch of meat along with onion and spinach. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the omelette was so tasty. I ordered the red potatoes as a side, which weren't as crispy as I liked but still very good. I would definitely recommend trying this omelette.   Finally, the best part, the pancakes. The other two people I ate with ordered the pancakes and couldn't shut up about them so I had to try. One sweet delicious bite led to about 15 more. They were hands down the best pancakes I've ever had. So thick and they melted in your mouth along with the syrup that tasted like it came straight from a log cabin. The pancakes are a must try!! I'm serious!!  If you're looking for a breakfast to start your day off right stop looking and drive here immediately. You will not regret it I can promise you that. Enjoy :))",

Our server was attentive and polite. She helped us choose our order but didn't tell us when me and my husband both ordered biscuits and gravy that one order would end child hunger. No joke. One order was mammoth much less us having two! The biscuits were not like a traditional biscuit. It was more like a large dinner roll. They were definitely not house made.  The eggs and bacon were okay and as many have said the pancakes were the best part. Sweet due to the cream they add but heavy. Not like an ihop or Cracker Barrel cake for sure. I would say it's worth a try.",

Hand-squeezed orange juice, everything made and tasted fresh.  The inside of the diner was super cute as well! Bears adorned the paintings on the walls, hand carved bear families greeted everyone outside, paw prints on all the napkins and plates.... It was so charming! You can tell they took their motif very seriously. Sometimes that might seem tacky but it felt perfect for this homey place.  Staff was very attentive and sweet the first time! The second time, they were very busy so they couldn't shower us with attention. But not really a bad thing! It's nice to see a good establishment get business!   Very nice staff, great food and prices, clean and cute insides, a well put together and extensive menu..  Definitely a win of a place! Stop by Black Bear Diner and you won't regret it!",

Was expecting something unique but was just a regular breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes. Their bacon is think and crispy-must have!   My hubby had the California dream which of course I had to taste it was an all 5 Star choice! From the avocado slices with the eggs to the spinach mixed in the yolk sauce and red potatoes. And although the potatoes were incorrect the first time ( they brought hash-browns) those tasted awesome too and the waiter was quick to bring the red potatoes.",

Collectively I've now had the big bacon breakfast and the chicken fried steak. Both were honestly the best I've had at \"chain\" breakfast joints. Makes IHOP and Denny's look silly. The bacon was fancy store level quality and the chicken fried steak tasted so fresh and recently prepared. The price point vs the portion size makes this place a great value. By the way the biscuits are huge! Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Cinnamon bun French toast is up next!",

The chicken fried steak and eggs is a great breakfast choice.  You get your choice of toast or homemade biscuit.  You must have the biscuit.  It's huge!!!!!  Tastes great too.

    "text": "I think I once wrote a review for this place and removed it.  At any rate, the Black Bear Diner (BBD) on Las Vegas's west side needs to be reviewed.  I once put up photos for it.  I recall discovering it around 2005 and I'm not even sure there were other BBD stores in the valley at that time.  However, it appears that there are now a foursome or thereabouts.  Regardless, this is my \"go to\" Black Bear Diner when in Sin City.  This is solid eating, folks.  I'm more of a lunch and dinner person, but I have been here for breakfast.  Breakfast may be good, but the lunch and dinner fare is great.  I like the selection of entrees, the portion size, and the taste of their food.  It's far from fine dining, but it certainly fills the stomach and is a good value.  Also, if you think The Strip is the real Vegas, you're kidding yourself.  I'm joking.  However,  If you want to rub elbows with the real Vegas, come here, especially on weekend mornings for breakfast when there's a wait.  You'll see newer cookie cutter home dwellers, mobile park residents, locals, foreigners, New Yorkers, Californians, tourists, retirees, casino employees, and employees of anything and anywhere nearby.  It almost makes the crowds on The Strip look like the fake Vegas.  Well, that's not True.  However, the reality is that this is the amalgamation of what makes Las Vegas tick, breaking bread right alongside you.  In concert with that, the service is informal, friendly, and even animated.  The same could be said of their patrons.  Of about a handful of visits over the years, two really stand out.  On a breakfast visit, the duo behind us was very interesting, but I was the one positioned to see them.  There was a sinewy muscular guy who looked like a gangster wearing a polka dot sundress with white tennis shoes and nylons and his hair in a ponytail sitting with this big guy with a beer gut in tattered jeans and work boots.  Now, while it does not matter, the hows and whys this incongrous duo are lunching together might still have you scratching your head.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Cape Girardeau, Missouri.  But it wasn't just that table.  Everyone in there was interesting in that \"everything and the kitchen sink\" Las Vegas way ... and the place was packed.  On a more recent dinner visit, a friend and I were discussing the whereabouts of a previous long term employee we were very fond of, in addition to talking about friends going back to about age 24.  A friendly enough patron approached us as he finished his dinner and started talking to us about the employee, who he also liked.  While that was good to know, that also meant that he had probably listened to half an hour worth of armchair psychology.  After chatting with us, he left.  We then paid the bill and also left.  Once we got into the car, we busted up laughing because we were wondering how much of our conversation he had eavesdropped on.  And you just tell yourself that you're not in, say, Seattle or Minneapolis.  In addition to their good food, amicable service, and the trademark quirky theme and decor, this is the sort of stuff that makes this BBD even more memorable.  The people are \"real\" in that irreverent, free wheeling \"doesn't matter where you're from\" Las Vegas sort of way, making this more of a \"real\" Las Vegas experience.  Black Bear Diner really covers the bases ... from Mt. Shasta, where the chain was born on a hillside where black bears eyed the strawberries, to the I-5 corridor between Portland and Seattle to the Central Valley of California to this one, at Trop and Decatur in Las Vegas.  And, regardless of which BBD I've eaten at, one can count on their consistency and on delivering.",

The waiter was very stand of fish and rude and we're not use to that coming here all the time. I didn't catch his name because he never said it.. as being a waitress myself, a little costumer service and smiles goes a long way. We brushed it off as much as we could but then our food came out. We were so very disappointed. I get the scrambowl every time I come here. This time, it was not hot, like I got some leftover or something and the restaurant was not busy. Also, I hat burnt potatoes and some that weren't but tasted like they've been sitting there awhile. I felt the need to post this because the overall experience was bad. I decided to leave it alone and just leave because it wasn't worth the hassle. Our waiter asked us if we were okay once and then just gave us our check towards the end. To say the least, our food was a bust but maybe it was a bad day.. the service situation? You can't fix that unless we get a new server. The girl with the big bun is always nice and welcoming.",

This is family, relaxed, down home, and comfort all the way! Hence, I tend to come more during the winter months.   FOOD:  Traditional American breakfast diner, I must say that this particular BB makes exceptional biscuits and gravy, so this is one of my must when I do stop by... Other nice dishes are: corned beef hash, steak and eggs, as well as the traditional pancakes, bacon and sausage. I love their Acapulco omelet, I try to eat healthy for the most part and it's both healthy and delicious (egg whites, veggies, and avocado). I'm a big fan of their pancakes and waffles the batter reminds me of waffle house down South!  Every single dish isn't a home run, but most everything I've tried is solid.   CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Staff is always friendly and welcoming, and of course attentive. I've never had an issue with a meal, and I love that they let you customize your meal more or less and LISTEN. I'm most impressed that even under busy and hectic days like Sundays they don't make you feel rushed.   The only True con here is the wait time on certain days in my opinion.",

Soon, my server Marlene came to my table and asked if we are ready for our order. I explained to Marlene this was my first visit here and if she had any recommendation for me. My girlfriend ordered the corned beef and I ordered The Grizz! (recommended by Marlene). The meal was fantastic! What made my day was not just the meal, it was the service provided by Marlene. After our meal arrived, my girlfriend then decided to asked for her drink. Marlene took my girlfriend's order with a bright smile and less than 1 minute, she got her drink. Marlene then engaged a small conversation with us. She gave us a treat and told us about the E-club. I am absolutely amazed by the friendliness and love this place provided.   This was my first visit and there will be more soon.  Thank you again Marlene for providing us such a welcoming experience!",

The waitress was attentive and always came by with a smile. Even the hostess came by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. You just don't get customer service like this anywhere else. Absolutely amazing.   And the food?! Yummy! Probably some of the best chicken pot pie I've ever had. Nice puffy pastry crust, fresh veggies, and hearty. Simply perfect. Also had to try my husband's chicken fried steak and it was great. Perfectly fried, tender, and smothered in delicious gravy.   Yep. Our bellies are full and there's a smile on our faces. Love this place. They know about great customer service and good food.",

It was really good. My daughter had the French toast with a side of bacon. Also very good. One of there signature items is a gigantic buttermilk biscuit with you breakfast instead of toast. It was one of the best I had ever had.   The service here is very good. The place including the bathrooms are clean and the decor was really cool. A solid choice for breakfast or lunch. Also be aware that the menu is much larger than what is shown on the website. I would come back for sure.",

All of the egg dishes (chicken sausage scramble, over medium and scrambled) were perfectly cooked, well seasoned and just plain delicious.  Large portions for nice prices. The biscuits were huge and fluffy. Even the fruit salad was sweet and fresh.  The Chicken fried steak is a must try, even though I can generally take it or leave it.

It might be because I went there at 5, and they weren't prepped for dinner yet?  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken and I ordered the chicken fried steak. They just ran out of soup, and since we were both in the mood for New England Clam Chowder, we opted to wait 15 minutes. They brought us coffee that we didn't order. We didn't get any of our food because we chose to wait for the soup. My friend had ordered onion rings, which we hoped they would bring early, but alas they did not. Her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm. My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well. The steak was crunchy and it might have been better if it were steaming hot. The waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing. They were hot and crunchy and delicious! I only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing.   For our dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate lava cake- both a la mode. However, they premake the dessert, leave it on display, and warm it up.  The cake was kind of dry. The bread pudding was pretty yummy.   We both signed up on yelp to become a member to get a free coffee and bear claw. However, neither of us got the e-mail which isn't this store's fault, but a fault of yelp?  Two tables came in after us and we left later than them. I understand that we opted to wait for our soup. However, we spent two hours in that diner!",

After viewing some YELP reviews about their chicken fried steak, this Texas born and raised girl had to make a special trek across this desert valley to test the YELP opinions about what could be \"the best chicken fried steak\" in town.  So far, this is the best chicken fried steak I have had in Las Vegas.    A rookie visitor here, I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was.  For a busy Saturday morning, with more than a 45 minute wait - the staff was extra friendly and working their tails off.    Unlike some other reviews I see, the place was filled with a very diverse clientele.  Very diverse.  I saw many people from every racial and ethnic background in this place.    The food was excellent.  They have a wonderful kids menu as well.  Our little one had her first ham and egg scramble here - and she ate all of it!    My final thoughts?  It is worth the drive across town for the chicken fried steak - whether for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  If hungry for anything else, I would probably stick to places closer to my home.    For Las Vegas southerners who might crave a chicken fried steak once or twice a year - this is my favorite so far.  Not exactly like my momma's - but nothing comes close to a momma's CFS.",

I ordered a homemade bearclaw filled with apples, it was delicious and piping hot! ($4.99)  For the main course I tried the California Bacon Benedict with hashbrowns. ($9.99)  It also came with a bowl of fresh fruit.   Bene also had avocado, tomato, and spinach; the hollandaise was slightly tangy, IMO, perfect.  Healthy portions.  They even have their own brand of hot sauce with three different heat levels (Baby, Mama, and Papa Bear with habanero).    It was, hands down, the best restaurant breakfast I've had in years.  Pricewise, you will pay similar prices at IHOP or Pancake House, and their food doesn't even compare.  The atmosphere is casual and \"log cabin-y\", with stuffed, painted, and carved bears all over.  The service was prompt, attentive, and very friendly.   This place is aces for breakfast!!!",

They are mass produced and honestly lack in the \"homemade\" taste you would expect anything labeled a \"diner\".  Daughter had the Chicken Parm, $13 - she was trying to convince herself that it was really really good, but from the looks of it it fit on the plate to nicely. Would rather see the chicken hanging half off the plate and spaghetti sauce dripping from the plate, you know rustic diner food, this dish fit on the the plate perfectly, the chicken was perfectly shaped and the spaghetti sauce kind of watery. the cheese on top of the parm looked like a picture right off a banquet tv dinner box. Meh.....  My little guy had the 6oz ny steak off the kids menu. For $7 was a deal, he said the steak was good, didn't touch the veggies. Ate the mash potatoes.  This is where the word \"diner\" should be removed from the Black Bear. They don't make their own mashed taters and the brown gravy tasted just like was power and water stirred till thick, total disgrace. With the mashed potatoes they did try to fool you by having a chunk of potato every 3rd bite. These babies tasted like 6th grade lunchroom taters. What a shame.  Cost $50 for the four of us, not bad, would only go back for breakfast though, you almost have to do that homemade. Well see.",

First of all, there is bear-ly anything in this restaurant that isn't bear themed (so many puns everywhere) making it really fun for kids. It's out on Tropicana ave so you see the mountains as you drive up. You may have to wait a few minutes (11:30 am Sunday we waited 10 minutes) but it is worth it.  Food: 5/5. We tried the regular and the pineapple upside down pancakes(highly recommend), both were amazing and fluffy- the biscuit with gravy is so huge its the size of a dinner plate. Everything tasted top notch. There are really cool and creative menu options and we were sad that we didn't have time to come back for dinner. (we had plate envy of the nearby tables too). They have these mini pies, like the size of a cereal bowl, which are heavenly and can feed a group of 4. Price: 5/5. SO CHEAP compared to what you get on the strip or around Freemont. Portions are monstrous, our milkshake was more like three. You can eat breakfast for 9-15$ a person, but one combo easily feeds 2.",

He proceeded in making me uncomfortable by winking at me making me \"promise\" that I'll text him, or otherwise he'd be very sad. When I left he rubbed my shoulder and said he'd be waiting for a text from me. Made me feel extremely uncomfortable and harassed. Besides this everyone else was great and the food was delicious.

When you first walk in, it gives you warm, fuzzy feelings... Probably because there are hundreds of stuffed bears lining the top shelves of the walls!  I heart stuffed animals! But I digress...   Anyway, I just want to say, this is one of those places where you can \"taste the love they put in their food\".  Every dish is fresh and tasty!  I don't know of any other diner-type establishments that I can say this about.  And I'm so glad I have a place like this right around the corner from me... I now have a \"diner\" that I love!  The only negative:  Since discovering this place, I have a difficult time maintaining my summer \"bikini body\".  Oh, chocolate cream pie and banana cream pie, how thoust torture me so!! *sigh*. Best/worst discoveries ever hahahha!  They even sell their own versions of hot sauces!  Try \"Mama Burn\" to add a little kick to your dishes! (I recommend it on the chicken flatbread for lunch!)  Please try this place.  You won't regret it!",

The corn bread muffin was delivered warm but turned to a rock shortly after, leading me to believe they nuked it ... The batter on the chicken was nasty & the chicken itself was ALLLL FAT! Even the mixed veggies were gross! At $14 bucks this dish is NO BUENO! If you find yourself @ BBD - try the Cali Benedict or the sweet cream waffle & finish w/a personal pie of your liking or the diners specialty - a  big bear bear claw ;) enjoy!",

It was great, cheesy \"country\" decor, great service and great prices. Thanks to Christina for her service, she was very pleasant. Other employees were great as well. I needed something extra and they stopped to get it for me even though it was \"not there area\". They just did it.  The food was really good. I had the The Blazin' Bear sandwich. It was a tri-tip sandwich with BBQ sauce and lettuce tomato and mayo. Simple yet perfect for lunch. I will be getting up early tomorrow to stop there to have breakfast!   It was also nice that they have a no smoking sign when you walk in and it's actually enforced.",

My son had pancakes and the sweet cream pancakes were delicious. You probably wouldn't even need to use syrup. My husband ordered The Grizz and he said it was excellent and we will be back again and again and again. We ordered all this and a pie to go and it all came up to under $50!

I got Mexican resort fold-over eggs instead of scrambled.  Boring chicken fried steak patty. Bacon was gamey.  Pancakes  were too sweet. Didn't need any syrup. Kids will love this part!  The service was decent even though it took a half hour plus to get mediocre line-cooked short order items. Probably the last time I visit a BBD.  The thick-cut hash browns were okay and are the extra star in this review.  Cut our losses short by letting the waitress know our displeasure in the meal and not sending the food back.  Bill came to $33 for 2 adult and 1 child's breakfast, not including $6 tip. A bit expensive when there are plenty of other more popular options.",

By 1 pm, I was looking for brunch/breakfast spot to revive myself by way of eggs, coffee, and cheese. Not in the mood to take a risk, we drove off-strip to Black Bear.   Without a car, I would not attempt the trek here if you're not a local. It's not in the fanciest strip mall or in the best location, but the food is reliable and the service is friendly. I think of Black Bear as what I'm always expecting Denny's will be but isn't: Big servings, fresh food, fast service.   Omelets, Chicken Fried Steak, and other plates range around $10 - and if you order a biscuit as your bread for any of those, you'll have invested in at least two meals; they're huge!   Not the kind of place where I'd return to work my way through the menu, but in a moment of crisis, I'll definitely be back!",

Loved the \"country diner\" atmosphere.. cute and homey. Great menu and choices. NOTE: Portions here are HUGE. Our breakfasts were priced reasonably, lots of food, and quite good. I had some kind of scramble, hubby had eggs and pancakes. We were both very happy.  Place was very full at 11am, and I see why-- good food, good prices, not too far from the Strip.",

Fresh baked bear claws that are the size if a real bear, homemade corned beef hash, cinnamon roll French toast, and multiple grain nut cakes (pancake style) were our choices. The menu is diverse. The coffee delicious. Great friendly service. This diner is a real treat.",

Honestly the bears caught my eye because they reminded me of my dog. We're so glad that we stopped in for breakfast. I had a bear paw French toast which is a battered and fried bear paw pastry. It was wonderful to say the least, good portion and even better taste. My wife felt the same of her cinnamon swirl French toast. We had bacon and hot sausage which were great as well. We both left happy and full plus had a little extra in the pocket for the penny slots. Lol Just an FYI this isn't a quick walk from the strip, we had a rental car which made it a 10 minute drive from the Luxor. But it's so much better than Denny's and definitely worth the drive.",

    "text": "I don't know why it took us so long to try Black  Diner here in Vegas . We been to one in California and had such a good time , can't believe it took us so long to try out this location.  When we walked in the place was a bit empty. Our servers name was Dawn. She wasn't talkative at all but was nice enough to suggest a few things off the lunch menu since I was feeling a little indecisive. That and I sometimes like to see what server suggest seeing that they know the menu better than I would. She suggested the chicken club , so I ordered that without Swiss . And my wife ordered the turkey club. They both came with fries since I wasn't sure what kind of mayo they used I requested mayo on the side.  Later reading the menu I noticed the chicken club didn't mention what type of bread it comes on so I flagged a different waitress to see what kind it came on. She replied whichever kind of I wanted , I frowned replying that I wasn't asked so my wife and I told her we both would like them on white.  When our food arrived everything looked so good, I almost forgot to take photos lol but Don't worry I snapped a few.  The food was great our server wasn't to attentive we had to flag her down a few times to ask for extra napkins refills etc. her service wasn't so great to say the least.  The chicken club was great but I loved the turkey club better! If you asked my wife she loved the chicken club more, so we swapped . And if your wondering what type of mayo they use, it's Best Food. Black bear diner gets an A plus for that .  Oh and by the way I ordered a bear claw to go because I read a review that mentioned they were so good (I had to ask about it because it wasn't on the menu) I wasn't impressed , my mom says it tasted fine & I thought it was dry , I don't know !  Four stars for food  Three stars for service",

When looking this place up they had decent reviews so we thought that this place would be good. When we arrived they told us that it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Though we really only had to wait about 5 minuets. After we were seated the couple after us were seated as well. They were asked about drinks first and we still had yet to see a waitress or waiter. About a good 15 minuets passed until a busser saw us sitting with no drink and asked if we had seen our wait staff. We said no and she grabbed us drinks. It was still another 10 min before our waitress appeared. Also the couple behind us got to order first too. I could over hear that their order was wrong and had to be sent back. Long story short food was average and service was below average and prices were average. Wouldn't come back.",

Again, service was outstanding, greeting me and quickly getting me seated and set up with coffee and a menu.  I quickly found the Volcano (apparently a full 1710 calories) which should curb my considerable late morning hunger.  It comes with 3 pancakes, 2 link sausage, 2 thick cut smoked bacon and 2 eggs.  Just to make sure, I also ordered Orange Juice and Toast on the side to complete my morning gluttony.  As I remembered, the pancakes were nice and fluffy, great buttermilk flavor (I'm a big fan of good pancakes) and everything else combined to make a perfectly hearty morning meal.  No need for a breakfast buffet when I can get this to fill me up.  They were busy for a late Friday morning but service was great and I will continue to make Black Bear a regular stop whenever I'm in town.",

Delicious food, giant portions, fantastically happy and friendly staff!  SPECIAL KUDOS Dan is the manager at this location and he loves it. We connected with him over Northern California (my friend Jessica grew up down the road from him). It's a special thing when you can have a nice conversation with restaurant staff. Speaks volumes about job satisfaction that translates directly into the quality of service from the host, to the cooks, to the manager.  I didn't catch William, our server, without a smile on his face. He was also fun to chat with and seemed to enjoy his work. He kept our drinks full and faces smiling.  Seriously: major kudos and props to the team at this restaurant. We will be coming back every year to relive this experience!  THE EATS Breakfast Burrito -- I opted for something hand held and I wasn't disappointed. The burrito itself wasn't huge, but that was overshadowed by huge flavors. It also came with a side of fresh salsa and a giant portion of their delicious hash browns.  My friends had the California Benedicts and Joe's Hobo Omelette. It would be an understatement to say their plates were clean. There was nary a speck of food left to make you think the plates hadn't come straight out of the dishwasher.  THE VERDICT This place is an absolute gem in this town. Homey, friendly, and downright delicious! If you have an opportunity to try this place, DEFINITELY GO!!!!",

We were pleasantly greeted at the door, and seated right away. I was surprised that it wasn't busier for a Saturday morning.   Drink orders were taken and brought by the worker that greeted us by the door. The waitress took the order. I ordered the fiesta scramble minus the olives. I was glad that they allowed customization. It took about 15 minutes from ordering to when the food arrived. That was pretty good. The orders were exact, and not one trace of olives. Yay! The waitress came by about 3 minutes after the food was dropped off to see how everything was. That was the last we saw of her. Hence the one star deduction. Every time we needed drink refills, hot sauce, napkins, etc. we flagged down the friendly greeter from earlier who was more than happy to oblige. He was top notch and made our experience at Black Bear awesome. I believe his name is Chris, tall guy.   As for the fiesta scramble, it was very good. The eggs were fluffy, and the country potatoes were flavorful. I liked that they served the meal with warm tortillas. I highly recommend this dish.",

    "text": "Everything we tasted was amazingly delicious.  hubby ordered chicken fried steak with extra gravy on the side to put on these amazing freshly made-from-scratch biscuits.  These arent typical biscuits that you get at most places.  They're squared as if cut from a pan and extra fluffly & buttery.   Their sausage gravy was the most savory gravy we've tasted and i am not a fan of white gravy but theirs was too good to resist. Just amazing. i ordered the bacon pancakes and was not disapointed. All bacon pancakes i have had before always fell short of expectations.  These were fluffly, sweet with plenty of bacon in them (Finally!!!).  also their fresh squeezed orange juice was perfect. Would love to know where they buy their oranges!  The place was tastefully decorated for the holidays while keeping their cabin theme. So so cute and cozy!  Their servers were fast and friendly.  Only downside is the waiting area on sunday. There isnt really one for a place that is clearly very popular.  Lots of us were standing and squeezing together before the receptionist in a tiny area that has a big jukebox, cabinet with cute black bears merhandise and newpaper stands and something else that was bulky (i cant remember).  I feared my husband would lose patience with the tight squeeze and leave.  There's a fridge display with lots of delicious looking  home made pies next to the receptionist. I would love to have browsed but then i'd be in the way of people walking thru to leave & to get to their tables.  i have to wonder how they can sell any if their merchandise when there is people standing in front of it blocking most of the view.   But again, amazing food!  That is why there were so many people waiting in an uncomfortable space! It was worth the wait, which thankfully was not long at all for 2 people (10-15 mins?) We cant wait to go back, but i think we'll try a time that isn't busy.",

Took a day off with my love for a day of Christmas shopping and decided to stop in for a late, late, breakfast.  Let me just say this place is perfect if you are really hungry their portions are huge!  I had the Classic 2- Egg Combo with Portuguese Linguica Sausage and he had the thick cut bacon.  You can have toast with this meal but, they recommend, and so do I, the biscuit which is the size of a small loaf of bread, not really but it is huge!  The food was delicious and perfectly cooked and the service was amazing!  I will definitely be back and it will definitely become one of the go to places for dinner when working late.",

    "text": "When in Rome, eat pizza.  If you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.  West Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.    I'll call it CFS from here on out but \"Chicken from Satan\" might be a better acronym.  It's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.  Beef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entree was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBlackBearDiner.com&s=49052610fb33e922c06553eab735ff238b5f02c17d15bee4c21141d84c413aaf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlackBearDiner.com</a>, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!  Funny how \"comfort food\" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.",

Our waitress asked if we needed togo boxes and she was surprised that they all said no.   Well, I can't complain since my dish wasn't bad at all. I guess it's just best to ask the waitress what they recommend so that you aren't left with a mediocre dish that isn't what they're especially good at or used to making.",

So I was delighted to find they're in Nevada too when I was looking for a place to meet someone for dinner.  The woodsy bear kitsch is cheesy, yeah, and so is the newspaper menu. But the food is great, and across many locations I've always gotten solid service.   Black Bear Diner is best for breakfast and comfort food - basically diner faire, but they're made up a little classier than a greasy spoon diner. This location also seems to have plenty of parking and seating, I went at a reasonably busy hour and there was no wait.   If I had to pick a favorite, it'd probably actually be the turkey sandwich. Something about it is just perfect, and it comes with some of my favorite French fries too.",

They are supper slow when it comes to taking an order and bringing it out. The place is smaller that the normal restaurant. They blast the AC making your food cold by the time it reaches ur table. Their gravy sucks. Not as creamy or flavorful. Overall the service is pittyful. Cooks need to learn to execute their recipes better.",

It was delicious. The bread was soft, the meat was thinly sliced, and the sweet potato fries were the best I had ever had. My lunch was $11 and change. It was so filling I wasn't hungry for dinner.  My friend wasn't a fan of the hash, it was shredded as opposed to chopped, bed she found it a little dry. The other friend had the taco salad with chicken, he said it was \" ok\".

They advertise a BLAST- bacon club with avocado. All I can say is, \"My compliments to the photographer.\" The bacon was very skimpy and the sandwich was nothing special. My hubby's linguica and eggs was good, but again, just average in flavor and overpriced for the portion. I had a meatloaf sandwich, my personal benchmark for a decent diner. Thin sliced toasted sourdough, piles of thin sliced red onion strings, and gobs of sloppy BBQ sauce. Based on 3 different items and not one Delicious, we will not be back. Our dishes should have been $6.95 each, not $9.95.",

    "text": "Out of all the swanky and upscale spots my family and I have visited and\\or frequented over the years, this Black Bear is one of my very favorite places to go. We live in the neighborhood and come here about once a month and it feels like home.  The service is amazing and consistent, everyone is always so friendly if just a couple of us, or the whole fam. The food is awesome, the menu is everything you would expect from an old school diner, simple food cooked by someone cares. The burgers are always great, the sandwiches are as well. The breakfast is damn near perfect, I don't think my kids have ever even tried anything else due to this, and we usually eat here at dinner time!  I usually try different things when I eat here and have recently found my hands down favorite, the Blazin Bear! Pulled pork with their special spicy sauce that I had a hard time believing wasn't candy, it was just so good! I grabbed the waiter after my second bite to tell him it was amazing. He was grinning from ear and was almost excited telling me it was his favorite thing on the menu. Even the cole slaw on it tasted great....and I detest cole slaw! They also have great dessert, the pies are all pretty tasty. The coffee is pretty good, too. Kids eat free on Teddy Bear Tuesdays, our kids even brought in Teddy bears the first time we went on that day and they are still up on the shelf after the years.  It's great to have an old school neighborhood dinner actually in my neighborhood!",

    "text": "The entree I had at The Black Bear Diner in Las Vegas was one of the worst I've ever had, but the way our server handled it was so unexpectedly nice that I had to write.  I ordered the Rustic Ravioli because it looked good in the menu. When it showed up on the table it was watery and just tasted like italian seasoned beef. I felt like an idiot because I should have known better than to order pasta at a place like this! C'mon, Black Bear Diner is for breakfast-all-day, burgers, and excessive amounts of french fries! It was a foolish mistake on my part, so I didn't send it back. I ate the bread that came with it and picked apart a few ravioli. My sister let me have some of her yummy breakfast foods that she was sensible enough to order. We decided that when the waitress came back we'd order some blackberry pie.    The waitress (I wish I'd caught her name! She was really tall with light hair, probably in her 40s) came back to check on us and noticed I had barely picked at my watery ravioli.  She asked if it was okay and I think my discomfort with complaining showed on my face. I told her that I knew better than to order pasta here and that I was done with it. She murmured something placating and took it away. When she came back with our pie she let us know that she'd taken the offending ravioli off our bill and that the pie was on the house.     This great service turned a \"Ugh, let's forget this ever happened\" experience into a feeling that someone really cares about customer satisfaction. Good save, guys! Needless to say, the pie was AMAZING. Skip the pasta and get that!",

    "text": "The thing about Vegas is that there are a ton of excellent restaurants off the Strip and in the neighborhoods.  The thing is, you have to either go by word of mouth or just stumble across one.  I want to extend \"word of mouth\" for this place.  It has a very California feel to it, which is a nice diversion from the usual Vegas.  The whole style reminds me of California Adventure/Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland.  It has that same rustic style, and looks decidedly non-Vegas.  And yes, there are plenty of bears and bear pictures and bear statues.... But it works really well here.  It's charming and funny.  I tried their eggs benedict, and they know what they are doing.  I was really pleased by how well done the eggs were, and while I am not so much of a hash brown fan due to the wimpy little potato slivers that usually comprise a hash brown, these are potato CHUNKS.  They're cut as a standard hash brown, but they are huge pieces, and are excellent.  The service here was top-notch.  From the waitress, to the manager who stopped by to see how our meal was.  You know the drill: Manager stops by with the obligatory \"How is everything\" speech, and may or may not care about the answer.  The manager here was very sincere and genuine.  He clearly wanted to make sure that we were having an enjoyable time, and I was pleasantly taken aback by that.  When we left, the manager was again there, friendly as could be, and chatted us up while we cashed out.  There was a handful of staff members by the register, and again, it was surprising how friendly everyone was.  For a first time visit, they made us feel like old friends.  Granted, I've been here one time, and with my limited food experience from their menu, I don't know the full extent of how everything tastes.  But they impressed me enough to want to make this a regular spot.  I really liked this place a lot, and if in need of a new and different food option, this is an top-notch choice, and worth the drive over there.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I are new to the area and randomly picked Black Bear Diner for our first meal in town because of how close to home it is. We usually have one restaurant that we claim as \"our place\" wherever we live and we knew that Black Bear was going to be our new place before the food even arrived! We immediately loved the bear themed atmosphere and the friendly service. We felt genuinely welcomed from the moment we walked in until we left. The newspaper style menus with old articles are fun and different. The menu is diverse and you can order breakfast, lunch or dinner any time of day! We have been going almost weekly since that first visit and the service has been excellent every time. We really appreciate that our first waiter, Anthony, recognizes us and will give us some kind of acknowledgement every time we come in even when he's not our waiter. The diner gets all sorts of customers from all walks of life and I've noticed that every person is treated with the same respect and friendliness. The food is pretty good, especially for the price and the desserts are AMAZING! We've considered just going in for dessert a few times. The only downside is that you can tell that it's an older restaurant but they're actually in the process of renovating so the only real downside is that we have to wait 6 weeks before going back! I can't wait to see what they do to the place and I really hope to see a lot of familiar faces with the staff. They're the ones who make this place great!",

    "text": "This place is so adorable and rustic.   It's 4 miles off the Strip.   Outside there were a few wooden bears, a fun photo op if my son was willing.   This place reminds me of the cute diners in smaller towns, not what I expect from worldly Vegas.   Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the host and immediately seated.   The waittress was attentive and we were served our coffee and milk right away.   She suggested the chicken fried steak which is a fave here.  Hubby decided to be adventurous and ordered it.  Portuguese sausage was on the menu as well, which is unusual for a non Hawaiian restaurant to offer.   Maybe next time, but this time, I ordered my usual diner breakfast... Eggs benedict with Hollandaise sauce on the side.  Plus, the fruit on the side was plentiful which was an absolute delight.  I actually took that to go as a snack for later on.   I also got the diced potatoes while hubby tried the the hashbrowns. He also got the fluffiest Buttermilk biscuit to sop up the gravy.  He raved that everything was homemade.  Note: You have to eat the biscuit before it gets cold. Son got the Strawberry Waffle off the kids menu.  It was big enough for adults and had lots of fresh strawberries, not the gooey artificial kind.  I loved the diced potatoes as they were tasty,  nothing here was too salty.   There were stuffed bears all lined up high on the wall to complement the Bear theme.  Also, the menus were cute in that they were newspapers with the menu items listed on the inside.  Our food arrived timely and since we got there around 8:30 am on a Saturday, we got a table.  Around 9ish, a line started to form.  The clientele appears to be mainly locals, families, seniors, etc.  We were so satisfied that hubby and I didnt even eat lunch that day.  We recommended Black Bear to our cousin and her hubby, locals who had never heard of Black Bear, and they came in on Sunday.  They loved it too.  Now, we have a great alternative to the hotel buffets.  Expect to pay about $10 per person.",

Located only 3.2 miles from the strip, I was very pleased to find this place. When you first walk in, the hospitality is amazing. We were greeted and seated almost immediately. Go early, the line gets long. Cindi was our waitress. Southern hospitality at its best. Coffee was strong but with great flavor. Fresh squeezed OJ!!! Now for the food..... I ordered the sausage scramble. 1 giant biscuit topped with 2 large, homemade pieces of sausage, scrambled eggs and covered in gravy. This came with a side of hash browns that was huge! The plate was filled to the max, all portions are twice as big as they should be. Come hungry, or plan to take left overs. I had trouble finishing the meal, but I made it through.  We went the next day because of the service and food. I ordered the corn beef and hash. Home made corn beef and hash, so good. Nothing canned at this diner. Again with the OJ and coffee. You won't have to eat lunch after a breakfast here.  Pricing was great, like going to Denny's, but with twice the food!!! You get what you pay for and then some!!!",

We had hash browns and breakfast potatoes both were barely room temperature and raw in the middle. The waiter was super busy and it had already taken a while just to get our food so we just dealt. We actually got our pancakes after we had finished our eggs and steak. Lucky too as that was the only saving grace, the pancakes kind of tasted like cake but in a good way. If you decided to go stick with maybe pancakes and eggs no potatoes. Also the iced tea was weird it just tasted funky bad batch maybe?",

The atmosphere is fun, there are carved bears, teddy bears, painted bears, bears everywhere! I loved the decor.  The restaurant was an uncomfortable level of cool, unfortunately.  Our server was friendly, however came to check up on us rarely.  The portions were ample and the prices were very reasonable.  My husband's waffle had a cute bear paw!  Their coffee was better than a lot of breakfast diners and they offered french vanilla creamer, so that made me very happy.  The food comes quikly, but you will wait a while to order, as the serves have a very Hawaiian mentality.  Meaning, \"no worries\".  Anyone who has visited the Islands gets this reference.  I would definitely check out this spot if you are in town and want to head off strip.  It was a good meal overall.  I would likely return.",

However, for some reason I seemed to want fried chicken today, so I ordered it. I must say, that this was the best fried chicken I had eaten in a very long time. It was crispy and had such a wonderful crunch and taste. I wanted to look and see if my Louisiana grandmother was back in the kitchen cooking this up, but I knew better as grandma left us many years ago. It came with \"real\" homemade mashed potatoes and white gravy, green beans seasoned with bacon and onions, salad and a corn muffin. Needless to say I ate all of it and felt as though I needed to be rolled out of there. So, I highly recommend their fried chicken and I will be back soon to sample their other items, all of it just like homemade!",

Server didn't some back at all after delivering food to bring pancakes, coffee refill, napkins, etc. She only came back for the check claiming the kitchen is backed up, which is irrelevant when relating to service.  When I left, manager rung up bill and didn't even ask how everything was because he probably knew how terrible the complaints are in there due to flavorless food and lack of service.  I then told him that I am further dissatisfied as to why he didn't ask how my meal was, but he could care less since it is busy and this place is making money from people who don't know any better.     HELLO!!! THE MAPLE SYRUP THEY SERVE WITH THEIR 'FANTASTIC PANCAKES' IS THE CHEAP ONE WHICH HAS \"HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP\" LISTED AS #1 OR #2 INGREDIENT, but most fatties just eat that up.

    "text": "Honestly, I have never heard of Black Bear Diner before I came here. I thought it was a Vegas/ Nevada thing. Turns out, theres 40+ locations all over the Western U.S., including 4 in the Bay Area. WTF? Shame on me. I wish I learned about it earlier. I would have been coming here more often, checking-in as a regular, and enjoying \"bang for your buck\" meals.   Speaking of food, if you're craving a lil bit of everything for Breakfast, order \"The Grizz.\" It comes with 2 of their special pancakes, 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage links, 1 piece of ham steak and hash browns. They're pretty easy-going on changing things up if you desire. So instead of the 2 bacon strips, I replaced it with 2 more sausage links and in place of hash browns, I went with potatoes. Better. Much Better.   I couldn't believe how big the portions were. I'm still thinking about it. The sausage links are not your average-sized links. No Jimmy Dean, you couldn't out do these sausages. And when the menu said ham steak, I didn't think it was a HUGE ham steak. Not really big but like I said, above-average, cooked just right. Also, the eggs came in 3 and not your usual 2. It helps to have one more. I was happy with the exchange of hash browns with potatoes. They weren't salty at all and they also threw in some chopped veggies. Good contrast in taste and made me wanna finish. I saved the pancakes for last. I didn't really see what was so special about them but just thought they were alright. If by special they meant size, then yes, they win there. Large pancakes for an already large meal. Overall, very complete meal, like it was meant for two.  Our waitress took our orders WITHOUT a pen and paper; she checked-in on us; AAAND she returned my friend's pair of very expensive sunglasses he had left on the table. Say it with me: WOW. I don't t remember the last time I received service like that but it deserves 5 stars on its own. Besides that, breakfast seems best served here. Diner joints like Denny's don't compare. They make Grand Slams look like a joke.   The place is a little weird when you first walk in and see all the stuffed bears hung up across the walls and ceilings, as if someone has a fetish with furry animals or something. But it just feeds into the whole concept of the diner. I figured they must've won all the stuffed bears from Circus Circus, being that it's located in Vegas, but then again I haven't visited other Black Bear Diners so I wouldn't know. Anywho, I may not be in Vegas sometime soon to return here but at least now I have the pleasure of hitting up other ones closer to home. See for yourself.",

Had to wait about 15 minutes (Sunday around 1130AM), but it was no biggie.    We ordered from the lighter fare section of the menu and got a Small Volcano (around $7-8) and a basic egg, sausage patty, hashbrowns, and biscuit (about $6-7).  The small volcano came with 1 sausage (subbed for bacon, no problem), 1 bacon, 1 egg, and 3 pancakes (for $1 more I got the oat/nut pancakes).  I eat big, but still didn't finish the pancakes.  More than enough food.  Good, crispy bacon, simple scrambled egg, and some pretty tasty, hearty pancakes.  All was delicious, and we both hoped they'd come take our plates quickly so we'd stop picking at them.  Service was good.  Coffee kept coming, food came quickly, waitress knew all the answers.  Black Bear never disappoints.  Total was about $24 with tip, a tea, a coffee, and the 2 meals.",

    "text": "Yes. Yes. and YES this place is pretty darn awesome.  As a country\\chicken fried steak connoisseur, I must mention that everything you may have heard is True - they DO have great chicken fried steak. Every bite is worth EVERY calorie. Eachtime I've come here in the past year (I'd say over 10 times), I tell myself that I will try something else on the menu. Um, I haven't - I CAN'T!!! I feel ordering something else will deprive me of the opportunity to enjoy one of my favorite breakfasts. My husband especially loves that they have a \"Hungry Bear's Breakfast\" section - he hates it when he can't get a big breakfast! Even though the chicken fried steak (big foot version - of course) is his all time favorite, he loves The Grizz too. All the food is hot and fresh --but most importantly - consistent!!! That's a biggie.  I love the owner\\host guy that is there every time we walk in and seats us. He is the cutest old guy in the world. Every time we come in he gives us the warmest welcome and has this adorable smiling face. I keep telling my husband - I swear I just want to give that guy a hug.  The wait staff seems to have been working there forever.. They know everything on that menu front and back. The service is always top notch.   We haven't been there for any other time except breakfast but we have been meaning to and probably will in the near future. I would recommend signing up for their loyalty program - you get great deals via email that are hard to pass up.  Definitely recommend this place!!! It's worth a drive to check it out!",

    "text": "We had a failed attempt at going to brunch elsewhere so I popped on my app to figure out some of my bookmarks. It's funny, I used to live in walking distance, but I never tried to go then and a bit sad that perhaps I missed out. It was busy, but the wait was not long at all, about 5-10 minutes. We were amused and creeped out by the decor in the meantime. There are a bunch of teddybears lining a ledge around the main dining room. They somehow seem to just be looking at me, at all times. Hehehe.   The BF and I shared:   Chicken fried steak - I think this is one of the best ones we've had. Its really crispy and didn't sog up with the gravy. Gravy was flavorful and the combination of the too wasn't overly salty which I find many tend to be.   Fajita chicken omelette - this was just OK. A bit too much peppers and everything was in big chunks that it would have been better diced up in it and with cheese present. I can't remember if it's supposed to come with cheese, but it should, I wouldn't order again. The egg itself is fluffy though so they can make a solid omelette here but these toppings I wouldn't do again.   Your breakfast comes with a choice of potatoes or fruit. We tried both kinds. Normally I would pick country potatoes over hashbrowns, but their hashbrowns here are slightly bigger shreds are were good. The country potatoes has peppers and onions with it and those were decent too. My only critique is I'm going to order extra crispy on both next time as the country only had one side sizzled and the hashbrowns would be better with a more crispy top to contrast the soft potatoes below.  You get a bread as well. I got one of their biscuits which is pretty good of a biscuit that I normally don't eat a lot of my bread during breakfast, but I had to eat some with honey and butter. The BF really wanted a pancake, but a short stack is too much and their prices are odd in that it's only $1 less than a full stack so it makes it kinda not worth it. Apparently, you can sub your bread for one pancake and I don't think they charge for that either. We wanted a blueberry one and that was 99cents upgrade. This pancake was really good. I love that they put a lot of blueberries inside the batter since heating up the berries brought out their sweetness and the cake itself was nicely fluffy.   Sidenote, I love their own bottled habanero hot sauce that is on every table. I sprinkled that onto my omelette.   Service was friendly and attentive despite it being busy. She took her time giving us suggestions and answering our questions. We were checked on often and got our drinks filled efficiently. We were seated quickly and we were checked out fast as well. My first time, but it seems they know what they're doing. Despite it being a chain, it didn't feel like one and all items made from scratch is a huge plus. Most \"mom and pops\" don't make their own sausages or potatoes.   We took home some treats too. Their bear claw was alright...the inside was plain sugar with strong cinnamon and not a smooth filling paste. It is better eaten warm and it's more puff pastry and not croissant like some people think it will be. It's one of those personal preference type things. Their blackberry cobbler had me confused as cobbler to me equals crumb top and crust on the bottom and this had crust all the way on the top. Once we opened it, there was only crust on top, none of the bottom just fruit filling hence the cobbler part I suppose since it's a partial crust only. It was decent with lots of blackberry in it, I just wish it was a actual mini pie because the crust was flaky.   Even with a few minor hiccups/preferences, I was still pretty pleased so we will be back I'm sure. If you want big portioned all American, no frills breakfast, this probably should be on the shortlist of choices. If you are into chicken fried steak this will probably be the best you can get in the city.",

I had the Griz breakfast. Ordered it with the hash browns and got the country potatoes instead. Our waitress immediately had it corrected. However, both potatoes lacked flavor or seasoning. The ham chunk was pretty salty, but then the bacon was ridiculously salty and the sausage was mushy texture, fatty and too much sage for my taste. The eggs ordered over medium were ok and more towards over easy, but that's ok. Oh, and then the pancakes. Well, I thought they were ok, but a bit sweet, but my wife thought they tasted too much like cake batter, and they kinda did, like sweet cream or cake batter ice cream. I'm sure that's the way they supposed to be, since they were sweet cream pancakes, but maybe a bit too rich.  I'm a coffee snob and sold coffee commercially for many years, and I would just say their coffee was mediocre. For a place like this, they should have distinguishable coffee with a unique flavor note. In the end, I wasn't able to choke down the sausage, bacon or too much of the ham and hash browns. Overall, just not that great as I was hoping for better.",

    "text": "Brunch date!  I met up with the date buddy at 1PM on a Monday afternoon and was out the door in less than 45 minutes (partially because we were on a time crunch since he had to go to work).  When we first walked in the door, I noticed how exceptionally busy they were.  There were unbused tables, people lining up at the cashier register to pay their bills, and no host/hostess in sight.  I was a tad confused as to what to do, so we just waited.  Eventually, a gentleman came around and greeted us, asked us to wait for a table to be cleaned up, but then proceeded to greet the party of 4 behind us (whom he was obviously familiar with) and lead them to an open table.  I was also a tad confused to this as well.  But we eventually got seated and drinks ordered.  The menu is cutely printed on a faux newspaper, and it seemed a bit huge and overwhelming.  I didn't realize they shoved breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner all into two pages.  It was a bit much.  I ordered the eggs benedict.  The food came out super quick and was perfectly warm.  I noticed right away there were bits of bacon on my potatoes, YUM! And these were real potatoes, not frozen and reheated, but real potatoes.  That's always plus.  Then I noticed there was a GENEROUS portion of hollandaise on my eggs.  It was a tad much for me, but it was good.  My eggs were wonderfully poached and the ham was tastefully salty.  Like I said, we were out the door in 45 minutes, even after waiting to be seated and the cash register debacle of taking awhile to process our debit cards when we were checking out.  I wanted to give the restaurant 4 stars because of the food, but I had such high expectations from reading other Yelp reviews and the service did not deliver.  I do believe it was in part due to being so busy and they did appear short-staffed, but I was slightly disappointed.",

The place was hopping on Sunday morning with hungover twenty-somethings, families with young kids and elderly lovebirds just getting out from the Methodist church. It was loud, a little too loud for my hungover head.  Servers were oddly hipster for this type of a restaurant but hey, they were interesting to look at (more interesting than the 1000 different types of stuffed bears crammed into every visible space).   I ordered the chicken fried steak, my friend ordered the veggie omelet. Both plates were MASSIVE and neither one of us was able to finish. The chicken fried steak was so crunchy and toothsome and seasoned perfectly, I'm dying just thinking about the little piece I left on my plate. The seasoned red potatoes were nice, too. I also noticed that their bread is thick-sliced and looked delicious, but alas, I was too full to touch them.  Prices are ok, $6-$10 for a plate of breakfast, but keep in mind how much you're getting! I wish the noise level was significantly lower, but in a big open room it's hard to control the volume of a crowd. If you're in Vegas, check out Black Bear Diner on Tropicana. It's far, but your stomach will thank you for hours.",

But I will say this the trop and Jones Black Bear Diner is the friendliest and the best one around as far as I'm concerned. So thanks and 5 pats on the back instead of stars.

The consistency is exactly the same! The food is absolutely great-huge portions still and the food is hot!  Despite the fact that there was a huge group of people waiting, the wait was probably less than 10 minutes!  Also, I must say that Don (the manager) is absolutely amazing!!!! I saw him interacting with the guests waiting and people eating. He seemed to be helping his team a lot. In addition to him making a difference for his team, he made personal connections with the guests. For example, he told my son that he had a surprise coming then brought him a balloon and sticker (my son was stoked!) he went on to trick my son into thinking that he thought my son was Spiderman. He returned a couple more times to talk to spiderman and my son was absolutely happy! You always win over the parents when you're good with their kids! Next time we're in Vegas, we're stopping by again! Thanks Don!",

The house potatoes were seasoned deliciously and the wheat toast I had was buttered and tasty. The coffee could've been stronger but not gonna whine about that as I had two cups of coffee already before stepping foot into this restaurant.

My eggs were not cooked as long as I like but, that was minor. We had the Country Fried steak breakfast. We also tried a bear claw, that was very good. Plus the service was great. Not sure what some of the reviewers expect, this is a diner not a 5 star restaurant. As for the guy, who gave it one star because he couldn't take his free meal to go, that is a normal policy at most restaurants.",

The GF had a chef salad that could have easily served and filled up a family of four. The ingredients were fresh and had great flavor. Only. Complaint was that they didn't have regular ranch and she had to settle for their Bacon Ranch (there was none of it left to take home with her leftovers so it really wasn't a complaint with merit)   The daughter had fish and chips, another huge portion good fish flavor but the fries were soggy. They might need a different routine (not leaving them hang over the frier etc to keep them crisp).  I had the Ravioli it was a huge portion I took half home with me as I also had the BlackBerry Cobbler. The Cobbler was amazing definitely worth stopping in for all by itself.   The Ravioli wasn't bad but definitely not the best thing on their menu. It looked odd/out of place on the menu amongst all the country dishes and I just had to give it a try.  The Ravioli had a strong vinegar taste that I didn't care a whole lot for. The sauce outside of the vinegar was good and the pasta/meat was almost perfect.  The service was top notch quick to refill drinks. Quick to bring out extra dressing for the salads. Always with a smile and a country flare.   I'm a fan and will be happy to return.",

    "text": "First time going here tonight with the family. We decided to go since none of the \"usual\" choices was working out. Thankfully it was really close to where we live.   The service, at least to me, is quite good. There was some waiting to do but not horrible. For drinks: mom, lil' bro, and I ordered the OJ. Mom's bf ordered coke lol. I'm an OJ-type of girl. I even ask my grandma to buy bag-fulls of oranges just to freshly squeeze them for me in the morning. I have to say, their OJ was yummy--didn't have too much pulp but you can tell they're not store-bought.   I ordered the Bear Paw Chicken-Fried Steak alongside red-skinned mashed potatoes, corn bread muffin and lots of heavenly gravy. I also ordered a side of their famous Sweet Cream pancakes (short stack).  Mom ordered the T-Bone steak with baked potato and their muffin as well. Bro ordered their Gardenstyle Veggie burger with Jack cheese and fries on the side. Mom's bf ordered the BIGFOOT Chicken-Fried Steak and eggs. He got it with hash browns, but instead of the biscuits he opted for the pancakes.   My chicken noodle soup and mom's salad came first. Soup was okay; not salty and the serving size was just right (since the main dishes were HUGE). We waited a little bit for our orders but I wasn't complaining at all, since I'd usually be getting antsy after 10-15 minutes of waiting. I got my pancakes first, slobbered butter all over and pretty much drenched them in syrup (yum!) Short stack comes with two pancakes the size of regular dinner plates at my house, my mom was surprised at how their \"short stack\" was too big of an order. The top pancake was a little burnt, so that's a bit of a downside, but the bottom one was the most perfect pancake I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. I've been searching for a good breakfast place and I think I've found it in Black Bear! As I was still waiting for my main order, I took a bite off of my brother's veggie burger. The texture of the patty told my taste buds it ain't real meat, but the taste definitely passed the test. Their fries were also pretty good, I actually ate a lot of it (sorry bro!) My mom also gave me a piece of her steak; now, I'm not much of a steak person when I'm not craving it, but that piece of meat was juicy and flavorful. My chicken-fried steak finally came, and the first bite was enough for me to rave about this place. I've had \"country-fried\" or \"chicken-fried\" steak from other places, namely casinos, and they all were too salty or too dry/hard or just plain yucky! I didn't even used a knife to cut it, and when I put it in my mouth it just melted. It was crunchy and creamy and all sorts of heavenly goodness in one bite! The side of mashed potatoes were also quite awesome, I like how they used red potatoes--best kind for mashed. The veggies tasted good too; a little greasy at times but hey, that's what diner food is all about.   We couldn't go for dessert, everyone was just too full and in food heaven by the time we were done. Gave our server $10 tip since she was attentive the whole time. Definitely going back next time I'm craving breakfast food :D",

    "text": "To sum up - awesome diner located off the strip and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to eat here.  To elaborate - great place to eat. It's at Tropicana and Jones in the Smith's shopping center. It's pretty low key so you might miss it, but look for the carved bears standing outside the door. Speaking of bears:. this place is ALL ABOUT BEARS. They have stuffed bears on the walls, carved bears, bear murals on the walls...they love them some bears. It's pretty cute, actually. I love the poker bears on the back wall - they're awesome.  Service is pretty good - I've had good and bad service here, so it really just depends on the server. Food comes quickly though, so that's a big plus. They're not open 24 hours, unfortunately. I think their hours run from 6AM to 9:45PM though so you have a pretty good time window to get in here and get stuffed.  As for the food - HELL TO THE YEAH. It's classic American diner fare - chicken fried steak, meatloaf, sandwiches...you name it. My first time here I had the large chicken fried steak. It covered the platter. They don't have dinner plates - they have platters. HUGE. They load them up with food, too. Come hungry. I don't like meatloaf at all - I can eat theirs. It's that good. If you order coffee they'll actually bring you flavored creamer to go with it. For the record, their blackberry cobbler is fantastic.  All in all, this is a great place to eat. The prices are low, the service is pretty good, and the food is fantastic. Eat here.",

    "text": "Continuing our tradition of a new breakfast restaurant every Sunday, Easter brought us here and it turned out to be a good choice.  Our late start had me concerned that there would be a long wait.  But I was happily surprised that there was only a brief wait before we got seated.  And even though it was rather busy our waitress arrived promptly, brought our drinks and took our order.  Their Easter breakfast special was an asparagus and ham omelet.  I don't see how that dish fits with Easter, but I ordered it anyway.  Being gluten intolerant I asked if I could substitute fruit for the bread offering and they were happy to oblige.  I was surprised that the fruit had strawberries and seemed to be more of an upgrade than a substitute, which was great.  The omelet was good enough, unique to my taste, but it wasn't well blended so the filling pieces separated when I cut into it. Sadly, that subtracted from the full effect of the taste combination, but that is the only complaint I have.  My wife had pancakes and bacon from the menu which she really enjoyed.  Their bear decor is unique and gives the place a friendly ambiance.  The staff was pleasant, cheerful and helpful even thought they were really hustling on what was a very busy day.",

I'm still wondering why they changed the menu a while back when what they had was perfect the way it was.  I ordered the Meatloaf dinner and was disappointed to see the portions were cut down, green bean casserole has been removed from the menu and the texas toast is gone to be replaced with a dry cornbread muffin. After a few bites of my dinner, I was semi grateful that the portions were smaller. One of my friends, who always orders Chicken Fried Steak, was disappointed by the smaller portions and off taste of his meal as well.  If Black Bear Diner wants my business, they need to re-think their \"reinvented\" menu and restore the food quality to what it once was.",

I asked a local where to find a good diner for breakfast off the Strip and he suggested this place. We took a city bus over and loved it at first sight. The food and service did not disappoint either. I had the chorizo scramble and relished every bite. My son said the pancakes were the best he ever had, and he's had a lot. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was tangy and sweet.  It feel so good to be out of the circus of the Strip and have some good, homey food. I wish we had a Black Bear Diner where we live!",

To my surprise, this is what I ordered:  Black Bear Burger 8 inch daimeter  sesame bun 7 inch diameter beef patty & 0.8 in thick  (medium rare recommended) Fries, approximately half a pound, similar to 2.5 servings of In N Out Fries 1 Glass of water  The burger was ginormous, thick, juicy and prepared just the way I envisioned. They do not lie with their portions and motto of serving \"Heary portions for reasonable prices\" (or something like that).  The ambiance was pretty much a \"cabin\" type environment, with stuffed, wooden and toy bears all over the place. It felt warm, and the staff provided excellent service. It was like going to a Denny's in the middle of the forest without the creepiness. For my portion, it was just about $10.  Hope this review helps...I hope your experience was as good as mine!",

Stuffed bears line the top shelves and pictures of bears cover the walls. But ambiance aside, the food was bomb.  I ordered some kind of scramble with avocado, cheese, green bell peppers and tomatoes. It was so delicious for being just that. The cook even gave me hash browns by mistake when I just ordered fruit with it. The has browns were delicious and unique. They were like short fettucini noodles but golden brown crispness. Mmm. I wish all places made them like that. My dish came with a huge buttermilk biscuit too which was flaky and soft.   Everyone else at my table loved their food too. Prices were great for what we got.",

I felt bad for our poor waitress because I literally sent her away 3 times before I was ready to order.   Impressive, extensive menu that has every savory, buttery delicious breakfast treat and combo you could ever hope for.  My girlfriend commented that the crowd was a bizarre mix of local seniors and mature families...and young yelpers.  She was right.  But what everyone had in common were forkfuls of pancake goodness and huge contented smiles.  Oh mama.....are they pancakes or cupcakes??  wow.   I always give bonus points to Vegas establishments that don't feel like Vegas.  This place, as others have said, has a comfortable Northwestern atmosphere, that the owners have succeeded in keeping authentic (if a bit kitschy) with several hundred bears everywhere your eye wanders. Papa Bear swung by our table to check on us, which was a nice touch.  Highly recommended.",

After review the menu I decided on the: ~Fresh fruit bowl (I shouldn't have ordered this because I know that NOTHING is truly in season yet......disappointment) ~A traditional bear claw (tasted like Greek baklava so the husband was in heaven!)  I'm glad that we tried it, I'm certain that it'll be something that he orders from now on!  ~PANCAKES........(sigh) they were so FANTASTIC!  I can't even begin to explain, wheat pancakes with a hint of almond extract, walnuts, and granola.  I topped them with butter, bananas and a touch of maple syrup.  SO AMAZING!  ~He got the Ruben and fries..........I didn't get a bite of the sandwich but the fries sure hit the spot!  ~The place was PACKED so the service suffered just slightly.  Even still, we'll be back again in the very near future I'm sure! :)",

Now I have to say that I haven't had a chance to try any of lunch or dinner menu items yet because the breakfast is soooooo damn good that it's just impossible to look past their California bacon benny or that deliciously fluffy biscuit or the sweet pancakes or the country potatoes or... OMG I'm hungry just thinking about it.   There's so much that we appreciate about the place; the friendly faces, the mixed local clientele, the fresh better than homemade cooking,  but one thing we love is the portions. The food is phenomenal but the fact that they give you just enough food that when you leave you're not leaving with doggy bags full of food for 2 more meals. They don't make the food to be fancy or outrageous. It's focus is wowing your palette, great customer service and providing an excellent overall dining experience.",

They have some new menu items, new hostess and servers. Which was a huge plus. The previous hostess was about as friendly as a hungry bear.  Our server Dawn was awesome, when I asked what she thought about a dish she was very honest and told me to stay away from it.  I had the stuffed chicken with broccoli hollandaise sauce and it was excellent. The portions are still huge. I could not finish all of the food.  The prices are still affordable.

My daughter ordered the grilled steak salad and while it was quite a generous portion of salad, where was the steak? Three pieces, count 'em, THREE pieces of steak. As we were leaving the restaurant, we happened to look over at a gentleman who had ordered the same thing and just received his meal. SIX pieces of steak. Count 'em, SIX! Why the difference? You tell me Black Bear. I ordered the French Dip sandwich. Nicely portioned as well but the meat was overcooked, dry and underseasoned. Now; about the wait staff. Had they just served all ok Las Vegas? It seemed so with those tired looks and inattentiveness. Will we ever go back. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. (The one extra star is for the portion sizes).",

First off, their menu is HUGE but I always order the same thing when I go to this place: Country Fried Steak. It's their most popular breakfast dish and the gravy is oh so good. You can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict either. Their hollandaise is sublime. When it comes to breakfast I prefer the hash browns over the fried potatoes. Portions at this place are massive. The decor is pretty casual, I like all the bears sitting up by the ceiling....so cute!",

Southern country ambiance inside, the servers were friendly and the menu immense! Our party of six ordered a wide variety of items from Cinnamon roll french toast (which was sinfully awesome), to breakfast burritos.  I ordered the country scramble which was biscuits, eggs, sausage, and gravy with potatoes on the side.  Everybody seemed very happy with their selections.  The only thing preventing this review from being 5 stars for me was that I was not a fan of the sausage that came with my breakfast.  It was a large, thick patty that just didn't have the flavor or sear I like in a sausage patty.  Other than that, good stuff!",

Apparently not! We were standing for about five minutes and then seated.   While looking over the menu, I had a good look around the restaurant. I love the ambiance and all the bears everywhere. It's got a much warmer, cozier vibe than most of the breakfast places in town despite being a fairly large chain. It has the look of a locally owned restaurant and I like that.  My mom had the corned beef hash and I had the steak and eggs. My mom really enjoyed her breakfast. I got the wrong type of potato in my order and my steak was a bit overcooked; however, everything tasted really great so I was okay with it. The portions were really big and the biscuits I got with my order were still attached and looked like the size of a newborn puppy (best description I could think of). Service was friendly and as quick as it could be considering it was pretty busy. Great breakfast!",

The noise from the kitchen was very distracting to our conversation, not to mention the sugar ants running around the table. I ordered a drink which they forgot to bring out. Then my waitress, Cheri?, made me feel as if she was very rushy with wanting to take our order, just for the food to take its time coming out.  Throughout the meal we had to constantly get our waitress' attention for refills, that is when we actually saw her, as she kept disappearing for long amounts of time.

A $10 Uber away from the major attractions is well worth it. Food was fresh and plentiful! Sweet cream pancakes are awesome. The fresh squeezed OJ and a healthy serving of grease are what you need to forget your Hangover!",

I was greeted by the manager who sat me and immediately grabbed my coffee, (he must have known my hatred for mornings). It was obviously busy, and I was worried I had made a mistake and wouldn't be high on the priority list because I was alone. My waiter came up quickly and was very friendly. I ordered my eggs Benedict with crispy hash browns... Food came out in under 5 minutes and PERFECT! runny eggs, hash browns on point, even the fruit was fresh. Big portion, couldn't finish it all.   This place was so friendly. The manager and staff personally knew the customers sitting next to me, and treated them like old friends. Went above and beyond in customer service. As I left the manager was giving a little boy a balloon. I had a great experience, and I recommend this place to anyone. Enjoy foodies!",

The waffle was tasty too. I love that there is decoration of bears literally everywhere, it's fun and cute. The menu is an old school newspaper and has lots of options. They even have a national park burger that donates to the national parks, if you're fan of Americana this is a place to check out. Only 4/5 because slowish service, had to go grab my own ketchup off a table.",

I really liked the theme of the restaurant and the cute little stuffed animals that lined the walls. Also for all Pokemon players- this place has a gym, so that's always a plus.

We ordered the fried chicken with red skins potatoes (with brown gravy), green beans and bacon, and cream of potato and the chicken fried steak with red skin potatoes (with country gravy) and Caesar salad. The serving was huge and the fried chicken was juicy and crispy but way too salty. The brown gravy was salty as well. It seemed the only thing not salted on the plate was the green beans, which were canned. The chicken fried steak was incredibly bland. The breading and the gravy was so bland that even with some salt, it didn't help. Overall, the place was nice because their service was nice. Other than that, the food was not something I'd come back for.",

    "text": "Heeeeeey there Boo boo, do you want to go go go to Black Bear Diner?   No Yogi, I raided the camp site, and ate that Chinese family's cat.    Well, Boo boo just stay in the den, and I\"m going going going, and let mother nature carry you on her own.    Yogi, I think Mother Nature is kind of cranky today, but carry on and tell about your adventure to Black Bear Diner when you get back to the den.  Pawing my way into this place on my own, because the reason above and I also had to take my mom to a prearranged medical procedure up the street.    Actually traveling to this place for breakfast is like crossing the Yellowstone park for me, because it's not short trip from Henderson.       There a nice cabin feel to the dining room when you walk in, and at the hostess station has  a  nice display of mini pies in a small refrigerated display case,   Those pie would be been cleaned out of the case if Boo Boo was here.   The interior is surround by hundreds of teddy bears, and a few collectible toys from a few generations before hand.   Well, I sat down and looked at a menu, and that darn menu could doubled as the Yellowstone Gate newspaper, because it had a rather large selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner items.    It took a few minutes to decide what to eat, and the waitress who had five other tables was running slight attitude like Ranger Smith on a bad day.    Perhaps, I just wanted to keep her waiting a little longer, but I really couldn't decide what to eat, after all it was my first time eating here.    Well, I gave up, and asked my waitress for her advice, The Bigfoot chicken fried steak or the Grizz?    At that point, she mellowed out, and said their specialty is Chicken fried steak, and Bigfoot is the signature dishes.    Chalk one up for the chit, and put the order in doll face.  Under three minutes later, my pancakes and main dishes is served!   Wow, that was way too fast, and holy smokey bear this order was huge!   At first, I was a little confused...three minutes to make this order?   Well, I hammered the pancakes, and it was pretty good.  Not the best I ever had, but it was about 7.5 out of 10, and this was the best thing about this meal.   As for my chicken fried steak, it was pre-made, and didn't have that nice crunch when you bit into it.    The gravy was okay, but didn't have that slight sausage flavor, and I hate saying this but I had better at a few mom and pop places around town.   The egg were done right on the spot, and the hash brown was very good.   That morning, I was a rogue bear running amok, and setting a bad example for the other animals, but this review is one of them.    It wasn't a bad visit but it wasn't a great one either, the size portion Black Bear gives are enough for a family buffaloes or one huge Hawaiian bear like bruddah IZ (which I'm not), but what threw off this visit was the waitress (who might have gotten too many tables) and questionable speed of my meal.   I rather wait for a fresh batch of chicken fried steak, than to get it in three minutes.    Did Boo Boo miss out...nope, but they can decide for themselves on Yes or No when they visit Black Bear, and so should you.",

Place is beautiful and lots bears on the roof hanging. their plates are huge and two people even cant finish. I tried the stake and not really happy with the medium rear, the waitress quickly make me a another stake right on the perfection. I  was surprise the service how quick they are. Coffee is the second best for the 7-Eleven coffee. i highly recommend for anybody to go to this place.",

    "text": "The first time I saw a Black Bear Diner was in Yreka, CA. I did not get the chance to stop and was kind of upset. So I was excited to find one right here in Las Vegas. Last fall I tried it for the first time. It was busy and I figured that was a good sign. Service then was alright as was the food. Nothing spectacular. I don't really remember what I even ordered. The place did leave enough of an impression on me to sign up for their email club. I get periodic offers from them though I never take advantage of these offers. Black Bear is not in my area of town. Today, however, I was in the neighborhood and feeling like lunch time was upon me. So my roommate and I stopped in. We were taken to the seating area quickly though our table was not cleared yet. We waited while they cleaned. Our drink order was taken right away and by I think three people. All very friendly. It took several minutes to look through the menu and our server had to come back a couple of times. I almost ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. I went with the tri-tip dip with potato salad. My roommate ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Our food took a little while to come out. No matter though, it was busy after all. Both my roommate and I thought the same thing about our side. It was kind of bland. Neither of us finished our side. My sandwich seemed very familiar. I think it was I ordered during my first visit. It was not overly memorable this time either. The au jus seemed watered down. The beef was mostly tender. The Swiss cheese was great as were the mushrooms. The onions were supposed to be sauted but they were still mosly raw. I don't like raw onion so I picked most of them off. Nevertheless, it was filling. That is a bonus. As for the service after the food arived, it was lacking. I had my empty glass of tea on the edge of the table and was walked passed by our server several times. My refill came after my meal was finished and my plate was gone. I don't think I'll be back any time soon. It has been almost a year between visits and I imagine it will be at least another year before the next. I think I would like to try their breakfast sometime. Corned beef hash is still on my radar. Only time will tell.",

    "text": "Found this place looking for an alternative to the tourist clogged overpriced restaurants on the strip.  It looked like a roadside diner from my younger days in New York and we decided to try it.  It was after noon but I opted for the hash and eggs breakfast.  The hash is definitely not out of a can.  The corned beef was ample and it wasn't pasty like number 10 can hash.  The eggs were cooked to order and hash browns were the wide shredded style and NOT over cooked!!  I also liked that the food wasn't over salted in some lame attempt to generate flavor out of a can.  I was able to add salt and pepper to my taste. Our server was great. It was crowded, not packed, and she took good care of us.  The food arrived soon after we ordered, it was hot and more than enough to fill you up.  The prices were reasonable and a lot better than the $3.50 hotel Starbucks tall coffee I had this morning We had to head back to the conference, and I admired the pies on the way out.  We didn't have time for dessert however the manager boxed one for us.  We enjoyed the banana cream pie the next day waiting on the TSA line.  That started a few conversations with our fellow travelers!",

While on vacation in LV, we decided that we were going to have most of our meals off the strip, to eat where the locals eat, and have some time when The Black Eyed Peas are not blasting in my ears when I am trying to eat.   Thanks to YELP we checked this place out. Loved the decor from the very start, the place was hardly crowded and the menus are printed on newsprint.  Our waiter was super friendly, and the food was great. I had the Tri-Tip dip, the sandwich was cooked to perfection, the others at the table had the meatloaf and the chicken fried steak. All where a hit. For dessert we all split an amazing coconut cream pie.  The prices are really good, about average for what you would get anywhere else. What we ordered would probably cost twice as much, if you could even find this kind of food.  The setting was about 4 miles off the strip and offered a nice change of pace that allowed us to talk to one another and plan the rest of our night.  Great place, if in Vegas this and The Original Pancake House are a must for eating.",

It's like the egg portion is fried separately and then rolled up around the ingredients.  So anyhow the omlette was good but not great.  Mr. Mom's serves up an omlette which is awesome.  The black bear fresh fruit was excellent - nearly the best I've found except for The Daily Egg which also adds kiwi to their fresh fruit so I'd slightly prefer that one.  The entire waitress staff was the most impressive I've seen at any diner - absolutely great!!!  Our server April was simply a pleasure.",

    "text": "I went here for breakfast with the gf and the kids one Sunday.  I heard about this place from Yelp and wanted to check it out.  I like diner eating sometimes because it's a break from so many buffet type places here.  We should have got here earlier on a Sunday, because it was super busy!  Good sign that the food is good here.  We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for a booth but no biggie.  The decor was cool, apparently they're into Black Bears...ha ha...they were all over the place!  When we got sat at our booth, we were right next to this huge machine with oranges.  I had to ask, and our waiter said they squeeze fresh juice from oranges every day.  What a trip.  Too bad it was like more than $3 per glass, a bit pricey but I guess you pay for freshness.  Their menus were cool too, printed on old newspaper articles.    Their menu was big, and we had tons of choices from the breakfast and lunch menus to choose from.  I love my breakfast, so I ended up choosing their 'Volcano' breakfast...it's their most popular.  I got three HUGE pancakes (As big as the plate...I opted for the 7-grain Almond ones for a buck more), 2 scrambled eggs, 2 sausage links, and 2 thick pieces of bacon.  This plate was made for a king!  Wasn't bad for only 8 bucks and change either.  It was seriously one of the best breakfast dishes....ever.  Pancakes were moist and buttery, the links were snap fresh, the eggs were great, and the bacon was oh so yummylicious (nice thick strips).  This beats IHOP and Denny's any day.  Their burgers are humongous as well.  One of the kids had a Bob's Big Bear Burger, the Califoria Burger to be exact.  It's a 3/4 pound (big) burger and had avocado and jack cheese, as well as your standard fixin's of lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, and pickle.  It was too big to put in your mouth!  We had to cut it in fourths just to dig in.  They give you a huge portion of fries too, crisp and delicious.  With some ketchup and ranch, these are pretty killer.    I will be going to this place again when I get the craving for some great diner food.  People were nice and courteous, but also quick.  Good quality and value for the dollar.  I can't believe this place is a franchise!  Sure don't seem like it with the down home charm and the unique decor.",

I have been going here whenever I am in their neighborhood, which is not nearly enough.   I had to cut back.   I couldn't afford a new wardrobe every 9 months.   Don't hesitate to dine here.  You will surely enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "I fell in love with the place before I even ate.  Imagine if your grandmother (who loves stuffed bears but isn't creepy about it) opened a restaurant and it was awesome.  The entire restaurant is lined with stuff bears. Look up? There's a stuffed bear. Look on the wall? Stuffed bear. Look toward the bathroom? Stuffed bear. Besides stuffed bears, wood carving of bears appear both in and out of the restaurant. There's even a painting of bears playing poker! It's thus living up to it's name: Black Bear Diner (even if there are some non-black bears).  It's just one of the places that seem cool and inviting from the moment you step in. The restaurant looks 1/2 Grandmother decorated and 1/2 California Grand Adventure from Disneyland. If you like your surroundings to have a bit of warmth, you'll like it.  But it's a diner and not a museum piece so how does the food taste?  Awesome. That's how it tastes.  I found the place by searching \"Biscuits Gravy Las Vegas\". Several people mentioned this place as having some of THE best Biscuits and Gravy available. Being a former Southern girl, I'm very familiar with Biscuits and Gravy and they didn't disappoint.  Nice fluffy biscuits you can break apart easily. Creamy white gravy that wasn't too runny nor like paste (as I've seen at other restaurants). Great flavor too!  My only mistake was I ordered the spicy sausage patties. Don't get me wrong! They were good and done well. They were simply too spicy for me. Now that's rare as I'm used to very spicy food. Being from a Mexican and Cajun loving background, I'm no stranger to spicy food. Yet, the were really spicy and just a tad outside my tolerance. I could eat about 1 and 1/2 patties before I had to stop.  Next time, I'll get the regular patties. I can't fault them for it. They did ask if I wanted hot and spicy patties and they delivered. I'm the one that couldn't keep up. =)  My fiance had Eggs Benedict with a side of hashbrowns and fruit. Normally I see Hashbrowns that are grated into tiny slivers. Their hashbrowns were more thick which made for a better hashbrown. A nice thick outer shell with a softer (yet still well cooked) center. The fruit was fresh and didn't appear to have any signs of aging.  The service was just fine. I got my coffee filled fairly fast and the manager came by to make sure everything was alright. As a nice bonus, he was cheerful and sincere when he asked. He had that nice grandfather look when he asked instead of the deadpan question you sometimes get. \"Hello. Everything fine? (1000 yard stare) That's great... bye.\" Didn't get that there. Just a nice friendly question.  On a final note, the employees all have a smile on their face. They don't have that \"dead inside\" look, I've see at other places. Who wants to eat where the employees look miserable? I don't.  So if you're looking for an old style Mom and Pop type place (at least in feel since they do have several restaurants), give the Black Bear diner a try. It's my new favorite place.",

    "text": "This is our fave \"neighborhood\" go-to.  We just moved to this side of town in September and a friend recommended them for breakfast.  Since then we have become regulars.  WARNING!  THIS IS A DINER... A DINER DECORATED WITH BEARS...STUFFED BEARS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK!  So if you are looking for a place that is super modern or Zen-Hipster whatever, then the BBD is not for you!!!  Some of my faves: Southern Scramble- their homemade scrumptious sausage (spiced with fennel? sage? I'm not huge on sausage but this stuff is to die for) on top of their huge biscuit with scrambled eggs and country gravy on top.  You can pick hash browns or country potatoes (pick the country potatoes!!!) Shasta Scramble-eggs scrambled with avocado, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers & jack cheese  My husband thought the homemade corned beef hash & eggs were great! (The Bagel Cafe is his ruling stick and BBD's was a close 2nd in his opinion).   THE BEST HAMBURGER!!!! I have to say I have turned into a creature of habit (not of the stuffed bear variety) with their Burger Basket combo! I would choose their cheeseburger ANY day over In-n-Out, Create & 5 Guys!  EASY!  It comes with a huge portion of tasty fries which come out perfect every time I have been there. EVERY time and they taste even better when dipped into their Ranch dressing. For all you Ranch Dressing aficionados, BBD's Ranch is the real thing!!!!  I'm not sure what is going on in Vegas with Ranch dressing but most of the restaurants in town have bland, bottle-brand tasting weak-ass Ranch.  (My fave use to be Cheesecake Factory's Ranch which I use to buy to go and all Ranch is compared to theirs!)  For an extra charge (2.99?) you can order one of their hand-dipped shakes that comes with the extra in the old-fashioned tin cup-we tried the black berry...Once again, delicious!  My hubby has liked the T-bone, Tri-tip and the Prime Rib- he liked them all.  (He is not comparing them to any of the better steakhouses or anything but states they taste like the homemade Sunday dinner you use to get at your Grandma's).    We also love their coffee and the service is always good!  Always! Expect a wait on weekend mornings.",

Gave me time to look at the yelp pics and read some reviews. Chicken fried steak was mentioned in no less than 10 reviews and for just cause it's delicious!! So for a tip I would recommend getting a side of salsa for your eggs. They make it fresh and it is full of flavor!!! They also offer a biscuit, toast or English muffin for this meal.  This is critical for you to have the best meal ever!!!! GET THE BISCUIT!!!  This is not my 1st rodeo with biscuits but this monster is worth talking about. 1st of all it comes out towering over the rest of the plate like a cumulonibus cloud. I know what your thinking \"something that big has to be dry or crumbly hard\" well like me your wrong!! SURPRISE!!! This is biscuit meets Angel food cake.  It is a moist and super fluffy, softball sized creation.  Their European style whipped butter is one of many appropriate toppings for this beast. I had it 4 ways butter, gravy, strawberry jelly, and egg shrapnel all were glorious!!! Enjoy:-)",

But I came here to start a new tradition, because he loved this place. He loved talking to the people, flirting with the server girls (in a cute way, not a creepy old man way hahaha) and I know he always felt so welcomed. I actually think we came here the morning after his funeral in remembrance of him. Anyways, fast-forwarding to today, I walk in for breakfast and it's still filled the love, family and welcome as if you were walking into Aunt Gertrude's kitchen or something hahaha. Just about everyone I've seen looks familiar or I remember from long ago. With great food, exceptional customer service and a wonderful atmosphere I can see why this place is still running like a well oiled machine. Thank you Black Bear Diner (Tropicana) for the wonderful memories I had with my daddy and thank you to Don and Candy for helping carrying on Roy's legacy xoxox.",

Did not know BBD was part of a chain until we started doing research when we arrived.  Our server was friendly and promptly took our order.  Our coffee and water was never empty.  I ordered up the CFS.  It was a damn fine...FINE piece of breaded meat!  The gravy was a nice compliment and not the kind that round house kicks your guts a few hours later.  BBD is home to the magic pancake!  My memory escapes me on just how it was ordered.  Perhaps, it was just to sample and then again...maybe to satisfy some sort of high carb addiction.  The pancake required NO SYRUP!  NONE!  It was sweet, light and fluffy and defied my expectation of what a diner pancake should be.    It awesome watching the plate float around the table as it allowed the others in our party an opportunity to enjoy.  The second best part of the experience was watching or fellow Black Bear explorer dump a portion of the scolding hot syrup which accompanied (unwarranted and not needed) the mystical flap jack on his lap.  Well, one side of his lap.  HIs GF must have marveled at the one half, maple Brazilian he gave himself.  As I roamed out the parking lot, high on fat, sugar, caffeine and carbs, I stopped to look at some of the photos of celebs who have eaten here, and who should I spy...Nicholas Cage wearing some funky outfit!  Had the academy award winner been dining there that day, I would have had to quit yelping because I doubt any experience would have been better than that.",

The coffee was fantastic at breakfast. Everything was delicious except, for me, the strip cut home fries/ hash browns were not cooked well enough for me. Get the red potatoes instead. They were perfect. The portions are monstrously large!  Eggs were cooked perfectly, the bread delicious. I went back the next day and got the eggs, sausage and home made biscuits and gravy. YIKES!! It was massive. And delicious. The biscuit was bigger than my fist. We went back that night for a light dinner. The soup and corn muffin was delicious. The coffee tasted a little bit burnt to me.  I mention this to the server and she apologized and went a brewed a fresh pot. All this about an hour before they closed. I will eat at a BLack Bear Diner whenever I am on vacation and I can find one. Don't pass this up if you are looking for some down home, country comfort food.",

Prompt friendly service from Flor and the rest of the staff despite big crowds (because it got to the point of having a wait time once we were leaving, with people crammed into the ante-chamber by the door), and for people like me who don't eat a lot of meat they can sub in a Beyond patty for any of the burgers! So I got the one with the Parmesan-crusted Sourdough, of -course-, and it was incredible. My husband got the Cinnamon French Toast which was incredible, dessert for breakfast. We walked out with leftovers, and it was just as good two hours later for lunch. Definitely will be back!",

It looked like all the seats were taken, but by our stroke of luck there was one empty booth we managed to snag right as we came in.   Fun fact that it kind of irrelevant at the moment, but will come to play as my review continues is that I have a Black Bear Passport, which you should consider getting if you go to Black Bear frequently and enjoy traveling. It's kind of a fun rewards program they have that you should look into if you haven't already.   Anyway, continuing my review, the staff here seemed really nice and somewhat friendly. They were pretty busy so they were pretty rushed and going back and forth everywhere between tables and to the kitchen and what not.   My brothers and I all have the passport and we laid it out on the table, which made like pretty much all the staff members came by and strike up a conversation with us about how many stamps we had etc., etc., etc. They all kept saying they'd get our booklets stamped since the moment we came in but it didn't happen till the very end of our meal lol.   Food wise, it tasted just as great as any other Black Bear location. Although, I feel like they give a bit less than the other locations, but I'm not really complaining because the portions at Black Bear are pretty huge and cheap anyway. I definitely recommend the pancakes here if for some reason you haven't had them already.",

    "text": "This is your basic all-American diner. The decor is cute with wooden bears (duh) and wooden chairs and tables to give it a rustic/lodge look. But tbh, I came here for the food, not the decor. I got the ScramBowl which comes with a side of homemade biscuit and gravy. It's decent but nothing memorable. However, I did really like the gravy which is probably where all the calories are haha.   One thing to note is that there are calorie counts beside each dish on the menu...which could be nice or not really because sometimes I just like to be oblivious to how much calories I'm ingesting. I appreciate the honesty though.   Main reason for my 3 star rating is the service and the amount of time it took for the food to come out. I seriously think we waited close to 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't like they were that busy. The waitress would disappear on us and when she did magically appear again, we had to ask for refills on our water instead of her just doing it. She also dropped the check off without even saying anything so we sat there for a while thinking she would bring it to us. I finally looked around the table and saw she dropped it on top of the condiments...because that's where most people leave the bill?   I don't think I'll be back. Maybe if I'm feeling for basic breakfast and mediocre service.",

The spinach and tomatoes were OLD, the eggs were barely cooked, the English muffin was soggy, and the potatoes were completely mushy with RAW onions.   I ate half of it so I didn't have to waste my $16, 30 minutes later I'm sick to my stomach.   I never leave reviews but this place is seriously nasty. Expired, undercooked/overcooked food.

I over heard the kitchen staff talking about spitting in some knes food because they had me sit right beside the kitchen door where i could see and here them. When it was brought to the managers attention he didnt even looked shocked like he had heard it befor but told me there was no was they said that. I told him where i was sitting an how loud it was and that for sure i heard the litchen say it to a server who was back there with them. That manager did not try to handle the situation or do anything about it. The cooks wasnt wearing gloves or beard/ hair nets not even an apron there was absolutely no care in that kitchen. Its just said that i didnt pay any attention to them until after i heard what was said. I will not recommend this location to anybody not even an animal it was the worst experience ive ever had in a restaurant. That restaurant makes all of the people who love cooking or even have a degree in culinary industry look bad. Again IF YOU DONT WANT SPIT IN YOUR FOOD STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!",

I've been in food management and I can speak from experience when I say that is the fault of the management. I was told they were waiting on a late truck. That is not an excuse in a place like this you always order to get you past your truck delivery. I felt sorry for my sweet server so I tipped or anyways even though I walked out of the restaurant without eating. I let the manager know before I left that she was a sorry excuse at doing her job. My suggestion to the franchisee is get yourself new management!",

Late lunch yesterday, my \"trip tip\" French dip was Smokey flavored brisket. Not the thicker cut, beefy flavored trim tip. Next was a turkey pot pie. Always a specialty, wonderful, homemade dish. Yesterday... the turkey was chopped up to the consistency of baby food. Awful! My daughter's fries were greasy. Our waiter called me \"Honey\" several times and then we had to wait about 5 minutes to pay the check. The place was not busy but for those 5 minutes you couldn't find anyone to collect the money as we stood by the front cashier stand. Didn't have enough cash to just leave it on the counter so we had to wait. Never again! Sad!",

I am quite certain this was my best breakfast experience in recent memory and possibly the best Chicken Fried Steak I've had in Vegas. They have knifes big enough to take down a tree, but there is no need. Tender and flaky, a fork was all I needed to tackle this breakfast feast. I went with country potatoes cooked up fresh with peppers and onions. It comes standard with a  biscuit or toast. I opted to substitute a pancake, which Candy obliged without hesitation. The pancake was so good we passed it around the table and ordered two more. They come with plenty of piping hot syrup, which is a good thing because JR drenched his pants with the first one. No need to wax this week. The over-easy eggs were cooked to perfection and the coffee was better than average. Our server, Candy, was as friendly as they come and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Great food, friendly staff and, with buddies like JR, great entertainment.",

    "text": "Second go-round at Black Bear Diner involved my husband and his cousin along with her boyfriend. The couple beckoned upon us to dine with them since they were in town for a friend's 40th birthday. My husband's desire to eat off the Strip made our decision become Black Bear Diner this morning for a late breakfast around 11 AM.  The restaurant still retains its homey vibe with all the bears looking down upon your from the rafters. The newspaper menus are a nice touch, especially with their extensive menu items.  I was tempted to order a more lunch-like item, but everyone else seemed to be going for breakfast. I didn't feel like too many eggs or pancakes so I decided upon their combo-type plate which allow you to choose from a few different options to make a specific breakfast meal for yourself for $8.99  My order included biscuits and gravy, link sausages, and eggs over easy. Black Bear provides a heaping mound of food - don't worry, you will not leave this place hungry. My biscuits and gravy were all right. The biscuits were delicious and flaky, not too dense, but not too airy either. However, the gravy was lacking. It certainly was lacking bits of sausage, which I would expect more of and it was lacking a salty-taste. Unfortunately they were a miss for me. My eggs were extremely runny. I realize I ordered them over easy, but even the white were a bit under cooked for my preference. The sausage links were tasty.   The only other thing I can comment on is apparently their homemade sausage patties contain fennel seeds, which understandably, some people do not enjoy, myself included. My husband's cousin ended up picking out quite of few of them from her patties so she could enjoy the meat without so many seeds. So - if you don't like fennel - beware!  I'm going to stick with my 4-star rating, especially since service was good, the coffee was good, and because the bit of pancakes I ate off my husband's plate were very good as well.",

It's your typical at home \"local\" diner feel with all the bear chatskis that you could want.  Though we did not have our little one with us on this trip all the kids appeared to receive a balloon tied to their wrists.  It had a great family vibe to it.

I wrapped it up and took it home for my dog (who will normally eat anything), but even she turned up her nose at it. I previously gave the Black Bear a 5 star review for my first visit 3 weeks ago, but I am afraid that this experience barely warrants a level of 2 stars.

At this time, i asked the waitress for an orange juice for my daughter which she said she would bring out (it didn't come until i asked again for the orange juice once our food finally arrived - she didn't come back to our table from the time we ordered until we got our food). I would've hoped for a bit better service, since i was waiting on refills for my coffee and my water.   The food was very good, I ordered the Hobo Joe Omelette. I will give this place another chance since the food was very good, hopefully i do get better service on my next visit.  I liked the atmosphere and decor as well. Very casual place where you can eat and relax.",

What made this particular experience fantastic was the extraordinary service we received from Mindy, our server.  She was efficient, quick and extremely friendly.  We found out through our conversations with her that a few of us had common interests,  such as, hunting, horses, rodeo, etc., which made the dining experience even better.  We come to LV one or two times a year and we will surely visit this location again.  Thank you again, Mindy!!  Oh, and the food was great as usual.",

I sit and daydream about these pancakes during my off-time.  Other food is traditional fare for a local diner: They taste as expected and food is generously portioned. They should have a little something that should satisfy any craving on their menu.  It's a bit weird eating a meal with surrounded by hundreds of stuffed bears lining the ceiling though. All of that creepiness  is usually  forgotten once that sweet cream pancake hits my tongue.",

(pics in the profile!) it was deeeeelicious. my co workers were staring at my food when it came and while i was eating. yeaaaaa i saw you!! lol. the portions are hearty and i was hungry so it was perfect. hash browns were thick and chunky and crispy and scrumptious! toast was thick and buttered just right i didnt need to ask for more. and the OJ!!! it was 3.69 for a glass... a little pricey? but im pretty sure it was fresh squeezed and worth EVERY penny.   my friend got the cali omelette. dont know what was in it but i saw avocado and she ate it all so i know it must have been great.  services was excellent. we were checked on several times and drinks were refilled promptly. when my co worker asked for ranch the server remembered to bring it with her food. usually i have to ask again after i get the food but she was on the money.   excellent choice for breakfast. i cant wait to try their lunch and dinner!",

Not Quantity over Quality.. Quality with Quantity!  Homemade Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: Yes, shredded/chunks of real corned beef that was consumed in minutes! Too bad this wasn't loaded like the Bigfoot chicken.. dish! The country potatoes with the onions and pepper, soo good!

For 930 am on a Sunday morning there was quite a crowd of people waiting but the place is so big that we were seated within 15 minutes.     As you walk through the door the decor is definitely \"black bear\" themed.  A shelf of stuffed bears circle the restaurant-every stuffed bear you have ever seen is up there.   Probably a little creepy at night.  Just sayin.  So we sit down to order-we are famished!  So in honor of St. Patricks Day I HAD to order the corned beef hash.  The waitress was pretty nice and seemed to know every guest seated around us.  It actually looks like a place where the regulars would go. :)   My friends ordered some kind of nut grain pancakes and biscuits and gravy.  My friends husband had the nut grain pancakes and I thought for a second \"what are you thinkin\" but I let him make the mistake on his own as he is the biggest breakfast guru I know.  He was very sad and disappointed but ate the whole thing even though he didnt like the tast.  The busquits and gravy was just that....a plate full of stick to your ribs gooey biscuits with white gravy.  Looked yummy but I would feel I would need something to go with that...It was huge by the way.  The corned beef hash was incredible with their homemade potatoes.  Toast a little on the dry side but all in all - I ordered the best breakfast out of all of us. ;)  On the way out they have these homemade pies-individual size.  They looked amazing and I was half way temted to grab one to go.  Maybe next time.  I wouldnt mind trying this place out again to try something different.  Its a little out of my way but ya just never do know where you will end up on a Sunday morning on the town. ;)",

Has a black bear theme through out. Food is good. Customer service was great. i felt like everyone that worked there included my server checked on me and made sure everything was ok, and it was. Good home feeling there. I would definitely return and recommend this place.",

    "text": "AMAZING BISCUITS. Stopped here on our way out of Vegas for our last meal. Perfect choice! Everything seems to be made in house, down to the sourdough bread. We walked right in and were seated immediately. We ordered the Bear Breakfast (french toast, 2 eggs, and bacon) and the Godfather omelet. Both were some of the best breakfasts either of us have had. French toast was perfectly cooked (not eggy) with a hint of cinnamon and the omelet was stuffed full of veggies and sausage and a marinara sauce on top.  The portions were huge. We'll definitely make this our pre-15 Fwy meal every time we're in Vegas from here on out.",

I ordered The Gobbler sandwich, which was good but not great and certainly not five star amazing. The fries came out a little bit lukewarm and the oil tasted weird, so I sent them back in trade for some mashed potatoes which were slightly overcooked but otherwise nice.  My co-diner ordered chicken fried steak, and in her own words \"wolfed it down.\" Came with aforementioned slightly overcooked mashed potatoes, some very overcooked mushy green beans, a corn bread muffin that was alright I guess, and a garden salad that was fine and came with a surprisingly tasty ranch dressing.  We got a free bearclaw from a coupon we'd found on the internet. Super mediocre, and I'd have been very unhappy to buy it at any price. I'm used to the baked-fresh-daily bearclaws from Panera, but this thing came out cold, solid, and covered in clingwrap. \"It's... not fresh. It's maybe three days old. It's a puff pastry, but it's very dry. If you bite into it, it explodes all over.\"  Overall we've had better experiences from our local Denny's.",

This place gets pretty packed on a Sunday afternoon but the turn over is pretty quick.    I usually come here for breakfast items, but will occasionally have a burger when I feel like it.  Food is a-ok but definitely had better breakfast at almost half the price.  The pancakes are fluffy and moist, which is a super plus.  I like their classic cheese burger too.  Everything else is pretty standard, but i must add that i haven't ventured off to their dinner items.  Portions are huge and that's not necessarily always a good thing.  A bit excessive if you ask me; if you're not too hungry sharing would be wise.  Service is whatever.  I'll occasionally get a really friendly waitress who's personable and sweet, and then one who's rushed and without much personality.    This morning i had the latter.  I was craving French toast and noticed all they had were cinnamon French rolls (their take on French toast).  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested it as being really delicious.  I took her word for it and left it at that because she seemed slightly impatient.  I would not recommend this dish!!!  It was cold, dry, too sweet, and hard.  It reminded me of a failed attempt at a Cinnabon.  I took a bite, put it to the side and shared my BFs omelet.  I actually really did try eating it though.   Waitress comes up, asked if we needed a box, I said no, and she asked whether I liked my dish.  I said no, she hesitated about whether she should drop my check or possibly take my uneaten meal off of it. She decided to drop the check and went on her way.  Whatever.  The food wasn't expensive, but I definitely wasted $10 because I couldn't bring myself to eat that crap dish!!  Anyway, overall this place is a-ok.    Will I be back?  Yes.  Not anytime soon that's for sure.  I'm definitely passing on the cinnamon french roll next time and I'll pass on that waitress too.  I must add that their coffee is delish! =)",

However, the service was a little reminiscent of what a normally experience at a Denny's or Cocoa's, but with better food.   I ordered the Shasta Scramble which came with avocados, spinach, tomato, onion, bell pepper, and Jack Cheese all served with a housemade biscuit. I can't remember the price, but I know it was under $10.  The three egg scramble was well scrambled and seasoned. I liked that they did not hold back on the avocado and vegetables, especially the spinach. The sprinkling of Jack Cheese was light, but just right, and the onions and peppers still had a slight crunchy appeal.  The potatoes were simple but effective. They were cooked well with a little browning on the outside and tender inside. They could of benefited from a little extra seasoning. The biscuit was okay. It was baked to mild density and was moist. However, it's flavor was a little bland, with its spotty areas of salt. I was glad they served the biscuit with soft whipped butter.   Service was okay. I felt our server was forcing a smile or perhaps she was just not a morning person. Anyways, she was friendly enough, but it just did not feel genuine. On the good side, we got served, ate good food, and had no issues, so that's all good.  3.8 stars is what my gut tells me..",

Decent Diner grub with very friendly and prompt service. I am a sucker for a plethora of dipping sauces, and on the table they had several different pepper sauces. My favorite was the baby burn sauce. The flavor balance of it was perfect on the hash browns and over over-easy eggs on my country fried steak platter. The country fried steak was a little on the small side but had a good flavor to it. On the downside I got the biscuit originally which is a thick biscuit that is more reminiscent to a cake then something you will find in a diner in Mississippi or Louisiana that is referred to as a biscuit. Luckily the waitress or move the biscuit and gave me a couple slices of toast which hit the spot. The service here really is impressive because I left my credit card here by accident and they had it for me at lunch when I came back and I noticed there was no erroneous charges added to it :-)",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my meal at Black Bear Diner - I just had a chicken club sandwich and fries, but I thought their prices and their portion sizes were excellent and the food was very tasty. There's nothing super special about this diner, and there doesn't need to be. It just has good food at good prices in good (and probably too large) amounts. The service was pretty prompt and on top of anything we needed.   My companion had a half sandwich and a chicken noodle soup combo. She didn't really like the soup as it had a bit of a sour flavor to it. I figure they add some kind of lemon or some veggies that add sourness but I wasn't sure why it was sour. However, her half sandwich was a good quantity and that combo was only seven dollars.  I didn't have enough room to try their dessert but I think I'll be back here when I'm in the mood for some diner food.  One thing that was a minus to me was the tables at the booths are tilted, as they are attached to the wall and sagging. It's not a huge problem but it is a tad awkward and it feels a bit run down because of that, and I didn't feel comfortable leaning on the table.",

Their chicken noodle soup came out hot and tasty with a nice piece of cornbread! My daughter had the pancakes, bacon and sausage. She enjoyed it. But was too busy eating my soup to finish her food.:) My husband had the ribeye, mashed potatoes and green beans. His comment was it could have come out hotter. Overall, I enjoyed the experience.",

Maybe I just expect too much in general, but I thought their menu would've had more of a variety of foods.  Decided to check them out because we wanted a cool breakfast joint. My boyfriend usually orders skillets when we go out for breakfast...but big bear doesn't have any skillets on their menu! That was a shocker because skillets are freaking amazing!!!! Don't you guys agree? Anyways...he decided to order a meat omelet with hash browns (so boring compared to a skillet, LOL) and I had the corned beef hash with biscuits and hash browns. Talk about carb overload! I felt so heavy after my breakfast meal, I literally ate only half my biscuit and some corned beef. Don't get me wrong, my food was good and I enjoyed it. But maybe I was so full because of all the hash browns they put on my plate. Service wasn't bad, an older gentleman helped us while we were there.   Probably not coming back here, sorry big bear! I just wasn't all that impressed.",

The newspaper style menu was different since we didn't realize that what it was till we asked for a menu.      The food was everything I had hoped for.  I got the Grizz which was prefect.  I got my eggs scrambled and then added the chipotle hot sauce which was very good.  The ham was sweet which a slight smoky taste and was quickly devoured.   The bacon was crisp and the sausage was very good also.  The pancakes were perfect.  They were sweet and fluffy.  The hash browns were very good and done home style.  I couldn't eat everything and had to load up a to go box since it was so good.  I would come here again and will be back soon!",

This is just the kinda place to want to support.   Everything I've ordered I've loved! The dinner special are an incredible value. If you haven't tried this place yet get on it!

This time when I went in the servers were running around frantically, the hostess was cleaning tables and our service was sub par.  This was really strange and made me curious as to why this changed so much so fast.  I had to ask, so on my way out, I asked the hostess what's going on in here, were there call outs?? I won't mention her name, but she explained to me that the manager or owners, I don't recall who decided to cut staff.  Bad idea in my opinion for any respectful business, the customers pay your bills, and now they are receiving poor service, which will make them not return, you turned a relaxed calm environment into a stressful one, servers were in a huge hurry, no time to build rapport with customers. A successful business should be expanding, not cutting, that's going backwards.  This is my go-to place for consistently good food and service, and honestly I don't think I'll return anytime soon.  The food is worth the visit and I hope management wakes up and realizes they are ruining a good thing.",

It was over cooked and there was either really hard gristle or bone in it that damn near broke my teeth. Worst experience I have had with food at this place. Generally the food is good but there is no excuse in serving food that is so over cooked that the gristle/fat becomes hard as a rock and can cause dental harm and a meal that is $11 cost you thousands in dental expenses",

It was about a 10 minute wait,  and we were greeted by a very joyful, enthusiastic man. Really would make you smile.  Looking around,  everything was themed- the curtains, poles, napkins, cups, even the back of the seat and the condiment holder on the table!  The menu came as a newspaper,  very cute,  very reminiscent. You can order anything on the menu,  breakfast, lunch,  dinner,  anytime. We went around noon and decided to order breakfast.  The portions were huge! We ordered 2 meals and basically filled up the table! The food was really good too :) very pleased.  Service is yes. Very sweet, helpful, and sincere server. :) Will definitely keep this as a regular stop everytime we visit vegas!",

Will was our server and he was just as nice. Anyway the food as usual was good and plentiful. I had eggs benedict which I love here. They use very flavorful thinly sliced ham (instead of that hard to cut thick canadian bacon!) My husband had steak and eggs with a side of one  pancake. Steak cooked perfectly.

Just watching her work makes me tired. She be humping.  Getting drinks, taking orders, fulfilling orders, bussing, closing out checks, making sure customers are doing good, and doing all of this with a positive attitude and a smile on her face. Such a comfortable and homey place. But now Marlene's not there and seem like that place is going downhill. New management want to run things with the bare minimum. Not enough staff and running out of menu items. C'mon now,  take care your workers, they'll give their 120%. Take care your costumers and they'll.  come back. I know it takes teamwork to run things  smoothly but you also need a team leader and Marlene was the perfect one for the job. I'm just unhappy that Marlene's not there anymore and that I have to go elsewhere. Such a shame....this management is going to close this place down! Gonna miss that fish fry and taco salad. Blueberry Hill..... Here I come",

No cheese and the bun was a little stale. The cole slaw was very vinegary. And to top it off, my drink refill was wrong.  Normally I would have sent the back but it took so long I was starving.

We waited for 20 & she had already seated a group of people who came after we did.. Same name but party of 4. We look down on the list and it showed that my boyfriend's name was crossed out.. As if we were already seated. But no. We were not.   Yes, I understand it was busy. But when more than one group who have been waiting longer than others are not getting seated when they are supposed to be, you guys have a problem. We & another family who got skipped ended up walking out because of the inconvenience. Terrible. I hope when we decide to come try this place again someone who knows what they're doing is the host.",

We had an amazing experience here at the black bear diner!!",

I know Vegas has become fu fu when it comes to dinning experiences and I can share with you plenty of $$$$ restaurants, but paying $6.50 for a slice of pizza just because your on the strip is ridiculous!  So do yourself a favor find a place off the strip. And this was one of them that was not only reasonable price, but service was outstanding!!! Sunday brunch can be busy, we were told 15 minutes, but it was more like 10. Immediately we were asked our drinks and than our waitress Flower stopped by to take our order. Classic eggs Benedict with hash browns were $9.95/ on the strip, I'm sure it was going to be $15-20. The lunch menu looked just as good and really considered coming back, that's how good it was. If you come to Vegas to dine at high end, celebrity chefs.. This ain't your place, but if you want a great diner, home cook meal, you'll be pleased!",

Maybe it would be a lot more appealing if there were snow covered mountains outside and our legs ached from skiing too long and all we wanted was hot cocoa to relax.   Unfortunately it's not... It's in Vegas. Totally random.   With that said, it's sort of a family tradition. And the waiters are nice! See you there?",

I was surprised to find a Free Entree Coupon in my email recently.  I guess I signed up for their restaurant club and they sent me a coupon for my birthday... how sweet.    So I decided to place a couple entree orders and pick it up for dinner for myself and my girlfriend, driving out of my way, but hey, a free meal is nice these days.  To my disappointment, the cashier, while checking me out indicates that I can only use my Free Entree Coupon for Dine In.  But that fine print is ultra fine and tiny, on the 3rd line at the very bottom of the email.    I don't know about you but I am really tired of being TRICKED into visiting an establishment and being forced to partake in a dining experience not of my preference.  It's very easy to be transparent with customers and that is what I appreciate.  Anything else is excruciatingly frustrating.  I can't see returning.",

    "text": "My daughter and I had breakfast here this morning. It is usually a pretty good and convenient place to pick up a home style breakfast but today \"not so much\". To start the waitress brought us water in dirty water glasses. The waitress brought me another glass of water which a little later I realized later that the glass also had old crusted food particles on it as well.  Then I ordered a medium rear New York Steak and eggs and my daughter ordered the triple bacon club. The waitress brought me a bloody rear Steak  and my daughter's club sandwiches had a hair in it. We both excepted new plates of food because we had been to Black Bear several times and the food was amazing so we did not want to totally throw in the towel on the place. By this time I brought the issue up to the manager. Hoping that whatever was going on in the kitchen could come to a stop after his intervention. Our food came back with almost no issues.  My daughter's club was perfect and tasted great but unfortunately my Steak was awful. It had absolutely no flavor and tasted dry, for a medium rear steak that's usually hard to do. I had to drown it in there Steak sauce to even eat it. The Steak sauce was great. So back to the water glass.  I was unaware that during my second discovery of the the dirty glass that the manager had observed my dismay. He immediately came over to the table, apologized and brought me a fresh glass with great tasting cold water.  We are finally through our meal when another manager comes to the table with our bill. He took off my daughter's club sandwich.  I was not expecting that at all. And yes we still tipped the waitress very well. I applaud today's manager's. Thank you. Unfortunately I have to give Black Bear Diner a 2 finger up wave.",

All I wanted to do was find an inexpensive diner with some good food for myself, my wife and our two kids.  From the moment we walked into the door, every staff member gave us a smile and made us feel welcome while attending to their normal duties.  It immediately came across as a warm and happy environment.  I love when I can walk into a place and feel like the employees actual like where they work.  Service was superb as we were immediately seated, drinks never ran empty and the waitstaff constantly checked in with us without brooding or coming off as imposing.  My wife and I were both torn between dishes, so our server, Anthony, let us know his favorites.  The food did not disappoint as I had one of the best home cooked chicken pot pies I have had in a long time.  My wife was beyond stuffed with her Chimichuree steak dish.  My son plowed through his ribs and my daughter was thrilled to have dinner pancakes.  We were fortunate to meet Marlene, the night time supervisor, as she made us laugh and smile.  As a recent Las Vegas local, I can definitely say I would recommend Black Bear Diner to anyone looking for a great meal at a reasonable price.  Further, my family and I will become returning customers.  Thank you for a great meal and a good time.",

When we entered the restaurant, I was immediately taken back by the layout. Cabin log walls, animal statues, and a jukebox playing classic soul music. If you love The Lodge restaurant on Mt. Charleston, you will feel right at home here.   Our waitress was friendly, upbeat, and on point with her service.  I ordered the BBQ Western Bacon Burger well done, and I was in burger heaven. Our waitress brought ranch before I could ask for it! It was a great touch to their perfectly seasoned fries. My girlfriend ordered the Ribeye Steak Medium Rare. Sooo good!!   My only gripe is the Jim Carrey looking guy who helped ring us up. Before I finished paying, he was asking the waitress if the previous group had left a tip. Instead of asking her in the back, he thought it was best to openly shout across the restaurant. Not the best idea, but everything else was so good I'm willing to overlook it. No lie, I will definitely be back to try more off their menu!",

The broccoli and the chicken had a cheese sauce that was quite tasty.  I had a small salad (choice of soup or salad), the chicken, mashed potatoes, and grilled yellow and green squash rounds.  Dinner was quite good.  The service was outstanding!  Our server was very polite, friendly, and competent.  Even being from the smaller portions offerings, it was a lot to eat.  I like the ambiance of the place with all things bear - even the bear paw print on the napkins.  I wonder if anyone has ever counted the number of bears - stuffed or otherwise - that decorate almost every free space of the restaurant.  I'll be back!

I love the atmosphere of the place ~ made me and my boyfriend feel like we'd landed right in the middle of Colorado or Minnesota.   It's surrounded by plush bears and a decent upbeat mood.   The service was great - my boyfriend enjoyed his pancakes, and I got the usual salad.   I'd say more than anything the service was the best part of the whole experience.",

They serve up traditional diner food with generous portions. Prices are about the same as any other diner I've been to in town and are pretty reasonable for the amount of food you're getting. The service was decent despite the amount of people that were dining and there was constantly a line waiting to be seated. I would come again, but either earlier or later in the day to avoid the noon lunch rush",

I usually come here for dessert for their pies but one day asked the waitress about the fried chicken which was sold out for the day.  She got me hook-line-sinker and I was back the next week or two to order my fried chicken.  I wish i could take back that dreaded hour back of my life.   The fried chicken was awful - the breading on the skin fell off and it wasn't seasoned.   So much hype and a total bait and switch job.    I've been here about 6-7 times in the last couple years for breakfast (which they are more known for) and their pies so I'll give it 3 stars.   Just don't order the fried chicken.  BLAHHHHHHHHHH",

It helped that I received a $20 comp :) So we went & here's how things went down... You can't help but notice it's all seniors. I say this in a nice way because I love old folks & if they allowed me to live in their neighborhoods here I would so be into it! You see hundreds of bears everywhere (weird). The green carpet was stained everywhere (please replace your carpet). The booth we were sat in had a bright light above our heads that kept going on & off (felt like a bad version of EDC) with tons of old folk. So let's get to the food. Mediocre. I will say that the sizes were massive but unfortunately I didn't have the desire to finish anything. Everything felt so heavy that I felt guilty for hours afterwards.  The highlight was my freshly squeezed orange juice, it was the bomb!",

My go to is usually the Big Foot Chicken Fried Steak. It comes with a lot of food and you won't leave hungry. It comes with 2 biscuits which you can add sausage gravy to or I like to sometimes get 2 pancakes instead. We'll get to those later.  The chicken fried steak is a good size with country gravy on top. It also comes with eggs and potatoes. I usually get the hash browns extra crispy. These aren't The frozen hash browns. They are fresh potatoes sliced and fried into deliciousness.   Back to the pancakes. It's like having dessert after breakfast. They are sweet cream pancakes and are hearty. I'm not a fan of fluffy air pancakes. I like mine dense and hearty. These hit the spot.   They do have other good food as well. Their burgers are good and the fries are really good too. Their thousand island dressing tastes homemade.   Service can be hit or miss. Most of the time they are all friendly though. But I still give it a 5 stars.",

Neither one of us could eat all of it but we wanted to taste everything they offered on those two dishes. Breakfast was awesome! Everything was perfectly done especially the eggs which we both like over medium. The sweet cream pancakes are absolutely enormous and no way can you eat two of these at least we couldn't.  I chose the red diced cottage fries over the hashbrowns and was glad I did because they were superb!  This was our first visit there but we definitely will go back.  The service was outstanding and even though it was Sunday morning and every table was filled we were seated right away at a booth near the window-the only seating left. The place is bright, very clean  and cheerful looking and has a great ambience.  We decided this would be our new breakfast place because there are so many more things on the menu that we're going to try.  Definitely a five star review.",

    "text": "Perfectly good service in a busy diner. They've got this customer service thing down.   The quality of the food itself was a bit disappointing. I requested butter and whipped cream for my waffle, and discovered they only have butter \"alternative\" and synthetic whipped cream. It's a breakfast place with \"whipped cream\" on the menu quite a bit- they should get stuff that contains actual cream in my opinion. Fortunately, the waffle actually came from a fresh iron.  I ordered my eggs over medium, and they came out very runny and soft. I understand they are busy, but again, egg orders should be a strength of a breakfast diner.  I was happy with the service, and the price point. I'd likely actually stop here again when I'm in town, but I'd like to see some improvements to the authenticity of the ingredients.",

If you like Ranch dressing (on fries or whatever) I think theirs is one of the best. It's thick and creamy and has a robust buttermilk ranch flavor. If you're lucky enough to get seated in Angela's section then you'll really be well taken care of. Got the order exactly right, topped off fluids when they were nearing critically low levels and had a smile on her face and bounce in her step every time she visited our booth.   An all around great experience! 5 stars all the way.",

They build their restaurants to be reminiscent of  \"when life was a little more simple, and service and quality were the cornerstones of business.\" Its a great motto and they execute it very well. I have been driving past this place since I was 15 years old and it was ALWAYS busy. I felt, it was time to finally take the plunge and get in on the buzz. Boy am I sure glad we did!  The server was very polite even though she was extremely busy. She brought us coffee right away and took our order as soon as we decided. The one thing that I LOVE in my coffee is Splenda, which they(like so many other restaurants) didn't have. Not a huge deal, but i just hate sweet-and-low, and equal.. Yuckkk! Coffee was good though. Woke us right up! My son accidentally spilled his chocolate milk all over the table and our server was over at our table, super fast, with plenty of napkins to help.   I ordered the \"Volcano\" which came with \"Sweet Cream Pancakes\"(Which were excellent), Sausage links(fantastic! Tasted like homemade sausage), and crispy, delicious Bacon. Good portion size, but with the food being soo good, no portion size is going to help. This is a perfect place to have breakfast and fall back into the \"simple life\". We will definitely be back soon.",

It was amazing. The buttery, lightly toasted sourdough bread was stuffed with a savory shrimp salad and, of course, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. There was so much shrimp, it fell from the sandwich with every bite, still leaving plenty inside the bread. It was one of the most flavorful sandwiches I've ever had. On the side, was a cup of fresh cole slaw that was not too sweet and not too tart, but just right. I highly recommend this sandwich, but the Shrimp Specials will only be offered during the summer. So I may rush back to try the other shrimp plates!",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Biscuit Cornbread Homemade Bread Pudding with Pecan Praline sauce a la mode Cinnamon Roll French Toast Traditional Bear Claw Apple Pie  Unbeknownst to me a regional chain with over sixty locations throughout California and parts east an early morning stop at Black Bear Diner was prompted not only by a convenient location and inviting menu, but also by the promise of a 'dinner and a show' - in this case the traveling \"Chainsaws for Change\" crew cleaving blocks of wood into all sorts of shapes while I partook in a four part breakfast...plus a couple items to go.  Kitsch in decor with a pervasive log cabin theme speckled by bears both stuffed and carved it was to the tunes of the Four Tops that I entered Black Bear Diner and greeted first by a host behind the small pastry case and then by my server, Ray, the morning progressed in two courses with countless cups of coffee, the carving action outside visible through the windows while I dined.  Starting sweet and progressing sweeter it was to the flavor of custard-rich, ice cream crowned bread pudding that the meal began and rife with caramel, pecans, and raisins the steamy block proved surprisingly light while a duo of fresh baked breads with whipped butter and honey proved equally well done; the $0.99 cornbread toothsome and buttery while the $2.39 biscuit was so fluffy it literally flaked apart to the tooth.  Working slowly through the trio as wood chips flew it was only after the pudding was polished off that Ray put in my order for round-two and arriving piping hot the quartered cinnamon roll dressed in eggy batter and fried golden was superb, a light drizzle of cream cheese frosting mingling with the surprise of pure maple syrup into pure decadence - the sort of dish best taken with milk or coffee...and perhaps even better, shared.  At this point taking my leave and settling the bill it was with two additional items that I exited the cozy confines of the Black Bear and saving them until hours later suffice it to say that it was with some disappointment that I found the signature bear claw's pastry poorly laminated around pasty nut filling while the requested \"Cinnamon Apple Bavarian Cream Pie\" had been substituted by a standard, albeit delicious, traditional Apple Pie with a glossy butter crust instead - next time I guess I'll just have to enjoy all three courses at the table instead.",

I didn't eat it and she refused to take it off the bill.   I never went back. I live two blocks away and drive right past them when I eat out, which is several times a week.

They offer smaller portions too, but be prepared either way.   Their sweet cream pancakes are the biggest rave! I can't argue with that. They taste like birthday cake, minus the icing. Fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. The country fried steak is a must try! Hailing from the mid-west, a good fried steak is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They DO that here. They use the same technique with their hash browns. Add some Heinz 57 to them, you're in for treat.    Although located in a busy area and at times can be packed full of people, it's worth making the stop. The lumberjack-like atmosphere and teddy bears gives this place its name.

My friend has the opportunity to eat here for lunch with a few friends from her job and apparently enjoyed her lunch. Came over that night and told me I have to give this place a try. Well just this past weekend I was visiting in Vegas and one morning was looking for breakfast places. So I turned to Yelp  And what comes up in the search?? This place. So I decided  perfect time to try it. And I'm happy I did! Breakfast was delicious",

We ordered the:  Country Fried Steak - Didn't take a bite but was told it was ok but the hash brown potatoes were fire.  Parmesan Sourdough Cheeseburger - Nothing good or bad. Highly recommend mixing the ketchup and papa bear hot sauce together though.   It's probably the food snob in me but if you looking for a lot of food that's done decent and at a price point for everyone then this should be one of your top options.",

The second most important thing besides excellent customer service that is important to me when dining out is how fast I get my refill!! lol it may seem tedious. I shouldn't have to ask for a refill or wait longer than 5-10 minutes to get a refill.   Otherwise, great place to eat and great for kids!",

I ordered the New York Steak and Eggs with Country Potatoes and Sourdough toast. I happily ate the whole thing and I had to have more. I tried the chocolate lava cake with chocolate ice cream and it was amazing.  I was insanely impressed. My server William was amazing as well.  I will be coming back. Definately my new go to place.",

Our awesome waitress Marlene promptly ran off a list of non caffeinated drinks, I made a choice and a hassle free switch happened.   Man, as always my burger was on point. I love a place that understands medium RARE and doesn't over cook the beef. The onion rings and fries I stole from my girl were awesome too! Unfortunately no room for desert today which is a crime because i love the apple cobbler here! This place is really my favorite go-to place when we eat out. Never a disappointment and really consistently good from location to location. The one up near Sahara is just as good.",

Not only does it feel like you are in a log cabin in the mountains upon walking in, the service also screams family owned even though it's a large chain. Every time we've come (usually once a week) we've had Phenomenal customer service, the food is to die for for the low price point and comes in such large portions no matter how hungry you are you'll leave with a to go box and a full stomach. Shout out to Flower and Don for making today extra special for my Boyfriends birthday. We will definitely continue to be long time regulars.",

During the check in process a fellow customer was agitated that we stood in front of him while waiting for our table. It was crowded and we apologized for offending him and clarified that it was an accident. The rowdy customer then went BONKERS. He was clearly belligerent (drunk? on drugs? Who knows... The only thing that was clear was that this dude was out of his mind). He proceeded to make outlandish threats to my husband and I.   We immediately stepped away from this guy and we requested management to intervene. The manager advised us to calm down and  offered to sit us away from each other. Ummm...No thanks.  We were out of there lickity-split.   A batty customer ... Extremely poor management ... This whole thing was nutty! The lack of proper management for this random situation is inexcusable. I was very confused, scared and floored by the entire situation. I wanted no further part in the entire situation and we left promptly and went to Jamms and had a wonderful (drama free) breakfast.  One should feel safe in a restaurant and I will never step foot in that hole again. No way.. No how.. I understand they can't help their clientele. However, they clearly botched this all the way around. It was horrible, scary, and I want no part in anything like that ever again!",

The entire team reminds me of Texas Southern Hospitality.  I've lived in Las Vegas for 3 years+ and their hospitality keeps me coming back!  I've traveled all across the USA and eaten at thousands of restaurants, and their Sweet Cream Pancakes are amazing and the best I've ever had!  I highly recommend adding a pancake as a side if your dish doesn't come with it!  You will have a great eating experience if you come here!  Thanks to the Black Bear Staff for their years of dedication to amazing customer service!",

I arrived between normal mealtimes and was seated as soon as I arrived, even though the restauraunt was reasonably busy.  The server was awesome.  She was friendly, knew the menu cold, and when I asked her what she liked, wasn't shy in telling me but without being pushy or trying to be persuasive.  I really respected that about her.  (I ordered the \"Gobbler\" sandwich, one of her favorites, on sourdough bread, btw, and it fully lived-up to her recommendation.)  Oh, and the fries were so good that I ate all of them, even though I shouldn't have eaten so many (there was a mountain of hot, delicious fries on my plate, so what's a girl to do?).  The food was reasonably priced (lunch was $14 and change -plus tip- for a sandwich, lots of fries, and a bottomeless soda.  Service was some of the best I've ever had in family-style restaurant.  And there was plenty of parking.  Overall, the Black Bear Diner was a good experience and I'll be back.",

Also, the kind of woodsy feel ties it all together perfectly. Their menu is rather interesting, it's a print of an old newspaper. On the inside is the actual menu. I have my personal favorites including the grizz breakfast and bobs big bear burger deluxe. I also really enjoy their side salad served with mm bacon ranch. I have had a number of other things from their menu that were sensational. The price isn't bad for anything either, especially for the amount of food they give you. By far my favorite menu item is their pancakes. I usually don't care for pancakes and almost never eat them when they are on the side from another breakfast place. Butttt black bears pancakes are unbelievable! They are soft, but thick. They are sweet but still really good with syrup. Mmmmm my mouth is watering thinking about them.  If you're looking for a place to take the kids, or really anyone, I would strongly suggest black bear.",

Certainly no complaints with the service.  Decor was fine and typical for the theme they were going for (lodge/bear type feel)  I ordered chicken fried steak which came with 2 eggs, and hasbrowns and my coffee which came to $10.00  Chicken fried steak was good but not great (Blueberry hill has the best country fried steak), the gravy was good, hasbrowns were good.   Their biscuit was huge and only had a tiny bite and didn't care for it,   I was disappointed though for $10 for breakfast especially here in vegas, all breakfasts should come with bacon or sausage and pancakes.  A side of any of this was at minimum $3  Their portions were huge but remember, bigger portions doesn't mean it's a better breakfst.  I've had smaller portions at dennys but for the same money I got more food because I got a main item, eggs, hashbrowns, bacon AND sausage AND pancakes AND coffee for UNDER $10  So on that little point, they can't compete with other places.  Overall food was alright, not great, certainly not bad by any means. I would go back, but wouldn't go out of my way to go there specifically though.",

My BF had the waffle and a side of bacon with a hot chocolate, the waffle was ok, the hot chocolate seemed watered down he had to add some sugar to it even though they served it to him in a sloppy cup which dripped all over the table he still enjoyed it, I personally didn't like the fact that they served him the cup like that with whipped cream running down the cup onto the table but thats just me, other than that the food was good, I do have to say the young lady I believe was the host needs a little clean up her self, her hair was sloppy and she looked like she didn't wanna be there, ok Im done.",

When I walked in, the first impression I had was of a small town diner where you see the old men sitting around, telling each other stories over coffee: inviting and comfortable.  The menu is interesting. Setup in the style of a 1940's newspaper, the vast menu covers all areas of down-home cooking.  I had the Country Fried Steak and eggs with country potatoes. Steak was great and the cream gravy really pleased. Eggs were ok. The wife got the California Omelet and really enjoyed it. Fresh veggies and huge chunks of avocado. The kid ordered the child's chocolate-chip pancakes with powdered sugar. Pretty sure there was more chip then cake, which pleased to no end.  Priced low for the amount and quality of the food.

    "text": "I haven't eaten here in a few years and thought it would be a good place to bring the kids for brunch. The hostess told us approximately 25 min wait and she crossed off our name by accident after I inquired 22 minutes and haven't heard her call and people behind us already sat down. So I'm kinda annoyed at this point and hope the rest of the experience would be good to make up for it. We get sat and did get drinks fairly quickly. We ordered 2 kids meals (burger, chicken fingers, fries) and 2 Eggs Benedict (Huevos Rancheros, California Bacon Avocado). The food took a long time (35 minutes). The waitress was not very attentive. She did not check on us or let us know food was almost done. After food came out she did not ask if we needed anything like tobasco or anything. The food was fairly good. The poached eggs were cooked correctly. It was nice it came with a little bowl of fresh fruit and choice of hash browns or homestyle. The waitress did not check if the food was okay. When we were done she asked if we wanted anything else. I saw on the menu earlier the kids meals came with a sundae. So I had to remind her about it. She was like oh yeah it does. I think if I didn't know she would have pretended not to know so she wouldn't have to bring it. The fresh squeezed OJ was cheap quality and tasted like it was diluted and sugar was added. They charge $5 per glass. Skip it. Sad to say but I will not be returning to this diner as the food and decor/atmosphere was not bad. But ultimately it comes down to service and ours was not up to par.",

    "text": "I went there yesterday for the first time after my husband recommended it. I ordered the fresh squeezed OJ which cost 5 dollars but they squeeze it fresh with the machine right there, or so they say.  When I tasted the OJ, I knew it wasn't fresh because I drink fresh squeezed OJ daily.  After asking the server over again, she finally came clean and said they only squeeze it in the morning because they \"don't have time\".  We were there at noon.  Not sure why it would take so much time to plop a couple of oranges into the machine and then press the button.  Anyway, then I ordered my breakfast meal with the meat on the side as I am vegetarian, (meat for hubby). When the meal came all my food was on top of the meat  (I had asked for on the side) that was right in the middle of the plate.  When I showed this to the server she said they had a new cook and blamed it on him. But, the server took my order and should have checked it when she picked it up. Why blame the cook, just like she has no time to get the fresh squeezed OJ that they advertise. I was very upset to say the least and we let the manager know.  He was very concerned and really wanted to make up for it and gave us half off our bill which was 35.00 for 2 people ordering breakfast.  I think the manager should find servers that know how to do their job and not harm the business that so kindly employed them.",

We were greeted by friendly staff and seated quickly.  Our server was friendly and attentive. Between us we tried pancakes, eggs benedict, an omelet and a traditional breakfast combo plate. None of us were disappointed in the least.  Each dish was generous, attractively presented and totally YUM.

The place is cutely decorated with stuffed bears all through out and a couple bear statutes before you even walk inside.  What I like about Black Bear is unlike Eggworks or Cracked Egg it wasn't as crowded and seating felt more comfortable and not as tight.  The menu had your basic breakfast items.  If you are trying to eat healthy they offer Fit and Focused Scrambles for under 500 calories,   And I don't know how healthy the 7-grain granola nut cakes are but they had an interesting nutty flavor to them and I like them better then regular pancakes.  They also offer sugar free syrup.  The waitress suggested the two stack for three of us and it was plenty to split.  Portions are very generous.  Service was good!

    "text": "I have to say, my experience was bear-riffic!!!  Black Bear Diner, was pretty much easy to find.  On the corner of Tropicana and Jones, you can see it right off the road.  The location, is a good location to find this diner.  From the looks of it, it has that wilderness look and a set of wooden bears outside, which I thought it was cute, but of course that wasn't the only cute thing about it.  Walking inside, we were greeted promptly and was seated right away.  The really cute part of it, is all these stuff bears all around you.  Kind of brings back the childhood days, when I had a stuff bear.  It really put a smile on my face to think that.    We went there, early lunch, which I had my doubts on service.  Cause usually when its the beginning of lunch, I usually assume slow service.  But it was a bit surprising that it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be and the service was prompt.  From the point we were seated to a waitress asking what we would like to drink, was just a matter of seconds.  I was very impress that they were ready and willing to take our orders.  Unfortunately I wasn't ready and needed a minute, but after I was done and put down my menu, there was our waitress, who is ready to take our order.  Well, she was talking to another customer, but really surprise that she came to our table right away, after the fact that I just put down the menu.    I was debating on the Taco Salad or New York Steak.  They both sound good and tasty, but decided to go with the New York steak and eggs.  I'm sure the Taco Salad, would of been great, but I'm glad that I went with the steak.  It was well done to my satisfaction and presented very well.  I basically ate the whole thing, and a slice of toast.  Hoping I would of went with dessert, but I was full and satisfied with the steak.  I'm sure dessert would of been great.    Over all, I was very satisfied with my visit, and recommend this to anyone who is very hungry, like  a bear.  Even though, you may not be hungry like a bear, you got to check this place out.  Sure enough, you will not be disappointed.  Especially if you love plush bears on the ceiling, that got to put a smile on your face at least.",

    "text": "I write this review purely on their breakfast options. I have never tried lunch or dinner options. They have hands down the best omelets in Las Vegas. I have tried other breakfast options which are good but the omelets keep me coming back. They are that good. The cook is nearly always excellent and delivers the best tasting omelets and hash browns.  I switch between wheat and sourdough toast. I have opted for the fresh fruit before but they tend to put flavor full fruit on top of rind flavored fruit chunks. Flower (hostess?) and Marlene to me are the power duo. I have always had good , prompt and friendly service here but those two are the shining stars in my opinion. There are bear decorations all over the place and a jukebox kicking out older tunes . A very home cooked meal and small cafe feel kind of place. I was shocked to find out it was a chain since everything seemed to perfect to be a chain. The pies and shakes are the only other items I have tried (to go) and they are quiet flavorful. They are about the size of a Marie Calendars pot pie but filled with sweet tooth goodness. I only wish they would have a Peach Cobbler that wasn't flavored with splenda as I despise fake sugars.  The other cobblers (Apple, Blackberry ) were very good. They also have Banana, Chocolate and Coconut creme pies if that is more your style. The Cinnamon rolls are massive and look very tempting  but I am always so  haven't tried one yet. Totally worth a trip across town for.",

    "text": "Only giving this place 2 stars because the food was just ok and comparable to ihop but nothing spectacular. My wife and I visited here the first time today for breakfast and we'd decided to share the grizz before even getting there. Upon arrival it seemed pretty busy in the parking lot and when we walked in it didn't feel comfortable. As an African couple the first thing we noticed was the patrons were all Caucasian, not an issue but we wanted to give it the benefit of doubt since the reviews were favorable. We were immediately greeted and sat at a booth where a waitress took our drink order and told us our waitress would be there in a few. Since we already knew what we wanted there was no need to look at the menu. About 7 minutes later our waitress named Candy arrives after tending to a few other tables and asked for our order in a very dry and forced tone. I didn't get a friendly or good service vibe by the tone of her voice, more of a \"you were sat here and I have to wait on you\" vibe. As a former waiter I've worked with people like her and know how the game goes. We ordered the grizz and just sat and observed how Candy treated all of her surrounding tables, she was friendly and gave casual conversation. Until she brought out our food was the next time she came to us. No type of check in like \"your food is coming soon\" \"how's everything tasting\" NOTHING!! We asked for a second syrup and she said ok 5 mins later I had to flag her down for it and it was obviously she forgot or ignored it bc she didn't apologize for not bringing it the first time. All in all we didn't feel welcome at black bear by Candy and it felt like we weren't deserving of the service she gave her other tables. Maybe because no other guest there had our skin color is the only reason I can think of. Customer service is top priority in the restaurant industry and we did not receive that at black bear. We will never return or recommend.",

Service- The waitress we had gave service like a robot...not very personable to the point she seemed pissed off.

I have rarely finished a meal there, which is not a bad thing since I love leftovers. The menu is huge, the portions are huge but the cost is reasonable.   This place smokes Denny's for breakfast and they put IHOP's pancakes to shame.  I have eaten at black bear too many times to count but occasionally I have I had a bad meal at black bear, but that would be 1 out of 100 maybe.   Worth noting  is the variety of breakfast meats you can get. In addition to the usual bacon, sausage, ham they also serve chorizo, linquica, corned beef, ground beef and tri tip dishes.   I only have two small nit picks. First I wish they had more then one location in Vegas, (HINT HINT I hope your listening Black Bear, put one up north!). Second I wish they would go back to their old steak fries. What they serve now is just not as good their old ones which were the bomb. Regardless of my small complaints they deserve all 5 stars.",

From the chainsaw carved statues outside to the teddy bears lining the walls, there is even a little carved bear near the register you can have a \"Kodiak\" moment with.   I had the meal tittled \"The Grizz\" and for 9.99 it was a sweet deal of two sausages, two strips of bacon, three eggs, a piece of ham, choice of potatoes and two pancakes. While the meat was good and the pancakes were really fluffy, the potatoes were a little bland. A couple shakes of the salt and a squirt of ketchup took care of that. The coffee was also very rich and I loved that the table came stocked with flavored creamers.   I wish this place was a little closer to home because I'd be here every week. There are so few decent places for breakfast in this town and this place just rocks. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. I am a cinnamon roll junkie and as I was leaving I spied one in the front case bigger than my face. I'll be back to conquer one of those bad boy. I've got a new favorite breakfast place. I can only imagine the rest of the menu is just as awesome.",

Well.... we can see why everyone gets the CFS.  The bacon was like beef jerky.  Too chewy.  Not crispy.  The biscuit minus gravy was a bit dry.  Even butter wasn't enough to moisten it.  Gravy is the only solution.  The homemade corned beef has was meh.  It was just shredded corned beef brisket with some potatoes.  They need to grill the hash so it's has more crisp.  The hash browns are also a bit soggy.  A small amount of crisp, but not enough to want to finish the hash browns.  The sweet cream pancakes were very sweet.  Tasted like angel food cake batter was used to make the pancakes.   I didn't realize this place was a chain.  I thought it was a local mom and pop shop.  Now I realize the CFS was something special that got me to come back, but the bacon being like jerky is something that would make me not come back.   A disappointing 2 stars for the sequel to this story.",

    "text": "Ever since we found one of these while visiting our property up in Reno, this is our \"go to\" place for weekend breakfasts. Although this is a franchise business, it never feels that way. The owner/manager is always by the front till, greeting the customers and welcoming them to the establishment. The portions are large without being obnoxious and the food is usually pretty good. We only come for breakfast, so we can't comment on their other meals.  The place is usually packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, but don't let all the people standing around waiting scare you off. They turn tables rather quickly and the wait usually isn't more than 10 to 15 minutes. If you bring kids, there are plenty of stuffed bears and other bear related items that can keep them occupied while you wait. One word of advice--if you go on Sunday, try to get there before the local church services end. It seems like that this is the place people like to come after church and the wait can be up to 45 minutes.  Once seated, the service has always been top-notch. No matter how busy the place is, the servers always seem to have a smile on their face and make you feel like you're their most important customer. We've been coming here for years and it doesn't look like they have a lot of turnover in the front of house so the workers must enjoy the atmosphere. It's usually no more than a minute or two before you have your menu and the waitress is ready to take your drink order. Their coffee is good and we'd recommend their fresh squeezed orange juice. Unless you know exactly what you want for breakfast, the drinks will be there before you're done reading through the menu.  I mostly order one of their three egg omelets (the California or I'll choose my own ingredients). No problems with substitutions here. The omelets come with hash browns which have always been crispy on the outside and warm and moist on the inside. My only complaint would be that the hash browns are under seasoned, which could be good if you're on a low sodium diet. I'll include a side of their sausage links to add a bit of meat to my meal. The links have just the right amount of seasoning to have that sausage bite without being overpowering. They are large, fresh and juicy instead of the small, wrinkled ones that have been sitting under a heat lamp that you get in some of the larger chains. Their buttermilk pancakes are large and fluffy and have never been over or undercooked. If you don't think you can eat the full meal, try ordering from their \"Little Less\" menu. The omelets are made with two eggs instead of three and all the portions are a bit smaller.  The bad part about this place is that it's out west Tropicana which is a bit of a drive for us. We wish they'd open one somewhere in the northwest, although then we'd be eating here more than we probably should.",

My local friend said the breakfast they serve is oversized if you want.  Some oversized people up in here too.  I got a kick out of the large bear carvings inside and out.  The waitresses also make fresh o.j. with the machines sitting right in the dining area.  What a trip.",

There we were greeted by another friendly waitress. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs, and the better half ordered a Pancake breakfast. My meal also came with a biscuit and hashbrowns. The Biscuit was light as air, and I ordered it covered in gravy (my heart will thank me later). I normally skip the hashbrowns, as most are just cooked enough to pass as edible, this order however was fantastic, most of the hashbrowns were actually brown, and crispy just the way I love them. the Chicken fried steak was so tender that I could cut it with my fork, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I tried the better half's pancakes, and bacon both were fantastic. overall I was ecstatic on our choice to venture out off the strip, and I look forward to my next visit",

This place is great!  There are a ton of breakfast options, small portions, large portions.  The menu is on a newspaper with actual articles from back in the day. Ours was from 1986. It was nice being able to read some history from back then.  I ordered the 7 grain nut pancakes, eggs, and bacon, while he ordered the huge chicken fried steak that came w/ hash browns or diced red potatoes w/ onions and pappers, eggs, and choice of toast, biscuit, or ...?? something else. The food came out promptly....maybe 10-15 minutes max.  I don't know if coffee was something i really needed that morning or not, but it was super good for some reason!  (I was sober.)   Every staff member there was extremely friendly and perky!  That is so nice to see that they really do care and are not putting on an act just to make some money.  We'll definitely be back.",

Service was good-not exceptional.  One member of our party cannot eat onions or garlic.  He requested his steak without onions, but he meal not only came with onions, so did his salad.  The waiter took it back and likely just had all the onions removed instead of having it remade.   Portions were large and everything tasted good.  I heard the corn muffins were good--I didn't get a chance to try it.  I would recommend this restaurant for families for the decent quality and value.",

My Dad ordered the Big foot which was a large chicken fried steak with eggs, potatoes and biscuits. It was wonderful, everything a chicken fried steak should be. I ordered the eggs Benedict and was disappointed by the overcooked egg yolk and the consistency of the hollandaise sauce. This is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars.",

All I can remember is that I had a big portion of comfortable and tasty breakfast meal with a strong cup of coffee( I enjoy drinking bold in the morning). I decided to try it again on one Sunday morning.  When I walked in, it was a full house! I waited about 5 min and got a table.  I knew what I wanted,,, Omelette, Omelette, & Omelette :)   *My Happy Meal of the Dayyy:   1. South of the Border Omelette-seasoned ground beef OR chorizo with ortega chilies, jack cheese, avocado and homemade salsa, served with a flour tortilla. Choice of strip-cut hash browns OR red diced potatoes($8.99): I had the chorizo and the red potatoes..   2. Coffee with vanilla cream and sugar: It was bold & smooth.   Well, I really enjoyed my meal. The service was provided promptly by friendly waitress. The portion was HUGE that I had to take some home. There was no cut-off time for ordering breakfast here. I prefer real all day breakfast places for a late breakfast( I am pretty much a late riser on weekends). I noticed that a full service menu is offered for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I'll definitely give them another shot. Nowadays, I can't seem to find very many good hole in the wall, mom and pop owned places to have a breakfast in LV. It is definitely a chain world out here in the city! Sad, really....However, The Black Bear Diner serves up some good home cooking :) There are no strangers here at the Black Bear - only friends you haven't met yet :P",

(just kidding about those last two)  The interior is chock full of bear decorations as the name suggests. It reminded me of the diners I used to frequent in Upstate New York with my great-grandparents as a child. Upon entering on a busy Friday night, the three of us were quickly seated. I opted for 'The Grizz', their breakfast special which includes two pancakes, bacon, a small ham steak, two sausages, three eggs prepared to your liking, and choice of potatoes. Along with this Ron Swanson approved meal, I got a cup of their delicious house coffee to wash it all down. Everything was completely satisfactory as far as my meal went. Our waitress was on her game and all of the food items came out cooked to perfection, which is really all you can ask for in a basic meal such as this. The prices were reasonable enough and we all left with a stuffed bellies and smiles on our faces.",

It's a family friendly restaurant and I'm not sure if the southern accents are real but they're cute. We were seated immediately but it was about 9 on a Wednesday so I can't tell you for sure if they ever get super busy but I have a feeling they do. The location is about 4 miles from where we stayed off the strip so it's not a terrible drive.  The hostess who sat us didn't really help us much because we hadn't been there and we were confused as to why we didn't get menus but they are in the paper (actual newspaper looking) she sat us with. So that was cute.  We ordered the classic eggs benedict and the country fried steak. Both super delicious. Hand down the best chicken fried steak because the batter is so light and you can cut the steak with the butter knife. Anthony chose to have a biscuit with his meal which was light and fluffy and delicious with both butter and jelly. My eggs benedict we delicious and I had never had it with slices of ham instead of a ham steak and that was yummy because I got more ham with my bite. They also come with a bowl of fruit and hash browns which were crispy on top and fluffy in the middle.  Both dishes were delicious and we can definitely see ourselves coming back.",

The inside might be lined with stuffed animals like your grandmas house or little sisters room but don't let any of that fool you. This place is solid.    So I ordered The Volcano breakfast. 3 pancakes (made with sweet cream), 2 pieces of bacon, scrambled eggs with cheese and a sausage patty. The pancakes were great and the bacon was cooked to order. The sausage is made at the restaurant and has a nice taste and my eggs were hot and good. It was a nice pile of food for $8. Our waitress was very good and even stopped to talk to us about the restaurant and some of the popular things on the menu.   OH YEAH..... check out the humongous bear claws they have in the glass case as you walk in.",

The Big Foot chicken fried steak plate is huge and good enough for two to share.  the Bread Pudding is great, even better with vanilla ice cream! It's topped off with warm Pecan Praline sauce, and as the ice cream slowly melts combining with the sauce, it then becomes a whole new creamy thick buttery sweet goodness and is absorbed into the bread pudding = a spoonful of decadent creamy bread pudding deliciousness, mmmm",

She took the time to answer all our questions and never let my coffee cup go empty. The coffee by the way was delicious! The menu was on newspaper and there are stories also on it telling the (you are allowed to keep it) story of BBD and other stuff. Most of the food on the menu is made from scratch and it says you can customize your order any way that you like and if they can do it, they will.  I ordered from their \"little less\" menu which has smaller portions. It was still enough to fill me! For $6.99 I had 1 egg, 2 pieces of bacon, hash browns and sourdough toast. The egg was cooked just the way I ordered it, the bacon had great flavor, the hash browns were too tasty and the sourdough toast was great! Something simple as breakfast is easy to mess up, but they do it right here. I also ordered a \"Bear Claw\" priced at $4.49 however I was too stuffed from breakfast to tackle that big boy! Cindi packed it to-go for me and said to just pop it in the microwave for 25-30 seconds before I'm ready to eat it. She also said the bear claws are made at each location daily! That bear claw made for one mighty fine dessert :)  Lunch and dinner is also served here at BBD. I have no doubt it is probably tasty, but I'm sure this will me more of a breakfast spot for me since I enjoyed that so much.",

Things got off to a rough start when we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated on a Monday morning, however I'll take in consideration it was a holiday weekend that was just finishing up. When we finally got seated, it took the waitress almost 20 minutes to take our order. Before that, she had apologized profusely to let us know that they were short-staffed and that there were six other people ahead of us before she would even be able to take our order. About another 40 minutes later, we finally got our breakfast and my order was messed up. I ordered the biscuits and gravy with sausage I instead got bacon,  I didn't bother letting the waitress know because it would have probably taken another 20 minutes to get some sausage. My husband had ordered white toast and it wasn't until we got our order that we were told they ran out of white toast.  seriously who runs out of white toast for friggin breakfast time?    overall id say the food was average. I couldn't really say it was fantastic because we waited so long to eat. There was a couple who sat near us and by the time they got their food their eggs were cold and they got up and just left the Good! Which is crazy to me  because we were all waiting so long to eat anyway.",

My family of four had a hard time finishing even 3/4 of all our dishes.  We had to forgo the bear claw, although I regret that now. Sign up for their e-mail list to get a free coffee and bear claw! But you need to sign up a few days before because it takes at least 24 hours for the e-mail to come through.  I'd skip the breakfast buffets and make the detour here.

We tried coming here before but the line was out the door and we didn't want to wait.  My Mom and I ordered the Sirloin steak and eggs breakfast, my kids shared some chocolate pancakes and my husband had the california club. I can honestly say the food was \"ok.\"   Let me emphasize everything around me before I get to the food rating. When we first walked in, there were about 5 tables occupied (not a lot) BUT there was only 1 waitress so including us, that was a lot to 1 waitress. The atmosphere is cute, full of bears everywhere and we were able to sit anywhere we wanted. The waitress didn't need to write down our order, she memorized every detail to our order. WOW! I was impressed since there was a lot of small requests she had it down. I watched her zoom her way around catering to each table, she was really good at her job! Not only that, she was attentive and very fast to getting plates in the back. She's a friendly fireball!   Let's get down to the food, my husband and kids loved their food. My Mom and I both had a room temp plate. Maybe it was just sitting in the back too long while my husband and kids food was being made. Our steak was bland so we had to use some A1 sauce, its actually not A1 but Black Bears version of it, it was too tart. Wasn't too pleased with my food.  I know they could have done better, I don't know if they were short staffed in the morning but the waitress really held it down for the restaurant. Even the manager gave a balloon to each of my boys. Sweet! I'm gonna give this place the benefit of the doubt, cuz I know there is still potential in my steak and eggs breakfast lol I'm taking away 1 star for that BUT, I do like everything else about this place. I didn't get the waitresses name, but that girl needs a raise!",

    "text": "Warning! If you suffer from Ursaphobia(fear of the bear) do not visit this restaurant. This is one of those themed based restaurants which gives reverence to the \"Black Bear\". They have bear carvings, 100s of stuffed bears, bear hot sauces, etc. I visit this restaurant often because they serve generous portions of freshly made food. I typically go here for breakfast, I have ventured out into the lunch portion of the menu only twice so my review is basically for breakfast. If you are tired of the other restaurants trying to sell you their orange juice as \"fresh squeezed \" then try this place. I hate when I restaurant tries to pass off orange juice from jugs delivered to their location as being freshly squeezed. That's just False advertisement. Black Bear has freshly squeezed orange juice which is made on the premises. The machine can be seen in the left corner as you walk in to the restaurant.  I usually get the freshly made corned beef hash, hash browns and a biscuit with gravy. This place not only makes the corned beef hash fresh but also the hash browns are also freshly shredded . One of the few places in town that I'm aware of that makes their own hash browns. I have also tried the Joe's Hobo omelette a couple of times.  For lunch I enjoyed the hot turkey dinner with mashed red potatoes and sauteed vegetables. The turkey is nicely sliced white meat with ample portions. I've never left this place hungry.  The one day I would stay away from here is on Sunday. The regular manager was not here on a Sunday I dropped by here recently. I must say, the place was not very well run on his day off. The manager that day definitely seemed confused and overwhelmed. The other recommendation I would make is to try to stay in the main dining room. The only times I have had slow service was when I have been seated in the side room.",

You do get big portions, but the food just isn't great.  It doesn't taste fresh, and it wasn't cooked with particular care.  The stuffed animals inside seem like huge dust collectors.  The booth had no padding, so unless you balanced very carefully, your behind was on wood struts under the seat and nothing else.  I feel bad saying this, but it didn't seem much different than Denny's, just bigger portions.  The service was nice, if not present often, and it has a homey ambiance.  It just wasn't great.",

    "text": "I love me some breakfast, but given the ability to choose between all the meals of the day is a winner. My friend and I decided to give this place a try after a few unsuccessful attempts. Finally getting out here and looking at the menu, lunch won out.   I got the tri-tip dip with a green salad. The cuts of meat are thick and generous without being jaw dislocating. With three large slices of perfectly seasoned beef, grilled onions and mushrooms, it was perfect. The vegetables were not drowned in oil and the roll was not soaked through. The tri-tip was cooked to a medium/medium-well. I normally prefer medium rare, so next time I will request it and see if they offer that option. The green salad was standard. My friend got the hobo omelet and you have to be starving to finish it. It is a gigantic monster stuffed and topped with bacon, sausage, ham, spinach, onion, and cheese. The red potato chunks are tender, not too salty, but not crispy. It comes with a bread as well. He got the biscuit. They are big, not dense and light.  Both entrees cost around nine dollars. We were shocked by how generous the portions were for the price and that it tasted good too. I could not finish the meal without getting a blackberry sundae. Even though I was full, I cannot resist the cold stuff especially if it is topped with berries. They give a large scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with warm blackberries. Instead of doing a compote, when heated, the berries release their juices to create a sauce. As the ice cream melts and melds with the fresh fruit and whipped cream, it is heaven.   This is a nice place to have a relaxing meal. The only thing that is rushed is the food. The kitchen and staff are quick to deliver without making you feel like you have to shove it down and get out.",

The fourth had the waffle with chicken and said it was great.  The waffle was huge and had a paw print on it to go with the bear theme throughout the restaurant.  The two children ate from the kids menu and loved their dinners and their ice cream for dessert.  Smaller versions of the meals are available, and these are also large portions.  Diners are not charged an extra plate fee if they choose to share a meal.  To go boxes are readily available.  I would suggest getting a to go box and saving room for dessert.  We had the bread pudding, sugar bears lava cake, and the banana split cream pie.  All were delicious and HUGE portions that were perfect for sharing.  We discussed coming back with a large group and ordering one of every dessert just so we could taste each one.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is great, and the atmosphere is family oriented.  We will definitely be back!  It would be nice to see a Black Bear Diner open on the NW end of Las Vegas so we don't have to drive so far for fabulous food.  :)",

Don't let the parking lot fool you - i've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.    Eggs are cooked perfectly.  Chicken fried steak (one of my favorites when I am there) is dead-on.

No can here, just shredded brisket fried up with just a little potato and onion. Delish. Also tried the Blueberry Sweet Cream pancakes which were simply fabulous. Service was very good, everyone smiling and giving a welcoming feeling even when they were getting slammed. Waitress was helpful and they gladly made the substitutions I inquired about.

    "text": "I am writing this review based on their Rib Eye Steak Dinner for $14.99.  Food:  I am not sure why I thought that they would have a good steak, since most diners are known for their breakfast, sandwiches and shakes (should have just went for a shake....), but I still ordered the steak anyway.  Their steak was absolutely disgusting! The worst steak I have ever had in my life (even worse than the overcooked, slightly burnt ones from my ex boyfriend). It was extremely hard to cut through, especially since it was so thin. It was mainly gristle, and no meat. It had so much fat, very bland, and dry.   It came with an assortment of mixed vegetables (broccoli, squash, zucchini, and onions) which were the best thing on the plate!  Their salad plate was warm, and the salad was literally lettuce, two dime size onions, two warm tomatoes, two cucumbers, and some carrots. There were no croutons, cheese, and their was barely any onions. They were also out of their gluten-free Honey Dijon dressing (which was aggravating).  I really wanted this Diner to work out, but it didn't.   First Impression:  The outside makes it look somewhat like a lodge. The inside is just a ridiculous, tacky assortment of fake stuffed teddy bears ( in all different sizes!).  I don't know what type of look they were going for... but when I think of a lodge, I think of walls covered with dead animals, and huge stuffed bears with big teeth (not a little beanie baby....??)  Service:  The server was nice, and we tipped her 20% on our bill for $35.00. Food was delivered fast, since we were basically the only ones in there.  ...........",

    "text": "I really, REALLY wanted to like this place.  How can you hate on a place that is decorated with teddy bears?  Seriously now... I'm like an overgrown she-child, so this place should have been paradise for me.  Instead, I left with a bad taste in my mouth, both literally and figuratively.  It took us ten minutes to be seated.  The woman at the cash register up front wasn't the hostess (I guess), so she left to find someone to seat us.  We waited FOR-E-VER for someone to finally show us to a table.  Then, we sat for another ten minutes after deciding what we wanted to eat for someone to come take our order.  I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup to start.  It was tepid at best and exactly the same consistency and overwhelmingly salty flavor as Campbell's Chunky soup.  For my meal, I ordered pot roast.  Over 50% of it was fat.  The sides were pretty nasty as well... a hard and cold baked potato and burned vegetables.  My fiance's turkey dinner was so bad that he left it untouched like it was an alien life form.    The service was the worst part.  From start to finish, the waitress was surly and rude.  It was like we were ruining her day by just being there.  I really, REALLY tried to be nice, but it seemed like she was more mean the nicer I got.  I couldn't WAIT to bolt out of there.  Seriously, people.  There are better diners in this city.  Maybe I had a random bad experience, but besides the decor, there was nothing I liked about this place.",

Uhm I don't want to clean a dead bug while I'm trying to eat. I was really grossed out and I thought it was inhospitable of the hostess to make me clean it up for her while I'm eating.",

Anything I've ordered has always been tasty and well prepared.  I ordered the bacon deluxe burger today and it was great, although I have to admit that burger is way too big for the average human to consume.  The bacon they used on it was really flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Any time I've ordered any breakfast items they have been great as well. The staff is friendly and do a professional job. The prices are about what I would expect from a diner/coffee house. Overall they do a good job and serve good food.",

The food was very good with huge servings, but.... Cindy, our server, began cheery and friendly but ended up not meeting our needs. We look over their super, cute newspaper menu and decide what each of us want to order, she takes our orders, but before she leaves to put the order in, she all of the sudden remembers that the biscuits won't be ready for 20 minutes! :( WHAT?! A few of us had ordered the biscuits and gravy, now we have to re-order! :( So, she brings out the order, well.... \"most\" of the food...a few of us had to wait an additional 5 minutes for our food (didn't order anything special). Something was cooked incorrectly (cooks fault) so now that person has to wait another TEN minutes for their food. It was ridiculous!        NOTE: There were 7 adults, no kids, no unreasonable demands on food preparation....it just wasn't an good experience for us at this location; however, we would still HIGHLY recommend visiting a (different location) Black Bear Diner!

It was hard to choose what I wanted to eat because there were so many tempting items. I got the Bigfoot Chicken fried steak and it comes with soup or salad and a corn bread muffin I chose a salad with ranch which I must say was very tasty ranch and the muffin was so sweet and soft. You also get a choice of sides I  ordered the red skinned mashed potatoes and baked beans let me tell you I have never had baked beans that good they were sweet and spicy and had sausage and bacon in them mmm mmm good. Now on to the main dish the chicken fried steak it was tasty fried goodness covered in homemade gravy the meat was very good quality this is definitely the best chicken fried steak I have ever had.  Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the service was excellent and the price was right.  I cant wait to return to this restaurant there are so many other delicious looking items I wanna try.",

My daughter was getting breakfast for dinner and I was going to get a steak. When the waitress came over and told us the special was a fish fry, all you can eat, I decided to get that instead. My daughters meal was great but my fish was like just breading. It was the thinnest fish I have ever seen \"or not seen\". They need to either get thicker fish or put two or three off them together so you can taste the fish. Will not order this again. If I do I will ask to see a piece first before ordering.

    "text": "Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.     Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.  Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.  A Yelper's growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.  Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.  A Yelper's growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear's Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.  Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.  A Yelper's growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear's Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.  Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don't be afraid to take leftovers home!  A Yelper's growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up.   Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.  A Yelper's growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level.   Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.  A Yelper's growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.  ***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. This is review 90***",

ScramBOWL: This was a mix of everything in here plus a nice big biscuit that comes with it. BF said it was pretty good. I tried it was yummy. Packed with lots of flavor.  California Bacon Benedict: I'm a Benny person, probably one of my favorite breakfast items, i don't need to say much but this was on point   I feel bad but I forgot our server's name. He was very helpful, polite and didn't crowd. He was a good mix of giving us our space and checking in on us. The rest of the staff were kind as well.

My bacon and eggs were good but I did not care for their pancakes. The pancakes were very sweet; too sweet for me. The pancakes were too fluffy. They fell apart when I put my spoon through it. They actually melted in your mouth. On the other hand my husband ordered the Fiesta scramble with red potatoes and his food was pretty good. I give his breakfast a 3 1/2 star. Our meal came up to 33 dollars and some change. I will need to revisit this place, order something else, and review it again. Remember, this is just my opinion on my breakfast; I am sure that there are other things on the menu that taste great.",

The restaurant had maybe 6 tables, it was 8:30 pm on Monday 24 April.   After the remodel I would think the staff would be on their A game to win back the customers that went somewhere else to eat during the weeks that they were closed.   I will not be back, they lost a loyal customer. Sad",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try Black Bear Diner for quite some time, the opportunity finally presented itself on Saturday afternoon, so I took advantage.   I strolled in on an early Saturday afternoon, with small children and a teenager in tow. My boys immediately took a liking to all the bear decor, Black Bear Diner is truly living up to its name.   The hostess immediately greeted us and we were seated right away. The bus person came out, took our drink orders and let us know the server would be with us shortly. Meanwhile we were waiting, we had plenty of time to look over the menu, by the time our server appeared, we all knew what to order. Our server was friendly but a bit stand-offish, she wouldn't make eye contact.   Items Ordered:  -Tri-Tip Dip Sandwich -Chocolate Cream Pie  Our food came out about 10 minutes after placing our order, so it came out quick! I ordered my sandwich with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. The meat was tender but it had no flavor, it was very bland. It came with a side of au jus so that made it a little bit better. They don't skimp on fries here. Everyone's plate had an abundance of fries, the seasoning they use made them taste great. Now, onto dessert, the chocolate cream pie was amazing! It was really rich and creamy, it was the best part of the meal. It came topped with a lot of whipped cream and chocolate chips, the bottom layer of the crust is chocolate. Since we came in after 11 a.m., my boys received a free sundae with their meal.  Overall, I would return but next time I would try something else on the menu since I wasn't a fan of the tri-tip dip sandwich. Food is decent, service is good but our server could have been a little bit more attentive. As we were leaving, our boys were given a balloon each by the hostess, I thought that was a nice gesture for the small patrons.",

From the cute little (and some big) bears, to the waitresses in suspenders and classic diner hospitality, Black Bear Diner easily buttered me up before I even received my meal!  The vegetarian omelet I got was chock full of sauteed vegetables, much more than I had expected! The egg also had that standard fluffy quality. And the biscuits...They were massive! They were warm and fluffy and oh-so-delicious thanks to the fact that my date decided to get gravy on the side. On another note, the hash browns I had were my favorite to date and the corned beef hash was better than I've ever tasted.  We also got the banana cream pie, which was pretty good but not mind-blowing. It was sweet, creamy, and crispy in all the right places.  The best part? All that delicious food for a very reasonable price tag. When we left, the hosts even bid us loud and unabashed goodbyes! Charming.",

Salad was awesome and so was the tuna melt i had to reorder.  Manager was very nice as we spoke with him about the meal. Unfortunately the supervisor we spoke to was not very knowledgeable about the way to cook salmon, as my son in law got, if the salmon was not thick.  Seriously!  It was like a brick, crispy on outside and dry in the middle.    As for their service, our waitress was just ok.  Turned nice when I pointed out there was no mention of mushrooms in the pot pie on the menu.  She immediately responded, yes, just spoke to my manager about that.  Well, I was right!  Well must say I will not return if I return to Vegas!",

The manager was visible and totally involved, the employees were well trained and clearly knew their tasks, but still managed to be friendly. Had the chicken fried steak (pik attached), and it was good.   Management and training really did stand out, hard to imagine how anyone would be disappointed by a visit here.",

    "text": "We read the reviews and this place seemed to have all their ducks in a row as other yelpers have posted their service and food were great.   While others have said the opposite,  which peaked my curiosity to try this place myself.  So we decided to arrive early around 530 pm to avoid the rush.   When we got there the restaurant had plenty of seats and no wait which made us very happy. 5 stars  The cup of chicken noodle I ordered was awful and tasted like it came from a can.  1 star  The chicken and waffle was misleading since it was chicken tender and waffle,  but that didn't matter because the waffle was delicious. Although the tender was dry and hard versus juicy and crispy like it should be. 3 stars  Chicken Biscuit and gravy presentation was a fail,  but it tasted good so that was a win.   We decided a more suitable name would be upside down chicken pot pie. 3 stars  The kids portion were enormous, that's about it.  Nothing great. 3 stars  It's a restaurant chain with ok food but it wasn't anything amazing about it when you compare it to the other big names like Dennys or IHOP. I can see us visiting this place maybe once a year...maybe.  My wife looked down when we were seated and noticed the floors were filthy.  Good thing these are zero demerits and since their last inspection in April they still struggle in this area.",

When your sick of the strip rape and want to get a great meal and save some $$ for other things this is one of the places you want to go to.  We got the Grizz meal and it came with way too much food.  Only complaint is the bacon was too salty.  Minor thing: the biscuit is really dry... good for gravy but not for jam.  The pancakes are awesome, and filling.  Ham and Sausage were good, sausage was best I had in a week in Vegas.  Eggs were fine, we recommend you ask them to mix the cheese in if that's your thing.  Fresh OJ was very good.  Their coffee was good.   Place can be very busy so plan ahead and deal with a little line.  Also pays to know what you want when the server comes to your table and lay it on them.  They are going to be pretty busy so they will not stop by a lot.  No biggie... just know what your in for.",

Biscuits looked great but it was very gummy. Forget the biscuit choose something else like toast.  Me: Mini-volcano breakfast Bacon, sausage and egg were cooked to order. My apologies for being a pancake snob. Pancakes for me were no bueno. No crisp to the edges, chewy and rubbery.  Son: Breakfast bowl Eggs were over cooked. Biscuit was ... well ... Chewy and gummy. No bueno for the breakfast bowl. Service was great.  Very friendly and coffee was better than usual for a coffee shop. Very busy on this Saturday morning. Maybe wait for lunch or dinner.",

I personally haven't tried too much of their breakfast options but alot of their lunches and dinners are great. I had the turkey sandwich with fries.

I wasn't too impressed with the food. It was not worth the wait for something that I probably could've gotten at a Denny's diner. They did offer a military discount, our bill came out to $201! Again not impressed with the food, my $10 omelet was bland and small along with the old ass fruit.

Since I wanted to catch up with a friend that I rarely see, I was looking for a restaurant that wouldn't rush us in and out. A couple of my friends recommended this place saying that it was very \"family friendly\" with good food.  We came around 9am on Veteran's Day, it was packed but we were seated quickly.  The menus are printed on newspapers and have some articles on the adult menus and games/coloring activities on the kids menus.  The manager also came by to give the kids balloons!  Our server Cindie was great!  She was always smiling, very attentive, and accommodating!   I ordered the Vegetarian Omelette which consisted of 3 eggs, mushroom, onion, tomato, bell pepper, spinach, and jack cheese. I also added ham and jalapenos.  The meal included a choice of hash browns, country potatoes or fresh fruit and a housemade biscuit. I chose the country potatoes.  Everything was cooked and flavored perfectly!   The portion sizes are pretty big and the prices are very reasonable. I was very happy with my overall experience here!  I will definitely be back again!",

There were 7 of us waiting for table. On several occasions we told the  hostess and gentleman who was helping her to split our group into two tables if it helps get our table quicker. They assured 20-25 minutes. It took 45 minutes until they decide to split the table. Pretty bad judgment call. On a positive note, Barbara was one the the best, customer oriented person we have ever met. She new we waited quite some time and did all she could to help expedite our order at both tables. We also noticed her wonderful attention with another group next to us. She put so much attention to their needs. I hardly ever give reviews but Barbara deserves this review and wish her such a bright future. When I commended her for her wonderful attention and personality, she said \"thank you so much, I even have chills on my arms\" because she was so happy to hear it. The most beautiful thing came out of her afterwords, she said \"I really love my job\". Not too many people say this and show it. Barbara, you are wonderful and remember to always be ahead of the next person. She would be a good example and trainer for your company. You show it with your personality and strive. God bless!",

    "text": "If I could give this place a negative star I would. First, the customer service was horrible. Candy was our server and she seemed like she didn't like us there. Very short with us and a bit rude. We ordered our food and waited. I was hoping the food would make up for the lack of service. As we are waiting for the food, candy (server) was walking around helping all the other customers with a smile and very nice. I'm thinking, that is weird. Maybe when she gives our food to us, she will be nice now. The food comes and Candy says excuse me! and throws my plate down and does the same with my BF. Wow! WTF did we do? Whatever, by this time, I'm like let's just eat our food and leave ASAP. She made me feel so uncomfortable. She went to other tables and she was chatting and laughing and recommending items to customers. I have never felt so uncomfortable and confused in my life.  Onto the food review:  I take a bite of my Tri tip sandwich (blazin bear sandwich) and it is cold. The bread and the tri tip was very cold. It came straight out of the refrigerator and onto my plate. The most disgusting thing I have eaten. I couldn't even finish my food. The Tri tip was hard and dry cause it was so cold. Not sure how they can serve food colder than room temperature, when what you ordered was suppose to be a hot sandwich?? I ended up eating my fries, since that was the only edible thing. My BF ordered the grizz. The bacon was cold and soggy like it was cooked hours ago. My BF complained that the pancakes tasted funny, so me loving pancakes, I told him if I can have some of his pancakes since my food wasn't edible. I took a bite of the pancake and realized it was raw. The pancake was gooey in the middle and uncooked batter. That was my last straw. I wanted to leave whenever candy came back. She gave us the bill and I payed up front and left as fast as I can.",

Food was fantastic, service (our server was Anthony) he was phenomenal and the evening shift supervisor (Marlene) was absolutely Divine such a beautiful spirit and great personality.   Pancakes with just the right amount of chrispy-ness around the edges, Patty melt Burger on grilled sourdough was succulent and the blue cheese dressing I had for my salad an the side of Ranch and Thousand island dressing's not sure if they were housemaid or not but some of the best I've had.   This spot is a must visit sorry it took so long for me to discover it however I will definitely be back quite frequently to catch up on the years I've been missing out.   Should you ever visit (the Las Vegas Tropicana location) I would recommend requesting Anthony as your server. An as a side note he has such amazingly piercing eyes and he smelt fantastic.",

They chose the Black Bear as an alternative to a hotel/casino diner and I was glad for that.  It was Saturday morning and the place looked busy!  My timing was just right though, I got there first and was seated in a booth immediately.  I was greeted promptly by our server William who was bursting with energy it seemed!  He brought my coffee while I waited for my friends.  When the rest of my party arrived we were taken care of quickly and courteously by William, they also remarked on how friendly and chipper he was, which is what you hope to see at an American diner.  Food was great! And very reasonable, service was relatively quick considering how slammed the place was, and again our server William was excellent, he should get a raise!  Or a free day off or something!  Highly recommend and will repeat next time I'm in Vegas!",

Everywhere you look, there is something that has to do with black bears. You don't see that at every place you go to eat at.  Since im trying to stay away from red meat, I ordered the Spicy Turkey on Sourdough Bread. It came with onion rings. If you refer to my pic, the sandwich itself is pretty big. I gotta say it was very tasty with a little kick to it. It Definitely filled me up.  Service was above average meaning she came around and checked up on me every now and then. I only had to ask for refills once so she was on point for the most part.  I would say this place is a decent place to go to if plan A falls through. For some reason I thought they were 24 hours but they have had the same hours since they opened long ago.  So this place to me is ok in my book. Decent food, service, and ambiance. Nothing really stands out and nothing really deserves a complaint.",

The menu is inside the newspaper they hand you... took me a second to figure that out :)   Pancakes and Eggs Benedict were delicious! The desert looked very appetizing, however the breakfast was so large, I had no room left. Nonetheless I look forward to trying it when I return again.   They have several credo's they try to follow. If you need changes they're willing to accommodate if possible. I did need changes to the potatoes, they didn't get it exactly right, however I'm sure if I am more clear of my needs in the future, they'll do everything they can to make it right.   Also a small add, however very welcomed, is that they have flavored creamer for the coffee. Always a pleasant surprise!   **small note: Kids eat free if they bring in their teddy bear on Tuesday's :)",

The husband was adamant about stopping here so we did! Now he regrets it! \" told you so\"  Anyway... The young man that sat us down was friendly and brought our teas.. Our server (sorry missed her name) was just as friendly and took our orders.. I ordered the French dip (plain) and ff.. My other 1/2 orders the turkey burger tex mex  style.. My French dip was really dry, it's a good thing I had the a jus for dipping other wise I would've choked on it, maybe the loaded one wouldn't have been so dry.. The FF would have been awesome had they not over salted them with season salt .. I finished the FD since i had something to wet it down with!! The husband ... Who normally cleans his plate, wasn't able to finish his turkey burger, the patty was super dry and very bland, the bun fell apart on the first bite, so he tried taking it apart to finish it but just couldn't get past the dull taste of turkey, his fries were just as bad as mine... Our server asked if there was something wrong with his meal since he barely ate 1/2 of it.. He mentioned it was too bland and dry, she actually agreed with him and offered something else, he declined but she insisted he take a free dessert  of his choice home to make up for his yucky dinner.. We thought that was really nice of her but it's just not enough to get us to return.. Nope ! Just not going there... Sorry Black Baar but this was a one way trip ..",

I had an order of chicken fried steak that was so tender and tasty that I could literally cut it with the fork.  Along with that, I had diced red potatoes with onions/peppers and a killer sweet-cream pancake.  My wife had the hobo omelet, hash browns and a huge homemade biscuit.  The daughter had a stack of the pancakes, eggs and bacon.  We were so stuffed that there was no way we could enjoy any dessert, so the wife got a bear claw to go.  Apparently that was pretty good too, since I never got a single bite of it...  The entire staff there is super nice and friendly (normal) people.  We'll definitely be back  (Might be in the running for best chicken fried steak ever...)",

The burgers are great, the blackberry cobbler is absolutely to die for, and kids go nuts for their happy fries.  (Those are fries in the shape of a happy face - who wouldn't go nuts for them?)  For a neighborhood restaurant, it doesn't get much better than this.  The waitresses can be a little inattentive and the service a bit slow at time which is the only thing that detracts from this awesome little hole in the wall.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. I've been coming here once a week on average for pretty much 3 years now. The staff are super sweet and are always happy and willing to serve. Also, they literally have the best BLT in town for the price, if you get the \"BLAST\" it is a sin to not also have a side of their ranch with bacon. Yes, sometimes whoever the chef is that day puts out food that's a little sloppy. Once I was a little freaked out because they gave me my breakfast with a side of dried out/rotten orange slices (but it was the \"garnish\" stuff on the side I never eat anyway). But the thing is, if you just point out what's wrong with your food, they are happy to fix it immediately. So if you want a bowl of chicken noodle soup, some chicken strips, or a BLT, this is your place. By no means should you come here with any higher expectations. There are stuffed bears lining the entire diner, honestly what sort of food are you expecting lol",

    "text": "Wow, this was a fail on all levels.  I can't really understand all the glowing reviews.  The corned beef hash was so over-grilled that it was hard and chewy like jerky.  Underneath were a few good bites of hash but 80% of it was ruined.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered hash at 4 in the afternoon? They do advertise breakfast all day but maybe the morning breakfast cooks handle it better.  HUGE disappointment.  The country potatoes were chunks of REALLY greasy potatoes sprinkled with some burnt onions.  Not caramelized or sauteed onions but actually black, incinerated, charred and inedible.  My over-medium eggs were over easy, very easy.  And the big biscuit was MICROWAVED and chewy, soggy.  Anybody who knows anything about biscuits knows not to microwave them.    I've never been to a chain restaurant that served a great breakfast so I was a little leary about the yelp reviews.  But this turned out even worse than I could have expected.  For a good breakfast in Vegas I will stick to Maple Tree Cafe on Spring Valley and The Omelet House on Charleston.",

A busser greeted us at the door and walked us to a booth. Only problem was that I asked for a table but I guess he didn't hear me. A few moments later our server got our orders and the food came out quick. I decided to order the stuffed cheddar burger. I ordered it well done, I got my burger rare. I ordered well because I know stuffed burgers take a lot longer to cook. I called the server over and told her my burger was still under, she tried to explain to me that's how there burgers come. I cook for a living, we server burgers as well at my work, don't give me that BS. Anyways she really didn't try to fix the situation. My girlfriend didn't want us to make a scene so I left the issue alone. Later while some of us were still eating the server comes up to our table and try to start taking our plates. Sorry we are slow eaters, sorry we were conversing instead of eating. On the bright side there pancakes were really really good. Enough for me to give this place a second try sometime down the road.",

The blackberry pie was AMAZING also has the chocolate cream which was ok not good not bad. One of the waitresses is funny & always talks & jokes with you but I forgot her name (shame on me).

This was my 2nd time dining there, and as much as I wanted to try something different, I couldn't help but order chicken fried steak.  They do a great job - it's a large portion, served with hashbrowns and eggs.  The patty is perfectly crispy and the gravy is delicious.  It's a busy place during peak breakfast hours (they are open through dinner as well).  I've noticed both times that the servers sometimes get a little overwhelmed.

The only reason for 4 /5 stars is no turkey substitutes for bacon or sausage. If you don't eat pork you will just have to do without. Also, they didn't really communicate that we pay at the front counter for our meal. The waiter brought our bill but never returned to take our payment. So we eventually figured this out.",

    "text": "Quick Look: Not exactly a classic \"diner\" that someone from the Northeast (like myself) would be accustomed to. Someone said a \"country kitchen\" in another review and that is spot-on. Let's just say it's a country-diner w/ decent enough food.   In Depth Review: Walked in on a Saturday at 8pm and was greeted by a friendly hostess and a pie display case that sounded like the motor was on it's last leg and needed some WD-40. I asked to be sat away from that noise. They sat us in a back corner table near the kitchen, the floor underneath was covered in food debris from previous diners. Not the best first impression. I am not going to lie, I was nervous at this point.   Waitress seemed friendly and took our drink orders. We each ordered the Arnold Palmer (iced tea / lemon-aid / strawberries) and they were delicious. The lady ordered the corned beef and hash breakfast and I ordered the grilled chicken and avocado club sandwich with a side of fries. Took about 15 minutes for our food to make it to the table. Side note: during this time I used the bathroom. The man's bathroom was quite the site. The toilets were disgusting. The vent system was making an awful screeching noise in the ceiling above and the light was flickering. Was the perfect creepy setting for an 80's horror flick. I was really nervous at this point and got out of there fast!   The food arrived and the portions were HUGE! They certainly feed you here. My wife loved the corned beef and hash and scarfed down a good amount. She's tiny and I was impressed. My chicken club sandwich looked great but was not up to par in the taste department. The chicken was overcooked and dry. The bacon was hard as a rock. I am certain the bacon was not cooked fresh and was cooked earlier in the day and just slapped on the sandwich to expedite the kitchen process. On a positive note, the french fries were AMAZING!   So it was a mixed bag with our first experience here. The bill was cheap and I can understand why so many senior citizens were eating here. Saves them and anyone on a fixed income money. The food was decent enough, just not over the top impressive.   In Summary: I have been missing the Greek Diners that I grew up going to in New York. The massive Lemon Meringue pies that are about a foot tall in the display cases up front. The club sandwiches, steak fries, milkshakes, fresh coffee and all day long breakfast at the counter w/ your neighbors. Was hoping that the Black Bear Diner would satisfy my diner itch, but sadly it did not.",

A suggestion to the management would be to get a bench for the outside area. Ambience: very informal, very casual. Decorated in early \"bear\" - photographs of bears, stuffed bears, and sayings about bears decorate the walls all around the restaurant. Just about the right tone for a place to go for a family brunch. Food: my wife and I shared a California omelet and the bear claw french toast. The California omelet add sauteed mushrooms, melted cheese, avocado, and other goodies folded into what appeared to be a 3 egg omelet. Fabulous!!! This had to be the best California omelette I've had in any breakfast place in a very long time. The bear claw french toast came with butter and syrup. It was stuffed with almond flavoring. Incredibly sweet. You certainly don't need the syrup on this one. A delicious second course to follow up the omelette. Service: our server was very friendly and very welcoming. Unfortunately we got there during the Sunday morning rush and she was spread way too thin. Service was a little slower than I would have liked. However I was not in a rush and this did not significantly detract from the meal. I will definitely come back here again for a family brunch. An excellent meal at a very reasonable price.

The place is a typical American diner, except for the fact that it's full of bears!! Stuffed animals, paintings, staff's shirts, even the sauce bottles and the napkins have bears signs on them, not to speak of my waffle... So the ambience becomes really funny and enjoyable! Quality/prices ratio is also great. We had more than decent (still not extraordinary) food at a good value and we exited the place full and satisfied.",

We've been coming to Black Bear 1-2x per week for the past 2+ years and it's never anything but super-clean, super-attentive and we've never once had a bad meal. The one or two times where the kitchen \"got it wrong\" had been instantly remedied by our waiter/waitress, with a great attitude and mile-wide smiles. (Contrary to how some customers feel, you should speak up and see how the staff accomodates your compaint, BEFORE leaving a negative review).",

You were arrogant and rude you yelled at your poor waitress who was trying so desperately to accommodate to her full area. Everyone was upset! You them tell me nd other customers that our meal would be comped which it wasnt. Now the thing that truly upset me was our poor waitress was so upset she was crying. She was  apologizing for the service since the other waitresses were grabbing her food and she couldn't provide the service she wanted....never ever put down your staff in front of clients!!!  Horrible service not because of the waitress but because of management!!!!   Fire DON hire someone that knows what he is doing, maybe then he can stop comping out meals!!!!!! And make it enjoyable!!!",

    "text": "I went on Yelp one morning to find out where my boyfriend Don and I should have breakfast at. We wanted to go somewhere we've never been before and a place that was a local hot spot. I came across this place and (based on the reviews) it was a must.  We met up in the plaza around 9am. The place is pretty incognito on the outside. Because we live in Vegas, it just looked like another sports bar and grill to us. Don actually used to live down the street from the diner and I guess he never thought it was an awesome restaurant, judging on its low-key appearance.   We were greeted and seated right away. Based on the personal conversations and waitresses knowing the customers' names, it seemed like there were a lot of regulars. That's how you know this pace is a local gem!  I ordered some coffee and Don ordered some oj. After perusing through the Black Bear Times Newspaper Menu, Don decided on the Country Fried Steak and Eggs and I opted for the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes with a side of sausage links. Normally I'd get pancakes with chocolate chips or sweet toppings, but I decided on the 7-grain because the menu said that they were FAMOUS for them.   Our plates came and they were pretty big. Good thing neither of us got the hungry bear breakfasts! Don's plate came with a giant biscuit that was perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. It was soo delightful!  I didn't try any of his country fried steak or potatoes, but he finished the entire plate, which is a good sign!  My pancakes were delicious! I've never had anything like them. Normally when I order pancakes, I can't finish them, but this time I finished all three and the sausage links. They were perfect with the syrup and they weren't too dry or too mushy at all. The almonds gave them a very nice sweet taste and the grain/granola combo actually tasted awesome (sorry, I can't really explain!). It didn't taste as \"healthy\" as it sounds though, which was definitely a plus in my book! It probably was pretty healthy though, because I literally had to drive like a madman all the way home and run into my house just to use the bathroom.   All in all, I love this place! It's a great place for breakfast and it is definitely a local gem. I really suggest you try the 7-Grain Almond Granola Pancakes if you're a fan of pancakes, because you will love them. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is hard to come across these days. Their coffee is also delicious and it comes with free refills of course!",

Our table ordered a lot of dishes based on the recommendations made by fellow Yelpers, and you guys did not lead us astray.

It was cute- I felt like I was home.  My friends and I ordered breakfast, but they do have lunch and dinner.   We had eggs, bacon, pancakes, potatoes, and coffee. The food came out faster than expected, and was hot. More importantly, it looked like everything was fresh and homemade ( the eggs looked like real eggs, and the hash browns looked like they cut their own potatoes). It was good, but it tastes like something I could make at home. The \"sweet cream\" pancakes were too cakey for our liking, but the flavor was there.  The hash browns had good flavor, but they needed a tad bit more cooking. The bacon tasted great.   They do have a wide selection of pies ( i LOVE pies). I didn't try any, but it all looked so delicious.   I would come back to try more things on the menu in order to have a better idea on how I really feel about this place.",

I have since fallen in love with the rustic ambiance and delicious food that Black Bear serves up. And their wait staff is amazing as well. It's such a great place to take the family!! Try the corn beef hash!! It's delicious!!",

    "text": "I will preface this by saying I am very critical of breakfast restaurants. Staff is very friendly and on point at all times. The look of the place is fun too stuffed bears fill a small shelf that trims the interior. Carved bears and cute chachki gifts for purchase. I am a firm believer that if you have a signature dish it should knock me over, or at least be something I will talk about. Black Bears trophy meal is Chicken Fried Steak (also one of my guilty pleasures). Firstly get the freakin orange slice, parsley and plastic portion cups off my plate (All these things just say Denny's,IHOP). Eggs were cooked right, Hash Browns were good, Chicken fried steak was just OK. It is panko crusted gravy was not very flavorfull and I got a lump of flour or whatever they thickened it with. For me to not finish a Chicken Fried steak is a big deal. The other diner had a Choriso,Green Chili, and Cheese Omlette. My first bite was a sinuey grissel and cheese that was spicey. Not the best Choriso I have had. The Coffee here is so weak that I didn't even finish one cup. I ordered milk when it came the plastic cup smelled like dish cleaner and was still wet? This place is driven by an older crowd and that explains the weak coffee and bland food. Not the mediocre choriso though. This is also a chain so the recipes are not changing, and from the 20 min. wait to get in why would they. This is more from the lack of enough Rock Star breakfast spots, than a salute to the quality of Black Bear itself. As of yet Hash House A Go Go and some select casino spots are still holding the top spot by a large margin.  I am gonna give them 3 stars this is driven by the ambiance and service.",

    "text": "This is the first time I'm writing about Black Bear. Their food can't be beat for the price and it's homemade! HOWEVER..I am writing this review in the booth of a local Denny's because yet again the service at black bear was bad. We stood and waited for a seat for about 7 minutes... With no one in front of us.. Only to be seated at a booth with the menus thrown on the table. We sit down and our waitress walks past several times... Finally she says \"I'll be with you soon\" and then proceeds to walk past us another 3 times... She didn't even take our drink order... We walk out, walking past her... And she couldn't even say anything as we walk past... It's sad because we really like the food but sadly we won't be back there. This happened twice--first time--shame on you... Second time.. Shame on me. There won't be a third.",

But that was just me feeling unbalanced after walking 7 miles in the CES conference...lol... I had a great experience here, the waiter was very friendly and the place was neat. I did not have to go to the restroom so I cannot judge the cleanliness there.  The place was also clean at the table and plates / look. I tried to order the  smalls portion on the menu and it was still large. At this place you get more bang for your buck. I would recommend this place... My hubby said the homemade biscuits were sooooooo good and huge. I would definitely come here again when I visit Vegas. My taste buds was off on the steak I ordered, don't get fried steak unless you want fried foods. I had a taste for the sauteed steak. But overall it was so cool. The waiter noticed my feelings towards my meal and acknowledge them.  But I felt like Inside this place it felt like a you were not even in Vegas but in a very homely secure place.",

    "text": "I usually enjoy this restaurant, but as of lately, the service seems to have really gone downhill.  On my wife and I's last outing, we placed our orders and the waitress kept forgetting our drinks. They didn't show until after the appetizer and salads had been delivered.  Needless to say, refills seemed to be out of the question.  The waitress also brought the wrong meal out for my wife.  While they did eventually bring the right one, she was left waiting while everyone else was eating.  After this happened, we didn't see our waitress at our table the rest of the night.  Every time she came near, she would avoid all eye contact with us.  I tend to tip at least 20% whereever I dine out, but this is one of the few instances where I definitely left nothing for our server.  The food is great, but good, even decent service has be to there, otherwise its not worth going out.",

    "text": "Yum! The restaurant had awesome food! Traveling to Vegas can strain you and of course you have to find that perfect diner the morning after a night of crazy drunkeness. I used my trusty yelp app, and the Black Bear Diner popped up. I called ahead of time, I heard the place gets packed, and they said it would be a 15 min wait. They couldn't take my reservation over the phone though, :( but when we got there we did wait the full 15 mins, but it wasn't that bad. Our waitress was sooo busy in her section but she still managed to check on us when we needed, it's like she read our minds. I had the breakfast from their smaller portions section of the menu. I think it was called the volcano? I can't remember. Anyhoo, I couldn't finish! The small portions are big too! The fruit bowl I ordered on the side was sooo good too. I would definitely come back again! Thanks Black Bear Diner, see you next time I'm in Vegas!",
