The food was decent, but I didn't think it was spectacular, I've definitely had better Italian food at a much more reasonable price.  If you go, I suggest you keep the food order simple and enjoy the wait staff, they are truly great.",

It seems like most people reviewing places in Vegas are pretty high-rollers, who don't balk at a $100/person price tag on a meal, but frankly if I'm paying that much I expect something good.  The food was bland and boring, as were the drinks.  I didn't even notice the service, so that suggests to me it was equally bland.  Take your business elsewhere-- it seems like these Vegas restaurants need to learn that people won't just keep coming back and paying prices like that for sub-par food.",

We requested to be sit somewhere inside that can still overlook \"St. Mark's Square\". When we arrived, there was a little line to the host but everyone was turned down and left. I was glad we made reservation because we were immediately brought to our table. The restaurant was crowded on a week night.   We ordered the Fettuccine with pork and mushroom, and the Frittura de pesce misto. The Waiter seemed like he was not happy when we did not order any wine. The dishes arrived on beautiful plates. The fettuccine was not on the online menu but it was the best I had. It did taste homemade because it was chewy. The sauce was very good which was not too heavy or light, just the right texture. Pork and mushroom were cooked in perfection. This was a great dish.   We should not have ordered the Fritture de pesce misto. The deep fry seafood was in large portion and too much to be shared between two people. There was only one or two scallop and too many calamari. I liked the fry smelts and this dish would probably be ideal if there were more people to share.   I would definitely come back for more paste when I visit Vegas another time.",

I ordered the sea bass filet, which our server had recommended. I was disappointed.  The sauce that they use was way too salty, and they must have unloaded of quart of that stuff all over my food. The menu mentioned potatoes. I got about six mini pieces. Seriously, they could have at least added enough to fill up the plate. The sea bass itself was disappointing too. I was expecting oily, melt in your mouth sea bass. Instead, it was dry and a little tough.   Plus for the service. Neg on the actual food.",

    "text": "Mixed review. The food was enjoyed by most of our wedding party but the service was not good from the moment we were seated. Well not all of us since only 13 chairs were placed for a party of 15. Ok we can over look that, honest mistake right. Well it was mistake after mistake. I don't know if our waiter was new but he was clearly overwhelmed. We only had 15 people and 1 infant.   We pre booked our reception in a private room with a custom menu. We went over the menu around 3 times, please explain why it was wrong. Ok we can overlook that, not really but whatever what can you do. He takes our orders and I swear it took forever for our first course. Then forever plus forever for the main course. He didn't come by to refill glasses or take additional drink orders but hey we can overlook that. Then we had our wedding cake for dessert but no waiter anywhere to be found to clear the table, cut cake, bring dessert plates, etc. So everyone is sitting around and my lil one is becoming antsy. My new hubby goes to find a waiter for help, any waiter will do at this point. So the new waiter brings plates and does not remove 1 freakin dish from the table. Now I'm getting upset and my hubby knows it. Then the waiter comes back and serves dessert lemon vodka thing, I can't remember the name, while the other waiter is cutting the cake. Of course the children get ice cream because they can't have vodka. Well a guest to our wedding doesn't drink and requested the ice cream. The waiter then tells her no because it's only for children. No more overlooking!! Another guest actually gets up and gets the manager at this point. From the moment the manager arrived things went much more smoothly. He was very helpful. Oh and that other guest got a specially made ice cream bowl from the manager that she enjoyed.   This place may be good if you are just coming in for dinner but for a reception, not so much. Oh and don't order the veal it was tough.",

We were seated promptly and because my husband and I love to sit next to each other and are very private, they granted our request and sat us in a booth. The servers were attentive, timely and knowledgeable. Our bread and butter came as soon as we sat down- the various breads were soft, warm and had enough crisp on the first bite with the dough melting right in your mouth.. The butter was at room temperature which spread easily on the breads.. They had an olive oil concoction w/ different spices that made it great for dipping..  As Ive mentioned before, my husband and I are great fans of calamari so we ordered their Calamaretti Fritti for an appetizer-  perfectly breaded and deep-fried w/out having the oily aftertaste nor left the plate it came on oily.   I was craving pizza and wanted something small so I ordered their \"personal\" pizza- Quattro Stagioni which were cut into four slices with each slice containing ham, mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes.. \"Personal\" my butt, it was HUGE and it was DELICIOUS, especially since I am not a thin crust pizza kinda gal!! As the calamari wasnt oily, this too wasnt oily- pure deliciousness.  My husband ordered Branzino as Sale o Alla Griglia (seabass) and that came w/ veges and mashed potatoes. The bass was meaty and his veges & potatoes were fresh. K is critical when it comes to his steak and bass and he was extremely happy with his meal.  We saw other dishes being served to other patrons and they all looked appetizing. We were not disappointed at all and were glad that we had our first dinner in Vegas at this restaurant. I highly recommend, if youre ever at the Venetian, to come check this place out.   But then again, its just my opinion..",

Alas, they've not had that entree since and I always thought it was the best pasta I'd ever had. I still do. We ate at Canaletto with some friends a couple of nights ago and it was, well, alright. There were four of us and with gratuity it was about $35 apiece, a bit high for pasta dishes and salads with one dessert; all of which were, well, good, but just a level or so above mediocre. Sitting outside and \"[staring] at the fun faux-clouds\" as Marcia M. noted is fine; actually nice, once or maybe twice. The noise, however, is borderline intolerable and most of all, the Venetian's mimes seem to be gone.   And what the devil is it with diners and computers. Yeah, Canaletto has wi-fi, or the Venetian does but I find it annoying to go to a restaurant like this and see folks typing away on computers. Who the h*** is that important that he or she needs to be connected 24/7. So, perhaps, all who do this will take this strong hint: Leave your d*** computers at home when you dine out; stop texting in movie theatres...or just eat a Burger King.  Perhaps living in Las Vegas with all its great restaurants has jaded me a bit, but I'd rather go to Buca...",

She offered prosciutto instead and that was a failed suggestion, because it added nothing.  My dinner partner had their pasta special. Penne pasta with chicken, vegetables, tossed in a red sauce. Nothing spectacular to note.  Service was slow.  The thing about service in a restaurant is timing. The server works itself in your time, and it's not the other way around. I could have been on a gondola and down the canal in between the time I waited for the dessert menu (which we decided to skip because it took too long) and asking for the check.

Service was slow and spotty. When we were seated, the waitress told us she was sending out water. Said water didn't arrive until we had received our meals and drinks, and only after we asked our waitress about it again. When we were offered parmesan on our food, the man who asked just walked away and vanished. We had to flag down or waitress to get it, who was noticeably absent throughout the evening. She then proceeded to absent-mindedly drop a huge chunk of cheese on the table, only to leave it there throughout the meal.  Food was alright and came out very quickly, though it was almost too quickly, as if it had already been prepared before we ordered it.   After the whole experience, I would probably not come back. There are many other restaurants nearby to choose from (it is Vegas, after all).",

We opted for this little place due to my Italian food obsession.

My two friends went to go smoke, my other two went to the bar where some lady said: lets all have some shots. They thought the person who said lets have some shots was paying, but the bartender brought them a tab for their Patron shots- about $25 bucks each. Watch out for that gimmick, maybe the bar fly was placed there by the restaurant to increase bar sales. They only serve olive oil with their bread, no vinegar, so we helped ourselves to the bottle of vinegar hanging on the side of a waiter station. The menu seemed to have been written in Italian and thankfully the menu items had descriptors in English. My friend ordered the squid ink risotto that had shrimp and cuttle fish. The entire dish looked like shit on a plate the way it was presented. I had a taste b/c he raved about it but it tasted like day old fish. Like the way rotten fish smells that's how it tasted. I almost threw up and instantly became nauseous.  My friend had a ham and mozzarella calzone that was pretty tasty. I had angel hair w. bolognese. It was good, but they were skimpy on the sauce. I didn't try the other dishes. The entire meal came to 175. 6 entrees plus a bottle of wine.  Not sure why this place was so lackluster, but I'm sure to never go back.",

I've never actually sat inside for dinner as the primary joy of this restaurant is the faugh outdoor seating.   Dress can be from nearly black tie to causal, just don't show up in swim shorts and flip flops!  There is usually live music, flute and violin, on weekend nights which is very nice. People meandering through St. Mark's Square really bring s the full Italian street restaurant ambiance. Without the pigeons!  A couple of drinks for two, two entrees', desert and digestifs, with tip about $150. Not your everyday affair but not bad for a nice night out.  Food is generally above average, but some expect more because he restaurant presents a much more refined atmosphere. If you get something you don't like or didn't order, be polite and send it back or ask for the manager. This is Vegas. If done right, you'll get treated right.  Servers always seem to be FOB from Europe if not Italy directly. Very polite, but in fashion that seems brusk to many who haven't been to Europe. Also, they leave you alone to let you enjoy your meal and your time there. You may have to ask for something as servers aren;t at your table every five minutes trying to usher you out.",

    "text": "I'm afraid I have to lower Canaletto a peg.  It may have just been mainly what I ate this time.  Homemade light Minestrone Di Verdura Soup was good; Insalata Cesarina with a light Caesar Dressing was excellent; and crusty Italian bread and rolls were really good with butter.  Roasted Potatoes were very good, as well.  But what was supposed to be the piece de resistance--a whole salt-encrusted Branzino--was just a very moist but rather bland fish.  And, once it was deboned, it reduced down to a smaller edible portion than I expected.  Plus, I still wound up with 4 bones in my mouth on different bites.  Service was otherwise excellent; the ambiance on the patio of The Venetian's St. Mark's Square with electronic violins playing nearby was very nice; and Crespelle Di Mele was once again an excellent dessert, with Colombina al Cioccolato very good as well, as a second sweet ending for my party of four.  But next time I will return to mussels and pasta!",

Our waiter was an older man with an accent that made it really feel like an Italian place!  We started with the bread with oil & vinegar- the rolls with the olives in them were perfectly balanced.  Then we shared the caprice salad - the fresh mozzarella couldn't have been better and paired well with the fresh basil and tomatoes.  Then I had a risotto that had beef tenderloin, mushrooms and parmesan cheese in it - it was mouth watering good.  The other person with me had their signature calzone - I had more than a bite of it because it was that good and was oozing cheese!  The prices here were more than reasonable especially for the exceptional service.  If you needed a plate taken away or a glass refilled they were there before you could ask!  Sitting in the promenade area getting to see one of the Carnevale shows at the same time made this experience perfect.",

    "text": "I should start this review by saying that the pasta here is incredible. My boyfriend and I ate here on our last night in Las Vegas because we were craving some good house made pasta and we were not disappointed. However, we received terrible service at this restaurant and, considering it was not an inexpensive meal, this should not have happened and was extremely upsetting.   My boyfriend and I look young (we are relatively young) but we have no problem spending money on a good meal. First, when we sat down, the waiter immediately came over and took away our wine glasses and the wine menu before asking if we wanted anything to drink. Uh... We did but you took our menus and glasses. He commented that we looked very young and he needed to see ID. We gladly showed it to him and he served us our wine. IDing me is not a problem but I was annoyed that he took our drink menus and glasses without asking.   After we ordered drinks, he must have come back about every 30 seconds to ask if we were ready to order yet. We felt rushed as we decided on appetizers and entrees. Thank god the food was amazing because I would have been pissed otherwise. We ordered Bruschetta, Gnocchi Formaggi, and Gnocchi al Ragu. The Gnocchi Formaggi was incredible.   As we ate our meal we noticed our waiter go to two different tables next to us to welcome them and read out the specials. I was a little annoyed before but I didn't think about it too much until the point. He certainly had not spent any time welcoming us into the restaurant and he definitely hadn't read us a single special. We were pretty insulted that he didn't seem to think we were worthy of basic restaurant etiquette.   Our waiter disappeared for the rest of the night until our plates had been taken away. We declined an offer for dessert but ordered two more glasses of wine. When he brought our drinks back he commented that we \"really should order a dessert with that.\" Pretty sure I already said no thank you?   As my boyfriend and I finished our wine and debated on getting a coffee, the waiter dropped the check on our table which made up our minds for us.   Honestly, we enjoyed ourselves at this restaurant. The food was incredible and the restaurant itself is very pretty. It was a great way to end our trip and I would definitely recommend it. But it's simply not fair to neglect a paying customer because of their age.",

It was a safe meal for tourists who enjoy simple foods without \"spice.\" There was a light sauce drizzled on the salmon that is have liked more of actually.

    "text": "Like a number of other experiences in Las Vegas, Canaletto is a restaurant which should offer a top quality meal and experience in a creative upscale environment.  While we found the food quality to be good, the execution wasn't up to par for the price point of the restaurant.  We were a tad early for our 6pm reservation - oops, didn't seem to read the note that we wanted to sit \"outside\".   Oops, didn't remember to bring you a glass of water without asking (it's Vegas in July for heaven's sake!)  The bread basket was generous, fresh and served with olive oil - oops, didn't offer balsamic vinegar (like other tables received).  We asked for the latter and it was mixed with the oil rather than offered in a jar or a separate dish.  We painstakingly reviewed the wine options and asked for 2 glasses off the specials menu - oops, didn't tell you that none of those are available, you need to choose from the wine list.  We ordered the grilled polenta as an appetizer - oops, didn't think to offer it with a bit of red sauce to accompany it.  Our main courses of grilled free-range chicken and sea bass (bronzino) were both very good and served hot with a side of spinach.  I think that this would be a great place for a group as there is room for a larger table, sitting \"outdoors\" allows for one to boisterous and the little details wouldn't matter as much.  However, for a couples night out, we found ourselves let down by the service and attention to detail.  If one does choose to sit outside in St Marks Square, just keep in mind that when the performers start, it can be quite noisy.  Canaletto is not inexpensive and I think that we just were expecting a better overall experience.  That said, it's still a nice setting and reasonable experience.  4 for the food, but 2 for the service - so, overall, a 3.",

We asked to be seated in the outside which was great for people watching and the Venation has a wonderful atmosphere.  Our waiter was very professional and handle our table to perfection. He brought us some olive oil and some great and I thought we could have just ate that and been perfectly content.   I tried the Goulash over Pasta and it was out of this world. The pasta is obviously made on site because it was to die for and very fresh. We had about 6 different dinners from Italian to Steak and no one had anything but to say but it was the best. My wife and daughter both got a different kind on gnocchi  and  they loved it also.  When it was time for desert my granddaughter went and told our  waiter that it was my daughters 21st BDay and they quickly brought out a Tiramisu desert with a candle and we were able to sing to her which she loves. A few people got the desserts and all had rave reviews.   Great place all the way around. It is not cheap but worth the indulgence.",

We were seated on the \"patio\" and there was a musical performance going on in front of the stores. It was awesome. We did have one little issue with one dish that had mussels and clams.

Bingo! It was absolutely delicious. The octopus was tender and flavorful and the potato salad + the acidity complemented the octopus well. $15 is definitely pricey for an appetizer but the portion is decent as well.

Situated in the Venetian, which by the way is my favorite hotel, Canaletto and its italian cuisine perfectly match the rest of the environment.  Luckily, we reserved: when we got there there was a 45 minute wait. However, the gentleman at the entrance was not too gentle just because we asked for a table 'outside' and he didn't have one.  Once seated, our waitress was very kind and she accomodated our request to eat in a reasonable amount of time since we had to attend a show later on.  Appetizers - Fried Mixed Vegetables: the frying was light and the vegetables were very tasty. As Italian, I never tasted fried tomatoes but that didn't disturb the overall flavor of the plate - Herb and Taleggio Flan (special of the day): if you love cheese and it's on the specials menu, you must have this! Hot cheese mixed with vegetables....yum!  Entrees: - Branzino al Prosecco e Zafferano: the branzino was delicate and cooked to perfection. The menu promised mashed potatoes but got spinach instead :( - Risotto Sant'Erasmo: we couldn't really taste the crab, but other than that the risotto was perfect.  Overall we were very pleased with the dinner and the price.  If you are in the mood for Italian and you find yourself near the Venetian, I think Canaletto is your best choice.",

My main course was grilled fish with vegetables.  The fish was OK but nothing special  The vegetables were overcocked.  My brother got micro heated spagetti dish, at least it felt that way he told me, it was like a skin Surface on top of the food.  In every way average but what could you expect for a restaurant in that size?",

    "text": "Dined at Canaletto with a group and we had a fantastic table on the patio out by the square. So fun! Started with some drinks and an amazing seafood platter! Crab legs, lobster, shrimp, mussels, and crab claws. Wow. Went for the insalata di pere. I loved it. Great combo of flavors. For dinner I had the pear ravioli with walnuts, sauce was rich but not too thick. The asparagus added a nice crunch and flavor. Husband went for the bone in ribeye. He liked it. The only thing that didn't wow were the side of white beans with the steak. Not bad, just not as much flavor as i expected with how great everything else was. I tried a friends risotto. Wow, it was the one with beef and mushrooms, amazing depth of flavor. Service was good. The whole table loved the meal. I would totally go back. And, the mgr was nice enough to show us a quick way to get another hotel for our show.",

    "text": "We started off our evening at Canaletto with some time at the bar before our reservation. We had a party of five and were waiting for the other two to arrive. I ordered some Makers Mark neat and a very healthy pour arrived (yay booze!). Other members of my party ordered a bottle of wine which was said to be a good deal and a glass of white wine. I can not vouch for either of those since I stuck to the Makers.  When the five of us were seated our waiter seemed a little.....out of it. We got some more drinks, and wine and ordered.  I ordered the selection of artisanal cheeses, which is a favorite. It arrived some time later with four types of cheese: A blue, two types of parmesan or romano and another which may or may not have been fontina. It was accompanied by crostini, some preserves and grapes. A nice little spread. Another glass of Makers Mark arrived with it as well. So far so good.  For my entree I chose something light, enabling the consumption of more Makers Mark. The tenderloin risotto with wild mushrooms was pretty exceptional. Perfectly cooked and expertly seasoned. I didn't eat all of it but did finish another glass of Makers Mark.    There was no dessert.  Other members of my party were getting quite loud at that point and we decided that it might be time to go since they weren't seating any more tables near us.   Overall the experience and food was great, drink superb and the prices here are really reasonable for the Vegas strip. My risotto was $20 and the cheese plate was $15. Cant remember the price of the Makers.  Waiter never quite had it together but whatever, it seemed like four stars at the time.",

The service was excellent to say the least.  I had the mixed seafood grill and was not disappointed. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly, the scallops were well seasoned and flavorful, and the giant prawn was one of the best I've ever had.

I don't know if drinks are usually served strong but that is how it came in my glass. Seemed like a busy spot, and well central to the Canal Shops.  We ordered the Oysters and Beef Carpaccio. Oysters were actually pretty delicious, I must say, as I am far from a fan of these pearl makers. I ate one up with some cocktail sauce and a hint of lemon and horseradish, so it wasn't a pure act of bravery, but it was good going down.  Beef Carpaccio was good, with the capers, arugula and cheese on top. I've had better myself, but it was far from worth complaining about.  Those are all I've tried at this spot but I wouldn't forego going again. Even though it was 9pm, we felt reenergized by the brightness of the ceiling and the pigeons that somehow snuck into the Canal Shops made it more authentic. Eating and drinking with friends at night in such an atmosphere was a nice touch.",

You feel the Italian aura right at the door, when one of the waiters yells, \"ciao bella, come estai? \" and some other hot italian phrases (Italian just sounds too hot *hot flashes*)   *puts some cold water on her face and comes back to review*   First thing is the great service; one greats you, one seats you, and one takes care of your food and you ....*ahem*  (romantic Italian music for soundtrack...)  I had very delicious dining experience at Canaletto because they have simply good food that smells great under the \"fake\" sky of the Venetian hotel.   They have their own baked bread, crunchy, and tastes great with virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our appetizer was Prosciutto and melon and parmigiano cheese. Good starter with rich smoked flavor of prosciutto and parmesan cheese with that golden melon, was very refreshing and prepares you well for the entrees.  We got proseccos. I have to confess; I love proseccos more than champaign, there! I said it. It's such a refreshing and pleasant wine-type that makes you love Italy even more. Doesn't have the bitterness of champaign, leaves a pleasant aftertaste and nice buzz for LV.  My main dish was seafood Pastizzio. Very drooling and very flavorful. Pink creamy sauce, with the seafood smell all over, baby clams, baby shrimps, mussels, and  scallops.  It's a great place to try as one of your restaurant explorations by being in LV and walking around the Venetian shoppe area, under that fake sky. (Which I can't get over it).  Arrivederci!  p.s. My group loved their food as well. I have picture to prove them.",

The prices are somewhat decent for Las Vegas, but you're in vegas just go win some money.  They also give you complimentary bread to eat with olive oil and vinegar?   I really recommend the POLIPO CON PATATE (Octopus with potato salad), Cristina pizza (Thin flat bread with proscuitto), and any of the risottos are a m a z i n g.  Pair them with some Riesling and you've got a great meal.  Came here hungover, left happy.  Also, the atmosphere is quite lively as some singing and shows happen during noon - pretty cool to eat with live entertainment.

Canaletto is situated in the Venetian Resort and Casino. It is located in the St. Marks Square. So if you are sitting outside in the courtyyard, you have that amazing view of St. Marks Square and of the singers that come out to sing every hour. If you happen to sit inside, you can definitely get a glimpse of the gondolas. The food and staff are amazing. That's something you will rarely hear from me that both are amazing. One of my favorite waiters there is Jean Carlos. If you ever get him, he's the best. Of course all the waiters, waitresses and staff are incredible. Now, the food is just breathtaking and full of genuine Italiano Flavor. What I would recommend is the seafood linguine or if they offer the risotto. The dessert is the signature of Canaletto which is their Tiramisu. Have I had any place make the best Tiramisu ever/??? Not as fresh and authentic as Canaletto. Come try the Italian Cuisine at Canaletto and it will be an experience you will never forget. I have been coming here since they first opened. This is truly a remarkable place.",

I was prepared for the worst because it was nearly 8pm on Christmas Day and I didn't have reservations. I walked up to the hostess and asked for a table for 5 at the patio because it's pretty there and they had carolers at the courtyard.   To make the long story short, despite that busy night, they were still able to seat us within 30 mins.  The service is awesome and their food , especially the rib eye is exceptional.   Amazingly, they also serve craft beer!!!  I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again!",

The service was excellent. The wine or water glasses were never empty and the food came out relatively quickly. My pasta and meatballs was pretty average. Nothing to write home about here. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and had a lovely time dining at this restaurant. I would recommend this place based on it's excellent view during dinner.",

The view was great too.   Service was prompt. They handled or drink orders in a timely manner. Refilled our drinks quick. Our food was brought out quickly too. Everything we ordered to share was delicious.   This place is a bit pricey, but that's to be expected being on the strip.   Would I recommend this place? Yes.

The drinks were a little pricey for my liking but they tasted amazing so it was hard to complain. But the food however, delicious. The names of the dishes are in Italian so be sure to read what follows or else you won exactly know what you're ordering. Everything was fresh and delicious. Thank goodness we saved this for the last day of our trip so I could take the leftovers.   Thanks open table for having such great restaurants listed in your app!",

I can't speak on the quality of their food because the service was so awful that we didn't even stick around to order.  When we approached the restaurant, the host at the front didn't even acknowledge us and we actually had to go out of our way for her attention. Once we got her attention she had a rude and passive aggressive tone throughout the entire exchange. She sat us down at our table without a word. Nothing. We waited at our table for our server for well over 15 minutes and we were not acknowledged once. We don't even know who our server was supposed to be because they never showed up! Eventually we decided we would not give these people our business and our money and decided to leave. Upon exiting, we passed the same host and about three servers talking amongst themselves, clearly adamant on not making eye contact with us.  I generally ALWAYS give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when it comes to bad service and have never given a negative review on here but this experience was absolutely ridiculous.  We ultimately had our dinner at the restaurant next door, Mercato della Pescheria, and were immediately met with welcoming and easy going staff. Our evening at Mercato was wonderful and the food was great. If you've made it this far into my review, don't waste your time at Canaletto and take your business to their neighbors at Mercato della Pescheria.",

Imagine my surprise when, instead of settling on the table in front of me, the gnocchi went sailing to the floor, splattering the back of my cream colored shirt with red sauce along the way.  These things happen and I understand that. But I would have expected a real apology and some form of make good from our huffy waiter, who acted genuinely upset with me for being in the way of my falling food. So I waited for a new plate of gnocchi to arrive and enjoyed the group's company. After we paid our $1500 bill, I walked over to my waiter and quietly asked if there was anything he could do for my shirt.  Here I'm thinking maybe $80 towards a new shirt, a comped bottle of their mediocre house red or even $10 to get the shirt cleaned properly. Guess what I got? A towel with some soda water and a little more attitude.  This incident notwithstanding, we had a fine meal Canaletto. But overall I'd agree wholeheartedly with previous reviewers: the ambiance here is pretty good, the food here is fine, the service poor and overall the prices are about 3x what they should be for this experience. If you're going to drop $100 or more per person for dinner, there are dozens of great options to choose from in Vegas... and I just can't see putting this place on the list.",

The inside of this restaurant is such a disappointment. It is comparable to a cafeteria but, with luxury pricing. We thought it would be romantic to sit inside. This is what we got... one side of the inside restaurant serves as a gateway to their outdoor seating. Waiters pass by  your booth like a human subway carting dirty dishes... its constant. So we moved to other side where the view of slobs, yes slobs are going back and forth to use the restrooms upstairs. What is wrong with people today? Its embarrassing and very distracting how people dress to eat a nice establishment. Throughout our meal we were subject to people using the inside of the restaurant  as a passage to the bathroom. Why does Canaletto even bother allowing sitting inside? Its just a well decorated corridor to the kitchen and the restrooms. We spent a lot of money and were so disappointed that I asked to see the manage who made us wait 20 minutes and then was so detached, no customer service skills and no interest in our disappointment. If he would have just offered us a cocktail we would have felt a bit better about wasting our money here. You do have better choices when it comes to dinner. In fact right next to Canaletto is a  much better experience.",

We had a separate room over looking the Square- er mall- and it was fine. The food was ok. Most of the steaks were overcooked and everything else was fine but nothing to write home about.

One of our favorite places in Las Vegas and we always make time to go.... love the Calamari and the Meatballs as appetizers, I love the pear ravioli and my husband loved the Canaloni. Love the ambiance - a charming place in the middle of the hustle and bustle of The Venetian!",

At last, we look at the menu and decided this was going to be our dinner one night.  We sat down inside and waited about 15 mintues before we were asked what we would like to drink.  We ordered:  CAPRESE Sliced vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil, drizzled with basil-infused extra-virgin olive oil 10.99   CALZONE Folded pizza filled with mozzarella, mushrooms, ricotta, ham and tomato sauce 15.59  LINGUINE ALLA BURANELLA Thin flat pasta with mussels, prawns, scallops and clams seasoned with tomatoes,crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine 24.99  and of course we received sample bread with a balsamic vinegar oil.  The waiter never asked if we were okay or needed anything else after ordering.  The linguine had very little sauce which made you tasting mosty just plain pasta.  Glad I went her eto make a dream come True but wont be back.",

First he never offered us any drinks after the bread was brought out it was about 10 mins before we were brought water. When the appetizers came out this guy was not being careful what so ever and was holding the platter by my mother in laws head where she had to lean to the side and when she did he brought the plate even closer to her ears. Barely checked up on us at all throughout the dinner. And all through out the dinner he never offered us drinks! At least we got water I guess..",

    "text": "GREAT Service - our server was wonderful - attentive, but not hovering.  Canaletto is part of the Il Fornaio empire. Not a big deal to most, but if you do not like chains, just be aware.   The Canaletto menu was extensive, and did indeed remind us of an Il Fornaio. We visited as part of a school reunion group and the venue had several large tables so they were obviously well-equipped to handle larger parties. We were seated within the restaurant near the salad station and stairs to the restroom - it doesn't sound very nice, but it was surprisingly quiet and allowed everyone at the table to catch up and reminisce without having to shout, which was wonderful!  Again, our service - unfortunately I can't recall his name, but he was great.   We started with an Insalata di Pere (Arugula, radicchio, frisee, Belgian endive, grilled pears, grapes, blue cheese, toasted pecans, pomegranate dressing). The salad was nicely dressed and had a good flavor, but the pears were hard to find and the sweet of the fruit and dressing was not able to overcome (or even complement) the bitter of the greens.   Next, the gnocchi Bolognese (Potato dumplings with traditional meat ragu). The Bolognese sauce was lovely, but I had a bit of an issue with the size of the gnocchi - I realize that this is completely subjective, but they were too large. About double the size of traditional gnocchi (aka bize-size), I found myself having to cut them in two after stuffing the first whole piece in my mouth and fumbling to chew while looking like a chipmunk loaded down with nuts for the winter. Dainty and elegant, I was decidedly not.  Overall, a nice place and good food but with several other Italian options (hello, Otto and B&B) just steps away, Canaletto comes in a distant third.",

Our actual XMas dinner was on Sat Night and about 150 of us had reservations for Canaletto \"Buffet Style\"  It was weird. Walking into the building from palazzo to venetian was crazy. The area in which Canaletto is located, has high ceilings painted like a Sky with Clouds, the common area looked like a street with Italian Canal, and the restaurant as if on a street in Italy. Buttttt.... No Smoking (even though its made to look and feel like youre outdoors).  At the restaurant, we started in the private rooms upstairs for open bar and cocktails with hors d'oeuvres. then downstairs where the entire restaurant was closed for us, and we got to eating.  No joke the food was ok. just ok. we had a selection of chicken, salad, beef, and fish. and like i said, it was ok. Cooked correctly, seasoned correctly. but basic.  I didnt feel it being better than usual.   but great staff. all friendly, willing to help and answer questions.",

They were very accommodating with my dish -- I got the pasta ribbons, omitting the bacon and switching the cream sauce for tomato.  It was pretty good, though the pasta wasn't all that tender and the tomato sauce a bit salty.  But hey, I made the substitutions, so it's not the dish the chef means to serve, I guess.  I'm just happy that there was the option.  The amount of bread they give is very generous.  Service was nice but not particularly warm or anything.",

TWO HOURS later we FINALLY get our server to bring check (even though we gave up on eating the crap after 20 minutes... we still had to wait for her to come around).  We asked for separate checks, and she acts all flustered, and takes ANOTHER 40 minutes to bring us the split checks. We each just ordered ONE Thing; why is that so hard?!?!

Pizza, drink, appetizer and salads are all 7 bucks each. So if you've had a long day of shopping or lost you rear at the table--eat here. The pizza was a notch above the unfrozen kind they sale at the grocery store and the bruschetta was bland. But here's the kicker. The wine or cocktails are also only 7 and they have some good choices. You are on the \"street\" at the venetians mall which gives you lots to look at. I recommend for a quick bite if you don't want an amazing experience but want good drinks, okay food and a great price.",

Beautifully located in the middle of a huge courtyard inside the Venetian Shopping Center, it's a great scenery to have during your meal. On top of that, there is a stage/platform where performers will sing and act in the center of the courtyard.  Now for the food: Complimentary bread with oil and vinaigrette - 4 out of 5 stars. Main courses: Tagliatelle and Risotto beef tenderloin.   The Tagliatelle was decent. Pasta cooked well, a bit on the heavy side for cream sauce, and the pork was pretty dry - over cooked. I'd give it a 2.5 out of 5. The Risotto could have been in the pan a bit longer in my opinion. Other than that, it was delicious and the blend worked really well. Needless to say, I ate every grain on my plate.  Service was good, friendly, and comfortable. My only flaw in service was that I had to wait a few times for my water to be refilled.   Overall, a lot of options for pasta and antipasto to choose from, beautiful \"outdoor\" scenery, and friendly service. If you are looking for a relaxing meal, definitely dine here.",

Canaletto is located among the shops and restaurants of the Venetian Resort.  In True Las Vegas style, the Venetian has turned an ordinary shopping mall into what appears to be an outdoor Italian village.  The main square, a nod to the real St. Mark's Piazza in Venice, is filled with musicians, painters, gondolas, and even a gelato stand.  There are three restaurants located along this square.  Canaletto has scored the best location to people watch and enjoy all the activities the square has to offer.  The food is, of course, Italian inspired with lots of pizza and pasta on the menu.  Pizza okay, crust was good and chewy, sausage and peppers just okay.  The pasta with mushrooms and a brandy cream sauce was pretty good, but not killer.    Most of the entrees are priced within reason, keeping in mind that these are resort prices.  After all, you are dining in Italy, I mean Vegas.  I'd give this place three stars for the food.  But it rightly deserves a fourth star for the unique and fun ambiance.",

I guess it was something about the ink mixed with the red wine, it just did NOT sit well.  As for the other 'inkless' items on the menu, they were delicious!

I ordered the Beef Risotto and my boyfriend ordered the Cannelloni Di Pollo.   I expected a lot from my Beef Risotto since it was priced around $20 for a very small portion of food. The beef was probably the only highlight to the risotto. I did not like the wine sauce that it came with and the risotto tasted hard and not cooked thoroughly. I think I enjoyed eating my boyfriend's food more than my own. His order of the Cannelloni Di Pollo was overwhelmingly cheesy but the chicken and the marinara sauce was good.   The service here is the main reason why I give this place only two stars. It was really really pain stakingly SLOW (I even emphasized to our waiter that we had a show to catch!). We were in such a rush to catch our show and almost missed it because of how slow the service was. We waited 15 minutes for someone to bring us our bill and towards the end we just walked up to pay for the meal.  I probably won't come back to this place since there are so many better restaurants in Vegas. But I guess if you have all the time in the world and want to pay for overpriced risotto you can give this place a shot.",

We were seated on the outside part of the restaurant so we could watch the performances going on every 15 minutes or so it seemed like. In the middle of the meal there was a performance lady in one of the fake balcony's above the restaurant that started singing opera, which was kind of weird and oddly cool at the same time.   We started off with the 'tempura' vegetables and it was really good actually. Yes this place is italian so technically they are fried vegetables but it reminded me of vegetable tempura! Anyways, some good variety including eggplant, asparagus, and the best one of them all: the artichokes. I would've been happy with a full plate of these fried artichokes as they were super tasty and light. For the main course, I had the seafood pasta with tomato sauce. Wow the pasta was definitely al dente, it was really well done although the seafood components weren't special. I couldn't even tell if they were fresh seafood or not; I think the pasta stood out more than the seafood and that's not a good thing. Service could've been better as well, food took much longer than expected and drinks took a while.  Food: 3 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): n/a",

The view was beautiful from where we were sitting, it is a great mock up of St. Mark's Square in Venice. Such a great place to people watch too.   Service was great. From our server to the manager Stefano, everyone was very attentive and friendly.   I had a very nice and stiff Negroni to start and for food we started with the salumeria assortita, which was very good! We also had the beef carpaccio which was fresh I liked that it had capers, not a lot of places do that. My favorite thing was probably the Gorgonzola polenta with truffle oil and meatballs. So so so so good!!! Get this and you will not regret it!!!   Essentially we were there celebrating my sisters birthday for the weekend. Our server must have overheard us talking about it or perhaps when we cheersed our drink because at the end of our meal he brought over a tiramisu with a candle on it!  We were all trying to figure out who told the server that it was her birthday lol that was such a nice gesture and came to all of us as a surprise!  We had an excellent time here... I would love to check it out again for entrees next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here for their happy hour (4-6pm) - $7 appetizers, pizzas, cocktails and prosecco.   Happy hour is served only at the bar or high tops. Unfortunately, they work on a first-come-first-serve basis - the hostess just pointed over to the bar, which was all full. This left us standing around awkwardly trying to figure out which table was closest to being done, and then doing the super annoying hover. Except hovering doesn't work well when the only spaces are the ones by the \"real\" tables and are filled with waiters bringing food out. There has to be a better system than that. A group in front of us decided not to wait, leaving my group of 3 with a roughly 10 min wait.  Okay now the important part: the food.  We ordered...  Carpaccio with arugula and capers: this was really tasty. There were maybe 10 slices of beef. Very tasty. Worth $7. 5/5  Octopus with potato: octopus was very tender, very tasty and again, very much worth $7. 5/5  Calamari: served with both a marinara and aioli. The polenta it comes with is a bit tasteless. This one was not much to write home about. Tender, but the type of dish that can be found in many places. 4/5  Salsiccia (sp?) pizza: meh. 2.5/5  Rosso delizioso cocktail: rum-based and fruity - very good balance of alcohol and sweetness. But I'm someone who likes alcohol on the lighter side.   Overall: portions were much better than we had expected, and this amount (plus bread basket) was enough to fill up 3 people very comfortably. Came to $37 for 3 people making this a very affordable option in Vegas without resorting to fast food.",

There was barely any room to move around, and seating was limited. Fine. Not necessarily the fault of the restaurant - could have been the organizers - that may have over invited guests.   The dinner started at 7:30. Our orders were taken by 8:15ish.  Our food didn't start coming out until 9:30. I mean really? It was a price fixed menu. The salad was already selected, and we only had a choice between 4 entrees. We were told by the waiter that we couldn't make any substitutions. During the long wait time, it was next to impossible to get an initial drink, let alone a refill.   One of my sons got the salmon, it lacked any salt whatsoever and was grossly over cooked. I opted for the veal. The portion was small, and it was impossible to cut and chew. Also flavorless. They tried to make it look fancy by putting a cold glob of mozzarella cheese, and a piece of eggplant on top - but it couldn't hide the mediocrity. My wife had the roasted chicken - extremely dry.   Thank god the meal was free. Had I paid for food this terrible, especially after waiting so long, I would have lost it.",

Failed to ask us if we wanted drinks, took our order and literally never checked on us again. When she brought the bill she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or anything else, never filled our waters, and when I asked for a box to go she said she would get it and never returned. Another server took my food and actually boxed it up for me. The food was good, but for zero service from the staff we will never go back. Avoid this place at all costs unless you want to sit and wait for just about nothing. If you're going to have garbage service, at least have amazing food to balance it out. Never again Canaletto...never again!!!",

    "text": "So I was lucky enough to be able to accompany my friend to a private dinner here. And the menu was pre-fixe, except you could choose what your entree was and one of two desserts. The menu was as follows: -Insalata Di Pere: Arugula, radicchio, frisee, Belgian endive, grilled pears, grapes, blue cheese, toasted pecans, pomegranate dressing (delicious) -Risotto Sant Erasmo: Risotto of fresh shrimp and baby artichoke (this should have been my most favorite dish out of anything we were served, but the rice was about 2 minutes away from being done [tough interior] and the shrimp were those mealy little things that are not good for anything aside from pureeing into a paste) -My entree choice was Pesce Speciale Del Giorno: (fresh fish of the day which was Sea Bass) served with roasted potatoes and sauteed vegetables. (this was delicious and prepared extremely well, if not a bit boring) -Sgroppino lemon sorbet, prosecco, vodka and cream (a delicious little drink) -My dessert choice was the Cannoli Siciliani: cannoli filled with sheep's milk ricotta, candied orange, bittersweet chocolate and pistachio. (while I appreciated the detail by which they did not pre-fill the shells so they stayed crisp, the filling was unfortunate. Thick, dry, and with far too much orange peel.  Basically, this was a so-so meal that was made better by the fact that I didn't have to pay for it, haha. It really was more like dining at an upscale wedding, everything just OK, but on the extremely unadventurous side to please multiple palates. Hopefully their regular menu is better, seems like it might be based on the pictures posted here.",

Natasha our event planner was outstanding - from A to Z, no request was too big, she accommodated us with everything and we felt like superstars - we did a champagne and cake toast with food there and we were looked after so well and the food, ambience, service and amenities were amazing. Thank you Natasha and team, unforgettable!!!",

I made a reservation for 5:15 and was seated promptly when I arrived at a two top table on the patio where I had a good view of the Venetian's \"street performers\" and the tourists walking by.  I was quickly brought a nice bread basket--more than enough for one person--and the server asked if I wanted balsamic and olive oil.  Declining the balsamic, I went with the olive oil and put some salt in it for the extra flavor I like.  I asked about the soup of the day and it was broccolini and that sounded good so I ordered that.  For the main course, I got their three pasta dish with pennoni al ragu, house-made ravioli filled with roasted pear, and pesto gnocchi.  My two favorites were the tubes topped with ragu sauce and the ravioli.  There was a bit of tomato/water mixture from not draining completely but I was surprised how much I liked the traditional meat ragu.  The ravioli were very good, also, and they had a very nice flavor given the pear filling, something I wouldn't expect in pasta.  The gnocchi were the least favorite of the trio.  They were heavier than I like them and the pesto sauce was lacking.  For dessert, I got a wonderful lime tart that had a tasty cookie crumb base.  These are Strip prices but not as bad as one sees some places.",

This does not go down well with the well oiled members of the tourist hordes; lots of negative interpersonal action.

Three of us decided to share our dishes so that we can get a taste of everything that sounded good so we skipped out on ordering appetizers.  { ORDER } * Risotto Con Secoe e Funghi - risotto with beef tenderloin and mushrooms in a white wine sauce (it was a bit salty) ** Linguine Alla Buranella - linguini with seafood in a red tomato sauce - yummy! ** Tagliatelle Alla Castellana - Fettuccine pasta tossed with pork, bacon, shitake mushrooms in a white cream sauce - a great selection as well!  { ENVIRONMENT } I think sitting outside in the patio is better since you have a view of the canal as well as the beautiful \"sky\".  We sat inside as they didn't have any large tables in the patio area.  { TIP } For large parties, always book at least 1 week in advance. The restroom is upstairs.  If your heels can't take the stairs, they have an elevator.  The portions here are a lot bigger than Mario Batali's and you can't really go wrong with an Il Fornaio-restaurant.",

The spot is convenient if staying at The Venetian or Palazzo, but also convenient if you want to see the canal area there. I made a reservation on Open Table and had a nice hightop table awaiting me upon arrival. My sever was attentive and brought True Italian style to his work (calling me \"Bella\" and using other Italian phrases). They provided bread and olive oil with balsamic on the table, but the bread felt and tasted old. I started with a cypress salad and it was just OK. I then opted for the four cheese gnocchi at the waiter's suggestion, and while they did melt in my mouth, I wasn't thrilled with the green bean bits throughout the sauce. I finished with the cannoli - I have had better, and it was four mini ones versus a big one. All in all, three star meal.",

For larger groups they will arrange a specific dinning menu for you if you desire one.  They do a nice job catering to groups in their private dinning area which is nice and cozy for small to medium sized groups of people.  Their food is usually very good and they have a great wine selection.   Regular Dinning~ is 2 stars due to the service you get and the quality of the dinning experience does not hit the mark for what you are expecting.  Our food comes out at varying temps, so we had to send something back twice.  The pasta's dishes are very good but we had their marghetta pizza and their salamone alla griglia.  The pizza was not to temp so we wound up eating the salmone dish first then finishing the pizza later. Our server did not try to make amends with their error.    Me to you ~ this is a very good place to dine if you have a small group and are looking for a place that is cozy and won't cost an arm and leg.  If you're dinning for two, you may consider trying this place or going somewhere else.",

You can may choose to sit in the exterior atrium (and stare at the fun faux-clouds) area or in the more intimate interior section. The views of of the Grand Canal and gondolas passing are quite relaxing especially when you may have had your fill on the over-the-top excess of Vegas.  We had a party of 9 without reservations, yet they efficiently seated us at a nice table in the interior area. Service was good and the server was very helpful with making suggestions for my vegan diet too. Wine by the glass is affordable. I ordered up a tasty Chianti for around $11 to pair with my salad which was the Insalata Di Pere ($10.99) that was comprised of arugula,, radicchio, frisee, grilled pears, grapes, Belgian endive, toasted pecans, and crumbled blue cheese which I excluded. It was a fantastic start to my meal. The fresh array of breads was replenished throughout the meal can be a danger zone as you can fill up pretty quickly if you're not careful....  My main course was the Barilotti Integrali Al Forno and did not disappoint with whole wheat barrel-shaped pasta,chopped eggplant, garlic, peperoncino, tomato sauce and fresh basil. With my vegan diet, I excluded the smoked mozzarella but with all the other fresh flavors, I didn't miss the cheese at all!  What a solid meal. Cheers!",

    "text": "There is definitely no shortage of Italian restaurants in Vegas and  I can't exactly compare my experience at Canaletto to other places due to this being only my second trip to Sin City.  What I can say however, is that they provide a solid experience both in service and in the actual meal.  We went ahead and reserved a seat on Open Table, but in retrospect it does not seem necessary.  While busy, there did not appear to be a wait (6 PM.).  I guess I'm easily impressed because my waiter could pronounce everything on the menu.  This may not seem like some great feat, but my Indian father and I were butchering the menu like nobody's business.  I was equally as impressed by the prompt service and courteousness of every member of the staff.   Now on to the food.  My father got what was essentially a fish stew and he was very pleased.  It was definitely a seafood smorgasbord.  From prawns to shrimp to clams, there was definitely nothing left to want.  I had already partaken in a monster meal at Carnegie deli earlier that day, so I was not interested in one of the heavier meals.  I chose the vermicelli al pomodoro and it was exactly the light meal I was looking for.  The pasta was tossed in a light tomato and olive oil sauce that was very tasty while not being overbearing.    As I mentioned earlier and other reviewers have said, there is a plethora of Italian food in Las Vegas; specifically in the Shops at the Venetian.  With my limited knowledge, I wholeheartedly recommend Canaletto.",

There's even gondoliers around and a canal.Actually the \"real\" Venice is much weirder( Don't Look Now- doesn't strike me as that off).But that's ok .The food is pretty good and the service pleasant.I had Branzino filet and wife had Salmon.It was one of the few times on the trip I sprung for a bottle of wine- overpriced Princepessa Gavi.We followed with desert and expresso.Main courses are served with vegetables and potatoes.One big plus is you are not blasted by overamplified, wretched pop music of the young woman screams and ululates about how much she's in love and  castrati  do likewise type.Las Vegas is too noisy !This was nice.",

It was really tasty and the portion size was nice. For dessert, I ordered the line tart. This felt like it was pre-made, and it could have used more of a zesty lime flavor since it was a bit on the bland side. Overall, a very decent meal with a good wait staff.",

    "text": "It is truly a sin to call this Italian food. With all the good dining options in Vegas my only excuse for ending up here was sheer exhaustion from traveling and not doing my homework before we set out for dinner.   To go with the bread, the waiter poured out olive oil onto a plate. And out came a small insect onto the plate. He apologized profusely and frankly I was too tired to care and he got us new olive oil. It went downhill from there. I ordered cannelloni and it was the worst I've ever had. I was very hungry and could only eat about a quarter if it. The risotto also has a bad flavor and was hardly edible.   The good news is that every meal we had in Vegas after this one was delicious. Since it was our first meal in town, Canaletto could not have set the bar any lower.",

I ordered the   SALMONE ALLA GRIGLIA - chinook salmon fillet grilled with lemon-oil and parsley sauce; served with roasted yukon gold potatoes and sauteed seasonal vegetables.  With our meal came the bread, salad and tiramisu for dessert  Salmon was tasty, potatoes were cooked to perfection and seasoned well... I just didn't think it was worth $50... especially when the service was slow.  We had one server for our party of 20...... We had a private room for our party.......it was nice and intimate.  The server did everything, but it seemed like he really wasn't there.  They should have had an extra server so they could cater to us...... oh well.   If you don't mind the price, its worth a try.",

    "text": "Pro: great view from second floor; clean establishment including bathroom.  Cons: poor staffing: for a group of fourteen (reserved in advanced with a menu of pre-selected items) we had only had one waiter.  It looked like our waiter also had another big group of people by himself. Service took forever. Waiter was nice enough, but appears to be set up to fail by management.   Food: underwhelming. Costata di Manzo alla Griglia - ordered steak as medium rare, but arrived over cooked and tasted like rubber.  Vegetarian entree - Casonzei con Stracchino  e Perre tasted exactly like the Pennette all Vodka that was served first. Salmone Alla Griglia was the only palatable entree.   Food appeared to be cooked hours in advance. All entrees received were barely warm. The bread was delish! So no surprise there considering this place is owned by Il Fornaio. That being said, I've eaten at Il Fornaio in Southern California in Pasadena and Irvine, but the entrees were much much better at these locations. I agree with other sentiments posted here - tourist trap with no incentive to change the quality of their food and/or behavior.",

    "text": "I really liked the location and atmosphere of this restaurant!   They have A LOT of seating available.   This place is located in the beautiful Grand Canal Shoppes ...  and there is also a free stage show,  that I randomly passed by.  People were dressed in costumes like from the Renaissance!   After a few hours of shopping and walking,  I thought this would be a great place to take a break and eat.  I got the impression that the hostess was new because after she seated me at my table,  I had to move!?!  Then a few minutes later,  a couple nearby ended up moving to a different table too.  The time was afternoon,  so lunch rush was over and dinner hadn't started yet,  but it was still busy.  I definitely wanted a drink,  so ended up at the bar and changed my mind not to order food.   They seemed disorganized and I didn't have a comfortable feeling, thinking a one hour lunch might turn into 2 hours lunch ... Whilst I still had a lot of plans for later.  Drinks were very expensive, but that's okay,  I was on vacation and only care to enjoy my time and new experience.   I got two bartenders,  one was friendly and cool, the other was a jerk!!  I guess he was having a bad day and got impatient when I couldn't decide on my drink choice.  Plus he made my drink wrong, he forgot to put the fresh Strawberries!!!  I didn't say anything because it tasted great and it had a good amount of alcohol.   So, when the nice bartender came over,  I ordered dessert.   It was a lovely dessert with a Bellini sorbet, blackberries, baicoli cookies, and cream, very delicious.   I'm glad I did not order food,  since how my first experience started off there with the hostess and server.  I paid and left a big tip, hopefully both bartenders shared it but who knows ?  I was happy and enjoying my day, can't help it when others are negative,  maybe the extra tip % cheered up the moody bartender ;)   I love the Venetian and Grand Canal Shoppes,  I practically came here almost every day of my week vacation in Vegas!   Hopefully next time I can actually get nice service and a great meal.",

I LOST MY APPETITE after this. So I go to the restroom and it smells of complete marijuana! I got to the next stall.... blood all over the toilet seat! So I was forced to inhale the polluted air and in doing so I vomited the little food that I DID eat! I come back to a $250 dollar bill with BOTH of my returned meals on it! I was furious! Especially after vomiting the little food I did eat. This place literally made me sick! When I informed someone of the mess and smell in the restroom... they responded with \"okay\" and just gave me a dead stare.

We ordered their formaggi misti in which the waiter did not stop to appropriately go through what kind of cheese it had. This was a bit of a disappointment. As the evening progressed we ordered one of their Pinot Grigio from Ca which was delicious. We also ordered their Bruschetta which was not bad as well. Despite it being busy the waiter was kind enough to come check in on us. The Risotto was probably one of their best dishes and I do recommend starting there.   If you are looking for a pretty restaurant to dine in at the Venetian this is your spot. The location is probably one of the best in St. Marks Square and I honestly can't say it offers much else and their food is average.",

I Give em 4 stars because of the outdoor seating alongside St Marks Square and because of my girlfriend being the one I was having dinner with. Of course all the time I am with her it's an experience of 10 stars.   Anyway this place was more like 3 stars, was expecting more. Maybe it was the weird plastic chairs or the food that just came out a little too quick. Hmmmm..... The pizza we had that came topped with Asparagus n Artichokes was average to say the least. The Castellagna pasta dish was a lil better than the pizza. But the star of the show had to be the salmon dish my chick ordered. Now that was a tasty piece of fish! Couple glasses of white wine which washed away of the taste of my mouth of a 20 dollar pasta dish that I think I could have made much better.   It is Vegas after all, lots of foreigners so they must cater to them cause thats who we had sitting around us. At least the service was pretty good, that maybe was the best of the dining experience.

I was with a large bachelorette party, so they were able to take all of us (which is huge) and we had a private room.  We had a pre-set menu, so we had a limited selection.  I found my salmon to be a little overdone, but considering that they had to get 25 meals out at the same time, they did a pretty decent job.  Canaletto is a great place for a large party.  There is a big bar upstairs that is a great place to have pre-dinner cocktails and a few private rooms for dining.",

I found it annoying to have to yell to talk to my friends at lunch over the stupid show going on right beside the restaurant.   Service was SLOW  Bread basket was off the hook (yes, I'm easily impressed). I got the pizza christina. The ingredient mixture was killer - proscuitto, a special italian cheese,mushrooms, white truffle oil. Perfection I tell you. The crust was pretty generic, however. It was that thin crust that every \"authentic\" Italian place has. That ingredient combo on a Settebello pizza would be so killer!",

I had the ravioli while my husband had the brazino. The food was good - worthy of at least 3.5 stars but the service was horrible. We asked our waiter to recommend a white wine. He mumbled a few things and then brought us a tasting on a white wine. It was nice so he filled our glasses. He never asked if we wanted just a glass or a bottle. Midway through the meal, our glasses were empty but no one ever asked us if we wanted another glass of wine. For the price, I expect way better service. With all of the restaurants in Las Vegas, there are way better options than this.",

Pasta was cooked just right and it was delicious. Seasoning was just right, little on the plain side for some folks but I like it that way and of course, it's always better than TOO salty.  Wine: They had our usual Port which is Fonseca Bin 27. I strongly recommend it after pasta =)  Atmosphere: Great! had holiday music and ton of ppl. Loved it. I did find it a bit strange to hear the musicians play Chinese National Anthem TWICE to please large crowd of Chinese tourist.No offense but I Had mad urge to request God Bless America and Star Spangled Banner 10 times. Should've seen them... crazy clapping and everything yo  -  _____ -  Location: It can't be beat. We went 3 times during our stay for dinner and lunch after shopping and walking all day.

    "text": "We had originally wanted to go to Bouchon but since it was a two hour wait we walked around the Venetian and found Canaletto.  Having walked by here numerous times and having never been here I was happy to give this place a chance since it meant I have a new place to yelp about.  To start off with the waiter was rather weird.  He was snobbish, walked around like he had something better to do, and acted like our questions were a waste of his time.  Well anyway that's how the gf and I felt but since we didn't want any extra surprises in our food we just let it go.    The table ordered a variety of pastas and gf and I ordered squid ink risotto, bruschetta, and calamari to share.  The latter was original, nothing bad and nothing great.  The bruschetta was pretty good but it isn't hard to make decent bruschetta.  The squid ink risotto was decent.  I found the seafood in the dish to be so so, it wasn't piping hot or anything but overall the dish was decent.  Now back to the waiter.  Somehow after I ordered the dish and started eating it, he started being nice to me and asking me how I like it, if I've had it, and even coming over and asking me and me only if we needed anything else.  To sum it up, I felt that he out of nowhere started respecting me or that I suddenly joined some kind of Italian dining cult because of my knowledge and liking of squid ink risotto.  (Just an fyi if he's reading, he has no idea how extensive my palate is, don't even try challenging me).    Anyway Canaletto is in the area of St. Mark's Square.  With Otto and Postrio next door, there is patio seating where you can enjoy the faux blue sky of the Venetian roof and also enjoy the entertainment the hotel provides.  I'd probably not come back because there are just too many places to eat in Las Vegas.",

Our group wanted a nice semi-fancy venue to dine at without the overpriced menu, so we stumbled upon this place during a random stroll across the Venetian. Typical Italian menu, but I was more impressed with the specials. Remember to always ask for the specials! I ended up ordering the lobster stuffed ravioli in a cream sauce and it was splendid. 6 huge pieces of ravioli was the perfect portion before a night a drunken debauchery. My friends ordered the blackened salmon (a little too blackened, if you asked me) and halibut (cooked perfectly). Our tab was about $30/person, which isn't bad when you're trying to eat fancy in Vegas.  I wasn't too impressed with the service. Our waiter was friendly and helpful when we were deciding what to order, but he didn't check up on us or offer any other assistance until dessert. I even had to ask 2 people for water before our glasses were refilled. Big negative mark in my book for that one. I might come back, but I'm sure there's better Italian restaurants to try in Vegas.",

We came in with high expectations as it was recommended by the hotel staff.  Ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizer, calamari was decent but nothing special and the bruschetta was probably the worst I ever had.   The bread was ok, but the tomatoes were salty, and they are warmed in the oven making it mushy, more salty and yucky.  enough said, not good.  0-2 for entrees we shared a margherito pizza which was pretty decent, and a seafood entree.  The pasta was hard, very undercooked, especially for my taste, seafood was plenty but the taste and sauce were lacking.   Dessert time, italian restaurants usually have decent desserts, coffee and tea were ok but took a while.  The tiramisu, came about 10 minutes before drinks, and it didnt look appetizing at all, it taste just as bad as it looked.  There was no flavor, wow, I wasted 8 bucks on lady finger cookies with cream.  Horrible, so, is it the worst in the world, no, but for the price and in Vegas there are many options.  We were so dissapointed that went to Otto next door the following night and had a much better, italian meal.  I wouldnt return to this place for free, and wouldnt recommend anyone going.  Worst than olive garden.  The chef should be ashamed of his food.",

Rich and creamy but still light enough to eat and be full of energy for dancing later :)  Our cocktails were great, the service was fantastic.  The only thing lacking was the ambiance.  They sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, so it was loud and pretty hot.  The service however, more than made up for it, as they were extra attentive because our table was out of the way and turned the AC up full blast on our request.    Definitely a great pick if you need a last minute reservation for a high quality Italian meal at the Venetian.  Expansive menu, great service and an exceptional value.",

You're in Vegas so trust me, you don't want to sit outside anyway.  Canaletto is what it is. Decent food and interesting atmosphere that costs more than it actually delivers. I've been here a few times and by Vegas standards its not too expensive. However I certainly wouldn't pay $9 for a small dinner sized salad at home, especially given that they were pretty skimpy on the blue cheese. But I've never watched anyone get married at my local Italian restaurant, so....  I would absolutely dine here again....sharing a bottle of wine, app and a salad make for a restful break before hitting the real outdoors again.",

The ambiance was great, service was excellent and the food was outstanding. She had the salmon and I had the veal scallopini. The best part of the meal however was the bread. The waiter said it was fresh from the bakery next door. Overall the meal was excellent, and It was reasonbly priced for vegas standards, I think 65 bucks with tip for 2, but we split a salad and a calamari, but had no drinks or desserts. It was still wonderful. I highly reccomend it, for anyone.",

But also nothing that made it stand out, other than location. It was great to set a romantic mood but I honestly did not take away any WOWs from this place. Got to ride the Gondolas in the same building so that deserves a + i guess",

    "text": "We visited Canaletto on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar for our dinner. That's what we, as parents, do when we don't have children with us. Still, we were able to enjoy the musical entertainment in the square, while also being able to catch the playoff game on the television.   We ordered a red blend Sangiovese bottle to start. Our server, Xavier, was fantastic and very patient with us. From being pulled away from the bar or being indecisive on the amazing menu. You know that you're in the best place for dinner when no one rushes an order out of you.   We decided to have the calamari appetizer. It was served with a spicy marinara sauce, as well as tarter sauce. Options! We love options! The calamari was marinated in a flour/milk mixture to evenly distribute the flour ahead of time so it was fried to perfection. Seriously, the rings looked perfect. But, we had started filling up on the bread and oil/balsamic dip, that we only ate about half. Such a waste, but our appetites are only so big.  For our main course, my husband wanted something light and ordered the minestrone soup. However, the restaurant had just served a large party upstairs and had run out of the soup. The kitchen offered to make him a lobster bisque. While, I don't eat shellfish, he said it was a very good, red bisque with chunks of lobster meat. There was a large crouton of Italian bread floating in the middle. He very much enjoyed his special dinner.   I ordered the homemade formaggi gnocchi. It had a four cheese sauce with Gorgonzola, stracchino, grana padano and cream. There were small pieces of asparagus mixed in, as well as added chicken that Xavier suggested. The gnocchi was tender, cooked to perfection and was \"melt in the mouth\" delicious. The combination of it with the sauce made it some of the best gnocchi I've had. It's inspired me to go home and perfect my own gnocchi!   Thank you for the perfect dinner for our last night in Vegas. We'll be back!",

The breads served at the beginning of the meal were just as delicious as I had remembered.  The bruschetta was good tasting, packed with a generous amount of the tomato mixture.  The calamari fritti was not crispy enough though the taste was there.  The minestrone soup was on the bland side.  The spaghetti with lobster and the ribeye entrees were delicious, very generous in portion, and fairly priced (for Las Vegas).  The wife's pasta with salmon (the special of the night) was just ok.  Service started out fine but then our server rarely came back.  It seems he was more interested in waiting on people he knew.  We did not order dessert as we were so full from the rest of the meal!",

    "text": "With St.Mark's Square being the entertaining spot of the Grand Canal Shoppes, the restaurants and cafes' surrounding the square all seem to have a \"patio\" area, or windows that overlook the stage; this area is great for people watching and enjoying the atmosphere around the Venetian, giving you a little slice of feeling like you're in Macau. All the eateries around here seem to be more Italian. Canaletto was chosen off a whim, we were hungry and decided to go to the one that looked busiest. (ikr.)   Offering refined Italian dining, with a very extensive menu ranging from charcuterie to pizza to pasta. Sure to satisfy anyone in your party I suppose. We came for lunch and there was a lunch menu offering a 3 course option for a set price, giving you options to choose from for you starter,entree and dessert.   Insalata Canaletto - Mixed greens was basically just iceberg lettuce doused with house vinaigrette. I usually get my dressing on the side but didn't think twice about it. Way too overdressed. With a thin slice of cheese just plopped on top, what presentation..   Pollo Allo Spiedo  - A slice of rotisserie chicken accompanied by roasted potatoes and sauteed vegetables. Chicken was moist and the sauce that was tangy. Not bad.   Steak dish is not on their regular menu- But basically 6oz of overcooked steak, that was barely trimmed for fat. Ordered for medium rare, came with charred burnt edges and completely cooked through. Basically chewing on rubber.  Salmone Alla Griglia - Grilled salmon fillet with a lemon-parsley sauce served with potatoes and vegetables as well. I actually really enjoyed this. Fish was cooked nicely, flaked to the touch and the lemon-parsley sauce went really well with the salmon fishy taste that gave a nice cut of fresh acidity. Consistency between all three dishes flavor wise was the underwhelming amount of seasoning that went through each dish. We ended up asking for a ketchup bottle to finish off our entrees.   Followed by dessert, Vanilla gelato and two Tiramisus'. Eh. To finish off the underwhelming meal with an equally underwhelming dessert.. Why not. Basically a tourist trap being situated in the middle of the mall overlooking the square- tourists are the only ones that would come because I don't see any reason to revisit this eatery at all.",

The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with two indoor levels, and one 'outdoor' patio-style seating in the grand canal shoppes. Most patrons and us were seated in the patio. The inside is very royally decorated, with a dark & quiet ambiance more suited for intimate occasions, while the outside has the noisy crowd.  The service here was outstanding. We were a large group of 10, and they were able provide flawless service unlike some of our other experience in vegas, even though it was pretty crowded there. Our server was very efficient and courteous, and recommended some great wines for us.  The food was great here. We got a few pizzas, from which the margherita was the highlight, as well as some pastas to share. The gnocchi was really good, but the risotto was just alright, not too great. The portions here are meagre, so the prices here felt pretty high for the food.  This is a great restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend going out of the way for this one. It's a nice option if you're already at the venetian, specially later in the evening when other restaurants have closed.",

    "text": "I know it's the Venetian and all the food inside is super pricey, but there are some gems in here that really make it worth having at least once.  We were having a meal with our company so I didn't personally pay for things other than my own, so I sampled most of the dishes and here's what we got:  Antipasto /Appetizers: Bruschetta: the tomatoes were delicious but nothing stood out. Seafood Sampler (Di Pesce): calamari red sauce was delicious, but otherwise just your standard seafood appetizer  Main Courses: Calzone: this guy is huge, but it's mostly filled with air and is actually smaller than those personal pizzas you get. Stagioni Pizza: Solid combination and a good filling pizza. Vermicelli: Pretty tasty pasta, honestly was one of their strengths. Veal Scaloppine: Its the dish that I ordered, but I felt that there were issues. The first was that there wasn't enough veal relative to the rest of the dish. The breaded part tasted too chewy and the veal tasted a tad harder than what I expected.  Di Manzo (22oz steak): Very rare and delicious but I keep in mind that it's fatty on one end, might be worth it if you can drop $50 Chicken: it looked aight, but nothing special that you couldn't get elsewhere. Salmon: this dish looked uninteresting, but I can't really say what it tastes like.  The food took around 20 minutes to get served. The bill surprisingly took longer. I'm not knocking the servers hard on that, I just want to have more frequent checks with the customers.  So it's a hit or miss depending on what you get. Reservations are required, but f you feel like you want to a company if around 10-20 people, try this place.",

    "text": "A nice Italian restaurant. The ambience is super cool, being in the middle of the Venetian, you actually get to eat out in the middle of the shopping center, with the ceilings painted like the sky and a nice view of the boats that go through the canal. However, it can get really loud.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer: nothing special, but not bad, the outside was crispy and the batter was well-seasoned. For dinner, we ordered two pastas: one was essentially a carbonara with a cream sauce, bacon, and chicken, and the other was a pasta with marinara and sausage. Although the pasta was homemade, it didn't have the nice al dente that you really want; I thought both pastas went overboard on the sauce, so the texture was kind of off, but the taste was all right. Again, I didn't think it was anything special.  Overall it's a good Vegas experience, to be out dining in the middle of the Venetian, but not an amazingly high-quality experience for the amount that you pay. Take your money elsewhere to any of the other great places, if you care about having a great dining experience, too.",

    "text": "Canaletto is located half \"outside\" in the square of the Venetian's Canal Shoppes and half \"inside\" the actual restaurant. We arrived as a 5-some with no reservation on a Saturday night at about 7:30 PM. This had been a slapped together plan after another dining option fell through with a newly-married couple, myself, my husband, and mother of the groom.  Luckily, they were able to seat us inside and we waited no less than 5 minutes. Ambiance of the restaurant is Italian, with masks on the walls and dim lighting. Our server was exceptionally nice, especially since many in our party had picky pallets.   Started with complimentary bread, olive oil and balsamic. Bread had a crusty exterior and soft interior. My husband also managed to grab the only roll served that had raisins in it. Next drinks; I ordered a Willamette Valley Riesling because I'm fairly certain I've had that varietal before and I enjoyed it, especially since it was the cheapest wine on the menu - still very good. Also, the have some decent beer options, as both the males at the table ordered and drank a few Blue Moons.  I was torn between the Bolognese Gnocchi and the Canelloni Chicken. I do love ordering gnocchi at nice Italian restaurants, but I asked the server which I should have and she said the Canelloni. Although the Canelloni was good, came with two sauces (cheese-based white and tomato-based red), I felt as though my meal was a bit disappointing compared to everyone's elses's at the table. Also, I thought the cheese sauce to be a bit bland, like it needed something, but the mushrooms on the dish helped, and the chicken was tender - a rotisserie-style, tender, and flavorful.  My husband ordered their special that night - a pasta with a lobster-bisque sauce, sea bass, salmon, shrimp, and clams, and mushrooms. I tried it, it was divine.  The server was also able to get a chicken alfredo dish made for someone at our table who was quite picky. Obviously an \"off menu\" item they basically just whipped together for our table. And lastly, our bride was suffering from an inability to select something off the menu as well. Instead our server asked us what type of meat she would like, she said lobster. So, they also, basically just made a pasta dish, plopped it into a fabulously cooked lobster and delivered it to the table. Honestly, it was a lovely sight to see and she said it tasted amazing.  Lastly we ordered some gelato all around. I got the strawberry with dark chocolate, which came with a nice, crunchy-sugary biscotti and had a tasty, but not over-powering strawberry taste. A light dessert, so a nice end to a heavy pasta meal.  Our server was a very nice woman, catering to our whimsical table and happy to take pictures of the bride and room and the party.  Only thing I could say is, they were definitely aware we were a wedding party, but really nothing special was done for the bride and groom. I thought perhaps a free dessert may have been in order, with a \"Congratulations\" written on the plate? I've seen that a lot in other restaurants, so I was surprised when nothing of the sort emerged in surprise-form for us.  None the less, it was a nice meal for us all, especially since the original plans fell through. Also, many props to the waitress for crafting some off-menu choices. Out of a lot of \"Italian\" places this one was certainly better than some I have been to in Vegas.",

Our waiter, Ignacio, remembered us from the first day and couldn't have been more attentive. You have to sit @ the bar or in the high top stools for the specials. We went to Otto (next door) previously and they offered no HH specials and the pizza was mediocre.",

I don't mind paying the price if you get payback with a great product. In this case you don't. The service was pretty good but the food when it arrived was less than adequate. The salad was not my taste, almost like they threw it together with what they had left over. In now my calf's liver was not bad, I've had better and worse so middle of the road would best describe it. Of course at these prices middle of the road is unacceptable. My wife ordered a bone in rib eye which she ordered medium well so she got it burnt like a charcoal briquette. The kicker it was tasteless. Really a total waste time of a meal. Not worth it.

I had the Murano room and it has actual balconies you can step out on to. My guests were definitely impressed!  So the amazing rooms are the only reason I chose this location or decided to take the time to write this review. I was looking to have my reception at the Venetian and every venue I spoke with was so strict- they said \"no\" to all of my special requests even though I was willing to pay extra. Working with Canaletto's coordinator, Natasha, was a blessing! She was so sweet! She worked with her managers and chefs to accommodate my requests and made the whole planning process so much easier- and less stressful- especially for someone planning their wedding from the other side of the U.S.! Day of, the reception went so smoothly! The service was wonderful and the food was exceptional. I received nothing but compliments from my guests- one of my friends is even considering having a Vegas wedding now just to have her reception at Canaletto!",

I found the chunks of potato to be a little strange, and the pesto ended up being a little oily for my taste. My friends ordered other pasta dishes, the best probably being the seafood linguine.

The bread selection with oil was quite tasty.  Ordered the rib-eye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Very juicy and melted in your mouth. It was plenty food for nearly two to share. Also had a glass of the 'blend 175' wine that went down nice and smooth with my meal.   Tried some pasta as well which was cooked nicely with mushrooms, pork, and bacon. YUM!

They have a very great selection of wine. The tiramisu was my favorite. They make it with real lady fingers.",

We never have reservations and just walk right in and always get a decent table, right on the promenade facing the action. This time we had live Italian Opera when we arrived! I ordered the braised beef short ribs and polenta. It was near to perfect (could have used more seasoning) but fell right off the bone - The polenta could have been creamier for this dish. The food is good enough but it's the ambiance that  takes the cake at this Venetian Hotel location.",

I'm from California and I forget that seafood isn't as fresh as I'm used to.  Silly me, I order their jumbo prawns with spaghetti in olive oil.  The shrimp was not as cooked as I would have liked but the pasta was decent.  My girlfriend had it worse.  Her mussels, clams and scallops were all undercooked and not fresh at all.  Eww.  We should have played it safe and gotten a ravioli dish.  In the end we didn't have to pay for my friend's bad dinner and didn't get sick from the poorly cooked seafood.  For being part of Il Fornaio I would have expected more since the one I've gone to locally serves the best fresh bread and entrees.  Oh well.  It's Vegas.  Looks classy but tastes a little dirty.

The menu looked inviting, and the location is beautiful.  We noticed several empty tables.  When I checked in with the hostess she said it would be a few minutes.  We waited 10 minutes, watching her argue with a co-worker.  An older gentleman walked over and seated our party of 4.  Once seated, we waited for 10 minutes and no one offered water or to take our order.  My husband and I feel if we aren't approached after 5-10 minutes, the restaurant isn't worth our time.  We did notice the people seated next to us were also upset;  they had bread & water, but told their waiter they had also been waiting for someone to take their order.  It is unfortunate this kind of service occurs in a busy resort like Venetian. We got up and walked out.",

    "text": "Never again, despite the nice atmosphere.  Maggiano's across from the Wynn (corner of Fashion Show Drive and Las Vegas Blvd) is nearby and MUCH MUCH BETTER IN EVERY WAY!  Canaletto was my choice for our Valentine's Day dinner. The setting in the faux Venetian square is very nice. We had a late lunch at their bar a few months before, and liked the lunch fare. However, the dinner experience was severely disappointing.  - HORRIBLE reservation service. We were running about 20 minutes late for our 4:30 PM reservation. I called the restaurant 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation and told them we were running about 20 minutes late. I was informed that our reservation would be canceled if we were 15 minutes late. Not a common practice, but it was Valentines Day, so fair enough. I imagined that they were overbooked and trying to squeeze everyone in. We rushed through getting out of the hotel (my lady still finishing up in the taxi). We rushed the taxi driver. We practically ran through the Palazzo. We got there exactly 15 minutes late. The place was EMPTY. Yes- we were RUSHED to get there by the restaurant only to find that we could have just walked up and gotten a table! Needless to say we were not happy, and not a great way to start the evening. IN ADDITION, during the entire 2 hours we were there the restaurant was never more than 50% full!   - \"OUT\" of Dessert. It's Valentines Day. What is one of the favorite treats on this day? Chocolate! For dessert we ordered the Dark Chocolate Mousse. 5 minutes later we were informed that they were \"out\". Keep in mind that this was at 6PM. The restaurant was 40% full and it was early in the evening. Simply NO excuse for this. There were no other chocolate desserts on the menu. We went to Godiva.   - Food was 2 stars. Nothing to write home about. The risotto was over salted. The salmon was over cooked and dry. The calamari was so rubbery and tasteless that it might as well have been tire tread. The rest of the meal was just OK. Definitely more Olive Garden than what you would expect.",

I've eaten twice at this establishment; the first time was \"okay\" -- complete with a manager bragging how they don't use nonfat milk for coffee drinks, never will, and finished off by saying \"I like to make my latte with half and half.\" Perhaps I should have learned.  Unfortunately for my party, we had a waiter that spent more time grinning at the two of us as he went by, came by exactly twice during the entire meal, and did just about anything possible to make us feel unwelcome.  This was in addition to busboys that were swearing about something right in front of us; this of course is when the staff wasn't busy watching the game on TV near the bar.  Where was the management?  In the back, around the corner, having social hour.  Which is my central point:  my big issue with many Vegas restaurants (The Venetian has this problem increasingly more often, from what I can see) is that they simply do well because of their location, and often for no other reason.  So your management experience (and dining experience) tends to vary -- a lot.  What I can say is that this place has declined since the last visit.  On the positive side, the bartender was descent.  Too bad the rest of the meal was ruined by fifth-class service and a staff that quite frankly was too tied up in talking to each other to care.",

When we checked in for dinner, the hostess did NOT walk us up to our room and neither did any of the other 2 hosts. Instead she directed us to walk down the hallway, turn left, and go up the stairs. That was such BAD service. How was I supposed to know which of the 4 dining rooms was for us? Luckily, I chose the right room. The room itself was very nice and had a view of the plaza below. You could enjoy being in a Disney-fied Italy.  However, things got better when our waiter arrived. He was friendly, helpful, and fun. He provided great choices for wine and made us feel welcome.   As for the food, it's not okay but not great. The bread is delicious, the pasta decent, the lamb and seafood cooked well. However, the espresso was strong and flavorful.

    "text": "Excellent place to have a wedding reception!!!  I've read other reviews that did not recommend Canaletto for a reception, however my experience there was superb!  I got married at the Venetian and then had my wedding reception at Canaletto.  We had a party of 50 and reserved a private room.  The ambiance was beautiful, with verandas facing the surreal skyline outside the restaurant.  The food and service was excellent.  We opted for a 2 hour open bar and the servers were on top of drink orders and refills.  It was great that guests didn't have to run to the bar each time they wanted a drink, instead they ordered and received it right at the table.  The menu options for a party of 50 included an array of options, from chicken, fish, steak, to even gluten free options.  All of my guests raved about the food and were impressed by the menu.  If your getting married at the hotel I highly recommend taking your wedding party there for lunch or dinner.  Thank you Canaletto management and staff for making my wedding so memorable!",

I had the chicken and my husband had the steak, we had no complaints at all, except about how stuffed we were afterward.  It was a very nice setting with the trio playing in St. Mark's Square, nothing like having dinner under the stars with live music in the background.",

The cheese was melt in your mouth, the only minus was having to ask for the Balsamic vinegar, but no big deal.  I had the special 4 cheese ravioli, in a mushroom cream sauce was nice, but nothing super.  My wife had the chicken and spinach with a spicy sauce which was the winner at our table.

Highly recommended, especially for a group party such as a reception. I've never thought of Vegas as affordable, but we had several courses, including lovely canapes and prosecco to start and a sorbet to cleans the palate (an interesting and complex dish with coffee and lemon flavors, not your usual scoop of frozen sugary fruit) for half the price per person as a NYC wedding reception menu would have been. The balcony is really nice, it makes you feel like you are really outdoors.",

The atmosphere of the \"patio\" area in the Grand Canal Shoppes is lovely, and the service is excellent from the moment you're greeted by the affable maitre d'. The menu selection is pretty broad, from apps and salads to pizzas, pastas, and fish and meat entrees. The portions are fairly large and the food is tasty. It's more like your neighborhood upscale Italian place than fine dining Italian, but there's nothing wrong with that.",

It sounds nice to eat overlooking the Venetian canal, but like the entire hotel, it's really quite bothersome hearing the voices of countless tourists echoing off the high ceilings.  The service is somewhat slow, and the quality of the food simply doesn't justify the price.  I have had better Italian food at Bucca di Beppo!   Gnocchi with Lamb Ragout--tastes like glorified Chef Boyardee Calamari--cold, and pretty rubbery Cod appetizer over polenta--too salty, uninspired, and somewhat bland Salad with pears, blue cheese, arugula & pomegranite dressing--couldn't taste the pomegranite, just tasted a little oily.  Pears were kinda mushy too. I have been to Il Forniao, and this is markedly worse. The restaurant next door--Il Postrio-- is yards better (granted, it's also more expensive).",

    "text": "Highly recommended.  I had lunch at Canaletto in the Venetian Grand Canal Shops.  I would definitely go there again.  It was good food at a modest price ($20).  If you want more detail, see below.  Food The SANT ERASMO Risotto (fresh shrimp, crab and baby artichoke) was excellent and a pretty good deal at $19.  There was lots of shrimp (12-15) and they sprinkled a good amount of crab on top.  The size of the serving was average - just enough to fill you up.  The risotto was cooked just right and it had a lot of flavor.  I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.  I'm from Los Angeles, but I've had a hard time finding good risotto.    I only had a bite of the RISOTTO FILANTE (Risotto of tomatoes, arugula, onions, garlic, Grana Padano and fresh mozzarella), but I preferred my risotto to it.  The Filante was tomato based and I preferred the more delicate Erasmo.  I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.  The Tiramisu was only ok.  It had a strong coffee taste, rather than a chocolate flavor.  That wasn't to my personal liking.  It was light and fluffy and the creme was very good.  I would give it a 5 out of 10 - just average.  I would probably skip it and try something else or go elsewhere for desert.    Scene The restaurant is located in the piazza area (Grand Canal shops) of the hotel.  Since I ate there during lunch, they have live performers (singers, lady imitating a statue) that do their routine about 50 feet away.  It's a pretty cool scene.    The waitress was attentive and friendly, but there weren't many people in the restaurant.  Overall - Highly recommended.  A good choice for the price range.",

It was, however, cool to have dinner under the fake sky surrounded by wandering people with gelato.  They also fit a large group of us at a table even though we had not all arrived.    The food here was actually really good, especially due to the fact that I'm not usually blown away by American Italian food.    I ordered the Pizza Cristina, which has prosciutto, arugula, parmesan, and white truffle oil.  It was large enough to split, but the best version of this pizza I've ever had.  We also started with the Bruschetta, which was standard, and the Melon di Prosciutto, which was delicious.  Definitely a must order.    Everyone else at my table had risotto and pasta and enjoyed their orders.  We also requested a birthday cake and it came out along with a canal street singer who serenaded my friend.  We were also pleasantly surprised by our waiter who was very friendly and wiling to chat with my friend in Italian for a good five minutes.  All in all, a great choice for dinner and a birthday.",

Being in the restaurant industry, inexperienced tools like him make me embarrassed to be a part of it.  If I walked around my restaurant like that, I'd be fired. And just a note to the \"chefs,\" sending out cold food for a $25 entree is inexcusable, but even worse is trying to heat it up by placing the whole eaten-off-of-already plate either in your oven or under the salamander, then sending it back out with out even replating it.

I also had SEPPIE NERE 22.59 Risotto with shrimp, scallops and fresh Mediterranean cuttlefish with natural black ink It doesn't look very pretty, but this dish is wonderful and one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Highly recommend both of these items.  The wait staff was very kind and helpful.  We sat in the fake \"outside\" area which was quite lovely.  The only annoying part was there were opera type singers close by in the open Venetian mall area that were extremely loud... so loud that we needed earplugs I kid you not!  We were so happy when they stopped. Also wanted to point out there is a happy hour that looked really good.  There is no mention of it on their website or anywhere... I would have gone to it if I had known since they have some food items half price I believe and drinks at a discount.  Will definitely go back to this restaurant every time I return to Vegas... just hope they fire the opera singers!   :)",

Apart from that, the food was quite delicious, but the service and overall experience was not worth the price tag. For one, the host led us straight through the restaurant, to the back empty room, and wanted us to sit at the table in the far corner by the elevator; we asked to be seated at the table next to it instead. Later on, we saw him attempt to seat another group at the same neglected corner table and they, too, requested a different one. Secondly, the servers did not clean the edges and rims of the plates, so the presentation of the food was lacking. The best service was from the host who, although not very attentive to our group since we were the only party in the back room, talked very well and sounded very hospitable, trying hard to evoke an authentic Italian restaurant feel.",

The pasta was mushy from not cooking with a large pot of boiling water.   My buddy had a steak which came out tough and even though he asked for medium well, it came out pretty well done.  Dessert of apple icecream with cinnamon apple crepe was not interesting. apple ice cream tasted artificial and crepe was thick and soggy.  Las Vegas has good food, but this place does not",

He was an old man who kept on talking to us (all young girls dolled up for the fancy evening) instead of taking our orders.  Finally he took our orders and kind of gave us a look like, \"that's all you're going to order??\"   Anyway, the food was good.  I don't know about the bread that came with our meals though.

Great pastas and pizzas, it's super nice to sit \"outside\" on the square and enjoy your food.  We had the gnocchi, pizza with truffle oil, and the seafood pasta.  All of which were above average.  Pizza was nice and thin, which is exactly how I like it.  The gnocchi was unreal, fluffiest and softest gnocchi I think I've ever had.  Didn't pay much attention to the quality of the wine/drink list, but it seemed adequate for the type of restaurant it was.    The service was great, waiter was very friendly.  Although it should be noted that both me and my wife could've sworn he was on some kind of drugs, he still did a great job!  Dress code seemed to be Vegas casual, which is pretty much whatever you want.  We brought our son here (1.5 yr old) and they were both very nice and accommodating to us, so if you are here with kids (which I don't know why we or anyone would want to be) this place is great for that.",

This isn't my first time here because unfortunately my mother really likes the view of Mark's Square and the cleanliness of the restaurant. However, I must say, my experiences here have never been good which has compelled me to finally write this review.   This time around, I was not only reminded that everything is over-priced but just overall the food is NOT good! I was so disappointed and cringing with displeasure by the time our bill came.   First thing that irked me was the waitress at the register directing guests to tables. She looked like the HBIC and acted like one too. I came around 2pm to see if I could make a reservation for 5:30-6. She said she wasn't taking any reservations but that if we were to walk in around that time, she'd be happy to seat us. however, that all sounds dandy and great when you're just reading it without the tone of voice she was saying it in. She was the most snarky and easily annoyed person I had ever met. Didn't make any eye-contact with me, had her head bent down, hurriedly dealt with me and asked for the next guest in line. What type of quality service, or lack thereof, was that?   Unfortunately, we did come back for a meal a couple hours later and I will regret the decision forever. We ordered the proscuitto pizza, the pear and gorgonzola salad, I tried the salmon, and we felt like we needed some type of appetizer to tie the meal together. My waitress had then recommended the caprese salad. We read the description, saw what we were getting and agreed to try it. When the salad came out, it was literally THREE PIECES OF TOMATO the size of two quarters each, with a blob of mozzarella over it. Are you kidding me? The tomatoes weren't even Roma tomatoes, and for $11.99, it was not worth it.   As for the pizza, I was also really disappointed in the taste. It tastes and looks like proscuitto and cheese was dumped onto a warm piece of flatbread. I understand you may not normally bake the proscuitto with the pizza, but this pizza was just not done well. The flavor profile was also very bitter and I hated it.   As for the salmon, it was meh. Not bad but not crazy good. I have no complaints about it but also not rushing to order it again.   Overall, I would not recommend this establishment to anyone and if anything, please go try Traittoria Reggiano. It's a small, hole in the wall, and doesn't have the view as this place where you get to enjoy the performances in the plaza, but the flavors are there and worth the bang for your buck! Even chains like BRIO or Maggiano is better than this place!",

As we left to try to find another place to eat we passed a multitude of establishments (in the Venetian) that were business as usual!! We realized they likely just didn't want to serve us. TOTAL DISASTER. Would not recommend.",

However, this time I had lunch...and it wasn't that great.   The ambience is wonderful no matter what time you go though and I highly suggest sitting on the patio so you can people watch. I realize people watching in Vegas is amazing no matter what but wedding parties frequent this area as some actually get married riding the gondolas in the Canal. There are also singers and mimes in the Piazza that are fun to watch.   I assumed they would have a different menu for lunch or even a brunch menu...but no, same menu all day. They only have heavy meats and pastas so I couldn't find anything I really wanted. Plus my girlfriend ate a huge pasta dish and had to take a nap afterwards! Lunches that make you want to nap are not good in Vegas!!",

Wait and bar staff looks at us sit down, makes no attempt to come to our table. 10-15 minutes later i motion to one of them requesting service, finally soneone comes over. Place is not busy. Balance of service is slow, cold, poor attitude from guy with tatoos all over his arms. Food is not good at happy hour, limited, odd choices, margherita pizza is terrible, and small. We left unhappy, staff could care less. Do yourself a favor and skip eating here, and try  Zefferinos for good Italian food, in the Grand Canal Shops, and much better happy hour.",

    "text": "This place deserves better reviews than people are giving it.  I guess it comes down to experience - some people have servers or cooks on bad days - but for me and my girlfriend, we have nothing bad to say.  This was her first trip to Vegas.  I'd been a few times, but we wanted her trip to be perfect, so we did a lot of research and planned it all.  Its really difficult to avoid Italian food in Vegas, and we both love Italian, so we knew one night would probably end up with Italian.  We chose Canaletto because in the end, it was better reviewed, had \"patio\" dining (though obviously, its inside the shops at Venetian, so its not exactly outdoors), and had a menu that had multiple options for both of us.  First, to anyone who hasn't been to Vegas before and thinks eating inside a mall is a bit tacky - these are malls in Vegas.  The shops at Venetian are set up to look like streets in Venice - there's even a river that runs through it and you can take gondola rides.  It is gorgeous.  Moreover, they had live music in the square, so even though there were a lot of people walking around, it was easy to ignore them because of the beautiful architecture, the music, and of course, my gorgeous girlfriend.  My point is that even though you're inside the shops, it was still romantic and beautiful.  If you look at the pictures, you will also see the inside of the restaurant is also very classy and pretty.  Service was excellent.  Our server was attentive, brought us extra bread when we wanted it, had our water glasses filled, and timed the meal perfectly.  Food was delicious.  I got Tagliatelle Alla Castellana - pasta ribbons with pork, bacon, mushrooms and a brandy cream sauce.  My girlfriend got something called Barilotti, but I can't find it on their menu now and I don't recall what it was.  She's a vegetarian though, and loved it.  Me, obviously not a vegetarian, and loved mine, too.  Both had a glass of a special Pinot Grigio they had, which we both enjoyed, too.  Needless to say, we were very happy.  Canaletto is an upscale, but casual, delicious Italian restaurant that is moderately priced.  You can go there dressy or casual.  All in all, a terrific restaurant.",

Ten years ago the food was authentic and beautifully presented, but the other night the best praise I can muster would be \"passable.\" None of the five in our party felt that they had anything special.   Canaletto, with its \"outdoor\" seating in the Venetian's version of Saint Mark's Square, is still a nice enough place for an American, albeit uninspired take on Italian food. But with so many better food choices in Vegas I can recommend it no longer.",

We split the Seafood Sampler, which came with four small portions (2 shrimp, 4 pieces of calamari, 1-2 slides of carpaccio, etc.) - each of us had a couple of bites.   My friends ordered pasta, with portion sizes ranging from small to moderate. I had the calf's liver with two slices of polenta. With an ordinary sauce, it was forgettable. Perhaps the pizza would have been better. With a couple of beers my check came to about $40 which was reasonable.   Overall, I left with a feeling that this was a typical Vegas experience - ok food but nothing memorable.",

At 7pm the lights get turned into night mode and it is suddenly very scary, wait, very romantic in there.  It takes on a whole new look and feel and its a great one.   Service - Booked reservation for 6, needed to push to 6:30, and was assisted both promptly and friendly.  Arrived at the restaurant and was seated immediately. Our server came over and greeted us and began the dinner service.  I wish I could remember her name because she was amazing.  When I ordered the quid ink risotto, she advised that it was her favorite and I just love when people add personal touches.   Food - It's Canaletto and its amazing.  I tried to hard not to devour my food, but I was uncontrollable.  Every time I finished one bite, I wanted to eat it again.  This was an epic battle, and I lost... and I won... :)     Overall - I rate it 5 stars because it is amazing.  Definitely hit it up when you are in Las Vegas.   You will enjoy it.",

To give some context, I had kind of a shitty slog of a day conventioning, and all I was looking forward to was dinner at Yardbird with the Mister. Well, I'm a goddamn moron and made the reso for the wrong day and Yardbird had no room. We were both starving and hangry and picked Canaletto because it had no wait.   Enter Carl - he made it his personal mission to give us a great night. My wine glass was never empty and he was funny and engaging - definitely turned our frowns upside down!   On the food front, we started with Polpetti two ways - one with truffled mushrooms, the other with tomato sauce. Both options were delicious and the meatballs were actually very light in texture, just like you'd get in Italy. The Mister opted for homemade gnocchi with yet more meatballs - very hearty, and very tasty too. My risotto antica (chicken, asparagus) was pretty boring - it lacked flavor but the rice was nicely cooked.   Prices, for the Venetian, are pretty reasonable for a sit down place and you're right in the St Marks Square, so you'll likely see a performer or two. I'd go back.",

    "text": "Going to Canaletto was the best meal decision I made while in Vegas. Really nice place with the right view or the surrounding shops. The table bread was nice and warm. I ate way too much of it. We ordered a pizza as an app for the table and everyone gobbled it down. Octopus was really good as well. But my main dish was EVERYTHING. Pasta cooked perfectly. My intent was only to eat half of the pasta but the next thing I knew I had already eaten more than 3/4 of it and polished off the rest with ease. The shrimps were so large I though I had a baby lobster on my plate. The sauce was seasoned to PERFECTION. The sauce was so good I found myself cleaning the plate with the bread. I am going to leave this photo right right so you can see for yourself. Worth every dollar and calorie",

Whatever you do, avoid Trattoria Reggiano Italian Cuisine.  We tried this the next night and we were disappointed (also in the Venetian).",

We then ask the server for recommendations for entrees, she suggested Cannelloni Di Pollo, pasta tubes filled with chicken and Pasticcio Alla Gradese, a seafood lasagna. Both items are baked and was good. I like seafood and my entree had a nice assortment of crab, shrimp, and shellfish. The chicken was good as well. Also, nice portions to share. Service was decent.

I try to sit on the higher tables next to the bar and watch the show in the square and people walk by. It's always lively. A very pleasant way to eat and stay out of the heat in Las Vegas.

I have tried most of the menu in the past, my favorite is the veal ouso bucco everything else is borderline chain restaurant quality....however if you get a table in the outdoor veranda you will likely not even know the food is just ok because the obeisance is terrific.

Another ordered a personal pizza which was very large and a great dish to share. I enjoyed the Petto Di Pollo Al Peperoncino which had some kick to it which was pleasantly surprising. The chicken was tenderized and flattened out with a nice grill crust. Also served with some garlic spinach on the side.

Then we just wanted to order just the Prosciutto e Melone and some champagne and enjoy the atmosphere, which made our waitress nervous, but she took our dinner order after we finished our appetizer.  Anyhow, sitting outside is perhaps your best bet at this restaurant. It's like sitting in a very fake St. Marks Square with no pigeons and no Italians. However, the trick in the illusion is to drink several glasses of vino and suddenly Venice is everywhere!  I ordered the Gnocchi which was delicious and my friend has some mushroom ravoli cream sauce special which was also damn good.  But the best part of our meal was the SGROPPINO. At this point in the meal, I was drunk as F**K and couldn't bear the thought of another drink. But once this dessert hit my lips, I literally yelped \"OMG.\"  It's lemon sorbet with vodka, champagne and a tiny bit of finely ground espresso on the top. I could just drink five of them in a row and call it dinner.  If only I could be in Venezia for reals.",

We were directed to a nice table by the window that overlooked the Gondola rides and the Italian singers.  The setting at Canaletto is casual/formal and ambiance was quite nice. I really liked our waiter because it he was this very jolly and talkative Italian man. He was very quick about bringing us bread and drinks because we were famished. Also, there was only a short wait because our entrees all arrived. Our waiter kept us company throughout dinner and wanted to share a story with us. I don't know whether to be amused or annoyed that he was basically telling a story about how asians lower the costs/prices of everything so that other countries cannot compete in the global market. But anyways, it made for an interesting dinner conversation.   Our entrees were surprising tasteful. I found the menu somewhat hard to navigate through because everything was Italian. They had a wide selection of wines imported from Italy, France and California. Then again, it should be expected since it's Vegas.   Most of us ordered pasta dishes. A couple of dishes that stood out were: -Linguine alla Buranella: thin flat pasta with mussels, prawns, scallops and clams seasoned with tomatoes, crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine. It smelled delicious and reminded me of pasta cooked in a bouillabaisse  -Cannelloni di Pollo: large pasta tubes filled with rotisserie chicken, mushrooms, organic spinach, sundried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella; bechamel and tomato sauces. The cannelloni was baked in a cast iron dish so it was piping hot when served. My friend said this was rich, delicious and worth ordering.  -Zuppa Di Pesce Alla Chioggiotta. I really like the name because when spoken properly, it sounds really cool. Essentially, it is an italian version of bouillabaisse--seafood stew with scampi, prawns, scallops, clams, mussels and fresh fish fillet. Grilled garlic ciabatta bread comes with it. I thought that this was cooked perfectly--seafood was tender and sweet and the aromatic smell the white wine was just divine. I could have used more bread to soak up the juices.   Overall, dinner at Canaletto was an enjoyable experience. It is a little more expensive than other restaurants for each entree was at least $20. The quality of the meal was one of the better ones I've had at Las Vegas. So if you're ever staying in the Venetian and looking for a place to eat, check it out. My only regret was that our group was too full to order desserts. So if go, save room!  Buon appetito!",

My suggestion, spend a little more and get quality food.  Try one of the other places that are higher ranked on yelp.",

The setting is nice, in the middle of the Venetian rotunda.  The service was ok, the food itself was so-so.  Mixed results at the table.  I had a risotto which was just ok, a co-worker of mine had a seafood dish which he enjoyed, another had the osso bucco and thought it was terrible. Another co-worker had a very dull looking margherita pizza.  My wife had a very ordinary salad with a very ordinary minestrone. With so many other options in the immediate area, this is one you can skip with no hesitation.  For extremely mediocre Italian food, this is your choice.",

    "text": "If there was a closer experience to a beautiful dinner in Venice, I would need my passport.  Between the seemingly real sky overhead with a permanent perfect light and clouds (you will notice as you walk, in your peripheral it appears the clouds move) to the ambiance of sitting on the patio and people watching while sipping liquid amazement in the form of a smooth chianti, you could almost think you were really far far away from the hustle and bustle of Vegas.    The waiters are ninja like in bringing and taking away plates without being obtrusive. It's very easy to close out the people walking by if you want and just enjoy the chef's work.  I had a beautiful chicken dish, spicy and delicious with salted steamed spinach, not usually a fan but it was a perfect palate cleanser.  My.husband had a pasta dish and we both enjoyed desserts as well.  Their gelato is nearly the best I've ever had. Yummy.   We never felt rushed or crowded, our waiter vanished into air when not needed and left us to enjoy our evening. Only wish we had ordered another bottle of wine and stayed awhile.  Only conplaint and it's no fault of the restaurant, it's Vegas and while you eat and people watch, you become a tourist attraction too. Easily avoided by sitting inside amidst the dark wood and low lighting . Romantic no?",

The herbs on top (well one), was a nice crisp addition. Shrimp, was delicious!  Sauce wasn't bad  Cons: Mussels and clams tasted bad, not fresh, it was a very bad taste.  Neutral/Mixed-feelings: The linguine was on the harder side, but I guess it was good.  Aside from the use of tomatoes and I did like the herbs, my boyfriend makes better pasta.. And it was pricey..   The drink wasn't bad, neutral on it, it's sweeter than a bellini for sure. (peach &  prosecco)  *The bread in the beginning is delicious! My whole table liked their food except for the one who ordered pizza, but what do you expect. We practically finished our dishes (party of 8)  The lady at the front said they don't do reservations, but they did for us anyways.  Waiter was nice, friendly, seemed to know things or remember other people's suggestions if not knowing. Theres a port wine that many seemed to love (the bartender recommended it). They don't have sweet white wines.  She spilt the check for all of us, so that was nice.",

    "text": "After just having such an excellent and wonderful experience with both food and service at the Canaletto in Newport Beach, I was utterly disappointed in this LV location.  I had the most condescending and rude server....ever!!  If it wasn't a business dinner, I would of complained about him right there and then. Better yet, I would of said something to his face. I mean who...WHO would actually say, \"What do you mean by bland?\" Which was said with the most sarcastic tone and look on his face. I mean do I have to really explain what bland means to a server??!!  He works for a restaurant, for goodness sake. Did I really need to pull out my phone and Google the word for him? Bland means no taste, needs more seasoning, taste like nothing...no flavor! But really, how about taking it as a cue that I didn't like it. Perhaps even ask me if I wanted something else in replace of that? Any \"nice, sit down\" restaurant would do that. Even Applebee's would do that. But instead, he had the nerve to ask one of the other business associates, who had ordered the exact same thing, and sat all the way across the table, if his was also bland. What the??! But I shouldn't feel so special. He had that condensing tone with a few others, even right as we sat down. I won't go into every detail or else this would be an essay. He even threw in some inappropriate comments. It was just so awkward for him to be standing over me that I didn't want to make a scene and just said never mind and continued to eat this undesirable dish. Believe me, it was hard. More so, if you know me..it was really, really hard not to say anything. This guy was just a complete joke and definitely should not be working in the hospitality industry. Even Applebee's servers wouldn't dare speak to their patrons like that. Everyone was trying to keep their professionalism throughout the night as we were all looking at each other dumbfounded by this guy's actions.  Fortunately, one of the other associates I was sitting next to, took it upon himself to inform the restaurant as we were wrapping up for the night. Supposedly, they took my meal off the bill and two others that had issues with theirs as well. But really, what was that going to do for us at that time. My meal was being taken cared of by the company and that wasn't the point. I would of appreciated an apology from the server or management. But no one came to the table to do so. I guess that goes to show you that the restaurant as a whole does not apply the same patronage or customer service values that this so called fine dining chain does at the Newport Beach location.  BTW, the server's name is Josh. Yup, if you're reading this, Applebee's would of chewed you up and spit you out for this. You're a douche for all those comments and a horrible server. Just plan bad.",

    "text": "It was my mom's birthday and she wanted to do the buffet at Caesars but even at 8pm the line was still 90+ minutes.  Bellagio and Wynn also had 60+ minute waits too.  My genius dad proposed dinner at St Mark's Square at Venetian since they enjoyed walking around there the other day.  I made a reservation for both here and Postrio on the way and she chose Canaletto after looking at both menus.  Even though you're in a mall, it's not just any mall that offers surroundings like this.  The dim evening lighting of the square, the music and atmosphere gives you a really decent simulation of Piazza San Marco although my parents said it's much busier here than the actual one.  Having no pigeons around is nice too :P  Most locals would probably consider Canaletto a total tourist trap but I thought it was a lot of fun.  How have I not taken any of our out of town friends or family here before?  Our server was terrific.  He was super friendly, had great knowledge of the menu and made our experience better than I expected.  Appetizers:  We started with the \"Bruschetta Caldo\".  I liked that the bread was grilled and you could tell the tomatoes were really fresh.   We also had the \"Calamaretti Fritti\" or fried calamari.  It came with surprisingly few tentacles (much to the happiness of some at the table) and the tartar sauce was a big hit compared to the marinara.  The \"Insalata Canaletto\" was pretty basic with greens, cheese, oil and large croutons.  Entrees:  I got the \"Tagliatelle alla Castellana\" which was comprised of \"pasta ribbons tossed with pork tenderloin, bacon, shiitake mushrooms, Grana Padano and thyme in brandy-cream sauce\".  It was rich and flavorful.  I could only finish half since we loaded up on bread in the beginning but it was really good and the pasta tasted homemade.    My mom got the \"Maiale Kurobuta Ripieno\".  That was an \"herb-stuffed center-cut Kurobuta pork chop wrapped in pancetta, topped with kalamata olives and capers; served with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes and sauteed organic spinach\".  This was a MONSTER cut of pork that was really delicious.  I would've gnawed on the bone had I not stuffed myself to be honest.   On a side note, the servers probably go insane with all the customers butchering the names of these dishes!  Try saying \"Petto Di Pollo Al Pepperoncino\" 5 times!  Or even better yet, \"FILETTO DI BRANZINO AL PROSECCO E ZAFFERANO\"?!?!  How do they avoid laughing?  My wife really liked her veal scaloppine or as the Italians would say \"SCALOPPINE CON FUNGHI E SPECK\".  They were 4 pieces of delicious, boneless pieces with great sauce, portobello mushrooms and some really good grilled polenta.    My dad got the house special that night which was a linguine dish with seafood.  I didn't even try his since I was so stuffed with my own but he said he liked it a lot.    Dessert:  Our waiter surprised my mom and brought out a tiramisu with a candle.  It actually ended up being a really great evening despite our initial plans going awry!!  I will certainly take more visitors here.        This spellcheck should take about a decade.....",

    "text": "Ended up here by mistake. My wife had eaten at the Mexican place at the Venetian the day before and told me how good it was. Not being able to remember the name, just knowing it started with \"Can..\" something, as soon as I saw this and thought \"That's it!\"   As we were walking up, I thought it seemed weird for a Mexican restaurant, but maybe they were trying to mix in the Venetian theme or something. Once I looked at the menu, my suspicions were confirmed. I was in the wrong place. Oh well, let's eat some Italian food.  Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of Italian, so I had to spend al lot of time looking at the menu over stuff that seemed overly fancy and not too appealing to me. Finally I gave in, represented Parks n Rec and ordered the... Calzone.  It was probably the second time in my life I've had a calzone, but it was pretty decent. I it was also massive. If you're looking for a huge serving, this fits.  Overall it wasn't bad, but for me, it just wasn't worth it. I can't recall what my friend ordered, but I know he got a side salad with it, which upon receiving the bill, we discovered was $10.99. That's crazy. If they ask you if you would like a side salad with your order, be aware that it's $11 on top of your already fairly expensive meal.  I didn't hate it, but I definitely won't be back.",

I ordered a Caesar salad in which the salad maker was heavy handed when he drizzled the dressing on the romain hearts that had one anchovy on top as a garnish. Main entree consisted of linguine noodle with meat ragu sauce. Portion was ample but nothing special. Had the Tiramisu which was not presented in the traditional  sense  as one would expect.  Overall: Prior to writing this review, I learned that this is part of the Il Fornaio chain of restaurants. Had I known this, I probably would not have chosen this place",

We ordered a salmon with potatoes and green beans and angel hair pasta with shrimp and alfredo sauce; not too heavy but the perfect balance between sauce and garlic. It was absolutely hearty and hits the spot just right.

    "text": "I wanted to love this place but came away a bit disappointed. Patrons are paying for the view and ambiance here. Not the best italian food. We purchased a Travelzoo voucher $75 for two appetizers, two entrees and a shared dessert. Even with the great deal on the voucher, the overall experience was lacking. The best I can describe our restaurant experience is - inconsistent.  Waitress was pleasant  and well informed on the menu (+) but then brought out dessert menu before the dinner was completed. She asked  if I wanted a second glass of wine when I still had half of the first glass remaining. It made us feel rushed. Like - get in and get out so we can get more customers in here. On to the food. Again, inconsistent. Appetizers: the meatballs were not good, over salted and just so, so. I would bet they were not even made in-house. Whereas the fried calamari was delicious with a tartar type sauce and marinara provided.  Entrees: inconsistent. The seafood linguine was terrific. Nice, light red marina, with wine sauce and good portion of various seafood. Yet, the pasta with the beef ragu sauce was so bad it was almost inedible. It was like dried, days-old, ground beef and almost no sauce. I only ate a couple of bites of it. Yuck! How can you mess up beef ragu sauce for goodness sake? That is pretty basic italian. Dessert: good. We ordered the chocolate cake with sea salt caramel gelato. The gelato was the star here. The cake was tasty yet served cold.  I would have expected it to be served warm or even room temp.  Now, here is the part that upset my husband the most. Here we are in this lovely restaurant. Waitress asks for voucher. I show her the voucher and barcode on my phone. She has to send the manager over to scan the code (All good so far). After he scans it, he tells me needs a pin number for the voucher. I've never needed a pin code for a voucher. I politely responded that I needed a moment to find it in my Travelzoo app and asked for a moment to locate it (hint, hint *  please give me a moment and step away). He stands there, right at the table, with his mini flashlight shining on my phone for 2-3 minutes, while I am trying to find it in the app. My husband was appalled. We felt they are going for a classy feel but lacked etiquette. Overall, this place was inconsistent. I would only return for drinks and dessert but not a meal. We enjoyed Yardbird (Southern food) inside Venetian much more as the food and service were superb.",

Pros - great location, friendly host staff, cocktail was well made  Cons - we weren't sure if we were going to eat yet, so we ordered drinks and told the server (Mario) that we weren't sure about food, he complained that they should have seated us at the bar and what does the host staff know, then he made a rude comment about charging us for the bread (we didn't have any and didn't care).... I told him I'd be happy to pay for anything and he rudely walked off.   The funny thing is I \"was\" going to tip at least 20 bucks on a 28 dollar tab bc I used to be a waiter back in college and know it sucks when someone takes your table up for a cheap meal (instead I tipped 6)... and ironically, later, when we got hungry we just decided we didn't want our meal ruined by the rude server and went to Scarpetta for Italian (which was awesome!)....   As a wholesaler for a financial services company, this Vegas trip I probably spent close to 7k taking clients out for drinks and meals, and next year I'll spend more... But I'll never spend another dollar here.",

It was a bit disheveled due to a party in front of us but nothing crazy. The waiter we had started off nice until I told him I was sharing a meal. He immediately said I was not aloud to do that. I told him then that my spouse was not eating. I had a gastric bypass six years ago and do not eat much. I enjoy food just smaller portions. From that point on he seemed to not give much notice to our table. When I asked him about the desert that came with my meal and if it contained alcohol he said no. I asked him a couple of times because I have an allergy. Part of why I ordered the pre fix meal was that it had this available. After I was through he told me that they do put alcohol in the desert. I told him I would not have ordered that if I knew.  They salad was not good the pizza was soggy and the service was sub par. Not to mention the noise from the performance was very loud. This picture is the pizza crust not the cheese. He then said my credit card did not work which I felt was to embarrass me. I told him there was nothing wrong with my card. He reran it and it went through. He stated the manager got it to work. Horrible experience.",

The ambiance is actually quite nice as you sit beneath the False blue sky of 'venice' and there's the dull roar of chatter and people in conversation - all of those things I felt were fine. However the food definitely left something to be desired.  Portions were just fine, no complaints there.  Price was a bit on the high end, but that's to be expected with any restaurant in / near the convention center.  However the big reason I'm giving just 3 stars is the food wasn't all that great and I don't know if I'd go back for a second round. I ordered a shrimp risotto dish that tasted fine, but the crab on top of the dish tasted a bit older and not the greatest. The risotto itself was fine, no worries there, but the freshness of the seafood in the seafood risotto left something to be desired. Spent about $30 here on the main dish.  Probably not a repeater, although convenient if you're in a hurry in 'Venice'",

I then had some of the Calamari and it was standard fare,but still pretty good.  My favorite was the Vermicelli Al Pomodoro, which I substituted homemade Tagliatelle noodles and included a pic.  Very very good.. only negative is that my hotel room didn't have a fridge as I would have loved to have eaten the whole thing!    Dessert was the Soffiato Al Cioccolato.  Yum!

If you choose to dine out on the patio, you get to enjoy the ambiance with the blue skies, beautiful Italian architecture, and occasional performances on the stage nearby!  When you first sit down, the waiter will pour some oil and vinegar on a plate for you that you can dip their complimentary bread in. There are three different kinds of bread and they were all delicious and came out nice and hot.  If you choose to order a pizza, don't plan to eat it all by yourself! It's huge and shareable among maybe 3 people. I came as a party of three and we ordered a pizza, and a pasta and were unbelievably full, we didn't even get to finish their delicious bread!  The food is amazing. The Christina ($25.95) is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It's a thin crust pizza with mushrooms, prosciutto, arugula, and a hearty amount of cheese. Mmm. Not a bad price for such a big and high-quality pizza!  The pasta was also delicious. Tomato sauce was just enough and very tasty! Some high quality stuff right there!",

It's located in the \"St. Marks\" area of the Venetian's food court. Not on the water, but you can sit beneath the \"sky\" with the illusion of being outside which is nice!  They served us with bread (some of which was warm) plus olive oil and balsamic as a starter, which was a nice touch.   We ordered fried asparagus as a side, bruschetta, pesto and burrata pizza, the gnocchi with formaggio, and the eggplant risotto. Everything was actually pretty solid and quite delicious, and the gnocchi was the favorite. The risotto could've been better, but the crispy eggplant kicked it up a notch. Everything could've been slightly more flavorful, but I thought it was overall a satisfying meal!",

Service sucked.  No one smiles.  No one is friendly.  Everyone seems to hate their job (especially the hostess).  Waiter literally stands on the side, watching you eat, while doing nothing.  Because there is literally nothing for him to do (no customers).  There were hardly any choices for pasta.  Almost everything was tomato or cream sauce.  I really do like pasta, but none of their sauces had any interesting flavor profiles like mushroom or spice or anything at all.  We ordered the tagliatte with cream sauce which was ok.  The pesto gnocchi, which was horrible.  And the seafood pasta in tomato sauce, which I could have made from a can.  Biggest waste of $180 ever.  So sad.  Yes, their pasta is fresh, but their sauces don't make up for it.",

You can also see the performers in the square. The scenery is beautiful with what almost looks like the outdoor sky above. You will feel like you are sitting in Italy.  We had the three course lunch special. You had your choice of a salad/appetizer, main course, and dessert. I had the caprese salad. It was larger than I expected and delicious. For my meal I had the cannelloni. It was a decent size and very filling. For my dessert I had to go with the tiramisu. It was perfection.  The waitstaff was super friendly. My uncle, who is blind, needed help getting to the bathroom which was on the second floor. The staff guided us to an elevator and held the door open.  We will definitely be back when we have guests in town or for date night.",

When I told him there were some \"meh\" reviews about it on here he was like, \"wtf??\"  Anyway, first of all the service was great.  I don't know the name of the waiter but we had him both times we were there.  We asked his suggestion for a dry white wine and he brought out this killer Sicilian wine that blew our socks off. When we went back the second time a few months later, we were excited to have that wine again but they didn't have it so he brought us another one he thought we'd like and sure enough, it was even better than the first.  Even though the place was jam packed and we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, we didn't have to wait long for a table on the piazza.  We had a drink at the bar while we waited for about 10 minutes.  Both times we had the pear salad with arugula, blue cheese, grapes, and pomegranate dressing.  So. Good.  We had the Caprese salad as an appetizer.  It was good but I was a little disappointed they didn't use buffalo mozzarella.  A real Italian restaurant should always use buffalo mozzarella!  So that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  Both times I was there I had the giant prawns alla Busara with spaghetti.  The dish was so good that I had to order it again.  The flavor in that sauce is truly awesome.  It had the kind of flavor that I've really only had in pasta dishes in Italy.  American pasta dishes are usually bland.  They used just the right balance of all the spices and flavors.  My fiance ordered the seafood pasta that was on special that night and enjoyed it very much.  I didn't try it so can't comment. On our first visit he had the canneloni stuffed with chicken and we both thought it was very good.  The sauce was really flavorful.  We plan to go back every time we're in Vegas.  Next time I'm going to have to try the pizza because you can't judge an Italian restaurant fully without trying the pizza.  The pizzas we saw on other tables looked delicious, though.",

For our reception, we had a cocktail hour in the upstairs lounge and reserved the Murano room for our dinner for about 35 guests.  Everything was outstanding!  During the cocktail hour, we had hors d'oeuvres served to all of our guests. Everything was delicious and nothing was leftover! For dinner there were 4 choices for our guests. The steak was cooked to order. My husband ordered the steak rare and it was perfect! I ordered the chicken and it was amazing - it was basically half of a roast chicken - juicy and delicious! Other people I talked to who ordered the salmon and the pasta dishes thought they were delicious.  Aside from the food, the view from the room was wonderful - we could look out from the second floor to see the entire St Mark's indoor square at the Venetian. And I couldn't be more happy with the staff. They were attentive to all of our needs. We picked out special wines to serve with dinner and we made a last minute change to open the cocktail hour to a full bar as opposed to wine and beer only.  The manager and servers checked in with us throughout the event to make sure we were happy with everything.  Having our reception here was stress-free and we are extremely happy with the entire experience. I highly recommend Canaletto!!",

When my family and I got there, we were treated poorly by the seater.  We had requested an OPEN table next to the street for a better experience. She curtly told us that it was saved for someone at that exact moment and that we would have to sit at very poor seats or wait 20 minutes... for an OPEN table. Then, when we asked for the manager, she snipes, \"Me and him are both the same so you don't have to talk to him.\"    Then when we finally got the table, it takes 10 more minutes to get a waiter. Of course, once the manager noticed us, everything was peachy. It should not have taken us 30+ minutes to even get water to drink for a restaurant that tries to be high class.",

    "text": "My parents and myself came across Canaletto while walking through the Grand Canal shopping area in the Venetian. It's very authentic Italian feel caused us to make reservations for that same night, on Christmas actually. We wanted Italian food that night and were pleased to find this restaurant. We ate in the actual inside part of the restaurant which we prefered so it was less noisy and laid back. The service was very great. Our waiter was Italian and very pleasent and  helpful. It's a very simple ambiance but it makes your Italian experience all that more authentic like. It's actually a nice place to go  if you want to get away from all the glitz and glam of the Las Vegas strip and into a more comforting home like atmosphere. I was craving chicken so I ordered the pollo allo spiedo as my entree which was hormone-free chicken roasted on the rotisserie served with roasted fingerling potatoes and sauteed vegetables. But instead of the roasted fingerling potatoes I asked for polenta(I love polenta). The polenta came in two triangular cakes, very good although I do prefer when they are served as more of a mashed potato consistancy. The roasted chicken was my favorite because it was perfectly moist, tender, and filled with delicious favors. It was a generous portion so I couldn't even finish it all. I'd definitely go back to try other dishes on the menu like one of the many risotto dishes listed. My dad had one with seafood which he raved about afterwards and I believe my mom had veal. I tried hers eventhough I was reluctant to, but it was actually very good. But I'm telling you, if you like roasted chicken you won't be sorry with that choice! Great Italian restaurant :-]",

    "text": "I have to admit that when it comes to fine dining, I'm a straight up snob. But hey, if I know I'm going to be paying an arm and a leg for anorexic portions of so-called \"exquisite\" food, my entire experience better be damn worth it!  How am I a snob? Well, you know when you walk into a restaurant and you just look around and it's not only visually appealing but almost calls to your senses saying \"eat here! sit in this nice comfy $375984 couch and consume food costing $375984 just because you know you want to!\" thats usually a good sign for me (I'm not saying it is for my wallet).  The servers have to not only be friendly but look friendly and look like they actually want to come back every 2 minutes to check on how I'm enjoying my meal. And the bread. The bread must be impeccable, because what kind of classy restaurant serves crappy bread?! If you ever want to test what restaurant will actually serve good food, try their bread. If it sucks, leave, but make sure you eat all of the bread first, even though it sucks. If it doesnt...well that's up to you whether or not you want to gip them for their complimentary bread or actually stay for the rest of the meal.   Anyway, the atmosphere of a restaurant is the probably most important thing to me. My favorite aspect of this Canaletto is that it not only has a partially open view out to the public without actually sitting \"outside,\" making it the perfect balance between an intimate private date and a more relaxed nice dinner out with family or friends, but it's also situated right next to what would be the town square of the Grand Canal Shoppes. Several times throughout the day, opera singers, jugglers, and people on stilts will parade around the Shoppes  and end their show right smack dab in front of Canaletto. So, when I'm lucky, I get dinner and a free show.   Now, onto the food. Like I said, a good classy restaurant must have delicious bread. I'm not talking upgraded hoagies and buns with butter, I mean freshly baked artisan bread with some kind of dip or sauce. And of course, it has to be an unlimited bread basket. And even though I stuff my face with their delicious olive loaf, ciabatta and sourdough slices, I still can't wait to eat the rest of the meal.  For some reason, every nice restaurant I go to that I see fried calamari, I have to order it. The calamari here is fried to a golden, delicate crisp, with homemade tomato and tartar sauce. Get a bit of both sauces on the calamari and it's like tart, crunchy, buttery perfection having a party in your mouth.   I've been here so many times that I've actually tried quite a few entrees. I once ordered the prosciutto, cheese, and arugula pizza with white truffle oil. My only gripe was the prosciutto slices were much to big to be topping a simple white pizza. Everytime I wanted a perfect bite of prosciutto, cheese and arugula, I'd get the entire slice of prosciutto and then there wouldn't be proscuitto left for my next bite, dumb. I also tried the pastas, which were pretty standard, nothing you can't find in every Italian restaurant, but they were cooked to aldente and weren't overflowing with cheese.   So, even though the appeal of this restaurant is more for me the atmosphere and service, the food is delicious, no doubt, and the service is always superb.",

We all got an array of dishes and I could tell the good from the bad. The bread was fresh and the oil and vinegar was the best quality. I ordered the special of the day which was ravioli stuffed with various cheeses (too many for me to remember) in a spicy marinera sauce. I thought it was cooked extremely well with so much flavor. The dishes that caught my eye for the wrong reasons was the pizzas. Two of the girls ordered pizzas (for some weird reason) and you could tell it wasn't very good because they were actively trying to trade slices for other dishes. I tried a few other dishes, they were good but not mind blowing. Another odd note: since we were right by the kitchen and the chefs were all faced towards us, we would catch them staring in a very creepy way. Just a little weird. Other than that, I thought this place was a decent Italian restaurant.",

I made a reservation for a large party and the manager gave us a very nice semi private area. I asked for some special cooking instructions for my meal and it was carried out exactly as I had hoped! The service was very good as well!",

We were a big group and they accommodated us very well, giving us a private room on the second floor overlooking the heart of the grand canal shoppes of the venetian. Sitting right next to the balconies, we could see the gondola area, shops, and just other beautiful scenery. Great backdrop to take photos. Service was excellent and friendly. The food was OK, nothing spectacular. Not totally unauthentic, but I expected much more from the italian cuisine since it was the venetian after all. The food was filling, but nothing mind-blowing.",

It wasn't poor quality it just wasn't good Italian food.  I have pretty high standards for Italian food (I'm from NY and have many many Italian family members and friends) and it takes a lot to impress me.  The service was great, the location in the Venetian is great too.  There happened to be a lot of weddings when we were there so we got to watch them doing all their pictures which was fun for my friend and I.  (I dont' think our husbands were that interested though....)  I was, however,  impressed with the diversity of champagnes and sparkling wines on their menu.    There are just so many options in Vegas I don't think we'll return here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Came with my boyfriend here for lunch, I found this place to be awfully cute. Made it feel like I was actually in Venice or something, and no, I have never been to Venice, or anywhere in Europe for that fact (I'm a poor college girl). For a restaurant located indoors, it felt like you were outdoors, and pigeon that was walking around contributed to that.  We had the Bruschetta al Pomodoro for our appetizer. I loved this that if my boyfriend ever learned how to make this, he would definitely be a keeper (not that he isn't already). We each ordered a pasta dish which was good. The place is quite affordable, especially for a restaurant located in the Venetian, the dishes usually average to a price of 13 to 15 dollars.  I think the turn-off of this restaurant was the overabundance of crowds here due to the little show they have every hour or so, but I guess that's expected during the lunch hours on the weekend. I'm sure this place would be more romantic when the crowd starts thinning out.",

All in all, I am 75% satisfied with this place.  If I were paying more attention, and not, you know, so focused on working the room, that percentage number might have been a little bit lower.",

The \"outdoor\" patio (in the faux outdoor square but still cool) sucked us in to look at the menu and the spaghetti with maine lobster preeeeettty much sealed the deal with me haha.  We made reservations on the spot for 2100 and came back later after we had got dressed up.  Fresh baked bread with oil & balsamic vinegar to start it off and some wine for the lady and agua for me (don't drink wine really).  The girl serving us was super preggo but really nice and on the ball.  I got that Spaghetti with Maine Lobster and it was gooooooooood... nom nom.  Spaghetti was really buttery but feck it... it was good man - I'll just run an extra mile ;)   Girl got a chicken breast that had some spicy honey mustard kind of stuff but was good, I think she thought it was mediocre.  Skipped dessert actually but the price was fair for nice dining in Vegas.  My lobster thing was $37 and with 2 wine glasses for the girl and nice tip I got out for about $110.  Not bad for Vegas... and cheaper than where we were going to go.  I'll definitely go back in the future.",

    "text": "We were standing there in St. Mark's square trying to decide whether to try Postrio, Canaletto or Otto and went to Yelp! for help. The winner at that time among the three was Canaletto, so we grabbed a table and gave it a try.  The outdoor even though you're indoor cafe seating is pretty perfect for people watching. I like this location better than competitors Postrio and Otto because it's closer to the canal and you get to see more people. Note, this is a very loud venue due to the continual performances by the Venetian entertainers, mimes, singers, jugglers and other performance artists just about 20 yards away and the crowds that they draw. Still, it's a great place to sit and enjoy a casual meal.  We ordered the four station pizza and all four varieties were tasty. The bread was excellent and the pizza crust fresh, with fresh, flavorful ingredients. We also ordered the pricey but delicious shrimp and garlic linguine. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimp were tender and juicy.  We also ordered a few different wines by the glass, all were good. Service was friendly and prompt, food was presented well and with the exception of the over-dressed salad, everything was top-notch.  I'm going to return here, but only after I try Otta and Postrio to decide which is best.",

Our waiters were attentive and the food was delicious. We came for a very late seating around 10pm and the service did not suffer one bit. We would have thought we were their first customers of the day.   Bread = perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and doughy inside with olive oil and vinegar for dipping.   Seafood Pasta - Pasta was perfect al dente and the seafood was very fresh and flavorful.   I don't remember what the dish I had was called, but it was pasta stuffed with chicken and lots of yummy sauce...it was extremely rich and heavy but was worth every bite.   Last but not least, our champagne drinks infused with strawberry puree was a real treat.   I highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "A tradition for us has been to eat here on major holidays when we visit Las Vegas. Besides the major holidays, we have made a tradition of coming here for New Year's Eve Dinner. If you do come on by, ask for Jesse or Jean-Carlos. Both waiters have been the best so far. Even this year when there was a set menu, the waiters will try to accommodate you. The usual holiday pizza is pizza marghareti. Pizza Cristina is the one we usually order which has proscuitto ham. We got that instead of the regular pizza that was on the set menu. The staff is very warming and you feel like you are in Italy when you dine here. The risotto is to die for. We tend to either order the linguine with the seafood or seafood risotto!  To top off that of, we order the tiramisu for dessert. No restaurant yet has been able to beat their tiramisu. Since I live in California, we go to their sister restaurant which is Il Fornaio. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, overall. When I am gambling myself in the Venetian or Palazzo, I tend to get this craving for the tiramisu. So, I will stop gambling, head over to Canaletto and order a cappuccino and tiramisu. What a treat. When I could be gambling and losing money, I treat myself to a wondrous treat! It does not get better than this! I am in heaven! If you love seafood, come and order the linguine with shrimp, mussels, and clams. If you are not big on seafood, then order the ravioli, or spaghetti. But definitely for sure order the tiramisu!  for more my reviews, check out my blog. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftastypalateandfoodie.blogspot.com&s=9e666caa8c5b7ca67f161d1fcf0d9de72e135c6625a977e9a98eb9670d4c801d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tastypalateandfoodie.blo...</a>",

    "text": "Yet another group meal that I hosted while I was in Vegas for our convention.  Canaletto is convenient being right near the escalators that go down to the meeting room portion of the Venetian.  Now what made this place stand out to me was the service.  Right off the bat, the hostess was very accommodating when I told her that I didn't know any of my dining companions and could I wait somewhere that she could send them since it was a little early for my reservation.  She sat me at my table right away and then sent my party over to me.  Our waitress was super friendly and knew just how much attention to give us.  She suggested entrees for everyone based on some of their likes and dislikes.  We all started with either the house salad or the minstrone soup.  The soup was really good.  The salads also looked really nice.  I was excited for my meal when I started off with soup this tasty.  For lunch I had the seafood risotto and I really wanted to like it.  But it was just not all that good.  It was kind of salty and the shrimp were overcooked.  The risotto itself was rather bland, with no real outstanding flavor.  I should have gotten the canneloni as one of my dining partners did because she loved every bite.  The two mahi mahi specials were also well liked.  We were too full for dessert so we had to pass, but the capuccino was really nice.  This is a good place to stop by for lunch if you're having meetings in the Venetian like we were, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here.  It really turned out to be your basic, Olive Garden type Italian food.",

We had our post wedding dinner at Canaletto then and were delighted with it so much that we came back for our vow renewal last weekend. I worked with Kelly who got us a room so we could have an intimate dinner with our friends and family. Which we thoroughly appreciated. We went with menu A which features: a salad with a thin lovely slice of I believe pecorino cheese on a lightly dressed plate of mixed greens and two slices of crostini, a large bowl of pasta with bacon, pork and mushrooms in a light sauce or roasted chicken or a ravioli. (That's what our guests got) They were all delighted with what they had. We had three guests who are gluten free and vegetarian and they were able to accommodate them with gluten free pastas and sides of roasted veggies. My son had a large amazing thin crust cheese pizza that my husband devoured our son's leftovers for breakfast the next morning. They continually replenished our table with freshly made rolls that looked like they were lovely leaves on a vine. For dessert we had crepes with sauteed apples and green apple sorbet that was divine.  Our server, Jesse, was such a gentleman. He took exquisite care of us and treated our kids like they were adult guests. It was very refreshing. I could not have asked for more from a terrific waiter.",

She threw one at us with an ironic facial expression, then turned her back to us and started whispering something to her colleagues, then they all looked back at us and chuckled... Felt like they were looking at a bunch of clowns (us).. We were stunned; we are not funny looking people. Didn't know what else to do, so we just left.\r \r Hope your experience will be better! If you can pass through the initial hurdle (and if you get approved by the host or hostess) then I guess you will savor great Italian specialties, and your mood will be intact. Good luck!",

    "text": "Awful experience... definitely put a bad taste in my mouth.  We were a group of four expecting to sit down to a nice dinner. The other couple had dined here previously with a fantastic memory to share so we thought we would have the same experience.  Interior: We were seated inside the main dining room. I looked around the restaurant at the decor and was very pleased with what i saw from the lighting to the wall treatments (i'm an interior architect and deisgner).  Service: When our petite server (male) approached our table he asked what we would like to order. I let him know that I needed a few more minutes and he rolled his eyes in disgust and said it's just something to drink to which I had to respond that I had not looked over the wine list yet. It was appalling how rude and terse he was. He walked away from our table and disappeared for 20-30 minutes (no exaggeration). I saw him walking around the restaurant. He would look at me start to walk over and then turn and walk away. When he finally returned to our table we were all so disgusted but ordered anyway. Perhaps the food would cheer us up? ummmmmmm keep reading.  Food: The food was COLD. I don't know if it was an act of rebellion to let our food sit up on the line for a long time before delivering it but my ravioli was icy when i received it. I heard similar responses from around our table. Another person mentioned that theirs were bland.   This dialogue took place at our table. one: This reminds me of something i would get at the olive garden. two: No, I think this would be an insult for the olive garden. one: I think you're right, plus the olive garden comes with better service. At least there you would receive bottomless glasses of water.  This place definitely put a damper on our weekend. I say skip it and put your money elsewhere.",

Anyways, the wait staff was a little sluggish that night.  They brought our food out but had my boyfriend's order wrong.  Instead of cannelloni, he got a salmon dish which we asked to take back.  So we had to wait for his dinner to come out.  :(  For the amount we paid, I think we should have gotten better service.  At the end of the night, our waiter was standing watching the game instead of making sure our check was closed out.  We had to wave him down.  Oh yeah.....dessert was fabulous.  All in all food was good but service needs improving.  Atmosphere was romantic and sweet.",

Service was quick which was nice, as I was exploring fine dining with a toddler-always a challenge. Bread with a vinegar oil dip was served immediately, and our orders taken quickly.   The magherita pizza was very good, quite authentic and tasty. My son was especially fond of it.  The veal scaloppini was good I think...I am not a veal fan but tried a bite and it came with grilled eggplant and caprese, yum!  The beef risotto was very rich with butter, rosemary, red wine flavors that accented the beef well.  Plates are generally $20+ and not huge portions, which is a common theme in the Venetian.   Other waiters and waitresses stopped by to make sure we had a good dining experience and to wave at my child. That was nice.",

Our waiter was from northern Italy which explained the Italian accent and he seemed to smile more than the rest of the staff. I started off w/ a glass of the house merlot which wasn't bad, then decided on the...COSTATA DI MANZO* 41.99 Grilled 22 oz. bone-in prime rib-eye served with sauteed organic spinach, roasted Yukon Gold potatoes and baked cannellini beans. This was an awesome meal...best rib-eye I've eaten in LV. If you can overcome the \"indifference\" attitude of some of the wait/buss staff and focus on the meal. Your taste buds will thank you.",

    "text": "Such a cute place in the Venitian!  Really does make you feel like you're in Europe somewhere, and even comes with pigeons......?!? Uh, that was kinda gross actually.  I understand the authenticity and all, but I don't really like pigeons eatting scraps around my feet during a meal.  We came here around 9:30pm - I think they were getting ready to close since it wasn't crowded at all.  Plus all the shops were closing too, so the crowds were thinning out.  Great ambiance - definitely sit \"outside\" versus inside.  Great for people watching! (and bird watching too, i guess)  We actually just wanted a snack but apparently to eat on the \"outdoor patio\" you need to order more than just an appetizer.  Lucky for us the pizza's are thin crust. Problem solved.  The menu wasn't too heavy, but it was a little hard to choose considering we weren't super hungry.  For an app, we ordered the bruschetta - YUM.  Such a simple and small appetizer, but yet so tasty.  Then we got the stagione pizza (something like that).  It had 4 different ingredients, one on each slice.  Pretty good too, not too filling, and it was big enough for us to share.  We hung out for a bit after eating, and the wait staff didn't mind at all.  Nice to not feel rushed, and just relax after a day of walking everywhere.  We'd definitely come back for the ambiance, and food of course!  And maybe to see what craziness the pigeons do to the customers......",

I got the Pizza con salsiccia which I absolutely love. It looks just like it does on the streets of Venice, but tastes NOTHING like it.  Sorely disappointed.  The service basically sucked.  They sat us right next to the kitchen and the bathrooms so we got to see all this yummy food being sent out of the kitchen, of course none of it was ours.  Finally it took maybe 30 minutes to get our food and when they brought it, it was cold.  My friends were also not impressed with their food.  I highly recommend going some place else.",

    "text": "A for Ambience. A+ for FOOD. 4,5 stars for the rating but I'm rounding up because I feel like it, and because I can.  The Risotto..... oh, that damned Risotto, I can't stop thinking about that Risotto.  Bursts of flavor... mushrooms, saffron. whatever -  a perfect risotto, I think could eat pots full of this stuff for years. We also had a sea bass dish - - flavorful, and cooked perfectly -  tender and absolutely fresh.  Yum.  Their fresh mozzarella and tomato was .... well, it was good, but keep in mind that the tomato is baked, and the mozzarella is melted on, unlike the regular fresh mozzie you'd expect.  I prefer it the other way, but it tasted good nonetheless.  We sat out on the patio, eating under the pseudo-but-wonderfully-bright Venice skies, surrounded by gorgeous architecture and statues, not to mention the Italian melodies that floated through the air, assisted by the great acoustics at the Venetian Grand Canal area....  We were on a major timecrunch as we had to leave for the airport in 45 minutes.  This was to be the last meal during this particular Vegas trip.  We were assured we'd leave in time, we sat down to order, and our server was attentive enough to be good, but also left us alone to eat.  The food came out quickly, though I am not sure if this is because we made it clear were in a rush, and it was served percfectly.  We even had time left for coffee, but as is the case in the whole damned hotel - - the coffee leaves much to be desired.  Blech.  I swear, I say it again and again, that is the only bad thing about the Venetian.  BLECHY COFFEE.  We were surrounded by people on dates, early dinner meetings, as well as families with many, many children.  Canaletto's is one of those places that is appropriate for any age group, for any purpose, however formal or casual.  Oh, and the bread... with great olive oil.... ahh.  Did I mention the freakin' RISOTTO????????  Holy smokes........",

    "text": "Most vistors to Venice make a beeline to the Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square). Located at the mouth of the Grand Canal, it is bordered on three sides by the Procuratie Vecchie, the Napoleonic Wing of the Procuraties and the Procuratie Nuove. On the east side of the square is the beautiful St. Mark's Basilica, the Campanile (bell tower) and a smaller Piazzetta that opens up to the Venetian Lagoon and is also bordered by the magnificent Doge's Palace. It is the lowest spot in Venice and the first to flood. When it isn't flooding, it is home to countless thousands of tourist-savvy pigeons along with museums and cafe tables.    Most visitors to Vegas find themselves in the Venetian at some point. Out front, there is a copy of the Campanile and a small lagoon. Inside, the vast shopping mall winds its way alongside a canal until it emerges into an indoor square with a roof that always remains baby blue and is accented by wispy clouds. It's the scaled-down Vegas version of St. Mark's Square. This square is lined with shops and restaurants and a cobbled-together assortment of facades that have been borrowed from the Venetian Procuraties and the Doge's Palace. It's kitschy (isn't all of the Vegas strip?), but it works. It does have two advantages over the real St. Mark's: (1) no pigeons and (2) no flooding.  Ref: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g?select=s6qvo9vqN2jFgV5Z-zApTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wPiR...</a>  On my recent trip to Vegas, we had spent our first afternoon browsing through shops in the Venetian and Palazzo and were famished. The \"outdoor\" cafe-style dining offered by Canaletto in St. Mark's Square looked awfully good at that point and we made a beeline over there. Once seated, you have an eerie sensation that you really are outside, sitting in a piazza. Over the course of the meal, we listened to two musical ensembles performing in the square. The first was a costumed troupe masquerading as Venetians that sang a series of operatic standards by Rossini, Verdi and Mozart. They made up for their lack of vocal talent (they sounded like rejects from a local opera studio) with enthusiasm and verve. It just became a bit tiresome when they began performing their not-quite-wretched renditions of perennial Italian favorites including \"O Sole Mio\" and \"Funiculi Funicula.\" The second group, consisting of an accordion player, a flautist and a guitarist who had a very nice tenor voice, was a significant upgrade. We finished our main course listening to a fun arrangement of \"La donna e mobile\" from Rigoletto and knew it was time to finish dessert upon hearing \"O Sole Mio\" again.  Canaletto's food? Top notch! I had a pasta special in a sumptuous butter sauce and bisque reduction that was punctuated by prawns, clams, scallops and several varieties of fish. Delicioso! I sampled my wife's cannelloni which was very serviceable. A friend's salmon in lemon oil and parsley sauce was excellent. My taste buds were well-lubricated with a good glass of Chianti and I was able to smile at that second rendition of \"O Sole Mio\" because my palate was happily vibrating to the taste of a good tiramisu and cappuccino.  Our busy waitress did a disappearing act when it came time to settle the bill. Normally, I wouldn't think twice about this when good conversation was flowing along with wine in a relaxed setting, but several in our party were worn out and wanted to go back to their hotel rooms. When she did reappear, I smiled because my wife's and my portion of the bill only came to $85 with tip. I thought this very reasonable for a restaurant in the Venetian. Canaletto gets four stars and two thumbs up from me!",

We took the next available because of our hunger.  We started with the calamari.. Which was bad.. A little stale textured and not tasty.  Although, there was complimentary bread plate for the table, which had little rolls and slices of different breads, which was good.  I got a plate which included grilled salmon(1)  seabass(1)  prawns(1)   and scallops(2) with lemon, herb, some garlic and butter, which came   with a little bit of string beans and carrots and one grilled polenta.   It was really small pieces but i ate the whole plate and my stomach   was very satisfied and not too full.  Left some room for some gelato   ( which I will be yelping right after this).  We were celebrating a birthday so we told our waiter and he was very   good about bringing it out right after dinner. They brought out a   square slice of tiramisu for the birthday celebrant. Which I approve,   the tiramisu was very good, not overwhelming with the alcolhol.  The waiter had also comped the tiramisu, as he should, because it's a beeday.  The service was okay.  All in all.. i'll give it another shot!",

St. Mark's square was carefully created to replicate the same piazza in Venice, down to the very finest detail! (Including a pigeon...which we think came in by accident!) :).   The prices are a bit high, but given the ambience, service, and quality, it's nothing shocking. The menu has a variety of items to satisfy any palette, and a range of prices for those on a budget.   The pizzas are delicious and prepared with few, but fresh ingredients. The pasta bolognese is light and flavorful, and the chef is extremely generous with the meat!  The wine list is extensive. Not as many Italian wines by the glass, but by the bottle the list is good.   Definitely ask for a table out in the piazza for some great people watching, and some nice live music to accompany the meal. The waitstaff is incredibly friendly. Our server was from Italy, so it was fun to chat with him in Italian. And the manager or proprietor (not sure what his exact position was) came over to check on us, and also offer us free admission to LAVO after.

Atmosphere:  We sat in the outdoor area, complete with a brightly painted sky dome above us. A string quartet was playing lovely Italian and Frank Sinatra-type music.

I forgive him because he tried to be attentive to all patrons, there were just too many so that didn't work out too well--at one point he celebrated a customer's 90th birthday with her, which was very sweet.   Anticipating slower service, I suggest arriving 1 1/2 -2 hours early if you have show reservations or other plans.",

The fish was overcooked and mushy. My dinner companion had steak with very overcooked spinach. The one highlight of the evening was a very good cheese plate that wehad as an appetizer. There are so many great restaurants now in Vegas that I will likely not be back.",

Not anymore......we were so embarrassed that it turned out to be an expensive, $300.+ for four people,disaster. Our friends wanted us to try a Venetian Spitz, which is a typical Venetian aperitif. It is made with an Italian Bitter such as Compari or Aperol, white wine or Prosecco and a Splash of soda water. They ordered 4, 2 each. When they arrived they were in large wine glasses full of ice. The Aperol one was watered down with mostly soda water but the \"Compari\" one was the best. It not only had ice and a minimal amount of perhaps some Compari and the wine? A red wine. When we pointed this out to the waiter he argued with us that this was the \"new Compari\" purple in color......LOL He wasn't all to keen to help us as he didn't care and when about his business. Eventually a man, who we assumed was a manager, descended from his office and we were able to get his attention. He apologized and said he would replace them After about 10 min he returned with the correct Aperol one but not the Compari ones. In the interest of good customer service the manager did not remove them from the bill, then took off his coat and sat at the bar. We then ordered the wine a Soave, it was good, and a Pinot Nero (Noir). The Pinot Nero was misrepresented as being from Alto-Adage but was actually Trentino. Though they are technically the same politically, they are considered separate wine areas. As we had so much trouble with the Arparitifs we did not mention that wine was bad, oxidized, even though it was only two years old. We regretted, our fault, not sending this back. The food was good but by this time..the evening was ruined. While the manager was at the bar, so was one of the waiters at the service station. As my husband walked to the toilet he observed one of the waiters take a glass of white wine, that was on a tray with other dirty glasses, pouring the half filled glass into a paper cup and then drink it. Chink chink This is a chain maybe HQ should make the surprise visit.",

    "text": "We recently came to Las Vegas to celebrate my Birthday and one of the main things we were looking forward to was the gourmet food!!! On the second night that we were there, I was surprised with a night out at the BEAUTIFUL Caneletto Restaurant located in St. Mark's Square at the Venetian Hotel. We said outside of the main restaurant where we had a remarkable view of the piazza. The ceiling is painted powder blue with white fluffy clouds so you actually feel like you are eating outside at a street cafe in Italy!!! To start, my Bear had the Insalata Di Pere which was absolutely delicious! It had fresh arugula, grilled pears, grapes, endives, crumbled blue cheese and toasted pecans topped off with a pomegranate dressing. I opted for the traditional Caprese Calda that came with fresh sliced Mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and drizzled with balsamic reduction. For our main dishes, my Bear had Vermicelli Al Pomodoro that came with angel hair pasta, chopped fresh tomatoes, marinara sauce, fresh basil, garlic and olive-oil. He tends to love lighter-sauced dishes which this certainly was, however it was accompanied by a VERY distinct \"firy, woody, burned\" taste to it. He had me try it and I instantly could taste it for myself. We were the last seating of the night, so it made us wonder if maybe the sauce had burned at the bottom of the pot and that was what they used. I myself had the Tagliatelle Alla Castellana with Pasta ribbons tossed with pork tenderloin, bacon, shiitake mushrooms, Grana Padano and thyme in a cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious and the taste was very rich due to the thickness of the sauce so I realistically could have had half the portion. I wasn't even close to finishing the bowl and I felt awful wasting such delicious food! Our waiters were all very professional and prompt and encouraged us to view the dessert menu, however by the time we finished our dishes, neither of us had any room! I would certainly recommend this place to anyone passing through the canal shops, and I would say it would probably be a great lunch spot as well! Service was 5 star and the was about a 3.5. I hope this serves as beneficial to any upcoming tourists!",

They were so nice though we never even realized it! We got everything family style and honestly, there was not one thing we ordered that went unfinished or unappreciated. We started with the carpacchio con ruchetta, which was perfect. I have to admit that while I've never had bad carpacchio, I'm sure it exists, and I have had overly dressed or on the contrary very bland carpacchio. This was fabulous; it was lemony enough and most importantly salty enough with the perfect proportion of parmesan and arugula. Overall, super tasty. We also split the insalata di pere, which had lots of yummy, tangy blue cheese and was a really well put together salad. For our entrees we got the Salsiccia Piccante pizza, Barilotti Integrali Al Forno, and the Gnocchi Bolognese. All were delicious and among the five of us, we closed the restaurant down and ate every last morsel of food. This place was great at 12 am, the waiter was nice, they refilled our water very frequently and overall we had a good time. The bread and olive oil was very delicious and overall this place was great.",

The food was amazing! Moist Chicken Breasts, and Grilled Salmon. Crusty bread with olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip, and tiramisu. There was also a pasta course which is normally Penne alla Vodka, but we requested it changed to Pomodoro sauce and they were all to happy to make the change. Soft drinks are not included in the dinner, but once the first was ordered it was free refills. (A feature most restaurants we looked at did not offer). We orginally were going to pay for alcohol on consumption, but our waiter suggested wine for the tables and beer. He pointed out that this discourages excessive mixed drink ordering. The fact that he was trying to SAVE us money surprised me, but impressed me too! We had 3 small kids in the party, so the restaurant was accomodating in letting them order a la carte. No kids menu, but they enjoyed their pizza and pasta. They set up our cake table, and even placed family photos with TLC on there as well. Music from the restaurant could be heard in our room, with a knob to adjust volume as we wanted it. Lowered for the Best Man's toast, and raised so that we could have our dance.  Believe me, we searched EVERYWHERE for the best place to have this dinner, and the price, service, quality of food and atmosphere didn't disappoint. It was a great memory we'll treasure always!",

My only complaint was that this restaurant offers a great happy hour from 4-6, but patrons can only be seated in the bar for these prices. The bar seating is limited, and patrons are advised to stand around and wait for other patrons to leave to take their table/chairs. The management and hostess were not very accommodating for our party, as all of the tables were taken and we had 2 minors with us. However, two servers were VERY helpful, and made sure to help us get a table without looking like vultures - Xavier and Adelia, thank you for your kindness!   My advice to the restaurant management is to rethink the seating options to accommodate more people who patronize the business between 4-6 pm for the happy hour prices.",

Being from Philadelphia, we enjoy great restaurants, especially italian places, but this delivered. We had some apps, pizza and entrees and all were excellent. Service and venue were up to task.

Many times we have had a server that we had a little issue understanding and were a little intimidated by (try pronouncing their menu items without completely butchering their native language!  Just point...it's easier!) as we have gotten a little eye roll after attempting to pronounce our entree selection...but this time we had a sever that started out amazing.   Very easy to understand (even HE didn't speak Italian, so there was no worry about mispronunciation!) he even talked me into jumping out of my comfort zone of the same 2 dishes each and every time I go there, into a FABULOUS new fave....   Tagliatelle Alla Castellana Con Pollo ...   I was excited to have him as a server and looked forward to interacting with him throughout the meal for possible other choices for after dinner drinks, coffee and/or dessert.  Unfortunately, he dropped off the drinks, took our order and he didn't come back to the table until we were finished with our HUGE meals (yet he walked right by about 6-8 times) and were ready for the check.  The food although was perfection!  Still will be on out must-do list for Vegas, but is a solid second choice to Stack at Mirage.",

    "text": "Located in Venetian near the living statue performers towards back.   Two different trips and visits. First visit was last March. Recent visit confirmed our opinions of the restaurant.   Each time we were friendly greeted and escorted by the hostess to the table and bar respectively. Each visit the courteous servers and bartenders were efficient to exchange pleasantries and to take drink orders.   Both trips we ordered pizzas and wine. First trip we ordered a salumeria assortita. Included int eh salami sampler was coppa, speck, bresaola, salame de parma, prosciutto san daniele. Salami sampler was a balance of savory, spicy, and smoked salumi meats. Also served was freshly made bread with vinegarette and oil. Bread was warm and soft. We finished like three baskets before the end of the meal.   Second trip we had the bruschetta. Fresh tomatoes and cheese on a grilled ciabatta. A simple overpriced bruschetta. Ciabatta bread was a little more grilled than expected. Tomato helped to draw out some of the toughness seen with bread used for bruschetta. Otherwise little bruschetta for price paid.   For the pizzas we have ordered the salsiccia piccante and calzone.   Salsiccia with sausage, peppers, onion, mozzarella, and pepperoni sauce. Ingredients generously found on slice of the pizza. Fresh hot out of the oven. Bursting with aroma and strong on flavors was the pizza. This was a good pizza and it will leave you full.   Calzone with mushroom, mozzarella, ricotta, and ham. A fairly sized calzone with equal amounts of the various ingredients. Hints of sweetness from the sauce and seasoned appropriately for the encumbering the hot meat cheese and vegetables. Crust was a little burnt but not to the point of hurting the taste.  Each visit we have had wine. Large selection and good recommendations of the bar staff can be found here. One of the choices became one of my favorites. William Hill Chardonnay, Central Coast 2012. Crisp refreshing and sweet.   Staff is personal and knowledgeable of menus. Service and kitchen are efficient. Food is okay overall with some stellar plates and some plates with some minor corrections needed. Regular prices are competitive and happy hour deals are fairly good.   Overall three stars. Would be four stars without burnt calzone and the  lackluster bruschetta. Will likely be back for happy hour wine and pizzas.",

The Better Half loves Wild Mushrooms and Truffles, so she told the server and the chef put together this dish for her.  I had a few bites and it was awesome!  Sometimes all you have to do is ask.  I had the Gnocchi and it was also very good.  They were soft and pillowy and a little al dente....there's a trick to cooking Gnocchi well and they have it down pat here.  The Cheesy and Creamy Sauce was perfect.  For dessert, we split a Chocolate Cake and Ice Cream....actually, I only had 1 bite.  TBH ate the rest of it....LOL.  It was very rich and sweet....perfect after a nice meal.  Our server was awesome.....very attentive and willing to go the extra mile to ensure our dining experience was top notch.  I'll definitely be back.  Return Factor - 100%",

They go above and beyond to make sure your meal/experience is a good one.   When it comes to the food - it breaks down in two sections. Let's start off with the 5 star section.   The bread (I know who rates the bread...me) is delicious. I could make a meal of just eating a loaf or two. And the penne ala vodka is lick the bowl good. The pasta is homemade and the sauce is perfect. Literally I wanted to lick the bowl :-) Oh and the pear four cheese ravioli - OH MY GOD - It was brought out for us just to sample with our meals. So rich and delicious, I was cursing myself that I didn't order it as my main meal.   However the fried shrimp, bruschetta and risotto ball is about three stars. The shrimp and risotto ball were a bit over fried and greasy for me and the bruschetta was a bit dry. The salad and steak were also three stars. The salad was average - nothing too exciting on the place. And the steak was just so-so. Sadly, I could have cooked a better one at home (for a third of the price). Not to mention, I really didn't like the sides - roasted potato and a sprinkling of mixed vegetables. Again, nothing to write home about.",

Location: right in the heart of grand canal shops, along the canal itself, set across from street performers barking out opera classics like bocelli's time to say goodbye among others.    2.  Space: huge, 5 rooms, multi level and incredible detail even down to the bathrooms.  3.  Lest us not forget the cuisine.  How the hell they get the freshest ingredients in the middle of the desert I do not know, but the oysters, basil, mushrooms, mozzarella, risotto, fish, beef, etc was to dine for!  We had many items but were most pleased with the risotto - best ever!  pizza - quattro stagioni...yummy, fresh oysters on the half shell (high quality & frrrrresh), caprese, chicken cataloni.  4.  Service.  Genuine Italiano's wait on you in fun little suits.  How cool is that?    5.  Bread.  I know this is a weird category, but they bread provided along with olive oil/vinegar combo disappeared like the city of pompei.  So friggin good.    6.  Consistency.  We were in vegas for 4 nights, and managed to dine here...3 times!!!  Even more impressive was that we stayed at other hotels and went to great lengths to get here each time.  The only room for improvement here is on the beverages.  If this is Italy then I want Limonata - (san pellegrino) and chocolate sprinkles on my cappuccino.  Other than that, this place is perfect.",

    "text": "3 STARS (1 Star for the Food, 2 Stars for the Ambiance)  My bf and I choose Canaletto as our last stop for a late lunch before heading back home to SF. The prices seemed decent considering it was in the Venetian, and the ambiance was beautiful. So, Canaletto it was.  Service was slow, but good thing the ambiance was amazing--views of St. Mark's Square! It gave you the feeling of eating outdoors although you were actually inside (i.e . paintings of bright blue skies). Also, there was free bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can enjoy while you waited for your meal. The bread was nice & warm and oil/vinegar paired well with it.      We ordered the Pizza Con Salsiccia and Pennoni Al Ragu:  *Pizza Con Salsiccia (Pizza with Spicy Sausage): Ehh, BAD! The crust was hard, and the base of the pie was chewy not crispy. It was extremely oily; there were oil wells throughout the pizza. The sausage was suppose to be spicy but it wasn't.  And, the bell peppers was clearly out of the can (it was a faded green color and drenched in oil) and was inedible. So, needless to say, this combination made me feel nauseas afterwards.   *Pennoni Al Ragu: Essentially penne with meat sauce was just ok; nothing special. The penne was cooked al dente, just the way I like it. But, the meat sauce tasted like Prego and didn't have much depth of flavor to it. BTW, you have to ask for Parmesan cheese, they don't give it to you--weird!  The only saving grace for Canaletto is the location which is breathtaking.  Just to note, after eating, we passed by Postrio's and noticed the pricing was similar to Canaletto. Gosh darn it, we should have went there instead! Well, there's always next time...",

    "text": "If you want a quick, light lunch, the bar service at Canaletto might be right up your alley.  Bar staff are congenial, you don't have to squeeze yourself into a \"patio\" table, and drinks/food come quick.  The fried sardines with olive oil, peppercorns, and vinegar-pickled onions was probably the best thing I've had to eat so far this week. Large sardines are butterflied, very lightly battered, deep fried, and chilled. Dressed with the oil and onions, you get the rich oiliness of the fish, the peppery olive oil and peppercorns, and then the tart vinegar onions cut through and freshen the whole thing up. I sopped up every last bit of the plate with crusty bread.  Insalata di Pere is a pear salad with very fresh young greens, radicchio, fennel, bleu cheese, toasted pecans, red grapes, and a light olive oil and lemon dressing. Very fresh flavors, and went very well with the chilled fish. Add in a cold Peroni and it's a perfect lunch break.",

The only downside was long trek up two flights of stairs for restroom, but at least it was clean and well decorated!

The service was outstanding, however, the food failed miserably. I had the risotto with shrimp, crab and artichokes. It was tasteless, undercooked, overpriced and didn't improve with salt.   My cocktail, a lemon drop, which I choked down was so bland and uninteresting.   I will say as I have before, the best one I've had was at Maggiano's at Fashion Show Mall. I was so looking forward to this dining experience as I've strolled by on many different occasions and thought it would be the ideal place.  NOPE!",

I stopped by this place completely on a whim and not even bother researching it (bad Yelper, i know!) and boy were we not disappointed! My party and I were tired after a long day of shopping at the Grand Canal and stopped by for lunch here. We each got something fairly different and the were not disappointed.  The margherita pizza offered a great flavor profile and the freshness of the product clearly came through. The potato gnocchi was simply fantastic and while I was never a big fan of gnocchi, I quickly became one.  The wine list is very extensive and not bad considering this is vegas! Great place to check out and if this isn't what Italian should taste like, yikes, I am never staying at the Venetian again!",

Pasta was cooked properly, which (given how bland the sauce was) surprised me.  The salads weren't fresh, neither were the tomatoes.  In winter, this is forgivable, but not in mid-June.  Service: Inattentive, mostly useless.  Glacially slow, had so much difficulty in charging the meal to my room that I gave up and switched to my credit card.    Ambiance: The cheap plastic chairs have seen better days: they look like hell, and they're uncomfortable.  The restaurant doesn't iron their tablecloths and napkins, so the tables look ratty.  It's \"outside\", as it were, on St Mark's Square in the Venetian.  They're obviously relying on the Venetian's surroundings for their ambiance.  The china is chipped and scratched.    I won't bother going back.",

We were seated inside of the restaurant since we didn't want to wait for outdoor seating and was placed near an open window that outlooks some of the shops and the gondalas.  The service here was great, even though I think they were a bit excited to come help us in terms of clearing the plates as they swept away one of the oysters that way.  However, we took it all in stride and were happy to see that our entrees came soon after.  The table mostly stuck to eating seafood dishes and we loved it.  I enjoyed my grilled seafood dish and took a bite of my friend's pizza cristie and was equally as in love.   Overall, a great atmosphere, good food, and we had a great time.

Husband and I ordered the mushroom risotto and a stuffed pear ravioli dish. The risotto was crunchy (it had pine nuts) and cheesy without being too heavy. The pear ravioli dish was out of this world good. I was a little hesitant before ordering this as I thought the pear might make the dish sweet but that was not True. It had a balance of all flavors.  Service was very friendly. The olive oil/balsamic with bread at the start were tasty too. I just wanted other variety of bread besides the ciabatta served but they were all out of their sesame and wheat rolls.  Pretty reasonably priced- bill for 2 was 60 bucks for these 2 dishes+gratuity.

First ordered a ribbon pasta with mushrooms and chicken, the chicken was hard and almost tasteless. The margarita pizza was very oily. The other pizza we got had olives, tomatoes and some other veggies, very oily and tasted salty.  Really the only good thing was the atmosphere and that's not enough.",

The menu hanging outside the entryway looked good, so we took a chance.  The food was actually really good. Unfortunately it was barely lukewarm when they brought it to us.... cold might be more accurate, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. It had obviously been sitting in back too long.   The service was awful. Our waiter was very abrasive and never even introduced himself! At our first encounter he only said one word: \"drinks?\"   The location was perfect for our needs, but unfortunately we sat on the \"patio,\" which halfway through our meal was interrupted with the San Marcos Square performances. It was loud anyway, and when you add in a loudspeaker vocal performance, talking was out of the question.   The price was decent for what you'd expect in a strip casino.   I won't be going back.",

    "text": "I enjoyed my dinner!   As others have said, the ambiance is really amazing...you feel like you're eating at a restaurant in the streets of Italy! There's even a fake \"sky\" on the ceiling. haha. This restaurant fits in nicely with the rest of the Venetian- very classy.    We came here after watching Mystere and it was 9 pm...we were tired and didn't want to wait 30-40 minutes for a table so we agreed to sit at the bar.  That was cool because we got a good view of the olympics and got to chat with the bartender.  He told us that his favorite dish was the pear ravioli (though we didn't go with his recommendation).    I ordered the Filetto di Branzino al Proseco E Zafferano which is a seabass served over sauteed spinach.  The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection.  So moist! The portion of fish was pretty generous and I thought I'd only eat half of it but ended up eating all of it...not wanting it to go to waste.  I recommend this if you want something refreshing and light. My bf got the Petto di Pollo al Peperocino which is a free-range spicy chicken breast over sauteed spinach.  He wasn't that wowed by his dish but he got what he ordered: chicken.  I had a taste of it and it is pretty spicy...so be warned if you are not a fan of spice.  I also enjoyed the bread that they give you before your meal.  It's definitely freshly baked: crunchy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside.   On this Vegas trip, Canaletto was one of my favorite meals.  I would come back because the food was good and fresh...but also because I'm low key obsessed with the Venetian... :)",

Instead, the name Canaletto came in my mind, and so I made a reservation here.  When we got to the restaurant, we immediately knew we booked the wrong place.  After checking yelp stars and reviews, we were skeptical but decided to stay anyway.   We're glad we stayed and didn't let yelp reviews persuade us to switch restaurants.    My Linguine alla buranella was a perfect blend of tomatoes, wine, and seafood.  It was easily one of the best seafood pasta I've had.

Folks getting the happy hour deal are confined to the outdoor bar area, but we were able to snag a two-seater tallboy (part of the bar area) facing the square which was a total win.

Our server also gave us a free bread basket, which we were jazzed about since only patrons having \"real\" dinners are supplied with those.  What a delicious, stunning memorable meal.

The food is in no way award winning authentic Italian cuisine. It's basic at most & is extremely expensive. Do not order any sea food here. Maybe that's why it was so bad. I should have just ordered a pizza or something \"Italian\". See pics. Every dish will cost you an average of $45 bucks & that's without drinks so you do the math.",

While my friend and I were there a couple months ago, there was a trio of live musicians playing beautiful Italian music - a flutist, a violinist, and an accordion player, and we had a good view of them while enjoying our food.  Our server was very attentive, and our food was delicious.  They had some interesting vegetarian options, which is an absolute must for me.  If I can make it at home, why go to a restaurant and pay for it?  I had their ravioli, with a special sauce, nuts, and asparagus - very good.  I can't remember what my friend had, but he enjoyed his meal, as well.  For dessert, we decided on the tiramisu, and it was a good choice.  I definitely recommend this place, especially if you're wanting to go on the gondola rides, since this restaurant is just around the corner.",

We decided to try this restaurant because of the seven dollar happy hour sign outside the restaurant.      The service was a little bit lacking, but the food was pretty good for the happy hour menu. Our waiter's name is Aldo S., this guy does not smile, very slow in coming to our table, when he finally came to our table he says, \"Happy Hour!\"  We asked for some lemons for a water, he forgot. about it! It took forever for him to take our orders.  Finally, we got our food and we asked the guy who put the food to our table for some bread, this man was very rude, he said to us that we  have to ask your waiter!! He walked away, as if he didn't give a crap!! This is terrible service, and I blame it on the management for not training these waiters and wait staffs!! We look for our waiter for the longest time, finally, Aldo S. Came to our table. Again, we asked for lemons for our water and some bread! After about eight more minutes, Aldo came back with some sliced lemons and bread!! This waiter is obviously not happy with his job, he doesn't  smile and he acted like he's  Annoyed with us for the things we ask him for.  There are so many restaurants at the Venetian, unfortunately this waiter ruined this Nice restaurant reputation!      Everything was very delicious, but the calzone, was just too salty for me. I would come back here again, but, I hope the management would have retrained the waiters and wait staffs for better services.",

The food smelled great and everyone here seemed to be having a really great time. As I was making my way to the gondola I was impressed with the service here as well. Lots of moving bodies working together to get orders out and check on tables.  I believe there is a bar area here as well.  I do not think you need a reservation here but I would double check to be on the safe side.  Oh, if you have a google app you should get the translate so that you can make an effort to pronounce the food on the menu. It shows and effort as opposed to pointing!!!! Ahhhh, pointing is just odd!!  #enjoy",

Located in \"St. Marks Square\" you get the amazing ambiance of the open square, the entertainers, the gorgeous lighting, and the \"alfresco\" feeling. Next best thing to actually being in Italy.   The bread basket is good. Nothing crazy special, but tasty. My fave was the olive roll. The food was also very tasty and well prepared. The star dishes being the pastas.   Pasta trio (5/5 stars): rigatoni Bolognese, pear and Gorgonzola ravioli, and pesto gnocchi. All the pastas tasted very fresh, light, flavorful, and satisfying. Gnocchi can be hard to get right sometimes, but this one was perfect.   Mushroom risotto (4/5 stars): my husband said this was one of the best risottos he's had. It was a bit too sauce heavy for me, but good overall.   Veal (2/5 stars): my dad got this and hated it. He said it was tasteless and not enough sauce.   Mushroom spaghetti (3.5/5 stars): a simple but still delicious dish. Again, the pastas are where they shine!   Chicken (3.5/5 stars): a bit on the drier side, but great flavor that made up for it. A little bit spicy!  Overall, a nice option in the Grand Canal Shoppes. The food won't blow you away, but it's good, and the ambiance will blow you alway.",

To begin with, when we wanted to order drinks,  our waiter told us (3) times, \"Please give me a few minutes.\"   Right there we should've gotten up and left.  When we finally got our drink order in, I watched our drinks sit at the service bar for 10  minutes.   I almost walked over to the bar and picked them up myself.    When we finally got the food order in I proceeded to watch our server joke around by the kitchen pick up counter, meanwhile we were all in need of new drinks.  Needless to say, it was a repeat of what I said in the previous paragraph.  When the food came, it was just ok, nothing spectacular.  Being an \"off the boat\" Italian  family, dinner is always followed by Dessert / Espresso.    But given our waiter's service throughout the meal, we chose to just leave and get the rest at a different place.   It's a shame for the restaurant... (7) desserts and Espresso sure can pad a check.  We just didn't want to give this restaurant any more money, so we got the check and left.  Keep in mind this was the service that we had, I did watch other tables get much better service than we did,   I forget the name of our waiter, but he was an older gentleman who did not wear one of the tan jackets that the other servers were wearing..  For the first time in years, I tipped below 15%.     I can say that we never will come back to this restaurant, we'll try somewhere else on the square.  This restaurant was full, so I'm sure that they don't even care if a bad review is posted.",

You will simply be paying an arm and a leg just because it's located in the Venetian. Not worth it. You will get better food if you decide to cook it yourself.",

We had a room above St. Mark's Square that comfortably fit 60 people, the service was fantastic, the food was outstanding, and the price was extremely reasonable. We brought in our own cake (actually a cupcake tower) so we substituted the dessert for the cake-cutting fee.  We looked all over the strip for a place that would comfortably fit our group without killing our pocket book while delivering a meal that people would remember, and we hit a homerun - we felt extremely lucky, because as everyone knows the strip can be very over-hyped and over-priced.",

    "text": "AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.  Came here for a late dinner around 10pm the last time I was in Las Vegas and while the ambiance was relatively pleasant, I was thoroughly appalled by the overpriced food they were serving and the incredibly slow (non) service.  If you're forced to eat here, definitely sit outside on the patio. People raving about the ambiance like it is was God's gift to men--wait, what? Have you never seen the sky before? It was simply a restaurant with patio seating with views of the artificial sky dome of the Venetian Hotel plaza. If you wanted a nice meal under the \"sky\", chewing a piece of gum outside on the Strip would be more enjoyable.  Also, descriptions of this place being classy is REALLY pushing some low standards.  Service was nonexistent and glasses were left unfilled for 30+ minutes. They only took our drink orders at the beginning of the meal and never asked again. One should never be left thirsty in Las Vegas.  The food here is on par with a Chili's (ew). We ordered Caprese, Beef Carpaccio, and a charcuterie plate.  Our waiter messed up the order and gave us a Calamari (the calamari wasn't awful). The meats in the charcuterie assortment were sodium-loaded and of very low quality and for the first time in my life, I left unfinished slices of proscuitto on the plate.  I ordered gnocchi, and it was not good--pasta texture was soggy and overcooked, served lukewarm, bolognese sauce tasted like it came out of a can leftover from WWII. Tried some of my friend's pizza...wish I hadn't.  Ordered hazelnut gelato for dessert--too sweet and literally the smallest portion of gelato I have ever received. How did we go from large, crass serving portions to Canaletto's sad attempt at molecular gastronomy dessert plating?  You'd be better off saving your time and money by having a satisfying quick meal at the food court if you're hungry in the Venetian.",

Service : I got my appetizer before I even got a glass of water and bread...The server was in a bad mood before we even got to our table, so it felt like we were annoying her even more by sitting in her section and eating there.  The host - told me to wait, than 30 sec later he is smiling again telling me exact same thing he told me 30 sec ago, and then he says, \"oh, wait, didn't I speak to you already\". I was like yeah, man, less than a  minute ago! Pull yourself together.  Food: it was good, the salad tasted yummy, warm octopus salad was delicious... My girlfriend ordered an entree - scallops. The scallops were huge, juicy and fresh, but not seasoned at all.  Overall the freshness of food and the quality is good, but the service is letting the place down. I understand they are super busy, but I am not paying money for frustration, I am paying for a pleasant experience, and I hope that management will figure things out.",

The soup was tasty and the pizza was delicious. I do love the arugula with prosciutto and Parmesan combination. The service was great and our waiter did try with our wedding menu.

I was raving about this place before, and actually have been meaning to come back. Now I wish I didn't come back and just kept that sweet memory.  What we ordered: *CAPESANTE CON RISO DI VENERE (Grilled sea scallops with black Venere rice salad of fennel, radicchio, micro arugula, crispy lemon slices and parsley - $27.59) - Loved the scallops, but the venere rice salad ruined it for me. It was sooo citrusy and sour that it almost kinda starts to burn your lips. The rice was also hard to eat. It was either the rice that was at the bottom of the pan and was over cooked, or the rice wasn't cooked enough. It became difficult for me to enjoy the food. I don't know if that kind of rice was suppose to be like that, but I've eaten plenty of rice in my life, and I don't think it should be like that. I told our server about my rice sitch... and she gladly brought me back better batch of that rice which was much better.  *LINGUINE ALLA BURANELLA (Thin flat pasta with mussels, prawns, scallops and clams seasoned with tomatoes, crushed red pepper, garlic and trebbiano wine - $25.99) - What my bf ordered... I tried it and it was mostly pasta. It didn't have that much flavor, and was pretty bland. The seafood, however, was perfectly cooked, so at least that was good.  I guess this restaurant has a different people cooking the seafood and their carbs? Because the carbs (which makes up most of the dish) is really off while the seafood is on point. This is one of those restaurants that didn't really justify the price of the food. I've had better Italian food for a fraction of their price.  **Their restrooms are upstairs. Why? I don't know. It also doesn't seem like it's being maintained properly because the door for the stall wasn't in good condition. I mean it's not dirty per se, but it's starting to look run-down.",

This room overlooked the balcony and the Venetian lake / bridge / cobble-stoned floor. The restaurant set up was beautiful and extremely classy. Perfect for a date night!  CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5 stars - I felt like a princess! They were like little ninjas, weaving in and out between the diners, cleaning up and serving without any disruption! - They were the most gracious, the most polite, and the most attentive waiters EVER.  - We had a team of around 7 waiters constantly going around, checking up on everyone, refilling water, folding napkins, etc. - They cleaned up every every single course and it was refreshing to not have to flag people down in the middle of your conversations.  FOOD: 4 stars - It was pretty dericious. I apologize to my fellow Yelpers out there for forgetting which course I chose from the menu (our group had a preset course menu), but I know I ordered the salad (which was very well seasoned and very flavorful) and ordered the steak which unfortunately was a little on the dry side (I asked for Medium Rare).  OVERALL:   This is a lovely date area (def. romantic), great for people watching especially if you sit outside (also great for making passerbys jealous of your food), and if you're a stickler for customer service like me.. this is definitely the place to go.",

My wife and I showed up after our families, since we were taking pictures on the grounds, and the moment we showed our families informed us that a live cockroach was found on the dining table.  The server grabbed it with a glass and plate and proceeded as if nothing happened. I then asked to speak to the manger.   We worked out that is discount would be applied to our bill. Sadly, this was not the end of it. We went 35 minutes unattended and the table was broken which kept hitting the bride's father on his legs. Once more I asked to speak to the manager, by this time my wife was extremely sad, upset, and embarrassed.  To top it off the food was sub-par. My steak was not cooked as I order it and my wife's fish was not cleaned properly.  The apple crepe dessert was soggy and thick.    Overall, this was a horrible way to spend our wedding reception.",

There is seating \"outside\" and inside the restaurant.    Finally decided to give it a try, but I wish I had had something more memorable. Portion sizes are also real small for the high prices!  I'm very picky with food and my boyfriend loved it, so take that into mind as you read my review!  First of all, the ambience is undeniably beautiful and intimate.  You will get bread and olive oil with balsamic, as is customary in Italian restaurants.  Not only will you get sourdough, but also a couple of tiny bread balls- one with rosemary and one with sesame seeds.  I ordered the Risotto with Asparagus, Chicken, and Saffron $20 I don't know what it was but it tasted so darn cheesy! I mean, SUPER CHEESY as though it had been saturated with that Mac n Cheese powder cheese. Boyfriend loved it, but he has no other risotto to compare it too! Also, the pieces of chicken were super small and the asparagus was even split in two to make it seem as if there was more...  Boyfriend ordered the Chicken Cannelloni $18  Consisted of 2 pasta rolls of about 6 inches in length and 6 in full diameter.  They were ALRIGHT, nothing to get excited about.  Again, boyfriend loved them.  For my taste, they were average cannelloni that you could get at any other italian restaurant.  Finally, we chared the Tiramisu $8. Another disappointment for me.  The piece was pretty small and not as layered as other Tiramisu I've had.  Mostly, it was creme and hardly other layers of flavor.  Yes, you guessed it, boyfriend loved it.  Overall, it was an \"ok\" place. Although my bf loved the food, he didn't like the small portions for the high prices so we WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!",

    "text": "Went there around 2:00pm for lunch. It was totally full outdoor (patio) so we just sat inside of the restaurant. Actually it was not bad at all to sit inside because the decor was very elegant and romantic. The service was very great. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. The menu had a variety of items and you should easy to find what you like.   We had ordered:   Salads: INSALATA DI PERE (Arugula, radicchio, frisee, grilled pears, grapes, Belgian endive, crumbled blue cheese, toasted pecans, pomegranate dressing) - Very FRESH and very good combination of fruits and veggie  INSALATA BALSAMICO (Organic baby lettuce, carrots, balsamic vinaigrette) - Again, very fresh but no special for this salad   Main Dish: CANNELLONI DI POLLO (Large pasta tubes filled with rotisserie chicken, mushrooms, organic spinach, sundried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella; bechamel and tomato sauces) - good portion and great flavor but slightly salty to me  GRIGLIATA DI PESCE CON POLENTA (Grilled Chinook salmon, seabass, prawns and sea scallops with fresh lemon and herb sauce; served with grilled polenta and sauteed vegetables) - All seafood were well cooked and tasty.   The bill was $85 with tip. I thought this was very reasonable for a restaurant in the Venetian........ Overall, a pleasant environment with good food...would definitely recommend to anyone!",

It is in a lovely spot...smack in the middle of the faux St. Marco's Square near the gondolas...so you DO get that \"I feel like I'm in Italy\" thing while siting under the painted ceiling.  However, with that said...we just went for drinks.  It said to seat yourself so we did just that but then it took quite awhile to just get a damn menu. Then we ordered, and yes, it could be our fault for the choice...a Chianti.  It was just so-so.  The service was overly slow on all fronts....  I think it would probably \"do\" if in a pinch but I think there are far better places to try in the Venetian...namely Zeffirino.",

    "text": "The fam and I ate lunch at Canaletto our first day in Vegas.  We had a table \"outside\", which is actually inside, but is made to appear as if you are in San Marco square (minus the dirty pigeons, per my sister).    As mentioned by a previous Yelper, Canaletto is owned by Il Fornaio, so if you like them, you should enjoy Canaletto.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed their meals.  I ordered the vermicelli con marinara.  Unfortunately, I was wearing a cream colored cami and my navy Max Studio dress.  Marinara and light colored tops do not mix.  Since long strands of pasta are notorious sauce splashers I asked the waiter if I could sub a rigatoni or penne pasta instead.  No problem he informed me.  That is one of the signs of a restaurant that makes customer service a priority.  Stars for you Canaletto!  One of my sisters had artichokes stuffed with crab and the other one had a risotto with shrimp.  Brother had pizza margherita.  Mom and dad each ordered some sort of meat, but I don't recall specifics.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  One of the really fun things about this restaurant, particularly eating on the patio, is the people watching.  You can see some mighty interesting people traipsing around the square.  Makes for some interesting lunch time topics of discussion.",

It's great to get a table outside, but take a stroll inside and see what they've done with the place.  The upstairs section would be a great place to throw a party.  We were walking through The Venetian and decided to grab a bite here.  Unfortunately, I probably would have liked dinner here better.  The pizzas and pastas coming out looked excellent, but I just wasn't that hungry.  I got the carpaccio and a beer.  Peroni is always good on tap and I get Stella all the time, but other than that there isn't much to choose from.  I was a little dissatisfied with the carpaccio.  Splotches of it would stick to the plate.  I don't know if it was cut too thin or there wasn't enough oil, but it should slide off my plate and into my mouth, not stick to it like it were sitting under a hot lamp.  Now, I don't think it was, but that's the only way I can seem to describe it.  Saying that, I wouldn't order the carpaccio again, but I would go back and try some of those tasty looking pizzas I saw going to tables.",

    "text": "I came here right after the BMG show.  One good thing about the place is that it's open late and has a lot of seating.  It's also in a prime/beautiful location right smack in the middle of St. Marks square.  I've been to Postrio on a previous trip (which shares these same benefits) but I enjoyed the food much more at Canaletto.  I didn't read yelp reviews before I sat down (but now I have Yelp Mobile ;) on my blackberry) but I can say I would have shared similar thoughts after seeing the menu.  Besides the risotto (which I tend to consistently order at restaurants) none of their other items reached out to me.  If they did, they were the seafood items at a pretty heavy cost.  I was looking for a decent-priced and relaxing meal...not an exorbitant crustacean one :).  Maybe it was just my luck, but when the waitress informed us of the special of the day I let out a sigh of relief.  Not only did it sound great (shrimp+crab+bass+halibut pasta) but it was as cheap as the lowest priced dish on the normal menu.  Both this and the risotto were fantastic!    It's weird giving a thumbs up, and using the random \"special of the day\" as an argument for it.  However, after the taste and preparation of my meal, I had a lot more faith that any of their other items on the menu would be just as well-prepared and thought out.  I uploaded pics of both my entrees!",

You can get a gorgeous table \"outside\" in the square.  Its great for people watching and you'll sometimes get random entertainment too.  Everything is beautiful in the Venetian.

I also enjoy my prosecco (they have several kinds). One of the chief complaints of other reviewers is how expensive this restaurant is- it's Las Vegas; everything is expensive here. That being said, I felt their prices were actually rather comparatively decent for a nice dinner with great atmosphere and live music.",

We were seated promptly at an outside table on the plaza.  Our waiter Alexande was GREAT.  He was very attentive, personable, gave some great recommendations and overall one of the best waiters I have had.  We ordered a cheese plate.  Good selection of cheeses, with grapes, pears and jalapeno jelly.  Just enough for the two of us.  I ordered the Osso Bucco with risotto and we also ordered the tagliatelle with pork.  The osso bucco was very tender and had good flavor. I would have liked a little more flavor in the sauce but overall it was good.  The risotto was excellent.  It was saffron and served properly.  The tagliatelle was good. Excellent flavors.    Good size portions for each serving.  Different breads served with olive oil. All were fresh.  This restaurant is at the Venetian but is run by the IL Fornailo restaurant chain.  I think this is a cut above the basic restaurant chain in service and product.  We will be back.  This isn't a cheap restaurant at 40.00 pp really not that bad for the quality.",
