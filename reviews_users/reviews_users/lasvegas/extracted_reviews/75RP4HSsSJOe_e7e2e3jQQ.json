I've noticed some reviews say that service is slow but I haven't noticed that at all. Indoor and outdoor seating. Lots of options on the menu. All of their juices are made fresh.I usually start with the green go juice. Portion sizes are big, at least for me. So far I've had veggie eggs benny, chilaquiles, veggie bagel sandwich (huge!) and good ole steak and eggs. Loved them all. Just writing this review has me craving the place.",

My wife had the chilaquiles. They had a spicy rub,   not that saucey. French roast coffee, they brought out sand timers to distinguish how bold you wanted it. That's different. We sat down immediately but the place looked pretty full, food came out quickly. I woukd come back. Welcome to Hendo!",

The hostess and cashier were super nice and seemed genuinely happy that we were there on a busy Sunday morning. Our waitress, Maria, did a great job explaining the menu and providing attentive service. Our food came out hot and delicious. I tried pancakes and eggs and was really surprised how delicious the food was. It was a conservative first try but I feel if they get that right other options are worth checking out next time. My wife really enjoyed the salmon and Lox omelet. I highly recommend this spot for a nice breakfast experience.",

I ordered the Rise & Shine Burrito, which was amazing. I love large portions of food and this burrito satisfied that. It came covered in Ranchero and Green sauce (half and half). The burrito came with refried beans, which I asked to substitute for something else. For whatever reason the waitress said that wasn't possible, so I just went along with the beans. Ultimately, the refried beans were actually really good too! I also ordered a coffee, and the staff made sure that the coffee cup never became empty.   The one thing that bothered me was that the menu had A LOT going on, but that's just me being picky.",

    "text": "The begining of my adventure:  As I live near this location I always said, \" I want to try that place.\" Unfortunately I am not a morning person so for me to drag myself out from under my down comforter and at least make an attempt to not look like a swamp demon is though to say the least. But after fighting my desire to stay in bed I made my way to this place. I wish I had know the staff wore PJs as their work attire I would have stayed in mine, minus the eye boogers and snarled hair. I thought, hey this is kind of cool and fun. The decor reminded me of something that might come from a childs cartoon or dream after eating something from Alice in wonderland, with bright and vibrant umbrellas and giant paper butterflies floating about.   The menu and drink:  Ok, onto the food because that is what this place specializes in. The menu has in my opinion your usual breakfast staples. Nothing over the top like cherry jubilee bubble gum fizzy wizzy pop pop pancakes. One thing that did catch my eye was something called pot o' bread. After struggling to keep my eyes open, as I mentioned I am not a morning person, I settled on the corned beef hash and a side of pot o' bread and an apple juice. The OJ is fresh pressed, however the apple juice was nothing special just your overly sugared apple juice. At least there was nothing floating in it.  The Pot o' bread:   The pot o' bread came out before my meal. When I saw the bread I said to myself, \" well isn't that just the cutest little loaf of bread.\" It comes out in a white porcelain cup just big enough for an infant, with the bread billowing out of the top, dusted with powdered sugar. On the side is a vat of maple cream cheese glaze. Ok, maybe not a vat but hey one can wish. If you decide to go with this choice be prepared to feel like you are eating a warm cinnamon cloud dipped in ooey gooey sweet goodness. I wish I could have ordered a case of these and taken them home with me. The pot o' bread that gets 5 stars.   The main feast:  Onto the corned beef hash. I have eaten a truck load of this stuff in my life time so I would say I am hash connoisseur. As our waiter brings it out I can see an angelic beam of light shinning down on my hash. Ok, not really but I was just hungry and couldn't wait to eat. He finally gets to our table after what seems like forever and gives me my hash. I am thinking its going to be a pile of chopped corned beef and hearty potatoes all fried to perfection with a soft yolked fried egg waiting to be split open and let that golden yolk flood the hash. Que the whoomp whoomp sound track...... Like a kid who was expecting the latest and greatest mom's and grandma's knocking each other out toy for Christmas only to tear off the paper and see the my mom waited to long and bought the knock off version from a man only known as I know a guy, in the back alley, I hung my head and I think a felt a single tear roll down my cheek. It turned out to be some sort of faint I left my barbie hairbrush out in the sun for 2 weeks after playing with outside after mom told me no lukewarmish semi fried what I think was beef and some hard potato remnants that came from the corner of the grill. It was topped off with a mangled orange slice and one very the chef feel asleep at the grill and tried to scrape the burnt pieces off the edges and hope no one notices egg.   The Service:   The service was not spectacular award winning tell Gordon Ramsey he needs to drop everything and come see this place but it also wasn't tell Gordon Ramsey he needs to come take care of business because it sucks either. It was just there. I give the place 3 glittery twinkling stars only because of the pot o' bread and the giant flouncy butterflies.",

My husband had the fancy steak house omelette he said the seasoning was good on the steak, but it was fatty. I had the Veggie Benny not a fan. It had everything I love on it and yet it was terrible. I think the balsamic drizzle killed it for me and I love balsamic. The guacamole they slather on the bottom had gone passed its prime and was pretty flavorless. The best part of breakfast was the cup of bread. Yet for 47.00 with tip is quite a bit for a breakfast of this caliber. Probably will not be back it's a shame because it is pretty close to our house.",

I understand you might be cleaning up areas not being used to get a jump on closing, but the person wiped down the booth I was sitting in. Took the condiments off my table and practically threw them back at me. She did not put them back in the condiment holder on the table. The waitress did when she returned to my table. The person cleaning seemed to be angry about something and was taking it out on the restaurant and by default the customers. Good food- good waitress, but one person can change the atmosphere of the place",

We had an amazing time and we will definitely be back. Thank you again Mike!",

They have upside down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling which is pretty unique and indicative of a street in England.  I ordered a lot so I could try a bit of everything:    I got the cup of bread which is essentially a cinnamon roll cooked in a coffee cup with cream cheese frosting to dip.  It was good but needed more cinnamon and I would've preferred a glaze to dip.  I got a side of biscuits and gravy which again was good but too pricey for what it was.  Also, my biscuit was hard as a rock, luckily they replaced it for free.  My main dish was the chilaquiles which was very tasty.  Chips, with ranchero sauce, cheese, refried beans, salsa, sour cream, two eggs, and avocado.    They have so many different types of dishes, many that are not seen elsewhere that I really want to try.  Guess I'll have to go back!",

Today I Finally had the chance to try Rise & Shine out and i was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The Decor was bright and beautiful and the place looked clean. One of the 1st things that really stood out was the server's all dressed in their Pajamas, sooo adorable! As indecisive as I am, Sharon our waiter was extremely kind and helpful, she even made great menu suggestions. Their Chicken n Waffles were Amazing, Juicy lean chicken Breast and Not greasy at all, the Waffles were light n fresh! My husband enjoyed his French toast and Turkey kielbasa and their coffee was actually pretty good, not the cheap stuff thank God! ...the only constructive criticism I had was that their kids meals were way too tiny for the price, which didn't even include their drink. But the food overall was delicious and Sharon was an Excellent host, her infectious smile and attitude will definitely bring us back plus as a New Yorker I really want to try their bacon egg n cheese bagel lol Thanks Rise & Shine!",

My other half needed a proper brekkie so we held out,  but had fed the kids just 30 min earlier since they couldn't wait.  Dane was our server and he walked us through the menu telling us his favorite things to eat. We got the carne asada chilaquiles (my go to happy place) and my other half got a stack of  buttermilk pancakes and Dane switched it up for us and got it with toasted pecans and bananas. (hubby's fave for brekkie)  Our kids got FOMO and even though they had a full meal 30 min before they also got a stack or pancakes and french toast (which they make with Texas toast) it was amazing and we topped it off with mimosas!  Dane was so personable and such a gracious host that we decided to come back again this morning! The kids ate red velvet pancakes, buttermilk pancakes and me and my other half had the chilaquiles (again), steak And eggs, and also cinnamon crunchy french toast. We got to say hi to our buddy Dane again and it was such a great stop over before we hit the road back to LA   Thanks Dane ! We will be back to eat here the next time we visit.",

The ribeye steak is as good as it looks in the pictures! Biscuits were good but the gravy is some of the best gravy I have ever had! And those hashbrowns, so flavorful! The Ambiance is casual but inviting with lots of natural light with lots of windows. I am so excited to go back and try more things on the menu! Thanks for making me a fan of breakfast!

It came with so much Worcester sauce that I could hardly see the eggs.  I'm sure that neither the server nor the cook has ever eaten Eggs Benedict plastered like this.  I tasted nothing but the sauce.  To those who don't eat Worcester sauce:  a little goes a long way.    Note to management: If you want to offer Worcester sauce, put a bottle on the table and let the customer help himself.  In short: good food (I suppose) ruined.",

We stopped in around noon on a Saturday and to our surprise there was no wait for a table. Our waitress was over quickly to greet us and take our orders. She was friendly and continued to check in us during our meal.  The Pot of Bread sounded intriguing so we shared that to start. It is a combination of a cinnamon roll and a roll. The combination of a sweet and a non-sweet is perfect. The frosting to go on top was delicious.   I had the Spice-Rubbed Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles. This was very good. Their presentation was like a deconstructed chilaquiles and while I wasn't a fan of the presentation I did love the flavor of everything. The steak had a great seasoning and enough fat to additionally flavor the steak. The chips also had a nice seasoning and the perfect amount of cheese coating them.   My husband as always ordered the better of the two entrees, the Southern Style Chicken Fried NY Steak. The fried steak was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. The gravy on top was delicious. I would definitely order this entree on a return visit.",

Food was ok but on the heavy side and the experience was not great from the moment we walked in until we walked out. From the moment we walked in, I asked if we could be seated in a booth (three adults and two toddlers and plenty of open booths). The answer was no and then the guy mumbled something - no idea what. Whatever, we sat at a table - not a huge deal but I wished the request was handled in a nicer way. Once we sat down and we ordered I asked for the kids' menu egg to be soft boiled egg. He repeated it and then he brought back (and he even presented it as such) - \"a hard boiled egg\". Then, I ordered an iced latte in a to go cup. It was brought out in a regular glass (I put it myself in the kid's cup, so I can take it with me). I had the veggie eggs Benedict - it was not bad but very heavy. It comes with potatoes and a lot of sauces on top and while it was ok, I would not eat it again. We came here because of the reviews and because I wanted to try something new but will most likely not return. The pro is that the place is nice and has a small outside patio but it is not worth it because of the bad experience.",

Today I had the Cup O'Bread and the Rib Eye Steak Chilaquiles and boy, was it tasty. I asked for a medium rare steak and did they deliver! The steak was juicy and nicely charred on the outside, giving it an authentic smokey taste. Though this may have been the main part of the dish, the ranchero chips may have slightly outperformed the steak. Their chips are housemade and seasoned with a multitude of spices, with a basis that seems to be paprika and cayenne pepper. The chips laid on a bed of refried beans and was topped with eggs (any style you choose), avocado, cheddar and cotija cheese. The chips were still crunchy and was served with a side of sour cream and salsa. I recommend getting overeasy eggs, so when you break the yolk it adds an extra sauce to your chips.  Overall a very wonderful experience and I can't wait to come back!",

After 5 minutes of not being approached by a server, I asked a hostess for a cup of coffee and to find my server. Server appeared a few minutes later with my cup of coffee. He apologized and said they were short handed and they are still trying to work the kinks out of a new restaurant.   Servers are  inexperienced and move very slow. If I could offer one tip for the servers that would be to treat your section as one big table vs. 4 or 5 individual tables. Stop making a trip into the kitchen each time you leave a table. Stop, make eye contact with your customers to see if they need anything before disappearing.  I found the coffee and the food to be much better than the service. Hash browns were crisp on the outside and flavorful inside. The ham steak was thick and juicy. The eggs cooked perfectly. I opted for the cup of bread instead of my usual wheat toast. The cup of bread is a bland cinnamon roll with frosting on the side. I think this would be good as an appetizer but didn't care eating it with my breakfast.   The prices here are crazy expensive for a neighborhood breakfast restaurant. My bill worked out to be $20/person with tip.   I would come back here for the food, but not very often because of the service and the price.",

Unsure about the waitresses look/theme of them wearing pajamas and looking as if they literally rolled out of bed and came to work. At first before i realized that was the theme, I told my husband how shabby our waitresses looked and she should've atleast put the effort in to making her ponytail neater instead of messy and lopsided. It wasnt until i paid attention to the other waitresses it dawned on me, I'm sorry.  Won't go back but happy I went. That's the only way you'll find out for yourself if you like a place or not.",

Cinnamon roll with the best cream cheese sauce..mmmm. Husband ordered the rib eye and eggs. He said that it's the way a rib eye should be made...I wanted to reach over for a bite. Didn't have to cause I ordered a steak omelette that was great. Such good steak. I was nervous cause other menu items were so generous with portions but mine was a tad smaller and just perfect!",

I'm not a syrup junkie so taste is important when it comes to my waffles.  The bacon was super greasy and tad bit chewy. No go on the bacon. The country fried steak was pretty impressive. HUGE!!!  I usually hate the gravy but to my surprise it was probably the best I've ever had for my CFS! Heck Yeah! Bring it on! The Country fried steak was crunchy, well cook and seasoned.  Bonus for me was that the gravy was on the side. I hate globs of gravy all over my steak. So there it is. Go eat, order CFS, get your gravy on the side and leave the bacon alone.. 3 stars/ I'll try again earlier in the day...",

    "text": "I have visited Rise and Shine on many occasions, I live clear in the North East Las Vegas and I am willing to make the long drive to this location in Henderson for a great breakfast. Their menu selection has something for everyone in your party (assuming you don't have strict limitations like kosher, vegan, paleo and all that stuff that I fortunately don't care about. although I did see some stuff that may fit some of the healthy needs) they have sweet dishes, savory dishes. My personal choice for this trip was the corned beef hash with a pot of bread...if you haven't had their pot of bread I highly recommend it! The rest of my party all had something a bit different, Chilaquiles, some amazing looking steak bagel benedict and a dish that I can't recall because I was too busy stuffing my face and enjoying a nice morning cup of coffee. I will say that on this visit it seemed like my coffee was a bit cooler than I would like, but the service from Maria made it ok, she topped our drinks off frequently and made sure we had everything we needed on this visit. The prices are a bit above average for a sit down breakfast and lunch place, expect to pay around 14 to 18 per person, but the quality and portion of food makes it a way better choice than just swinging by McDonald's or I-Hop. Price is fair for the food period. If you are looking to have a great breakfast with your significant other or a group of friends, check this place out. The servers are all wearing pajamas, so if you roll in wearing yours, you might get asked for a refill or something :-)   Dishes that I enjoy cinnamon crunch french toast thing Corned beef and hash Steak bagel benedict thing two fisted bagel sandwich  Pot of bread",

Great food, nice folks(employees as well as customers), in a fun casual atmosphere.  Maria served us in her PJs, with attentiveness & positive hospitality! She is easy going, yet professional and got us what we needed for our almost two year old daughter who was on the brink of a meltdown and in that shrieking mode. Thank you, Maria for your patience!! Thank goodness there were crayons and fun little paper menus for her to go crazy on. I don't know why I am always surprised the food is so delicious. It's almost gourmet, but presented in this coffee shop style restaurant. Seriously, the pancakes are fluffy and moist and kind of had a subtle orange flavor to them today, which could've just been from the juice of the fresh orange sliced garnishes. The Maple syrup is served HOT with a side of fluffy real butter. If you're looking for a more low carb meal, then the spinach, chicken & egg white omelette is packed with protein and FLAVOR. Just remember to substitute the breads and potatoes for tomatoes and avocado. Maria and the kitchen are very accommodating. I'm pretty sure the tomatoes were tossed on a pan for two seconds because they were sooo good, just melted in my mouth! The kids menu offers a variety of mini breakfasts, and is seriously a decent amount of food for your little ones!! Mini egg and steak, mini egg and crispy bacon, mini yogurt cereal and fruit, mini waffles etc. Hubby ordered one of their steak Mexican breakfast burritos and he loved it. It was oozing with all kinds of spiced delights. I had a hard time staying away from his side of beans. Whatever is in those is friggn addicting. Oh!! And The Bloody Mary's are da bomb! They decorate them with a whole hard boiled egg, peppers, & olives, which honestly is like a meal in itself! In fact, I can't  wait for the weather to cool down so we can just ditch the car & walk there to indulge in those Mary's without worrying about a designated driver! I wonder how many carbs are in those drinks? I guess if we're walking it doesn't matter as much.  So, is it obvious we'll be back?",

I  had to change my meat because I asked for well done it was red inside of it, I was really wanting steak.... I ended up with sausage eggs and toast, mimosa and a Coke $23.65.

I was looking forward to a chicken wrap, but that whole part of the menu wasn't there. Same with the kids options, if you wanted to eat lunch items, they have only chick fingers and a grilled cheese. I had to buy my daughter a normal burger for like $11, and knowing how big it was, we could've shared. It also took 30 mins minimum for the food to come out. Happy to know it's fresh, but maybe bring kids food out when it's ready?  also they charge $3 for a soda, even for a soda for kids in the kids cup, which is 1/3 the size of my glass. All and all I wasn't super impressed. The food was seasoned well, but I think $45 for me and my two kids is a bit much.",

    "text": "We came here for breakfast, and I'll never forget our experience. And that's far from a compliment. It was an early weekday and the place was empty. There was literally only one other table, party of 2 being served. With all the great reviews I figured we got lucky with our timing (wishful thinking).   We were seated right away. Our waitress, who wasn't serving the other table, came over with the menus and gave us a minute to look at them since we had never eaten here before. Well, that minute turned into about 15 minutes. Maybe some people like a long time to look at the food options, but usually a waitress comes back in a few minutes to get your drink order and then asks if you'd like more time to look at the menu. At the very least, we could have been offered water, but nope. When she finally decided to come back to our table we ordered a coffee, water, and a smoothie. She was in no rush. I don't expect people to go running around, but getting a coffee and water doesn't take 10 minutes. Especially when you're only serving 2 people. Now granted, maybe a nice fresh hot pot of coffee was being made. Nope. The coffee was room temperature, if not cold. We ordered 2 classic breakfasts and then we waited.........and waited, and waited some more. In the meantime, I wondered if she was going to bring the smoothie or bring it with our meals. Roughly after 40 minutes had passed, she brought our food and no smoothie. We've all had a time in life where we forgot something, we're human. I had hoped to get my smoothie an hour ago, but I still thought it would be nice to have with my meal. I nicely asked if she forgot, she said yes, and that she'd bring it right out. In the meantime, I was hungry and started to have my breakfast. I really liked the bacon and...it ended there. The eggs were like anywhere else. Nothing special. Not that I expected special eggs (lol), but since their prices are higher I thought maybe they'd taste a little better or higher quality than somewhere much cheaper and reasonably priced. But they didn't. Now the hash browns. This is a matter of opinion and/or acquired taste. I love hash browns. But...I really wish they specified on the menu that these were not your plain old hash browns. I don't know exactly what was on them but they were strongly seasoned. I'm sure there are people who love them, I'm just not one of them. I thought I was getting just plain old hash browns. So after sitting there for about 25 minutes, talking and picking at my food, I accepted the fact that I was never going to get my smoothie. She never came over for coffee or water refills, so I didn't even have a chance to ask a second time (technically 3rd time, 2nd reminder).   As we are finished with our meal and waiting for the check, she comes and brings the smoothie. I nicely asked if I could have a straw, and she rolled her eyes and had a real attitude about it. Seriously??? I've been sitting here for an 1 hr and 30 minutes waiting for a smoothie that I nicely asked twice for and you're pissed off because I \"nicely\" asked for a straw, which by the way was in her apron pocket! It's not like she had to make the 15 ft walk to the kitchen to get one. To top it all off the smoothie wasn't cold, it was melted, and clearly had been sitting out this entire time. I was pissed, and unlike her, I had a reason to be.   We didn't want to wait 30 minutes for our check so we asked for ours, and a to-go cup for the smoothie. It was expensive and I wanted to ask for a refund, but we also didn't want to deal with her anymore and I thought maybe I could chill it at home. Within 5 minutes she brings our check and no to-go cup for the smoothie. What a joke. We got up, paid the bill, and as I was walking out the door she came over and said she would go get my cup. Shockingly, she actually brought it.   I think it's obvious why I'll never come back, and highly discourage anyone from coming here.",

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The food is pretty good here. The upside-down umbrellas are cute. The space is cozy, a kinda \"we're starting up an independent coffee house on a budget\" cozy. But your visit here, depending upon what you pick from the menu, will inflict significant pain where you sit on your wallet.   There's two things missing from the Rise & Shine website. (1) A listing for this location (idk why) and (2) all the prices from the menu. Yep, management deleted the actual prices and replaced them with $$$ signs. That proves management knows full-well that their pricing comes on way, way too strong.  Example: A slab of breakfast ham & eggs, $13.25. Houston, we gotta problem. That same plate at Village Pub is about $9. And over at the Longhorn Casino it's just $5. Now I know those three venues are vastly different, but you have to admit that a slab-of-ham-and-eggs will NOT be that much different at those three venues. I mean that's a plate that is going to be tough to screw-up ... or lift-up.   Another example: Bagel sandwiches. Turkey+avocado bagel sandwich or chicken+egg+bacon bagel sandwich. That sort of bagel sandwich. They come in at the $13 price range, with a side of fries. I saw two of them presented to the booth next to mine, and they do look large & scrumptious. But you know this is a breakfast joint, and when I think about the whopping tasty breakfast bagels they serve up at Einstein Bros. for about $6, even though they probably aren't going to be as yummy as these, I still just have to say \"no\" to the $13 option here at Rise & Shine.  The venue itself, as I said, cozy. The colorful upside-down umbrellas hanging down from the ceiling, a nice touch. It looks as though they are mounted to fan motor posts, so maybe they can be powered up to spin, idk. But if you look closely, management has really made a very minimal investment in decor here. One big painted wall with some huge raw-wood letters that spell out \"Shine All Day!\" Another wall has a cut-out silhouette of a cow sitting on an egg. Oh, and they do this other cutie-thingie here where the wait staff is dressed in PJs. Cozy, cute, but nothing that screams out \"of course the ham & eggs are gonna be $13 bucks here.\" The background music is relaxing, best described as \"the soft side of 1970s rock.\"   In terms of food, customers apparently seriously favor three items here: the rib-eye & eggs plate, (that comes with) 'cup-o-bread' and the house Bloody Mary. I had 2 1/2 of them. My Bloody Mary was virgin, also sans any Bloody seasoning. What people out in the real world call a tall, thin glass of Clamato juice. So it was only $1.75 instead of $9.00. That's OK with me. I hit it with some salt, pepper and hot sauce outa the caddy. Besides, I love Clamato juice; I'll take a Bloody Caesar over a Bloody Mary any day. And I like finishing breakfast with an extra $7.25 in my pocket (that I didn't drop on a shot of Svedka).  The cup-o-bread is quite yummy. Basically it's a hot, freshly-baked, mini-mini-cinnamon roll (baked inside a little tea-cup), served with a side of melted, heated cream cheese icing to use for dipping. Again, yummy/tasty, but you know it also seemed to taste a lot like that Pillsbury pop-the-edge-of-the-can-on-the-counter-and-bake-it-up stuff. Hmmm, I wonder if ...   The rib-eye (& eggs) was a welcome surprise. No wonder it's popular. Check the pictures. This is not one of those bargain-breakfast \"well, technically, I guess you can call this a steak\" steaks. I mean this is a honest-to-goodness real & generous cut of rib-eye. Not \"the best rib-eye on Earth\" rib-eye. But very real, very tasty, nicely marbled, nicely charcoal-ed rib-eye. As it should be, since the plate, with a side of tasty/crispy grilled hash browns, was $16.50. And--believe it or not--the third egg was an upsell, bringing the plate to $18.50. Ouch! We're not far off there, price-wise, from an entry-level rib-eye DINNER.  RECOMMENDATION: A cup of their Lavazza coffee + your laptop = a relaxing morning hour spent here. While doing that, you can look over the menu and decide cautiously upon your next move.",

    "text": "This is an adorable little cafe to have breakfast with your family. It has more family intimate feel then going to one of the chain breakfast places. The service was phenomenal. The servers were polite & had funny banter and wore the most adorable pajamas. The food was excellent it came out quickly and they constantly refilled my coffee. The prices were medium range and the food was definitely worth it. I would recommend this over many other breakfast places in green valley. The decor inside was adorable and it had brightly colored  umbrella's hanging from the ceiling and the restaurant had lots of color and details.  Definitely a five-star meal for me.",

It was unlike any coffee drink I've had before. And the s'mores waffle was so darn yummy. I also found it cute all the servers were in their PJs. If I could, I would put this place in my pocket and bring it home with me to North Carolina!!!",

Needless to say, we were not disappointed!! We started with their fresh juice, coffee, late, and a Bloody Mary. Fresh juice was really good and reasonably priced. Coffee and late were both good but nothing over the top. Bloody Mary was unique and had a great balance of acid sweetness and alcohol. for starters we tried their Cup of Bread and I definitely think this is a MUST try. It's everything a cinnamon roll should be, but better.   For actual breakfast we had a burrito, cinnamon French toast, red velvet pancakes, and eggs Benedict. Burrito was massive and full of eggs meat and hash. Benedict was savory and rich with a balsamic glaze that definitely balanced out the fattiness. Cinnamon French toast was crunchy on the outside and chewy and tender on the inside. Their syrup is served hot and has a great flavor to it. Red velvet pancakes  were really sweet but not overpowering. They had chocolate chips cooked in which added an extra layer to them.   Without a doubt a place we will be going back to!",

Seriously, I think it's one of the best breakfast places I've ever been to, but.......BUT the service is awful. The first time we went we just thought that the server was a little flustered because it so busy. But the second time we got a different server. They were also busy this time but the servers are just not friendly. I've been a server and you're not supposed to make people feel like they're a nuisance. I'd really like to go here again when we come back but I think last time may have been the straw that broke the camel's back for the hubby. Oh well! But very good food though!",

Water takes about another 10-15 minutes to arrive to the table. Which is more understandable if its busy. But as of right now there is 2 servers covering 5 tables.. Watched my cup of bread sit in the kitchen for 10 minutes had to ask 2 times for it to be brought out. I was close to going back and grabbing it myself. I also came very close to making a scene in the restaurant cause this is a joke. The location in Southern Highlands is great, I eat there all the time but this location is gonna go under if someone doesn't get over here to the Valle Verde location and do something about this. Waitresses have attitudes and are on their own time. Will not spend another dollar at this location. Goto southern highlands. Completely different restaurant. Not trying to bash this place, I want the owners to see this review and do something about it. I never write reviews and I am definitely not the type to write bad reviews even if I am pissed off. I dont like bashing companies but when you are in a service based industry and your service is that far off something needs to be voiced. Food rating 7/10",

I'll admit my hash browns were undercooked, but now that I know how they come I will just tell them well done next time. And I will definitely be back. Make sure you check out the t-shirts and socks.

Most meals come with a bread in a cup, basically a delicious tiny warm cinnamon roll ! And they also offer some fresh juice choices like watermelon, which is a refreshing addition along side orange juice. I ordered some child silver dollar pancakes for my daughter and my husband and I ended up eating the majority of them, the flavor was so good. I expected a standard plain pancake but they is a flavoring I can't place in them that made them good by themselves. The portions are also a nice size, enough to eat the whole plate if you very hungry but not too much to feel like a pig (I don't really like left over breakfast food). I'd say the service made me minus a star. It was a little slow and also impersonal; know one looked very happy to be working there, or checked on us during the meal.",

You definitely won two new customers for life! Really recommend this place to everyone.",

Staff uniforms are pajamas - very cute and different.  Food is delicious. Went with the basics - eggs and pancakes. The syrup is real, heated with cinnamon sticks - a unique twist but not overpowering, just a hint. I use these basics to judge - if they can't make a good pancake, not worth the bother. Not True here - light, fluffy and delicious. Also like they offer full and half stacks!  Next visit will be more adventurous.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Only minor complaint - coffee drinkers don't get a saucer, so have to improvise for my spoon.",

I had to call for a manager and they brought out a teen who apologized and tried to give me a $5 coupon to come back. I told them to keep it since we won't be coming back. Don't come to this place. They don't care about customers. They only care about profits. Really disappointed. Everyone else around us didn't have a problem. Just us. Go somewhere else. This place sucks",

However we waited about 30 minutes for our food while the table, who had just sat down 10 minutes prior, received their food quickly and before us. I ordered a steak omelette -after all it is called a steak and egg place. The steak was not edible. It was extremely fatty, yet impossible to chew. I tried two different sections and had my husband try it also. We both had to spit it out. Sharon, again, was fabulous and very apologetic. She sent the manager, Gilbert, over.  I own my own business. I understand that sometimes anything that can go wrong does. That was the case with us. However Gilbert wanted to lecture me on the different types of steak. He also told me that sometimes entrees come out sooner than other entrees, to try and explain why the table next to us got served immediately and why we had a 30 minute wait. He said he would take the price of the steak off of the entree and only charge me for an omelette. He never offered me a new steak. He also was not apologetic. So for a the horrific experience today he gave me a whopping $3 off. Obviously it was offensive and any good manager would have gone above and beyond!  Based on Gilbert's treatment of us, we will never go back!  However if you choose to go task for Sharon!",

Located in a corner of a little strip mall, interior is fun, bright, and colorful. Servers are in PJ's (must be nice!) LOL. Cool upside down umbrellas on the ceilings. They sell some pretty fun merch like shirts with witty sayings, socks and different kinds of stress balls.   Let's talk food... First of all, you can't leave this place without trying their CUP-O-BREAD. Tastes like a cross of a cinnabon with a brioche bun, baked into a cup with cream cheese dipping sauce. I made the mistake of sharing. I would've devoured one... or two by myself. Steak and eggs, yes. Perfectly charred and seasoned on the outside but medium rare goodness on the inside. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The chicken and waffles was okay. Big enough to split between two. Forgot what the name of the vegetarian everything bagel sandwich was, but it was good. The loco moco with spam... so delicious and big enough to split.   Service was exceptional. Special thanks to our server, Maria. She took good care of us. Thank you! We will definitely be back when we're in the area.",

Rise & Shine Service:  Greeted as soon as I entered and told it would be 5 minutes before I was seated and it was exactly that.  Mike was my server and was a rock star in a packed house on a Sunday morning.  My coffee was kept fresh as if I was the only patron in the restaurant.  Fantastic. Definitely a time for a #tipthebillchallenge  Rise & Shine cuisine:  The menu is packed with some great options and I went with the XTRA Protein & Egg White omelette.  Delicously packed with protein and flavor: grilled steak, chicken, bacon, cheddar, mushroom, onions spinach and salsa..oh my.  I grabbed some wheat toast for carbs and paired with some freshly brewed bottomless coffee this was a win.  Rise & Shine ambiance:  Friendly staff attitudes adorned the dining area along with pastel colored walls and flowered wallpaper area. Bright colored inverted umbrellas hang from the ceiling.  Positive slogans adorn the walls and they sell some equally bright clothing that by the entrance.  Rise & Shine is only a couple of miles away and I'm kind of shocked I've never stopped by before.  Great service, flavorful and interesting breakfast dishes will get me back. I'm definitely eyeing that Loco Moco, but that's another yelp tale. Good Morning! =)",

First I suggest you look at the menu before you come because it can be a bit overwhelming! We started off with a specialty appetizer (avocado toast) and freshly squeezed orange juice because I had no idea what to order! After about 20 minutes and a tremendous amount of help from MICHAEL I finally decided to go with steak chilaquiles and a side of green tea. The steak was cooked to PERFECTION and absolutely blew my mind.. I felt like I bit into at 4 star steak house steak. Extremely impressive My friend ordered the Avo-veggie-Benedict and that as well was wonderful.  From the delicious and tasty food to Michael's outstanding customer service and extensive knowledge on the food menu pertaining to any questions we had, in just blown away. Will definitely be returning and with more friends and family next time! Thank you Michael!!",

We ordered the chilaquiles and I was craving Hawaiian so I ordered their island themed plate (just wish they had the macaroni salad). Food was good though and staff very friendly!",

This location is the best one I have been to in regards to the service which was top notch the entire time we was in the resturant.

The balsamic glaze that is on the Ham & Eggs Benedict ruined it I felt. I love balsamic & put it on many things but what they used had a bite to it like pepper. Back of my throat burned after a couple of bites & throughout the meal.  Service was great from the waiter but the busboy that kept trying to take our plates that contained food & we were still eating which was annoying. Giving it 3 stars as there are other items on the menu I wouldn't mind trying & over all experience was ok.",

The food didn't come out for almost an hour, and when I complained, the staff gave me a $5 certificate -- rather than comping the meal. Today, I decided to give it one last chance. I ordered a \"small\" portion:  turkey sandwich with cheese. Out came a lame pre-packed couple of turkey slices with a couple of slices of cold swiss cheeses. All served on \"Wonder Bread-style\" bread. When I asked for a slice of lettuce and a tomato, it was brought to me. But the substitute of fruit for fries (I'm a healthy eater) cost an additional $2.95. The fruit portion was pathetic. I will NEVER return. Bad food. Uncaring owner.",

I came in with a party of four, place was busy was told wait time about 10-15 minutes. I saw bigger parties waiting. A waitress cleaned a table suited for 4, not a couples not for 5 or 6, for 4. So I thought I'm next after waiting the suggested time. The. This older guy with a much younger female come in and a very old looking waitress kind of gave them a wink and waved them in. Mind you this couple was at the desk waiting to check in and the old waitress had them skip when the young hostess wasn't looking. I was annoyed because they took the table for 4 and now I had to wait, i suppose twice as long. I'm sure they didn 't miss me but I will never give them my business. They should either teach their waitresses to respect all customers or replace them with some who will. Also be mindful that we as customers are are expecting to have the best treatment, earn your tip.",

I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to chicken/country fried steak and will judge a restaurant based solely on their execution of my favorite dish. I figure that a place with steak in their name had better nail it so I order it and anxiously await. Service time was a bit slow but I'll give it a pass as place was pretty swamped. Plate arrived and presentation was nice with country gravy on the side. I was very pleased with my choice, perfectly cooked with a nice batter and high quality piece of steak. Nothing worse than paying top dollar for some frozen disc of questionable meat from a bulk pack bought at Costco. Wife enjoyed her avocado veggie whatever..

They play country music, which to me is mind boggling since the number one response to \"what music do you listen to?\" is \"anything but country\". The service is mediocre I went an hour before closing and the server made me feel like I was inconveniencing her for having to do her job. The interior is surprisingly tawdry as well, it's like they substituted everything in a Greek restaurant for even tackier decor. Plus they sell a bunch of crap that could only be categorized as \"Things grandmas buy their nephews after going to Church but before they have brunch\".

Tried their avocado Benedict and a classic steak and egg dish. And Sharon treated us (including our dog) like royalty on the patio.  She made sure we had a table with maximum sun exposure, thoroughly answered all of our first timer menu questions, and made time for small talk.  We'd come back here first before going to the other 500 Henderson brunch restaurants again.",

The service was odd...as we were leaving, one of the servers practically RAN US OVER trying to get to the kitchen.

    "text": "Found a new breakfast and lunch spot on Yelp and it delivers in service and flavor! I'm all for pancakes and waffles-the usual, but sometimes I'm craving for a hearty breakfast without all the floury carbs. Rise and Shine centers their breakfast go-to with steak and eggs, but they have all the classics favorites too. Our server, Maria, was a ray of sunshine friendliness. Even the host, was cheerful when seating us.  I ordered a coffee with cream and it was smooth and strong. I had to order their popular rib eye with eggs and potato hash. Just a note, Maria did let me know the hash brown has green onions in it, but you can request your hash plain if you like. I don't mind green onions in general, but next time I think I will have my hash plain, but if you do want it more savory, go with the green onions. The rib eye steak was tender and well seasoned with pepper and not too much salt. The poached eggs were perfectly runny inside and flavorful. The Build Your Own Burger was definitely home made and was delicious. It wasn't densely packed together like frozen patties and tasted fresh. They also serve alcohol here if you want to get your brunch on with something bubbly. I also was wowed by the bread in a cup. It's like the center of a cinnamon roll in a little cup with a cream cheese frosting dipping sauce. It was steaming when I tore into it. Sometimes a little flour carb is ok and when it's this good, it's a must try.  All in all, this place is a hit for me. The service is excellent and the food can back it up. The place is very clean and I think it has enough charm to be a local favorite. Definitely will be back and highly recommend.",

I was with my son, who is very much into coloring as well as eating crayons .. anyway, We sat there for about 10 mins before our server came over to us, in pajamas, which I thought was actually pretty cool.. I asked about the freshly pressed juices, they had a strawberry & watermelon combo which she let me sample before getting a full glass, the sample was tasty, and I ordered a glass and a coffee as well, the glass of that juice was not delicious, after a few sips i couldn't drink any more, it tasted kinda off.. i had ordered regular coffee and they didn't want to brew any more so she got me a french press instead which i was excited to try but it was disgusting, that's not her fault at all, so i got a cappuccino instead which was delicious..   my son was coloring on his kids menu, then he proceeded to color the window.. you know what, I'm that a-hole parent, i let my son do it BUT I made sure the crayon didn't screw up the window,  it wiped clean and before we left I made sure both windows in my booth area were cleaned of any crayon mess.. At one point, my son turned away from the window onto the wood with his crayon and before I could get up to stop him myself, my server took my sons hand and proceeded to remove the crayons from his hand.. he was not happy but seriously, under no circumstances should anyone touch another persons child without permission from the mom/dad/parent.. THAT IS NOT OK! I know what my son was doing, and i take full responsibility for his actions, especially IF he would have damaged something.. I did not share my feelings with the server as I was not going to make a scene, but once the crayons were out of the picture and he was calmed down , we ordered food which was good, not amazing but good.. Carne Asada Burrito and a Kids breakfast with eggs, bacon & pancakes..   She dropped the bill for my convenience which I appreciated, i had money out and had asked her if I pay up front or at the table and she said up front, so i planned on paying as I was leaving.. several minutes go by as my son is still eating and I noticed it was about 2:30 and people were bringing in signs from outside that were advertisements for this restaurant.. my server sees me still at the table with my son and she comes and takes my money to the front for me off the table, I stated \"uh I'm about to leave..\" but then she brought me my change and said \"have a nice day\"..  Long story short, DONT TOUCH SOMEONES KID WITHOUT PERMISSION..",

Soon after drink orders were taken and we were given a few minuted to browse the menu. The menu was mostly like the original with a few exceptions, so we had a good idea what we wanted. I ordered the chicken fried steak and Josie had the french toast. My Chicken fried steak was of course quite good. However, it did have a different flavor than what I remember and it may be the batter. Either way i was quite delicious and I ordered more gravy because I can never have too much. The french toast was as usually quite delicious and seasoned and cooked well. The staff as usual was attentive and on top of our beverages. I might add that Josie had the hot chocolate and it was visually stunning as well as tasty. Thank you for eating at Rise & Shine (Henderson). Yes, we will return and I am sure it will be as great as it always is. So, go and get some good breakfast. you won't regret it.",

The steak came out burnt and was told it is only the coating on the steak. It does not say on the menu they put a blackened coating on the steak, nor does the server tell you when you order it. The service has also gone down hill, had to ask for coffee refills and never brought me honey after asking twice. The Manager was less than sympathetic and really did not seem to care that customers were not satisfied.    Don't know what happened but the table next to me must have had a similar experience as they got an left shortly after their food was delivered.",

    "text": "Came for breakfast on NYE and had the chilaquiles and biscuits and gravy with eggs OM and a fruit cup. Breakfast is okay enough that I wouldn't refuse to come if someone requested to meet here for breakfast, but it's not my favorite spot. It's better than a few other places in the valley, but I have a few complaints:  1. The prices don't match the portions. Why is the biscuits and gravy $11.75 when the biscuits are smaller than my palm? This is a fairly cheap dish to make and serve and you can get bigger, similar if not better quality biscuits almost anywhere for less. Peg's for example serves B&G bigger than my palm for $7.99.   2. Service is bad. Maybe our waitress was having a bad day, but I had to remind her about bringing coffee and never got a refill-- it wasn't a busy morning and we sat down after all of her other tables had their food.We didn't see her again until she came to drop off the bill. My husband pointed out that they had to bus their own tables for some reason, but why isn't every waitress offering coffee warm-ups/refills to nearby tables to mitigate issues like this?  I used to be a waitress, so I can extend some understanding but... c'mon.   3. Stupid problems. There are too many people congregating by the door/cash register between needing to pay and needing to sit. It's a clusterfuck.",

I've been wearing the consequences of being a foodie so I was trying to be (somewhat) healthy in my choice. I had the AvoVeggie-N-Eggs Benedict and it was just as decadent as a red velvet pancake. So dang yum. A whole mashed avocado on a perfectly crisp English toast with grilled tomato and spinach with the obligatory poached eggs and hollandaise. Came with a side of hash browns I probably should have asked to substitute for fruit or something. I'm new to this healthy thing",

I always assumed it was one of those bland breakfast places with humongous portions that my parents would love so I have put off trying it until now. I  mean they sell socks and other random items by the register and the servers wear pajamas so it kinda reminds me of a tourist trap you'd stop by during a road trip.   BUT the food was actually very tasty! I mean the portions are huge so I was right about that. We got the chicken and waffles and a breakfast burrito. The chicken and waffles were so good! The chicken was more flat and similar to a chicken fried steak but didn't really taste heavy. The burrito was pretty standard but I'd still order it if I was craving a breakfast burrito. Good coffee choices too! I like that you can order iced coffee. Our server was super nice and checked on us a few times.",

The staff are very friendly but I still had some trouble getting our waitress' attention for simple requests like more water or napkins. The menu is pretty good with a wide variety to choose from. The food on the other hand does not match the prices. The taste of the dishes we ordered didn't even come close to the somewhat expensive prices. I've had way better at mom and pop or old school diners for way less expensive. You could argue quality or bring up non GMO or whatever with me all day but I don't go to restaurants to pay for bland foods when I can make Those at home for way less.",

    "text": "After driving by this place a few dozen times decided to stop by for brunch today and I am very glad I did.   The place is very whimsical. Umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Gorgeous metal sculptures of their chicken and cow themed concept. The print on the booths added another fun pop of color.   The menu was robust and a little overwhelming. I was torn between a few things and took our waitresses recommendation for the chorizo and steak burrito. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. Made our first visit a pleasant one.   My burrito was very ok, but had potential to be so much better. The overpowering flavor in the ranchero sauce was too much. There was so much chili-powder (90% sure it was chili powder but maybe paprika) that it dominated my palate. Everything I ate after that sauce tasted like chili powder. I'm also pretty sure I just got the steak burrito since I didn't get any chorizo. If I did it was unnoticeable visibly and tasteless. The burrito as a whole was also really have and the flavor profile was depthless. There was almost so much going on that everything got lost. I couldn't pick out a single ingredient in that burrito when I took a bit.   Trying to figure out if my burrito was bad or if everything was bad I separated it out to try each ingredient. The steak was delicious, cooked perfectly. The beans were ok, but similarly had too much of whatever was in the rancher sauce. Eggs were eggs. I realized that the ranchero sauce was just so over-powering that everything in the burrito was overcome. It didn't allow any of the ingredients to shine which is unfortunate because the steak was good. I decided if I went back, I'd avoid the ranchero sauce and opt for the Rib Eye and eggs. Would be worth the extra $2 to get the steak and eggs without whatever else was going on in that burrito.  My wife got a burger and it looked delicious. I didn't think I'd point out shoe string fries as being a plus, but they were seasoned perfectly. Had the same restraint in the ranchero sauce showed, I imagine it being way better.   Service was good and for the price the portions were appropriate. I'm going to go back and try something else, because I left wanting more. Just more of something else.",

    "text": "Last week, my husband and I found ourselves over near Green Valley Ranch, and VERY hungry pretty early in the morning.  We pulled up our trusty Yelp apps, and found Rise and Shine.  We're big fans of the original Rise and Shine location, so we opted to come here to try this one out.  We had the place to ourselves for most of the time we were there.  It is a bright, open spot, with plenty of seating.   Diamond was our server, and she was very polite, and was able to answer any questions we might have, including some odd ones.  We ordered:   Cup of bread:  This...I remembered being different at the other location.  I thought it was served with butter, but it was served with a cinnamon icing sauce instead, and dusted with powdered sugar.  Good, but not what I remembered.   Smoked Salmon Benedict:  This is, quite possibly, the best benedict I've ever had, and I eat a LOT of bennys.  The eggs were poached perfectly, the hollandaise was delicious, and the smoked salmon was a wonderful addition.  This was served with hash browns and they were perfect as well:  crispy but not burned, and very flavorful. Steak and eggs:  My husband orders this every time we go to breakfast, no matter where it is.  He ordered 2 eggs over medium, and a medium rare steak.  The steak was definitely more on the medium/medium well side, which was extremely disappointing, however, it was seasoned VERY well, so we both were still able to enjoy it.  His has browns were a little anemic looking, no crispiness on top at all.    All in all, this was a better than average visit.  I'd really love to see the steak cooked to the requested temperature next time, but everything else was quite good.  I anticipate that we will be back again soon.",

    "text": "We are always on the look out for a good breakfast spot. This is located in a very busy strip mall but we had no problem finding parking close. When you walk in your eyes instantly go to the ceiling where they have brightly colored umbrellas with flowers on them opened up and facing downward. Some of them are on spinners. Very cute idea. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in their pj's. Yet another cute concept! The menu seemed very healthy. Some gluten-free options, fresh squeezed juices, etc. They are supposed to be known for their steak and eggs.  I am not a huge fan of steak and eggs so I ordered the Banana Foster flake pancakes with 2 eggs and a banger sausage. Banger sausage...interesting just one came with the meal. It isn't your normal greasy sausage..interesting.. it is actually kind of hard to describe but it was really tasty. Now for the pancakes...delicious. I am not a syrup eater so for me the pancakes were just right. Enough sweetness and the crunch from the corn flakes was perfect...a griddled  banana was on top along with whipped cream and nuts. My man loves country fried steak and eggs...he said it was really good. It is made with a NY strip steak. He ordered a side of a biscuit and gravy and he said the gravy they used on the biscuit was different than on the steak...it did look different, not as much sausage and thinner. He preferred the gravy on the biscuit. But he said all in all it was a good meal. I had the fresh squeezed watermelon and strawberry juice. Mmmm mmmm mmmm. I am a sucker for anything watermelon though! :)  We hit the restaurant at the perfect time because after we sat the place filled up!!!  We will definitely be going back.",

Southern Highlands location - Once seated, it took close to more that 15 mins to get our water,  30 mins for the server to take our order and another hour to get our food. We've seen people get seated, eat and leave while we were seated. Totally unacceptable.  We spoke with the manager but did nothing about it.  Henderson Location - Thought I'd try this new location out. I ordered for pickup. Low and behold, I had a very long piece of hair in my food. We called and spoke with the manager and requested for a refund but we needed to go back to the location. Once at the location, the manager was no where to be found.  Got the refund from the host but WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  I DO NOT RECOMMMEND GOING TO THIS PLACE. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. I HAVE HAD BETTER SERVICE AT DENNY'S.",

The ribeye has great seasoning, but isn't always the right temp. I like a medium steak and have gotten it both very rare and well done here. If it's done right, it's pretty good.   The hash browns are different and good.   The chicken and waffles are okay. Nothing special. Ask for buffalo sauce (if you like a little spice.)  The French toast is delicious. Crunchy and good.   I do not recommend the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits are tough and the gravy is bland.   With a few changes, it could be a 4 star place.",

    "text": "Rise and shine... Because when YOU shine bright, you give permission for others to shine their inner light too!   My 4 year old, 13 month old and my sister met here for breakfast one hot Vegas morning.   Waking in, I caught eye of one waitress, and thought to myself, wow, those look like super casual comfy pants to wear to work. Then I saw the another waitress and noticed they all were wearing pajamas! Cute idea, it's like we stepped into their home and they are fixin' up breakfast for us.   When you come here, it's essential to order the Pot of Bread. It's bread baked in a small coffee cup. The top portion is cinnamon bread. And it comes with a side of sweetness to dip the bread into. My 4 year old daughter thought this was so much fun!!   We ordered the steak and eggs, after all, that's what the restaurant is named after! The steak is rubbed with a coffee seasoning. I'm not a coffee drinker, but OMG, this was delicious! So much flavor! My sister and I split the steak, enough for two, but sensible enough for one if you have a big appetite. I also substituted the potatoes for fruit.   My sister, who is classic in her own right, had a classic Belgian Waffle. I snuck a bite, and it was sooo delicious. And they ONLY have REAL MAPLE SYRUP. I really appreciate that!! I do not like high fructose cheap pancake syrup, so when they brought out a bottle of real maple syrup, I was sold! Great waffle. I'll be coming back and ordering that for myself next time.   My daughter had the 1+2+3=6. Clever name. It's 1 egg. 2 bacon. 3 silver dollar pancakes. We substituted the bacon for fruit. The silver dollar pancakes were on the larger size, very good.   The high chair for my 13 month old was a good height for the table.   We will be back and will also take out of town guests here because it's great food, some unique menu items and fun experience. Totally recommend!",

I had the homemade hash and eggs it had nice chunks of corned beef in it that was very flavorful. The interior of the restaurant was very cute reminded me of summertime on a farm. The waiting staff was pleasant the only disappointment was that omelette it was a spinach mushroom cheese some sort of protein with avocado on top and my girlfriend said she thinks it was supposed to have a salsa but it definitely did not have the salsa or at least it was not enough to taste.",

    "text": "Heading out of Las Vegas for that drive back to So Cal, and wanted to grab something to eat after a quick stop at the outlet stores.  Due to my bad judgement in distance we ended up in Henderson which was a good 15-20 minutes away in the opposite direction of where we were going, but figured since we were already there, lets give it a try. We were not disappointed.  On any Sunday in So Cal finding a breakfast place without a wait is always a challenge.  Rise and Shine is located in a strip mall with plenty of parking and while the restaurant was full, we were seated right away.  I had already done some homework and knew i wanted the French Press coffee and the Pot of Bread.  Both are fantastic and worth a try if you go.  The coffee comes with a neat little egg timer for different strengths of brew which is a nice touch.  The Pot of Bread comes out steaming hot and when you slather the cream cheese spread on, its heavenly.  My companion decided on the homemade Corned Beef Hash and eggs, and while she prefers canned Corned Beef, nope i don't know why, this is the first homemade Corned Beef that she said she would come back for.  I had to have the Chilaquiles since that was big on the Yelpers list, and of course had it with the Rib Eye.  If you are hungry this is the dish, the portion is huge, and full of flavor.  If your travel plans allow you to swing through Henderson for breakfast, Rise and Shine will not disappoint.",

We were seated quickly but it took a hot second for our server to touch the table.  However, once she did, we had great service from her.  I will say I'm glad we didn't have to wait because the area in front of the register can get quite crowded.  We did have to wait to pay and it was awkward.   The food was good (as it is at the other locations).  It's not gonna knock your socks off but it's not bad either.  This is a solid place where you can get a consistently good meal.  I will say if you're not expecting the steak to be heavily seasoned and charred, this is your warning.  It is.  That's just how they do it here and you either like it or you don't.  Luckily for me I do, so yum yum!!!  Great place to make your regular breakfast spot!",

I was initially taken aback by the variety of socks they have for sale. I didn't purchase any, but they were a fun mix of witty and artsy.  Once we were seated, I immediately took notice of the decor. They have spinning umbrellas hanging from the ceiling! The decor was very cheerful. We were then greeted by our attentive and pajama-clad server.  The menu was expansive--there's really something for everyone. We decided on splitting the vegetarian eggs Benedict and red velvet pancakes. What a treat! I really enjoyed both entrees, with emphasis on the cream cheese \"syrup\" that accompanied the pancakes. Both portions were generous and I was overly-full when we left.  Overall, I really liked this spot. The parking lot is a bit hectic, but that's not their fault. Henderson is a bit of a drive for me, but I look forward to coming here again.",

It was a perfect combination. My buddy had his daughter and she had the waffles which she loved. He had the eggs with corned beef hash, which he said was great.  I enjoyed the meal so much that I came back this weekend to give it another try. Plus I wanted to write a review because I love to see local restaurants succeed. The lox omelette has capers, onions and it sits on a bed of spinach which is just a wonderful combination. Another bonus, they have a outdoor eating area that is dog friendly.",

    "text": "I went for the steak and eggs, but they didn't both shine.  Rise & Shine - A Steak & Egg Place has expanded enough that you can call them a local chain. They started out elsewhere but opened this Henderson outpost almost a year and a half ago. Since then, they've clearly enjoyed success because it was quite packed when I came here for Saturday morning breakfast.  I was fortunate enough that my friends had arrived a little earlier and secured a table for us. It took a little while to get our orders in and such because it was crowded, but the food come out quickly enough and the check can be settled at the register near the entrance.  I had \"The Ultimate\" ($17.50, or $18.50 if you add one egg), aka the Ribeye Steak & Egg Breakfast. It had a bread option which was sent out to our table first. I went with the catchily named \"Cup-O-Bread,\" a roll which was half cinnamon and half not-so-sweet. It was quite soft and moist throughout, perhaps a bit too much so at the very bottom. I also enjoyed the cream cheese sauce, which was served as a dippable side. It wasn't sickly sweet, thankfully.  I was very glad when my food first arrived, but the steak itself was visually and texturally not as I'd expected. It looked to be cooked rare rather than medium rare, and parts of the outside looked too charred, an observation which later tasting confirmed. Most of the steak wasn't as tender as I'd hoped for. It may be a notch above discount late night steak & eggs, but it should be at least two tiers higher given the price.  The rest of the dish was solid. The hash browns had enough salt and crunch. The poached eggs were quite impressive, aside from the residual poaching water in the serving vessels. The whites were soft, and the yolks were super runny. You can count me as a fan of the eggs at least.  I may come back to Rise & Shine, but it won't be for the ribeye. I heard that the country fried steak at my table was really good, and there are plenty of other options including waffles, benedicts, burritos, chilaquiles, juices, and alcoholic beverages. It's just too bad that they didn't succeed with their namesake.",

Had the waffle, opt for no powdered sugar and no whipped cream because I'm a whore for butter and their warm maple syrup *insert drool emoji* Added the 2 eggs and bacon for $3.50 and it did not disappoint...got my eggs scrambled with cheddar cheese...eggs were perfect and not dry. Love love love.   I always get the resh squeezed orange juice because, it's just that awesome and something I can't pass up.   My brother got the two fisted 3 little pigs bagel & egg sandwich and couldn't finish it because it was so big. He opted for the fresh fruit platter in lieu of hash browns and shared it since it was a lot.   He got the michelada with a tajin straw and he would not stop raving about delicious it was!!!  I will be back again and again!!",

The service is friendly and prompt.  I ordered a iced caramel coffee with coconut milk which came with whipped cream which I wish they told me about but I still drank it and it was ok.  I ordered the fancy steakhouse omelette which comes with a side of hash browns and a bread option but since I'm trying to limit my carbs they were able to replace the sides with an avocado and fruit.  I like that the omelet came with good size pieces of steak that were perfectly cooked and a pretty good portion! I'd definitely come back!",

    "text": "My family loved this place. I took a rating pole and it was 5,5,5,1. I was the 1. Living with carnivores I love finding places that can accommodate both carnivores and vegans. When I saw their menu with a ton of vegetarian options I had high hopes. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. I ordered the chilaquiles with beans only, no cheese. They advised me their refried beans had animal fat. I was kind of shocked. If you have tons of vegetarian options, it would be a simple and smart choice to make your beans vegetarian too. I could have ordered many things on the menu with the beans. Instead I was left with a side of hash browns and avocado, which is the token sad vegan food at a breakfast place.   On a positive note my husband and son loved their Ultimate steak and egg breakfast. They have you cut into the steak when it comes to the table to make sure it's just right. My oldest got his with the cup of bread, which is half biscuit dough mixed with cinnamon roll, twisted and baked in a mug. Served with a side of cream cheese icing for dunking.  My son said it was good, and really liked the cream cheese based icing.  My little guy had the Philly  cheese steak. He was a little sad it didn't come in an egg sandwich form, but built his own using his toast  The servers were friendly, and all dressed in pajamas. They sell cute socks here, we got some with Spam on them. The decor is nice, and it was in a nice location with easy parking. Overall we would come back, I think I would just eat before hand.   A note to the owner. Subbing vegan refried beans would satisfy so many people and open up a lot of your menu.  There are a lot of families who are carnivore/vegan combined and it's never fun to be the person at the table eating either a dry bagel, or plain hash browns. Your chilaquiles could easily be made totally vegan and probably become a WOW menu item if advertised right. Another easy option would be to keep your refried beans and offer a plain black bean.",

The first time we went our server kept disappearing and never came to check back on us. Had to ask for water multiple times.  Second time they dropped off an iced coffee in a tall glass with no straws. I had to flag down another server to get one.  The food took over 45 mins to come out and bc of that the manager (I think he was the manager) came and apologized and said he would take off our beverages for us.  We got the check and the drinks were still on there. By now we just wanted to leave so we didn't say anything and went up to the cashier. Our bill was $51ish and she said our total was $70ish.  We asked to check and told her there are some mimosas on there that wasn't ours.  She insisted it was our tab.  The manager came by and we had to tell him and he said sorry and took off the alcohol but still didn't take off our coffee he promised.  Again, beyond annoyed at this point and now running late to our soccer game bc we didn't realize breakfast for a party of 3 (2 adults and 1 child) would take 2 hours.  Like I said, both times we came to this location the food was great but service is not up to par.  Unfortunately we will not be coming back.",

Ex: we got the salmon and bacon bagel, we don't eat meat so we asked to substitute more salmon if we don't get bacon. She said we couldn't do that. I asked if we could sub for avocado instead and she said that's not an option either, we would have to get it on the side for an extra cost. Most food places offer substitutes if you don't eat meat. I work in the food industry and we don't charge extra for replacing meat with avocado? :-)",

We were worried about the size of the pancakes so our server let us know we could get a half order.  That's great because we didn't even finish the half order!  I had the banana pecan and Frosted Flakes pancakes and hubby had the regular old fashion pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs and bacon.  I really enjoyed the combination of bananas, Frosted Flakes and pecans and the fact that they serve warm maple syrup.  The issue for both of us is that the pancakes were dry/overcooked.  Now that's better than being undercooked as extra syrup can help with a dry pancake.  The eggs were overcooked as well.  Bacon was good.    We got the French press which was pretty good.  It was a dark medium roast.    We would come again if we're in the area because based on the reviews, we suspect the chef just had an off day.",

We have eaten there several times now and have not been disappointed.   There is something for every palate on the menu from voracious meat eater to vegan.   Service is excellent. Today Maria was a star holding down the fort almost single handedly and taking good care of our 3 person table.  The menu is extensive and full of tasty choices.  I've eaten the Salmon Bagel (egg, spinach, salmon, cream cheese, capers, onion on The Works bagel) with outrageous french fries.  We ordered watermelon strawberry juice - squeezed fresh. Pancakes that melted in your mouth. Benedict that sat ontop of a hunk of perfectly cooked thick and juicy steak.   Service is attentive, engaged, courteous and funny as the waiters wear their favorite pajamas taking and delivering one's orders.  The seating is comfortable and the decor is light and happy feeling.  Shirts and other merchandise that will bring a smile to your face is available for sale as well.   Rise & Shine has become one of our \"go-to\" breakfast and brunch restaurants.   It is hidden away in a small \"strip mall\" area, but well worth discovering.  We commend Rise & Shine to you - you won't be disappointed.",

It's not even corned beef.  It was bacon hash and not a single piece of corned beef.  It was ok but definitely not what I expected.    Eggs ordered over medium.  Came out over hard. And the toast?   It was ok, but I will never understand sending toast out with hard butter on the side.   We asked for them to soften it, however the toast wasn't hot enough to melt it.  Seriously?   I will stick with Mary's Hash House for my hash.  And no, not the over rated Hash House a Go Go.",

    "text": "I'm going to start out by saying that I've been to the Southern Highlands location probably a dozen times, and love it.  Yesterday my friend and I were out in Henderson, and decided to stop  because he had been to this one before, and enjoyed the loco moco that they don't serve at the SH location.  I ordered an egg white omelet with chicken sausage, mushrooms and onions, and he ordered the loco moco. I received my \"cup o' bread\" rather quickly, and just like SH, it was fantastic, and thank goodness because that's pretty much when I stopped eating.   Our food arrived, and I went to put some Tabasco sauce on my eggs. Big mistake! You know how you do things out of force of habit? Well, I foolishly turned the bottle upside down, only to find out the hard way that they had removed the stopper that regulates the pour, resulting in about 3 tablespoons of hot sauce dumped on my omelet. I started to soak it up with napkins, both on top of the omelet, and underneath. figured it would be fine now, so preceded to eat. After a few bites, I lost my appetite. Even after using napkins, there was an absurd amount of butter at the bottom of the plate, and in the omelet itself. I love butter just as much as the next person, but this was a disgusting amount. The other part that disturbs me is that generally when an order for just egg whites is placed, the kitchen usually knows that the person is trying to go the healthier route and doesn't want their food soaked in half a stick of butter (heck, they even have a healthier section on their menu with egg whites listed as the primary options). I finally ended up just picking out some mushrooms and sausage, and quit.  My friend was struggling with his meal too. He asked me if something was wrong, and I told him it was just soaked in butter, he said his was as well, and that he was getting a little nauseous from it.  Our waiter came by about 30 seconds after we first received our food and said, \"I know it just got here but is everything ok?\" we foolishly said yes prior to even trying anything. When he returned about 10 minutes later, he didn't even ask if something was wrong considering our food hadn't been touched, he just refilled my friend's drink, and we asked for the check. For a regular brewed coffee, a soda, egg white omelet and loco moco, we ended up with a $35 bill (without tip). We left our 90% uneaten food on the table, paid up front and left.   Needless to say, I will stick with the SH location from here on out, but honestly, I'm so mad that I wasted $41 including the tip for a meal I didn't even eat, that I might not be going back to that one for a long time either.",

Had the lox and cream cheese omelet which was a surprise since I wasn't expecting all the extras in it, capers, spinach, onion and I had avocado instead of potatoes which has never been an option in any breakfast spot I've gone to unless you pay extra for it. You'll have to try the cinnamon roll instead of toast, it has a cup of the frosting on the side to dip it in after its pulled apart out of a tea cup that it's baked in, a yummy pre breakfast treat!! The decor is cheery as there are umbrellas in the ceiling that spin and the wait staff wears pajamas.",

Which is fine I know covering a whole restaurant by yourself is not easy. Brought out the food which was bland and way overpriced! I got a bowl of cereal for my daughter it came with yogurt and fruit it was $6 which wouldn't have been so bad if they didn't charge me $3.50 for an apple juice to go with it. All in all spent $40 for 2 people and a baby :/ will not go back.",

I mean At one time I would have recommend this to everyone I know and now I would recommend it to no one....Who wants a steak that you have to push half of it to the side because they're is so much fat.... Unfortunately their quality has declined immensely but that's only for them to decide what kind of customers they really want...",

First thing i noticed was the cool apparel they were selling which was comical. The waiting staff was dressed in their PJ's,  which I think is great. The place was very clean and the staff was friendly.   Now I went to a steak and egg place so I had to try their specialty which is their ribeye steak and eggs. I have to tell you it was really good, I got my steak medium rare and it tasted amazing. Then you couple it with eggs and hashbrowns, you just can't go wrong. Their Hash browns were very good and different bc they don't season them like a typical breakfast joint does and you can tell they are made with care.   The other interesting food item that came with my meal that they are known for is their \"cup o bread.\" It's like a mini cinabun with a cream syrup that's like a sweet and salty combo that is amazing, it's a must item.   Their omelets are amazing as well, from the ones they have on the menu to your own custom creation. All in all the menu is great bc they have a little bit of everything that they make very well.   Oh yeah and when you go ask to sit in MARIA'S section, she is extremely nice and very friendly.",

I wanted to order the sourdough hamburger which isn't available until 11:30am according to the menu. But Maria said she could ask the cook and he happily made the burger for me. Yum!! It was cooked to perfection and very flavorful. It came with seasoned fries and they were tasty too. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye steak and eggs and he ate every bite. My Mom isn't a very big eater and they have a menu for kids and seniors which has smaller portions. She had the grilled cheese with fruit and ate the whole thing. We all had the best food and excellent service. Even though it was busy here she still made us feel very welcomed and satisfied. I recommend Rise and Shine for delicious food and Maria will take great care of you.",

That food presentation is great aside from the hair that was in my butter and dad went with my waffle. And ordering the freshly squeezed juice the single cups are very skinny as well as when you get the bigger portion it's still only serves two small glasses they're tall and skinny. I was not satisfied with the juice so I ordered an ice coffee which was very bland and tasted like water down coffee. It is served with caramel drizzle and whip cream but it is not sweet whatsoever. I ordered the waffles which I upgraded to have bacon and eggs as well and they forgot to bring those to the table. A friend of mine ordered the steak and eggs the steak was literally raw in the center when he ordered it medium well the outside was burnt which pretty much means it was cooked from frozen to wear by the time the outside burned the inside was not even cooked whatsoever . my other friend order of the Chilaquilas, he was definitely satisfied with them and they looked great they must have Hispanic cooks in the kitchen lol I was not going to leave a review because I did not personally like my experience and really hate to leave bad reviews but the lady stressed us on leaving a review for them so I'm not going to leave a fake review. They charge me $2.95 for some pieces of banana for my waffles and for four of us to get breakfast here pretty much eggs on everybody's plate one steak one waffle one piece of ham and the Hispanic dish our total came out to $97.  Considering only one of us was satisfied with our meal I do not consider it a good breakfast.   Oh yeah they forgot the whip cream and the $2.25 bananas for my waffles",

Super nice and attentive, dressed in the pj uniform, it was not offensive or reflective. He wore large black frame glasses and those big ear lobe rings.  I was impressed how he knew the menu and options so well by heart, and took our order without writing it down. I admit, that always make me nervous, only because I know I could never do it.  He nailed it! He also offered his personal experience with the rib eye end result. I asked for medium rare. He suggested I cut into it to ensure it was to my liking. I took his clue. It was indeed raw inside. He most happily returned and apologized. When he returned, it was perfect.  For me, the plate was enough for 3+ meals. After leftovers, I diced the ribeye up for a pot of chili. Although popular and busy, we were seated immediately and the pace was perfect. We never felt rushed to turn the table.  The coffee, Lavazza, is delicious. The restrooms are clean. The decor is welcoming and warm. This is now on the repeat list.",

    "text": "I really came into this restaurant with an open mind. Considering the name of the place (steak and eggs) and being mostly vegetarian/vegan - I already had my doubts...   However, I gave it a chance because they had promising menu items that just sounded perfect for a late Tuesday morning.   I'd say Rise N' Shine is average and places itself along side known restaurants like Cracked Egg, IHOP, Original Pancake House or Egg Works in good options. For the price, the plate size accommodates well.   That being said, value isn't always in the enormous helpings because it should still look and taste great. Rise N Shine fell short here due to the poorly seasoned and lack of flavors, random arrangements of portions on the plate, as well as how underwhelmed you'll feel at nearly $15.00 average per person pricing.    Let me elaborate...   The poached eggs for the Benedict was very under cooked which is very unappealing. The red onions were stacked and kept in a ring formation giving you overwhelming bites of red onion which completely takes away from the harmonious flavors of hollandaise, capers and lox. :(   The oatmeal is served in a deep large white ramekin which to the average adult may be great, because it keeps the bottom lava hot - but for us parents - this is a disaster as you'll spend several minutes cooling off every bite for even the most advanced toddlers.   The french press in all of its glory was very basic in flavor and could use a better selection of roast to complete the experience.   Overall this place is so-so for kids and really comes across as your sub-par Saturday or Sunday morning and lunch place - which I'm sure has astronomical wait times, as they usually do. Oh and the wait staff is definitely new and needs some practice with sense of urgency and ability to recall orders and average requests from one table to the next.   Largest negative takeaways from that $$ classification will be the lack of parking in this ALWAYS busy location as well as price over value over satisfaction ratio that just isn't hitting high numbers right now.   For the heavy meat eaters or 1200+ calorie seekers, might be most suitable. But for those consciously healthy folks, or parents with large families, you'll find challenges. Solid 3 at best.",

    "text": "Looking for a place to have breakfast after checking out of our VRBO and before dropping BIL off at airport. We originally thought about just grabbing a quick breakfast at the neighboring Starbucks when we spotted this place. Had time enough for a sit down breakfast, but had our pups. Never sure about outdoor patios and if they allow dogs.  After a quick check, we were good to go to their back patio (which only separated from a large Starbucks patio by a gate!) Good thing we had a good amount of time and really were able to just enjoy the patio, weather, and coffee.  While we were seated immediately, the service generally was slow.  But very friendly.  So not sure really how to \"rate\" this.  Usually I have no patience for this kind of slow service, but it worked for us today as we actually had time to kill. Meals were ok, not superb.  But definitely better than anything you can get at Starbucks. Coffee - Lavazza brand - was good! Mimosa also good I had the carne Asada chiliquilles (sp?)  asked for soft scrambled eggs - got em!!! Yummy! The steak was great! The tortillas in roja sauce was sort of \"dry\".  maybe a side of the sauce instead of what looked to be store brand salsa, would be better option. Hubs had the chicken fried steak and hash browns,  the steak was huge.  He liked it and made note of how good the gravy was!  Served on side in what I expect is to keep steak crispy.  Good touch. BIL had the egg white omelette.  He ate the entire plate of goodness! His wheat toast came about 10 minutes after the rest of the breakfast and was cold.  So overall, for what we were looking for, good. Not the kind of \"write home\"experience, but if ever in Henderson again, I'd do breakfast here again",

We stopped by on an early Sunday afternoon for some brunch. It wasn't, fortunately, very busy so we were seated quickly. I'm not sure how we missed the opening of this restaurant. We love their southwest location.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable like their other location. The servers are prompt and friendly, like their other location. Basically, another very nice Rise & Shine location.  We had the meaty egg white omelette and a bagel sandwich of some kind. Both dishes were very tasty.",

The customer service is great but another disappointing thing that happened was we order the ABC breakfast for my 16 Month old baby, instead of meat we wanted a little pinch of fried mushrooms considering a he's a baby and we don't mix dairy and meat together, this was something they wouldn't do unless we wanted to pay extra,.... which we did- but then left me thinking value wise if the mushrooms are more than the meat then what quality of meat are they using here?   Anyway this place is really great in some ways but if the food isn't that good then I don't know if we'll be coming back a third time.",

    "text": "We've been to the other locations before and it never ceases to impress or satisfy our hunger. We decided to try the Henderson location this time around.  Definitely was not disappointed. If you're familiar with the other locations, it's the same menu besides the specialty drinks. Started off with the cup o bread. One of my personal favorites. With a hint of cinnamon it's definitely reminiscent of a homemade cinnamon roll with a sweet and slightly tart and tangy icing that goes perfectly with it. Also started off with a single biscuit. This is where it goes from five stars to four. Biscuit seemed a little W. Not as crisp and as flaky as I remember it from the other locations.  I want to hadn't had the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and hash brown. Grady is very rich, chunks of sausage and I believe him add a decadent taste to the silkiness. I couldn't tell if these biscuits were not as flaky as the one I had previous because it was drowned in the savory gravy. Two eggs over medium cooked perfectly and hashbrowns golden perfection and of course the green onions inside the hashbrowns always add the extra kick. Gave this is Danny five out of five. I added the side of bacon to give it a little bit more of that salty savory taste.  We also had the chilaquilles and went to head and splurged and got the steak at it with it. Basic chips over beans covered in red sauce and we have the eggs scrambled. The sauce poured over the tortilla chips is a simple red sauce, very reminiscent of an enchilada sauce. The beans at the bottom were a bit overcooked and dry. The steak was cooked medium as requested and had a very simplistic salt and pepper taste to it which we love.  Had the French press coffee for a stronger coffee taste. 5.95 for a press that served about a cup and a half each for 2 people.  This location is a tad bit small so you tend to hear everything that goes on. There was a Chef or a cook in the open area where the runners and servers go to pick up the food who we could hear on the phone. Not very professional especially when you're using profanity. But other than that Maria, our server was top notch and make sure we were plenty well taken care of.",

Like their other locations, the cute decor is complete with open umbrellas on the ceiling and wait staff in their jammies.  It's fun and creates a comfortable setting for dining patrons.    Now since it's still fairly new to the area, weekends can get very busy.  But if you have time during the week, you can get a seat immediately.  The hostess staff have all been very quick to greet and get you seated.  The wait staff have also been the same.  The servers I've had have been friendly and attentive.    When I find something I enjoy, I stick with it.  That's why I've had the 3 Little Pigs Bagel a few times. It's definitely a large breakfast sandwich piled with bacon, ham, banger, egg and cheese.  Some of the meats have a distinct smokey flavor that soars.  When you put this on their 'Everything' bagel, it's a complete package.  I've split this sandwich with someone and still walked away full.  Shoestring fries accompany the bagel but you can always get hash browns if you prefer.    I'm happy to have such a close breakfast place.  See you again soon!",

This truly does sound the most plausible! The \"Closed\" sign, lights out, and empty restaurant are a figment of my imagination.  I would leave zero if possible. I love when establishments like wasting your time. I f you advertise that you open at 7, be open!! When we show up at 8 and the \"Closed\" sign is up, I get pissed. Nothing like spending time and gas for a wasted trip. Dear owner,  get your crap together. I have experienced staffing issues at the SH place. Apparently repeat business isn't high on your agenda. Sincerely, a never again customer. I should add this was the Valle Verde location",

    "text": "Complete disappointment. I ordered a salad and from the beginning it looked off, but being in a rush and starving I ate it and asked questions later. My mistake. I was right and the salad was missing ingredients. The waitress was going to bring it on the side but the cook said he put it in my salad already. Thankfully the waitress clearly saw it was missing, but I still felt like I was being accused of lying. They were in fact out of the ingredients needed to complete my salad. I got a whopping two dollars off my $15 salad since I stated I did not want \"cow bucks\" for my next visit. This could have all been avoided if I was informed the ingredients were out from the beginning and I could have ordered something else. The other food was also overpriced and none of it was tasty. Overall a bad experience. Unfortunate for me since I live down the road and love a good breakfast place, but I will not be back.",

But our last time there was not usual and I really hope they do something about it. So we were there on June 5th with our kids and were seating by the window. We sat for awhile and ordered then my daughter noticed a quite a of ants and gnats on the window, not a small amount. We asked to move to another table but no one checked that seat for ants, they actually sat other patrons there  while we love this restaurant we may be making the drive to other locations next time or another breakfast spot near by.",

My wife ordered the avo-veggie and eggs benedict.  This looked scrumptious.  They have fresh juices you can order that they make on the spot.  We ordered the strawberry watermelon juice.  This place serves alcohol, also.  It is hard to find, but the list is on the top right hand corner of the menu.  We decided to order a carafe of the Tokyo Screwdriver, which is orange juice with sake.  The freshly squeezed OJ put this over the top.  This place doesn't take itself too seriously.  All the servers wear pajamas.  It almost makes you feel like you are having breakfast in bed.  Now rise and shine, it is time to eat some breakfast.",

I stopped into rise and shine while completing  an early pick up and and this place is absolutely amazing. During my visit I ordered the parfait which was really good, I had the clover honey, strawberry and granola parfait.   It comes in a milkshake size glass with the granola on the bottom of the glass, then the next layer is fruit and then the next layer is the vanilla yogurt with the clover honey on top of the yogurt.      I also ordered the chicken and waffle.  The waffle came out hot, fresh and flakey.   You could cut the waffle with a fork.  The chicken (one breast) that came with the waffle had a little kick of heat to it.  The chicken was cooked chicken fried steak style, because it did not have the bone in.  Overall, this is a great brunch spot.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Rise & Shine on Flamingo - see review here: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/rise-and-shine-a-steak-and-egg-place-las-vegas-2?hrid=PTIfBk6jjK7gfpVP-qWoUg\">yelp.com/biz/rise-and-sh...</a>.  But this review is for the Rise & Shine location at Valle Verde in Green Valley. I visited here because this location is closer to where I live. I assumed it would be about the same experience as I had at the Flamingo location, but I was wrong.  We (my husband, son, and I) entered at 7:50 am on a Friday morning. It had been open for twenty minutes already, so it's not as though they were scrambling to set up. We waited by the door for a couple of minutes and saw no host, or anyone who worked at the restaurant, to seat us. We saw people dining so we knew we weren't the first customers.   My husband opened the door again to set the chime off. After another couple of minutes of no one coming to seat us he set it off again. I don't like waiting to be acknowledged in a business. Maybe this is a personal hang-up, but I worked hard for the money I'm about to hand over to someone for a service and if I'm not at the VERY least given a prompt \"Good morning, we'll be right with you\", I usually leave. There are plenty of other restaurants that are ready for me.  Just as we were about to leave, a server came from the back area. No good morning. It's so simple to say \"good morning, sorry for the wait\". She asked if we were three and seated us. She took our drink order. My husband asked if their water in the restaurant was filtered. He usually thinks water tastes funny if it's not filtered, so he always asks. He doesn't want to waste a full glass of water he won't drink. She took offense to the question.  She informed us where she came from, people just turned on the tap and drank whatever came out.   I get that she may have been annoyed by the question, possibly it sounded snotty to her, HOWEVER, she could have just said, \"I'll go check\" and once in the back did a major eye-roll and told everyone back there what a difficult table she had...which she didn't. I think it's perfectly fine to have questions about what we're about to be served, including the water.  My husband ordered a bottled water since she didn't know if their watered was filtered or not. When the server came back with our drinks, she said, \"Just so you know, the water IS filtered.\" I'm glad she at least found out, but she said it was such attitude that we felt extremely unwelcome.  My husband sat facing the kitchen area and he noticed that all the servers disappeared into the back together, leaving the restaurant unattended for long periods of time, only coming out (eventually) when the door chimed.   When they did come out (all together) they seemed to be laughing and goofing off. It was like every customer in the restaurant was an inconvenience to whatever little party was going on back there. Very unprofessional. Have fun and laugh in the restaurant with the patrons. They'll appreciate the good vibes.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, which was delicious, my husband ordered three eggs, hash browns and toast and my son got the ribeye again, same as the other location. He thought it was a little overdone, but enjoyed it.   So the food was good, but we won't come back to this location. Our server was rude and couldn't even get up the gumption to say good morning in a breakfast place. It was an off-putting atmosphere. Just a suggestion to the management, make sure your employees are more the \"Morning Person\" type.",

This one is smaller, a little bit more closed in, and has been just open for a month. Service was good, but not fabulous. Just seem like you have to constantly ask for things like water, napkins, straws, and etc. I ordered a cappuccino and I got whip and caramel on top thinking it comes with it. However, I found out they charge 95cents extra. Everything is ala carte here. Food was yummy except for one dish. The Loco Moco. They served it with day old rice and hard rice from the bottom of the pot. Ground beef was burnt. The waitress took it back and they brought it back with the same rice with a different patty with no eggs. By the time we got it back, everyone was done with their meal and nothing was solved. I could have chipped a tooth with the rice it came with. Waitress was apologetic and took off the check. The thing is, one person went out still hungry with an overpriced check.  Therefore, I don't think I will go back to this one because it was the manager that still approved for the meal to go out the same way the second time. Horrible. This is my reason I gave this place three stars. Or if you still go, don't get the Loco Moco!",

The ribeye is rubbed in coffee grounds and it was sooo juicy and flavorful. I had the Lox and Cream cheese omelet. I never thought I would enjoy capers in my eggs but wow! This location is the first that serves alcohol and I had the pleasure of trying their sake Bloody Mary. It was light and full of flavor.  Our server, Dane, was informative and super friendly.

    "text": "We happened to browse the reviews today and saw one by Maria C stating her dissatisfaction with her visit a couple of weeks ago. Since we are the people referred to in this review (the people who decided to leave), we feel we need to set the record straight. Maria C at least admits that her child was having a meltdown. Beyond that, however, her description is totally inaccurate. She did absolutely nothing to control her child's tantrum. The tantrum was quite extreme & went on and on and on, shrieking screaming and all, and everyone in the restaurant appeared very greatly annoyed. My wife and I couldn't carry on a conversation; indeed, we couldn't even hear each other. We watched other customers go over to their table to ask the mother if she would consider taking the child outside. The mother displayed a cavalier attitude and sarcastically told those customers to \"have a nice day.\" It would have been impossible for us to stay and have breakfast and so we advised the staff that we needed to leave. One of the staff came out to the parking lot right after we left and told us that this party was leaving. So we came back in and had (a wonderful) breakfast.  We take the time to set the record straight as we find it appalling that Maria C would blame anyone in the restaurant for her own failure to supervise her child. Her deliberate indifference to everyone else in the restaurant that day was unjustified. She made no apologies, showed no concern, and instead acted as if it were she who should be aggrieved. She took no responsibility for herself , her child, or the chaos being created. And now to see that she wrote a negative review on Yelp  and totally distorted what happened that day is nothing less than shocking.",

Upon entering the restaurant you get a feeling that it isn't an ordinary restaurant, there are umbrellas hanging from the celling, some were spinning which kept my 7 month old preoccupied enough for us to get through breakfast. The servers were in comfy pjs (jealous!) and place was definitely bright and not too crowded, service was also quick. I got the loco moco and my husband got the steak and eggs. Now the steak and eggs were good but compared to it the loco moco was next level that hubby keep stealing bites off my plate. It was so good we went back the next week and both got the loco moco again because we didn't want to share. Lol. The loco moco had a teriyaki gravy that was to die for. We will definitely be back.",
