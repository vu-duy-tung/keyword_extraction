    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't wow me.  It was ok.  I would come here again if I was on the east side of town, but it certainly isn't a place I would shout about from the top of a mountain (kudos if you got the Ron Burgundy reference).  I came here with a party of 10 at 8:00 on a Saturday night.  They were able to seat us within 10 minutes, which pleasantly surprised me.  The servers were very attentive and friendly.  Their promptness was a definite plus for me.  Now let's talk sushi.  I got the all you can eat, which is only $23.95 and basically pays for itself if you order two rolls.  Nice price, and the AYCE includes appetizers and desserts, which was also surprising to me.  However, if you do not get the AYCE, you will be very dismayed by some of the a la carte selections and pricing.  For example, seaweed salad is $4.00, but it comes in a bowl about the size of a soy sauce holder.  Also, mochi ice cream is $3.00 for two tiny pieces!  For nigiri sushi, I sampled red snapper, scallop, and halibut.  Red snapper is usually my most favorite because there is usually a citrusy sauce they put on it, but alas, this red snapper was bone dry...and a little too warm for my  liking.  In fact, I felt like all of the nigiri could have been a little cooler.  For rolls, I tried the caterpillar, double salmon, deep fried mussels, and son of the beach.  I was a little disappointed with the rolls because the caterpillar and double salmon were extremely dry, and the deep fried mussels and son of the beach were way overly sauced.  There is no middle ground at Yama.  However, another plus to this place is that you can order half rolls to try and see if you will like them.  Like I said...it was OK and I would give them a try again.",

    "text": "Good: The Sushi comes out amazingly fast. It comes out too fast. The baked rolls come out  in a normal amount of time, and they're baked! The No Name Roll was my favorite but there were many excellent choices. I am tempted to take off a point because the Harry Potter roll was the worst roll I had (still good!) and damn it show some respect to the Boy who Lived! Great Service.  Bad: This place is a shoebox and it's popular so you're going to wait. Also my party discovered that if you take down 15 rolls between three people the waitresses are going to talk about it. Which is probably healthy shame. Also this place gave me diabetes, but I think I am partially to blame. Also we were close enough to the table next to us to feed each other.  The Bizarre: Mounds of Sushi, Seafood Salad, Ice Cream: and I'm not full. What the hell is going on here?  Will return.",

Took 15 mins for our for our first order and then found out they were out of both hamachi and salmon kama (one of the reasons we chose thus place) - then it was constant follow up on nearly everything ordered - they even forgot to bring wasabe and ginger when we finally had 3 rolls on the table... took an additional 5 mins to finally get those basic sushi essentials delivered - after asking. Additionally,  never once a smile from our two sour puss waitresses who seemed unhappy to work here... created significant stress for what should have been an enjoyable experience for my daughter's birthday... completely opposite from the great service we received at island sushi last week...  anyway, upon leaving, after paying the bill and explaining to our waitress why I only left her a $10 tip on a $125 bill, I spoke with the manager - who really seemed disinterested in hearing my opinion.  Bottom line : i won't be back and cannot in good conscience recommend to others...  wow, I'm all worked up again after reliving the experience so I'm downgrading from 2 stars to 1.",

I went with a group of three people, and with a few beers and three AYCE sushis, our bill was only around 85 bucks.  And that even includes any and all appetizers, salads, typical rolls, specialty rolls AND dessert!  I was floored.  The quality of the food and the service were spot on as well.  I had heard there is sometimes a long wait, but our group was seated right away at 6:45pm on a Saturday night, that's pretty good.  If you go later than this, expect a long wait.  But I can confirm,  it's totally worth it.  Recommended rolls:  No Name was the BOMB, Yama Crunch was super tasty...they were by far my favorites.  I also enjoyed the Harry Potter and the Happy Ending.  The Firecracker was OK.  You can even order half rolls which I love!  Allows you to try so many things.  The seafood salad was fresh and lots of spice!  Edamame and tempura were as you would expect them to be, but nothing spectacular.  For dessert, try the mochi ice cream...soo good!  Chocolate and mango were my faves.  Mmmm, craving sushi now.",

However, I did enjoy the seafood salad, which is a large bowl of sashimi limit one per person. The sushi chef Jun was very friendly.  The only reason I rate it a 3 star is for the stingy service. I was working on my last 4 piece order when I asked for the check. The server refused to return my credit card until I finish all 4 pieces due to the \"left over surcharge policy\".",

Every time I'm in Vegas (which mind you was A LOT), I go out of my way to find this little restaurant off of Flamingo. It's a spot for locals, not tourists, but I don't care. Amazing AYCE sushi at a reasonable price? Count me in!   I live in LA and nothing even begins to come close in terms of quality and price. This place is legit. I hate waiting in lines but I'm willing to wait an hour and a half/two hours for a table.   Sushi does take a while to make, so order appetizers to keep you busy. I carb load here before every Vegas Marathon and it does not disappoint.   I took my friend here for the first time and he almost wept by how great it was (and I know it wasn't from the wasabi!).",

For the two of us it came out to about $53 for two people. I know it's a little less for lunch.  The service is great. Even at their very busiest, we were still attended quite regularly. Our glasses are never empty! The only downer to this place might be how cramped it can be. This is not the place to be if you are trying to have a private conversation with someone no matter how low you try to speak! lol! Also, be careful of the slippery floors! While walking in to our table or leaving there was many a day when my feet slid! I didn't know this place doubled as a skating rink! lol! It is quite crowded during peak meal times so we try to go when it is off-peak.   The food is fantastic! The presentation is very nice. The tables are small so we try and order about two or three dishes at a time. Usually when one comes out we can chow down on it while waiting for the others to come to free up some space. The restaurant isn't so fancily decorated, but who cares, I came for the food! A big plus is being able to order half rolls. You know what that means? You can try a lot more of the great sushi! I must have been born a bear in a past life because I cannot get enough of the salmon! A must-have for the bf is the Palm Job. It is so delish! It has spicy crab in a soy paper wrap. I don't like spicy foods, however, I do steal a bite or two of this!",

You can also order half rolls which is a plus and you can order as much mochi as you want but their mochis are a bit hard so u have to wait a while for it to soften up.

    "text": "Yama is the best place to go for All You Can Eat sushi in Vegas!  Don't let the fact that it's located off the Strip, pretty much in the ghetto scare you away.  Once inside, you too will become a fan!    When they say all you can eat, they fucking mean it!  Anything, and I mean anything (as many as you want) can be ordered.  Any of their combo rolls, specialty rolls, individual sushi, appetizers, dessert...let me repeat myself everything on the menu is fair game.  You've got to try the green mussels and soft shell crab.  They don't give you a shitload of rice with tiny pieces of fish like most AYCE.  It also doesn't fall apart or look like something some illegal Mexican rolled.  These Japanese sushi chefs (a rare find for Vegas) are making each item a work of (edible) art.   I've actually ordered so much food (on several occasions) that I thought I would get kicked out of the place.  I've made the mistake of checking off too many items when I first sit down that midway through my meal, I pray that no more is coming.  Whenever I've taken friends here, I put in the first order and they are shocked at how many items arrive on our table.  They too can't believe that we aren't eventually cut off or asked to leave.  There's no dead fish smell when you walk in the door which is a sign that one should turn around and seek their sushi elsewhere.  You can go down the street and eat at Hamada where you will pay much more and get much less.  That place is a tourist trap in a prime location where Yama is a local's joint.  What's funny (or sad really) is I'm back up in Seattle now...where we get a lot of fresh seafood.  I still haven't found a sushi joint that can compare to Yama.  It's pretty ironic that I've eaten better sushi in the desert than I have up here on the west coast.  Whenever Morimoto comes to Vegas, I take him here and he is pleased.  :)",

Many many places on and off the strip to choose from, but we were hungry! Love Nobu and all, but we wanted to do some serious eating.  Read the reviews, so we chose Yama.  Close enough to both the \"Strip\" AND downtown Plenty of parking  Crowded, but we were seated right away \"All you can eat\" is pretty simple: $20.?? for lunch, $23.?? for dinner Make sure you eat everything (no leaving rice from the nigiri), and no leftovers, and this will be truly all-u-can-eat! Fresh tasting assorted rolls, nigiri, noodles... All were excellent! Our favorite was the Spicy Sexy Roll. Soooo spicy AND flavorful!

The Harry Potter roll was great but the volcano roll was terrible. The roll itself was eh but the baked fish on top was what killed it for me. There was more baked salmon on top than there was roll and it was dry. Somehow I are enough of it to not be charged for uneaten food and has some chocolate ice cream which was pretty good. So I guess just stay away from the baked rolls and you'll have an average sushi place.",

Post renovation: - there's an actual waiting area - decor flows well throughout the restaurant - new menu design - more elbow room  I never order rolls. I usually eat off other people's rolls. I'm all for appetizers and nigiris. There is one dish that you must have when you're at Yama. Seafood Salad either mild or spicy. It used to come as a bigger portion but it has gotten smaller. Probably because it's part of AYCE?  Just like my previous review, they don't take reservations. But when I got there, there was no wait. This was a Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.  Yama never disappoints me.",

    "text": "Looking for a place to eat sushi? Tired of always going to Sushi Mon? Well, here is your next pick; Yama Sushi. This place will give you all you can eat... AND THEN some.  All you can eat: Lunch (11 A.M. - 3 P.M.) - $20.95 Dinner (3 P.M. - 11 P.M.) - $23.95  What I've noticed is that the menu items priced individually, are actually overpriced by 2-3x per dish. For example, A garlic tuna would normally cost about $2.75 here in Hawaii while they are charging $5.50. By looking at the individual item prices, you may basically be forced into getting All You Can Eat to get the best bang for your buck.  So now that you have been convinced to get the All You Can Eat, what exactly do you WANT to eat? These are my top 5. 1. Seafood Salad 2. Soft Shell Crab 3. Ikura 4. Eel (unagi) 5. Deep Fried Mussel  I suggest you AVOID the uni. As our uni was probably very old (to the point it was brown instead of orange). The texture was also described as \"rubbery\" by our fellow uni expert. Then, when I decided to try one, it had absolutely no flavor, just rice and stale nori.  The service was good, but the speed was horrible. Food was coming out of order and not to the individual people who ordered it. We left before a few of our dishes even made it to our table (which we ordered an hour ago). It seems that the kitchen is rather very disorganized or just tremendously slow. It is very possible that you will eat until you are full, then you get bombarded by plates you ordered last year. Buyer BEWARE!  There are a lot of good things on this menu. The fish, considering it needed to cross a desert to get here, is not bad. Would I come again? Maybe, but not likely.",

I went here super hungry after not eating all day until 5pm and still everything was mediocre. Their seaweed they used to make their nigiri was super soggy and chewy as soon as it hit our table.   Ikura was really salty and fishy aka not fresh Hamachi was not fresh, had a sour aftertaste to it Uni was low quality and had that ocean animal dookie aftertaste to it. Amaebi had a shitload of overpowering sauce on it, hiding the mediocre flavor. Tuna poki had way too much sauce on it. The best thing I ate here was the shrimp tempura and the hamachi kama.  My first time EVER not ordering two rounds of nigiri because I was so disappointed in the quality. For 2 more bucks you can get MUCH higher quality ayce sushi at Sushi Goyemon or Sushi twister.. Sushi twister on Boulder Hwy is still the best in my opinion and worth the drive.",

The price really can't be beat; only $23.95 for dinner and $20.95 for lunch! That's right folks, pretty sweet deal alert here!  Came here on a Friday evening around 630PM and the wait was.. horrible. Really bad. We ended up waiting about 50 minutes for a table for 3. Just be prepared.. really prepared. If you have a big party, they do take reservations so call in advance! The restaurant is very small and cramped but once you sit down, just sit back and prepare your stomachs.   The names of the specialty rolls are super full and suggestive. Some of our favorite rolls of the night included Sun on the Beach, Who's Your Daddy, Happy Endings and well, you get it. Very amusing names and there are just soooo many different rolls to choose from. TIP: You can get half rolls if you and your table just want to try a roll and see how you like it! Nigiri was also tasty and each order comes with 2 pieces.   The sides are also plentiful and delicious. I really enjoyed the agedashi tofu and the tempura was really fresh and crispy! Our table also shared the BBQ ribs (kalbi) and gyoza which were good as well.   Dessert was a choice of ice cream (green tea, red bean, etc) and mochi ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, mango and chocolate)!  All in all, great meal for a wonderful price. Everything was good quality and seriously, the price can't be beat for Vegas AYCE sushi!",

The Rice to fish ratio was okay. The Tako was wet and I'm not used to that so I wasn't a fan. But that's not a big deal. I then ordered my old usual favorite ( used to come here all the time but hadn't been back in a long time because I moved far away) the Yama Crunch roll, it isn't as good as I remembered but that's because my taste had changed over time it was too sweet for me but still yummy. I also ordered the DAM!! Harry which was DELICIOUS! So delicious I forgot to take a picture of it. I also ordered the man whore which was really good!! Perfect balance of sweet and hot.  I highly recommend those rolls.  My friend loves the Harry Potter roll and ordered two of them when we were there.  The service was fast even though it was packed! Never had empty water or tea. Ever.   Love this place and I highly recommend it. Just make sure you go earlier than you plan on eating on a Sunday night it was a 30 min wait.",

However, the value (with their all you can eat system) is unparalleled. Just remember that they won't let you \"cheat\" the system. Finish your roll before ordering another, eat everything on the plate, and eat what YOU order, don't share everything amount he table. It seems strict, but given the quality and value it's the only way they can still make a profit on this system. Also, for those of you worried about sanitation, I am a student at the Culinary Institute of America, and I've been thoroughly trained on proper food handling and storage. Based on what I've seen, they have impeccable safe food handling. And the fish is definitely quality (if Morimoto is an A+, and gas station is an F, I'd give this a B+",

Let me first say that service was prompt, we were seated quickly at the bar, and I generally liked the sushi chef for his attentiveness.  The only thing that we enjoyed was the sashimi salad recommended by the chef.  The presentation was a train wreck, but the flavors were spot on and had a great amount of spice and kick to it.  Edamame was decent too.  Now for the rest of the night...  Our miso soups tasted...odd.  The tofu took on a rancid taste and the texture melted in your mouth (not in a good way).  Nigiri after nigiri seemed very dried out and no amount of soy sauce could lather up the texture.  Honestly, I've had better raw fish at conveyor belt sushi restaurants.  The chef recommended two different sushi rolls with one of them being the no name roll.  Anything that was put in the roll was completely overpowered with a sauce that looked and tasted like creamy tostitos salsa.  A very disappointing dish that is supposedly a favorite there that was also recommended by the chef.  We finished with mochi which was nothing that really stood out to me.    I don't see the hype and it's astounding to me they are as popular as they are.",

    "text": "The best thing about this place? UNLIMITED UNI. I would be happy about that even if the uni was bad.  Luckily, for sea urchin lovers, the uni is NOT bad.  It is mediocre, maybe even a little better than mediocre. YAY!  But really. That's the only good thing.   First and foremost, I am very considerate when it comes to any kind of AYCE restaurants.  I lower my standards and appreciate the fact that I get to stuff myself 'til I loathe myself. Especially at a low lunch price for $21! What. Uni, too? WHAT.  SERVICE Eh. Friendly at first but that started to dwindle as they were obviously getting annoyed of us.  We had a party of 8, so why is it bad that we start with 40-50 pieces of sushi?  Yeah, I read your rules.  (BTW you have to order with your server; they do not have a sushi list. Inconvenient, especially for AYCE) And if you're going to put in our order a little at a time \"for\" us, then at least let us know. Jeeeeez.   FISH QUALITY Not there. Period. The tuna was almost brown. What da... Oh and the sushi rice? So bland. Fish to rice ratio? Idk but more rice than fish for sure.   Actually, I did like another thing. The menu has a huge variety and you even get free dessert (1 per person) But no green tea mochi ice cream? Weird.  This place isn't bad if you really want to just get sushi-wasted; just don't come with a big group, expecting good food.",

    "text": "$20 lunch & $24 dinner for AYCE sushi, best deal around!  If you're in Vegas and feel like veering off the strip for some good food, stop by Yama.  You'll find a variety of specialty rolls (dragon rolls, salmon rolls, etc) to choose from along with a good selection of nigiri sushi.  Order anything off the menu, but be sure to finish it or else you'll be charged a la carte for each order left unfinished.  Make room for the ice cream or mocha at the end also!  Tips: Everyone in the group must purchase AYCE in order to get the deal. Order a little at a time (you'll see this on the menu). You can share with the group if you're all getting AYCE. Rice is super filling, so is cream cheese!",

It was about 8:00pm, so not much available in the airport, and I was hungry for sushi.  Looked it up on Yelp, and found Yama Sushi. Grabbed a cab, and off I went.  Wasn't terribly impressed with the location when I got out, but I was committed. I went in, and it was like a locals party going on.  There were only about 3 spots open at the bar, so I grabbed one. Everyone in the place seemed to be a local, and they were extremely friendly, giving their ideas about what was best.  It isn't really clear when you first look at the menu, but it is all-you-can-eat for $23 (with a 2 hour time limit). However, they aren't like most all-you-can-eat sushi joints...here, each roll is hand made to your specs.  There were 8 guys behind the bar, and they were working at light-speed.  The food was great, beer was cold, and you definitely don't leave hungry. I didn't have a single thing that evening that wasn't excellent.  I will definitely be back.  Spencer",

This is the most generous AYCE sushi place that I've ever experienced. You can order anything on the menu, including all the specialty sushi, appetizers, and dessert. We arrived at the restaurant right at the time of the opening for brunch. It is so popular that the dining room just got filled up quickly, and a long line was formed. The service was very fast and friendly. We first ordered 4 specialty full sushi, 2 specialty single order sushi and the soft shelled crab. We should have ordered half order since the full order sushi filled us up pretty quickly. There are almost 10 pieces per order. We then ordered sweet shrimp (very interesting half tempura shrimp head and raw seasoned tail), seafood salad (which is full of various fish and vegetables) and another uni sushi (my wife liked it). They are all flavorful and tasty! By this time, we filled up our stomach, and saved some room for mochi mango dessert - very delicious and not too sweet. Altogether the meal would have been almost $80's, but we paid about half of it (excluding tips). I'll make sure to revisit on my next trip to Vegas!",

It just brings memories of Fuji's in Davis, Sushi Pier in Reno, etc.  This is nothing new in looks, but they do put up a good reputation and offers more things with certain limits to the customers.   It's a small stretch on the take of sushi restaurants, but its good to know that this exists here.  Otherwise, I'd say its skippable, especially if you're not a sushi fan.    The fish here isn't the freshest, but which AYCEs are I dare ask.  They do offer scallops, big clams, mussels, uni, ikura, and other stuff where other AYCEs may not, which is a highlight, but don't expect the fresh kind for either.  Out of our uni stash, which you're only allowed to have one order per person, 2 looked so suspect it was impossible to imagine eating it.  Other than that, the pieces were tiny with maybe 2-3 slabs of uni on each nigiri piece.    What I liked about the place was our server which was so helpful in pacing us and also making sure we got our orders into the kitchen/bar like the Uni and several others.  We were definitely on a mission , and she was ready to assist.    However, with the rice rules like so many other places (Reno) its hard to enjoy when all you really want is straight sashimi.  And for $21 its not bad for lunch here.  It's a bit away from the strip, but close enough where its a $15 cab ride vs god knows how long to get to Sushi Mon.    But would I ever come back...Probably not.",

Was def not worth 20% tip but we re on vacay so wth...  Lunch Total for 2 tax and tips included was $55   Prolly will try another ayce sushi instead next time when we want such.  9/14-13 Was here yesterday and decided to try Umiya today... And I'm soooo glad I did!  Umiya is by far sooooo much better than Yama!  Seating is way more comfy.  Decor is nicer.  Food is  def better.  And service is much much much much better! Yama should really step up to their game or its goodbye Yama real soon.",

    "text": "I find the the art of making sushi rolls is lost of the chefs that work here.  The first example is the how overcooked the rice is.  It's like going to an Italian place and it not being al dente.  It's inexcusable.  Maybe management should at least get one good Japanese sushis chefs to run the Mexican worker line of sushi chefs, because it seems they can make what looks like sushi but can't deliver on the essential elements that separates sushi from just being rice, fish and seaweed.   Their all you could eat deal would be fantastic if you felt like eating the sushi.  Yuck!   Many of the reviewers must be from Las Vegas and have no idea what fresh fish or good sushi is supposed to be. Fail!   Everyone was nice and friendly or i would have rated this place a 1 star.",

    "text": "THE PLACE IN VEGAS FOR AYCE SUSHI!  I've tried many AYCE sushi places throughout the years and this place is the best!  We come here often and have been doing more so ever since we moved here.  Let me start by saying I'm not a die hard sashimi eater and I love the generic, americanized sushi rolls...meaning, I like the fusion rolls, fried, with spicy mayo and sweet sauce; so this place is perfect for me.  First of all, there a tremendous selection of high quality rolls, that beats other places. My friend and I tried to figure out what makes this place so good, and we think it's a combination of the fresh fish and the different sauces and the way the chefs prepare the rolls.    Order what you can eat, because they will charge you for excess!  Rolls not to miss are the Sun of the Beach, No Name, and Wet Dream!  Sun of the Beach is one of the best rolls I've ever had!   The seafood salad is big and plentiful and the yellowtail collar is awesome!  Those two dishes alone would cost you over $20 at any sushi joint.  There is a roll not currently on the menu and they named it after the manager.  It combines a sort of salsa sauce and has a little kick to it!  If you get it, you won't be disappointed.  Top it off with your favorite mochi for dessert and I've yet not left that place feeling like I need to be rolled out!    I Love Yama Sushi!",

They had quite a few different types of rolls but a lot of it had cream cheese, or fried something which was a bit too heavy for me. One thing that I would not suggest ordering would be the UNI, it wasn't that fresh... Other than that, the food was good, the service was good. :] ENJOY!",

    "text": "Oh, Yama. Where do I even begin. Every time I am in Vegas, I absolutely HAVE to eat here. It's that good. I realize that being from Texas, it's not exactly a sushi mecca, nor do I claim to be an expert by any means, however, Yama deserves a solid 4 stars from me for everything from their sushi to their service. First things first, you're almost guaranteed a wait when you go here. Note that I've only gone for dinner, not lunch, so I can't comment on that. I'd suggest venturing to the questionable yet ever so fun Dottie's next door, where you can play slots/video poker until your table is ready, and the hostesses will actually come and find you there. Awesome. Speaking of table, I've never sat at one. I've always opted for the sushi bar. If you can, head to the bar in the new addition over on the right. Trust.  After sitting down, order the AYCE. Because why would you do it any other way. The AYCE includes all of their rolls, specialty rolls, hand rolls, sushi, etc, PLUS, the seafood salad that you absolutely must try. Get it spicy. And thank me later. I think my favorite rolls are the Wet Dream and No Name. I also love getting the white tuna, when they have it, and you have to end your meal with some mochi.  Love Yama. Love everything about it. Definitely give it a shot if you're in Vegas. You'll be happy you did!",

There were fish bones inside the sushi roll and when I had asked one of the workers they said it was normal and that you can eat it. The sushi is so gross here and doesn't taste fresh at all.   Service needs to be worked on tremendously also. We had sat down BEFORE these 3 other men but however when we wanted to order she said she'll be back. Next thing we know she was taking the other people's order and then left and never came back for our order. Someone else had to take it. When she had came back to our table she was showing much attitude and didn't seem to want to tend to us at all.  Will never be coming back.",

The resto was very cramped and we we're seated at a table for two with another table for two to my left, and one to my right, with just a makeshift border between us; way too close for comfort.  Basically, the sushi they offer is heavily dressed with sauces, flakes, and whatnot, not to mention the sushi rice was terribly heavy, that's where they make their money with the AYCE.  The staff also seemed very hurried and short, but to their credit, we got our orders very quick.  Sorry, can't say we'll be back, and that's the last time I'll trust my one cousin's recommendation!

Third round - I finally order sushi rolls, but I always tell them to do HALF rolls so that I can try a variety of rolls without having to stuff myself and worry that I would have to pay an additional fee if there's any left over.   By now my stomach is 85% full   Fourth round- Desserts!!! Which I usually get mochi ice cream and green tea ice cream.   Overall, my favorite sushi place when in Las Vegas  The taste is phenomenal, service is up to par, and nice ambiance.  ** located in Spring Mountain center somewhere near Lee's Sandwich, the only thing I dislike is finding parking during peak hours.",

It's nestled in what appears to be a slightly older strip mall, but the service and food are excellent. The food seemed fresh and lived up to what we expected.

A plate of salmon came out with 2 gray pieces!! It was crazy!!! ....Now here is where it gets good!!!.... the checks come.... they had a 40%auto grad added onto the check!!! ... now i like many am horrible about never looking and just tossing a card down and tipping on top.... if one of my party didn't notice they would have got it...

Our servers were very friendly and fast; we kept placing orders and they kept bringing the food.   I ordered so much nigiri, sashimi, seaweed salad, and miso soup. All of the fish tasted fresh and the nigiri did not have too much rice, unlike other all-you-can-eat places I've been to. I also ordered a roll but I didn't like it very much because it was covered in mayo. In fact, most of the rolls at our table were covered with sauce, so I don't recommend wasting time and stomach space on the sushi rolls.  Definitely try to order two or three things at a time rather than ordering a bunch of food you think you can finish at once because they WILL charge you for unfinished food.

I also sampled the tuna and salmon nigiri which was also good but not the best nigiri I've tried in town, it just wasn't as smooth as butter as some others I've had. Tasty, though.

    "text": "What I like about Yama: They serve full-size appetizers when you do AYCE (6 gyoza, 4 shrimp tempura, etc.) while most other places in town do half size appetizers. Not a huge plus because you can always get multiple orders of most appetizers. On the flip side, I also like that there's a half size options for most rolls so you can try a lot of things. There was ONE server out of 5 we interacted with who was friendly and attentive. She was great! Price for AYCE is great (I think $21 for lunch and $23 for dinner).  What I dislike about Yama: The other four of the 5 servers who were rude, disregarded items we ordered, requests for water, napkins, menus, etc. Each request was met with either no acknowledgment, or a fake quick smile before the server would take off and never bring what we asked for. The sushi chefs are apparently amateurs because none of the rolls were cut anywhere close to evenly. One piece could be 0.5\" thick while another in the same roll was 1.5\" thick. The rice they used for sushi rolls was really mushy to where on the side of a roll, it didn't even look like grains of rice - just a smooth white surface. Rolls were hard to chew and swallow because they were really, really not enjoyable to eat. Flavor was good, but texture is also so important to sushi!   If you're in the mood for AYCE, I recommend a few places far above Yama in quality and experience - JJANGA, Sakana, Umiya, and Kaizen (on Deer Springs; the one on Paradise isn't AYCE).",

My friend and I could both tell the fish was either old or it had been frozen then defrosted based on the texture. The flavor was lacking and the shrimp tempura was sopping with grease. Apparently, they can't get the soda right anymore either as it was mostly flat.   As for the service?  It's now the worst I've ever experienced at a sushi establishment.  We had to wait too long for refills on drinks, between orders and then were given a wrong order. When this was pointed out, the server said, \"Oh, the chef must've gotten confused between #29 and #19,\" then proceeded to ask us if we wanted it anyway.\" Seriously? My friend and I asked what was going on to explain the drop in food quality and found out there's been a change of ownership sometime in the last few months.   We left unsatisfied, aggravated and worst of all, experiencing food poisoning symptoms a few hours later.  I have now filed a complaint with the health department. I hope they get their act together soon and stop putting public health at risk. You can't disrespect your clientele like this and expect them to return.  This pair of once loyal customers will not.",

Overall the food was very good and well prepared not cheap/slop as one would expect. The service is super fast and plenty of wait staff around to help all the time. It was Fri night at 10pm and it was packed. The sushi was fresh and clean tasting and the rice was not overstuffed which showed they were not trying to fill you up on rice.......very impressive. We had a few exotic rolls with interesting sauces and each was unique and distinct. The deep fried soft shell crab appetizer was surprisingly good for such an inexpensive restaurant. The hamachi kama was the only dish that was literally ruined by over cooking it. I have had the real thing (large cuts off the head/shoulder) in Japan and Hong Kong for years and the way it should be is barely cooked over an open flame which draws out all of the oil and makes the fish super moist and melts in your mouth. This was dry and therefore almost tasteless compared to the real thing.  But the truly amazing standout at this restaurant is clearly the seafood salad. We started out with one and devoured it in joy. The dressing is very spicy so be careful......but it was bursting with flavor. What they do (in my opinion) is use the end cuttings from the sashimi plus 2 pieces of tempura shrimp for the ingredients. Amazing, pieces of every kind of fish and scallops and all melted in your mouth. Even the odd cut pieces of salmon were smooth as silk. When they asked for last orders we were pretty stuffed so decided on one more of the seafood salad (one allowed for each diner) but when it came out we were blown away.....it had twice as much fish as the first order.....it was absurd, had to have at least 25 pieces of fish/scallops....we could not even finish it and had to waddle out the front door because of it. Here's the thing: if you eat sushi in any form it is filled with rice, the menu does not offer sashimi for this reason: most would order it over sushi so as not to fill up. Well this dish is all sashimi and then some...........you can eat great fish and not get overly filled up to leave room for some of the great appetizers.  Will be back next time we are in Vegas.",

The AYCE (All You Can Eat) buffet was an amazing deal and they don't limit your selection to the basic rolls, like other AYCE sushi places I've been.  It wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, but it was by far the best value.  Only wish I'd saved room for some desert.  Also the place was really really crowded and we had a 20 min wait but it was worth it.",

The AYCE menu has a variety of appetizers such as seaweed or seafood salads, yakatori, gyoza, mussels, miso, and more! Overall the fish quality is fresh and the variety of rolls is great.   Yama sushi is kind of small and seems to be always packed with people waiting outside but its well worth it! Since its always busy, the service can get kind of slow especially when you've ordered a lot of rolls. If you get the all you can eat, order appetizers while waiting for your rolls and nigri! One of my favorite parts about this place is that they offer green tea ice cream and strawberry and chocolate mochi for dessert!  If you're a fan of sushi and ayce, I HIGHLY recommend trying this place!",

    "text": "This place was definitely worth the extra effort of traveling off the strip for food, despite the nightmare that occurred while trying to get back (keep reading for the full story).  First, we had a group of 11, so the place reserved their side room for us which was pretty awesome. Next, the wait staff was super cool and patient with waiting for our mess of people to figure out what sushi/other foods they wanted. Then, the food came out and was absolutely delicious. After, the chefs even sent out some rolls they made special for us because they thought we would like them. Finally, the mochi/ice creams are included with the AYCE deal, so dessert was free (and fantastic).  The best dishes there? The Giant Clam piece was unbelievably delicious and really fun to tell people that you're eating (get it?!). Wet Dream was tantalizing. The Yama Special was perfectly prepared. The Seafood Salad had great pieces of fish in a fantastic sauce that I actually used instead of soy sauce for some of my tuna rolls. They offered Uni with the AYCE, and although I didn't like it I certainly appreciated that I was able to try it. The Edamame was low in salt for a change, which I can't praise enough. The best part is that no one had a piece of fish that was unpleasant, a feat not to be taken lightly at an AYCE sushi place. Also, the three people who decided not to get the sushi deal said that their dishes were also delicious and that they would go back again as well.  After the meal, the manager called us some cabs to get us back to the strip, which was really nice of her to do. The cabs didn't show after the 30 minute promised window, which if you know the politics involved with Vegas cabs really doesn't come as a surprise, so the manager called them again and complained. Then one cab finally came, which wasn't enough for all of us, so she called yet again to get us a ride back. Meanwhile, the restaurant is closing up shop behind us, but they asked us to wait inside their lobby area because it was cold outside and kept telling us we weren't in the way and asking if there was anything else we could do for them. This is what solidified their 5-star rating from me - I can't imagine anywhere else where the food is so good and the staff is so friendly and accommodating. Overall, this was the best eating experience on the trip and I say it was definitely worth the traveling hassle to eat there.",

Thanks yelpers! The food was on point! You can have all the special rolls you like! But be aware of their strict rules...you have to eat the rice on the sushi, so forget trying to skip the carbs. Also you have to finish everything you order so no wasting food. They will charge you extra if you don't adhere to the rules. I'm not a big eater but I can get down. So, as long as I get $23 worth of food I'm good. Which isn't hard with sushi. Today I ended up with a total of $38  I recommend making reservations. Also its not a big restaurant so its better to bring a small group.",

The food keeps coming.  And sushi is delish.  Favorites were the fried softshell crabs, the firecracker sushi with jalapenos, the Son of a Beach rolls... okay, I take that back... I enjoyed everything!  I concur with the yelp advice to order half orders to maximize sampling of the extensive menu.  The nice meal after winning a few benjamins from betting on the horsies at the bellagio... made our last dinner in Vegas just super.  Although the waitress was in training, she did her best... and that is all you can ask.  The meal concluded with some green tea ice cream and mochi ice cream!

The restaurant is located just right off the strip in a plaza with a huge parking lot, so the location and parking is a super plus. The wait time isn't that bad, but when I went, it was SUPER hot inside.   For the actual food, they have all the usual rolls, but they also have a bunch of specialty rolls that they created themselves. All these specialty rolls also have these HILARIOUS names that are all very sexual (like wet dream, happy ending, and manwhore). I recommend not touching any of the ordinary rolls and just try one order of everything and share with your friends. They are all delicious and its also hilarious listening to the waitress repeat your order to you. There is also unlimited ice cream and mochi included in your dinner! I would definitely come back in the future. Great food, great price, great location!",

When I read the reviews, only this one had the good reviews. Our sushi chef for this all you can eat, was Fat Macho, according to his name tag. Sitting at the counter, we watched him work his imagination and wizardry. I didn't order off the menu. I just said give me some spice and do what you want. What wisdom! OK, I haven't a clue what anything would have been called in the menu reality. Truthfully, I don't care either. What I had was incredible. I find in most places, the rolls, etc, have about the same taste. Not True here. Each one of the sauces  had a different flavor. No two tasted the same. Clearly, Fat Macho was a pro and really cared about exciting our sushi experience. The staff were ever observing to see if you needed anything without being intrusive. Bravo on our brief but richly satisfying culinary delight! Whenever I return to Vegas, you can make sure I'll be back...and I will give my chums in CA a great tip! Just a quick PS. This little event will probably ruin my sushi dining experiences back home, like fish and chips in London did. But...it was well worth it!",

When I finally realized that I have left my bag there and called them several hours later, a waitress who I spoke with over the phone told me that they have found my bag and she was nice enough to take her time to verify with me that all my belongings seemed to be there. She also reassured me that I could come back at anytime to retrieve it, and that she would turn it in to the manager for safe keeping until I could make it back from my road trip.   4 days later from the day I lost my bag, we stopped by to pick it up. I was speechless when I got my bag back completely intact!  I offered a cash reward to the lady who brought the bag out to me(I believe she might be the owner), but she refused to accept it. Instead, she thanked us for dinning at their restaurant, and wished us a safe trip back home...   We had 2 great meals there, both the quality and the variety of the food is unbelievable.

The service was slow. we expected to wait a bit to be seated on a Saturday night, but once we were seated we still waited 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. During our dinner service was ok. I got a nasty warm flat coke so asked for iced green tea instead and was charged for both. then our check came, I looked it over everything looked fine, the guy that has been filling drinks took it and brought it back and suddenly multiple beers have been added to it and he already charged my card! they void the payment then charge me the correct amount, thus charging me twice and took a week to be back in my bank...obnoxious and not worth it.",

It might have just been the novelty of the place (and the fact that it had been a while since I had sushi), but my girlfriend and I had a blast, even though the service was slow.  The second time (most recent trip to Vegas), we sat at the regular tables. Water/food/any service was VERY slow. It took a while for us to order anything because of the slow service. Also, we had a hard time picking what kind of rolls we wanted because the novelty had worn off this time around. Great names for the rolls, but that's pretty much it.  We've decided that there's no need to come back to this place. Lines are long, service is slow, and the food is just mediocre. There are so many restaurants to try on and off the Strip that I don't see a need to re-visit a mediocre spot.",

The wait staff was very nice and took the time to say hello and make sure our hot tea was filled. If the fish was better quality I'd give 4 plus stars. Fish did not have too much taste and too many sauces which cover up the taste of the sushi. Sea Food Salad was pretty good, but it would of been nice not to have so much dressing. If you like sauces on your sushi this is the place for you, they have lots of sauces.",

With all of its beautiful decorations and intricate deserts, I must say I'm a fan as well.  However, when it comes down to all you can eat sushi. I'm a much stricter consumer.   Yama sushi gets notoriously busy at night. So, I went on a Friday night. Surprisingly, the wait was about 30 minutes for 3 people. We sat at the bar, a little cramped for space. Then again, I'm here for the food.  THE FOOD IS GREAT. Everything we ordered is fresh and delicious. Many of the one order/customer items are top notch. Try the seafood salad- spicy, you will not regret it.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is rather small. A long wait and a small table is almost a guarantee. However, after a good hour of non-stop eating great food. It doesn't matter.  Definitely not a sit and chat place as many waiting customers will give you the death stare. Besides, after eating a full meal, the last thing I want to do is sit and stare at the reminants of my plate.",

The BEST thing about this place is that its AYCE!!!!    I have a few staples and among them I recommend the Fire Cracker Roll: Stuffed Jalepenos tempura fried with spicy mayo; GET IT if you like a little spice! (some are spicier than others). I always get two orders because four pieces is just not enough.  Harry Potter Roll and Wet dream, also two of my favorites!   Just be sure that if you get AYCE that you do in fact EAT IT ALL because they charge you a la carte prices for what you leave behind (shouldn't be hard because its SO GOOD)!   The only reason I gave them four stars is the service, mostly lacking. They could have a wait and they won't open up certain sections and their waiters aren't the most attentive. Doesn't matter because the food here is the super star! SUPER STARRRRRR!!!! (yes, I threw in a Mary Katherine Gallagher reference)",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of sushi, especially joints that offer AYCE. I was excited to try this place as it gets good enough reviews and quite a few of my friends love it. Unfortunately, I can't join them in their enthusiasm for this particular sushi restaurant.  Being a sushi enthusiast and just plain hungry, I was excited when we were finally seated [about a 40 minute wait for three people for lunch]. I looked over their rolls and the rest of their AYCE sushi offerings. Five minutes later, someone finally came to take our drink order. The drinks arrived pretty quickly, but after that, it was just a whole bunch of waiting for our server to actually approach us.   Needless to say, once the waitress finally approached us, I told her what I wanted for my first round of ordering and my fellow diners follow suit. It's not until we finished ordering that she tells us it's only two items per person at a time. WHAT?!?! Blasphemy. First, she should have informed us after I clearly ordered more than two things, or at least before letting the other two diners order. Secondly, what kind of BS is that? I should be able to order what I want, when I want.   The wait for the foods was pretty bad too. I understand a little bit of a delay sometimes, when the restaurant is super busy - but it was just too much of a wait here. I think I spent more time waiting, than actually eating - especially with the two at a time BS. Not to mention the fact that our waitress forgot about a couple of orders [which ironically worked out for the best as I didn't really want to eat anymore of their sub-par food].   As for the quality of the fish - it was mediocre. The fish on the nigiri [tuna & yellowtail] smelled a little bit and were dry. The only reason I was able to eat my orders was because I drowned the fish in the leftover sauce from the seafood salad. The pieces of unagi they gave me were small, and all I could basically taste was the eel sauce. I did enjoy a couple of the rolls I ordered, especially one called No Name. They have an unlimited amount on desserts, but not a very huge selection. Just a few different flavors of ice cream & mochi.   All in all, I wouldn't go back. Poor fish quality, long waits, & bad service is not something I would pay 20 plus dollars for. I'll stick to my usual sushi spots instead.",

    "text": "We chose Yama because of the great feedback and reviews. Upon arrival, there a short wait of 10-15 minutes; we took this as a good sign due to popularity. We were seated and ordered our first round of AYCE sushi. Half of our order arrived quite promptly, even before our drinks. The second half of the order never arrived so we reordered along with some more options, again, some items never arrived. Upon asking for said items a third time, I was informed that I could only order some of them once....but I had never received the items in question. Eventually, I did get a few of them while others never showed up. Apparently, some items take longer than others (I knew and know this and was being patient), but when asked if everything had arrived, I brought up a few items that I hadn't received. The server then, again, proceeded to inform me that some items take longer to prepare...and then brought out the time ticket to show that the order had been placed at 9:27pm; we were shown the ticket at 9:58. A sushi dish, cooked or not, does NOT take 30+ minutes to prepare, especially when other diners around us were getting their food with lightning speed. More than 4 groups dined in the 2 tables adjacent to us while there, and they all received every item ordered within 5 minutes...I wasn't taking note of this at the beginning of our dinner, but as time wore on it became very apparent how slow and spotty our particular service was. The food was decent, the service (and attitude of our servers) was horrible. I won't be returning to Yama, but this was only my particular experience. Everyone else there appeared to have a wonderful time with great service. It is unfortunate and I'm unsure why our experience was so much worse. Perhaps my expectations were just too high?",

    "text": "Went here with a large group of friends last thursday night.  Even though we got there around 8, the place was packed and it was about a 20 to 30 minute wait.  My friend who organized the get-together didn't like how she couldn't make a reservation because we didn't have enough people for it, but since I wasn't the one planning it I won't take it into account in this review ;).    The building is small but it feel very warm.  We had table near the corner set away from the main walkway, so we didn't have people running into us or elbowing us as they walked.  The table wasn't bolted to the floor or heavy, so it was very easy to push around, and we frequently had to recenter the table due to it moving under the weight of elbows and arms.  There was a \"fake\" table leg at the head of the table which popped in and out, much to the amusement of one of my friends.    The waitress was very kind and made it a priority to make sure she got our orders down perfectly.  All of us except for one had the All You Can Eat deal for 22 bucks.  She repeated all the orders just to make sure, and even explained which ones come out faster and which ones took longer to prepare.  Not necessary, but it it shows a great commitment to customer service.  Now, for \"All-You-Can-Eat\" specials, you often go in with low expectations in terms of quality, since most places emphasize on quantity rather than quality.  The food here, however, was way above average for an All You Can Eat place.  The TNT and Vegas speciality rolls were my favorites, but the best cut I had was the smoked salmon sushi.  I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend that cut, it was the best cut of salmon I have ever eaten in an All You Can Eat sushi restaurant.    It did take us awhile to get our check when we were done, but besides that the service was good, and our waitress was extremely attentive to our order and making sure we got everything that we ordered and that it was prepared right.  On a funny note, they had NASCAR on the tv next to our table.  Quite ironic for them to have a sport like that in an Asian restaurant, lol.    PROS: Very good sushi for All You Can Eat Attentive waitress Good and fair price (i.e. you get what you pay for, and more) Clean bathrooms   CONS: Small building, can be cramped and congested on the walkways Waits can be long, especially at night, even on weekdays  WILL I RETURN?:  Absolutely!  When I'm in the mood for sushi, I'll probably come back here!",

    "text": "I may have found an all-you-can-eat sushi place that beats Midori in Los Angeles.   For $23, you can stuff your face with every fish possible (no dolphin though, they learned their lesson from Blue Fin).   PROS: GOOD FOOD  1) Only $10 corkage fee. Bring a bottle of Sake from Lee's Liquor down the street, and enjoy some sake shots with your buddies.  2) They have a private room type place that seats 8-10 people, so call ahead to reserve it; it's pretty cool.   3) THE FISH IS FRESH! You would think that the quality would be terrible for the all-you-can-eat price, but it was actually very, very fresh. My party of five devoured yellowtail, salmon, albacore, and spicy tuna sushi. They have great specialty rolls too; get the \"no name roll\", literally a party in your mouth.   4) Mochi ice cream is included in the deal, so take advantage!   5) Unlike other places, you can have people on your table opting out of the all-you-can-eat deal, and just buy a-la-carte. Convenient if someone's not too hungry!   CONS: BAD SERVICE  1) I ordered spicy scallop hand roll, and they brought me spicy (imitation) crab. I told them that it's the wrong order, and she insisted it was albacore. I tried it, called the waiter again, told her that it's definitely not scallop, so she took it back. Next came the manager with the same hand roll who told me that they apparently mix their scallop with their crab because they don't get a lot of scallop. So I tried to scavenge thru the roll to find some scallop, and I found NONE!!!!!! I get spicy scallop wherever I go, and they tried to lie to me! I told them there was no scallop in there and she tried persuading me that its somehow mixed in there.....what did they do, puree it?!  2) My friend eats sushi a lot, and he asked for at least three special orders, and our waitress didn't know what the hell he was talking about. She proceeded to tell us that she is not Japanese, but Korean. And we asked her if she could ask the sushi chef if she knew these orders, and she said that the chefs are all Korean too. Why would anyone ever use that as an excuse to be uneducated about the food they're serving? Ridiculous.   I feel like the complaints were strong enough for at most three stars, but with the price and the quality of the food, it's a great place to grab dinner before you hit the overpriced, crazy Vegas nightlife.",

They offer many creative and funnily named rolls. I recommend the no name roll and whose your daddy roll. I also love their seafood salad, its basically a sashimi salad topped with some shrimp tempura. However, be wary of their spicy grade, the two times I've ordered the seafood salad mild and found it too spicy to eat more than a few bites.  When it gets busy, service can get really slow, however the fact that the waitresses have the foresight to incrementally send in your orders, anticipating that you will get too full and want to cancel part of your order, makes up for the spotty service. Putting up with slow service beats wasting (and paying for) lots of untouched sushi or eating until your stomach explodes",

    "text": "This is one place I just HAVE to go every time I'm visiting here in LV. If you are into big spacious restaurants, this isn't for you. You sit pretty close to your neighboring tables and are easily observed. It's loud in here, but keep in mind, it's always busy and especially during the lunch hour- but you'll still have more than enough time to enjoy all the goodness this place has to offer since they are super friendly and fast!  You can't go wrong with the ALL-You-Can-Eat option! I especially prefer this since it allow me to order all kind of different sushi specials. The nice thing about it is that you can order a \"half\" order of any kind of special rolls they have to offer. Meaning you have more room to try something else. Plus you still get the great perks of ordering meat choices of chicken or beef teriyaki or korean short ribs as well.   The staff is super friendly and helpful if your not sure on what to order. The sashimi salad is sooo yummy! I highly recommend! Some servings of particular orders may seems small, but that's OK, it allows you to venture out and try other things on the menu (all you can eat menu). Regular items that are not ordered from the all you can eat menu are of the normal portion of japanese bento box style.   Quality of the food is great. Fresh sashimi, fish and seafood found here in LV? Yes!!! I spoke with the owners and chef a few times and they get daily shipments of fresh seafood. You know what that means, this place is no joke!   Price? more than reasonable for what you get. If your on a budget or just not looking to spend over $25 for a lunch or dinner, I say keep more $$$ in your wallet, avoid those corporate buffets at the hotels on the strip and enjoy some great japanese/korean food in a not so busy environment.   There is plenty of parking since this is located at a strip mall next to albertson's and CVS. You can't go wrong!!!!",

    "text": "This review is based off of my second visit about 2-3 weeks ago.  Honestly the first time I tried this place, I didn't think it was too bad. I felt lucky finding a decent sushi place so close to UNLV with good prices. However, after my last visit I take it all back. Their nigiri is mediocre at best and warm,  not chilled how it's supposed to be and it was weirdly chewy. I could barely stomach it. Their rolls aren't bad, I actually prefer their cooked items to their raw ones. Anything fried and covered in sauce is good, they're gyoza was also really good too. I'm not trying to throw this place under the bus or anything, but just be aware. I really wanted to order some ahi before I left,  but after the few pieces of warm unappetizing nigiri I had I just went for dessert instead.  Which btw, I recommend the ice cream mochi, the green tea ice cream didn't have a strong green tea flavor and that kind of made me sad. I hope this review helps!",

This could possibly be because of how busy this tiny spot gets. Service was decent even during full house and they did not hesitate to keep bringing my guest and I our tuna sushi even though we were ordering 10 orders at a time. One star was lost because of how tight quarters the tables are and everything does tend to feel rushed. Be prepared to wait for your table even on a weekday.",

I ordered the all you can eat and wasn't as hungry as usual I guess so I had about 4 pieces of Sushi left. My server told me if I didn't finish my food I would get charged extra. I let her know I've been eating there for 10 years and have spent a ton of money there and have brought several new people there but she didn't care she told me that I better eat all of my food or I will be charged for it! I couldn't eat another bite so I'm sorry to say that the sushi went into the bathroom garbage.",

Thank goodness we were at the bar so you can order directly from the sushi chefs and get your sushi fast. I've heard that at the regular tables they usually get your order wrong and takes awhile to get your sushi.   It did take while to get our diet coke and ice tea from the servers. Thus the 4 instead of 5 star review. The sushi chef also were not pleased when my coworker ordered and seafood salad and I declined it but later ordered it when I saw his. Whatever. But the seafood salad was excellent. More like sashimi in sauce since there was no veggie to speak off except shredded daikon.   I would definitely come here again. The whole meal was less than $30 per person. Quite a bargain for Vegas AYCE restaurants.",

    "text": "This is five stars for the AYCE, not for a la carte. $20.95 lunch   Came here for AYCE and it was delicious! Some AYCE joints don't offer appetizers and desserts on the menu, but Yama does. Sat at the counter with a party of four, and unless you're looking for more privacy, I'd recommend the counter. You can order rolls straight from the chef rather than through the server.   The seafood salad is pretty much a typical sashimi salad without the abundance of greens. Rather, it sat on a bed of radish strings. Would recommend. Nigiri is also on the menu and for AYCE, the hamachi was pretty good. A few items have a limit of one per customer such as the uni, amaebi, and seafood salad...understandable.   Some of my favorite rolls were the Mad Dragon (although super eel sauced) and No Name. Note that you can order HALF rolls for some of them...and if you sit at the counter you can actually talk to the sushi chef if he talks to you first =] calls for fun and giggles. Pauw made our rolls and he was pro awesomeness. They have a lot of rolls with mayo or cream cheese which isn't my preference, but if you like that this is def the place for you. It's good in moderation, but definitely not for AYCE. Of course it isn't ALL mayo or cream cheese, just saying it's more than what I am used to seeing on a menu.   Finish off with cucumber salad, refreshing...then some ice cream (which was average) or mochi ice cream!",

As of the last several months, the times we have gone in there - it's been not so great.  The service is slow, trying to get refills on drinks is a joke, ordering rolls & having them forgotten, getting the wrong rolls, etc.    The food is good - that's what keeps the rating from dropping lower.  I love the Son of a Beach roll.  The gyoza is super tasty.  The mochi often comes out so frozen that you have to let it sit for a few before eating it otherwise it's a struggle (I know - first world problem).    The price is just right for AYCE...I just wish the service was better.",

Great sushi is not Fresh or too aged but this place is a great balance, Since i eat here a lot i have noticed difference at times. The first thing I order when I sit down is the Seafood Salad, That is eff'in awesome must have it and it is included in the AYCE.

I used to love this place and made a point to come here every time I visited Vegas. For  under $30, AYCE sushi rolls is tough to top, and I guess something had to finally give at Yama. The quality truly is noticeably worse and the rolls are now stuffed with a higher rice to fish ratio. To make matters worse, even the sushi rice quality seemed to have declined as both the texture and flavor are subpar.   On prior visits, I would have given Yama four stars, but based on my most recent visit, I can't give it more than two. Hopefully, they bounce back and I can edit this review later.",

I've given it a try a couple times since it's near UNLV and cheaper than most AYCE places but nothing redeems this place of how below-average the sushi and service is. This place is crowded often but don't let it fool you, it's in a crowded area plus it's near the strip. The sushi is terrible. Their rice is always falling apart and the fish never tastes fresh. Plus their service is flat out rude. And if you don't want to take my word for it then take the Health District's word for it. THEY GOT CLOSED IN JUNE TWICE FOR FAILING THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION. And have gotten numerous C's in the past, many times getting over 30 demerits. Google it.  The last time I went, when my friend and I arrived the hostess seemed peeved we were waiting for the rest of our party. We didn't even insist we sit down at a table but she had attitude about us waiting. When we got to our table it was 2:50 and they tried to charge us dinner prices which we had to fight them about. (And who wants to do that?) If your menu has lunch prices till 3PM then it's lunch prices till 3PM. Its not a hard concept. It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price. Okay fine, take your extra 3 dollars you crazy people.  Then we ate and I definitely didn't eat my moneys worth. Sushi looks like it's from a grocery store. Nothing special, tastes old.  I'm sorry but when your sushi is gross don't be so determined to charge the higher price. They were rude about the whole process too and like I said, the sushi sucks.  The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway. This business does not know how to pick their battles or treat their customers. It's scary going to a sushi place like this because they WILL argue you for more money, even when they're clearly in the wrong.   Sakana across the street is much better and relatively the same prices.",

It has about the cheapest AYCE that I have seen (22.99$) and they other lots of different kinds of rolls, appetizers, and the sushi is FRESH :) The staff is also very friendly and attentive, which I really like in an AYCE place as I frequently want to order more and more and more.. AND they double check your order   Unlike some other AYCE sushi places they offer hamachi kama (and salmon kama too!) this is one of my favorite dishes and it is certainly delicious ::drools:: I like to take the lemon from my water and spurt some citrousy goodness on it, but that's just me. The agedashi tofu its ehh, the batter around it is kind of rubbery and hard to eat after its been in the sauce for... well right when it was delivered. They might not offer as many appetizer as other AYCE places (Oyshi sushi) but they offer a different variety and it is tasty.  The sushi is very fresh and the cuts of fish are large. I LOVE the albacore, it melts in your mouth and it had just a dash of siracha. The yellowtail, garlic tuna and giant clam are also super yummy.  The ice cream is quite good as well! They offer red bean, green tea, and plum. They also have mochi :d  If you're thinking about getting AYCE sushi try this place out! The food will not disappoint. However, it is kind of crowded and usually busy so if you're not into that type of atmosphere be warned. They have one large room for big groups so if you have one they can accommodate you, but you'll probably need a reservation. Happy eating!!",

    "text": "whoever thought the idea of all you can eat sushi would be a good idea was an idiot. a group of 18 and i went to Yama at 2pm for AYCE sushi. at least half of us were hungover, so the thought of scarfing down roll after roll didn't sound that appealing to me. but i'm never one to turn down a buffet opportunity so i gave in.  i was so confused about the ordering process of the place. i totally imagined a bar with tons of different types of sushi that we can pick up ourselves. instead, we filled out the menus, which were then sent to the sushi chefs ... i think there were at least 3, to be made. for a sushi buffet, i was impressed that they still made their food fresh. there were so many different types of rolls, as well as their own concocted ones, which had really interesting, yet inappropriate names to it.   one of my friends ordered the wet dream (that was really sweet), and other rolls donned names like who's yo daddy and happy ending and more nasty names that i wish i remembered. i had the harry potter, which had tuna on top and was a cucumber roll.   the buffet also extended to appetizers and desserts. the seafood salad was awesome and our table was filled with different flavors of mochi (vanilla, strawberry, mango, and like 3 more flavors) and ice cream (green tea, red bean, plum!!!) by the end of the meal. also, everyone lost track of what they ordered, so we all ended up taking a roll or two and passing it down the table. so i had no idea what i was eating most of the meal. eventually all the rolls began to look and taste the same. some had different names but was identical in ingredients.   it got really bad by the end because all the rolls came first and then the sushi. we ended up with like 6 full plates of salmon and the same amount of tuna that everyone claims they didn't order. the rule was that we had to finish everything, or else we had to pay for everything we ordered at individual prices, which would have cost a fortune. thankfully my table had some eaters and we were able to demolish most of the sushi and rolls.   considering how the sushi is intended for buffet use, with lesser quality of ingredients, everything was still really good. definitely worth the $22.99 for AYCE sushi.  and major props to our two or three waitresses accommodating a 19 person group. :)  would i do it again? yes! but give me a few months to recover :)",

She even made us eat or we will pay I know that the rule and it's ok when she tried reminding us she said it in a rude way. The last time I ate there I stopped eating there for like 5-7 month,  the last time there she did the same thing. This time she did the same thing again but now worst she as if we were the half and half family **** she. She not allow to say that.",

I went with the \"All You Can Eat\" and it was so worth it, since I normally run away from the concept. I can't remember what rolls I had but I started with the Seafood Salad which I'll recommend to anyone. It's spicy, tangy and yummy! The chefs really know how to blend flavors. Yama is about 15 minutes away from the strip but it's so worth the cab ride. I'd recommend this place to anyone heading to Vegas.",

    "text": "There were quite a few FOB Japanese eating there, which usually a good sign that it'll be good. Super cute little hole in the wall, hidden in a really ghetto strip mall. Tourists pls note that this isn't the best area of town, so I be sure to lock your car door. It's next to a grocery store, so the parking lot should be pretty well lit at least.   My friend wasn't familiar with all you can eat, and felt a little pressured by the waitress to order quickly and not ask questions. But overall service was really attentive, and nice that the waitresses were speaking to each other in Japanese (meaning theyr'e not Korean run like most sushi places lately).    I may have found a new fav sushi place, although it's mainly based off of the awesomeness of a couple specific items. The menu had a decent selection of nigiri and specialty rolls, didn't have as much variety on sides as most other places. I could taste the vinegar in the rice more than others, some people like that, I'm not a huge fan. The nigiri and specialty rolls we tried were just so so, but I would go back soley for the salmon kama (grilled collar), the amaebi (sweet shrimp), and the ice cream.   I've had salmon and hamachi collar at sushi mon and island sushi, it was good, but nothing special. The salmon collar at Yama was probably the best salmon I've ever had. It had quite a bit of meat still on it, grilled to be really crispy on the outside, so rich and perfectly cooked on the inside. With the lemon and whatever sauce they give you on the side it was just heaven. Salmon collar on it's own is already $9 so you may as well just get the ayce.    Amaebi wasn't served as nigiri sushi - it was just the raw shrimp on its own w/out rice. Sweet, and texture was firm not mushy like it often is. I ordered it with the head, which was freshly fried - crispy, yum.   You can order more than 1 ice cream if you want. They also had variety of mochi ice cream flavors instead of just vanilla, strawberry - they had chocolate, mango, etc. The green tea ice cream was also the best my friend and I had ever had. It's store bought, not housemade but for some reason it stood out from the green teas I've had in the past. It was creamy and you could really taste the green tea.   Especially factoring the cheap dinner price, I'll definitely be back here sometime soon.",

And you're not limited to one order of ice cream :)   I recommend this place, but do come before the dinner rush. Once I got outside there seemed to be around 20 people waiting to be seated.",

There are some rules about not ordering more than a couple of rolls at a time. Appetizers are included, and some items (probably due to expense) are you-get-one-only.   This said, all the rolls were uniformly delicious and well prepared, and fresh. The crab is real crab.   Service is generally pretty good. When they get slammed, things can slip, but they're easily reminded you're waiting for something. It was a good experience. Not super-stellar, but pretty good. I'll probably return. Go hungry. Go with friends. It's about $25 for AYCE.",

Their fish is really fresh and I love their 1:1 fish to rice ratio. After going to another ayce restaurant (*cough* Goyeman), this place is a holy grail. At Goyeman, the rice was 3x more than the actual fish in a nigiri (we even have pictures) and all of the servers are either unbelievably stupid or have zero knowledge on what sushi is supposed to look like. Even one the chefs came over to personally apologize to us and told us that he was so embarrassed to see the ratio we were given. Anyways, this review isn't supposed to be a rant about how terrible Goyeman was lol Service was quick, friendly, and attentive. We get our orders out almost immediately even though we order A LOT of nigiris at once. Their uni is really fresh and I recommend trying their white tuna. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking to satisfy your sushi cravings in large quantities since their fish is really fresh, the provide good portions, and service is very quick. They are almost always busy as well, however I prefer this location way more than their other location since parking is easier to find.",

This is one of the best AYCE sushi spots I've ever had not just in Las Vegas but anywhere. We stick to mostly the Nigiri which is a significant portion of fish to rice, and the rainbow roll is a winner. The Sake specials are pretty good and I would say for $30 you can't get a better deal for a meal.",

There's decent parking since it's at a strip mall.  I would recommend the sashimi salad since you get a lot of fish and the uni (too bad both are only 1 per customer).  Also, soft shell crab is always good. I think just getting those 3 above gets you your money back, everything else you order is money well spent.  There can be a wait so try to get there before the lunch / dinner rush.  As a comparison, we went on 12/23 at about 5pm and the only free seats were at the bar.",

For example, you can order udon, yakitori, and other appetizers along with some rolls.   Everything I tried was okay. The rolls were somewhat underwhelming. The fish quality was just okay and the sushi rice, to be honest, wasn't very good. But I guess for $24 AYCE I can't be too upset about it. The service was good, and the waitresses constantly made sure we had everything we needed and that our waters were refilled. I just wish the sushi was better, because after the first two rolls I didn't want to order any more, so I just stuck to the nigiri.",

    "text": "All you can eat sushi... that's right. Located a hop, skip and a jump from the LV strip in a local strip mall makes this a gem of a spot for sushi lovers. There is another location on the other side of town. For the price you would pay for about 2 rolls, you can get all you can eat soup, salad, appetizers, sushi and ice cream. Not just any sushi but a menu filled with dozens of specialty rolls that you won't find many other places. My favorite apps are the shrimp tempura, soft shell crab, teriyaki chicken and the miso soup. Favorite rolls are the shrimp lovers roll, Baby one more time, double dragon and the wet dream roll baked with cream cheese. Yum!   Service is efficient and the food comes out quick. A few things to note are that ther is no sharing allowed, you have to eat the whole roll including the rice and you will be charged extra for food with large quantities left over. So order small amounts, go slow and if you're starting to feel full but still want to try something ask for a half roll.    This place is popular and can get busy at times. So understand that there may be a wait. But it is so worth it.",

You can't beat the price for the quality of sushi they serve! We ordered the Eat-All-You-Can Dinner for $25.00, and it INCLUDED Uni, Toro AND Ikura!! Where else can you get this kind of a deal?! We were only allowed one order of uni, but the fact that it was included blew our minds.  It really is worth the wait to get this much good food for $25. You simply cannot complain about \"slow\" service because you can't have it all. Remember the most basic restaurant characteristic choices you have - \"Price / Quality / Service...Pick TWO\". If you put more value in fast service, go to a fast food restaurant. OR... you can do what we did. We sat at the counter. Food came quickly because the itamae-san was right in front of us and we could directly tell him what we wanted.",

We got seated right upon entering during lunch, it wasn't too full while we were there, and it was kind of nice as it is very narrow walking through the area and seating was a bit tight also.  This place was okay, heard a lot about it, but once my coworker and I ate there our first and only time thus far, we weren't blown away by anything out of the ordinary for all the hype heard, not the sushi nor the decor truly stood out.. It wasn't bad, just not a favorite, I had a few good rolls, though there lacked creativity in the combinations, most of them seemed repetitive, with lots of salmon and cream cheese, the fish variety was decent, service wasn't bad either rolls were brought out fairly quick, our check took a bit to arrive but it was fine, overall just left us a bit unsatisfied though full, but I don't think I'll be back in a while as I rather go to Sakana if I'm in this area in all honesty.",

Poor sushi rice is a tough knock against an all you can eat restaurant that requires you to eat the rice when you order nigiri. Somewhere between mushy and crusty, this sushi rice was not anywhere close to correct or enjoyable.  Fish was variable. Salmon (farmed) was fresh, Maguro was pleasant yet unremarkable, hamachi good, Unagi reasonable.  Scallops were a miss. I have a suspicion that they had been frozen for a good long while before finding the plate due to their strange, watery texture.  Tempura prawns were limp and just unfortunate. Not close to crisp and hot out of the fryer.   All in all, I found this experience underwhelming and not really the best value. A select couple of nice cuts of fish saved my lunch from being terrible.  Service was better than the food.",

    "text": "Place has been pretty good for sushi when I have gone out with my coworkers, but I think quality has been hit or miss.I was greeted right away and asked for a table since the bar was full. As I passed by for a possible table of 4, I was parked in a corner right up next to the cash register. Tight. I was worried my co-worker would have to squeeze into their seat and sure enough it was. I asked about the empty table that we walked by earlier, but that was only for four people. Oh well, we were both too hungry to be too picky. Had the all you can eat sushi lunch as usual and it started pretty good. Ordered the Seafood Salad in both spicy and mild. It's basically all fish without the rice. Nice, but you get only one order per person with AYCE. The spicy Seafood Salad was a little too spicy for me, but the mild was much better. Ordered the Harry Potter roll and that was my least favorite. No real outstanding flavor and the fish did not taste sushi quality. The more simple sushi options like tuna, salmon, and whit tuna rolls were better than the Harry Potter on, but still not getting that really clean ocean taste that I have had here before. Plenty of servers though. So I was able to get service pretty quick, although me sitting right next to the register might have something to do with it as different severs had to close out checks and tables. A plus maybe? The Eel handroll, had rice, cucumbers, avocado, and eel. One of my avocado slice still had the skin on as I was eating it. Boo. My coworker said her Eel handroll was fine though.   Overall, service here is good and friendly. I would come back for the Seafood Salad alone as that was the freshest tasting item we had. Unfortunately, my friend and I did not feel well after our lunch and concluded it's from the not also fresh batch of rolls we had last. My friend said may not come back, but I might give it another try at a later date in hopes today was an off day.",

I just commented to a friend the other day how we've been eating Yama for over 10 years now, and the food is always the same. I've never eaten here and had a bad meal. I love that when you get AYCE, you can get the whole menu at anytime. I love the seafood salad, sun of the beach roll, and the wet dream roll. The rolls are pretty saucy, so if you're not into that I would say skip this place.   The seafood salad is unlike anything I've been able to find. There is no lettuce in this salad. It's a few different types of sashimi with mild or spicy ponzu sauce and sliced radish. It is seriously the best salad I've ever had. Yama gives one seafood salad per person with AYCE which is a steal because ala carte it's like $12. Yes this place is busy and small, but they must be doing something right. Lunch is $21.95 and dinner is $24.95. They are going to open a Yama 2 soon, so be on the lookout for that.",

Everything was relatively fresh. The service was great. The all you can eat menu is extensive and there are a lot of delicious things to be had on there along with nigiri. The only downfall to all you can eat is that if you don't eat what you order, they charge you for what's left over, but that's not a problem for us as we are sushi hounds.

If you peace yourself by the time they come around to get your order again you will most likely be full. This way you get to experience the food more. Another tio is any roll can be ordered as a half roll. The fish was just outstanding. The rolls delicious and the everything on their huge menu is part of the ayce. This place is amazing. I do wish I lived closer to Vegas. My wife and I love everything ate. We will be coming back here everytime we are in Vegas.

After our party of 3 was sat at a 2 top and asked to deal with it I was already annoyed.  After ordering and having our drinks brought to us, we were asked to stand up and move.  We initially thought \"Great! They are moving us to a larger table!\"  Too bad that wasn't the case.  Instead they had us move to another to a 2 top table!!!! Are you kidding me?!?! Then after my boyfriend got his food he and finished 3 pops he found a dead fly embedded into his lemon.  They tried to claim it came in from outside and landed on their food therefore it's not their problem.  WTF kind of thinking is that?!?!!!! They refused to comp his food, and only offered to take it off his drink order.  Calling Health Department now!  We canceled my order before it even got to the table.",

This was all you can eat sushi for under $30...more like closer to $25.  There is no way that you would be able to find this kind of quality of fish in Hawaii for all you can eat for this price.  It's not only sushi that's on the all you can eat menu, they have edamame, chicken, beef, tonkatsu, tempura, SASHIMI. Say what?  All you can eat sashimi?  No way!   Of course you can also order off of their regular dinner menu also which is very reasonable.    If we lived in Vegas I would be going there every month.  If you are a vegas local, I would highly suggest you try this place at least once.  It's a great place for all types of groups, families, couples.  Parking...free and plenty of it.",

What's really good is the salmon and other fish collar that is underneath the appetizer section. Other than those two items, you can find the typical menu items that you usually find in any sushi place. Dessert also comes with AYCE with a choice of one mochi ice cream ball or a scoop of regular ice cream.  My only complaint about this place is the location. Every time I've been here, I've either seen people get into fights, couples cussing each other out, or have a ton of shady people approach you for money.

Not only that but the rice is disgusting.  So wet and soggy taste like I would imagine old bath water would taste like. Barley any fish at all some pieces were all 100% rice wrapped up.  It was so bad we had to return all 6 rolls and we refused to eat or pay for them until the waitress tried it. She argued with us saying this was sushi rice, When she did finally try it.  She returned it and said sorry would we like different rolls.  Wtf no way we don't want anything with that nasty rice.    Service was horrible, waitress lost our order, and forgot everything we asked for and had to ask her several times to get what we needed.  We ordered a sprite 2x and both times got tonic or soda water.  We had to make them taste that too because they thought we were lying.  When they realized they tried to offer us free soda.  Lol at this point we now are in pure hatred of this place.    The only reason I give 1 stars is because it won't allow me to go lower and it might deserve 1, the only dishes that were good were  Short ribs and seafood salad, and soft shell crab appetizers.

You can order half rolls to in order to be able to try more rolls without having to eat any entire roll.  Some items can only be ordered once per person (denoted by a red heart), but it's not a big deal.

Our group goes once a month; we know exactly what we order every time, so it's not like we're wasting their time being chatty and indecisive.  I'm actually pretty conscious of waitstaff and understand how rude it would be to hold up their next table -- for their tip, and for the people waiting in line.  But Yama takes this to a whole new level.  It's bad enough they often stick you in the most cramped, traffic-bumping aisle ways possible.  Many a groin have brushed our table as people try to squeeze past to their seats around us.  The staff have even literally lifted the table next to us, up and over us, to fit more seats somewhere else.  If they could fit a 2-seater in the entrance vestibule where people wait for their table, I'm sure they would.  I'm surprised they haven't removed the hostess stand to fit a folding chair and TV tray for solo diners.  From the time we sit down, to when we're finishing our last roll, is about 30 minutes -- which feels pretty efficient in my mind.  But at that point, they will come clear away all dishes and drop the check.  While you're thinking about dessert, they come clear the papers and napkins, and 60 seconds later, they come make a show of wiping your table while you're still sitting there.  90 seconds later, they come ask if you need anything else, and clear the menus.  45 seconds later, they come take the soy sauce.  If you have the audacity to sit any longer, they come make a show of wiping your bare table a second time.  Sometimes people need a little nudge to get moving, but sometimes it seriously feels like we're being punked, and these ladies could not be hinting any harder.  There are too many great sushi places in this town to be cramped and shushed away like Yama does!",

This is nice because you don't have to deal with the drunk tourists who wander around. It can get extremely crowded, and if you have a large party you will probably have to work. It's worth it!  The rolls are delicious and fresh. If you like Uni, this is the place to go. You can only get one order per person though so make it count!  For rolls, I recommend the Man Whore and Salmon Loves Lemon rolls. They do have a lot of choices though, so there is something for everyone. I try to try a new roll every time. You can even order a half roll which can be the perfect size when you are starting to get full!   I'm sad that I moved away from Las Vegas and won't get to eat at Yama. But I'll make sure to stop by every time I'm there!",

Don't get me wrong, I like the sauce, but they have been putting WAY TOO MUCH on the rolls as of late. I often find myself scraping goops of mayo off of my sushi before I eat it now.

For those pricy items allow 1 order per person, such as uni, sweet shrimp, & the sweet shrimps are extremely tiny!!!! very disappointed!!!  the rest of the sushi are just ok... the waitress enforced u to finish the rice otherwise they will charge u with the sashimi price!!! how mean.... totally lost the meaning of All-U-Can-Eat!!! btw, our waitress is very rude too.  i do love the mochi ice cream !! it was my bday they created a mochi ice cream bday cake for me.. it was cute & nice~~  thats why i gave this place 3/5.... otherwise it worth 2/5 only....",

I had friends visiting ones that not so much yelpers yelpers but enjoy reading reviews and notice the four stars never been so wanted too give it try. Hell yay! Really all about hanging out with family/friends in life.   We went early since it was holiday weekend plus went on friday night. My friends arrived earlier since it on the opposite town for me. Talk about making first impression is that they let my friends sit down before I arrived. I know some of my favorite sushi spots they won't let you sit down if whole party not together. Once we got sat down looking at the menu really not much different then any other AYCE. I am not much into the speciality rolls more of nigiri. Talk about nice size portion of fish on the nigiri. My taste actually not good thing or my sushi spots non of them cut the fish that thick. I understand people thinking more fish getting better deal looks better. The thing I found at Yama is bigger or thicker cuts not always mean better. I felt like the quality of the fish, and just the overall freshness very blah average at best. The sushi rice was really sub par for me. It lacked any kind of vinegar or just felt like plain rice. Since I had no idea that the fish was cut on the thicker side ordered 12 orders of nigiri too start thinking good kick start. Our waitress like yay that lot. True cause after that had no room too try more of the menu more less any speciality rolls. I did get in green tea ice cream. Good. Again had better at other sushi restaurants. Overall since such competitive market of AYCE and Yama on the opposite side of town stick too the ones I like best.  The service was great definitely four stars comes too never have empty glass. Talk about bringing out the sushi. I was surprise how fast our first round came out between the three of us ordering good round.",

The first time I came here was summer '11 & things haven't changed one bit!  This past weekend, my bf and I arrived from a long drive and decided to start our trip off with some delicious sushi.  Although we love to eat, our tummies cannot take that much food... but this time we decided other wise.  Lunch buffet for $20/each -- best choice we made this whole trip!  The rolls we decided to order this time were:  spicy sexy roll (we LOVE spicy foods and this roll in particular will leave your mouth on fiyah!!), you the man too!!, snow in vegas (this one was ehh... the sauce was too sweet for our tastebuds), strip tease (super yummy), Philadelphia roll (x2) and a salmon skin hand-roll.  I also got two orders of miso soup for myself & he got an order of muscles and gyoza.  The food here is amazing & service is pretty good as well.  Can't wait to go back!",

For around $27 per person, it's not going to break the bank and like most AYCE places, it's everything included.. Rolls, hand rolls, Sashimi, Nigiri, Dessert... Beer and adult beverages are additional, but I don't often partake in Day drinking after the gym.. though it's been know to happen.. OK maybe ONE beer... for the carbs..  Anyway, it's near UNLV and as a result seems to be popular with the local student population, and it's popular with my group of friends too. check it out.  Happy Eating!",

    "text": "I arrived at 4:30pm and they were already starting to take names for a waiting list. The other option (which I choose and highly recommend) is to sit at the sushi bar. Since you have the option of all you can eat or not it doesn't matter. You just flip the menu over to all you can eat menu and go crazy--asking your sushi chef to make whatever you choose. They also came around asking if I wanted appetizers which I had some Miso Soup and tempura shrimp which arrived after my first tray of sushi had already been made by my sushi chef. He wasn't really just mine but as I was sitting at one corner of the sushi bar, the chef that served my area was alert to any orders that were verbally tossed in his direction. Excellent, well prepared and very artistic looking--something you really wouldn't think about being in the middle of the desert but it is True what others have raved about. The Seafood Salad is a must. This truly is good food! Wet Dreams is for connaisseurs.  Sushi is by far, my favorite meal and it is safe to say I look for the all-you-can eat places in each city I go to, simply because I like to eat a lot of it! This would have to rank in the top 5 for sure--go figure.. I still can't believe it--for being a land-locked location.  Knowing when I have reached my limit of sushi,I stopped to allow room for some Japanese Ice cream and mochi ball which is also included in this menu..   It was almost 2 hours later when I was walking out of the place. Or should I say \"rolling out\" of this place and there were probably 30 people outside waiting to get in. I truly picked the perfect time to go for my meal. The night is still young, not that this matters in a place like Vegas, but if I don't do anything else worth while I know that at least my tummy is happy!",

Immediately before we sat our waiter got our order of drinks and got to our table before we ordered.  Yes, finally water service!   One of their famous rolls: Sun of the beach it came out hot and fresh. It was a new sensation for me. If you look on the menu the names are only what you will find in Vegas.  \"One minute man\"  \"Wet dreams\"   All in which, made me laugh with my friends.  It was definitely a great conversation to start with.   Especially when deciding what rolls we like to try.  HAHAHhahah.  ONE GOOD THING!!  The rolls are not overpowered by fillers such as crabmeat and Philadelphia cheese.  In this case maintains their five star rating with me.  Also, I love how attentive the waiters were with keeping our glasses full with water and our table with sushi orders.

The 4 rolls we started our order with came at LIGHTNING speed, but the taste was....meh.. To me, it tasted less fresh and more refrigerated.    It seems a lot of the reviews swear by it, but maybe it was my mood that day, but it just seemed very \"meh\" to me.

The fish is always fresh.  Service is great too, you can flag any server down that walks by and they will help you out.

But in my opinion, Yama just isn't good.  The restaurant is small.  The service is absolutely horrendous.  I never know who is my actual server or who to order anything from.  They're super strict on their AYCE rules.  And the freshness and quality of ingredients are questionable.    I love baked rolls. And I love cream cheese.  And when I order a baked roll and it comes out room temp, the cream cheese isn't even melted in, and the roll falls apart when I start picking it up with my chopsticks, I'm just sad.  I've given Yama multiple chances to prove me wrong. But each time I decide to go back, they just reaffirm that they're just not that good.  No changes in service, no improvements in quality of food.  Just an overall sad experience.  It's not the absolute worst I've ever had, but it's still very sad.  Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else if you're a real sushi lover looking for quality rolls, fresh ingredients, and a great experience.",

Expect to wait maybe 45 mins-1 hour plus on weekends, there is ALWAYS a line if you go for dinner, granted that is a good sign!  Some of my favorites are: The seafood salad, no name roll, who's your daddy, wet dream and I like to polish it off with cucumber salad, edamame, miso and of course-MOCHI!  The fresh cuts are just that, FRESH, and the variety of dishes is quite remarkable.  Overall, if you plan on eating around 8PM on the weekend, try to arrive at least around 7PM. For lunch there is really no waiting time to speak of.  Yama Sushi-a diamond in the rough, referring to the strip mall it's located in. You will not be disappointed.",

The specialty rolls are amazing and I've found the quality to be consistently excellent over the past three years.  The prices are reasonable.  The biggest problem is that it often takes a while to get in due to the popularity of the restaurant.  (Do try the \"Man Whore\" baked roll.  Wow!)   The restaurant is located in the Albertson's shopping center at Flamingo and Maryland Parkway, making it very convenient for those of us on the East side of town.  Parking is easy.  During prime hours it can be tough to get in with a large group unless you're ready to wait.  It's worth the wait.  The place has been spotless every time I've been there and I've yet to ever see it empty, even in the middle of a weekday.",

The quality was surprisingly very fresh for AYCE and includes many special rolls which were tempting to order, but after just one roll, we just couldn't do it.   My favorite item I usually order  is a crunchy hand roll and they got the crispy part done right, but it was overwhelmingly drenched in eel sauce resulting in it being a sickeningly sweet and overloaded rice roll. The service was definitely lacking, you get ice cream or mochi at the end of you meal, and it took 20 minutes for the check and another 20 just to get our green tea ice cream. 40 freaking minutes to get out of there despite reminding two different waitresses 4 times!!! Throughout our meals, we had to request for more water, our rolls, and napkins several times. So the price and quality of the fish is decent, large selection of special rolls, but if you want to get full, just order one hand or special roll and you're set.",

    "text": "Ok, maybe I'm spoiled with Sushi Mon and Goyemon, but this place was horrible! I would have given it no stars, but they did serve fried soft shell crab a la carte.   Wait is ridiculously long, and service sucked. My boyfriend and I both did the AYCE option. I ordered 2 orders of our usual such as uni, sweet shrimp, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, eel, scallop, etc. I paid attention to the menu as it said \"each order has 2 pieces.\"  What comes out 20 minutes later?  2 pieces of each fish I ordered, I was expecting 4 pieces. After we ate everything in about 5 mintues, we had to wait another 10 before our waitress came back. She just ignored our empty plates, maybe she was hoping we wouldn't want anything else and we would leave. I asked her about the other half of our order, like were they saving that for a 2nd round or something? And she said, no, each order is one piece, so at this point i'm confused and pull out the menu that says each order has 2 pieces. She said the menu was wrong and we only get 1 piece. So at this point I reorder everything and ask for 2 more orders of soft shell crab. I still only get one. I wonder if she thought I was the only one eating as I was the only one ordering.   The only two good items was the fresh yellowtail and the the soft shell crab a la carte. The other sushi items were so so, the scallop was not good, and the shrimp heads were so tough, the exoskeleton wasn't even fried completely so it made for a very tough to chew and cut up your mouth bite.   This place seemed so popular with a 30 minute wait on friday night, but maybe it's their regular menu that's good. It doesn't matter, as I won't be back.",

I thought it was a gimmick (because EVERY other sushi place only has a handful of lame things for all you can eat) but I was blown away when EVERYTHING on the damn menu is all you can eat.  I had the seafood salad, the bomb.  Wow.  Lots of flavors and good portion.  The no name roll was pretty bomb also.  Everything I ate was impressive.  I really liked this place.  The service was excellent and I really didn't have any complaints.  Even their house sake was pretty good.  Next time I come here, I am going to bring my peeps.

Not a limited menu either, their ENTIRE menu is offered- apps, sushi, sashimi, dessert! Oh, except for your drink of choice... Unless you like water from Lake Mead w/ a side of lemon if you're feeling fancy, then that is free.   Some inside info & tips:  -They do not take reservations and the secret is out for this gem, so expect a long wait.  - After the waitress thinks you've had enough food, you'll notice she'll start to disappear.. Just learn her name and then she'll have to respond!  - Make sure you double check your bill. On a couple of occasions my bill has been incorrect.  - This place is VERY small and kinda crammed- Not very good for kids.  - You cannot go wrong for any of their specialty rolls- all are amazing!!  - DON'T leave without trying the Seafood Salad!!!!!!!!",

The staff was ATTENTIVE and checked back often to take away our used dishes. Whenever we asked for something (ponzu sauce, more water, more food, etc) it arrived quickly. The only complaint I have was that sometimes good we didn't order arrived at our table instead of the table that ordered it. Luckily we all had the all you can eat so it didn't matter much.

I appreciate the variety of cooked/cold (raw) rolls. My love for cream  cheese runs deep and I have SO many cream cheese filled rolls to pick from it's perfect! We usually sit at a table but this time we went for the bar, I have to say I like the bar better(except for the idiot and his girlfriend with spilled sushi all over seated next to us, but I digress) My favorites are always the Harry Potter, Wet Dream, Be Mine,  and Yo Sexy.

It might look a bit sketch, but the food here is amazing. I always get the nigiri and some handrolls. My girlfriend opts for their sushi rolls and nigiri. Service here is also good. Waitresses are always attentive to your needs.   A must-try is their Palm Job handroll. It's only limited to 1 per customer. I also get the other items that are restricted to 1 per person such as uni. Bonus: if your significant other does not eat it, you'd get 2 orders! #win",

Secondly, the service was rather UNORGANIZED, I  was asked several times by different servers what I ordered. That got annoying fast, making conversation hard to keep up when your constantly being interrupted.Which I don't blame on the servers themselves,more on management. I stuck to giving my order to one waitress. I of course wanted to give her a tip, and left the appropriate amount and before my party even left someone else picked up the tip.  And lastly the food didn't seem quality. I've tried a few other places around town and this place left my stomach turning.",

    "text": "Decided to try a Japanese buffet in vegas, as buffets on the strip has sky rocketing prices for mediocre food now a days.   I looked up many different ayce restaurants, and decided to pick the one with over 1000+ reviews for our first ayce Japanese buffet in vegas.   Arrived at around 8:30 and it was packed, we had to wait, but it wasn't long since we elected to sit at the sushi bar if it became available.  And I'm so glad we did that.    I'm used to Toronto Japanese buffets where you order everything all at once.  It was a different vibe here.  We sat down, and the sushi chef was making sushi and just asked what we would like. So I literally just listed a couple of nigiri (uni, sweet shrimp, ikura, giant clam).  Jose was the sushi chef and he acknowledged my order while making other rolls for other people.  He didn't write anything down.  And in 5 minutes he created the masterpiece!!   Just like other yelpers said, the sashimi salad is a must get!! Lots of sashimi, crunchy radish straws, a shrimp tempura in a nice vinaigrette.  We got it mild and it was perfect with a touch of spice.   The uni didn't have too much flavour, but the ikura were huge and explodes in your mouth when putting the piece into your mouth.  The giant clam, I didn't know what made it so pricey and premium. The sweet shrimp didn't come with rice and came with the shrimp heads fried.   We tried some half rolls, we wanted to try many things, but was getting full from the rice.  Had a palm job hand roll and that was really good.    Ordered the Hamachi kama and it was a little over cooked.  They forgot our order so I had to ask them twice to check up on it.  It finally came after 30 minutes piping hot, so maybe that's why it was over cooked.   Had a strawberry and mango mochi along with a scoop of red bean, green tea and plum ice cream. I've never had plum ice cream before but it was really good!!   Very much enjoyed my experience here, definitely different from Toronto in the selection of foods.  They don't offer too many cooked foods from the kitchen, but are more geared towards specialty rolls and nigiri.",

But when we try to order the tuna poke and the salmon poke at the same time. We were told \"NO\" you are not allowed. Only one or the other. I asked him then why doesn't it specified that on the menu. Because they are separated on the menu. No reply. He just grin and repeat that we can only pick one of the two.

    "text": "All-you-can-eat nigiri, rolls, special rolls, appetizers, and desserts.  Unlike buffets, everything is brought to the table after you order.  There's three rules at Yama.  One, sashimi isn't all-you-can-eat.  Two, don't waste your rice or you'll pay for it.  Three, don't share with your friend who isn't doing AYCE.  Do I need to say more?  I went to Yama Sushi after running the Las Vegas half marathon with my friends.  The restaurant is cozy - you can sit at tables or you can sit at the sushi bar.  As mentioned, everything on the menu besides sashimi is fair game for all-you-can-eat.  So, in addition to eating over 20 pieces of sushi, I also ate gyoza, pork katsu, miso soup, and green tea ice cream for dessert.  The salmon nigiri was excellent.  I'd mention and recommend specific rolls, but my table ordered so many that I lost track of what I ate.  If the sushi was fixed portion, I'd give it four stars.  But, it's absurd to complain when you can order unlimited amounts of both the California rolls and the rolls loaded with crab, several types of fish, eel, and special sauces.  Price for dinner AYCE is around $25 plus tip.  On the Strip for dinner, that'll only buy you a burger and a soda in some places.  The only downside is that it's a bit of a drive to get here from Downtown Vegas.  When you add your Uber, you're paying the same as if you just ate dinner in the Bellagio.  Do I regret coming here though to satisfy my sushi craving after burning 1,000 calories?  Definitely not.",

As previously stated, I am a sushi snob, so not sure why I decided to try AYCE, only that it was convenient at the time. Ok. I think that maybe AYCE sushi should exist in its own realm and should not be compared to non-AYCE establishments. Ya know, if you go to Japan, these things that pass for \"sushi\" do not exist there (i.e. rolls with cream cheese, etc.) We tried a few nigiri (white tuna, salmon, unagi, uni, and salmon) to get the ball rolling and ordered one roll. The rice was shockingly WRONG. All wrong. That is not how sushi rice is made. The texture and consistency was all off. Rice was balled up tight and hard and too much vinegar.  The rolls were passable, but then I really can't deal with rolls when it comes to sushi, so maybe its unfair for me to rate this at all....

    "text": "Let me start off by saying Yama used to be my go to sushi spot in Vegas.. Well that changed a long time ago but I still decided to try it out again and I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.  Every time we place an order it was about 3 to 5 items and each time they forgot at least 1 item so the entire time I was constantly asking for something that was previously ordered. The sushi has gone so far down hill with portion size and quality and was lacking flavor in ever item. After the 3rd time asking then for a side order of teriyaki chicken for my 2 kids to eat they finally brought it and by that time they weren't hungry any more which was a good thing because after eating a piece myself that tasted undercooked I decided to check the rest of it and it was completely raw. It takes a special kind of person to cook a paper thin piece of chicken medium rare (and calling it mid rare is being generous because it was hardly seared). If the service was good it would of made up for the food being horrible but that wasn't the case at all because service sucked. Thank you Yama for permanently crossing yourself off of my list of places to dine and recommend. I'm a chef on the Las Vegas strip and a highly respected restaurant and will usually forgive a place for bad experience but not this time.  Sakana right across the street blows you guys out of the water",

The option to order half rolls is amazing as it let's one taste a few different rolls without over eating. The wet dream and super cali are my favorite rolls as well as the rainbow roll. The fried soft shell crab and garlic spicy edamame  is a must.The only thing is the area of the location  over the years has become a little questionable at times.  My bestie took her mom who was visiting from Atlanta and there were drug addicts in the parking lot.  Kind of made them a little nervous but they still loved their food.",

Pricing is on par with most other AYCE sushi spots in vegas, and the fish was mostly fresh.   Definitely start with the seafood salad! Nigiri was okay- scallop tasted like it had gone bad, garlic tuna did not taste like garlic at all. The rolls had too many sauces, and too much of them for my liking, but I do like that you can order by the half-roll. The Son of the Beach, Oh My Harry, and Ellen rolls (ordered based on multiple mentions in reviews) didn't blow my mind like some people claimed they would. The Palm Job hand roll was decent, wish they had a few more special hand rolls. Avoid the plum ice cream for dessert- tasted super artificial, more like bubblegum than any fruit flavor.  Service was initially pretty quick sitting at the bar, then the sushi chef started forgetting items. I don't know if the rolls are generally oversauced or if it was just the guy making them for us. Not a place I'd go out of my way to return to, but not bad for the area.",

It was busy the day my cousin and I went to eat here, and I feel like a good crowd really determines if the sushi is worth it. (You know, \"the bigger the crowd, the better\" type of mentality). Yama Sushi seems to have a big fan base since I always hear people talk about it a lot, and my friends tell me that it's always busy whenever they go.   I really like that it's down the road from UNLV's campus because you don't really find any good places to get your grub on around there. My cousin and I decided to go with the AYCE lunch special. It's pretty fairly priced (a little lower than average), and you can indulge in some pretty good sushi rolls!  The interior is small compared to some other sushi places, and the seating may be a little packed. We sat right next to another table with just a small divider keeping my elbow from knocking into the person next to me.  Service was okay, and they had different people check up on us throughout our time there. It wasn't warm and friendly, but it was fast and efficient.  I liked most of their rolls, but I think the side orders are what really won me over. The Palm Job was pretty bomb, and the sashimi salad is the best thing if you don't feel like eating sushi rolls. Ask for the creamy sauce when they ask!  Even though Yama Sushi has a cramped interior, the appetizing sushi and sashimi made up for it. I'm so glad my cousin showed me the ways of Yama!",

I was skeptical at the options at first but my brother was content.   I definitely would recommend this place as it wasn't too expensive. Around $24 for the dinner AYCE which is cheap compared to spots in LA and NYC.   If you're in Vegas stop by.",

That's 5 of us .... We met up with 2 friends of ours. That's now a party of 7   The first orders were great! But after that the food was awful and took a long time to come. I ordered a DYNAMITE that smelled like rotten fish soaked in Vinegar... My only regret was not taking a sample to the health department. And yes I notified them ... Unfortunately, we had all eaten a portion.  Needless to say it made us sick later the day.  On the menu it say you will be charged or what you don't eat ... We tried but couldn't do the entire DYNAMITE   But it didn't stop there, there were other things that tasted a little bad or vinegary   So, like I stated after the first order we placed things just went downhill in flavor/taste and presentation....  So we decided to leave and had 2 separate bills .... Can someone explain to me why I had a $19 dollar tip included on my bill and my 2 friends had a $9 tip included on their bill?  That's $28 dollars just for 4 adults and 3 children(who didn't really eat) sitting together. That's 7 people ....We all had the lunch buffet   This place needs to been investigated  NEVER GOING BACK HERE",

Somehow it seemed optimistic to be trying a new restaurant but quickly went downhill. Orders taken but had long pauses in between food being delivered to our table despite the lunch crown pretty much gone. Shrimp tempura was cold and tasted like it was sitting under a warmer as there was hardly any crunch on the tempura. I failed to get the names of their rolls as none impressed any of us. Flavor, if any, was flat or they overpowered what flavor there may have been with some sort of spicy seasoning that was was too hot due to the excess amount on the rolls. Drinks were not refilled regularly and for supposedly a \"highly recommended\" place, it was lackluster. And if you need a fork due to difficulty using chopsticks, know that it will be a plastic fork. With other options available in the city, we will definitely not be in any rush to come back.",

    "text": "Not Fresh, Not Fresh, Not Fresh. Uni and ebi shrimp we ended up spitting out. Tastes of chlorine.  In my opinion, there are two types of sushi eaters.  People who come for a decent Japanese experience and understand that Sushi is the art of eating rice and fish is the condiment.  Then there are people who eat the Americanized rolls which are a ton of rice and sauce.  A lot of people who can't eat raw but come for eel, also fall into this category.  Not saying which is right or wrong but if you came for the latter, just know you're eating bread and potatoes at the buffet.  If you're into the real stuff, the weird stuff, the expensive stuff on the menu that's limited 1 order per customer, then this review is for you.  The uni is sub-par. The ama ebi is a single piece instead of 2 pieces and it comes with a greasy fried shrimp head.   I Eat Japanese to avoid fried food. Not saying that Katsu or Croquets are bad, but thats more for a bento and not a sushi dinner.  The best things on the menu are the Kamas the salmon and the yellowtail.  They are cooked and decent. The raw stuff isn't great.  The salmon is passable but not great.  Also, ask for the rice to be prepared without extra vinegar. They are not asian chefs and have a completely different pallete.  They over sauce the rice and fish and it tastes rancid.  I sent it back and ask them to make it over without vinegar.  Sushi rice should be pre-seasoned with rice vinegar,  it doesn't need more.  They add additional black vinegar and its awful.  I came here because its the cheapest AYCE in the vegas,  now I know why. This place is 24, everywhere else is 27.  I will not cheap out on 3 bux next time.",

We were seated immediately, but were not given menus until we asked for one. The AYCE was our choice & we ordered Goyza, Edamame, seafood salad, & cucumber salad to kick things off. Everything was prepared fresh, & served quickly. The rolls came next; Rainbow, No Name, Dragon, & a few others. All were great. We finished off the meal with some mochi ice cream. Overall, this place is still my favorite, although their success has gone to their heads a little, as they were in a hurry to close up and rushed us out the door at the end of our meal. The speedy service & freshness of the food was what I have come to expect from Yama though, & they have yet to disappoint. *It appears as if Yama is expanding, There was a sign on the door that said they will be closed on June 10, & 11. I saw some guys laying tile in the strip mall store next door, so maybe Yama will be a bit roomier next time we go.",

My friends pigged out on all the rolls but I had some wonderful tempura, ribs, salmon, soup, and yes I even had 2 rolls that were great.   The place is small and has a steady stream of customers. It's off the strip but well worth the taxi ride. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   We could barely walk out of there and should have walked back to the strip we were so full.

The place got packed moments after we were seated though.   The AYCE sushi is fresh (Uni!!! Ikura!!) and delicious! The menu includes various sushi, cut rolls, hand rolls, cooked items, sides, and a couple choices for dessert. They've got all the standard sushi items you would expect at any respectable sushi place, but also have their own special rolls that they've named with a Vegas theme, though most of them seem like other rolls with cream cheese added (not something that floats my boat much...). The service is very friendly, though waiting for some of our orders sometimes took a bit longer than expected.   It takes a bit for me to give 5 stars to a sushi place...its REALLY gotta be amazing in that case. I only drop a half a star because they took a little longer than expected on some of the items, and one item didn't come at all. Not a big deal as we did get our filling, and though we did get our filling, I would have liked to try the other items too.",

Other than those two factors, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Good quality sushi for a great price! If you love AYCE sushi, this is the place for you. $26 for AYCE sushi, including appetizers, entrees, AND desserts! (By the way, the chocolate Mochi is amazing!)  The location is pretty good, about 10 minutes from the strip. Overall, this place has good customer service, good value, great food, and a small, but clean, environment. Definitely the place to go for less expensive AYCE on the East side!",

I travel extensively for work, so I've pretty much hit every major city in the U.S., and while Yama may not be the absolute best, it is the best\"bang for the buck\" sushi I have found. I have always received good service, until today.  I've been a bit lazy about reviewing Yama in a timely fashion, but prior to today I would have given 4.5 stars.  Today knocked the crap out of that 4.5, I would give my experience today a 4 star for the food, but a 2 star for service... I had to ask multiple times for items (two never came). I finally left in disgust! What happened today? It was like an entirely different restaurant, not at all like the Yama I'm used to. Everyone has off days, so I'm cutting them some slack this time. I will try again in a few weeks, hopefully it was an anomaly, but if not I will amend my review, and not be back!",

    "text": "I ate lunch at Yama sushi today and I'm very upset, so depressing, it's like I lost someone close to me, almost like a death in the family, I'm sinking into a depression because of my experience. I've been eating at Yama Sushi for 7 years, nearly every week, I would say 40 time a year, that's nearly 300 times in 7 years. I've brought family and friends from out of town to Yama but after today, I'm done, I lost my favorite sushi restaurant of all time. Today was so amazingly bad, so bad that I can NOT forgive Yama and I can no longer continue to support the business I've grown to love on a weekly basis for the past 7 years. When I walked in today, it took more than 10 minutes just for a waitress to ask if I want water. I quickly ordered my usual and the food took another 10 minutes to come out. When I got my food, I didn't even have a plate, wasabi nor ginger, I had to ask for that and wait another 5 minutes. The first thing to come out was the seafood salad and it was noticeably smaller than it had been in the past, my wife and I normally share the seafood salad and this time it was so small there were only 3 to 4 bites each then done. But wait, the FIRST BITE, my wife got a bone in her salmon, while my wife got a bone in her salmon I was busy being disgusted as to my yellow tail still having the skin on it.  This was not a good way to start out the meal 20 minute in, first dish and we got maybe 8 bites of fish with 1 bone and the skin left on the yellow tail. We ordered 2 eel hand rolls but that was another 20 minutes and I needed to order that twice before even one came out from the chef. Once we got the eel hand roll there was no avocado on the roll, too much rice and we ordered light rice but the worst was, the eel was burnt and inedible. It was as though there was no eel left anywhere in Yama and the sushi chef scrapped the bottom of the oven and put that in the hand roll and called it eel. We later ordered gyoza and those too were inedible, as it turns out the gyoza had freezer burn and then they were deep fried and served. There were parts of the gyoza you just couldn't chew because of freezer burn. Then to top it off, I never did get a refill on my water and my wife's hot water she was topped off with tea instead. We also ordered our favorite Hamachi Kama and we were told they are all out and there is no more. But we later noticed there was a table near the bathroom that had Hamachi  Kama after we were told there wasn't any. We questioned the waitress only to find out, the people with Hamachi Kama were ordering ala cart. When we were getting ready to leave, then we were told we could have the Hamachi Kama if we would like. It appears not all items on the menu are for the AYCE customers any more, only if you order ala cart and pay separately will they give you the more expensive items. This restaurant has been slowly going down hill for the past three months, this is NOT the same Yama Sushi we've all grown to love and consider the best sushi restaurant in the valley, Yama was sold a little over three months ago and is now under new ownership. I've been going to Yama weekly because I work within walking distance and I've seen the slow slip and change from week to week, the quality is getting bad and the new ownership is cutting corners. You should NEVER get a bone in your sashimi, only if your try to save the less expensive cuts of fish.  So back to my opening line, today was a depressing day, I feel as though I lost something very dear to me, for today I lost my favorite sushi restaurant. I spent over $18,000 at Yama Sushi in 7 years, this is truly disappointing, I wish the previous owners a wonderful retirement, you will truly be missed, you had the greatest sushi restaurant of all time, a treasure to the Las Vegas Valley, but today Yama Sushi died and I'm now in mourning.",

The hostess killed it and walked off without a word. Ya, it happened and we saw it.  So, put off to begin with, we were expecting the great food to maybe make us feel OK with our visit after the kerfuffle during seating. The rolls and the cooked dishes were excellent as per usual (and the rolls are delivered much faster than other sushi places). What wasn't on par with what we were expecting was the nigiri and the seafood salad. The fish just didn't taste fresh or chilled in any way. The seafood salad was inedible.  So, while the majority of the time, this AYCE sushi place is great, this last visit just left a bad impression on us and we most likely won't be back.",

Lots of fresh sashimi and I opted for the spicy sauce. It was MMMM Good!  I tried the salmon, tuna, yellow tail, sweet shrimp and scallop sushi. All of it was GREAT except for the Scallop sushi - it was SUPER fishy and not good at all. Def don't recommend THAT. Everything else was great though. Also tried a rainbow roll, spicy tuna and the Happy Ending roll.  There are MANY servers floating around always asking you if you want to order anything else so service is pretty much on point there as well.  As I was reading the reviews a lot of them said the tables were all TOO close together, but apparently they have expanded the restaurant. There are two sushi bars, some awkwardly placed tables as well, but for the most part it was all good!",

    "text": "I love sushi  (but we don't get out as much these days) and when my hubby asked me what I wanted for my special birthday meal, this was my number one choice (we'd never been here but I'd seen this place on yelp and heard good things from many people). Hubby enjoyed it too, because he said he'd like to come here again! Our little one also liked his chicken and rice plate (the server suggested this when we learned that they didn't have fried rice, his favorite).   Lots of choices on the two-sided menu- AYCE includes side dishes and appetizers, but not sashimi (no biggie) and the rules (order small, luckily, you can order half-rolls, which we did; no sharing unless everyone is AYCE) are listed on the front side of the menu. I tried the spicy tuna roll, 007 roll, and ordered several different shrimp rolls, but my favorite one was the Yama Crunch Roll. On the salad side, I loved the Seafood Salad- it was such a good portion of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, and Octopus. I am definitely getting that again! We also had beef teriyaki (excellent), edamame, and gyoza (tasty, but I don't think hubby liked them because they weren't sticky, but a bit on the crunchy side). The Special Rolls are on the back side of the menu. Didn't reach that side, though, because we got full. I didn't want to overdo it. I was satisfied though, and we were also planning to have ice cream later on, too, elsewhere.   Also got a nice presentation for my birthday- two sliced mochi ice cream (mango flavored) with a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle accompanied with a birthday song and a lit candle. Aww, how sweet.  It wasn't crowded, but one of the servers said that dinner is crazy busy. (Good to know!) Lunch is probably better because of that. ($20.95 for lunch AYCE).   Decor is elegant and pretty; and also nicely decorated for the Christmas season. Hubby was surprised at how nice it was inside. It's not big, but it's not hole-in-the-wall, either.   Service was excellent. And really appreciated the suggestions they gave on the sushi rolls. Everyone there is your server. Everyone's very nice, too. Empty plates were quickly taken away.  The website needs a bit of an update. Prices could be listed on there, and the entire menu of sushi, would help out a little, too. Needs some attention. When you click on some items, a message appears on the screen, \"this page is currently under construction.\"    Yes, we plan on coming back here for lunch.",

Sweet shrimp and Uni were really fresh and they included them in the $20.95 lunch which is a treat.  Service was really quick.  Not as many kitchen items as I am used to getting at AYCE sushi bars:  no calamari, fried oysters, or shumai for example.  Portions on the kitchen items are a bit large so don't over order if you are there for the sushi.  One thing I loved about the service is that unlike most sushi bars they actually gave me enough ginger and wasabi for my whole meal.  Yellowtail, tuna, saba, halibut...were all top notch.

But I guess since it is by the college, Mondays would be busy. We ordered 2 rolls, miso soup, chicken teriyaki, and mix tempura.   The miso was good. The rolls came out really fast, they were ok. Tempura was ok. It came with what looked like a tablespoon worth of dipping sauce. By the 3rd or 4th piece it was gone. And the reason why I docked a star, the teriyaki chicken. They give you a thin chicken breast which tasted frozen, slapped on some sauce and price it at $3.99.   The total wasn't too bad under $30, but the food was so mediocre. Oh and not to mention the floor was a slip and slide!!!! I was worried my mom would fall down. I was wearing sneakers and felt like I was ice skating.",

The Chef introduced himself and while i was deciding on my first roll he was busy making me something. He handed me a plate with a roll called NO NAME. Its new to the menu and i suggest you try it. It was delicious. And in between me ordering rolls he was making concoctions for me to try. Im definitely impressed with the level of service and attention i received.   From the server never letting my Lemonade get to the south end of the levy. To even though the Chefs were busy how my rolls kept coming in a timely manner. And i say Go when Jun is working, hes a master at the rolls in my eyes. And from the Appetizer i had Chicken Teriyaki i was so engulfed which trying new rolls i forgot i ordered it til it came out which was quickly as well. The other patrons are more than friendly as well when they are your bar neighbor. I had so many rolls but the No Name and The Harry Potter and the Wet Dream stood out to me. Sad that i went to UNLV for 4 years and drove by Yama everyday and never went in. Im kicking myself because it was YAMA YUMMY.  They didnt go overboard on rice or sauce. My Wasabi and Ginger didnt come out right away but thats not enough to deter me. And try the Mochi Ice cream. I shall be back maybe soon as the next day lol.",

Save your stomach for dessert especially the mochi.  It's just so good here and the price is amazing for what you can get!  There are so many choices here that it boggles the mind.  I love choices!  The sushi here is great and you get more than what you pay for.  I didn't have any fishy taste when I ate it.  Definitely fresh and so delicious.  The parking is ample and it is very close cramped seating.  Expect a wait during dinner time. The service was amazing!  It's one of my favorite sushi places in Vegas and I can't wait to return back!",

But it was good to try something a bit different. It's regular stuff is fresh and they even have white(or fatty) tuna. They do a la carts and also have an all you can eat prices. So good it's tuna that melts in your mouth. I think I ate here every day while I stayed at the Bellagio. It's always packed if it's your first time there so you might want to reserve the room in the back if you have a large party with you. I like sitting at the sushi bar so I'm always able to find a seat. Totally recommend!",

There's a reason for all the people waiting! It's excellent sushi, all-you-can-eat for a great price. The only thing you can possibly be charged extra for is wasted sushi and drinks. The service is pretty quick considering how packed it usually is, and they opened up a new section recently so more people can enjoy all that Yama has to offer. I spent a year away in Europe and this was the first place I wanted to eat when I went back to Las Vegas. Don't waste your money on the Strip, Yama is a quick cab ride away and TOTALLY WORTH IT!",

I was with my parents and we ordered mostly raw sushi but as far as Separate orders from all of us I ordered 3 plates of yellowtail, my dad ordered tuna roll and a unagi roll (sorry for my spelling typo) for my mom. I wish we could've ordered more, but we didn't want to spend over our limit, yet I was only one who could eat more sushi. Great Restaurant, But there's another reason why also other than it being expensive It seems like the wait staff don't know who is taking orders for certain table. I mean I can agree yeah I'm happy Grab our attention By being prompt and attentive, But have more communication on who took The Order.",

    "text": "I've been hearing a lot of people liking to go to a nearby-campus sushi place called Yama Sushi. From what i've heard a lot of my friends like going there. After over a year, i finally got to try it for myself a few days ago. Went with one who likes going there, one who came from So cal, and another friend who i usually go with and try new places, and rate/review them.   First impression? Its another sushi place run by entirely koreans. At least i wasnt greeted with a Hi or in korean, and was at least in japanese... Lol Went about prime time for dinner, around 7pm on a friday night. pretty packed. lucky enough got a few seats at the sushi bar. $20/person for lunch, $24/person for dinner. average AYCE sushi prices.   First impression of the bar? every piece of fish is pre-sliced to be used. 1st test? fail. 2nd test? do they cover the fish? initially yes. once begin to use? no. result? fail. since my friend likes yama sushi so much, we decided to try it anyway.  Luckily... (maybe unfortunately...?) we had the current manager as our server. which is kind of weird. hope hes not the owner. starting off, we ordered friend soft shell crabs, hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar), and a seafood salad. 1 of the 2 ordered soft shell crabs came quite quickly. 2nd one? no where to be found for at least 10 minutes. hamachi kama? sold out (later saw one walk right past me... gave them benefit of the doubt and said that was the last one they had... unlucky me..) when the chef handed us the seafood salad, it wasnt 1 order.. it was 2... 1 normal.. 1 spicy. quite weird actually.... we only ordered 1 to share.. so i didnt know what a seafood salad was, thinking it was like a shrimp and crab salad tossed in like mayo or something.. it wasnt.. it was cubed sashimi... normal one was topped with a white sauce over a bed of shredded daikon.. nice. spicy one was that but it sat in a pool of spicy sauce... looks? not too good. taste? not bad. since the spicy covered almost any sort of taste on the fish, i tried it on the normal one. tuna was a bit dry. salmon was ok, minimal fat. yellow tail was... eh.   so me and my friend who i go with testing places, ordered 2 salmon nigiri, 2 tuna nigiri, 2 yellowtail nigiri, and 2 tamago nigiri. as i said before, their preparation the fish was mediocre at best. having the fish uncovered will dry it out over time. having it pre-cut already increases the surface area of the fish which further dries it out and loses its quality and freshness. amount of rice is quite a lot per nigiri. rice doesnt seem to be made by the chefs either. i just see containers of rice brought out from the back while none of the chefs up in front have disappeared.. no good... the rice for sushi is a sushi chef's pride.   so nigiri test? didnt do so well for us... we actually was kind of scared for our stomachs later due to how they keep their fish...   my other 2 friends ordered rolls.. those were pretty good. decent sized. flavorful. unique. size was pretty decent.   one good thing was all u can eat dessert. ice cream and mochi... honestly, other than this and maybe... the rolls, i cant give much any other positive points for this place... service was decent.. the waitresses filled my friend's soda quite fast... i never noticed him finishing his drink until the waitress asks to refill it. lol  one thing that id like to mention. the so called manager (we saw his picture on the wall with the label manager under it) continuously asking us if we wanted to try something... a lot of times he makes something and like puts it in front of us.. and be like \"hey try this. its really good. \" We are like... uhm... we want to order our own things... he did this at least a few times.. quite annoying.... we think it was an order he may have messed up and tried to give it to us so it doesnt get wasted... kind of bad imo..   ----------------------------------------------  Overall, rating for this place, aside from the star rating by yelp that u are required to give, my friend and i rate this place a 2-3 of 10.",

I found a seat at the bar and starting chowing down.  Now normally I can put away quite a bit, but today was amazing. Usually I start with just the nigiri to check the quality and so that I can really taste the fish. Then from there I'll move onto the rolls. But not here. The quality and freshness was so good that I stuck with the nigiri from my entire AYCE.  In the end I walked away after 50 pieces of nigiri. No rolls. Hamachi, Maguro, Salmon, etc, all of it was good. Quality fish and quality rice. The service was efficient, too. I wouldn't say it was the friendliest, but what did I care? I was on a mission.  After that trip, I now look forward to going here for every trip to Vegas. Well worth it!",

But what I like the most is the fact that they have All You Can Eat reasonably priced, $25 or less, depending on lunch or dinner.  When one roll costs $9-$12, I'm going to get All You Can Eat.  Especially since that comes with all the appetizers, rolls, and desert you want.  As I am typing this, I can see Cheree L.'s review about getting sick.  I'm sorry to hear this has happened to her, but it's never happened to me.  I've had nothing but great food and great service at Yama.",

Two people cannot walk side by side to their table, and its literally a one way road, where you have to make sure no one is coming towards you. The exit was difficult to get to because they had a gentleman sitting right at the corner of the bar, making it so that we had to side step out of there. My husband and I were literally rubbing elbows with a group next to us, which I wouldn't mind, if we weren't sitting next to some loud talking dingus. Again, sushi yummy,  crowd...not so much. :/",

I don't care much for the names, but some of my favorite ones include \"Kiss the A**\" ,\"Double Dragon\" and the baked salmon rolls (these take a while to make but well worth the wait). Be prepared for long waits, especially at peak hours of lunch and dinner. Service could be a little faster at times which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. But hey, they are usually quite busy, so at times I can understand, but there was one occasion where they forgot to get my family one of the sushi dishes we ordered. Overall, a great place, and great AYCE sushi. Their side dishes, like the seafood salad, is something to try if you're also into raw seafood salads. Please check this place out if you're in Vegas or are in town visiting. It's a few miles east of the strip on the corner of Maryland Pkwy and Flamingo Rd, next to Albertsons supermarket.",

    "text": "Yama Sushi is my favorite sushi joint until I can find better. Most of the specials are tasty and the nigiri is good. My faves are man whore, sun of the beach, and something else with crunchy eel. Their seafood salad is excellent I could just drink up the sauce haha. Gyoza is good, yakitori is good, mussels are okay. I thought both the soft shelled crab and deep fried mussels were tasteless. I think the worst item they serve is the BBQ Beef. It is thin beef shortrib that is super chewy and rubbery and tastes like salty garlic. I hope they improve on it - at least grill it.  I appreciate the excellent customer service no matter how busy it gets. An even better fact is that you can have as much ice cream and mochi ice cream as you want.",

    "text": "We went into this restaurant our first night in Las Vegas, after driving from Oceanside, CA, and checking into our hotel. I had done my research on the place before the Vegas trip with my wife and kid, and decided to give it a shot. We arrived there at around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was no wait for us to be seated- awesome! We got seated, and found out that since my kid is 2 years old, she gets to eat the all-you-can-eat for free! So, my wife and I both got AYCE, and ordered for the three of us. The sushi tasted fresh, and was brought out in a timely manner, which was surprising since the place was packed. There were some rolls that you can only have once, like the no-name roll, and the Ellen roll and, boy, were they good! We ended with some ice cream, and it was delicious as well.  A few things to note:  - Our bill came up to $60 after tax and tip for 2 people. Not bad for the quality of sushi that you got.  - You can order anything from the menu, and some things you can only order one per person (Ellen and no-name rolls). We could have gotten three each of those (since there were three of us), but decided not to. I'm not sure if the restaurant employees are strict on that policy, but we didn't try to test it.  - The restaurant has a no wasting rule. If you, for example, decide to eat the fish only in your sushi rolls, and don't want to eat the rice, then you get charged... Again, I'm not sure if the restaurant enforces this, but it's stated on the menu.  - We only got one menu for our table. It was kind of difficult for us to try to stare at one menu with our 2-year old being interested in using the menu as a toy as well. I guess it's the norm here, because all the other tables we looked at had one menu.  - They gave us our check before we were done eating. My wife wanted more ice cream, and we asked for it as we were handing over my credit card. Needless to say, it was a bad decision to pay and then ask for more food. We never got our ice cream, after waiting a while, writing in the tip and signing, and just deciding to leave.  This place still gets a 5-star review despite the shortcoming on the ice cream. Perhaps they were doing us a favor, because we left there stuffed! We'll probably be back the next time we visit Las Vegas. It was thoroughly enjoyable.",

    "text": "After finally hearing all the great things my friend Gina raves about at Yama, I decided to join her and a few other friends for a late night dinner date at Yama sushi. I'm so mad that it took me so long to finally come here. Although there was a 30 minute wait at 10 pm on a Friday night and we still had to sit at the sushi bar, it was worth the wait!!!  I have to say I was overwhelmed a bit with all the hustle and bustle of the place because it is such a small restaurant that it took me a while to calm down and soak in the chaos and choose what I wanted to eat. First off I usually don't order AYCE because most places are so expensive and I usually don't eat more than 2 rolls but here the price is such a steal at ~ $22 that I couldn't pass it up. I think between the 5 of us we must have ordered everything off the menu and literally everything was ammmaazzziinnggg!!!  Here is my top choices.  -Palm job.....I ordered 2 because they were sooo good. The second one I added asparagus to.  -Green mussels....awesome!!! I'm not sure what sauce it is topped with but it was melt in your mouth to die for.  -Seafood salad and seaweed salad delicious  -Wet Dream, Son on the Beach roll (i think that's the name)....Honestly they ordered so many rolls that I ended up just trying everyone elses that I didn't even order my own, but everything I tried was awesome and like I said I think we ended up trying all the rolls. LOL  Everything is soo fresh and the sushi chefs graciously make sample plates of their favorite sushi creations for you to try throughout your dining experience A+++++ :D  To end the night I tried chocolate and vanilla mochi ( i really wanted the mango but they were out) and the red bean and plum ice cream. The plum was super yummy and so was the mochi!!  On a side note my 4 friends all did a quail egg shot (not for me thanks) but since it was all their first time they each had a different reaction but were pleasantly surprised that they were not grossed out instead they said it tasted good.  -I can't wait to go back!!!!!!",

The food was always very fresh, but the prices were elevated, considering that the food selection was anything but special.   The food selection was just run of the mill sushi place. Nothing too tradtional or too novel, yet it was good. I probably won't come here very often unless I am in UNLV area. There is nothing \"special\" about this sushi place, but it is better and fresher than many in the Vegas area.  Service is poor and prices are high, especially for being located almost right on a college campus. Servers and owners could use an attitude adjustment and lower their prices and then I would be a slightly more loyal customer.",

Everywhere was booked because of CES, but at Yama they don't take reservations which was perfect for us because we would have a shot at getting a table.  The place was packed when we arrived.  We all got the all you can eat option which included dessert.  There was one rule and that is you pay for any left overs which I thought was very clever.  We ordered several rolls and specials.  Our favorites were the Harry Potter roll, seafood salad which was excellent and the rainbow roll.  If you like sushi and you're in for a fun night, Yama sushi is the place to go.  I would not go there with kids, given the names of the rolls on the menu.  4 stars for food and service and 5 stars for laughs and entertainment from the item names on the menu.",

    "text": "This is was our favorite sushi place to go to, however we've switched to Bluefin on Sunset and Annie Oakley. Whenever we were served by Jun we had a good meal with expedient roll delivery. My favorite things to order; spicy seafood salad with extra radish, sun of the beach, no name roll, uni, and the seaweed salad. Mmm, I left with a happy belly every time. If you become overzealous upon seeing the menu and order a ton of rolls, expect the waitress to drop by and ask if you want to cancel anything about a half hour or so in. All of the special rolls we've tried have been tasty, and there's a high turn over so the fish has been fresh. The amaebi was a little disappointing, and the portion sizes/quality have varied slightly with the different chefs but given how busy the restaurant is (it's often packed with a long wait for larger parties) it's understandable. Overall it's been very tasty, well worth the money! They even have mirugai, which is rare. We were going about once a week for several months. EDIT: Went for our weekly trip with some of the boyfriend's family. We were lucky and got to sit at the bar with Jun and he hooked us up with several pieces of hamachi belly sashimi, which was ridiculously good! By the time we left the line was out the door. I love this place :} EDIT #2: The fish is even fresher at Bluefin at Sunset & Annie Oakley!        Yama has been outdone!!",

My Dad is a sushi connoisseur and has eaten sushi everywhere from west coast to east coast and has sworn by this place to me for years as his ALL TIME FAVORITE SUSHI place. And if you know him you know this is a big deal. Well my friend and I went off his reviews. The food is excellent, very fresh and they have an all you can eat sushi lunch and din special. We were there for lunch so it was $20 a person. We sat at the bar and could easily tell the chef our orders. We got a ton of nigiri rolls (order the garlic tuna..I ate 8 by myself), the yama crunch, Tiger roll (my favorite) and spicy tuna and a few more that I can't recall. You can also add in any appetizers included in the price which we got the soft shell crab and some salads. To top it off you can then end your meal with dessert and like I said theres no limits so we each got 2. A mango mochi and a green tea. The rice in the nigiri isn't an overwhelming amount and the sushi rolls also come in half rolls so that you can try more. By the time we ordered we had our rolls in what seemed like less than 60 seconds. I am just all around blown away. This place rocks. After they called us a cab back to the strip for more vegas exploring. It is worth the trip to make it out here.",

On a return visit this past Vegas trip, I noticed the quality had gone down and the popularity had gone up.  The fish is still very, very fresh.  The only complaint I had from the place was the rice.  The sushi rice was not seasoned at all.  Not only that, it was very sticky like it was right out of the rice cooker.  Sushi rice needs to be seasoned and left out for a little bit otherwise you just have a rice ball.    I don't know what's better, the sauce on the \"kiss the ass\" roll, or our fobby waitress saying, \"kiss the ass\" as she puts it on the table.  We ordered a few rolls and a lot of the nigiri.  The rolls were good and they let you make half orders.  This is great if you want to try a variety of them.  They had sweet shrimp and they even fried the heads.  I love that.  It also seemed the nigiri was very inconsistent.  Some of them had a big piece of fish on top and some had lots of rice.  I didn't really mind they limit you one of some of the items, because how much uni and giant clam can you really eat?  The appetizers were just okay.  The yakitori and the agadashi tofu weren't all that great.  We ordered a few others, but they weren't memorable enough for me to even recall what they were.    The dessert was nice.  Most places don't usually include that.  Mochi ice cream can't be bad.",

Note to others, this place is cramped and loud, but it's loads of fun! We went on a Wed. night and only had to wait 20 minutes or less for 2 seats at the bar. We were served by a host of waitresses and our sushi was prepared by the manager Jun. He was soo amazing and even gave us a free seafood salad, which I might add is the best thing in the joint if you are looking for a plethora of sashimi! The dinner ran us about $23 per person for the AYCE and it didn't include drinks. I had a 7-up and my boyfriend had an Asahi beer so by the end of the night we had eaten about $100 or more worth of sushi and had only spent about $45-50. A tip for this place is that you tip your sushi master if you sit at the bar, a good tip for the amount we ate was $10. Mind you we didn't leave the Yama waddling with our bellys to the max, we made sure to pace ourselves.   If you do the AYCE, you mush finish everything on your plate or they charge by the pieces you order, but you can place each dish order 1 at a time, so if you know your limits, you'll be fine",

Moving to Vegas from California I was afraid all quality sushy would be removed from my life.  However, I will repeat that I have never been disappointed here!  I almost always get the all you can eat for $23 (dinner price...fat ass, I know) because I can never decide on just one roll, or a small number of a la carte sushi.

The sushi is so delicious and all the flavors mesh so well together, I was left craving more even though I ate more sushi than I should in one sitting.  I've gone before with my cousin and am not sure what I ordered but her and her husband ordered from their buffet and suggested that I did too.  I decided against it and just ordered one roll.  I went again with my bf and we really craved sushi and were really hungry so we decided to try the buffet, best decision of our lives!  We ordered one minute man, no name, harry potter, baby one more time, sun of the beach, double dragon and one night at yama.  My bf fell in love with one minute man and I really enjoyed no name, I want to go to Vegas just for this sushi place! I'm not even sure how much the buffet is but the total for me and my bf was about 50 bucks, it was well worth it. We stuffed our faces with great sushi! Oh and the place can get kinda cramped so groups probably have to wait for a table.",

Once again ill break it down simple  SERVICE was attentive not obnoxious attentive but good attentive. FOOD was decent sushi but there is one thing that is special here and no where else...read on Yelpers...  I usually order the all you can eat dinner for 23.00 and I get Giant Clam - A bit below standard Sweet Shrimp - Standard Uni - Standard Salmon Skin Roll - Standard but they put the SWEET EEL sauce on it so you have been warned. Yellowtail - Standard Halibut w/Ponzu sauce - Standard Miso Soup - Tasted pretty good but like the person before me mentioned-lukewarm? Wassup wit that?!?!? Salad (x2) - Dressing is pretty tasty and the main reason I go here.......................... DYNAMITE Im a big fan of the ol' JAPANESE SEAFOOD PIE but there is a twist here... The owners are KOREAN (Im not big on the whole JAP vs KOR sushi thing, if you make good sushi I dont care if you are AFRICAN, Good is Good no matter the nation) The reason I note this is beacause the DYNAMITE is flavored much differently than any other DYNAMITE I have ever tasted. NOW I wont go out and say its the BEST EVA....but its pretty darn good. The best I can describe it as - Peppery with Mayo cream FUNK and the SIRICHA just to FREAK IT!!!  Made with giant clam, scallops, chopped onions and diced mushrooms this dish is UNIQUE TASTING!!!  Pretty much everything is standard Sushi, but what really keeps me coming back is the DYNAMITE. If you like DYNAMITE give this place a try and you might like it. Overall a pretty decent choice.  Eat Drink and be FUNKY!!!",

I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I decided to take my husband, brother, and sis in law because it was rated so high on yelp... This place was amazing! FRESH FRESH FRESH! Spicy Tuna, Unagi, and of course UNI...!!! Even people that don't like raw sushi would love this joint because my husband loved it also... Of course he stayed away from the raw sushi but he was all over the crunch shrimp roll, unagi, and pretty much anything with avocado, shrimp, eel, and of course he loved the fire cracker... WARNING!!!  however it's a AYCE place  u def need to finish everything or else they will charge you... they definitely point that out more than once... only negative thing about the place was the fact that I had 1 spoon full of rice I pulled to the side and waitress told me they will charge me for it so my husband ate it for me... that's a real man! :-)",

    "text": "First, before I make my comments about this place I want to say that I am a very easy to please food addict. You will see that I give most places 4 stars.   So here goes my review:  we went with a whole group of newly minted friends, 14 people. The place was packed and luckily someone from the group had booked a party room so we did not have to wait. There were not enough chairs for us so I corralled two extra chairs.  This is the first time I have been to a sushi place this popular: a line of hungry patrons waiting to be seated at 745PM. Normally by 745PM most restaurants are pretty sparse.  We all had the special: all you can eat. During the whole dinner the waitress kept reminding us that there was too many orders and that we would have to pay for left overs. Kind of disturbing feeling that they did not to want to make more than we can eat...okay I understand the financial reasons. So we asked to review our orders half way through and adjusted accordingly (some ordered more and some deleted the orders).  I have written about my experiences at Sushi Avenue in Las Vegas. To compare the Yama Sushi to Sushi Avenue will be like night and day. Sushi Avenue outshines Yama Sushi by a light year. There is one reason why the food was so inferior at Yama Sushi: All the sushi was topped with teriyaki sauce. Really!!   Every dish we ordered had the stylish zig zag pattern from the squeeze bottle. So all the different sushi ordered tasted the same = teriyaki! At Sushi Avenue the sauce for each dish was original and unique. Sushi Avenue sushi was unusual but very delicious, out of this world experience. Yama's sushi was the traditional fare that can be found at other sushi restaurants, which is not bad. Except Yama dresses up their sushi with teriyaki sauce. Why? Not sure but am thinking it is because so many people like the sweat flavor of teriyaki chicken?   For my soft shell crab roll I scraped off the teriyaki sauce and it tasted so delicious and crunchy. Unfortunately, the sauce had saturated the nori so there was a bit of teriyaki sauce flavor. Still I could live with it. After my soft shell crab roll, I started scraping off as much as I could from each plate. I ordered 6 different plates for myself and every dish had teriyaki sauce dripped on them.   Our wives complained about the food all night long. I listened to half the table complaining and half saying how yummy it was.   The high point of the evening was the green tea ice cream for dessert. That was good. But then green ice tea is green ice team, I hope.   Would I go back to the place?  Definitely not.  Would I recommend Yama Sushi?  No.   Folks, drive an extra 15 minutes and go to Sushi Avenue. Have the screaming ectasy or just tell the waitress: chef special. Any dish will be 100% better than Yama's.  By the way, I have no relation nor work with or for Sushi Avenue. I don't even know the owners. Just fond of all kinds of good food. When my Dad and I talk on the phone it is always about food. 1 hour call is 50 minutes of what restaurants or food we had since we last talked.",

We always get the all-you-can-eat which covers most of their rolls anyways and they even have special ones you can order that aren't on the AYCE menu.  I always order the spicy sashimi salad.  Even just one or two orders of these, you'll get your money's worth for the all-you-can-eat price.  I love the quail egg so I was happy to find out that they served that here too.",

    "text": "Normally I would give this place a pretty good rating. However, today change my perspective towards this place.  I came here with a friend of mine during lunch, we were one of the few to arrive early (right when it was just opened).  We ordered 2 Uni sushi (total of 4 pieces), the waitress (named Haeyun) came back and told us that Uni has not been deliver yet. So I asked if we could substitute it for another item equivalent with the \"*\" item of the Uni.  The waitress said NO, she also mentioned that she asked the manager as well. But I had a feeling that she didn't. This incident made DISLIKE this place. I understands if I came here at night and the item I wanted was sold out, then I wouldn't complained. But under the circumstance that we were here when it was just opened and this was not our fault that they didn't order their sushi on time, we believe that they just lost some valuable customers (along with all my friends who come here quite often).",

    "text": "Good and cheap eats...my go to place for AYCE Sushi when I am in Sin City.  Food: 5/5 Been here a couple of times, and their food quality is pretty consistent.  Interesting names for their sushi items (censorship needed for those not-of-age, yet), with a generous selection of rolls, sashimi, and non-fish dishes.  Really love their sweet shrimp (never comes out fishy smelling), salmon nigiri, uni nigiri, soft shell crab roll...the list can go on. I think I am going through withdrawal now that I am thinking about their food.  You also get complimentary mochi ice cream , and that could be a challenge, because you'd probably be in sushi coma/heaven by that time.  But who can resist mochi ice cream ?  Service: 4/5 Friendly and efficient.  Plates get cleared when they are empty, and the next round of dishes come out within minutes of placing your order.  It can get busy, so the service might be slow, but once you get the server's attention, things get done or filled quickly.  Ambiance: 3/5 A bit outdated, but who cares, as long as the food and service are both top notch.  A bit small for the type a crowd that they can generate during busy hours. The seats are a bit uncomfortable, perhaps not enough cushion for my tushy? The floors are sticky, but the restrooms are clean.  They have a sushi bar manned with 3-4 sushi chefs at a time. Behind the sushi bar, there's this panel of mosaic photos that appear to be of an island backdrop?  This is located in a strip mall, and you can easily pass by it if you don't pay attention to their sign.  It is truly a hidden gem.  Final Verdict: Yes, a frequent visitor when I am in town!",

Both time we went with a group of friends and did AYCE, and most items we got were fresh and tasty, especially the white tuna which is so good (although we heard it was bad for you...). Most of the rolls on the menu we tried were tasty, as were the sushi pieces which are generous size for the cuts of fish. One drawback is that it's always crowded, especially on a weekend night, so expect to wait for a long time unless you go during off hours. Considering how much buffets are these days in the nicer hotels, this place is cheap if you are only interested in good sushi and not in other fluff. We will definitely go again next time we are in Vegas.",

If I slipped one more sushi in me, they would have to carry me out on a stretcher.  The selection and quality here is just superb.  I'm not going to hit every single thing we got, but some things that made this place worth your time and money were how efficient the ordering was and freshness of the food.  My recommendation is to pace yourself and not over indulge.    Get the spicy seafood mix! outstanding! its got a nice balance of flavors and various raw fish! you will get your bang for the buck right hurrrr!

At any other place, I would probably get some weird look or a slap in the face; however, at Yama Sushi, I just get a big smile. So one of my friends recommended this AYCE sushi place to me in Vegas. At first I was extremely skeptical, considering the closest ocean to Vegas is about 6 or 7 hours away. However, when I came in and saw the huge menu, I was completely caught off guard at the quality and the selection. Addtionally, I love the back side to the menu where they have Yama's rolls which all have the most interesting names.  Normal sushi:  Tuna/ yellowtail/ albacore sashimi- awesome Octopus/ squid sashimi- Not so much, too chewy for my taste  Sea urchin- Tastes very fishy, not my taste, but some of our group loved it.   Yama's specialty rolls:   Harry potter- It's like a garlic tempura roll- pretty awesome  Happy ending- It's a tuna roll with lemon- Really tangy  Man whore- It's like a Philly cheese roll- No one should ever mix cream cheese with sushi.  Hot night- Very spicy- But pretty good as well Who's your daddy- It's okay.   Dessert:  Green tea ice cream- awesome  Mango mochi- awesome  Red bean ice cream- tastes like candy   All of this only cost me $27 with tip. FREAKING AMAZING, TALK ABOUT HAVING A HAPPY ENDING. Even though we had to wait for an hour it was worth it! My only gripe is the sushi isn't the most fresh and most of the rolls are hit or miss, but the selection makes up for it. Best AYCE sushi in Vegas hands down.   Unfortunately, since it's an AYCE I can't ask for a happy ending to go ;D.",

However, our party of four totally defeated their so-called \"trick.\"  We were already hungry coming from the airport and ordered appetizers, rolls and literally the entire menu.  Their seafood dynamite is nothing to praise about.  A bunch of shelled clams and some scallops in their version of dynamite sauce tossed in the oven for a couple minutes.  On the flip side, their rolls are really good.  Can't go wrong with any of them actually.  I just wish they served nigiri and sashimi as part of their \"All You Can Eat\" buffet.  Other than the service, I would definitely recommend this place.  Not exactly located in the best part of town but if you get there early enough, you can miss the circus running around outside.",

    "text": "If you are looking for AYCE go to Yama.. lunch is $22 and dinner is $25, I  HIGHLY recommend the seafood salad as a starter! This place is a little hole in the wall on flamingo but it is worth the drive!  The place gets busy and they do not take reservations so if you have a big party make sure most of your group shows up together or they wont seat you. They recently expanded so there is more seating and they have two sushi bars instead of one. They are usually pretty quick with making your orders, like I said they get really busy it might take a little longer during dinner and weekends. Plan accordingly. Worst part is the wait, ive waited upwards of 30 minutes, but the sushi is worth it!",

    "text": "I'm a frequent AYCE'r at Sumo Sushi II, but I had a friend in town from Reno who wanted some sushi. Since he was staying on the strip I didn't feel like taking him to the SW part of town so I yelped for something closer to the strip.  We got there around 7pm on a Monday and it was packed which is always a good sign. Since we didn't mind sitting at the bar, we got seated right away. I prefer this because you can always have the attention of the sushi chef and get served right away.  The food was delicious and there was plenty of options. I ate all the yellowtail until my belly was content. The staff was very attentive taking the dirty dishes away.  However, my -2 star review has to do with the sushi chef we had. He was the only Hispanic chef there and at the beginning he was very nice and accommodating. Towards the end he completely changed, he must have got irritated with us because my friend and I H-A-T-E spicy food. We ordered the seafood salad and the options on the menu were (none, mild, spicy) we told him we didn't want it spicy, so do what you do. He rolled his eyes at us like it was an unusual request. Then he gave me a sample fish (I had no idea what he was doing) and then put sauce in a bowl and handed it over. However, he didn't let go....we were trying to pull the bowl down and he didn't let go... It was like a struggle!!! So I ended up bringing up my fish to the bowl and took a sample of the sauce. Did he think we were going to run off with his sample sauce??? After that shit, it was just awkward. My friend was like, \"wtf???\" Pretty sure I'm not going to wrestle with the sushi chef for a sauce sample. There was also a language barrier, I had no idea what he was saying.  I would go visit again, but I would definitely avoid the Hispanic sushi chef.",

They have several additions to the menu in the chichi me that allows more in flavorful infusion different types of spicy spices. Staff is very helpful in finding the perfect dish for your pallet. Tonight I had the jalapeno sashimi, it was very fresh and delicious. It did have some heat to it but well worth it. I can not express the freshness to the fish. Over all a wonderful dinning experience. Ps try the cucumber salad and the deep fried banana thing. Wow",

    "text": "This is always a place we stop while in Vegas. It is usually not disappointing but this trip just did it for us. Once they expanded, their service went down. Food takes forever to come, roughly about 20 minutes in between orders. Orders are always forgotten and missing. It took about 30 minutes to get edamame, even though tables next to us got it right away. When you tell them you want something, they sometimes write it down, so if they don't, your order is forgotten. The food quality is always average, except for the sashimi salad. Seafood salad is always a must! It never disappoints. Each person can only order one, but it's enough for one person. As for sushi, I feel like every time I go, there's always more and more rice to make you full faster. The rice also doesn't taste too good, very dry and sticky and no taste. The mochi ice cream is a must as well!!! They used to give 2 per person but now only one :( I guess it was getting too expensive? Anyways, we still come here when we just crave sushi. The price is fair for lunch and dinner for the quality of food. They just need to improve their service and quickness of food delivered to your table.",

We were a group of 10, so our wait was about 30-40min (understandable). When we were called to be seated, they guided us to this little cute isolated closed in room! It was perfect. The service wad a solid attempt for excellence, but sadly they forgot 2 of our orders twice.. Regardless, they were super kind.   As for the food.. I loved the menu and what they offered. Loved how they had the huge seafood poke salad included with their AYCE, plus the crispy soft shell crabs, etc (great appetizer choices), BUT as for the tastes of it all, it wasn't as amazing as they looked. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but all missing something. This also goes for the sushi rolls. I felt like the quality of all the food just wasn't there, compared to other sushi places I've gone to...  Knock out of Star #1: mediocre food Knock out of Star #2: forgot some orders multiple times (I waited like 30minutes after everyone else got their sushi rolls until I got mine)   Overall food was okay and service was okay too. Great attempt, but just not all the way there for me..",

    "text": "When we first moved to Vegas, we came here on a 118 degree day while the in-laws were in town and discovered what all-you-can-eat sushi was. We were foolish because we stuffed ourselves beyond capacity on a boiling hot day, after my mother-in-law was experiencing being drunk for the first time. We had SO MANY leftovers, and were charged $18 overage, fair enough.   Since that fateful June day in 2013, we've eaten A LOT of AYCE sushi - nearly every week...but this was only the third time we've been to Yama. It's probably our last visit.   You can count on Yama being jam-packed with people at any given moment, so much so that they've nearly doubled their size since our first visit ...and it doesn't feel any roomier. They jam a table wherever there is an 'available' two foot square space. Mood lighting is how I would describe the brightness inside - which isn't always good, as you'll see a few people using the flashlight on their smartphone to read the menu. Yikes.   When we arrived on Friday, our friends were already there waiting on us, and as we approached the table, one of the three waitresses serving us that night (a bit overkill) asked me if I knew what I wanted. ...I politely told her, \"Yes, to sit down and look at the menu.\" I was totally thrown off. So much so that I never ordered my usual order at all, and ended up with things that she just awkwardly suggested to me that were the opposite of my taste preferences. Crazy.   When it comes to my palate, I can't do spicy things - my theory is that I overdid it as a youngin' and broke my mouth. This being said, I didn't try the spicy tuna roll, but the three guys at the table who normally shovel them down their gullet returned the one they ordered because 'it didn't taste right'...and that was good enough for me.   The nigiri was a good size, and you can get any roll as a half roll with the exception of those which only have 5 or 6 pieces, because size-wise it's already a half roll. The seaweed salad was on point - (odd to mention the seaweed salad, I know - but it was good!). Sometimes there's too much dressing(?) on it, making it slimy - but it was just right. Also, whatever the chef's special was that they brought over to us was delicious.   The sushi is just okay here. it's not phenomenal nor memorable, but if you're okay with being jammed in, pressured to order, and squinting at your dinner-mates while sipping on nasty tap water and celebrating at least 8 birthdays in 60 minutes - then this is the place for you. At least it's a bit cheaper, at only $23 per person.   Oh! something great was that they have fantastic plum ice cream, and they let everyone at the table have a mochi, even if they've already ordered a dessert. ...it's the small things.",

    "text": "ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI?!  As a sushi lover, I was delighted to hear that during my most recent trip to Las Vegas, we were going to try this place. We went during the lunch hour and did not have to wait for a table for 5 adults and 2 three year-old kids.  We looked at the menu and strategically decided which rolls to order and share between all of us. All of us were AYCE (all you can eat), even the kids, which is a pretty good deal since the lunch AYCE price is about $20 and if you purchase two rolls, that would probably come to the same price. The kids were half of that price, if anyone was wondering.  Anyway, we order the first round of sushi and it came out within 10 minutes of us ordering. I ordered the double-salmon roll and the baked man-whore roll. I thought out of all the sushi rolls we had ordered, the man-whore roll was the best.  Unfortunately, if you want to order soup (other than miso) they don't have any. Their portions for things that are under appetizers like chicken and beef are pretty small, but everything on the menu is AYCE, so if you want more that's always an option.  There are limits to how many times you can order certain things on the menu, and you get charged if you have leftovers at the table, so be sure to only order what you can eat. At lunch you have a one and a half hour time limit, and for dinner I believe it is two hours.  The sushi was fresh and delicious. I recommend coming earlier in the day rather than later to beat all of the late risers looking for lunch in the area. We left the restaurant around one and there were quite a few people waiting outside for a table. In my opinion it is worth the wait! You can check out all the cool photos as well so you can see what each roll looks like and other things on the menu as well while waiting!",

Sun if the beach,  Dragon,  wet dream roll very fantastic.. We enjoyed the meal very much.  Can't find this sushi at the strip.   We had to wait almost an hour to get a table for 3 The only downside was we had to wait atleast an hour on our way back ( was also restaurants closing time)  to wait for taxi.  None of the taxis coming were willing to take our 3 year old.  The hostess in the restaurant was genuinely concerned and kept calling the taxi company to make sure we get our proper cab.  Quite impressive service I must say!",

Yama is my third favorite sushi place and I'd come more often if they offered brown rice and if I didn't have to wait over 40 minutes to get seated.   This joint is definitely a neighborhood sushi joint, which could explain why they are always packed on friday and saturday nights, but that's a good thing.  Overall this place is still great and my favorite hot dish is the Tonkatsu chicken and their california rolls, which are a little on the small side, but still good.",

I have to give a big thumbs up to this place. coming from san jose, we dont have many all you can eat sushi places, especially because it would never last in our city. we have a couple but the fish is totally not that fresh in my opinion. this place gets packed though! so there might be a wait. i initially noticed that this was a korean ran sushi place, since a 2/3s of the staff was korean.   we were seated, we started marking off the paper. they had salads, appetizers, nigiri, rolls, dessert for about 24 bucks a person?! WOW what a deal. Especially when the fish came out they were skimpy on the fish and the fish was actually fresh! Sashimi salad was awesome had a hint of korean flavor to it. All the nigiri was awesome, my gf is a fan of uni and said the uni was not as good as fancy sushi places we go to in San Jose. We ordered a few rolls and they were pretty good too, but to get your money worth you have should order the nigiri hahaha! if we calculated all the things we ordered, we probably ordered over 200 dollars worth of sushi but only paid 100 or so.  i wish we had AYCE sushi like this in san jose.",

The quality of the fish was so low that I wonder if it is even to the standard of the sushi grade. They ran out of hamachi kama, which is totally understandable but did not even let me and husband know until 1 hour of waiting for it. I didn't eat any rolls. I was too scared. The fish itself looks scary and I wonder how anyone could ever treat their body so horribly by eating the fish here. My husband's uni looked repulsive. I literally actually felt like vomitting. This place is so crowded and busy. My husband ate a couple rolls, and he is not a picky eater but this place exceeded his tolerance of non tasty food. I will never return. Even the dessert was bad. The green tea ice cream had 0 hints of green tea and the mochi was so frozen I could not chew it. It was as if they left it in the freezer without covering it or something. Just... no. Never again.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS PLACE!  After reading Joy's review, I thought anything meant everything... without limit! But as with life... there are always limits. But it is okay! This place still rocks the house. So a week ago, me and the bf planned a date night with Yama Sushi, but the day before decided we couldn't wait!  This place isn't super easy to see because it is in a big plaza and the signage is tiny. With such wonderful reviews, I expected a fancier restaurants as with many newer sushi places these days. Nope. This place is small and simple. But simply delicious also. We took the advice of some of my fellow yelpers: we sat at the bar and did many half orders to try everything we can. Our goal was to see how much moneys worth of sushi we actually can eat, and we did pretty good! And we got to try so awesome sushi.  First off we HAD TO try their Uni, and it was a small order, but surprisingly fresh! Great taste, though of course getting it fresh from Redondo was better, but in Vegas, it is the best we can do. And then there was the giant clam! YUM! The bf doesn't usually like giant clam (from Chinese restaurants) but he really enjoyed this. But there is a limit of 1 order per person for the uni and giant clam (and sweet shrimp, but we didn't order that.) And a limit to 1 order of seafood salad per person. *picture provided*  And sushi rolls... we tried so many different ones I can't remember them all. But we did half orders instead so that we don't stuff ourselves too quickly. Had to save room for dessert! But before I knew it, I was bloated and couldn't eat anymore sushi. But I HAD TO order dessert. And I couldn't choose, so we got 1 of every flavor. *pictures posted also* Oh Em Gee the ice cream and mochi was fan-ta-bu-lous! Mango and Vanilla Mochi was incredible, and the strawberry was good too. Bummed that they didn't have the chocolate one that day. Oh well.  Overall, great food, good sushi chefs, and nice simple and clean environment. The service was good, though the servers didn't have to do much for us. I will be back for sure. And I am gonna bring everyone I know! $23 AYCE is a great deal.. and even better when the sushi is actually good!  BUT...There are a couple more stops I must make on my journey to find the best sushi in Las Vegas! Oh sushi, why do I love you so? Maybe it's the rice. Who knows.",

They really stayed on top of our refills and I do drink a lot. Ambience is great as well. Half rolls are available on all orders so you can get a great variety if you enjoy specialty rolls.

The only thing is, I don't eat seafood, so I ordered the appetizers.  We were a group of 7 and two of us didn't eat seafood, I would've liked it if they offered veggie tempura as an alternative. Everything else was fine.  If you're in the area and craving sushi, this would be a place you might enjoy. I would call ahead if you're a larger group to minimize wait time during busy times.  :)",

After running a quick Yelp search, we settle on here because it's close to the MGM Grand and offers all you can eat.  When we walked in we were greeted by happy staff and were seated immediately. It was BUSY, which is perfect when your at an all you can eat Sushi place. The food was so much better than expected and I finally got to try Uni for the first time. Everything was fresh and done to order, right down to the hibachi items.  The staff were friendly and very attentive. Always someone around to clear empty plates, refill drinks and bring more food.   Would totally recommend to anyone visiting with a big appetite for sushi.",

I wasn't big fan of scallops, but I was pretty happy with everything we ordered.  I mean we ordered all nigiri sushi (no rolls) from the menu.  Our favorite was garic tuna, saba and salmon.  See urchin was actually good as well.  Chef's super fast service was like a machine.  You have to order within 1.5 h, but we had pretty of tome to order and eat.  I highly recommend to sit at bar and order as you eat.  Otherwise, rice gets cold and fish looses flavor when you order a lot at once.  Also, you don't appreciate what you eat as much as ordering small portion at once.  And you don't have to worry about leaving leftover.  We also orderd softshell crab appetizer, but it was very soft, not much crispiness on the shell.  It was ok.  We also had plum wine, that wad very authentic flavor.  We got good buz after a glass.  We must have ordered $100 worth of food for 2, we were soooo happy after all.  :)",

    "text": "If I could sum Yama up in one word, that word would be overrated.   I feel slightly biased because I have two regular AYCE spots that I go to, but I wanted to branch out and see what else the world has to offer in terms of sushi and Yama is a favorite among my friends, so I gave it a shot.  We came in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and were promptly seated. The servers were very attentive. We ordered the Double Dragon and No Name rolls first. They were amazing!! It was a great start to our lunch. Those were the only things that are keeping this review in the positive. Everything seemingly went downhill from there.   Every other roll we ordered after the first two mentioned were not good. Slimy in texture and a little overdone. The Volcano roll had huge chunks of cucumber that really took away from the entire roll. We couldn't finish and were okay with the fact that we would have to pay extra. Our bill came and we were charged for the Volcano roll - they charged us $12.95 for a roll listed at $9.99 on the menu. The price was adjusted with no problem, but the fact that something like that could happen leaves a bad taste in my mouth, just like their sushi did.  Needless to say, I didn't find Yama special at all and I won't eat here again.",

We came with a big group of more than 10 and we were quickly seated because we got there early right when they opened.   Most of their sushi comes with roll which including the sashimi and rice together. So it's pretty easy to get full. All their portion is pretty big as well. We ended up ordered too many fishes but we still finished them. Lol all dishes were pretty fresh and warm. I like their oyster and fried shrimps.   Overall, pretty nice restaurant with good environment especially for all you can eat in Vegas. If you want all you can eat in Vegas, it's pretty much more expensive compare to this one. So if you like Asian food definitely recommended.",

Menu items such as the Man-whore, Harry Potter or Son of the Beach and appetizers including the Agadashi Tofu, seaweed salad and the incomparable Seafood Salad (with the creamy and the mild) kept me coming back. If you're in the area and there's no ridiculous wait, I do recommend it. There's always the Spring Mountain location as well.",

My salmon came out warm in the center where the rest of my roll was cold which has me a bit concerned as to how long the fish was out.  Next, i get you need to get people in and out but they are so grabby. I literally put my miso soup bowl down and it was picked up in a Nano second. This is not a place to come in to relax and hang out with friends.  The miso soup was good and my mochi. Other than that i think all the hype got my expectations way above what they could deliver.  Sorry yama , but i won't be returning.",

We came in on January 4th right before lunch ended, and we noticed quickly how different the waitress treated us and another table next to ours. She didn't smile at us, she got irritated when we requested something, and she sent out food to them faster even though we got there at the same time. But for the other table (they were obnoxious as well) she catered to them and gave them significantly better service than us. She made sure the other table was satisfied, but when it came to us, she just ignored us and got annoyed when my friend asked her what the dish was. If she's reading this, I hope you learn how to treat your customers equally.",

This place harbors such a broad range of memories for me: from experiencing my first all-you-can-eat-sushi to my Aussie cousin & me pretending we're on The Amazing Race forced to eat everything on our plates in order to get our next clue (WOOP WOOP to fellow TAR fans!!!! You KNOW what's up!!!) to my tragic break-up with my Marine to screaming profanities with a former Bestie over sake bombs. I know Yama will keep the great sushi and the great memories coming.   The service is to be matched. The entire staff is friendly and accommodating and must be vampires because I get my orders so quickly. I love ordering the seafood salad, sushi: albacore, yellowtail and smoked salmon; and practically every single roll. Then for dessert, no matter how STUFFED I am I ALWAYS get mochi. Check out my tip.  The only downside is the place is very small and cramped. If you can tolerate not only gazing into your dining companion's eyes but the table to your left and maybe even your right's eyes then by all means hypnotize them all with your \"smize\"! & test your listening and concentration skills because it'll be tempting to listen in on the convos of other tables while looking intrigued with your dining companion's squawking.",

When we arrived, we were told we would need to wait \"about 5 minutes\" for our table (our entire party was present). We ended up waiting well over 15-20 minutes and since there was no inside seating we were forced to wait in the scathing Vegas heat.   All but one persons in our party ordered AYCE. I will say that their AYCE is affordable and the limit is 2 hours, which is nice. But, they never brought out a roll that I requested, even after reminding them when everyone else had their food but me. At the end of the meal, I still hadn't gotten the forgotten roll, but by that point, I was ready to head out for birthday drinks.  Overall, pretty meh. Nothing to write home about and certainly not worth standing out in the 115 degree heat for 20 minutes.",

They are more likely to perfect your order and especially if you customize your rolls like I do. My favorite item on the menu is the Seafood Salad (mild). It has such flavor on each of the assorted fish. It also comes with radish, which gives it an amazing crunch. Every roll is described perfectly. You won't have any surprises. If you're having trouble finding good quality fish, head to Yama.",

I just ordered the two rolls I typically get and also a side of garlic tuna sashimi. The sushi chef argued with me trying to tell me I can't have the sashimi even though I'm not doing AYCE, telling me I'd be spending too much money and to not order it? Like I'm just trying to order what I want ya know and he was trying to tell me no or something like I was just not allowed to do it. I know what I'm getting into here, I'm aware that I'd be spending maybe $8 more by ordering this way. I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

    "text": "TLDR: AYCE available, unassigned wait staff, drinks not included.   Yama Sushi is located in a strip mall, but the interior definitely does not match the exterior appearance. The staff is identified not by names, but by numbers evidenced by their blue pins. I have never had to ask for my drinks to be refilled as the wait staff is excellent. This is one of the few restaurants that presents a donburi, even if it is a commercially prepackaged wipe. Their fish is acceptable, but nothing exciting stands out.   Appetizers are pretty consistent and plentiful. Their agedashi tofu is unusually fried and not pleasant to enjoy. They have salmon and hamachi kama which is large, but not the best quality. On the two occasions which I've dined, the appetizers came at the same time as the sushi and rolls, even though they are ordered at the same time.   I tried the Ellen roll, the only roll that is limited to one per person. It is wrapped in green soy paper and with plenty of fish. It's not worth it, in my opinion. Stick with the nigiri and sushi. They say that rice is supposed to define the quality of the sushi, and not just the fish. In my opinion, the sushi rice leaves much to be desired.  I would come back, although it would have be on a different occasion.",

It's $27 per person for dinner so we decided to take advantage of that so we ordered a lot of nigiris right of the bat. And man they were so fresh.   Since we were sat at the sushi bar we got enough attention from the sushi chef, which was a good thing because you want your food to be there faster. Plus he was also very helpful.   I tried Uni for the first time ever and I thought it was okay. Not my favorite sushi but it's decent.

Even as far as AYCE places go this was not worth the $25 per person. I would have gladly paid twice as much for even half decent fish. The specialty rolls were completely masked with the spiciest sauce I've ever had on sushi, probably to hide the old fish. The nigiri was so fishy and old tasting I barely ate any. Our table ate more mediocre salad than anything else to save our stomachs from the bad fish.   To top it all off, my friend got the worst runs ever all night from this place. It totally ruined her night and she ended up having to stay in the hotel room and recuperate instead of hanging out with us.   Boooo Yama sushi! Shame on you.",

We waited about 12 minutes to be seated. Servers were attentive in taking orders and giving suggestions. They also refilled our drinks well.   They make your food as you order them, instead of a typical buffet. We had miso soup, shrimp tempura, agedashi tofu and mild seafood salad as appetizers. Me and my mom were surprised with the quality of the food that they serve, since it's a smorgasbord type of thing. The tofu and tempura had a light crisp coating matched with some sweet salty sauce. We had some salmon, saba, white tuna, uni and sweet shrimp sushi. All of them had a nice amount of protein. The rice had the perfect blend of tartness from the rice vinegar balanced with the natural sweetness of rice and a bit of sugar. It was also cooked al dente.   For dessert, we had green tea ice cream, which also took our breath away, literally from being stuffed and figuratively.   I'll bring my other friends next time so they can experience Yama sushi!",

    "text": "I have been here on many different occasions, this was by far the worst experience I have had. We arrived early and we're sat right away. The waitresses were very friendly. We ordered the all you can eat.  We placed out first order (seafood salad, sweet shrimp, tempura vegetables) we never received the shrimp. The sea food salad was full of salmon and was lacking everything else, maybe had 1 small piece of shrimp and a little piece of tuna. The vegetables took a very long time to come out and we're not cooked through.  After about a 20 minute wait to place out next order we got (no name, you da man too, crazy jalapeno, sweet shrimp and devil roll) this time our devil roll was missing. The other rolls were very lacking in finesse and preparation, this is usually Yama's strong point.  When we finished eating the sushi we ordered a vanilla mochi, and green tea ice cream.  We waited about 10 minutes for those to come out and both were melting and had appeared to be sitting for some time.   Overall we did not have a very good experience that night, Yama's main head chef must have had the day off because the standards were very below par. The waiting crew was good but seemed to lack leadership. just for the sake of saying everyone has a bad day, I'm giving then 3 stars. I would recommend coming here on the weekends just not at 6 on a thursday.",

    "text": "Superb AYCE! And I am talking nigiri sushi, not the Americanized rolls. The fish are always bigger than the rice, and tastes pretty fresh. Well, as fresh as you could get in the middle of desert anyway.   This place have a good spread of selections - salmon, white tuna, albacore, red snapper, mackerel etc so you can explore the distinct taste of different fish. They also have uni (sea urchin) and sweet shrimp (raw body with tempura head, which is kind of creepy but delicious) but we get only one order each. With many other varieties, this doesn't bother much. If you are almost full and want to avoid rice, you can get the seafood salad. It's several type of raw fish cut in large cubes drenched in sweet and sour sauce. It's delicous! One serving can get you pretty filled up. For me, this is the highlight of this AYCE.   Dinner AYCE is 23.95 and must be eaten within 2 hours. If you are like me, that is plenty of time to slowly devour your catch while sharing few earth-shattering gossips at the table. The place is always crowded, but it only took me 5-10 minutes to get table. I sit at the sushi bar, so it was easy to order directly to the sushi master. One comment though, the sushi masters are all non-friendly. They look fierce so ordering was like a student asking for a toilet break.      With the price and quality of sushi, I will totally come again.",

We shared everything and I think sharing among two or three is perfect as you have to pay for anything that's left on the plate.  5* Seafood salad appetizer - shared one; regret not ordering the second dish we were allowed 5* Hamachi Kama, the collar of yellowtail fish - grilled, fantastic - great to have hot food break during a sushi buffet 5* Tamago nigiri - I love tamago so maybe biased 4* fried soft shell crab 4* deep fried mussel 4* raw shimp with fried shrim head 4* salmon nigiri 3* Uni - dull dark orange color, not very fresh 3* Mochi mango ice cream 3* quail egg nigiri 2* some sushi roll with a bunch of cream cheese - it was a mistake ordering any sushi roll when you have better options 2* Plum ice cream *** forgot a few other items and I can't find a complete menu",

Sweet shrimp amaebi was a misnomer because the texture and slight sweetness was not there.   Even in premium supermarkets, amaebi is $17 each! So I doubt yama will use real sweet shrimp.  Seafood salad was great,  basically a sashimi salad.  Star of the night was the Hamachi kama.  Tender meat perfect with the dipping sauce.  All in all, goyemon beats them with just the quality of fish.",

I'm super super picky about my sushi so if I ate it, it had to be pretty good!    I was a little disappointed in the what seemed to be lack of selection for the AYCE menu.  The rolls on the regular menu seemed much more appetizing than what we were offered, but for the good price, beggars can't be choosers right?

    "text": "It is with great sadness and a deep sense of loss that I must amend my previous rating of what was once the best sushi in all of Vegas. Once rated a 5 star, it now lies more around the 3 star range.    To be sure, the crowds are still lining up for a seat at this one-time fine establishment, but one wonders if the restaurant's popularity may have contributed to its current downfall.  Since my last review of Yama, the place has certainly gotten a lot busier. But management has not responded well to the rush of new business.   Here is a few things that have gone very wrong at Yama: * The fish is no longer fresh. Rather than cutting the fish from the filet as it is ordered, they pre-cut several hundreds of pieces at a time - and the quality of the fish has suffered immensely, with most pieces having a soft, slimy film covering them. * The place is way too crowded. Rather than focusing on a great dining experience, management has decided to try and cram as many people as possible along the bar and around the tables. Turnover seems to be the most important factor. If I didn't know any better, I would say they have added seats to accommodate more customers in the same sized space. * The chefs are rushing. It appears as though the place has completely abandoned the 'Art' of sushi in favor of speed and efficiency. They give little regard to the presentation and balance of the dishes. Far too many times I have been handed a plate that has way too much or way too little of something, like so much vinegar on the roll that the rice crumbles at the slightest touch.  Be sure that these issues were not a factor for the many years I have enjoyed Yama - that is until recently. Hopefully there is still time to fix them.   Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Yama's success - I just wish it was not at the expense of what made them great to begin with.",

I had that same feeling, and someone told me to just be a little carefree. Risk that ocean biological neuro-toxin, motor control is overrated anyways! Once you get beyond that initial hesitation and you come inside, you'll be glad you did.   The prices are amazing, and unlike many (read almost all) all you can eat sushi joints, every roll is not on top of the artificial crab California roll...which is a great, great, great thing since artificial crab gets real old real quick and is such an over powering and pungent flavor that no matter what you put on top of it, if it's the third or later roll with a cali base, all you'll taste if fake crab.  So based on my extensively perfectly researched and developed rating system Yama gets a solid 4 stars. The service is good, the quality is good, and I really like it. However, the ambiance is a little awkward with only Japanese paper walls separating dinning tables...hello overhearing of someone's medical problems...Other than that if you're near UNLV and have a BIG sushi craving, hit me up and let's pig out!",

Our drink orders were taken and delivered within minutes. It took a couple of minutes for our waitress to come introduce herself, but you need that time to look over their menu. When she did come around, she was helpful and gave good suggestions.  We ordered the a bunch of rolls and they were all good, but drowning in sauce. Every roll on the list comes with some kind of dressing, and they do not go light here. In fact, everything on the menu comes with something on or on the side for dipping. The nigiri were enormous blocks of rice topped with an equally frightening slab of fish. I prefer my nigiri to be on the smaller side and will order more if I want. The overall taste was good, but I wonder how I would feel if I had the chance to taste the fish alone.",

    "text": "I started coming to Yama Sushi back in 2004. When my wife and I started dining here, there was usually like 2 or 3 people there and is was quiet and very personal. Now there is consistently a line to get in.  It is possibly the best AYCE place in town. The menu is huge but it does not need to be on the menu for you to order. You want something special just ask and they accommodate. All the appetizers are included and the beer is cheap. The service is STILL personable and exceptional even with it being crowded all the time. The food comes fast and most important is that everything is fresh. I have never ever smelled the fish when walking in to the restaurant.  This place is a hole in the wall dive with no frills just awesome food and great friendly service.  I keep trying a few new places closer to me but find that I continually compare them to Yama and no one meets the same standard.",

I had several of the sushi pieces, the fish is fresh, firm and just as it should be. The rice is cooked well. However, this a personal choice, I like a little bit of the vinegar on the rice to give it a subtle sourness to compliment the sweetness of the fish. The rice felt like well done steamed rice. It's a matter of choice. It absolutely beats the sushi served at most buffets on the strip. If you love sushi, this is a must try in Las Vegas.",

We actually got a mini table for 2 right next to the door,  crammed in a corner, right away. This was definitely interesting. Nonetheless, the servers were quick on their toes and our water cups were full during our entire visit. Quality of Sushi wasn't bad. I really liked it actually. The only thing that bothered me a little bit was the big cuts of fish on the Nigiris, and the big chunk of rice under the fish.

We stumbled upon it by mistake, I think we might have seen an advertisement for it either that or we yelped it.  I just remember the interesting names of the rolls (manwhore roll, sticks out the most loll) and the fact that everything we ate was delicious.    So why the two star review?  Fast forward to edc weekend 2013 and I came here again with my boyfriend.  I was telling him about how good this place was because I had it before.  He loves sushi, and he's very picky about his sushi places.  This time around, it just was not good anymore.  I think it is because this time we focused more on nigiri rather than rolls and the fish is NOT fresh at all and they pack on so much rice.  The rolls are still good, but I mean anything is going to taste good if it's deep fried and smothered in spicy mayo.  The 2010 version of me did not try the nigiri, just rolls cause I did not really eat a lot of nigiri back then, just rolls.  The 2013 version of me though, will probably not come back here.  The fish is old and horrible, and I was happy I did not get a tummy ache because that would have ruined my edc plans.    Oh and I like to eat my fish first before I eat the rice because I actually enjoy the taste of sushi rice.  So I had a little rice pile on my plate that I was planning on eating.  The waitress comes by and tells me that because it is all you can eat, I have to eat the rice too.  I understand that she is just doing her job, but that irritated me a little bit.",

Always making sure we were satisfied and always keeping food on our table.  We even received omiyage b/c we're from Hawaii.  MAHALO Yama Sushi !!!",

Let me tell you when we found tjis place it looked very uninviting from the outside but once we got it .it was soo packed and noticed lots of business men inside eating so that validated us to stay. We ordered AYCE for a fair price of 24 dollars and you can choose anything on menu including desert. Every roll we tried was delicious and very fresh! We sat at sushi bar and service was good .We will always stop here for sushi when we visit vegas its a must! Highly recommend just get there early or you will be waiting for awhle.",

Don't waste your money at any other sushi spot in Vegas. Eat at Yama once, and you'll never wanna eat at another sushi spot again! $25 for all you can eat, tons of choices, great staff. All your typical appetizers, all your typical rolls, sushi, and sashimi. But what puts Yama above all the others are their special rolls! Many tasty selections to choose from. You can order by the half or full roll, and most of the rolls can be rolled into the seaweed cones by request (Son of the Beach hand roll!!!).   Hands down, Yama is the best sushi spot in all of Vegas. Don't go anywhere else to satisfy your sushi fix. You'll regret it!!!",

I enjoyed the $20 all you can eat sushi lunch special, and it gives you your bang for your buck. The fish is incredibly fresh, the nigiri sushi is prepared and served quickly, and the waitstaff is friendly, attentive, and efficient. I would recommend this place for fresh sushi at a fairly reasonable price, as you can try so many options to keep you satisfied. I'm definitely coming back!",

The fish was not that fresh and they were really fast on delivering sushi to you table. Which is good if you are hungry, but if you are trying to chat with your friends than forget about a peaceful conversation.   There was an interesting incident that happened in front of our eyes. A homeless man walked into the restaurant, his jeans were torn as was his shirt. The server got him a table right across from our table and later got into a huge argument over the homeless man eating left over food from other people's plates. It was kind of embarrassing and sad, but the restaurant ended up kicking the guy out. And this is what I mean, when I say that their service was really fast and it seemed like getting customers, feeding them fast and serving new customers impacts their quality of customer service. Also, sushi quality needs a lot of improvement.",

Customer Service - Definitely up to date. They were nice enough to offer us samples which I do not believe we have to finish. Yet every time they give us those samples , it's always 2 full plate filled. Yeah , that's not why we're there though but we finished it anyway. I was not impressed how when it comes to Sushi or appetizer , we only order 1 order of each and they hand us 2. They were literally throwing food over food at us.   For desserts , they let you choose 2 flavors and you can always get any flavored mochi with it as well.   I will definitely come back.",

We are so glad we did. Being that we do not have sushi buffets in Hawai'i, you know we took advantage of that \"all you can eat\" sign we saw.  Reasonable pricing for all you can eat, and includes desserts as well? You can't go wrong at all, and if you know Hawai'i people, you know we can eat. Although, their spicy ahi(tuna) is far more spicy than home, because they don't mix mayo in it, it's still bomb ass sushi! If you're from Hawai'i and you're reading this, take a drive out here, you will not be disappointed.  Cheap prices, all you can eat, and good service! Definitely gonna come back here when in Vegas again, which we will be.",

The amount of rice was perfect. Not only was the fish buttery and melt-in-your-mouth fresh, the appetizers were equally tasty. We got the Korean barbecue short ribs, the agedashi tofu, shrimp tempura, as well as a few other items. All were well worth it. And to top it off, the service was efficient and very pleasant!",

I can't really comment how the raw fish tasted as I cannot eat it at this time, BUT the unagi was pretty good. The husband said that he enjoyed the scallop, yellowtail, uni, etc. BTW when the menu says spicy tuna/spicy crab, etc...it's pretty dang spicy! The nigri was a bit overstuffed with rice, but other than that the hubby said it was fresh. Another thing that threw me off was the there was huge stack of salmon in the cooler that was precut...gross! Mussels were a miss, but I think overall everything else was good.

What you do with AYCE is scan the two menus (one with everything on it from desserts to appetizers to hand rolls and the other with pictured specialty rolls) and order a few choices. They are delivered almost instantly! Devour those and REPEAT! I love this system even though at times it can be confusing. This place is great even though its crowded, get to know your neighbors! it can be as fun as you make it. I love the waitresses that urge you to try everything. It was my dad's first time AYCE and I'd have to say he was liking it.   Tips:  -Bring a pen to mark what you have tried!  -Drink green tea (which is included in AYCE) when you feel like you've eaten too much yet still want to go on! :D our little secret. which isn't really a secret as it is a known fact... -Ask for half-rolls when you just want to try a roll for the first time! Really saves your stomach.  -Don't skimp on the mochi and ice cream dessert at the end!...or inbetween rolls ;D",

The AYCE menu is big and it includes dessert as well!  You have to try the seafood salad, get spicy!  The flavor is amazing and it has a fresh taste that leaves you completely satisfied.    As far as rolls go I would recommend the Man Whore (this one has cooked salmon),    Whenever I leave Yama I literally feel like I gained 10 pounds from eating so much delicious sushi.  The fish is very fresh and the rolls come out very quickly!   Whether you're a Vegas local or a tourist, this place is a must!",

As I sit at the bar during lunch, management decide's it's a good idea to pull the wallpaper off and change the scenery of the restaurant.  So, as they pull the sheets off from behind the bar (literally...above the cooking stations)...dozens upon dozens of CockRoaches begin to scatter up the wall and around the bar!  I stopped my chewing and stared in utter amazement.  Really guys? ...Really?  But they didn't seem to think twice about it....because they decided to just play it off and offer everyone at the bar a free Tiger Roll as compensation...lol.  Nice try.  It sucks...because...they really did have one of the better spots in town, but I can't go back, knowing that they have a complete disregard to maintain a proper facility (note the other reviews regarding cockroaches).",

I mean one roll is like 10 bucks usually, so just ordered 3 items on the menu, you pretty much break even!  I yelped this place before we came to Vegas and was really looking forward to it.  My favorite roll was one that had cream cheese, damn I forgot the name! Wait, it was called The Wet Dream.  I guess the cream cheese represents the \"wet\" part of the dream.  Oh Yama, you so nasty!  All the other rolls we tried were okay.  One thing I didn't enjoy was that most of the rolls have raw fish on them.  I'm not a huge fan of raw fish sushi.  I don't know why, I'll eat it, but it just tastes....rather raw...  The service was a little weird, we had like 10 different girls coming to our table, so nobody really seemed to keep track of what we were waiting for.  That was odd.  I did enjoy this place, but next time I come to Vegas, I'll probably look up a different sushi place.",

I had expectations for this place from all the reviews and a friend reassuring me its the best in town... if that's the best in town its a pretty slack standard...  The service is good. The hostess was prompt, a little unorganized, confusing the order of names for people waiting to be seated, (which could have been solved by simply using numbers...) Don't fire her for this she's cute.  Jokes aside lets get down to what was not impressive.  While getting seated I ordered their soft shell crab appetizer, as recommended by a fellow yelper. Disappointed that it was heavily breaded, overcooked, it wasn't a nice golden brown, but a dark-borderline singed brown, the sauce that accompanied it didn't compliment it all. I decided to just hastily consume the food and down it with my drink.  I love spicy tuna and its many variations, but was extremely disappointed at how flat it tasted! No tang, no kick, no flavor, just the rice. Moving onto the soft shell crab, there's was no prominence in its taste, the crab lacked significant flavor to make me say, hey this is crab! & it tastes great! None of that.  Moving to my third & fourth set, came the \"devil\" & the \"you the man\" rolls, the devil roll flat out failed when it touched my palate why give it such a name if it fails to deliver. The next roll faired a little better, its doesn't go all the way to impress but stops short of uncertainty. The jalapeno sauce gives it a mild tinge of attitude, but for its contents, it just doesn't hit the mark.  Man Whore. The idea of taking a sushi and coating it with cheese and throwing it in the oven was most appealing. The first roll went down smoothly and I thought this night was going to turn with this roll. Come the second roll it just abruptly ended with a wtf! I suddenly found myself trying to figure out the weird mound of meat on top of my roll, wth is it exactly, cutting corners/cost using ground beef/pork/chicken? Where's the fish? Why does it feel like I'm eating someone's leftovers...  Last roll for the night. Before calling it a night & grabbing my disgusting check, I was greeted by my final plate, dubbed the \"No Name\" by the person making my sushi. Tuna & Salmon wrapped in a green something...(assuming this is lettuce), coated with jalapeno sauce & God knows what else. As this was a custom creation, it felt that it had more character & creativity involved, it was a well balanced morsel, a hint tang, a mild spike and a dash of sweetness. Thank you for that Mr.Jun  In closing, wth you're still reading this...go find another sushi place if you're looking for something special or something that doesn't taste flat.",

Well worth it, just make sure to try and eat every thing as its made as you order. I heard they may charge you more if you just waste food. I started doing half orders now that I go solo when I get the craving. But I recommend starting with the seafood Salad. Mmmmmhhhm. I went from a hater to a lover of sushi because of Yama. I wish I could give this a 5 star but honestly, I've only had like 10 different sushi places and never on the coast. Plus after watching \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" an awesome documentary on Netflix, I now believe there is a better sushi out there that will blow my mind... Not in the desert though.  This film gave  me a better understanding and deeper appreciation for sushi. Japan is in the bucket list to enjoy the best Sushi in the planet!

We got full after that and ordered half rolls (AWESOME)  To finish our night off, we got 3 orders of Mochi, Mango, Strawberry and vanilla.

I was once asked by a server not to ask the chef for tempura but I didn't see the waiter for a bit and I love shrimp tempura! The next time I went there the girls asked us what we would like to drink and thats all she asked us. I did'nt want to bother so I just order items like rolls. The waitress came by to refresh water but never NEVER asked me what I would like to order. My boyfriend sat there and watched me be to shy to order from her.",

    "text": "Reno has a lot of all you can eat sushi (AYCE) restaurants. However my good friend recommended we go to this AYCE while we were in Vegas. The restaurant feels small with cozy, but we didn't feel like we were ever crowded or bunched up. The servers and sushi chefs were proficient and provided great services. This restaurant also had a lot of options that Reno's restaurants don't have.  First off it was about $20 for AYCE and everything on the menu was included. I, myself ordered items on the menu that I knew wouldn't be able to get in Reno. Some of those items were Takoyaki (wheat flower based batter filled with minced octopus), Hamachi Kama (hamachi collar), and Uni (sea urchin). My friend also mentioned that he always orders their gyoza (potstickers).   Their sushi rolls were delicious, but for me I made sure to get my money's worth with those unique items. My favorite was the Hamachi Kama because the collar part of the fish tends to be the most fatty and juicy part. The meat was buttery and very flavorful.   I'm glad my friend mentioned this restaurant because I definitely left feeling full and happily satisfied.",

This location is very out dated, seats are too close together, menus look like they've never been cleaned, walls just look like filth which is a turn off.  My normal order is wet dream, I ordered it here and they slapped a chunk of cream cheese onto it. When I order it at spring mountain it's melted into the roll. I ordered something simple as edamame and it was hard as a rock. Not the soft salty as usual. Clearly recipes aren't being followed. Salmon also is never available at any location I eat at? Why is it on the menu if you guys don't want to serve it?? Very frustrating.   Customer service is just as bad, many females talking gossip at the register while one Asian waitress runs around taking everyone's order. She was the best part of this place. I definitely do not recommend this location. Very disappointing not worth the money.",

We found a bone in one of our pieces and the pieces are unevenly thick.    Something has changed with this location. Years ago it used to be one of my favorites.

This flamingo location appears to be smaller than the location on spring mountain.  The reason I gave this location 4 stars is because the sushi just did not play up to par. It seemed like every roll we ordered was a standard California roll topped with different toppings. The salmon nigiri was perfect but the tuna nigiri was embarrassing. Either the fish was not sliced nicely or it was a very low quality tuna that was used. It was like chewing on rubber. The salmon kama, on the other hand, was delicious. They did run out of it right after I ordered my share.  Not much of a dessert option here.  Just different flavors of mochi ice cream and flavored ice cream.  Maybe it was just an off night because we have been here before for lunch and everything was delicious. Regardless, I'm sure we'll be back. My family from Kauai love the AYCE option since that's not available there.",

However on my latest visit the fish quality has degraded much more than before, and it's very noticeable. The fish to rice Ratio is no longer the same as it was before. The quality of the fish is also not as good anymore. The cut is of a lower quality, and the uni was not fresh.   Service was good, things came out pretty quick.

Lots of no good people hanging around the area... I'm sure it's drug dealing.. kinda scary. Had a guy walk up to us and ask us for a dollar while we were just getting out of our Uber.  The restaurant is very small... tables are wayyyy too close to each other. You will feel claustrophobic eating here. I literally had a partition right next to the next table.  Especially since it is AYCE, they give you a very small table so you CAN'T AYCE.  They had a lot of items on menu, some are very vulgar... ex: wet dream sushi roll and a few others. If I didn't know this was a sushi place, the menu could pass for a happy hour massage parlor.  Well, we ordered a few things, and when the food came out, they weren't even our rolls.  Also, they have lots of rules here, that if you order, and leave left overs, they will charge you full price. I totally get that, but since I didn't order the rolls that came to my table, I shouldn't be responsible for it right?  Well, more rolls and food came, wasn't ours. Again. The table right next to us, got two dishes, and said that those weren't theirs... comes to find out, it was ours.  This happens throughout our whole dine in experience. Wrong food to tables. Staff was very sloppy and rushed... and the food was not that good. The quality of the food was not worth me paying $20 for lunch AYCE.  I'm sad to give this place such bad reviews, but it was just really bad. I'm shocked at how many people gave it good reviews. I was def disappointed. Needless to say, they got our money and we didn't get to eat our moneys worth. My husband even said he will take his loss bc the food and service was horrible.  Only positive thing was, their mango mochi was delish. That's it. :(",

Food quality is still 10/10! We had sea urchin, salmon, red and yellow snapper, yellowfin tuna, and several others off the all you can eat menu, and the quality was superb. Will definitely be back in the next week or so!",

Despite the seating being entirely open, the hostess put us directly next to another couple, actually sharing a table that had a plastic divider in the middle. Needless to say we stood up and moved to one of the many 2-tops open. She also gave us one menu, so that we had to pull a chair around and both cram together to try to share it. We had to ask the waitress for another menu, because neither of us can read upside down.  We tried 5 different rolls and two appetizers. We didn't enjoy any of it. We didn't have breakfast so we were starving, so that's saying quite a bit about the food quality. If you order any rolls with cucumbers, make sure to ask for them without - they'll put giant slabs of cucumber in the roll that really ruin it. The baked mussels were rubbery and just had thick, uncooked mayonnaise slabbed onto them.  Gf found a fishbone in her roll; that's not something you want to bite into and puncture your gums with. Completely unacceptable.",

I heard every beep, staple, and numerous conversations of servers. It was totally distracting and annoying. What made it worse was seeing all the space on the other side of the restaurant. Get rid of that table location!   Now, the food was very good. It was worth the price. Try the deep fried mussels and Crab on a Stick. The no name roll had a bit of a kick in a good way. I don't think any of the food will disappoint.",

Lunch is reasonably priced at $20.95, and one order of uni and one piece of sweet shrimp is also included in that price. However, the uni did not taste very fresh, and the color was brown when it was served to me. Yuck!   The menu here is very standard. They offer the usual nigiri and rolls along with some appetizers. The only thing that really grabbed my attention was how sexual some of the rolls were worded such as wet dream and kiss the ass. The nigiri wasn't the best quality, but what do you expect at an ayce place? I was hoping they had more appetizers like ramen or udon that some ayce sushi places offer these days. The hamachi kama was really good, but they limit you to one order with the ayce.   Service was excellent. All the servers were friendly and accommodating and on top of our orders. Additionally, my water was constantly being re-filled. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't that great for me to want to come back.",

    "text": "There's nothing horrible or offensive about this place, but I'll probably never go here again. And I would never recommend it to anyone when you have other similarly priced ayce sushi options all over Vegas. So that's why the rating is so low.   First, the service was great. Some of the best service I've had at an ayce place. They seemed happy to have us there, and were pretty attentive.   But good service can't overcome meh food. Their offerings generally reminded me of something I'd find at a cheaper traditional buffet where you grab your own food.   The only items that rose above that were the Hamachi kama (grilled? yellowtail collar), the salmon kama, and the green tea ice cream.   The house salad reminded me of the stuff you buy out of the bag at the grocery store. I can understand it if you don't think salad is a big deal but I literally can't think of an ayce place I've been to with salad that bad. The tonkatsu and soft shell crab were both dry and it was a chore to finish one small order. The short ribs were some of the worst I've had - chewy and overly sweet, reminiscent of jerky.   I tried the Harry potter, the sun of the beach, the double dragon roll, and one other I can't remember off the top of my head. The sauce overwhelmed to the point I couldn't really enjoy the other ingredients in the roll.   If you're on a sushi tour through Vegas, I'd recommend skipping this stop.",

His waitress ran outside and yelled \"was the food not good, was the service not good?!\". I've never heard of this happening anywhere else before. And to my recollection, he stated that the answer to one or both of those questions was \"yes\".",

    "text": "I expected a wait before we got here, from previous reviews I had read... and they were right. This is not a place to go to if you are in a hurry. They were not able to give us a wait time, but in the end we ended up only waiting about 15 minutes before the manager seated us, although groups of 3-4 that were there before us were still waiting outside. I think they were so busy that the host didn't realize there was an open table until the manager whisked us over there.  Also, all of the staff there looked like they hated working there and were not the most pleasant. The sushi here is the AMAZING! It all tasted fresh and was very flavorful. We ended up going with the all you can eat sushi, but in the end didn't end up eating as much as the a la carte cost would have been, but only short by a couple of dollars. If you can eat a lot then definitely go for the unlimited option! I wish they would include the ice cream  and drinks in the all-you-can- eat price, like they do with the appetizers. We hope to make it out here again in a couple of months, but as there are so many different dining options in Las Vegas we will see if the wait is worth it again.",

Loved the tempura, BBQ ribs, agedashi tofu and gyoza. The nigiri sushi was fresh and delicious. Rolls were yummy as well - be careful though since some of them are really heavy and can fill you up quite a bit! My favorite roll was sun of a beach.   Yama gets really busy so be prepared for a long wait. I came on a Friday night and waited a hour during prime dining hours. The service is fairly quick when you do get seated though!",

We both opted for all-you-can-eat sushi for $26.95, which was a reasonable deal for the amount of sushi we eat!  What I like about Yama Sushi is that the size of the servings is PERFECT!  The sushi is not overly filled, and you can even order half-orders if you want to try several different rolls!  Many other all-you-can-eat sushi places try to fill you up and only allow you to order a couple of rolls before you literally have to roll out of the restaurant.  Yama Sushi is not like that.  Additionally, the servers were extremely friendly and helpful here!  I was asking the server if they had a california roll topped with spicy tuna, and she said it was not on the menu, but the chef would be happy to make it!  The servers were always present to refill our water and ask us if we wanted to order anything new.  Although the quality of the sushi is fresh and delicious here, they did not offer as large or unique of a selection as other sushi restaurants.  Yes, I know the names are unique, but looking beyond that... The only sushi I distinctly remember eating here was the \"Yo Mama,\" and that was my absolute favorite roll!  All in all, I would definitely return to this restaurant because of the convenience of the half-order rolls and the accommodating service.  However, it was not the best sushi I've had in Las Vegas.",

I rarely go anywhere else because $21-$25 for AYCE sushi (depending on whether it's lunchtime or dinnertime) is such a great deal.  The place is always packed, but I have never been disappointed with the service. Occasionally a waiter will forget a roll, but when you're ordering 5+ rolls at a time, what do you expect? They're so quick, you can have a new roll out in just a few minutes.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a yummy AYCE sushi spot.",

We were looking for some fantastic local food away from the strip, and had to try this place considering all of the YELP reviews. We arrived at 3 minutes before 6:00 p.m., just at the cutoff of the Happy Hour special. Fortunately, the waiter rushed us to our table and got an order in for us so our ticket would be clocked in before 6:00 p.m.! Nice!  Our waiter was extremely attentive, knowledgable, and very nice. He made sure our waters were always full. My boyfriend ordered only 1 beer, but our waiter took such a liken to us, that he would bring him another beer (for FREE!), three more times! Wow!!!   The head chef visited our table as well, and asked if we had tried his signature dish yet. Why no, we haven't!!! He ordered for our table a plate of yellowtail sashimi with sauce (for FREE), for us to try. All this, while knowing that we are from Orlando and won't be a repeat customer anytime soon.   The fresh was surprisingly extremely fresh, I mean, we are in the desert here! Happy Hour has some incredible deals and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  We were charmed by the staff and how pleasant and attentive they were to us!!! We can't say enough about how please we were with the service, on top of, the spectacular food!",

It's reasonably priced at $23ish dollars a person for AYCE (sorry I don't have the exact price) but it's definitely worth it.  They only give an order of Uni and Sweet shrimp to each person, which is fine considering those are the \"expensive\" types of sushi. I personally loved the Yellowtail and Spicy Tuna handroll.

It's tuna and salmon sashimi over (I'm not sure if it is daikon) veggie noodles and topped with a sauce of your choice of spiciness and shrimp tempura. The wet dream roll is out of this world! If I start to name off rolls, I would never end this review. Every time that we have been here, we've ordered different rolls and have loved what they bring. I definitely have this sushi spot as one of the top sushi places I'll go to.  Bring people to help you!! I always go with my BFF, she's all I need.. or we'll go in our usual girl group.

Anywho I was determined to try this place so we put our name on the waiting list and walked around the shopping center ( TJ Max ) haha. So it's finally time to eat and the host (one to take our reservations) was a little monotone and somewhat of a downer. But other than that everyone was nice. Orders came out fast and tasted pretty good. We ordered smoked salmon, tuna, salmon, tuna, and some rolls. Taste wise everything was on point and also they do half orders so you can try everything :) the downside was that my sushi was not cut properly the pieces were so big that I couldn't just one bite it. I would have to take like 2-3 bites and that would cause a mess. But yeah taste wise it lived up to its expectations. I would come back again but only on a slower day. Because the restaurant being filled to full occupancy caused some mistakes and delays. Took 30 minutes to receive our ice cream and Mochi. Also the server spilled water in our orders. And some appetizers were forgotten :/",

    "text": "I'm no sushi connoisseur but I know when I taste crappy fish. I'm no restaurateur but even I know that good customer service is the way you make fans and have them come back. I'm not a picky y eater but Yama was just clearly unacceptable.   This restaurant is super tiny. I'm not hating on the size of the restaurant but when the tables are so close together that you can hear the conversations of those around you more than your own, then this becomes a problem. Getting in between tables to take a seat was a near impossible mission in as well. By no means am I a large individual but I had to suck in pretty hard to get to my chair.   Our waitress was prompt in getting our drink orders. Two waters. She took my friend's AYCE order and started to walk away. Umm, hello?! What about my order? We called her back to order my lunch special - veggie tempura, 4 pieces of sushi, rice, miso soup and salad.   After about 5 minutes, we finally got our waters. Mine had a black speck in it. My friend and I were convinced that it looked like a dead bug, resembling a gnat. The waitress insisted that this \"gnat\" was a green tea leaf. Whether a bug or a green tea leaf, nothing should be floating around in my water.   I let the water fiasco slide and ordered a diet coke. No joke, I waited about 15 minutes for it. My friend and I asked three different waitresses for my beverage. I was parched! Not only this, my friend got his sushi but wasn't given his wasabi and ginger. This also took about 15 minutes in addition to kindly asking three different waitresses. Mind you, it was not busy - there were empty tables around the restaurant.   The fish was dry and had a rubbery consistency. I felt as though it was left out for a while. While my friend and I were trying our best to enjoy the not-so-yummy fish, my friend found a hair in the ginger. That was the end of our meal. Dunzo. FInito.   Vegas has some of the best AYCE sushi and Yama is NOT one of them. Needless to say, I won't be back.",

    "text": "Here for lunch with my family. I would give it a 0 stars if I could. All the rolls were super tiny. The shrimp tempura roll had no shrimp in it but fired batter. My 2 kids both ordered shrimp tempura, one came before the other, one came with the normal 6-8 shrimps. But the second one came and there was 3. Wth? Did someone eat it on the way? And the fully art was it was being served next to another tray of shrimp tempura that was full! The sashimi I had send me to the bathroom with diarrhea 1 min after consuming. And of course couldn't finish my 2 rolls I ordered because I lost my appetite. To be honest normally family of 4 can kill 2 roll easy, but the food was just too nasty. I couldn't revenge ask my family to do that. And it's not about the mo why, but restaurant usually charges more because they add things to the dinner menu, but there is no different selection you get for having dinner there. This is the worse place yelp has lead me to.",

A roll, and a bunch of eel or tuna or something...) They usually only bring me just the roll, or just the sushi. Never both. *Never* both. They just give me one, and I never see the other part.  Or --like the last time -- none of my order.   The last time I went, I was in a group of four. The other three guys in that group were on their second round. I hadn't received a single thing. I'm just sitting there, waiting. I bring it up to the waitress, she goes to \"look\" for it, returning five minutes later to refill water. (Without food, nor a single word about my order.)   The other guys were just about done, when the waitress (out of pity?) brings me *someone else's* order that they didn't wind up wanting. By this time, I had ordered at least or or five things (over the course of an hour), and not a single thing was delivered. When I asked to speak with the manager, \"the manager\" (whom I maintain was just another waitress --she was too young and too combative off the bat to be a real manager) claimed that everything had arrived to my table.   \"You were given everything you ordered.\"   \"Uhm... no I haven't.\"   Rest of the table: \"LOL, no he hasn't! He hasn't received a single plate of food he's ordered!\"  \"Yes you did. We have the ticket!\"   \"Then why am I hungry after an hour? Why would I bother you about this at an AYCE restaurant, if I had --in fact-- eaten? That doesn't make any sense!\" (This detail still perplexes me, to this day.)  The \"manager\" left in a huff, never to return.   We had to leave around then, to be on time for plans we had later in the evening. I paid the bill in full, and left hungry. I'm *still* mad about that, to be honest.   This place is popular, but there are better places in town.",

    "text": "It was OK.  To be fair, I'm from Hawaii so we are very fortunate to have an abundance of fresh fish available to us every day.  Why sushi in Vegas?  IDK, sometimes you get tired of the hotel buffets and steak houses.  My normal staple of Ikura, hamachi, and uni was ok.  Because of UPS/Fedex, you can get fresh fish anywhere in the world.  They just didn't have it here that day.  What I did love was the salmon skin rolls.  Wow.  Talk about crunch on the outside and crunch on the inside.  Those were pretty awesome and I ate about a half dozen of those.  Something I would caution is the \"white tuna\" that they serve.  As I said, being from Hawaii we see a lot of fish.  Never heard of it though I'm not a fisherman.  It was the most expensive nigiri on the menu so we ordered it to see what it was about.  It was drowned in a ponzu sauce so not sure about the taste.  It was white, seemed like it was cooked(?), and it was...different.  The next day, after my friend had the shits, we googled white tuna.  Yikes.  Not sure which on ewe got but it wasn't good.  I was ok but I have an Andrew Zimmern stomach.  Probably won't return but if I did, I'd stick to the salmon skin rolls.",

Since its an AYCE spot, they have a lot of rules (must finish all your food, no sharing, etc. otherwise they will charge) but that's expected.

We finally made our way there and tried the AYCE, and all I can say was it was only alright. Pros: the menu for AYCE had a LOT of items to choose from, so that was awesome. We went with a large party - all ordering AYCE - so we basically got to try every roll there. The Seafood Salad was pretty good. Cons: A lot of the rolls were very similar in taste, so nothing stood out as exceptional.   Probably won't make any special trip to eat here again, but otherwise, not bad.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite AYCE sushi joint in Las Vegas. I have to go here at least once a month. Dinner is something like $25 to $26 dollars but includes everything on the menu, including appetizers. There are a few things you can only get one order of however.   One of those things is the \"seafood salad\" which is a must have. If you like Sashimi, you will like the seafood salad. Don't let the term salad scare you. It is literally just a plate piled high with different types of raw fish covered in either a spicy or a creamy sauce. No vegetables to be seen. I also recommend the \"no name roll.\"  Overall the quality of the sushi is pretty good. This is a place I would go and order food A la carte. The fact that it is all you can eat is incredible. If you haven't been here and like sushi, do yourself a favor and try it out.  My only two complaints are long wait times (it is a medium size restaurant, so popular times are usually pretty packed) and drunk homeless people (it is located in kind of a sketchy strip mall, so if you are outside waiting for your table be prepared to be accosted by people begging for money or drunks mumbling to themselves).",

Last weekend my husband and I went, and asked to be seated at the bar, which had two vacant seats. Instead, I was told they're being held for a party of four... (along with a rude customer who injected his two cents into the conversation, despite the fact that no one was talking to him in the first place) Sit your damned party of four at a fucking table! ee  While those seats sat empty for 30 minutes (which we would have been pretty much done by then), we waited outside, then moved in to the bench there. Another 15 minutes passed and a few parties of two were called to be seated, and we noticed that they had come in after us. Finally one group said \"Um, they were here before us...\" and the guy went \"Oh! I'm sorry. I lost the paper with your name on it.\"   Right.... you're holding it in your fucking hand.   I ended up speaking with the manager, who made things right with an apology, good food and some beer which was on the house. The food does make up for the occasional poor service, but yeah... After I spoke with the host and explained to him that I was not angry, but he did need to ensure that people are seated correctly...  Sad thing is, this isn't the first time I've heard of this happening. If it occurs again, I'll be lowering my rating a lot and heading off to Goyemon more.  As a side note, NEVER EVER get the Devil Roll. The special sauce = enough mayonnaise that it looks like the sushi roll was participating in a bukkake film.",

On my most recent visit, however, the service wasn't the same.  The place wasn't terribly busy, but for some reason, our sushi orders weren't coming out as quickly as they had during previous visits.  The food is great, though.  It's a fairly small place located in a strip mall, so if you happen to show up during the lunch or dinner rush, be patient.  Despite the less than stellar service we received during our most recent visit, you can bet I'll be back for more.  Can't beat the price for an all-you-can-eat sushi bar!",

I understand the place gets crowded big time on weekends but they make so much money and can't afford to invest in better air conditioning? That's ridiculous!

It had been about a year and a half before my last visit a couple of weeks ago since I live in SoCal.  The quality of the sushi was HORRIBLE (not fresh), service was SLOW (The yakitori came after our dessert), and to top it off they overcharged us on the kid's AYCE.  It says HALF price on the menu, but I was charged more than half and when I brought it up, the manager said they've always charged that way.  I've visited multiple times before and this was the first time I had this problem.  Also, if you're not going to honor the stated price on the menu, why even bother putting HALF price??  I read there was an ownership change last year so perhaps this is the problem?  In any case there are plenty other AYCE sushi restaurants in LV and I will not be returning",

Ive never had multiple waitresses walk past me and ignore me for so long. It's insane how blatantly obvious it is that they are ignoring you. There's a 2 hour time limit for all you can eat (which I never would think to ever wanna be somewhere that long) and it seems like they want that time to run out so bad!   I've been here twice now and I'm pretty sure this is my last time. Food is good but there's nothing here significantly better than your average all you can eat sushi spot.",

We were seated quickly and the staff were very attentive throughout the meal. Everyone in our party of five had the AYCE and the finished plates were always bussed quickly, and the new orders came out promptly. The only downside is that the plates didn't all come out at the same time, but I really didn't mind that.  I can't remember everything we ate, but it included some regular sushi, some dumplings, some ribs, and about half of their specialty rolls. You can order a half roll so you can sample more items.   I didn't think any of the rolls were spicy, but everyone else said the spicy tuna was too spicy. I ended up eating all of it since I thought it tasted great. I wonder why someone would order spicy tuna if they didn't like spicy food. There are many other options to order.  Some of the rolls we had included the 007 roll, the philly roll, the mad dragon roll, the sun of the beach roll, the Hawaii roll, the Harry Potter roll, the Vegas style roll, the strip tease roll, the one minute man roll, and the crazy roll.  I highly recommend this place. We will definitely be coming back.",

I give five stars to the types of rolls they had at Yama and not necessarily the quality of fish. The fish in Vegas just doesn't compare to Japan! The rolls, however are another story. Yama has all of the basic rolls, but most of their menu is filled with original rolls with dirty names. The waiter brought us out a plate of the Wet Dream to try while we waited for the rolls we ordered; I love when they do that! Also, Wet Dream turned out to be my favorite roll.   The seaweed salad was good, cucumber salad not so much. The deep fried oysters had too much fry and not enough oyster. A couple of the rolls had too much cream cheese for me. Thumbs up to being able to order THREE DESSERTS (2 ice creams, 1 mochi ice cream).   Don't let the less than ideal neighborhood and plain exterior of the restaurant scare you away. The interior and sushi make up for it!   Yama Sushi is my new favorite sushi restaurant!",

I was like a honey badger smashing on sushi! I must've cleaned out half the ocean in one sitting. GF stared at me in complete disbelief as I voraciously devoured roll after roll. Here's what you need to know:  Oh My Yama - 10/10  Palm Job - 10/10 No Name - 9.5/10 Oh Damn!! Harry!! - 8/10 TNT - 8/10 Shrimp Tempura 8/10 Seafood Salad - 7.5/10  Pro tip 1: Remember that you're allowed to order half rolls during all-you-can-eat, for more variety.  Pro tip 2: Order the Palm Job, which is not listed with the rest of the sushi. It's frickin bomb.  Pro tip 3: items with a heart next to it on the menu are limited to one order PER PERSON, so if you're with a party, you can order as many as there are people at your table  Summary: If you're looking for exceptional value paired with delicious sushi, this is where it's at. 5 stars!!",

    "text": "As sushi places go, this place is ok. Not fantastic, but definitely better than some places I've been to. However, since their prices are comparable to other better sushi restaurants that are nearby, I would have expected a better experience if I were going to give a higher review.    The sushi recipes were similar to most of the rolls I've had elsewhere. Nothing I had stuck out as particularly good. What did stand out were the mistakes the waiting staff and sushi chef made, the wait after asking for the check (which was not split as had been requested at the very beginning), and the tin foil I found in my baked sushi.   The reasons I am not giving a lower review after these errors are because the food was still decent, the staff were all pleasant, and one of the chefs overheard me talking to the waiter and saying I'm allergic to onions and did not put onions in a roll I requested even though I forgot to request no onions in it (I guess this proaction would have been a bad thing if I'd been ordering for someone else in my group)   I'm not making plans to return here, but if someone else loves it here and offers to treat, I won't refuse to eat here again",

While the rolls are very creative the poor quality in fish ruins the taste  I have been to many AYCE sushi places but have never been this disappointed in the sushi quality.

My personal favorite is the \"Sun of the Beach\" or anything with spicy mayo really. Their rolls are delicious and the decor here offers a nice calm vibe when you come in.   Today's visit was probably the best as our chef was a cool funny guy. Servers always provide good service and the chefs are attentive to whoever is sitting at the bar.   However, this place can feel crowded as it's usually pretty busy and the restaurant is relatively small (even after they expanded the restaurant). It would also be nice if they had stamp cards here, but hey, only one can dream!  Overall, a nice place to get sushi, but just be aware that this place can feel crowded due to the lack of space. Also I wish they had stamp cards here.",

    "text": "Amazing deal for AYCE sushi!  Go for the rolls and your favorite sushi.  I skipped the much recommended sashimi salad, because I felt it would fill me up before the I could sample the rolls and I'm pretty sure I made the right choice (I don't eat as much as I used to).  The sushi tastes pretty fresh, and I they didn't skimp on the fish like they would at buffet places.  The sushi and the rolls are pretty much as you would get at any mid-range sushi restaurant in LA.  But seriously, you're not here about the quality of the food, you're here to stuff yourself silly with sushi, one of the best things in the world to eat.    The good thing is you can order half rolls, so you can sample more.  I really liked that they have detailed descriptions on the menu, so you know the difference and what goes into them.  I don't particularly care for the cooked rolls, so if you're a little tepid about raw fish, you should be ok. It's hard to remember the rolls I have, as it seems to all wash together pretty well, but overall the quality was excellent and I would go back.  They have several AYCE sushi places to choose from in Vegas, and so far both places I've gone to exceeded my expectations.  The thing about this place I remember is they have the salmon caviar sushi - ikura- which is worth ordering if you like it.  I don't think the other place I went to in Chinatown had it.    Also service was really nice and quick, they had people constantly coming in just pigging out and indulging themselves, I'm sure the waitresses here are exhausted.  I'd recommend eating at the bar, as you can order directly to the chefs so it's a quicker service.",

It's always super packed and there is not even close to being enough space to actually enjoy your meal without being constantly bumped into. Claustrophobics beware!  The sushi is good enough, but most of their rolls are drowning in cream cheese, and while I am a fan of the cheese that is creamed it can seriously get to be too much at this place.  The only other thing I have to say that was a major factor in the three star rating was the customer service. Every one working there looked like they hated working there, they hated the people they worked with, and they hated their lives in general.   Probably will stick to Daisho Sushi since its close to our home and everyone there at least pretends to be happy.",

I am not a big fan of sushi if it isn't all you can eat since I am a huge eater.  Yama offers all you can eat for between $22 and $25, depending on the time of day.  I prefer to come here with a large group since they have so many delicious rolls.  This allows you to pick one or two pieces off each roll and indulge in dozens of assortments of sushi.    Favorite Rolls at Yama: Wet Dream, you the man 2, yama crunch, spider roll, snow in vegas, kai roll, and unagi.    You have the option at the end of your meal for mochi or ice cream.  Both are delicious.    Warning:  If you are claustrophobic, do not go to yama.  This has to be the most tightly packed restaurant ever.  It always has a wait, so expect during busy time to arrive about 30-60 minutes before you are waiting to sit down.  Food preparation time is fairly quick, considering how busy it is.",

My coworkers and I love to go after a long day at work and stuff our faces until we look like we are 9 months pregnant with twins. Plus, it's all you can eat!   The sashimi is excellent. Big, fresh pieces of fish, not the small pieces you get at other places. The white tuna and the garlic tuna are my favorite. The white tuna literally melts in your mouth. I could eat only that and be satisfied. It's like butter baby!   Now the rolls, where I even start they are all amazing, and I've tried almost all of them. My favorite is the Be Mine roll. It's lightly fried with a crab meat/cream cheese mixture in the middle, and it has a sweet taste to it. Very tasty. Some of my other favorites are Happy Ending, Baby One More Time, Sun Of The Beach, and No Name just to name a few.   The only down fall to this place (but I still wouldn't take a star off for it) is it is alway busy. It doesn't matter what time of day, it's busy. They did just expand the restaurant, but it's still packed. So prepare to have to wait, but I promise it's worth it!   Don't forget the mochi, mango is my favorite.",

We went ahead and waited it out and it was worth it for sure. It cost $20.95 person. Service was excellent as food came around fast and drinks were refilled. I ordered the seafood salad (as when you do the AYCE deal, you can have 1 salad per person). We were ordering all sorts of shrimp sushi rolls. The mussels were amazing as we shared 3 orders of that. We also got 2 orders of sesame chicken. I ordered some eel rolls that were also tasty. Great experience overall.  The reason I gave it four stars is because the place is very small and there was a wait to get in. We also tried to make a reservation here and they only do first come first serve. Other than that, I recommend this place to anyone that wants AYCE and doesn't mind the wait.",

All the combinations and sauciness....so so so good!   If you are going to try this place out, you should know that it is a small place and it is pretty much always packed, so you will have to be prepared to wait awhile depending on your party size.

But they didn't remember the name of the restaurant or where it was located. However, they WOULD remember the names of the rolls, especially the 'Man Whore.' Good thing for search and yelp :D  The price of the ayce sushi already got meee and we DEFINITELY ate more than $23 worth of seafood. The waiters and waitresses are very friendly and accommodating. And with a group of 4, we really ordered ALOT OF FOOD and never once got a mean glare of 'OMG stop eating so much aaaaah'. I loved the ordering with the paper because you can see the complete list of different appetizers, sides, desserts, and main dishes and just order them so easily by writing in numbers. They also had shrimp heads and uni. I didn't try the uni, although I regret it now, because I thought maybe I really don't like uni, but realized maybe my first time eating uni wasn't the best... The orders came out quickly and seemed to be in succession of how we ordered it. And everything was delicious and well-presented.   To be honest, it seemed like the price and food was too good to be True so I was half expecting to have a stomach ache on the drive back home. But happily and luckily to say I was extremely fat and content in the car =)  Must go back to Yama sushi! oohhh and I didn't know last time that you can order half rolls, will do that next time! :))",

The manager said oh this  is like Nobu quality. Ya, I actually think when Nobu throws there 3 day old fish in the trash that Yama goes dumpster diving for it . That Is The Only Way They Can Charge $20 for all you can eat.  As I'm writing this I am sitting here in the restaurant  and I feel like I have to vomit. Excuse me while I throw up..",

They do not take reservations  Our server took a while to get to us but a bus boy was quick to jolt down our orders & pass them on to our server.

Since I had a car, we decided to venture off strip to find some good eats. The group decided on Yama Sushi.   We showed up around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night. There was a line out the door and a 1 hour wait. By the time we sat down, I was already gnawing on my arm. I was ready to pig out. I looked around for the buffet station and saw none. It turns out, you have to order the items individually. Son-of-B... I thought the food was going to take another 30 minutes to prepare, so I was apologizing to my hungry friends. However, within 2 minutes of ordering, our food already started to come out. We must of tried at least 16 rolls, 8 types of sushi, 10 different appetizers and all of the mochi ice cream. I actually don't remember what I ate, since there was just a blur of hands going from the table to my mouth. Everything that we had was delicious, with the expectation of the edamame and yakitori (chicken skewers).   The place is really cramped, crowded, and dimly lit. It's also not that expensive.   A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italia n Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",

This seems a silly thing to get worked up about, but the table was crammed up against a \"private\" party room with windows. My chair stuck halfway out into the entrance of the party room, so when a party of 15 came, I had more ass in my face than if I'd been at a strip club. Each time someone entered or left I had to move my chair for them.  Honestly, though, I just about screamed when a man's rather large ass bumped into my face as he tried to move around people. Seriously, how can you enjoy sushi with a faceful of buttocks?  I wouldn't mind going again sometime if I'm in the area, but I'll just sit and wait thank you very much, until a better table opens.",

The sushi was pretty fresh and tasty but you can't place orders with just any waitress, you have to place orders with the waitress assigned to your table. The service to me should be better must be better especially in a town that depends on the tourism industry.   I don't know if it's purposely like this or just by coincidence but the employees who work there are mostly Asian and Mexican but there are no Mexican waiters/waitresses, they are the cooks, the water re-filler persons and the cooks, while the Asian people are the waiters/waitresses and front of house cooks. I'm not saying the owners of Yama Sushi did this on purpose but that's how the employee staff breaks down.   This was my first time and sadly probably the last time.",

It's only a couple of minutes off the strip and for $21/person for lunch, the price can't be beat for AYCE anywhere near the Vegas strip.    My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and ate more than our fair share of $21 worth of sushi, rolls, and appetizers.  The items we ate that I just LOVED included: Sweet Shrimp (By far my FAVORITE place I've had sweet shrimp.  Perfect clear sweet after taste and the batter used to fry the head was not overwhelming and complimented the delicacy of the shrimp brains) Garlic tuna Halibut Tuna Salmon Baked mussels (one order contains 4 very small mussels) Soft-shelled crab  They were very busy with a line out the door.  So expect average/sub par service.  Our waitress forgot a couple of items we ordered, but it didn't bother us.  It just left us more room for delicious sushi that came from the sushi chef since we sat at the sushi bar.   I can't wait to go to Vegas again just so I can come here to eat again.",

He kept wiping his nose with the back of his hand and digging the same hand in the rice to make the sushi. THAT WASN'T EVEN THE WORST PART! What killed it, was when he disappeared under the bar with one finger holding one nostrel, then he came back up and kept making sushi. My husband and I wonder if he sneezed, or shot snot out of his nose. In any event HE DID NOT WASH HIS HANDS. To top it all off, we talked to the manager, he said he would talk to him while he was ringing us up. We were charged for all you can eat and only ate a roll a piece. Poor sanitation and worse Customer Service. Do yourself a favor and go to China Town!",

Every roll I had was made right in front of me, which I had never experienced before.   I had maybe 5 different rolls before I called it a night, and every single roll was great! I have a very weak stomach, so I only had one spicy roll. Definitely would go again. Either alone, or with a group, you're in for a great experience.",

Cha ching!  The quality and selection here were excellent. Right up there with the best Vegas AYCE spots. AYCE items include appetizers and desserts also. It was about $21 for lunch which was great.   Sushi itself was fresh, rice was made perfectly.  However I give them only 4 stars because my favorite 2 spots in Vegas still reign on my list. I felt service was a bit rushed because of how crowded they were. Hikari and Sushi House Goyemon still are my tops.",

A lot of the rolls seemed kind of dry or had bad quality?... I'm not sure, but it was off.  Some highlights: Wet Dream, One Minute Man, Yellowtail, Halibut, and Green Mussel  AMBIANCE:  The restaurant kind of had a weird layout where there were two rooms. It also felt a little cramped.   SERVICE: Servers were very nice and attentive but they kept messing up our order. They would give us plates we DIDN'T order and would forget about plates we DID order. I also don't like that they don't give you the paper to mark your order.. you have to tell them what you want every time.   TIPS: Definitely do the AYCE so you can try a variety of dishes.",

I have never liked how they cram every last seat they can into the place to the point of causing discomfort to their guests. I am not sure what they think those little shoji screens do but they might as well remove them. You feel as if you are dining with the people at the next table. It is awkward and uncomfortable.  I had put up with this because the sushi was absolutely amazing but unfortunately it is no longer as fresh as it once was. The rolls now seem like a small step up from supermarket sushi. Either the chefs don't care as much, the quality of the ingredients has been downgraded, or probably a combination of both.",

Besides sushi, there are also other appetizers (soft shell crab, chicken, edamame, tofu, etc) that you can order. So you can come with everyone and anyone that wants to eat because you can pretty much satisfy everyone. From people that like sashimi, to rolls, or people that don't like sushi at all they have options here too.   There are a couple items that are limit one per person and of course, those are the \"premium\" items. Uni, yellowtail collar, sashimi salad, sweet shrimp, etc. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yama-sushi-las-vegas?select=3jWsRK-2pIRA9Ze-7JRHDg#dJWIm7XvF6VCJez6GhH80g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yama...</a>   So heres some tip... - Don't get greedy with the sashimi salad <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yama-sushi-las-vegas?select=3jWsRK-2pIRA9Ze-7JRHDg#3jWsRK-2pIRA9Ze-7JRHDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yama...</a> . Even though its one per person, on order is good for 2/3 people. We made the mistake of ordering 1 per person and that pretty much filled me up 1/3.  - They really are anal about rice thats not eaten. So be warned! my friend had like 2 balls of rice on his plate and the lady made it a point to tell us that if he doesn't finish it then we will get charged.  - Call before you come so you can see if theres a wait. When we went around 1, there were no wait but by the time we left there was a line forming. I'm guessing that this place gets packed at night.   Overall, this is pretty good AYCE Sushi and I will definitely recommend it. Everyone needs  a break from the vegas buffets.",

I was reading that some people had a problem with the service - I don't know if they were reading your comment or what but I couldn't take a sip of my water and someone was there for a refill.

The sushi chef was extremely fast, making sushi rolls appear in under three minutes like David Copperfield.  The baked and fried rolls took a bit longer-- probably a six minute wait.  We ate a total of five rolls, which would have been $50 if ordered separately, so bring a hearty appetite and try to kill six rolls to get your money's worth.  That's a lot of sushi, I could barely walk after crushing five rolls with my wife.  A word of caution, if you leave any food on your plate they charge you a surcharge, so don't go overboard.      The rolls were extremely fresh and delicious.  A must order were the Striptease and the Wet Dream Rolls.  Our waitress told us that the fish is delivered daily from three different locations.    This place is definitely on the re-visit list next time we are in Vegas.",

We were handed a fork with a plastic fork? I have no idea why. They sat us at the bar because we they were very busy and there was no wait for the bar. The guy making the sushi was more interested in flirting with 3 girls that sat in front of him. I seen him make them something special on a plate with 3 pieces and they looked at him and he said try it. We sat there and did not know what we were suppose to do or who do we order from because he was really busy, and the girls are always so fast when they go by it is hard to stop anyone to ask what we were to do. This is the last time we would sit at the bar. We will for sure wait for a table next time.  We still love this place and it is still our favorite you can not take away the good Sushi they have especially that Spicy Fish Salad it is to die for!!!",

    "text": "Majide!!!   Look, this place is an AYCE sushi joint not some three Michelin star winning sushi restaurant like Sukiyabashi Jiro. So if you are looking for top quality sushi, you should know better than to come here. I mean, do you go into McDonald's expecting USDA prime beef? I should rephrase that to do you expect real beef at McDonald's ...   I mean it baffles my mind that people expect 5-star sushi at an AYCE where lunch (11 to 3) is $20.95 and dinner (3 to 11) is $23.95! Then again, there are insensible morons all around us like the crazies that I saw the other day buying sushi from 7-Eleven. Oh the horror!  Let's put it this way, compared to the prices of buffets on The Strip, Yama Sushi's price is a steal. Moreover, have you even seen the deplorable sushi on The Strip? Either way, I came here expecting quantity over quality, but was surprised that the quality wasn't too shabby.   The wife and I ate at Yama Sushi because we were in town with a bunch of Los Angeles Yelpers as part of an unofficial summer break weekend for July 4th. You see, the wife and I don't usually eat AYCE and Yama Sushi was not even on our radar, but since the group decided to check it out we decided to join them as not to be party foul.   So yea, although I still needed to tackle down some of the Vegas restaurants reviewed by my Yelp friend and Vegas aficionado Rod U. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details_lists?userid=oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ\">yelp.com/user_details_li...</a>) who has several awesome Vegas restaurant lists, we took the detour with Yama Sushi that ended up being better than expected.  Despite our large party (20+), Yama Sushi accommodated us by putting together 4-5 tables. Since I am an aisle-person (planes, concerts, sporting events), the wife and I sat at an end table. Our end table of six was the sober table because we had come to eat and not to get drunk and rowdy. I mean pro eaters know that AYCE places recuperate their money via overpriced alcohol, DUH!  Anyways, we must have ordered a million rolls. I can't even remember what we had because the food just kept on \"rollin\". There were rolls with cream cheese, rolls with eel sauce, and rolls with gooey mayo goodness. But with AYCE, everything all starts tasting the same after awhile. Good thing Ed A. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zyFN0KU7Y9MfTZIROrsKhA\">yelp.com/user_details?us...</a>) was at our table to clear the leftover roll pieces our gluttonous asses could not finish... so that we could order more of course.   Coming in with low expectations, I was surprised that the food wasn't too bad. The rolls were decent and the appetizers such as the soft shell crab and sweet shrimp were tasty. I really do not know how this business model works because pretty much their entire menu is available for AYCE (some items such as the uni had a limit of one order).  The only real awkward moment of the night was that there seemed to be some disagreement with the drunk table at our party about whether they had ordered 3 or 4 small bottles of sake (375 ML). While I was not paying attention to their count, either they are real lightweights with sake or the restaurant overcharged a bottle. At the end of the day, they ended up only paying for 3. Aside from that moment, I was impressed by how good a job Yama did of servicing our large crowd.  So is Yama Sushi 5-star quality? Come on now. However, for the price, it is as good a value that you will find in a town (Las Vegas aka Lost Wages) hell-bent on stealing all your wages.    * BTW AYCE sushi places get you full with the rice in the rolls. ** The only sashimi-type dish for AYCE they have is the sashimi salad.",

    "text": "Warning: Do not come to this restaurant if you eat sushi often!  I don't consider myself an expert on sushi, but I've eaten at a lot of good sushi places around the Socal area. My favorite places are Sushi Ota in San Diego and Ootoro in Walnut. I also like places like Akasaka in Rowland Heights and I even enjoy the cheaper sushi joints like any of the revolving Kula bars and also Sushi Q in Chino Hills. With that being said, this is absolutely the worst sushi restaurant I've ever had the misfortune of trying.  We tried pretty much everything. The salmon, the tuna, the yellowtail, the sweet shrimp, the uni, the cooked fish, the hand rolls, the specialty rolls, you name it. There was not one piece of fish that was appetizing. When eating sashimi, you want it to be fresh and you want the pieces that melt in your mouth. Well, the sashimi here was the opposite. It was so dry, I felt like I was swallowing paper at times. I'm not even joking here, even prepackaged sushi at Japanese marts are significantly better than the stuff served at this sorry excuse for a sushi joint.  Honestly, the best thing I had here was the miso soup. I shit you not, even the edamame was disappointing. The edamame..  To say the least, this meal was the worst meal I've had in a very long time. If you're not from around Vegas, don't waste a precious meal coming here. Your stomach will thank me.",

You almost can't go wrong ordering any of their Special Rolls..Happy Ending, Wet Dream, Snow in Vegas and One Night at Yama rolls are all very good. My two favorite rolls are SUN OF THE BEACH and DANCING IN THE SHEET. And they serve the best mochi ice cream in town. Yama served me the best meal I've eaten in Vegas, going on 6 years now they have not been beat. And the lively crowd makes this place a lot of fun too. It gets packed here, so go on a weekday or get in line. Service is very fast and friendly as well.  Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "I am sorry...  /Commences Rant  I will never return here. I was sorely disappointed and feel like I was treated as a subpar customer. Yeah not everyone eats sushi. I am that guy. Consequently I did join a large group of friends here. I knew that things wouldn't exactly be outstanding, but this place took it to a whole new level. The only reason they get a two star vs a one star is that most of my friends received excellent service and food.   Whereas I got worse treatment than the red headed step child... Hell that is demeaning I don't even have red hair  *SMH*. In fact my trip here was one of my worst restaurant experiences in the last 10-15 years. *extremely disappointed*  So while all my friends purchased the AYCE meal and started to receive their various foods within 5 minutes of ordering, my appetizers (sesame chicken and shrimp tempura) took about 45 minutes to receive the first item, the shrimp tempura. It took another 10 plus minutes to receive the sesame chicken.  REALLY YAMA SUSHI!!! You brought out appetizers to my friends on the AYCE menu within 20 minutes. Why cant you bring the non AYCE appetizers to the guy who has nothing else to eat?  But your attitude seemed to be who cares he isn't getting AYCE.  Knowing that they are concentrating on the AYCE folks and the rolls that most of the people are getting, I knew I would have my food delayed. What ended up happening? Everyone was on their third or fourth roll at least before my food was served.   Consequently I think you guys can go jump off a cliff. Way to treat a customer who wanted to partake in what he had heard was an awesome restaurant experience. I can count the number of times on a single hand where I have had a worse dining experience in my entire life!  Way to ruin what was otherwise a wonderful day for me with a large number of friends. I SERIOUSLY HOPE YOU DECIDE TO REVAMP YOUR POLICY TOWARDS NON AYCE PAYING CUSTOMERS OR THOSE WHO WANT SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND YET STILL ORDER DIRECTLY OFF OF YOUR MENU WITHOUT A SINGLE CHANGE REQUEST!  WHY THE HELL EVEN HAVE THOSE CHOICES LISTED WITH PRICING THAT IS NOT AYCE IF YOU JUST WANT TO IGNORE THE GUY WHO ORDERS DINNER THAT WAY.  I HOPE BEYOND A SHADOW OF A BELIEF THAT CUSTOMERS TURN AWAY FROM YOUR RESTAURANT IF THEY ARE LIKE ME. SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE TREATED FAIRLY AND NOT MADE TO WAIT AN OVERLY EXTENSIVE PERIOD OF TIME TO GET WHAT YOU ARE ALREADY SERVING TO THOSE ALL AROUND HIM.  I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AND I HOPE THAT OTHERS WILL NOT AS WELL.  To add insult to injury your staff came after me for leaving less than the pre-ordained tip as listed on the check since I was part of a party of 6 or more. You should have been happy I left a tip at all. But to have you come after me demanding more for absolutely no service and unreasonable treatment, well F YOU. I am still pissed off about it and it has been several weeks.    I hope your business goes bust!  /Ends Rant  I am Schel and I approve this review!  Edit: Screw it I cant stand to give them 2 stars... I have to drop it to a 1 star... still super ticked off...",

We walked in and it was busy, which I thought was a good sign because then it must be good right? Nope I couldn't be more wrong. We were seated promptly and our order was taken quickly and that's pretty much all that was good.   Can I please have a pot of rice with my thin pieces of nigiri? That's exactly what it was. A big ball of rice under a thin piece of fish. The fish was good, but the rice was too much. As for the sushi rolls themselves, pretty much all rice as well. The menu didn't give a good description of the rolls, so 2 of the rolls we ended up ordering were fried, which we wanted to stay away from. The variety of things that came in the sushi rolls were pretty meh, just crab, shrimp or salmon. Nothing that jumped out or made me say \"omg I have to get that!\" Lastly, I freaking love soft shel crab. I ordered it and was completely disappointed that all I could taste was the tempura batter.   There are sooo many other sushi places in Vegas and unfortunately to say that this place is not one of ones I will be back to.",

Back then it was pretty small (not that it is large now, but in the past year (or year and a half), it looks like they expanded to the space next door so that they have more dining area (and they also have a sushi bar on the other side too).  My favorite dish here - well it is hard to choose just one, so I won't.  I will say that every time I go here, I must get the Seafood Salad.  It is absolutely wonderful!  the sushi tastes great, and that sauce; nice and spicy just they way I like it.  Second on the must get list is ,the hamachi kama; the last time we were there, they had run out of it (gasp!), so we got the Salmon kama instead.  Now I'm not sure which I like more (thankfully since it is all I can eat, I don't have to choose).    Roll wise - they have an abundance of rolls, all with, I will say \"interesting\" names.  One of my favorites is the Fire Cracker roll - whats not to love about jalapeno's and tuna?  For the most part we go heavy on the sushi, not so heavy on the rolls since they fill us up faster, but there are some rolls that are definitely worth tasting.    A great place at what I think is a reasonable price.  I'm ready to go back again!",

We initially sat at the bar since we didn't have time to wait for a table.  But as soon as a table opened up, she asked if we still want a table and we quickly said yes.  Pros:  The Super white tuna, big clam, salmon, and hamachi kama were awesome.  AYCE is a bit cheaper than Goyemon  Cons: Scallop wasn't fresh, mackerel wasn't as good, and 2 order limit on the mochi icecream.

At AYCE sushi at less than $25, it's a freaking steal. And AYCE means ALLLLL YCE....... the entire menu, no time limit, no charges for leftover food (but they won't bring new food unless you finish it).  My advice: - Order half rolls so you can try more - Share everything! - Seafood salad.... all sashimi with no rice. Best bang for your buck! - Wear loose-fitting clothes, because you are about to get down on some serious fatassery - Don't come here if you plan to wear a ho dress to a club immediately afterward.  I wish I could remember all I tried, but we tried just about everything, including ice cream. They also serve sake and beer, which my side of the table indulged in (and quickly because those loud, boisterous people, which no one seemed to mind).   I wish I could give them more stars..... but the service wasn't the friendliest. A friend of mine who doesn't eat seafood was completely ignored, and his dish wasn't brought out until we were almost done. We also noticed that we were charged for 4 bottles of sake, when we only ordered 3. We told our waitress, and a few minutes later, 4 waitresses filed out together, stood in a line to confront us, and angrily insisted that we ordered 4. It was pretty unecessary and in poor taste. We eventually resolved it and paid for the 3. That left a bad taste in my mouth, but the sushi and the copious amounts of booze left an amazing taste. 3 stars.",

On top of that they still took ages to give us our food.  Being an avid sushi eater, I think the fish wasn't even fresh, I guess the plus was not getting diarrhea after it's all said and done. They over load the rice on their thin pre sliced fish to get you full fast. This place gets way too crowded for crummy food and negligent service. I'd advise to check out another place.",

Grilled to perfection and not fishy smelling at all. The white tuna, garlic tuna is to die for. Seriously, such a great deal for so many variety of fishes and side dishes!   If you are out here in Vegas, come check out this steal!",

    "text": "The last time I have been here was basically in months/years.   Ambiance: 2 - Yama is just way too small these days on the inside; especially the waiting area. I came early yesterday to eat, but when I left, there were about 50 people were waiting outside. It's crazy how long people will wait just to save a few dollars! There is just NO space to move inside there.   Service: 3 - The service has gone down since when I first ate there. Our server was really nice, but we had to repeatedly re-ask for our orders and everything took a super long time to come out. And they tried to rush us out of there. Not very nice. I understand you have a lot of people waiting, but don't be rude!   Food: 2 - I'm really into nigiri, and theirs is just okay--I'm not sure what it is, might just be the quality of the fish, sometimes it won't taste super fresh like it used to. Though, my favorite nigiri is garlic tuna. I also suggest the Seafood Salad w/ spicy sauce and Hamachi Kama.   Overall, there's just not enough quality dishes anymore to revisit. This place has really gone down, and it's sad. But there's just a lot of competition and places that are way better.",

    "text": "Read through many of the reviews and this is a summary:  Asians who know authentic sushi gave this place one or two stars, based mostly off of the quality of the fish. Also, Asians want the most bang for their buck. In LA or Orange County, one can find a fresh sushi place for $25/person (Sushi Asahi in Riverside & Sake 2 Me in Tustin, I'm looking at you).   People who do NOT know what real sushi is, namely, white people, gave this place four to five stars. They don't eat sushi for the quality of the fish and probably think they are getting a great deal. Which they probably are seeing that they are in Vegas where people expect to dish out $40-$80 for a buffet.   I, being an Asian person who somewhat knows a little bit about sushi (or at least pretends to know), gave this place one star for the not-very-fresh sushi BUT also gave them an extra star because the rolls were pretty delicious. I ordered the Ellen roll which is imitation crab with shrimp tempura and rice wrapped with soy paper and topped with raw salmon and some spicy sauce. And it looked way to saucy but the flavor... It was really something else. Though I wouldn't recommend it for people who can't take the heat.   Anyway, definitely try this place and you're not picky about what kind of fish you are eating. And if you liked to eat the cooked kind of fish! (ew)",

Since the very first time we came, he's been telling me that this was the best sushi restaurant ever. I've been skeptical because sushi is not exactly my fave. However! This place is so. freaking. good. Worth the wait! We did the All You Can Eat and you better believe I stuffed my face. For only $24?? It's a steal! Tried at least 5 rolls including the happy rainbow, baby one more time, oh dam!! harry, kiss the ass, and the no name. All delicious. My favorites were the Hawaii and the Oh Dam!! Harry, but DANG they are SPICY! Took a helping of mochi to cool my mouth down! Also not to be missed - the seafood salad and miso soup. Both top notch. The only complaint I have is that my stomach isn't bigger and I had to stop eating before I exploded. Omg. I am so happy right now.",

Try the seafood salad, and you cannot go wrong with any of their specialty rolls.  I absolutely love this place, even though its pretty small.  Worth absolutely trying nonetheless.  Bringing someone who never tried sushi? Take them here and make them try any of the specialty rolls.  Personally I like the wet dream, man whore (yes thats the actual name), no name roll, double dragon, one minute man. (these would be great for novice sushi eaters to try! believe me I was one of them!!)  However, there is this one waitress I dislike, she needs to smile more and needs to be more alive. She doesn't constitute my definition of \"welcoming\" and she was a bit rude one of the other times I went here.  Overall, great place so try it.",

While I don't thinks it's the best, you definitely get a good bang for your buck.   The nice thing is they accommodate large groups very well. Call ahead and they will likely set up the side room for you. I also have to commend them for their ability to serve large groups so quickly. It's always awkward when you get your roll but half of the table hasn't gotten anything to eat. This is rarely the case here.   The menu options go on forever. Almost anything or any combination you can think of is an option. The sushi is pretty good (my favorite is the smoked salmon) and many of the rolls and other dishes are descent, but nothing really catches my attention. I feel like many of the dishes are too bland and quickly thrown together.   A good place for AYCE sushi, but not the best.",

You have to finish all your food or they charge you extra.  The downside is what to do when the fish taste like crap. Can I renegotiate the price? Another thing I don't understand is why some of the sushi were already presoaked in soy sauce. May be it's the chef's style. I'm from out of town and I've had better quality of fish.

They had 3 pieces left when the waitress stopped by to check on them.  They asked her if they have to eat the last 3 pieces and the waitress immediately said yes. The look on their faces was comical. I admit I can eat spicy food but their spicy rolls are really spicy. Overall the food is good and fresh. The service is fast and efficient.",

Often I've seen AYCE where they make you wait and try to load you up on soups & appetizers.  While you can certainly get those, their many sushi chefs whip out some amazing creations super fast.  You can get basic Nigiri, which was fine.  Actually, the salmon was quite good.  And, they have an amazing selection of rolls too.  But, my favorite was the \"seafood salad\" which is huge plate of various Sashimi (no rice) with a ponzu-like sauce.  OMG!  Wished we lived closer!",

Just amazing sushi and the names for the rolls are probably the funniest and most original you will ever read. They have quite a few tvs so you can watch the game and eat while on a date. The pricing is about the average every where else like vegas but the quality of the food blows most places out of the water. Definite top 3 sushi place I have been to.",

Yes that means, appetizers! unlimited miso soup!!!! all the sushi, desserts, everything!  20$ lunch, 24$ dinner. NOT BAD AT ALL.   Considering all the sushi are fresh, aka made to order, it's awesome. Service was so-so. Place is a bit cramped. But as long as the food is good, I am with it!",

    "text": "This place... *sigh* I usually go to goyemon and I wanted a change so I came to Yama. I saw all the good reviews here so I was like why not. The wait time wasn't bad like 10minutes? We got seated and the server got our orders. The shrimp tempura was good and the baked mussels. Seafood salad was good. Everything was all good until  those three came out. Just FYI I usually order sushi not rolls because rolls just fills you up and I order alottt at once because I don't like food pauses. I don't like it when there is a pause for my sushi to come out because you can slowly feel full. This is where everything went wrong. The fish was not fresh and the amount of rice they put with the raw fish is freakin ridiculous. You can't even taste the fish because there's so much rice. After 4 or 5 sushi, there was a 10minute pause. And also the server got mixed up with our order so she gave it to the table next next to us...FAIL. we ordered half a roll which was the no name and that was actually good.   So in my opinion, I think this place is popular for their rolls not the fish. If you like rolls then it'll prolly be a hit for you, but it was def. a miss for a fish lover like me.  Oh and also, we ordered dessert and the dessert came out twice became the servers got mixed up again.. The ending didn't even end up nicely... I am def sticking with my goyemon and sushimon nxt time",

We had four different waiters try to break down our bill and it took almost 20 min. To get out of the door after eating. All in all st the end of the night the food we ate didnt taste so good anymore because of the poor service.

    "text": "So if you're in Vegas and you're looking for an AYCE sushi place, this is it! I can't vouch or compare it to other places, but it definitely is one of the best buffets in the area if you're down for sushi. It's a little ways off the strip on Flamingo, in a little shopping center near the Chase bank, so also conveniently located so you can refill with pocket change to test your luck some more.  This place is very casual. Just stroll in with PJ and you'll be fine, but the food definitely says otherwise. If you're looking for service that's more attentive, I would try coming during the weekdays, as opposed to the weekend. The 2 hour limit goes by pretty quick, and a lot of time can be wasted while waiting if you don't order a whole lot at one time. But just be sure to not go overboard on your second or third round of ordering because they do charge for wasted or leftover food (which is how it should be).  Sit at the bar if it's just yourself or the 2 of you, but get a table if there are more in your party and everyone is doing AYCE. There are items on the menu that have hearts on them, and those are the ones that you can only place one order per person. Those items are picked that way, because IMO they are truly the better and pricier items on the menu (amebi, uni, sashimi salads, soft shell crabs, etc). The dishes are all made to order and everything we order was fresh and sooo tasty! The grilled tuna collars and salmon collars are my favorite because they cook it so well. They have just the right amount of char to them, and the meat around the collar bones were cooked and super moist! The amebi was fresh and tasty, however if I were to go there again, I would request they cook the head a tad bit longer so it's extra crispy! The uni is hit or miss. Last time we went, our friends got the uni and it wasn't great, but by the time we ordered ours, it was magnificent. If you get the seafood salad, I would skip the creamy dressing because it was just too heavy on the mayo. Otherwise, nigiri was on point. Can't really comment too much on the other appetizers, but in all, everyone had a great time and everyone really enjoyed the food. It's probably one of the few places in Vegas where you feel like a winner after leaving!  Oh, if you're driving here during dinner rush, parking is pretty limited. I remember one of the two times we've been here, it was like a line of cars waiting for people to leave (it reminded me undergrad in the parking lots at the beginning of each semester). If you're staying near the strip, I would just take a cab or uber it. It's like 7-10 minutes east of Bally hotel.",

My husband would be on the cusp of telling him his order and the dude would turn around and make mine.  Poor husband.  But other than that, the food came quickly and it was all really, really good.  The seafood salad (spicy, of course) was my favorite thing.  Prices were totally reasonable--similar to other AYCE joints, maybe even a couple dollars cheaper.   I think it was $23.95 for dinner.  Service was somewhat slow, but only because they were packed to the gills with customers.  Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be returning!",

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience restaurant was clean and tidy and staff look to be clean and tidy as well. I would happily recommend there all you can eat sushi deal unless you only plan on getting one roll or so. The one flaw that I have for this restaurant would be the Yakitori well good Yakitori is usually a very nice compliment to good sushi the Yakitori at Yama is regrettably subpar. I would advise just going straight for the sushi and ignore the appetizer section all together. That being said despite that as I've already stated the sushi is excellent fresh well-prepared band delicious the portions are adequately sized for the price and I do indeed plan to make trips back here when I am able",

    "text": "Before a business meeting at a local bar, my best friend and I decided to have a lunch date at a new sushi joint to help nurse our hangovers.  I did a little research on my Yelp app and came across this place.  People seemed to really like the place, so I was curious to check it out as well.    I've been to this strip mall many times.  For Albertson's, for the nail salon (eyebrow wax), for Chase bank.  It's a cool area, full of businesses.  It's located on Flamingo and Maryland Pkwy.  Some close businesses that I frequent:  Buffalo Exchange, The Garage, Seafood City, Target, etc.  It's a great neighborhood.  I enter the location and I'm super surprised to find a large venue.  A very small hostess area, but the place has a couple of rooms attached to the big dining area.  We were taken to the room on the right side of the restaurant.  Super cute!  The focal point is the sushi bar.  There's a background montage of flowers, all lit up.  The recess lighting that shines on the bar and cloth picture panels makes for a very enlightening focus.  I really liked it!  The small two top tables were separated with a little Japanese folding curtain to create a more intimate setting for me and my lunch date.   As in all sushi joints, I always get the AYCE (All You Can Eat) special.  Since we can after 3pm, we had to pay the dinner price of $23.95.  I also have some very strong feelings and practices when it comes to AYCE.  I always stick to the side dishes, appetizers and nigiri so I can get more for my buck.  Here's what I got, grouped based on my preferences:  Things I liked:  Yellowtail nigiri (fresh and less of a fish flavor), Miso soup (perfect for monsoon weather), seaweed salad (lovely taste of the ocean), hamachi kama (collar of the fish, grilled, full of marbleized meat and served with a soy dipping sauce), deep fried mussels (tempura battered and soo good!) and as an exception, the Yama Roll (Tempura shrimp roll with eel, shrimp, avocado layered on top.  Sooo flavorful)  Thinks I didn't like:  Gyoza (it was nicely fried, however the filling was not as good as I've tried.  More filling than meat, it seemed), Chicken Teriyaki skewers (tomatoes, onions and white meat chicken.  Not as good as other sushi joints.  The chicken was a bit dry) and the BBQ Ribs (marbleized and flavorful but I prefer more of a grilled rib.  There were not grill marks and it just seemed a bit rubbery)  The great thing is that it all still great.  I would definitely be back for more servings of the Hamachi Kama.  I don't often find myself in this area, but when I do, I at least know there's a great sushi joint!",

We were pleasantly surprised when we found everything (including appetizers and desserts) were included in the all you can eat.  There are so many choices. So my husband and i decided to start a list (kept on the phone) off all the rolls we got and our personal ratings on them.  We will be going here again, most definitely.",

Any  tables that are open will be used to seat the small parties that come in, so there will never be enough space for you, regardless of how long you wait. The sushi is good, but the service is awful, and they won't even be nice to you about the seating situation.",

But my all time favorite has to be the man whore.  Their hot Sake goes great with the meal along with some hot green tea. Every time I leave they keep me wanting more! I've never had a problem with any of the staff members, they're always very friendly and joke around with you. Service and food here never disappoint me.",

Simply the best! it will definitely exceed your expectations for the price you pay!   it gets busy at about 5pm to 8pm, so if you have a large party  ( i would say 3+) , get there early. The place is small and probably occupies about 50 people in the building at the same time (if that)  this is an AYCE (all-you-can-eat) sushi place $20 for lunch and $24 for dinner. They tell you there's a time limite, but honestly, I have been coming here for years and never had a time limit. You can order anything on the menu with no limits!    What I love about this place? You can order half rolls! Perfect for someone who wants to try new rolls or if you're feeling adventurous for the day and want to try different things! And the rolls are not full of rice to fill you up,. They are perfect small sushi cut pieces.   P.S. Order what you can eat,preferably half rolls for those who likes to try out new things. Don't waste food, there are plenty of others who cannot afford to even buy rice! Just Sayin..",

I was so happy to finally eat something good in Vegas because for the past few days, I was disappointed. Glad I've tried this place and I would definitely be coming back again!  I love the mochi ice cream. I had it twice, and my sushi was so mouth-watering. The rollers were extremely good as well. I love how you can half-order so you can try everything without overstuffing yourself. Damn my stomach hurt though cause I wanted to everything on that menu.  You will be seeing me again, for sure!",

Sushi chefs in the back are chugging corona beer and are sloppy. The place is dirty and if you go there when the sun goes down you risk getting shot or getting approached by a bum.

The staff treats us like VIP because of course how frequent we eat there. But ever since the beginning we've always been treated great! When we first started coming we had to wait 30-50 mins for the sushi bar but now we always get seated right away just because we earned our keep I suppose. But it was always worth the wait in the past!!!  We hardly ever order anything because Paow already knows what we like and even makes us special little creations just for us! It pays off staying loyal to your sushi spot and this place has been amazing! We do however miss Moo and Holly(servers), they moved back to their origins. But we still love the staff! Oh and do the AYCE sushi! I highly recommend the seafood salad! Omnomnom!!!! The Yama roll is great and I love their white tuna, garlic tuna and unagi! Delish!!!!!",

    "text": "Guess what Yelp... I'm Back! I've chosen Yama Sushi to be my first comeback post, mainly because I ate there last night and I realized I never wrote a review for it! There's many different factors that play into the 4 star rating I decided to give Yama.   First off, the service is particularly fast, but does have it's low points. On multiple occasions, I've put in an order and it never comes out. I either have to cancel it, or remind the staff about it before I end up getting my yummy food. If you read my reviews, you'll know that service is a very big part of how I decide my ratings.   Secondly, the two main reasons I come to Yama over other sushi places is because of the smoked salmon nigiri and the wet dream roll. I still remember the first time I tried the smoked salmon nigiri.. It melted perfectly in my mouth. Thinking about it now is making my mouth water. The wet dream also has a similar effect on me. It is a unique combinator of flavors and ingredients that leaves you fighting for the last piece. You don't know how many times I've contemplated ordering my own..  The last thing I want to talk about is the quality of the food. Each time I've come to Yama, I feel like the quality of the food was different each time. On some days it looked like they put more emphasis on the presentation and use of ingredients, while other days left me disappointed. Last night in particular, I wasn't too impressed with any of the food I ordered besides the wet dream.   Yama is a great sushi place in Vegas. If you've never tried any other sushi places in Vegas, be sure to try this one first. While I would come here again, I feel like it's time for me to move on to something new.",

    "text": "Colleagues and acquaintances have urged me to try this place and always mention how great the AYCE deal is.  We had lunch here today and ordered that for the three of us.    The menu has a nice selection and the decor is pretty modern, especially considering the neighborhood.  Our service was great, and they utilized 3 different people for drink refills, bussing, and ordering.  Here's the problem:  I've always wondered how a place with quality fish can turn a profit charging ~$14/roll on speciality rolls, when AYCE costs mid $20's.  The answer: use tons of rice!  Everything was prepared nicely and held together well. The quality seemed to be top notch.  Their spicy special-sauces had good flavor profiles and had a nice kick. However, each piece of sushi had about a penny's girth worth of fish (think half inch), but each piece was normal sized (about a 50 cent piece.). I've eaten in dozens of sushi joints, and I've never had so much rice packed into each bite.  Is this standard on a la carte items or only AYCE?  I don't have the answer.",

However, when a co-worker and I went last week, I was disappointed with the quality of the fish. The spicy tuna was dense and dark, and none of the nigiri I ordered was fresh (red snapper tasted like it was about to turn). I'll stick with the location on Spring Mountain, or perhaps try the new one on the strip.",

Yama Sushi is quire popular, considering it's not too far from the strip, its cheap and its good. My first time here I came for a late lunch. The service was good, exactly what I expected since it was not all that busy. Nothing I had was bad or tasted stale...always a plus. ;-)  The latest visit was for dinner. At roughly around 7 PM, It was packed. People sitting inside, lined up out the door, more folks waiting outside. Then, some more people popping in and out picking up their orders to go...plenty of traffic.   Since I was running solo, I opted to sit at the bar...seemed like the fastest way to get a seat...bingo! That worked out well. I proceeded to order from the chefs behind the bar. I had the pleasure of ordering from Evil Man...YUP! You read that right! That's exactly what his name tag said...he is also some sort of supervisor and spoke Spanish to a few of his coworkers. This guy is good! Fast, efficient and effective! He never missed a beat. There were 7 people sitting around me, he was able to get all of their orders and also made other orders from the tables...bravo!  Never felt like I was being ignored or my food took too long. What a blessing for an AYCE Sushi spot! Needless to say, I'll be back.",

The restaurant itself is fairly large and has a lot of seats, and decor is nothing special. Service was attentive (good about refilling waters, coming by to check on you/ask for more orders), though I wouldn't say friendly, and you aren't assigned an individual server.   If you come here, it's for the food. EVERYTHING on the menu is included in the AYCE, which is amazing! The menu has a ton of appetizers, rolls, and more (even dessert). I opted for hamachi kama (yellowtail cheek) and agedashi tofu for starters, then proceeded to eat several rolls.   I think the names of their special rolls are hilarious, and have never seen a place with so many humorous names. By the way, it's not advertised but you can order half-orders of any of their rolls! Perfect if you want to try many different rolls like I did. The rolls also come out fairly quick, which is good because you have a two-hour time limit.   The sushi itself was decent. Not the best quality ever, but very good and for AYCE this place is a bargain! I highly recommend coming here if you are craving a lot of sushi!",

I did get a plate of teriyaki and white rice for my younger one instead of paying ayce for him. He got 1 shrimp tempura while he waited for his food. I felt bad telling him to wait.

We got there around 3 pm and it wasnt too busy.  We got our drink orders in right away and got to order our first round.  We tried so many different rolls I dont even remember them.  I suggest this for people who have an appetite because they do come very long! WARNING: if u do not finish your food they charge extra like most AYCE. At the end lf the meal you are offered dessert either ice cream lr mochi ice cream.  We did the ice cream.  It tasted like its from baskin robins.  I could not even walk or even drive home after eating here! My tummy was so full.  But decent price for bomb food!",

The service is quick, but the middle age hostess kept trying to tell me what I was gonna eat... first pushing the all you can eat meal, suggesting meals for 2 etc. maybe she thinks I'm too skinny and she's trying to fatten me up lol. Then she got snappy with me when I asked for sashimi. She made some kind of comment about sashimi being the same thing sushi. I can't eat rice so I insisted I don't want sushi, I want sashimi. She snapped saying I just explained it to you. Take a look at the photo I attached. Does it not say sushi, not sashimi? Anyway, I'll be in the neighborhood at least 12 months so the next time I want sashimi, I'll do some investigating here and find some place else. If I want attitude from a stern middle aged woman, I'll go back to catholic school. The other staff were friendly. Honestly she alone is the reason for 3 stars. If it weren't for the other staff, this would be a 1 Star review.",

After the first few orders I was over it and wanted to leave. We ordered: Miso soup-came out cold, not even warm Scallop sushi-not fresh garlic tuna sushi-bad quality tuna drowned in ponzu sauce  seaweed salad-didn't taste fresh so didn't finish it yellow tail collar-came out last when we order it first. 1 star for the collar because how can you go wrong with fried fish Palm job handroll- lol $12 not worth it!!! We couldn't order it half size. It was basically soy paper with imitation crab meat drowned in spicy mayo and other sauces)   Service is so slow. Sushi men aren't even Japanese and we're talking in Spanish amongst each other. Worst bar sitting experience. We love talking/drinking with the sushi men which is why we always sit at the bar.

We ordered a whole bunch of appetizers and we were really impressed with them. Some of the sushi rolls have names that match with the Vegas style, which was hilarious.  Here are a couple items that I recommend:   The Giant Clam mix poki salad soft shell crab no name roll be mine volcano roll  The price is super cheap.

It's in a small strip mall next to Albertson's. We came across some bums, perverts (who hit on our girls), and a guy outside playing the guitar, holding a sign that said \"f*** you pay me.\" If you can look passed all that this sushi spot is worth the trip.      I'm giving this place a four star only because of the accommodations. It had a hard time accommodating our party of nine. We waited for 90 MINUTES before we were sat down at our table. The place is really tiny, so they tried to separate our party into two groups. If we would had agreed to split the group, the wait would have been about 70 minutes.        Now for the food part,.... it was scrumptious!! I can't say they were the best rolls ever, but we did finish every single roll. We left no stone unturned! Every roll that came to the table was perfectly displayed and tasted delicious. We ordered \"wet dream,\" \"happy ending,\" \"man whore,\" and a bunch of others. The baked muscles were also on point!       My advise to you is, if your coming for dinner expect this place to have an extended wait. There is not much room to sit and wait inside, so during the winter make sure to bring a warm jacket.",

Their rolls are awesome and huge yet contains a large amount of rice which is their trick to make you feel full. However, I think the food worth the money because you can't complain about sushi. I personally give this restaurant 3.5/5 because service isn't what I expected.",

We went during lunch hour and found it comfortably busy (i.e. we wouldn't be ignored, and the presence of others was reassuring). The decor is really cute as well.  We had all you can eat and ordered: vegas style roll, tiger roll, spicy tuna roll, tuna sushi, yellowtail sushi, miso soup, and two kinds of ice cream. Green tea is my favorite kind, but bf branched out and got red bean which was yummy! Everything was delicious and we left full and happy!",

I really wonder about the quality of the fish here.  It's easy to hide not-so-great fish in spiciness and funky sauces. And the couple of rolls that were supposed to have fresh fish instead of the typical spicy tuna mush -- The fish really lacked any flavor.  It wasn't rancid, but it definitely wasn't the freshest fish.  The rolls were fun but not fantastic -- There's nothing here that makes me say \"Holy sashimi, I HAVE to go back there again!\"  The price for all you can eat was pretty cheap, but I'd rather throw down a few extra $$$ and get some real quality fish.",

Our servers and additional staff was very attentive, we waited on average of 1-3 minutes for each of our rolls to come out.  For the I'm Turning Japanese roll it took a little longer because the yama yama is baked but it was our last roll so we didn't mind.  For $23 a person for AYCE it was more than worthwhile!  We had nine rolls, I think my favorite would be I'm Turning Japanese, or Son of a Beach.  We also had some Unagi which was very delicious and the pieces were big.  Each roll were in good proportions, none of that overfilled with rice crap.  I won't lie it was saucy, but we both prefer saucy so it didn't bother me.  The mango mochi ice cream was a little too cold but once it chilled it was good, but not as good as the red bean ice cream.  We will be back!",

    "text": "Recently tried Yama Sushi for the first time during a visit to Las Vegas. I used the mobile version of Yelp to find the place, but still had a bit of trouble since it's part of an outdoor shopping center with several establishments and the buildings are far back from the street. If you're looking for this place, look for the shopping center with the Albertsons on Flamingo and Maryland and you'll find this place.  Interior of the restaurant is small, but very clean. Tables are close together, but the sushi bar was packed so I sat at a table. There is a laminated menu with the special rolls, and a paper menu that your server will bring with the more standard fare. AYCE with tax is just shy of $23.00. A fantastic deal.  I was very pleased to see that half-orders were available for all rolls, even the special ones. This meant that since I was the only one eating sushi in my party, I was able to try several rolls. While I tried to pick rolls, I had the Albacore sushi (just ok) and the Salmon sushi (pretty good!). Both were served with large pieces of fish and just enough rice. I don't think I'd get the Albacore again, there was something about the texture I didn't like.  First up were the \"Man Whore\" rolls: Spicy salmon roll baked w/ a mixture of spicy tuna and cream cheese on top and served with spicy mayo and eel sauce. These were just okay. The baked topping was dry, possibly over-baked? Not sure. So, the Man Whore wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't awful, either.  Next were the \"Yama Crunch\": Tempura shrimp and crabmeat roll with a crunch layer on top. These were pretty tasty. They were served with a sweet sauce which was pretty good.  KAI Roll: Eel, cream cheese, avocado and spicy tuna roll w/ spicy tuna and avocado outside. Again, there was a sauce served with these rolls that was pretty good. I would have gladly had more of these and skipped the Man Whore rolls.  Last, but not least, the \"Wet Dream\". OMG. Delicious. These are a California roll baked with cream cheese and shrimp on top with a sweet yam sauce and eel sauce. Did I say DELICIOUS? These were the perfect end to the meal.  Service was fine. The place was VERY busy, but I barely would finish a plate of 4 pieces and the server would come around and ask if I wanted something else. It's also very noisy, but that's okay as long as the person next to you doesn't have an annoying celphone ring that goes off ever 2 minutes or so. Ahem.  I would definitely go here again if I'm with non-sushi diners. Otherwise, I'm still a fan of Sushi on Trop .. for now.",

    "text": "After having Oyishi sushi on Wednesday, I decided to truly compare the two highly rated AYCE sushi joints.   First of all, the restaurant is a bit small and crowded.  So try to plan ahead and make reservations or you might get stuck waiting in line for about 30 min or so.  The food was very fresh and tasty.  We started off with soft-shell crab, agedashi tofu, and a i love salmon roll.  The softshell crab was mediocre, i wasnt a big fan of the type of batter they used to fry the crab.  The agedashi tofu was small deep fried tofu in the normal agedashi broth, mediocre as well.  The ilove salmon roll was pretty much a philly roll but loaded with an excess amount of cream cheese.  Next up we ordered a mountain of nigiri from salmon, halibut, garlic tuna, uni, sweet shrimp, yellow tail and many more.  All were very very fresh and delicious.  Comparing quality to oyshi id say they are on the same level if not better.    There were 2 key items that made yama rise over oyshi, 1.) hamachi kama and 2.) unlimited mochi.  The hamachi kama was grilled to perfection and had a lot of flavor.  Unlimited mochi speaks for itself.  Overall i definitely recommend Yama, if you dont mind the drive down to flamingo and maryland.",

The nigiri is delicious, and they do not load up on rice on any of the sushi like some other AYCE places do. They also offer uni!   Everything we had was good quality by AYCE standards. The only thing to stay away from is the raw scallops - these taste like nothing and I suspect are some sort of imitation scallop.   This will definitely be my go to place in Vegas from now on!!",

Next was the yobo baked roll & then the spicy salmon roll. The spicy salmon was pretty spicy but just enough to enjoy. I didn't get the AYCE.  The music being played was top 40 radio. I usually enjoy a place with a little more selective playlist.",

    "text": "This was my first time at this AYCE sushi place and it was legit!!  All of their sashimi was fresh and really tender.  It's a small setting which makes it more intimate but they have a few other locations in Las Vegas as well.    The staff wear funny name tags, like our server's name tag said \"Filipino Mafia\" and the guy who filled our water, his name tag said \"Don't Remember\". This created really fun and entertaining dinner conversations.  Not to mention the names of some of their sushi rolls. (See photo).  This lets me know that they have a pretty good sense of humor while serving great tasting delicious food.    I will try their other locations the next time I'm in Vegas.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "So I fell into the \"Yelp Hype\" with Yama Sushi.  Pros: The wait staff was great, very friendly, and always checking on us. We didn't have to wait long to get drink refills and they addressed us as \"ma'am/sir\" the whole time. The Price is pretty good for AYCE sushi, its a little less then average by a couple dollars which was nice.   The place was clean, its not in the greatest neighborhood so the strip mall is a little shady but Yama Sushi was 4.5/5 for cleanliness and a 3/5 for decor.   Some cuts tasted fresh, others didn't. I know this changes daily but the salmon the day I went wasn't too great but the tuna and yellowtail were perfect.   Cons: EVERYTHING is super saucy! Either Panzu or spicy mayo! The nigiri was drenched in panzu sauce (I ordered 5 different cuts and 3/5 were swimming in panzu). It was hard to taste the fish itself. I can see why some people who like \"sushi\" would come here, they mask most of the fish taste so all you taste is sauce. If you're a purest when it comes to sushi, stay away... This place is designed for the \"Yeah I love sushi\" for Instagram type of person. If that's your thing, you'll love it here.   Another weird thing we noticed but it went away fast was the place had a weird smell. Nothing crazy but when we walked in it was pretty bad.   Overall I took off 3 stars because the main attraction (THE SUSHI) wasn't great. I'm sure the owners or the marketing team stay on top of their Yelp game with all these reviews but I didn't care for this place. I don't plan on going back. Go check it out for yourself (that's what I did) but if you're here for the weekend, don't waste a night out here, there are other places much more superior.",

    "text": "ALL YOU CAN EAT (AYSO) review only.  I was on my way to Makino Chaya's but a friend suggested this place. YAMA SUSHI is my new favorite AYSO sushi spot here in LV.   Food: Excellent. So many choices! -and the names of the dishes are funny and unexpected... especially from a Japanese place. I love it.  See posted photos from other viewers.   Price: Extremely reasonable for the AYSO.  $25 for dinner is really good for the all different options you get.   Staff: AMAZING, quick and super nice. --I'm referring to all 7 of them tho kept coming to the table to either fill up my water or asked if I would I needed anything.  Suggestion:  *Do a half order for your items (specialty rolls) so  you don't waste food + save room to try more items. *Don't fill up on water.  *You must eat everything (including rice the item comes with) or you will be charged. *be ready to order and clear a path for them to place your items when it arrives. -Also, stack the items neatly to a corner that's easily accessible for the waiter to retrieve. This is all just common sense & courtesy, but we live in a world of idiots who just can't figure it out.   I don't give places 5 stars very often. Everywhere I go its usually a 4 star average... but I'm definitely coming back here because of the price and quality in food AND service.",

There wasnt much of a wait and got seated immediately. There were 6 of us too! So we got seated in this little area that seemed like it's reserved for parties but we were in there with another group of 4. Small space but no biggie.   Our server's name was Casanova haha, I believe they used cute nicknames. The other nickname I saw was sweet land. Casanova was a cutie though (anywayyy--lol handing out compliments like candy here). We got waters all around and it came out immediately (A+).   We all opted for all you can eat. We got our first few orders in. They have quite a selection of sushis and the funniest name. They have one called the Harry Potter and some other naught ones too that I wont be typing out here lol but they're very \"vegas-like\".   The food came out fast and consistently. I really enjoyed all the rolls that I ordered. I got several appetizers as well. Some notable ones were the Uni, Soft shell crab, and tokoyaki. I got the tuna poki salad but it was really spicy and there was barely any seaweed salad in there.   We got mochi ice cream for our dessert and they were actually soft and not hard haha.   I'd like to say that I'd keep yama sushi as an option for all you can eat sushi. I enjoyed it and would come back :)",

I'm still new to writing reviews so that's why I haven't written about this place yet but my family has actually been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and counting. I was in elementary school when I first tried this place (before they remodeled and opened it up bigger), and now I'm in college. Crazy right? The service is also so good here and the servers are the sweetest. I remember coming here on a holiday once a few years ago and they gave us t-shirts! Now to the food. I don't need a menu to order. Hands down no name and turning japanese will ALWAYS be on the table. Superman is great if I'm feeling cream cheese. As for the appetizers, spicy seafood salad is THE BEST. Most sushi places don't serve this at lunch but Yama does. You really do get the best bang for your buck and it's pretty cheap compared to other places. Agedashi tofu, soft shell crab, baked and fried mussels, and hamachi kama never fail to make it to our order. I didn't even like tofu for the longest time but I would always eat the agedashi tofu. I really recommend trying the tempura UDON!! I have udon at every ayce place I can and no place beats Yama. The broth is so savory and the flavor is crazy I could eat their udon all day. I haven't found any ayce place that beats Yama and I'm sure you won't be disappointed if you try it out!",

It was a good size and left room to continuously eat and use the Happy Hour to it's full advantage.  However, it lost a star because our food was misplaced and given to another table.

A couple college buddies of mine brought me here for the first time several months ago, and ever since I've been hooked!  The quality of the sushi is excellent! While many of the meal item names are a little cheesy and racy (one minute man, hand job, wet dream!), there are some very interesting dishes that not only taste delicious, but also Yama Sushi goes to the length to make their dishes look like you're eating at a high scale sushi bar.   The times they have went have been very busy, but typically we wait no longer than 15 minutes each time to be sat. Service is friendly, quick, and the best part is that the service is organized and the waitresses are very sharp with remembering bulk orders.  Love, love, love! This has to be my new bread and butter sushi bar to go on a regular basis. :)",

I always get the Dragon roll and Superman roll, along with salmon and finish with the green tea ice cream.",

    "text": "In celebration of Saturday night, I tried THREE new places. First stop was Yama Sushi, as we were headed over to the east side and knew this was one place Yelpers love for AYCE sushi.   One piece of advice: if you are a small party, do not be tempted by the cozy little side room. Sit at the sushi bar. I decided to take one of the two tables in the little side room, and the table next to us was loud, which may make me sound like a prude, but they were blasting their own private dining soundtrack through a telephone. The sound was worse than a late 70s clock radio. It was a truly odd and rather unpleasant experience. I hope this is not a new trend.  The actual restaurant atmosphere was warm and full of energy. The place was slammed, without being chaotic, and the centerpiece of the room was a trippy-flower mural behind the sushi bar. The mural is composed of large panels of brightly colored photographs of poppies. (At least, I think they are poppies.) It reminded me of the scene in the Wizard of Oz when Dorothy and crew become intoxicated by the field of flowers-- the \"deadly poppy field.\"  But, there is nothing deadly about Yama, unless you can overdose on solid sushi. AYCE dinner is $22.95 and includes a decent variety. Yama gets bonus points for not over-ricing the rolls and for allowing you to order half rolls. (For what it's worth, I really liked their sushi rice; it was perfectly sticky and a bit sweet.) They also offer everything in a hand roll option, which brought intense delight to my boy. Shrimp tempura and eel hand rolls were arriving at the table by the tray full. I don't think they have the most creative rolls in town, but what they do have is done well.  Of course speed of service is very important at an AYCE establishment, and at Yama, it was speedy and sweet. Every server that came by our table had a warm smile, and they were all eager to bring more sushi to our tummy.  I will definitely return. (You will find me at the sushi bar avoiding the awkward room of too close dining.)",

Wait time can sometimes be long but well worth the price of how great the food is! also sakebombs are not badly priced. I normally spend about $50-60 dollars here on sundays nights. We got in about 10 3/4th sized sake bombs!  Pretty good / strong buzz! The rice in our stomach kept us from being TOO drunk! We plan on going to this place every other Sunday or at least once a month!  Very good place to go!",

The sushi roll names were catchy: Man whore, superman, wet dream, strip tease. You get the idea. Only in vegas!   I especially liked the wet dream. CA ROLL baked with cream cheese and topped with shrimp.   I also liked the TNT. Oh gawd! Delicious. Spicy tuna. jalapeno.. could have used more cream cheese but it was good. Because it was fried, the tuna had a new texture.. but it was awesome!!!  Go here with a big appetite!! I'm serious. Don't eat the whole day. Oh.. and bring your strechy pants because I wore skinny jeans.. and well, you get the picture! LOL.   Las Vegas, you've done well with your all you can eat sushi joints.

    "text": "Wow, Yama sushi certainly has changed since I was last here.  A couple years ago I used to go to Yama Sushi at least once a week, but since moving away from Vegas I have only been able to make it here about once a year or so. The other night I saw a side of Yama I had never seen before.   After reading recent reviews on Yelp I realized that Yama is fairly popular and busy now so we opted to go early about 4pm. Even at 4pm (on a Friday night) it was packed and only got more and more crowded as the night went on. For as crowded as they were I have to say that the service was fairly decent. It took 10-15 minutes for someone to get to us to take our initial order, but after that it was pretty smooth.  If you sit at the sushi bar you can give your order directly to the sushi chef, but if you sit at a table, like we did, the server will come around and ask what you want. You can order as many round as you like if you are ordering AYCE, which it seemed most people were. Things came out one-at-a-time which I liked as opposed to all arriving at once and they didnt take long at all, especially for how busy they were. As I said before I am still amazed at the quality of the sushi here for AYCE.  Again we ordered the seafood salad which is such a crazy deal to be included in AYCE. Basically it is a plate of sashimi chunks (ours was salmon, tuna and albacore) mixed with some hot sauce (you can choose none or mild as well) and placed on a bed of daikon. Thats it. Awesome.  Overall the sushi was of very good quality and the service was fine. Personally I dont care to eat in a VERY crowded environment with lots of loud people around, so Yama has been slightly tarnished in my book, but otherwise it is a great deal.",

    "text": "Maybe I had a bad day here. I always enjoy Yama everytime I come to Vegas but the last visit has made me never want to come back here ever again. Don't get me wrong, the food here is great and you can't beat $20 for all you can eat  for lunch. Came here with two other friends on our first day in Vegas.   We were really excited to have our friends try this place since I always rave about it so much. We started off with two orders of palm jobs and a few cut rolls. During the course of our meal, we also ordered the Hamachi Kama which is yellow tail collar. What came out from the kitchen was not that at all. The fish was dry and tasteless. My friend who also works at a japanese restaurant pointed it out that it was in fact not the collar cut that they had given us but in fact the part of the tail which explained why the fish was so dry. Other than that everything else was really good. Absolutely loved the spicy seafood salad! Make sure you try at least one and remember limit one per person!   Definitely make good use of it and try everything. I love how Yama lets you order a half roll instead of a full giving you more options to try a little bit of everything.  But like I said food was great, however service was utterly terrible. The hispanic looking girl we had serve us must've had a really bad day. From the moment she came to our table to the end of our meal she never failed to have a frown on her face. I can put up with bad service or slow servers, but this girl was flat out rude. We had a really sweet asian girl help us for most of our meal hence the 2 stars since our server was rarely ever at our table to help us. Towards the end of our meal we ordered ice cream to finish off. Our b*tchy waitress also happen to be the one who brought it out. She barely made it to our table before she tossed the bowls at us and walked away. I was so appalled that I literally grabbed for the check and took back our tip and left her with merely change. She didn't even have the decency to place the bowl on the table but rather yet threw it at us like we were dogs.   Overall: *1 star for the amazing food *1 star for the sweet asian server *Management should really look into retraining the server we had",

    "text": "I actually walked out of this place feeling pretty criminal, as I ate WAY more than twenty three bucks worth of sushi. I've mentioned in previous reviews that I'm teaching my teenaged brother all the important gourmet things in life, so he doesn't grow up an uncultured twat. All you can eat sushi is a pretty awesome way to let him go nuts on different sushi without fear, especially now that he can use chopsticks without looking like a doofus.   The food: well, it's not Katsu of Chicago, but what the fuck is, you know what I'm saying? The rolls are good but not astoundingly creative, the fish was fresh, the price was right. \"Sun on the Beach\", labeled 'best', was indeed best of the rolls I had - it was appropriately kicky. The roll with the squid in it was also good, as the squid was well and fresh.  In addition to the rolls, I had the giant clam and octopus - octopus was a bit chewy but within reason. Giant clam was lovely. I topped this off with red bean ice cream, which was the perfect end to my meal.  Service: waitress very efficient, didn't notice any hassling about time limit or how much I was ordering. She kept the water refreshed like it was her life's work. Sushi chefs typically brusk. It's not like you pay them to be friendly, you pay them to roll and slice as fast as possible.  My teenaged brother was very impressed, and for the price we will probably be trying to hit this place regularly. Can't beat a steal.",

Chunks of salmon, tuna, snapper dressed with a very addictive rice wine vinaigrette and shredded turnip.  Mackeral was good. I love it despite its oily fishiness. It's one of my favorite textures to eat.  Service was fast and friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to groups because you can share and eat a crapton of different items.

Unlike most AYCE sushi joints, Yama offers uni, hamachi kama, sweet shrimp, etc. (limit 1 plate per person for most). There's almost never a wait, and the sushi quality is decent for what you're paying.   There's several items that I always get. The uni is a coin flip, but I've had pretty good tastings recently. I like the sweet shrimp, but I'm not a fan of the fried variety that accompanies it. The hamachi kama is huge and is sure to fill you up. My favorite roll to order is the wet dream, which comes as a baked cali roll with shrimp, cream cheese, and finished with sweet yam sauce. I always end with an order of white tuna nigiri (buttery goodness).   If you don't like rice, start with the seafood salad, which is a poor man's chirashi bowl. Skip the soft shell crab, which is too fried for my liking. Lastly, save room for dessert as you can order ice cream mochi and two scoops of ice cream. The mango mochi is fantastic and I'm a big fan of the green tea and plum ice creams.",

For about $25, I was stuffed with what was actually decent sushi and tasty rolls.  No, you are not going to get sashimi, and the fish quality is middle of the road, but it is not bad.  There are also some cooked items, like salmon collar, which are really tasty.  I can't make any specific recommendations, since I don't recall the names of the things we had, but nothing came out that I shied away from (except the uni, which I don't eat even at the really good places).",

No buffet, pretty much just order whatever you want off the menu.  Good with 3-4 people, everyone shares, try a lot of things that way.",

I know CRAZY. but that what makes visiting this restaurant even better. This visit was on a Sunday night with 7 other people. A Full restaurant at that. but they service is always great, it was good this time.. we had a couple dishes we didn't order placed on our table. Then we noticed one that had been on our table for about 20 minutes and the waitress took it and gave it to the table behind us.!! WHAT?! now that was just terrible (what if we sneezed on it, which we didn't ) but not okay with any of us. The price for AYCE dinner is $24.95 I believe. Staff is all friendly. The Restaurant is clean. Always a line out the door/people waiting outside for a table. Good sign right?! I would say if you like sushi this is a place to go!",

There's a heaping portion of cubed and sliced sashimi of tuna, yellowtail, and salmon. The spicy sauce was slightly tart and did not overpower the fish.   We also had some sashimi, Harry potter roll, hamachi kama, wet dream roll, and the soft shell crab appetizer (which was overlooked).   You can have one mochi and two icecreams per person with the all you can eat. We enjoyed a chocolate mochi, vanilla mochi, and a plum ice cream.",

As a positive, I noticed the service was very fast and efficient...food orders came out quickly, orders were taken, drinks refilled, etc.  But the quality and cuts were not very impressive.  And they added a very sweet ponzu to a lot of the nigiri...distracting actually.  Perhaps to hide the quality of fish?  The ahi / tuna nigiri I was served was actually embarrassing...I didn't even take a photo of it LOL.  Just a really rough cut, poor coloring, and did not taste fresh even during a fully-packed night.  The amaebi was not cut/butterflied like all others I've had before, so it was a bit chewy and didn't melt in your mouth.  The uni was also runny in consistency.  Besides the sake / salmon, I didn't really taste anything \"fresh\" in my opinion.  I just wasn't impressed with anything here....but I found plenty to be underwhelmed.   Good luck!",

These are the names of some of the creative and more popular rolls in case you were wondering.  Premium Sushi. All You Can Eat. Great Deal!  Atmosphere: Yama Sushi is located off the strip and hidden next to a CVS within an Albertson's parking lot.  This secret gem is one of the places that I visit whenever I'm in town and I'm always sure to bring along my friends...and so far all have given the thumbs up!  The restaurant is small, but depending on what time you arrive finding a seat is not a problem.  The decor is what you expect, nothing more and nothing less.  Staff: Very friendly and attentive.  Sushi is served quick and fast.  Appetizers are also made to order and delivered in a timely manner.  The sushi chef's are all well trained.  Jun the manager is the man!  I highly recommend sitting at the bar in front of him and asking for him to surprise you with his tasty secret treats.  Food: Let me say this again...the sushi is premium.  Not the crap you find at other chain sushi spots like Niko Niko.  This is why you gotta love Vegas and the daily drops of the freshest of the fresh fish from around the world.  The AYCE menu consists of everything from appetizers, salads, soup, sushi, handrolls, cut rolls, and dessert.  Yes you can get as much red bean, green tea ice cream or mango mochi as you want!  All the appetizers are yummy.  I especially like the bbq ribs, the soft shell crab, and the hamachi kama.  These alone give you your money's worth!  I've been to this place many many times over the last 5 years and my favorite sushi is the \"Sexy Salmon\" just like a normal salmon sushi, but with a thin slice of lemon, jalapeno, and ponzu sauce.    **Tip 1: If you don't want to fill yourself too fast try ask for a 1/2 order of the rolls instead.  This gives you about 4 pieces of the roll rather than 8.  **Tip 2: If you feel adventurous or enjoy a good handroll ask for one of their specialty rolls, but as a handroll i.e. the TNT roll as a handroll.  If you're there and sit by the bar try to find my business card...hint it's the only bright red one with a thumbprint on it.",

My sister lives just outside of the strip, and as we joked about how to properly expand our stomachs for Thursday's impending feast, she raved about Yama Sushi.   I've never been to an all you can eat Sushi place with such high quality rolls. The food was great, brought out to the table as it was made. The service was wonderful, and again, the food was great. I think I took care of 35 pieces before I called uncle. Uncle was impressed. Somehow I saved room for dessert, and the interesting ice cream flavors were a nice contrast to the pounds of raw fish and rice I had eaten.   I vow to return each time I'm in Sin City to indulge in the sin of gluttony. Sweet, delicious, gluttony.",

They offer all the premium sushi as well at no extra charge. It's the only place I will eat uni at since it's normally pricey. The fish has a nice a consistency to it as well. I suggest trying the seafood salad,it's all sashimi with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce. They also include dessert in the all you can eat price.  The establishment is extremely clean and the staff is amazing! From the moment you walk in you are greeted and seated almost immediately. As soon as you are seated a waitress will come by and take your orders for beverages. We always had full beverages, we didn't have to sit around waiting for someone to come by and ask if we were ok. If you want excellent service, this place is impressive.   I can't wait until my birthday since it will be the next time I get to eat some sushi there.

Do the All-you-can-eat (roughly $25/person dinner)...the sushi is freshly made when you order. A lot of custom sushi rolls with creative names like \"one minute man\" and \"man whore.\" Go in a group and order as many rolls as you want because you can all share. They say they'll charge you if you don't finish everything but I don't think they really do.   Highly recommend this place!",

We each ordered the all-you-can-eat and shared our selections with each other.  It was a great sushi experience in a casual, comfortable setting.  The only negatives I can think of are that the location is too small, they definitely need more space, and they were really busy, which caused a mix up of our returning change...first I got too little and then I got too much.  But all of that was minor considering the awesome sushi we had. Only improvement I would suggest is to add more room cause they definitely have people waiting to be seated!",

    "text": "Ask any sushi aficionado who has been in Las Vegas for at least one week where the best rolls may be had and the answer is always Yama Sushi.  Located in one of the city's lower-class areas, this strip-mall inhabitant does serve some of the best, freshest and most innovative fare in the genre.  Another of those AYCE places - All You Can Eat - Yama offers its own take on both the traditional , read: Sea Urchin, California Roll, etc. and the new and/or unconventional, such as rolls with provocative name like Happy Ending and Minute Man.  Crunch is the newest element to pervade American sushi, and it is in great supply here, with Panko doing its best to supply the umami.  With individual prices up to $16.95 per roll, even a finicky diner may almost eat a couple of hundred dollars worth of good food for a lunch price of $22.05, with tax.  I enjoyed my favorite, Ikura, a.k.a. Salmon Roe, with the addition of a raw quail egg slithering atop.  The large, ruby pearls burst a refreshing brininess which complimented the unctuousness of the tiny egg.  Other winning rolls are pretty much anything listed, though my palate leans toward the spicy and sauced versions.  Special items allow one per customer, and are marked accordingly.  These include a nicely fried soft shell crab and Salmon Hama, or Cheek of Salmon, a veritable slab of barely cooked salmon meat which could be a nice, small meal in itself, with a bowl of the salty Miso soup and a seaweed salad.  Service can be a bit like a roller coaster, sometimes right on target, other times perfunctory.  And, as with many Asian eateries in this country, their website is, to put it mildly, a disaster.   But you are not going to the restaurant for their web skills, right?  As with any AYCE locale, sushi or otherwise, arrive hungry and do not rush.  Also, pay attention to the menu's various disclaimers and warnings, including one advising diners to eat ALL their rice, lest they be charged for ala carte dining.  A bit harsh, but these creations are not average, buffet-style chunks of rice with a rumor of fish.  They are full-bodied and flavorful, so... eat it and enjoy!",

    "text": "After hearing that there is no good sushi in Las Vegas due to a lack of ... Oceans ... I decided to venture out into the desert wilderness a 5 min drive down flamingo road from Caesers Palace to the restaurant.  The place was bustling with patrons, waiting in every available seat and standing inside and outside waiting for a table.  Obviously, this place was well known and popular.  A good sign indeed.  I went inside and was miraculously seated at the bar without any wait (birthday luck I guess).  I embarked on the best all you can eat (ayce) sushi experience ever.  Fresh fish, balanced proportion of rice to fish (an ayce rarity) and the most expedient and friendly sushi chefs.  I tried the Yama roll and something with soy paper, soft shell crab, scallop and crunchies that melted in my mouth. Let's not forget the 4 orders of mouth wattering albacore, my two handrolls, and a reorder of the Yama roll as a handroll.  When it was all done I even got mochi ice cream and regular ice cream.  Ayce + dessert in the desert was a rare bonus.  For $23 bucks for dinner, I will be coming back here everytime I come to Vegas.  The service staff were so unbelievably attentive and nice; going above and beyond.   This place deserves 6 stars.  I'm going to dream about these rolls now; don't go anywhere else, this is the real deal.  YamaZing!",

I went on a Friday night and there was a 50 minute wait to get seated. They do not take reservations so I could not have called in advance.  When we finally got seated, the ordering began. Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. I quickly ordered all the rolls I've scoped down on the internet based on reviews here. The rolls looked delectable and the taste was good for the first few bites. After I wharfed down a roll though, the fun wore off and I realized the sushi was good but not THAT good. What I did not like was every roll was drizzled with a sweet mayonnaise or eel sauce. There was hardly a roll we ordered that did not contain some form of cloying rich sauce. For our final roll (as we were reaching our intake limit), we asked our waiter if there was a roll that was lighter and not drenched in sauces. He recommended the happy ending roll. This was a light salmon roll topped with sliced lemons and scallions..pretty light and refreshing.  There were plenty of other options on the all you can eat menu other than sushi. One dish I thoroughly enjoyed and got seconds and thirds of were the green shell mussels. I forgot what it was called but there were only 2 mussel dishes and one was battered. I'm talking about the non-battered cheaper mussel item. The desserts were also very good. I especially recommend the red bean ice cream!  I'm giving this place 4 stars because I'm sure there are better all you can eat sushi places out there that do not load their rolls with so much sauce, I couldn't even taste the fish in the rolls anymore.",

    "text": "Yelper Elnino F. and I came for noms and left disappointed.   APPETIZERS- Soft Shell Crab- big, good and very crisp panko breading. Sashimi Salad- spicy and tangy. very generously big portion of mixed fish- mostly tuna, salmon though Saba- grilled saba was pretty decent  ROLLS-  No Name- recommended and popular. I ordered a half and the guy gave me a whole roll. I wouldn't have minded if it was good, but it was sauce flavor and not much else. It had just one piece of tempura surrounded by too much rice,soy paper, thin slice of fish outside and a lot of sweet sauce, mayo and crunchies. There wasn't a marriage of flavor here with the ingredients- just sauce and rice.   I dared to get no more rolls but tried a few pieces of Elnino's and the rolls were just about the sauce. All rolls are cali, spicy tuna, tempura based or mayo scallop and I was hoping for more fish based rolls.   NIGIRI-  Yellowtail- it was okay and not as fresh/flavorful as I hoped Albacore- this was seriously fucking disgusting. It was mushy and fell apart in my mouth. WTF? I've had some mediocre pieces in AYCE but this fish was seriously mishandled in defrosting to get such a bad mouth feel. Mackerel-  This was fine and good so I ordered a bunch of this. Salmon- this was alright as far as salmon goes.  Eel- good, but that's pretty standard eel from a package so how can you screw up?  They slice the fish big, but the rice was also big. It wasn't proportional ratios of rice to fish on most orders.  I do not like that everything was presliced as that also affects the texture of fish if it isn't used right away. The rice was warm as it should, but too warm that some of the more delicate fish become warm with it and doesn't make for the optimal flavor or mouthfeel of what nigiri is- firm,cool fish marrying with a lightly warm, fluffy rice.   Service was decent. The servers were on the refills of drinks and our server was nice and made suggestions at the beginning to let us know that's popular. We were checked on and asked several times if they can put any appetizer orders. The sushi men were busy but orders came out in a reasonable amount of time. A few things were forgotten, but probably good since the rice was filling and I was ordering like I would at any other joint. One thing that bothered me as we were sitting and waiting on our first order, I was talking to Elnino about my favorite sushi spot and the sushi guy chimed in how it  is no good and defended how theirs is way better. That bothered me as they weren't asked to be in the convo and most importantly it didn't deliver competitively on the freshness and fair rice ratio.   I was thinking hard about the rating, but this is definitely a place I won't return to. The albacore was the worst I've ever had and I can't shake off how unappetizing it was to continue after that piece. I like to have variety but I was put off and stuck to mackerel as it was the only thing I knew was good.   I had this on my \"Must Try\" based on some rave reviews from Yelper friends but I looked back and I see that most of those were from over a year ago. Something must have changed. Yes the price people keep talking about, but seriously $22.95 isn't really that much of a price discount from most $26.95 places that for the $4 are much better. This place was packed but it was mostly roll type people and college kids. There isn't a good AYCE nearby as competition either.   I'm with Anna S.- don't believe the hype!",

I never gave it a chance because looking at it from the bank all I saw was a big red sign that said SUSHI. That and it's location on the east side was a red flag to me.   Finally, about a month ago I finished my meetings and I was so hungry I didn't care about previous red flags. When I got close enough I saw that this was THE Yama Sushi I've heard about from so many people. Definitely made me happier walking in to try it out.   It was packed but I was solo so I didn't wait long for a seat at the bar. Compared to other AYCE spots I found the menu very intriguing from the start because of the sexually themed rolls. I base my review of AYCE sushi places based on the quality of the sushi since I don't get a lot of rolls. My favorite place (I won't name it) still has better quality sushi but the quality here is very good and the portions are massive! The sushi they laid across the rice was probably 3 times the size of my favorite place. To wrap up my night there I had to order the Manwhore roll. The presentation was amazing and the roll was great too! To top it off the service was great! Even though I was at the bar every single server asked me if I needed anything. Sometimes I can't even get a refill of water sitting at the bar at other places.   Don't let the east side location deter you. Definitely check this place out if you haven't. I'll be working this place into my Thursday sushi rotation for sure!",

Nothing out of the ordinary that we can't get in LA.  What I did like is that you can actually order half rolls, so the bf and I were able to sample a greater variety than we would at home. Pretty much every roll we ate was very good. Spicy dishes are actually pretty spicy though.  All sushi came with a lot of rice though, especially the sashimi. And on that note, the sashimi was just okay and didn't seem super fresh.  Special one order per person items: hamachi kama (baked hamachi - tender and juicy, a little too fishy for my taste but the bf loved it), sweet shrimp, seafood salad (sashimi pieces over raddish), giant clam sashimi (meh didn't know what to expect).  In the end, perhaps I'm spoiled in LA, but I can probably get about the same at home for less $$.",

We also ordered the \"who's your daddy roll\" , a bunch of sushi pieces like the yellowtail, salmon, tuna, garlic tuna, and hand rolls like the spicy tuna. There was nothing fishy about their food and their service was Great. Our server Isha was so nice and attentive. She was actually the one who gave so many great recommendations.   I really enjoyed my meal and I don't say that alot especially when its AYCE.  It was suprisingly good and the portions were very friendly. So eat up and try to hit up this spot. 20.95 for lunch and 23.95 for dinner.   Worth the stop!",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I wish we had a Yama Sushi where I'm stationed in GA, however each time I am TDY to Nellis AFB I visit Yama at least once.  The most recent visit was only a few months ago.  I usually go solo, as such it's easy for me to find a singleton seat at the bar--right in front of the sushi construction artists.  Other people have complained about not getting seated right away, or not getting their food in a timely manner.  I would say that as long as the faults weren't too egregious, this is to be expected with such a popular busy little restaurant. Me personally on a past visit here I was crammed at the end of the bar near the oven which serves up the cooked sushi, and while it was far from ideal seating-wise, I can appreciate that this restaurant tries to find as much seating as possible--maybe to a fault but certainly didn't ruin the experience. The food served up has, for me, always been a wonderful experience.  The sushi cuts are consistently good, I haven't found the rice too bland, too dry, or too overbearing, and there's LOTS of \"special roll\" choices for those that purchase the AYCE plan.  Yama Sushi incorporates a lot of sauce, but imho they're not too heavy-handed with it.  I usually get the 'Man Whore', 'No Name', 'Wet Dream', 'Happy Ending', and 'Oh Dam Harry' but do not forget about the appetizers and salads; if you like spicy sushi, then you MUST try the 'Seafood Salad' which is basically a spicy sashimi salad with a hint of garlic and a lot of awesomeness--you'll thank me if you do.  Again from my experience you could try most of their abundant special roll selections and come away satisfied. I was here once with a buddy who couldn't finish the last 2 pieces of his roll, this usually generates an additional fee.  However the older lady waitress just laughed at him (which was funny in and of itself) and let him off scot-free without paying extra.  Yeah it's only a little thing, but it meant something to us. Bottom line: I might have had better quality sushi elsewhere, had better served sushi presentations elsewhere, or cheaper sushi elsewhere, however dollar for dollar Yama Sushi is by far my fav place for sushi ANYWHERE.",

The waiters are still attentive and pleasant but one of the actual sushi chefs could work on his attitude. While ordering food here, he cut me off and said that is good enough for now and moved on to the next customer. The rice on the roll was hard. I'm positive he was aware of it as well since it would've been impossible for him not to feel the old, hard rice while making the roll. We're not going back to this place. We now go to Doh sushi. It's way bigger and the quality of the food is way better than Yama's.",

Doesn't matter if someone isn't ur immediate server, if they are near u, they will ask if u need anything. I love that! The only downfall is that it's so busy on some nights, that there is a long wait period to get seated. It doesn't affect my review tho! I've been to many different sushi places, but this has to be my favorite. From the amazing rolls, to the service, to the atmosphere, this place gets 2 thumbs up from me. My only suggestion is possibly moving the location somewhere else or even expanding business to other areas. Too many instances where there's some crazy person outside yelling obscenities. Haha. Keep up the good work, Yama Sushi! :)",

I've had: Sesame Chicken, Green Mussels, Soft Shell Crab, Philadelphia Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Salmon Roll, Red Clam roll (so pretty), Giant Clam Roll, Yellowtail Roll, & Seawood Salad from what I can remember.  I know there's more, but I'll have to update when I remember.  When I went this visit, sounded like \"No Name\" was a popular roll, but I was too full to order anything else.  I have yet to find anything that I don't like...  My only gripe is that its a little squishy... small place.  I've never had to wait more than 5 mins, but it is really popular, so Im positive there is a wait during busy times.",

The service was quick, the servers were polite, and great about helping you choose tasty delights.  Everytime I come here, its PACKED! so expect a 20-45 (or longer) wait to be seated. And another thing to consider is the size- yes most sushi places are small but considering the volume of people coming in and out- you'd think they'd opt for more space. I dont mind waiting because the food is totally worth it!  AYCE Lunch special $21.99+, Dinner special $24.99+",

The first time I went with a group of people from my office and the place was PACKED at like noon on a Tuesday.  We ordered all kinds of stuff- all of it delicious!  Wish I could remember which ones I LOVED, ah well, I'll update the next time I go!  Save room for mochi.  The strawberry is the best, but the vanilla is gross.  Hopefully I will be able to try the ice cream next time.  I took a co-worker who was in town to Yama and she really enjoyed the sushi too!

There were three in our party. We didn't have a wait. The menu notes charging for wasted food and a max time to sit and eat. All normal notices for AYCE places.  Let me highlight our experience: 1.  The freshest sushi ever had 2.  Sushi cuts of fish were a good size 3.  The rolls were normal size and you get 8 pieces 4. AYCE appetizers were not small servings 5.  Cooked food was very good 6.  Desserts were absolutely delicious the best tasting green tea and red bean ice cream we ever had. Not one ice crystal to be found. The best tasting chocolate mochi ever had  7.  At least six (6) sushi chefs at the bar 8.  In addition to the servers they have many other staff serving food, refilling beverages and bussing tables.  This resulted in never asking for refills, someone always checking in to see if you wanted to order more and the table being cleared regularly instead of dishes pilling up.   Measures: 1.  Quality of food - 10 2.  Quantity for value - 10 AYCE 3.  Service experience - 10 4.  Overall Cleanliness - 8 5.  Service 10 Overall value 9.6 = 5 stars  We were here yesterday for dinner, see review above for that experience and again for dinner. Our wait wasn't too long maybe 20 mins. My review of tonight experience of Yama Sushi was exactly the same as last nights.   Definitely coming back and telling friends and family",

It's $23.99 for dinner and it's all the sushi, maki and nigiri your heart desires. They do have some rules: you have to eat all the rice and not just the fish because there's an extra charge. Also, any leftovers will have an extra charge too. The quality of the fish is good and fresh. The size of the sushi is decent too and they aren't overstuffed. All of the rolls here have a Vegas theme. One of my favorite rolls here is The Who's your Daddy (watch out for the spicy oil on it), Spicy Sexy Roll (I like spice), tako nigiri (cuz AYCE octopus is amazing).   !!!",

I played around $54 for 2 around 630pm.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: the host and manager were Amazing! The waitress not so much but it was understandable. It was definetly packed inside.",

I took s a friend in hopes it was better than the last time and we didn't want to drive or go to Sakana since they are almost just as bad as Yama Sushi.   The fish is hella low grade, no flavor with too much rice. I'm unsure where the Chefs receive their training but please stop making bad sushi!!! It's a disservice to those that appreciate the art of sushi.",

The wait time isn't that bad. We came on Monday night for dinner and the wait time is only 30 mins.   I would totally recommend getting the nigiri And some of the apps. The rolls are good, but I don't think it's really worth it. The most favorite thing to get is the soft shell crab, the salmon nigiri and the edamame. The fish here isn't sushi grade, but it's still delicious enough to enjoy.   The staff here are super friendly, but for some reason they don't seem to offer the best service ever. My table had four people. Two people kept having their glass of water filled while two isn't getting anything. I was one of the two that kept getting water refilled. My friend asked the waitress for water. When she came she filled my glass and not my friend. She got fed up and when she saw my glass getting filled she asked for water.   I would totally recommend coming here cause I love sushi and it is cheap.",

I only eat seafood and Las Vegas buffets are total shit now so this place is one of the few that still serves THE BEST FOOD in town. Service is incredibly fast. I have no idea how they do it. I have been to many sushi bars and there is some wait but not in this place. It is quick, very quick. But the mot important thing is that food is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!! Baked Green mussels is my favorite. Saba and white tuna is my favorite too. Salmon skin hand roll and eel hand roll are incredible. By the time I try all the sushi on the menu (just don't order sea urchin) I have no more room in my belly for the rolls. I am sure they are very delicious too. For some reason I always overeat here. There must be the reason though.",

I would say the special rolls were plentiful and sized just right without being overly obnoxious for eating. The service is excellent in that they are very friendly and attentive without making you feel rushed. The restaurant itself is very clean and the dining environment is cozy with plenty of room to sit and spread those elbows while trying to use chopsticks without looking like a fool.

SO, this is a new concept for us, and a delightful one. My husband and I were like, whaaaa? $24 for all you can order/eat sushi rolls AND appetizers AND dessert? For reals? He added it up, and we had ordered around $85-90 of food for $48 for two of us.   It IS off the strip a ways, so do not try to walk there. Uber, taxi, whatever, it's still worth it imo. However, don't be scared if your driver turns down weird, dark streets. This place is in a strip mall, and looks very non-descript. My husband was like, are you sure? And I was like, yeah, Yelpers said so. And then, he was like, all smiles. We were in sushi heaven, and I had a big \"I told ya so.\"   As far as what to get, idk. We were so overwhelmed, I'm not sure what we ordered :) but it was all good. Except the Trust Me, Baby roll. (I couldn't trust it). It seemed like Mexican sushi to me, with weird red hot sauce on it. Um, no.   We were stuffed, so just one mochi for each--mango for him, chocolate (um, the BOMB) for me. So, a long story is ending now. We plan to go back before our stay in Vegas ends...yeah, it's like that.  Update: so we did return! However, there are 2 locations, one off Flamingo Rd (weird layout) and one sort of northwest-ish (sorry dk address). The second one had a better, brighter atmosphere. However the servers there had a'tude, it seemed. U judge. Both good",

I prefer to sit at the bar area as some of the tables are extremely cramped together. Some dont mind but it's a little frustrating for me. They have these thin paper foldable paper walls?? Between each table but you're so close to others all you can do is overhear their loud conversations.   They offer half rolls which is great for those that dont eat a lot or want to try a something new. However if you dont eat all of your sushi they add an additional charge which is kinda ridiculous to me but hey that's why you order a half roll I guess.   Customer service is pretty good. Sushi chefs are nice! I do recommend trying the dragon roll. Its phenomenal.",

Take note, some items can be ordered only one per person such as ama ebi nigiri, hamachi and salmon kama, uni nigiri, palm roll.

The sushi was decent quality and the rolls are pretty good but the place doesn't look super clean and everything is drenched in Ponzu sauce. I don't know I like Ponzi sauce but for everything to taste the same way because of the sauce was kind of annoying. The staff is pretty friendly and for all you can eat it's decent price pretty much standard. I don't know the vibe was off for me and the sushi was was just meh",

I ordered some albacore and ama ebi, as well as the no name roll, crazy roll, oh dam!! harry roll, and two scoops of green tea ice cream. It was pretty worth it for the $21 (lunch price). I enjoyed everything except the ama ebi and the crazy roll, just because I'm not a fan of deep fried foods. The service was surprisingly good, so I would come to this location again.  P.S. just make sure you keep track of what you've ordered because we did not receive all the rolls we ordered.",

I am really glad that I found Yama sushi because it seems to have decent reviews. I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I ordered some nigiri including yellowtail, ikura (salmon roe), tamago and uni (sea urchin).  I wouldn't say that the sushi is top-notch or anything but the fish tasted fresh and the service was quite decent. I am also very happy to know that there's a reasonable sushi restaurant close to most of the hotels.",

What lured me in was the price which was only $20 for AYCE lunch.   When I first walked in, I noticed this restaurant had tables that were placed closely together. Some tables were big enough for a party of 4, but had a divider in the middle. Not the place to go to for private conversations.  My experience with service was below average. There were plenty of staff working the day I went, but I understand that some people are hosts, runners, servers, etc. and may not be able to help out in certain areas of the restaurant. As a girl was coming up to my table to refill water, I kindly asked for her to find the server to order more food (at this point, we had already been waiting). We did not see another server for another 15 minutes.  As for the food, it was not fresh.. we ended up going home with a really bad stomach ache. There's not really much to say after that.",

    "text": "By recommendation from a friend who has been here before, but a long time ago, we decided to try Yama Sushi while we were on our Vegas vacation trip. This place has the AYCE option but it is a very different method of AYCE. There is no list where you mark what you want to order each round; instead, the servers take down your order \"little at a time\" [as recommended on the menu]. Basically you order 2-3 item each time your server comes to you and if they don't you need to keep flagging them down. Our server even got upset when another server took one of our orders. ooohhk?... Now, all this really this doesn't make sense if the restaurant is busy, I can't imagine how much of a chaos it would be. Luckily we came during early lunch when it wasn't too bad right at opening.   I love sushi and every time I do AYCE sushi, I go for mainly nigiri rather than any of the rolls. Getting BANG for the buck, if you know what I mean! The only roll I would get is the spider roll and although it was small, it was good because it wasn't filled with filler imitation crab like in other sushi places. I'd give them that. For the nigiri, I ordered the uni (wasn't fresh) and sweet shrimp (cold like it had been pre-prepped) on top of my regular tuna, ikura, masago, and eel. Tuna wasn't that fresh either but the eel was good so we ordered quite a few to share. My boyfriend got a few rolls and nigiri but one thing he noted was the saba was good.  Overall, I don't think we'll be coming back especially if there are so many other options in Vegas. AYCE sushi joints in California are all relatively the same with marking your order for each round on the slip of paper. It just honestly makes more sense and I really have no idea why Yama Sushi does it this way.",

I had to sit more in the middle of the table, but with a 4 top, that meant one person was sitting on the edge super close to the next table.   As for the food, it was good. It's near the college, so if you're in the area and want some sushi, it's worth it. If you don't live in the area, then I wouldn't recommend making the drive.   The service was ok. We did have to keep asking for refills, and we got a roll we didn't order (which was still good), and had to ask for one of the items they forgot about.

    "text": "A couple of years ago this place was definitely a five star establishment. Good service, nice price point for AYCE, and really solid rolls. However, quality control has been on the continuous decline.  The fish is no longer fresh tasting. Point, blank, period. The eel and eel sauce specifically, had almost a rancid taste to it the night we went. Many of the Rolls and even nigiri are heavily drenched in sauces, so you can't really enjoy the flavor of the fish. Icing on the cake, a few hours later my husband and I had excruciating stomache aches for the remainder of the night, that even carried on to the next day. Even though it is in a crap area, the service is still great but that doesn't really matter when the product is so bad.  I can't speak for their other locations, as I've heard the Spring Mountain location is still good quality, but unfortunately we will not be returning to this location.",

Although I didn't order it to be spicy option, the dressing was a little spicy. I should have requested the dressing on the side.   I ordered nigiris. They are small so I could enjoy various kinds of nigiri. They were good. I had to be careful not to order too much. If there is any leftovers, I would be charged.

The waitress ordered for us their popular items and gave each group a serving of it. They took charge and was not hesitant in helping us :).   I was surprised at how fast the sushi was made as well. Probably within minutes they had 45 orders of salmon nigiri sent to our table. They catered to our needs and were super receptive to them as well.  The sushi itself was fresh and flavorful! My only issue (which is why I docked it down a star) was the amount of rice. They gave a lot of rice for nigiris and that is usually the deal breaker for me :(.",

My favorite dishes are the seafood salad (ask for it not too spicy if you're a weenie like me), the no name roll, and the sun of a beach roll. I think they put too much cream cheese in their rolls so I usually avoid those.",

They didn't have anything with octopus in it( I love me some octopus). We waited for about 40 minutes and the service was not good. I had one of the servers ask me what I was drinking to refill it, waited and waited she made her next round and looked at my cup and asked what I was drinking again as if she had never even asked . I looked at her name tag and turns out she's a supervisor, ahhh. She would just bring the water pitcher and fill the drinks up with pitcher about and inch away from my face didn't say excuse me or anything. The food wasn't anything fantastic  , was not worth the wait , given it was a Friday night and sushi places are always jammed packed they disappointed with the service and the okay sushi.",

There's Todai, which is alright, there was another one with a time limit, and the quality sank with every new order, and then this place.  It's crowded with good reason.  You sit down, place your order, and the carousel begins.  They hand you sushi as fast as you can eat it, and take you empty plates just as fast to replace it with all new foods.  Seriously, it was like I had ninja as my servers, and they were on top of things, from food, to drink orders, to pretty much whatever I needed.  They forgot an order or two (I never got my miso), but I couldn't say anything, because all I had to do is reorder, and problem solved.  The food quality was awesome, and each dish was better than the last.  I was on a serious sushi buzz by the time my meal concluded, and I was a very comfortable full, not the grossly overstuffed full.  I was not at a loss for good sushi here.  I almost felt overwhelmed because the service was so quick (but not pushy), and it was like recovering from one awesome treat to a whole new delight instantly.  The sushi names are silly, but it just added to the fun of the night.  Try the garlic tuna.  That was pretty much good times right there.  Go hungry before you come here.  Believe me, you'll get your fill.  And quickly.",

The price for the all you can eat sushi was good, $20-25 a person is great when getting all you can eat.  if you are looking for quantity of food this is the route to go. If you are looking for quality sushi I would not eat at Yama. Between our group we probably tried 3/4 of the specialty sushi on the menu and we were not impressed at all! All of the sushi was just MEH not that good. I will never go back to Yama there was nothing there for me there.",

All you can eat dinner for $23. Quality is a solid 4 stars, much much better than any of those todai sushi buffets.   Best of all, they bring it out AS ITS MADE, not in those huge plates that make you wait for an hour before you get your first bite. So when you make a big order to the waitress, expect the first piece to come within 5 minutes.   ANYTHING on their menu is fair game, for the all you can eat, that includes the appetizers, fried food (soft shell crab was delicious)  and any fixins you may want.  This place is las vegas gem. Off the strip, none of the tourists know about it so there's never really a wait! I've been there during peak hours (fri/sat night) and never waited longer than 5 minutes.  I personally found this place from a poker player who lives in vegas, so try it out! everyone who knows about it is a regular.",

    "text": "I know I'm writing this review kind of late. But every time  we come to Vegas we make it a priority to stop at this place. The first time we came to this restaurant was summer 2010, on a fluke as of there was a bank and a grocery store right by there. So as we ran into the bank and the store real quick we decided to grab a bite to eat , the all you can eat sushi sign attracted us so all of us ordered it. I wasn't really expecting much from an \"all you can eat sushi\" spot but let me tell you that place is the s*it!! The rolls are sooo delicious, my fav ones are the wet dream and the man whore rolls! and the seafood salad was the bizness (super good lol), one of the best salads I've ever had, I literally wanted to drink the dressing. Now you dont have to get the all you can eat special, you can always order seperate dishes as well, but youll be missing out. The second time we came to Vegas summer 2011 we had came to this restaurant on 2 separate days. We couldn't get enough of this place. We were celebrating my 24th bday that weekend  and some of the girls I was with had mentioned it to the waitress. I really didn't think they were going to do anything special for me but soon after they had told her they brought out a mochi cake with candles and the whole waitressing staff sung happy bday to me. They made me feel so special and loved. Soon after that the owner came out and chatted with us a bit, in my eyes this restaurant can do no wrong! Excellent food, great service.. Overall very good experience , jus wished they had one in San Diego!",

The quality of fish was good (not great), but the cuts were ok and holy moly rice... I felt like I was eating starch for days.. I couldn't even taste the fish cuz there's so much rice!! They're a bit understaff so it takes a while to order and for your food to come. The Mexican lady is also a bit rude when you ask her about things on the menu. I think if more people know about Sakana across the street they would not be so busy. Sorry Yama, think Sakana's got you beat in quality and variety.",

I just want to say i personally label myself as a all you can eat sushi guru. my friends and i work for the airlines so its a 1 hour free flight to las vegas and las vegas seem to have the most all you can eat sushi bars.  I was by myself and which is customary for me before i bring the whole gang. I sat at the bar.  Service: the waitresses were friendly and attentive. Now the sushi chef was okay i dont blame him but you dont know who's gonna be the big tipper. there was an attractive young lady at the bar before i got there he was very attentive to her but a little slow and no rec commendations which he offered her.  i got two menus one with specialty rolls- basically all spicy tuna concoction , california roll stuff and fried shrimp stuff. thats all i saw nothing special. now the other menu had traditional nigiri and regular rolls you would finds just about anywhere with a list of appetizers.  1. i started out with a spicy tuna roll with eel on top, the roll size was perfect. the spicy tuna was a little fishy and the eel was not very buttery and little fishy also. after that i thought i'd try the nigiri sushi and see if anything stands out.  1. halibut was decent but the texture on the rice of the nigiri sushi was a little bit hard. 2. giant clam decent 3. sweet shrimp i could tell it was just thawed 4. two orders of garlic tuna decent cause of the sauce 5. two orders of salmon fresh, they were advertising this on a sign as i walked in on a little side walk sign. 6. ika --not fresh 7. taco very dry 8. seaweed salad decent  9. miso soup salty for my taste and came out lukewarm 10 finished with green tea ice cream, cant go wrong with ice cream i think this was the best part of the meal.  it was cheap and worth a try, it had few strikes when i walked it. First I'm korean nothing against my peeps but most sushi bars owned by koreans in my experience are skimpy on the fish and the texture of the rice for some reason is never any good. this place is korean owned. Second when i walked in i was the only asian customer beside the workers.   Too bad sushi house manda closed cause of the smoking law it was in a bar, that place was good. Also Koto was very good but they went out of business i dont know why it was a great restaurant which should have charged more.  I will keep searching las vegas for the best all you can eat sushi bar. Let everybody know. by the way i had gone to Oshyi La's week that way better that yama.",

All of the rolls were delish,  but one stood out above the rest and that was the BE MINE, made with salmon, cream cheese, crab salad, and fried in tempura batter.

The rolls are very innovative, and the names paired with them are just as creative. The rolls are awesomely fresh, and you will NOT go wrong with this place. Only thing I'm sad about is that I'd have to drive 300 miles just to come here again, they need to expand into LA!  The roll (which I forgot the name) that consists of salmon, cucumber, and lemon (essentially a california roll with the fixings) is amazingly refreshing, and one of my favorites. Their appetizers are well prepared as well. The tofu agadashi was fried perfectly, and the agadashi had the perfect tang to its sweetness. My friends went ape wild over the seafood salad. And if that doesnt get you, then the AYCE mochi ice cream probably will.   Great service, great food, great place to go for a date or group event. 23 bucks for all that is honestly a dream come True.

A friend of friend who lives out in Vegas took us out to this place.  We had soo much sushi!  All you can eat (dinner=23.95) and a Sapporo.  The service is awesome and our waiter, Stephen was hilarious!  They were super nice and super quick with our food.  For dessert we munched on chocolate & strawberry mochi ice cream and red bean ice cream.  BOMB DIGGITY!!!!  Ever in Vegas?  Hit this place up for a nice meal before you the strip.",

    "text": "Where to begin?? This is my FAVORITE sushi joint EVER! I happily make the drive from Summerlin to Yama every chance I get!  The prices are very reasonable compared to most sushi places!! (At Yama, my son and I can eat AYCE dinner for just under $50 leaving plenty of cash for tips!  The last place I took him too, cost us $75 BEFORE tip.. and it was AYCE too, but most stuff wasn't included, but you'll read about that in their review later. =)  *Now, about the food: ALWAYS fresh, never fishy, and they always customize it for your tastes! I go about once every other month or so, but the chefs still remember me, and keep the Crazy red chili sauce to themselves. So that speaks great for their service too and ensures the food is how I like it every time. Another reviewer mentioned the Baked Green Mussels- Those are a MUST on every trip! They have the best mussels EVER!  Like they have their own way of making it that sets theirs apart from every where else. Also, their Man Whore, Son of a Beach and Harry Potter rolls are to die for! Plus, I love that you can order half rolls!  So if you just want to try a roll, or if you want to be able to maximize the amount of choices you get without stuffing yourself sick, you can half roll it all day long! lol. The Chicken Yakitori and Teriyaki is delicious too! And this is perhaps the only joint in town where you can have as much mochi and ice cream as you want  *ABOUT THE AYCE: Ok, I noticed some people commented that you will be charged for what you don't eat- that is semi True here, but True for ALL AYCE sushi joints. All AYCE joints have the time limit/no waste signs, and some even have the No mochi with AYCE sign too! And I understand why- You don't want some one ordering 15 rolls, eating 2 bites of each and wasting the rest. It totally makes sense to me. The difference with Yama is- If you tried it and it just totally didn't suit your taste buds, tell them and they will take it back. If you make an honest effort to eat the whole roll but have a few pieces left, they won't care. The only time they have ever said anything to my friends or myself, was when we have about 15 pieces of various rolls laying around. Plus Yama DOESN'T have a time limit, nor a food quantity limit like some places. If you want 30 pieces of Mochi, then bring on the Ice Cream Headache! Again, The AYCE rules makes total sense.  *The service: They are freaking awesome! I see some people talking about wait. They must be going at 7pm on a Friday or Saturday, and you'll experience long waits at those times anywhere you go. I usually have a party of 4 with me when ever I go, and we are usually seated within minutes.  The chefs remember our choices and have even created special rolls just for us when we go in! And if you don't like their experiment they made for you, not a problem! They aren't offended, and they don't charge you for it. You can flag down any waitress, they aren't territorial in any way. nor are they judgmental - Sure they giggle when my 11 year old son orders one of every flavor of mochi plus a green tea and plum ice cream, but they deliver it to him none the less!  After all, it's me that has to deal with his sugar high later, right? lol  *Over All* This is a great restaurant! If you had a less than perfect experience the first time, it was just a fluke and you should give them a second chance! And regardless of what any one says, The Crazy Red Chili sauce is the work of the Devil. =)",

    "text": "For the longest time me and a friend have planned to have sushi together and finally one day after months of waiting we made it official at Yama Sushi. She loves Yama Sushi, but unfortunately I can't say the same. I've been to Yama one time previously, but the visit was mediocre and easily forgotten. My latest visit was certainly disappointing.   Yama's prices for AYCE is a little cheaper than most places in vegas at $20/lunch and $23/dinner. If you're not ordering AYCE then you should expect most rolls to cost you anywhere from $3 (vegetable roll) to $14.   Lets talk about the grubbb. I ordered three different nigiri which were salmon, tuna, and yellow tail. All three each were fat slices of dry fish and smelled fishy. The tuna was especially rubbery and I am ashamed to say I had to drench it in soy sauce to finish it. However the rolls were decent, maybe because of the sauces hiding the poor quality fish. My \"I love salmon roll\" had a good portion brown avocado, but I guess what can you do it is AYCE. The rolls off the special menu (the rolls with sexual names i.e man whore) were very presentable. If I were to visit again I would definitely skip the nigiri and go for the special menu items. Desserts are AYCE as well, not limited to one like other places. AYCE mochi ice cream yay, but for some odd reason my plum ice cream was really foamy.  Now to the quirky service.  Short version: quirky and confusing servers. Long wait time, forgot orders, payment problems and miscommunication.    Brace yourself for story time.   My waitress that day was all sorts of weird. When my missing party members came she asked them what they wanted to drink, but in a rude tone. Uh... okay maybe thats her natural tone. Next was the ordering issues. I tell her about 5 things that I would like to order (2 orders of salmon, tuna, yellow tail nigiri, 1 seaweed salad, and a I Love Salmon roll) and then she moves onto the next person, but wait she then tells me I can only order two items at a time. What the.. okay maybe they want to protect me from wasting food. So she then ask me if I want my nigiri first or my roll. I tell her I want my nigiri first and she confirms it with me, alright cool. My first order was my roll, what the heck, thats no problem since I still wanted the roll.. but why even bother asking me if you're not going to follow through. My friend whom ordered halibut nigiri and a roll did not get his order for atleast 15 minutes, and when it came, it was just the roll. He confirmed with her if his nigiri was still coming and she checks with the chef, \"it will be just a moment\".  It never comes, he gives up, and just orders something else. My other friend did not receive his cucumber roll for at least another 10 minutes after my second order. When it came time to paying we split the check, one with two AYCE (mine) and the other with two AYCE and one drink. We specifically pointed to the credit card that is getting the two AYCE and a drink. For some reason they charged me two AYCE and two drinks, not a big price difference or anything... but what the heck, we POINTED out which card.   Argggh horrible service is a real killer for me, perhaps their staff were all newbies that day, all I know is they need to get it together.",

My friends and I stumbled upon this place one pre-clubbing night in Vegas and we make it a point to visit here everytime we're in Vegas -it's a must on our list.  The food is delicious @ really great AYCE prices. Seriously, NOTHING is bad here. From the salad to the soup to everything, it's just absolutely delicious. Sometimes I get the urge to move here just so I can come here more often.  The service is perfect. It's really cozy and small- usually there's a wait.

It's very small in there so you might be all squished together but I prefer that to waiting a long time just to get a table. The waiters have a good sense of humor and egg you on to order more.   The rolls/sushi are creative and they also have the standard ones if that's what you want. We tried a handful of the salads/appetizers and rolls - hilarious names like one minute man, happy endings, baby hit me one more time - all good. Mochi ice cream for dessert is always good.",

The all-you-can-eat sushi ends at 10:30, so we got there just in time to enjoy the sushi before they cut it off.   We sat at the bar, so we always had super fast service with sushi. The sushi chef was funny and made great rolls.  Between my friend and I, we pretty much tried most of what was on the menu, and most of it was really good.  The rolls are on the smaller side, which was kind of nice because you dont have to eat a ton if you dont like it, and you get to try more rolls.  The rolls are creative and have funny names like \"wet dream\" roll and \"one minute man\" roll.  The fish quality is pretty good, and all seemed fresh.   Another plus, is that you can order anything on the menu.  Soup, salad, tempura, gyoza, you name it...you can order it.  Mochi Ice cream is even included! Bonus points!!   Id have to say that this isnt the best sushi I've had, but for an all-you-can-eat place, its definitely on my list of places to go again.",

They aren't the best anymore anyway,  we have found that sushi mon, and daisho sushi are both consistantly better and have higher quality and better service. The only reason we went to yama again is because they're closer to our home.  Not anymore. It's not worth it when they consistently ruin our meals with their poor service.  Last time we had to ask for a new table because they tried to stuff 6 adults and a high chair at a 4 person table and set a plate of silverware including knives directly in front of our 2 yr old, which he picked up, of course. Then they put wasabi right in front of him. It was like pulling teeth to get them to give us a new table and we had to speak to the mgr to get it. Time before that, our server was the rudest person I ran in to all year. And this time the server came and rudely told my husband he needed to take his foot off of the chair because a customer complained, when we asked for the mgr we were told they were out of town. It was the equivalent of the server telling you to take your elbows off the table. And it was lunch. Plus they kept running into my chair the whole time I was eating, now that's rude. That's it, we're done. We used to put up with their crap service bc their food was so good, unfortunately their food isn't great anymore so it's just not remotely worth it. We will just go farther now to somewhere cheaper that has better food and service. Yama, we're over!",

Their food is pretty good. Their selection of special rolls is pretty unique. Their Palm Job is amazing! Their roll names are a bit amusing but you have to have a sense of humor.   The servers and sushi chefs are hit or miss. Sometimes your water is overflowing and sometimes your slurping the last drops of your melted ice for 10 minutes. Also, the sushi chefs have a horrible habit of ignoring you if they are in the middle of doing a service order, even if you stare right at them. Normally I am pretty patient when it comes to ordering at the bar, however a simple \"I'll be right with you\" would be plenty.  On the plus side, they have a great AYCE price, which more than pays for itself when you add up the individual roll prices. They also will make you half rolls too, which is my favorite. This way I can try a whole bunch of rolls without filling myself up. They do tend to cover their rolls in a good amount of sauce so if this turns you off, make sure to ask for it on the side.   All in all, I do go back to Yama, but not as often as I used to. Step up the service guys!",

Before my last visit this would have been 5 stars. Unfortunately after my last visit just for stars. My only real complaint is the speed of the food coming out. Sometimes it take longer than I feel it should. Might just be me. If you are eating all you can eat sushi you might realize that after 20 minutes that rice will explode in your stomach. Then that is all you can eat. I love this place and usually leave saying why do a stuff my stomach so much. Only to make a trip back the next time I am in town. The variety and the freshness of the sushi here is among the best. Get of the strip and get over to Yama Sushi. .",

    "text": "Another AYCE sushi place in Vegas, priced similarly to the other places around town.    The sushi tastes a little better than the other places I've been to around town, but not really exceptional or distinctive.  It's a bit crowded and frenetic inside, not really a place to find your Zen moment.  The service was bizarrely aggressive - I could have easily confused the place for a stock trading pit from the way they furiously cleared plates and ripped/re-placed the menu on the table.  I did like their plum ice cream at the end, a rare find I've been told.  Question: why do sushi places around here name their rolls with sexual innuendos?  Sex and sushi, hmm....",

Great location: near the strip, and UNLV campus with plenty of parking. This place was really packed when I went. Their staff was very attentive. However, their fish does not taste very fresh (I know, I know, its the middle of the desert right?), not only having not so tasty fish, I felt that every roll was just covered in spicy mayo. Don't get me wrong. I LOVVVVEEEE SPICY MAYO, and I welcome it on most rolls. But at Yama, every roll tasted the same due to the overwhelming taste of spicy mayo. So eating there I was left with two choices. Try and ignore the fishy taste of the real sushi, or fill myself up with mayo rolls . From now on I will make the extra drive over to Oyishi for AYCE.",

We tried 8 rolls, and they fell in two categories: bland or sickly sweet. The fish itself was ok, and the sushi chefs knocked the rolls out pretty fast, so I'll be generous and give it two stars. $70 bucks for two with drinks / tax / tip ? Not even remotely worth it.",

Still, overall a great experience. Also, the half roll option is a GREAT option. It lets you try a little of everything and still have room for seconds of your favorites. We WILL be back for sure. We'll just order more rolls and order more before the first round is gone to decrease the wait time!",

    "text": "Yama to me, means YUMMY!!! Yummy Sushi!! You have a choice for a la carte or all you can eat. Now if you love sushi as much as I do, Go for the All you can eat! There is no specific time limit like what we have here in the San Fernando Valley. When you look at the menu, look for the one with the * (asterisk sign) those are limited orders per person. Sadly, they limit you on mochi!!! i love mochi!! thats a bit weird since my friend natalie has a dog named mochi!! :/ well anyways, the first time we had came here was in 2012 and I wasn't sure if my family would come here again. However, in 2013 we came here for our Christmas Eve dinner. What can you say about that? Now, what to order? For me.. I am huge on sushi. I will order the sushi first which is tamago(egg), Salmon, Masago, Eel (Unagi), Sweet Shrimp (now this is a treat, because they are limited orders but the head of the shrimp is HUGE and edible and fried). As for drinks, I prefer you order water. Don't drink any drinks that much because the rice will expand and you will definitely get full easily. A favorite for my dad and some of you who have family members, friends who can't tolerate fish... well you can order beef, pork cutlets, chicken, etc. Now, for the main thing to order! is the seafood salad. They put in all different sashimi (tuna, salmon, albacore) into a salad. OMG this is for sure the best appetizer on the menu. So, come on, take a chance on this sushi place. The wait times aren't as bad, since it's off the strip. If you live in Las Vegas or California, definitely check out my blog at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftastypalateandfoodie.blogspot.com&s=9e666caa8c5b7ca67f161d1fcf0d9de72e135c6625a977e9a98eb9670d4c801d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tastypalateandfoodie.blo...</a>",

Some lady brought over 2 plates that weren't ours. Got our sushi and attempted to get a refill of my drink, never happened. Placed a to go order and asked for check, took another 15 minutes after seeing the box of sushi sitting at counter. Server looked over at table nodded to someone else and was never brought over.

I'll say right off the bat that the 5th star is because they actually will bring you all the necessary accoutrements (including extra napkins) when you, or 7 of you, want to do sake bombs. Legit. And they are always smiling. I love when people like what they do.   You really can't beat their all you can eat for $23.99 (I think). I am really not a sushi snob, but I know what I like and don't like as far as sushi goes and I love their specialty rolls. I am usually not big on cream cheese in a roll, kinda weird to me, but #17 the Man Whore is delicious. I also always get the #3 TNT roll and the #6 You The Man Too. Not to mention all you can eat is always the best deal for sashimi and theirs is definitely fresh. Secret: you can leave some of the rice on the plate from your sashimi and they won't have a conniption fit.   And yes, it really is in that crappy shopping center. But once you're inside and you see the awesome lighted mural on the sushi bar wall you'll forget about it :)",

    "text": "We love sushi.  Twenty or more years ago long before sushi bars dotted the valley or even the nation, my well traveled brother introduced me to raw fish and it was love at first bite!  At the time I was introduced sushi consisted of very 'plain' sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi.  At least at the time of my introduction I didn't find lots of sauces and specialty rolls.  I learned to love the fish.  All these years later, that is what I like best about Yama- the fish.  I have eaten at Yama countless times over the last ten years and I have never been disappointed.  Sure, some times are better than others but all in all it is the best sushi place I have found in Las Vegas.",

They start you off with a \"Seafood Salad\"--there's no lettuce around, just generous chunks of salmon and tuna, with deep-fried shrimp in a spicy rice-vinegar dressing on top a bed of noodles. I could've just had that and been blissful, but then came the rolls...rolls upon rolls!  So, to clarify something: when you think 'all-you-can-eat' sushi, don't think of a buffet, because it's not that; it is roll-by-roll, order what you want but eat what you order. The bigger the group, the more you can try and the easier it is to finish the rolls.   My family is a bunch of foodies; there were 2 chefs in our group, to boot, and all of us were impressed with the quality of the dishes.   This is now a mandatory stop for me in Las Vegas, and if you eat sushi anywhere else, you are missing out.",

    "text": "I was trying to come here last year with some of my colleagues from out of country but they were too impatient to wait and went to the place next door which we regretted big time.  Anyways we came here Sunday May 4th around lunch time ending the weekend for my cousin's 21st birthday bash.  It happened that he found this restaurant using the Yelp app and I remembered that I tried coming here before.  I knew it must have been a good Sushi spot since there was a line outside the door when we tried coming during dinner last time.  There were 6 of us and the hostess was quick to get us seated even though the place looked pretty packed but no line outside the door this time.  They ended up seating us on the left side near the front.  It kinda looked like a mini room and there were 2 sets of tables in that little area enough to sit the 6 of us and these cute Korean ladies on the next table.  There was 1 small TV in there..it was playing Inception and I remember another TV in the larger dining area airing the basketball game.  I didn't get to see the other room since this is our first time being in there.  Our waitress' name was Ellen I believe.  She was quite the comedian.  She was quick to give us the popular rolls and side orders.  The name of the special rolls are hilarious...One Minute Man, Man Whore, Wet Dream, Son of the Beach, Happy Ending,   I freakin love the names.  We decided to do A.Y.C.E. just as the ladies did next to us....my brother asked them that's how we knew.  We ordered the Sashimi Salad for an appetizer.  I would recommend that to anyone.  There was almost 0 greens in that salad.  It was mostly just the sashimi and the special Yama sauce that they wouldn't sell to us even if we begged them to.  We ended up ordering 4 more orders later on of that deliciousness.  We also had the special rolls I mentioned above and some nigiri as well.  Uni was nice and fresh.  We'll definitely hit this spot up again and again when we come to Vegas.  Only thing I regret is not opening my mouth when the ladies next to us talked about visiting San Diego soon...lol.",

I can say not worth the wait only because the back half of the restraunt had no AC and in Vegas summer that was a no go. I will say the all you can eat was priced well and all the sushi was delicious. They accommodated us with discount do to the no AC issue. The service was quick from order to eat time. The staff was very professional and friendly considering the no AC and having full capacity crowd.",

On the bright side, Yama sushi's service is well; however, the sushi is garbage and is overstuffed with rice. Go ahead and see yourself that it is way too much. I do admit the wet dream roll tastes amazing, otherwise everything else, especially their nigiri; I ordered salmon and super white tuna, taste like it had been DRENCHED in TAP water. The shrimp tempura appetizers I ordered weren't even crunchy compared to most I've tried from other restaurants. It was as if it was microwaved cold.",

One of them is the seafood salad.  Get it! Then get whatever rolls you like....then get another...and another, etc. You absolutely can't beat this price for all you can eat.  Plus it is great sushi, not like some buffet crap. If you would normally eat 2 rolls, you're already over the all you can eat price so just get it and pig the hell out. 2 Japanese beers and many Sojus on hand. Also have U.S. beers.

    "text": "Yama Sushi is great for AYCE! The price for lunch and dinner are both reasonable. The quality of fish is quite good for AYCE. And I give it an A for service and friendly staff. The menu selection is awesome. The only thing that really bothered me was the huge amount of rice that came with the nigiri sushi. I had to fight the urge to get up, climb over to the other side of the sushi bar and snatch all the huge balls of rice away from the sushi chefs.   The seafood salad here is great and I highly recommend it. If you don't want to fill up on rice, start with this. It is a larger portion of pieces of fish and I like to get it with a mild spicy sauce. It is way better than some of the pathetic little bowl of poki salad with 3 minuscule pieces of tuna (I'm looking at you, Goyemon!).   I like that the menu also offers hamachi kama and salmon kama but sadly when I was there, they ran out of hamachi. I had the salmon and it was delicious. I think their nigiri sushi can be a hit or miss. For the most part, it was good. I love white tuna. Uni that day wasn't so good. Giant calm couldn't be more ironic as I had to squint to see it. The Ika was probably the saddest looking thing, super tiny on a huge bed of rice.   I'm more of a sashimi and nigiri sushi type but did sample 2 of their specialty rolls. I tried the spicy sexy roll and surprisingly ended up eating half of the roll. It was really good and indeed spicy. The other one I tried is the Ellen roll. It's good but not as flavorful and a bit too heavy for me. Only good for a piece or two.   I like that their staff is so incredibly friendly and super attentive. I've never seen so many people check up on us this often, especially since the place was super packed. Whatever you need is brought to you super fast. Now that is good service.",

It isn't so tiny anymore, but it is still just as busy.    The quality of food has changed a bit since I've been going here.  I notice that they put more rice in the nigiri & sushi.  It bums me out when I take a bite and all I taste is rice...  That's my only gripe about this place.  I love their appetizers though, soft shelled crab and spicy seafood salad is a must every time.  My favorite rolls are Sun of the Beach, No Name, and Wet Dream.  They've also changed their desert limit to ONE mochi per person.   Service here has always been spot on for me.  They are very attentive and the food comes out in a timely manner.  My glass is always filled and they always come up to check on the table every couple of minutes.  It's the best service I've had at a sushi restaurant!   They're also probably one of the cheapest places for AYCE (dinner is $23.95).    ** next time ask for your favorite nigiri \"sexy.\"  They add a thin slice of lemon and jalapeno to it.  I love sexy salmon nigiri!",

Once again, our fellow Yelpers helped us out and didn't fail to direct us to a good place to eat! For a Friday night, the wait seemed to be pretty typical - 30-45 mins. It was definitely worth it as our party of three was seated right at the sushi station. The sushi chefs in the back room (failed to get their names) gave us personalized attention and served up some awesome sushi! I recommend the My Cash, Double Dragon, and Strip Tease of you're a big specialty roll person. The seafood salad and sexy salmon are also secret gems on the menu.  The space in the restaurant was a little cramped which is probably the only drawback. This will probably be added to the AYCE list for future visits to Vegas.",

You can't miss it.  2. plenty of parking.  3. They have an all you can eat dinner for $23.99/pp dinner and $20.99/pp lunch. Dinner starts at 3pm.  review:  1. The seating was awkward and very tight. The 2 person tables are seated right next to each other and you can hear conversations from both sides of the table.   2. The sushi was just plain, very bland. There was no taste.  3. My philadelphia roll had SOO much cream cheese it was disgusting. I'll upload a picture..  This place is affordable, but the food and the inside seating sucked so much I'm not sure why people leave such good reviews.  I would highly recommend Blue Fin Sushi & Roll a few miles away, MUCH better sushi and atmosphere, and it's about the same price. We hit that location on our date night before going to the Galaxy theater which has reclinable seats.  I would not recommend this place at all, bad sushi and cramped seating.",

I live in Boston (near the Asian suburbia here) and have a big Chinese / Japanese selection here. I know how hard it is to find a staple good sushi joint. We went to Yama 2 times during our 3 day stay and it was worth it.   Also - try to sit at the bar. The chefs are very friendly. Especially BON. He made a special roll for us wrapped in a Nori sheet. Bon, hope to see you next time we visit Vegas. We will have saki shots with you if I am not driving. Cheers!!",

Sushi names are very funny...one minute man, sun of the beach, strip tease, happy ending, etc. Good rice-to-fish ratio.  This place is always busy nomatter what time you come here. I'm partially to blame because whenever I have people from out-of-town come to Vegas, I always take them/ tell them about this place. Some servers do seem to get impatient with noobs so know what you want and pick 2 rolls to start of with.",

Sat at the sushi bar and it extremely quick service by the chef . They make it to order right in front of you! Kinda neat watchin them whip up everyones food so quick and efficient . We went on a saturday night so we had to wait about 15 mins for 2 of us.. Larger parties had to wait longer that were there ahead of us.. Food was excellent and i thought the price was good. Cheaper if you go before 3 pm.   Go in hungry! You won't regret it! Oh yea practice using chopsticks because we did not see a fork anywhere!",

The sushi was fresh, delicious, and well made. The menu is vast and contains the traditional staples as well as some new specials and a ton of variety! My personal favorite was the 007 roll.

If you are with a party of two or three the sushi bar is most likely to come available more quickly. Because it is so busy, service suffers as they are overwhelmed and understaffed. Most waitresses/waiters (except the two brothers) are hard to understand. You might want to check up on orders after some time has passed, as in previous visits they have forgotten to put in my order.   This isn't my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in town but I do not have have anything against it and would put it in my top 6 AYCE sushi restaurants in town. The fish isn't as fresh but paying $21 for AYCE lunch and $27 for AYCE dinner, you get what you are paying for.   *If you like Yama, you will love Sushi Goyemon! (Try it out)*",

I love sushi, so much so that I've made several attempts to make it at home (sort of successful but still needs work). Unfortunately, for the life of me I can not match how good the sushi is at Yama.   Yama was the first place I tried AYCE which if I had known about sooner I would probably weigh quite a bit more. The trick is to tread slowly, get only 2 rolls at a time if your sharing with someone else, or you might end up being full too quick and get yourself into sushi trouble (speaking from personal experience). Now, that I've been to Yama I know how to order without screwing myself over on the AYCE.   I love all the dirty names of their specialty rolls, makes eating even more fun and a little naughty if you're on a date. I especially love the roll, Wet Dream. It's so good. I highly recommend it. Oh, and the newer roll, Ellen roll, that is also so delicious.  In fact those two rolls are the main things are start thinking about once I start craving sushi.   If you like sushi and love good service and quality then definitely try Yama Sushi.   The place is very busy especially in the evenings but they recently renovated and gave themselves more room (helps a lot). Also, if you want a cheaper price you can always aim for a sushi lunch.",

On my last visit, my friends and I ordered the Manwhore, the spicy salmon roll (forget the name), chicken teriyaki, and a few maki rolls.  All were served fairly quickly and the rolls looked fairly fresh, not too much rice and a decent amount of fish.    The AYCE deal is probably a great one for those with bottomless pits for stomachs.  I'd love to do that, but alas!, I have a limited capacity in my tummy.    A solid place for one's sushi craving.",

    "text": "I stopped in for a late lunch thinking I'd get two specialty rolls, but at $20.95 for AYCE it was cheaper to go that route.  I ended up getting 2 1/2 rolls, seaweed salad, shrimp tempura, and finished up with miso soup.  Everything was excellent, especially the Double Dragon Roll.  The first two rolls were made surprisingly quick, maybe because it was after the normal lunch crush.  The waiter and waitress were attentive, refilling my water several times, and asking if I needed anything else.  Two chef's behind the bar were also good about asking if there was anything else I'd like. But when I was finished and wanted to ask for the check, I suddenly became invisible and waited for about 15 minutes, before finally just leaving cash on the counter and walking out.  Until then, everything was perfect.  This was my third visit, and the food is always very good.",

There was even a point in time where I was too cheap to take the taxi from the strip and took the bus to this place instead which I do not recommend over the summer when it was scalding hot. Around NYE, I brought my brother and cousins here and we all enjoyed our food. Everyone was specially raving about their seafood salad! Yummy!!  The complaint my company had is that the sushi comes one by one and not all at once which is also a good thing because it ensures that the sushi is fresh and so we don't get full too fast. We were nearing our 2-hour limit so we had to stuff our faces on the last 20 minutes.   FYI: their AYCE includes EVERYTHING on the menu unlike other AYCE places where you are limited to just their sushi.   I will come back again Sushi Yama! Until then!",

    "text": "Hmmm. Almost 300 reviews on this place and the reviews seem to be fairly consistent 4 and 5 star reviews. Which leads me to believe that either I ate here on an 'off' night, or else there are alot of people out there who have never eaten really good sushi.  This is apparently a local spot. Located only 5 minutes from the The Strip, but in a nondescript strip mall that you would never think to look in, unless you were coming here. Must have waited for a good 20 minutes to get in the door; there was a long line of people at 8pm on a Friday night.  Very low-key, casual environment. No interior design to speak of. You are coming here for the prices. They have a $23 all-you-can-eat dinner special that some friends recommended, so we went with it.  In terms of selection, Yama Sushi has that in abundance. At least 25 specialty rolls, and then all of your typical rolls and sushi, etc.  My issue with this place isn't that it's actually bad - it's not. It's just not particularly good either. The rice was soggy and sticky. The fish portions are really tiny. And the taste of the fish gets easily drowned out by the soggy, sticky rice. The edamame was actually bad. Miso soup was blah. And honestly, $23/each comes out to over $50/couple which, I've been to  many mid-range sushi places with comparable prices that offered better food, if not the selection that Yama Sushi offers.  The service was also sub-par. Many items were ordered that never came out of the kitchen. Had to request a tea refill four times before the refill came. When we were wrapping up our meal, the server essentially made it clear that it was now time for us to leave.  For my money, I would find somewhere else. And you can trust me; I'm an Elite. ;)",

    "text": "Yeah! Jackpot!! I know where I'm going every time I hit Las Vegas from now on!  Having recently become addicted to sushi, I hopped on Yelp after arriving in Las Vegas to find where the good sushi places around there are.  I wasn't necessarily looking for high class sushi bars at the hotels, but just good sushi in general, even if it was off the beaten path a little bit.  Well, with all these good reviews for Yama Sushi, how could we not try it!  The drive wasn't too far off the strip, and I enjoy seeing other areas of Las Vegas so that's a bonus for me.  Yama Sushi was located in a shopping center, it was a small sushi dive and we were lucky as we didn't have to wait for a table.  (And this, from what I read and hear, is a rare occasion ... usually there is a wait for Yama Sushi, especially during peak sushi hours, such as lunch time and evening time).  Anyway, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who sat us down at the table.  Having been burned by not so good AYCE deals before, we decided to order a couple of rolls from the menu instead.  (Next time we'll probably go for the AYCE). Our waiter was very friendly and funny,  and I do see a couple of reviews here that complain about the service, but I don't have any complaints in that department at all.    For starters, I ordered \"Sun on a beach\", it had eel, tempura shrimp and avocado on the inside and salmon on top, drizzled with eel sauce!! Hands down, one of the best rolls I've ever had.  I've even started asking my regular sushi place where I live to make this roll for me,  I just love it! My husband got a spicy roll, I believe it may have been \"Who's your daddy\", and he really loved it as well.  Once we were done, we agreed we could fit one more roll, so we ordered one that had tempura squid in it.  I can't for the life of me remember the name! But it was delicious! :)  Unfortunately we didn't make it to dessert, but we will next time.  This will definitely become a \"must-stop\" place every time we visit Las Vegas! :)  Taste, freshness, creativity... even comedy! This sushi joint has it all.  I'm giving 5 stars.",

For a Monday night this place was full, which was a good sign of tasty things to come.  The wait was quoted at 25 minutes, but it took only 10 to get seated.  Although the all you can eat sushi was tempting, we weren't starving and opted to have 2 special rolls that weren't part of the ayce menu and an appetizer.  I highly recommend ordering the Sun of the Beach roll.  Another highlight was the staff, which was really friendly and attentive during our meal.   I also have a basis that separates good service from great service, which was the refilling of our drinks.  Our cups never went below the halfway mark, which is a bold statement but 100% True.

Although their selection of appetizers and sides were minimal, the sushi was great.  we were able to try more than just 2 - 3 rolls for a table of two because the pieces were more bite-sized. The best part is that most rolls come in half order! so you did not have to wait until you were almost finished to get half rolls.  excellent addition to their AYCE menu.   Things i like: Soft Shell Crab Roll Harry Potter Roll (simply for the name) Seafood Salad (i think thats the name, cubes of fresh fish, radish and a nice sauce) Tempura Dancing in the Sheet Red Bean Ice Cream Iced Green Tea  Didn't like Hawaiian Roll (just tuna, spicy tuna and a cucumber piece with rice, needed sauce or avocado) Firecracker (almost a raw piece of jalapeno with tuna stuffing, but the jalapeno was too hard to eat) No orgasm type dish or sashimi as a part of AYCE?  maybe, but i didn't see it  For a weeknight the place was definitely packed, but these servers are so fast and attentive, I couldn't even tell.  and i didn't have to ask for anything.  I won't go here willingly as my first choice as I am a loyal sushi diner elsewhere, BUT if i were invited to go here again, i will definitely be saying yes.",

It did fill up rather quickly after that and at one point a room divider almost fell on me. But after experiencing Yama Sushi I really can't imagine going anywhere else!  The price is more then fair for AYCE and the entire menu is fair game.  The standouts for me were the seafood salad, Yama roll, superman, wet dream.... seriously everything was good!  I can't wait to go back.   Not to mention the servers are very attentive.  Water always refilled, plates taken away quickly and always ready for our next order.",

    "text": "Not sure if it's the day we came (Wednesday afternoon) but the quality of the food was not the same since last time I came. We always come and dine here when we are in town, which has been our tradition since 2011. The reason we fell in love with Yama is because their sushi was quality sushi all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.   But this recent visit I can tell that they are going towards the route of saving money and buying low quality products. The shrimp was bland and when I chewed it tasted like water. Most of the rolls with cream cheese that I ordered had a lot of cream cheese and very little crab meat. I'm not sure what's going on. The sushi rolls were not the same, in taste like the ones we love (Striptease, One Minute Man) it's truly heart breaking. I probably won't come back, solely because the food was pretty disgusting comparing it to our previous experiences. We lastly ordered strawberry Mochi which in my mind can't ever be done wrong. To my surprise I bit into it and it was grainy, not eatable at all. Total waste of my money to be honest. I currently have a stomach ate.    I'm hoping this is just a one time experience, but if they are \"maximizing profits\" by going down in quality. Avoid it!!!!",

I have no idea what is in them but it appears that they prepare some sort of filling in rice rolls ahead of time and then add a few things on top before serving. Whatever is in the rolls, I got the same roll three times with a few different \"toppings\". A unique approach to sushi (but a horrible one). The taste of the roll was... Nondescript. I really could not tell you anything other than that the rice was of poor quality and did not taste fresh. As for what was inside, some sort of mystery ground paste. Hum.  I did order Unagi, and that was the only thing I saw that looked like normal sushi. It was just okay. I will definitely not be back.   One final thing. Why did I go to an all you can eat sushi place you might ask?  Business obligation where I had no choice.",

Advise that you go sit at the bar, you'll get to see the sushi chefs in action.  For the sushi, the salmon, ahi, giant clam, salmon roe, and flying fish eggs are all good.  The spicy seafood salad was not bad either.  I could never get used to the way spicy tuna is made in Vegas compared to how it's done in Hawaii.  Must visit here again on my next trip to Vegas!

But then I saw the Sushi chef start throwing pieces of fish from the fridge on to his cutting board. In the process I saw him drop a piece of squid on to the floor. After he finished throwing the rest of the fish on to the cutting board he thought he was being slick and picked up that piece of squid walked over to the sink and started rinsing it off...... but I saw him do that, he turned around and we locked eyes and he knew that I caught him being shady. He quickly returned to rinsing off the fish and quickly threw it back into a bin inside the fridge. And then he quickly beelined it into the kitchen.  Gross. This all happened as I was on my way out of the restaurant. I'm hoping that didn't happen to any of my fish or your fish for that matter.",

I found it interesting that not one server was assigned to our table. We ordered from several different servers, and each time, our rolls came out super fast.

Except when it came out, it was baked, warm, and had a bunch of different kinds of fish and stuff that do not typically come on a California roll - so we failed there too.  The all you can eat concept is great, except for every roll you do not eat, you get charged the full price of the roll you abandoned.

But that didn't stop them from forgetting some of our orders even though we asked repeatedly where it was.

I feel like a lot of AYCE places try to slow you down by not checking on you often. Here, however, we were usually the ones not ready to reorder as our waiter kept coming around to see if we wanted more items. They were also very good about refilling the soda and water. Despite the fact that they always have a line, you never feel like they are rushing you out and I appreciate that.   I've heard so many good things about them , but they were always so busy that I didn't get to eat here. I'm glad we came for a few birthday celebrations and I can say I agree with the majority of the reviews that say it's worth the wait!",

It also has a   Fried muscles: you can just never go wrong with this.  All of the special rolls kind of taste the same, don't get me wrong they're still delicious. I enjoyed getting just maybe 2 rolls an trying other stuff on the menu.   Turn off about the place thought? The waitress and waiters kept switching. A bunch of people would ask us for orders so we never knew who to tell or what to tell them. It's nice that they're attentive, but maybe just a little too much.",

This was actually less than a mile from our hotel, so we decided to take a quick Lyft ride over. There was no wait for a table at 6pm, but it got very busy after we sat down. We ordered their Baked Mussels, Salmon, Smoked Salmon, Giant Clam, Octopus, Uni, Miso Soup, Seaweed Salad, Dragon Roll, Beef Roll, Sun of the Beach and many others. They have a huge variety of options available. The fish and rice are very fresh. The only downsides was that the rice could use a little but more seasoning, since it tasted a little bland. The Baked Mussels were very good and we got many orders. Some rolls had a little too much mayo or cream cheese which made us full fast. The Beef Roll here was a little bit too hard and was not edible. The service here is quick and attentive, constant refill of water and taking away empty dishes. Overall an affordable alternative to the expensive buffets on the Strip. The price of $23.99 is very fair considering it being in Vegas.",

I got to say, this place is great!!!  the group of us did the all you can eat (AYCE) and I gotta say, its probably the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to.  As long as you are not expecting top grade shashimi and such like some of you sushi snobs do.... you will be very happy you came here to eat.  Best thing about it is you can order anything you want pretty much (some have a one order per person max, which is understandable), and I think that is great because they have a wide selection of items and they dont limit you to a preset AYCE menu which may happen at some other places.  The service was terrific as well... it was really busy but the staff handled the volume as well as you could expect.  Overall they were friendly and efficient.  I really cant ask for more when it comes to asian restaurant service.    So, finally, Im not going to go over the plates here, because there are so many to choose from.  But I will say that, if you want to come to a place where you and your friends can eat and have fun, eat good food, and stay within a budget.... come HERE!!!",

We had all-you-can-eat which included all sushi, appetizers, drinks, and dessert (mochi or ice cream)! It was very busy but the staff was hard working and friendly. They allow you to order half rolls (4 pieces) so you get to try more. We sat at the bar and the chef was very helpful in helping us order.

I had a business lunch and our guest chose this place. I told her I had one good and one not so good experience, but she was willing to take a chance as was I. We got seated fast and were greeted in a timely manner. Drinks came out fast. We ordered ACE sushi for three, and everything came out in a timely manner. Our waitress did forget one special order item that my guest ordered and didn't explain if it wasn't available or not. She just didn't bring it. When my guest reminded her, she stated she put the order in but maybe they couldn't do it. Rather than try and get a roll they don't make regularly, my guest opted for something else and it came out fast. The sushi was really good. It seemed very fresh too. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I do have a favorite Sushi place on the other side of town closer to home. Overall all this was a great lunch and we all left very full and happy.",

I would give Yama a 5 start, however I feel the service isn't the best, they've gotten better over the years but some servers are really rude and they don't have a constant system of taking care of guests. You'll find 3 people asking if you ordered drinks and random servers attending everyone so it is hard to know who and when you'll be attended to next. However the food is amazing and that's what keeps bringing me back!",

    "text": "If you want AYCE sushi done right, this is bar-none my favorite AYCE sushi establishment in Las Vegas (Pending if Kan-Pai ever goes back to AYCE).  I know this place has hundreds of reviews, so of course it was going to be busy when my girlfriend and I arrived at 6pm on Valentines Day.  It was only a 15 minute wait which went by pretty fast and we were seated.  Within 1 minute of seating our server asked us for a drink and an order.  None of that \"wait 5 minutes to get a drink, gives drink then walks away, comes back 3 minutes later to get an order\".  She was on the ball.  I ordered the Roger Roger! roll and some unagi.  3 minutes later our first 2 rolls were being served.  I just couldn't believe it.  So...Fucking...Fast.  It turns out that this was the theme, whenever a roll was ordered, within 3 minutes at most they would bring back our order.  A+ on the staff for everything.  There had to have been a dozen wait-staff buzzing around such a small area, but they were on the ball.  I did not have a single problem with any of rolls I ate, the Unagi was great and the Roger Roger! Roll will be my go-to choice in my future visits to Yama Sushi. As for desert I had some mango mochi and red bean ice cream.  It's impossible to do red bean wrong.  And I guess we didn't let the mochi thaw out since my gf and I both took a bite into it and it was hard as a rock...whoops!  I wasn't a fan of the miso soup, then again I am not gonna knock them for that since only Naked Fish does miso soup correctly to my knowledge.  Despite it being packed and somewhat crammed, it was definitely an enjoyable experience.  Believe in the hype...BELIEVE!!!!  PS: I'm a sucker for garlic ponzu sauce, any place that has that in winnar!  #99problemsbutAYCEsushiaintone #BelieveTheHype",

Sushi was okay, but the scallop was very BAD. It was obvious that it has been just melted to a room temp. very watery, spongy like, cold texture :/ yuck.  I was told you can leave two pieces per person without being charged. So I had to eat the whole two pieces cause I had to save that two pieces for the roll that we ordered.  MANWHORE ROLL, as it sounds, was DISGUSTING!!!!!! I am one of people who is not a picky eater - one of those that say \"ooo this is good!\" for everything but comon.... this roll.. was.. just horrible.  I think they come up with this roll just to increase their menu selections. freal.  yet the sushi was okay - esp salmon and white tuna-  but i should have left when I saw the cockroach..",

It calls to our most basic needs of food, wanting it to be good food and wanting it to be a lot of food (even if your definition of a lot is different than mine).    Ok, so about my experience, I haven't been to this place in like 4 years.  So when I walked up and the doors were tinted pitch black I didn't know if the place was open or closed, haha.  Of course they were open and behind those doors was a busy restaurant, small but busy.  It was a cool vibe and there was good music playing and ESPN on the TV, all pluses in my book.  I ended up sitting at the bar, a great choice because you order your sushi striaght from the sushi chef!!!  This really cuts down on wait time and it is super convenient.  The food came out fast and fresh and it did not dissappoint.  I had my favorites; Sweet Shrimp, Giant Clam, Cajun Albacore and Baked Green Mussels on top of some great specialty rolls.  I gotta say, I have been missing out; I remembered that I liked the place and I always remembered it was there but I truly forgot how good it really was.  I also have to say that the service was on point.  I didn't have to wait on anythng really.  It was a GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!  I am making myself hungry just thinking about it, haha, I might have to hit it up right now!!!!",

Price of 24 all u eat per person is fair, but I rather pay a little bit more to have more quality fish sushi. \"Man whore\" sushi is good, but the plate comes with 8 pieces and its really oily and cheesy... So I could only have one. Anyway, good service.",

    "text": "Oh man. I love All you Can Eat Sushi, and this place takes the cake.  Unfortunately, I do believe it was better 2-3 years ago. However, the new specialty rolls are amazing (I especially love Harry Potter, mmmm garlic).  I went there every week, a few times, without fail, my freshman year at UNLV. My friends and I all loved it. I saw it on the way home one day, tried it, loved it, invited my friends the next time. I live kind of far, but still tell others about Yama and try to take visitors whenever possible.  This place is extremely cheap for All You Can Eat. The service is excellent. It's somewhat small, but there's always room. I love their gyoza. Their garlic tuna is phenomenal. Halibut is excellent. Snow in Vegas, Yama Crunch, etc etc. ALL of them are great.  I used to know all of the sushi chefs by name, but they've changed around now. Paul and Howard were the best. One of them (Bruce, I think) moved to Momo Sushi on Stephanie. They would make me stuff that wasn't even on the menu. I asked them to make me a Family Roll from Momo. They made it better than Momo did with me just telling them what it consisted of! Japanese Lasagne, they tried and it wasn't the same as Osaka, but tasty nonetheless.  My absolute favorite All You Can Eat place. Beats Sushi on Trop - definitely. Plus...ALL YOU CAN EAT DESSERT! Mochi AND green tea ice cream? Soda in the can?! Sushi on Trop gives you a bite of ice cream and that's it!  These people are not stingy. I feel like I'm robbing them, actually.  Oh, also... I have never seen a place clean as much as them. They are very clean. Very fresh fish. Excellent all around.",

However, nowadays we have to get the most bang for our buck and one of the ways to do that is to go for buffets or all you can eat.   Most of  the sushi they serve here is really fresh. Very good taste and texture. Some of it was a bit disappointing but for $19.99 for lunch all you can eat. I think it is a small sacrifice on the consumers part. They do half rolls here so you can try a lot of the special rolls. They do not over stuff the rolls with rice either.  I had the halibut and yellowtail tuna and  it was quite fresh and tasty. The rolls are creative and had great flavor. Eel sauce anyone?   The service was excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive and they did not let your drinks to go empty. The sushi chefs were very fast and efficient. They are constantly aware if you are ready for more food. For the coup De grace, we had plum ice cream. Quite flavorful.   Awesome service and decent all you can eat menu.",

Instead we got sent to Kabukis east of the strip.  By the time we found out we were in the wrong place, the cab had left and a couple of us were about to go into alcohol shock from drinking at the pool all day.  We struck out across the expanse of Las Vegas roadways to find somewhere to eat some type of raw fish.  We ambled into a strip mall across the street and found Yama.  The service was a little slow, but that is the only unfavorable thing that I could say about this place.  They still served us even though not one of us had a BAC of under .15%.  We did the all you can eat sushi deal, and the food kept coming until we were all fairly coherent again.    The variety of rolls was great and just what we needed.",

I went in late night with my sister, we had about a 25 minute wait. We decided on the all you can eat deal which was AMAZING!!! The only catch was that we absolutely had to eat EVERYTHING. The food deserved a 5 star rating hands down I gave it 4 stars because of the waiting first and for most. We had to wait when we arrived, we had to wait 15 minutes for each item we ordered even drinks. The only other issue was the space. There are wayyyy to many tables and no walk space. I felt like i was eating a meal with strangers and we were so close i felt like i was a part of their conversation.",

It's a bit different that you order off a menu sheet & they don't bother to replace it with another order sheet (guess they don't want you to order more since it's an all you can eat).  Several disappointments: they were out of uni, when I order ama emi I expect it to be served with deep fried ebi but none came, their floors were slippery. Their dynamite is not what I expected (not enuff mayo for my taste).  Now the plusses: they have an extensive list of sushi rolls, the hamachi kama is HUGE & moist & the skin was onoliciously crispy. I'm not a fan of wasabi or ginger but my friends luvd it. This place  was busy for a weekday @ 2pm.",

I think if you are going to say \"the best I have had\" then say what you have tried and then compare, that would be most helpful in writing reviews for others to consider.

The place is cramped and the air blows in every time the door opens. The food was just ok, only the hamachi Kama and the soft shell crab app were good, the sushi was mediocre. Worst was that they kept telling you that you had to eat everything on your plate or they would charge you extra. Yes, like a parent telling a child to clean your plate; It's no joke. I'll never go back, felt like i was going to get in trouble for not eating enough rice. So the food is way way better at Makino and most buffets and Yama is not a great value and you get scoldings all for mediocre food.",

When I first arrived there, it was so packed that you couldn't get in and out of that door easily. Thank goodness a friend of mines arrived earlier than me and reserved a table, because if she hadn't we would've been waiting for a while like those at the door. :) Yay for my friend! Hopefully they can expand to a bigger restaurant soon, they have the business, so i don't see why not.   For how busy it was the service was decent. Servers and cleaners were busy all night, didn't look like they could have a break but they were on their A-game for sure. Once I was seated at the table she was ready to take our orders. Right on!!!   My friend and I took part in the AYCE special here, and I must say the most memorable dishes for me were the WET DREAM, STRIP TEASE, and the Seafood Salad. I ordered these dishes more than once. They were so good. The AYCE special was $22.95 I believe, which much cheaper than Sushi-Mon which is where i usually frequent. And for dessert, I highly suggest the MOchi Ice Cream. My favorite is the Mango. :)  This was a pleasant experience that didn't disappoint one bit :) I will be back!",

My friend and I sat at the bar and was trying to yell out orders to the chef, but he ignored us for the longest time. The other customers sitting next to us at the bar noticed it as well and even joked with my friend and me about it. I honestly was beginning to think the chef didn't speak English haha. Eventually, he decided to recognize our existence and gave us our Dragon Rolls, etc. He never said a word to us, besides repeating our order back to make sure he was correct. Never even cracked a smile. This guy was a straight robot!.....but he made bomb sushi haha Another disappointment was that they were out of ice cream. That's one of my favorite parts about getting sushi. Finishing it off with a nice scoop of Plum ice cream.  If I was rating this place just for food, they'd probably get 4 stars, but since it's based off of the entire experience, Yama Sushi can thank their \"amazing\" customer service and stocked inventory for the solid 2 stars it just earned from me.",

    "text": "Found this place to eat for lunch thru yelp. Thanks y'all 20 bucks durin lunch for the AYCE. A very awesome deal for an awesome meal. We ordered mainly the nigiri sushi. All the fish were pretty good, but the yellow tail was the star of this meal. One of the best pieces of yellow tail I've had for an AYCE deal. We ordered like 10 orders of this. The salmon (usually my favorite) was kinda lacking compared to most other places. For some reason, it wasn't as soft as I normally like to have it. Avoid the giant clam, my gf disliked it. The sweet shrimp nigiri is unique and different. It's like a raw shrimp which is pretty good at first... but afterwards ur mouth tastes like the ocean after a whale came in it. We also had Asahi beer. The rolls all have sexual names which is pretty cool, it made me wanna try it. Truth is, the rolls are pretty standard rolls labeled by unique names; we ordered half rolls of a few of the things. TNT roll was pretty much a spicy tuna roll. Wet dream, snow in las vegas, and maybe one other roll which I cant really think of. Yes, I normally stick with just nigiri sushi, but I couldn't resist the urge to try these sexual rolls!! Our server was sweet & funny, she recommended that we try some rolls and was pretty attentive. Definitely a place worth a try. I'd definitely wanna come back here in my future visits to Vegas. Not far from the strip, slightly down flamingo.",

    "text": "After reading all of the positive Yelp! reviews we decided to try Yama Sushi. It is located in a strip mall in one of the seedier neighborhoods in town and looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. Once you walk through their doors the magic begins! It's not fancy but it is comfortable and at four on a weekday afternoon they were at least 75% full.  We were greeted and seated almost immediately at a table for two that was comfortable. There was plenty of space between us and the closest table to us. The establishment is clean and there is a very pleasant odor wafting from the kitchen and the sushi bar.  Our server was very attentive and the food arrived very quickly. We were told to take our time. To eat a little at a time. We were not rushed at all.  It isn't necessary for me to list all of the dishes that we tried because they were all excellent and they are well covered by the 1700 or so other positive reviews. I will say that the Seafood Salad was spectacular! Huge chunks of tuna, salmon, shrimp and other seafood delicacies mixed with some vegetables in the most amazing dressing I have tasted in a very long time. We ordered the dish medium spicy. We ordered a second one with no spice and it wasn't the same. It contained the same ingredients but without the spice it just was not the same.  The rolls that we ordered were magnificent. Large regular sized orders of deliciousness and not the two or three pieces that you might get in other AYCE establishments.   I find it amazing that Yama Sushi can stay in business serving all you can eat great food at such great prices but I'm glad it Des. Dinner for two with two bottles of hot sake was under $60 plus tip. We plan on becoming regulars.",

They can use a renovation. I noticed their hostess podium was falling apart and nobody should have broken bar stools in the women's bathroom stall.",

We went back to one of favorite AYCE sushi joints, Yama Sushi, for an early lunch on Wednesday ($20.99/person).  Unlike other AYCE sushi places for lunch, Yama Sushi seems to have the largest selection of AYCE items and also offering both grilled Hamachi and Salmon collar, uni, geoduck, and sweet shrimp, albeit limited to one serving per person.  Their tasty seafood salad and mixed seafood poke both offer generous amounts of fresh seafood.  As with any AYCE sushi restaurant, your mileage may vary with regards to quality of food and timeliness of service depending the time of day you're there.  We tend to get there early in the lunch service, beating the lunch rush and getting the fish, presumably, at its freshest.  Yama Sushi joins Sushi House Goyemon at the top of my list of my favorite AYCE sushi places in town.  If you love sushi like I do, Yama Sushi continues to be a good spot to get your fill at a very fair price.",

This was a fall-back plan after we were unable to change our reservations at Sushi Neko.  Should have gotten the hint when we were able to make same day dinner reservations for a party of 20 on a Sunday night.   The rice on every sushi roll was mushy. The uni, the sweet shrimp were not fresh. I mean, visibly not fresh. You can see it in the color.  The other dishes and rolls are meh.  The people making the rolls and dishes are not Japanese and I'm not sure if they even know how these dishes should taste.  The only decent 2 things were the soft shell crab appetiser and maybe the salmon nigiri because of the fish to rice ratio. All other stuff is mediocre at best.   This place gets 2 stars because they allowed some of us to do AYCE and the kiddies a la carte.  This usually don't happen. The other star is for the good customer service. One waitress even went out to the parking lot chasing us down to return a scarf we left behind.",

I will have to say probably not the best time to visit this place but I did.   The restaurant is a clean and pretty big. They had four sushi chefs when I was there I figured that it would be enough. I know being valentines day it was going to be busy but it was just not enough to be overwhelmed like that.    The sushi chef kept skipping us! At first I thought maybe because I was hungry and ready for more. But then my party started to notice too. He took two new clients orders first two times before he got to ask one of our party if they were ready and then seemed to forget about our order PERIOD! The busboy staff where GREAT! They were very attentive and friendly. I have always had great service from sitting at a sushi bar not so much here.   At one point the chef lightly bumped into the mini sushi fridges where they store the fish and the roll just completely unraveled and spilled over to us. He even stated that it wasn't him bumping into the area so much as the roll not being made right. I was actually amazed he said that out loud because I was thinking it. We ordered three \"Palm Jobs\" three times and waited more than 30 minutes for it and he forgot about it all three times.  I gave up on my order and only one of us patiently waited again ONLY  after she got up and went over to him since he had already switched position to the other part of sushi bar ! I was over it.  I really want to say I would be back to give them a second chance but freshness and flavor were off as well. Something I did see was that a lot of their fish is  PRE-SLICED!  I haven't  seen that in a sushi bar  and thought It was off....   I did learn how to order everything sexy style which is with Avocado, jalapeno, and thin slice of lemon and a lemon sauce that I wish was Yuzu sauce.   I will stick with my regular sushi spot.",

First of all the wait to be seated was pretty long 45 mins,but I was expecting since I heard it was one of the best sushi places in town. As soon as we were seated, our server went over the \"instructions\" on how AYCE works...hmmm I guess.   The actual sushi was sooo delish! I had so much that I lost count after the second plate. Our server was as attentive as she could be since it was a pretty busy night.   Im not a patient person, so the long wait makes this 4 stars.... but still a must go. I WILL DEFINATELY GO BACK!",

We got the all you can eat and the service was very efficient and fast (espically for how busy they were). Our server was very sweet and funny and kept our waters refilled continuously. She even recommended us a great appetizer (the seafood salad is a must if you like raw fish). The sushi rolls were fantastic and tasted fresh. For the price that you pay for the all you can eat on top of the service we received and the quality of the sushi, this place was fantastic.",

We all decided on the all u can eat deal for $23.99 & am glad we did. We started off with apps like seaweed salad, fried mussels and tempura. All were very good! Then we got into the specialty rolls. They were all very good and they came out pretty fast. After ordering 8-9 rolls with a ton more apps we were done. Nice they had free hot green tea too. To top it off they have dessert with the din. I got the red bean ice cream & mango mochi. I was in frickin in heaven and my belly was happy.  I would def come back again. Just make sure u come with an empty stomach if u come here. Let's just say I slept really f'ing gooood last nite. #foodcoma",

    "text": "The sushi was fine, but after last night's experience, I refuse to ever go back. Here are the reasons:  1. A Fire Hazard: Even though the restaurant has recently expanded, it's still the size of an igloo.   2. Speaking of cold, the service matches just that. I told the hostess (Cynthia) that it will be a party of five for Angelina. She called me \"Angelica\" three times. The third time, she did it on purpose only because she knew I was pissed off and tired of correcting her.  3. Our waitress would not allow me to share one small piece of sushi with my friend who wanted to try it. The waitress said it was not permitted because my friend wasn't getting all-you-can-eat. If I want to share my food with a friend, I will share my food! I've never ran into that ridiculous rule at any of the MANY sushi joints I've ever been to.   4. Watch Your Car, Watch Your Back, Watch Your Belongings: Yama isn't exactly in the type of neighborhood where you can easily sit back and relax. Especially while waiting outside during long waits. There was this one shady dude in particular, who was flying by on a bike outside. He was screaming profanities to NO ONE in particular at the top of his lungs. He had no phone and no blue tooth on him either. Which brings me to my next two points, don't do drugs and there will be shady idiots.  5. How Long Can You Wait Before You Hit Boiling Point? Again, that place is too small, that's why you will always have to suffer the long wait times. On top of it, battling the children they have for hostesses, and then to follow, the rude waitress.   Everybody seems to be a genius when it comes to knowing the difference between good sushi and bad sushi. Unfortunately, everybody that goes to Yama, seems to have a hard time noticing the difference between good service, bad service and the obvious fact that you can go somewhere else cleaner, BIGGER, providing a much smaller wait time and still providing great sushi. Take that as a warning and a good tip, sushi lovers.  In regards to going to Yama Sushi, if you still decide to volunteer as tribute, may the sushi forever be in your favor. Because everything else there may not be.  Good luck!",

    "text": "After months of nonstop babbling from fellow yelper Nelson S. raving how Yama has the best AYCE sushi in Vegas, so good that I would have an \"orgasm.\" Well, no orgasm. I can finally shut him up.  Highlights on the menu: Deep fried muscles (never had that before. It was yummy), Sashimi salad spicy (mix of tuna and salmon with special sauce), Striptease roll (most expensive), and Manwhore (spicy).   I ordered the \"Harry Potter\" roll, and let me tell you, it does not even come close to the name of it ha ha. It looked so plain and tasted plain. There were other rolls that Nelson ordered like Dragon roll and I forgot the other name, but it was not good either. Too bad for him he had to eat it all by himself since I for sure wasn't going to help.   I was going to give Yama 3 stars, but gave extra credit because the Customer Service was top notch. The staff were friendly, attentive, and helpful. We never had to wait a long time to get seated, to get our drink refills, and to get our orders. Thats a big plus for me. And for UNLIMITED MOCHI?! Kudos.  Would I come back to Yama? Perhaps. Nelson S. would have to drag me to go again.",

They also messed up our check and once I asked them about it then said they'll take care of it and they didn't do anything about it so I had to complain once again.

Keep in mind that that we have been coming to this place for about 10 years probably at least 2-3 times a month (we are locals), so we tried pretty much every thing on the menu. I also try to schedule all my business lunches at this place.   First of all - come in hungry, try to sit at the bar and order all you can eat. Order no more than half the roll so you try more. Start off with seafood salad (just a bit spicy).  Go ahead and order wet dream (full roll) - it will take a while to prepare.  I take mine with sliced jalapenos to bring out the flavor.  In the meantime ask to try: Son of a beach, no name, happy ending, striptease, one minute man, ask for chef's own creation - they will hook you up if you continue to praise them.  Also place an order of baked mussels with the waiter. If you are new to sushi try salmon roll, I love salmon roll, or simply California roll.  Don't forget to tip both - your waiter and the chef who prepared the food.  They will remember you and take care of you next time. Expect some wait time during high traffic hours (like Friday or Saturday night or weekend lunch.  Do expect the place to be crowded . Still - highly recommended.",

    "text": "The first thing that I do when I'm planning a trip is to sniff out the local sushi restaurants. Where to stay, where to shop and what to see all come later.   Las Vegas certainly has no shortage of sushi bars, there are four or five on one section of the Strip alone! But, everyone has already heard of Nobu and I wasn't planning on walking through eight miles of Caesar's Palace just to try the place frequented by many a celeb in L.A.   I searched through the highest-rated sushi places on Yelp, and Yama was in the top 5. I now know why. Located just two miles away from the Vegas Strip, a discreet building with nothing but SUSHI adorned at the top of the marquee, sits this lovely little slice of heaven.   I've eaten sushi all over this country, but this was my first experience with an \"All You Can Eat\" menu. It took some adjustment, but once I got into the swing of it, I didn't want to leave. The menu is diverse, and depending on what time of day you visit, has different items up for bid. I ate at dinner, and the first major surprise was that I was seated immediately after I walked in the door, despite it being 6:15 on a Friday evening. Boom! I wanted to go full Beyonce and do the \"Single Ladies\" dance right at the bar.  The AYCE menu offered basically any sort of American-made sushi that one could want: Nigiri, Sashimi, Hand Rolls, Cut Rolls, Deluxe Rolls, Baked Rolls and so on. You have to get the chef's attention and shout your order (every seat in the place was taken) but the food is prepared quickly. The menu advises you to start slow, otherwise you'll burn yourself out. I started small: Tuna nigiri, Uni and Salmon skin. All were handed to me quickly, and the Uni...you guys. The Uni.   Since I was dining alone (the rest of my party were catching Donny and Marie at the Flamingo) I wanted to converse with people at the bar. The seating is tight, which I'm sure is to accommodate as many people as possible, and it makes for great conversation with the locals who frequent this place. If you don't like to chat with your neighbors, however, you might want to wait for a table.   The price almost felt criminal. I ate probably $60 worth of sushi for a dinner price of $25. That includes drink and dessert! (The mochi was great.) The staff was very attentive, and I never had to ask for a water refill.  All in all, I have no qualms with my experience at Yama Sushi. I'll be back in Vegas this summer to see Mariah Carey, and Yama will be on my schedule.",

The problem with sitting by the bar is you can see the tempura just sitting under a lamp not fresh and they pack you in on those stools, not a lot of freedom.  The rolls were good but not as much selection as I had hoped. The ayce does come with appetizers and nigiri. We got garlic tuna which was good and light. The cucumber salad was kind of bland. The seafood salad was great with radish noodles and I got to choose my fish- I did tuna and salmon. The chunks of tuna were great but we think the salmon is farm raised therefore more fatty as I could barely eat it. The good part was is you could choose your spice level so the spicy was perfect. The oh dam!! Harry!!! ( I think that's the name) roll was good and spicy, nice and not too heavy.  Overall a good experience and I would go back but my search for an ayce place I just crave continues... Found a sushi place but not ayce... So more sushi for me it is!",

    "text": "Good Sushi at a Fair Price! We walked into Yama Sushi @ 12:45pm on a weekday and it was PACKED! We sat at the last three seats at the Sushi Bar. We saw that they do an \"All You Can Eat\" Lunch. My husband, daughter and I really aren't big enough eaters to make this worth it, so we just ordered a la carte. Our orders were taken quickly. I got the Agedashi Tofu and a Veggie Roll in Soy Paper. My daughter ordered Miso Soup and a California Roll. My husband ordered a Spider Roll. We all really enjoyed our food. Everything tasted fresh and was served very quickly and our drinks were refilled before they were empty. All in all, this was a great place to get good sushi without the huge price tags of the places on the strip.",

I love that this restaurant is a True AYCE, you can order anything and everything, desserts and appetizers included.  Spicy tuna roll with scallions: mm so yummy, especially because the \"special sauce\" is just extra spicy mayo, but no complaints there  Spicy seafood salad: HUGE portion and tasty dressing  Salmon nigiri and unagi: Both solid, but heavy on the rice  Crunchy roll: have you ever had a bad one? Honestly? Nope so solid here but again heavy on the rice  Green tea ice cream: yummy but very icy, not super creamy if that makes sense  I guess im spoiled by Socal AYCE sushi joints that actually give you decent sushi:rice ratios! I actually dont like rice a whole lot so it made me uncomfortably full. Still a really solid AYCE place for being in the middle of Vegas and much more reliable than overpriced and underwhelming buffets on the strip.  Service is also a-ok",

    "text": "Authentic sushi seekers BEWARE! Things are not as they seem....   I am beginning to become more and more weary of reviews for Asian food on Yelp. This isn't the first time I've trusted Yelp with Asian food and ended up disappointed. 4 stars and 600 reviews? How can that many people have indiscernible palettes????   First I noticed right off the bat - the FISH IS FROZEN!!!! Wake up call everyone - when you walk into a sushi joint and the fish is PRE-SLICED, you are not eating fresh fish!!!!!!!! Never have I EVER had sushi where the chefs do not slice the fish from a refrigerated, fresh raw fish steak. I know a lot of people like that the sushi comes out quickly - and it does, to a point where it just doesn't seem right, and guess what, that's because the fish has been pre-sliced and it is not fresh. That in itself is enough to give 1 star to this place. What a disgrace.   We started off eating the highly regarded \"seafood salad.\" Looked like the ocean threw up a bunch of reject ahi tuna chunks. There were pieces of fish that were unidentifiable, sitting atop some julienned daikon radish in a pool of spicy-sweet sauce, similar to the sauce that comes in poke salads. There were red specks floating in the sauce that gave it a spicy kick. Each seafood salad looks different (according to the pics on here); mine had two random pieces of tempura in it, that were soggy from sitting in the pool of sauce. Okay.   We also ordered gyoza (pot sticker dumplings)- which honestly is a waste of stomach space when you're out to eat sushi, but gyoza's good, so whatever. The gyoza was deep fried, but it wasn't crispy. Gyoza is definitely frozen as well, and since when was gyoza by default deep-fried and you didn't get at least the option to have it steamed and fried on the bottom like, you know, traditional gyoza?   The test of fresh, high-quality fish can be found in an order of sea urchin. The caliber of sea urchin in a sushi joint will reveal the condition of other fish. For those who have eaten fresh, creamy sea urchin, you know that the color of it is a mild beige; it should look nice and plump, and taste like the ocean made flesh. My sea urchin was BROWN and was limp like it just gave up on life on top of the rice. It did NOT taste like the ocean made flesh. It tasted the way sea urchin tastes those times you have to mentally convince yourself that it is actually good, that you should actually swallow it even though your taste buds may be screaming out otherwise. Oh, also, my mackerel was dry. Fresh mackerel, like other fresh fish, should have a sheen to it. But of course, if you pre-cut your fish, dryness is to be expected.   Keep in mind I ordered all nigiri sishi here - with the exception of one roll that my dinner companion wanted to try. I'm sorry to break it to all you sushi-happy people, but if you only order rolls when you go eat sushi, you don't really like sushi. You like frikkin mayo, bitch. As a Japanese person, I know that it is a waste of stomach space to fill yourself up on fried batter, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. Really it is just a way to cover up the flavor of delicious raw fish. Then again - this place doesn't use delicious raw fish so maybe it is a better idea to mask the flavor of it. Believe me when I say Japanese people don't fuck with rolls the way non-Japanese sushi-eaters do. There is nothing wrong with choosing that route, though, I guess, and the roll was tasty, so I suppose with the price, this is somewhere you should come if you only eat fillers.   Lastly - I always order a hand roll with shiso leaf and ume (plum) paste as my last sushi - it is very refreshing and cleanses your palette before dessert. When I asked the sushi chef to make it for me, he asked WHAT IT WAS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I won't even comment further on this. That is just not right.   I know this review was full of vitriol, but someone had to say something. I do not understand how this place is so popular. This place is to sushi as Taco Bell is to Mexican food. It didn't taste bad, and that's the only thing I can say about it. Taco Bell doesn't taste bad either. I would much rather spend a few more dollars at a Japanese-owned Goyemon or Sushi Mon and know I am getting fresh, high-quality fish. There are only so many meals I will eat in my life, and I regret having wasted one of them on this place. Two stars for punctual, friendly service (only from the servers, not the sushi chef). Will not be back, EVER!",

I know most all you can eat sushi places do have the rule of charging unfinish food but this place strictly enforce it...  Our waitress acted like a bitch right from the start. We felt like we were being stared down... There were also times where she obviously stops at our table to look at our un eaten rice on our plates... She also checks all our plates for uneaten foods right in front of us!! It felt like I was being checked for illegal items at the TSA security line!! Which makes our meal there very uncomfortable...  The food there was ok... they do have Uni and sweet shrimp (one per person, sweet shrimp is only 1 piece per person). Quality was up to par.. Certain chefs put tons of rice on the rolls...   Honestly i should have spent my money at one of the better buffets on the strip..",

(Actually, a bunch of friends were meeting up somewhat spontaneously and so I gleefully tagged along...)  I definitely wanted to get a little more of my money's worth out of the buffet this time. Thankfully, I had also a little more time to plot my strategy since I wasn't running so late. I definitely wanted to get some variety in,. so I started again with the Seafood Salad, which is basically the closest thing to all you can eat sashimi (as long as you don't mind the \"medium\" level of spiciness). Then I picked up the I Love Salmon so I could enjoy... well, salmon. It had cream cheese inside, plus more salmon and avocado on top. Nothing extremely fancy.  I also nicked a few things from others' orders, including the creamy Man Whore, a yummy salmon skin roll, and an EXCELLENT piece of the Wet Dream. It's a warm, gooey explosion in your mouth! (no innuendo intended, ahem...)  The Double Dragon that came next was the only one that I ate all by myself, which I guess I owed to everybody getting pretty full by then. It was a very delicious and sweet unagi (eel) roll, and I definitely could've ordered a second one, but I had to save room for the Yama Crunch to cap off the meal. It's crunchy shrimp tempura and crab meat, probably a piece of cucumber too, and it's clearly the most solid roll all around. Heck, they gave it the same name as the restaurant, so it's gotta be good. I ate most of the pieces, but I passed the last tail piece off to a friend who also really loves the Yama Crunch (and also because I was starting to reach the fringes of \"nauseatingly full\").  I can't say I've experienced much of the competition, but this is probably some of the best all you can eat sushi out there, period. I think I'd be really hard-pressed to find better.",

You are then given the option of eating at the sushi bar or at a dining table, but of course with a smaller group you want the full experience of watching the chefs prepare the sushi in front of your eyes. As you take your seat the friendly chef greats you and asks if you are there for the \"All You Can Eat\" sushi deal? The answer, for most locals is always yes. The offer is $20 at lunch and $25 at dinner time. If you have any sort of an appetite then you better take advantage of this steal. With individual sushi plates running as high as $12 each, you would be foolish not to go for the big deal. With different assortments of colors and textures you can't predict how your first bite of each plate will taste, but you can count on the consistency of high quality through out the entire meal. If you have the appetite for it, there is a great variety of appetizers and desserts to choose from, all of them are covered by the $25 price. For starters they offer anything from edamame to chicken and rice samplers.  What may be a minor problem for some visitors but to some is a sign of authentication is the thick accents that most of them carry. The language barrier makes the service just that much more fun and entertaining. If you are not patient enough to try your luck with pronouncing the names of these dishes, there are order numbers next to the names on the menu.  The best part of the whole presentation is the effort the chef puts into each and every plate to really allow the food to speak for itself.",

    "text": "My new hubby and I like to try and venture out of the strip when we stay in Vegas.  With the help of fellow Yelpers, we discovered Yama Sushi which is on Flamingo, about 3 miles east of the strip.  As we sat down at the the sushi bar, the lady who was sitting next to us said, \"This place is awesome!\"  For the price of $22.95, you get all you can sushi, rolls, appetizers, soups, salads, ice cream, and mochi ice cream.  The names some of the rolls are hilarious, such as:  Happy Ending, Man Whore, The Strip Tease, Wet Dream, One Minute Man!  We tried the Strip Tease, which has shrimp tempura, crab meat, cream cheese, eel, avocado and crunch on top.  It was delicious!  What is nice about this place is that you can order any roll whole or half or in a hand roll, which helps to minimize waste.  I would also recommend sitting at the bar, for faster service.  I recommend this place to my fellow yelpers who want good sushi, at an affordable price.  :)",

They offer an all-you-can-eat option that follows the same rules as other places around town.  The floor space inside makes it one of the smaller establishments to which I've been a patron.",

    "text": "Finally made it in to Yama Sushi after years of driving by and reading the sign. We got their for dinner and was very surprised to see people waiting to get in! We put our name on the list for dinner for 2 and was seated in a few minutes and not the 15 minute wait that was estimated. The guy taking names was doing a pretty good job of getting people seated ASAP. The place was packed wall to wall with diners and probably many were from UNLV a few blocks away. We saw some guys having what looked like seafood poke and found out it is called seafood salad. We ordered one for each of us and liked it very much. I ordered UNI, but I don't know why it takes so long for it to be prepared, I am thinking it must be frozen since it's not something everyone eats or can stand to eat. My UNI order came probably 1/2 hour after I ordered it and it was just OK, not that fresh flavor I like. Other than that everything was really good and not overly sauced up. Tasty Goyzas, fried to perfection! Seaweed salad was good too. Hawaii roll was great and probably my favorite. I also ordered giant clam and they brought me over red snapper, but I don't care really. Overall great place, but too far from Henderson. Even so we will be back, it's probably our current #1 place for sushi. Many of the other Sushi places have lowered their standards and have lost us as diners.",

This is why I have never tried fish, sushi, shellfish, etc, because I've been worried about that dead fish smell and automatically associate any seafood with it.  When I first met my boyfriend, he said he would take me out for sushi and I frowned but he didn't understand why. He had to \"show\" me that it's not a fishy smell. We went to Yama Sushi, and he was absolutely right!  We ordered the Sun of the Beach roll which had shrimp tempura, eel, and avocado in//salmon out with their spicy mayo and eel sauce. I am not kidding when I say I could drink the spicy mayo. It's not a burning spicy at all!  We ordered another one to share, and he had an order of tuna. I tried that as well, and no fishy smell whatsoever. Let me just reiterate that my senses for the \"fishy\" smell are so sensitive that I do not eat tuna fish, cooked fish, crab, anything like that!  Yama never disappoints and now I love eating sushi!  Thank you Yama!",

So since returing to San Diego can't find a place like that here (Yelp Help Please).  Anyway, after planning a trip to Las Vegas I thought maybe it is a Nevada thing and I read about Yama Sushi on Yelp and decided to give them a try.   Hello Sushi!!!!!  The previous reviews had it nailed down tight.  The behind the bar services was a little disappointing (tea, edamame, miso, water and such) but the sushi coming out from behind the bar was the BOMB!  Friendly, fast, creative and oh so delicious.   Bottom line, if you are going so that your hot tea glass never runs dry you better try some place else but if you are going for some really great sushi at a great price.  This is your place.    Anyone know of anything like this is San Diego??   Enjoy!!!!",

First impression, nice little place.  the lady gave us a sheet of paper to order on, so we  started out with our usual 6 orders of nigiri , 3 half rolls & 2 hand rolls.  20 mins later, two half rolls come in. surprising because  usually, the nigiri comes before the rolls. after we scarf down the rolls, we r ready for more! we wait, n wait, n wait, and finally some nigiri. we are expecting to get our 6 orders of nigiri at this point, but we only get 1. took us about 2 seconds to finish them and we are playing the waiting game again. 10 minutes goes by and we have 2 more pieces of sushi in front of us. this is where things started to get annoying. we have been here for more than 40 minutes, got 2 half rolls and 2 orders of nigiri. it was 2pm on a Friday afternoon and the place was not busy. we began to think they forgot our order. we ask the lady for the third time where is our nigiri and the rest of our order, she then doubled check and came back to tell us it will be right out & that it took awhile to get our scallops ready (bullshit!!). as we were still waiting, & thirsty at the same time since our cup of green tea was empty. the waiter comes by to see our cups were empty and does not refill our glass. take in mind, that the hot pot of tea was in her hand. I think that was our sign to leave and to never ever return to Yama sushi again. just tooo dammmmn ridiculous.",

    "text": "Tonight Clayton and I went out for some AYCE (All You Can Eat) Sushi with big appetites so that we could try as many items as possible. We do Sushi like this pretty frequently and find that having a big appetite increases the value of a dinner that generally runs upwards of $50 dollars for two. Yama Sushi's prices for AYCE are within the average that you would find in most Las Vegas sushi restaurants, but we think the quality of the food and experience are above average, so you feel as though you are getting a deal.  Dinner hours can be very busy. The restaurant itself would probably be considered small (between 50-75 seats). Getting there early or planning on a later dinner will ensure that you are seated right away. We arrived at 8:15pm on a wednesday night and waited about 15 minutes for a table. We noticed that at about 9pm it appeared that there would be no wait.  Service has always been polite and very attentive. If you sit at the bar there are plenty of chefs to take your order and chat with as you dine. Also the restaurant is a little cramped for space so we always sit at the bar. less noticeable.  The chefs are quick as well. The atmosphere behind the bar is light, accentuated by the chefs colorful uniforms and the floral art that adorns the walls. It leaves the customer feeling relaxed and ready to enjoy a great meal.  Our drink orders were taken quickly after being seated , and we chose a few appetizers to get the ball rolling on our evening.   Here's a breakdown of some of the items we selected this time around, for those of you that have never gone to a sushi bar, or who are perhaps curious about some items they've never tried.   Gyoza- We always start with a Gyoza  (fried dumpling) appetizer. It was a delicious way to begin. Crispy and savory.   Salmon Kama- This item took a long time to come out of the kitchen, but was very tasty. It was a fairly large portion of salmon that had appeared to be baked. Less of a traditional sushi item, but that is part of what is great about AYCE. Nearly every item on the menu is available for you to try, and the GF and I make a point of trying a few new items each time. For a cooked salmon dish it was excellent. cooked well. Good flavor. Accompanied by a sweet brown teriyaki style sauce for dipping the flaky pieces of fish.  Sushi Salad (Ordered Creamy)- Great light appetizer. Fresh tuna and salmon atop cucumber slices and what I believe is a mild radish that has been turned into a fine sort of angel hair. I should be more certain about this, but some dishes I don't question I just stick them in my face knowing it is going to awesome again.  Yakitori- Essentially an asian style chicken Kebab. Very tasty, and a good item for those that tag along hoping to avoid the sushi. Chicken is very tender and seasoned well.  BBQ Ribs- Another appetizer. Apparently we were in the mood for them. This would be another great choice for a non sushi eater. A small portion, but seasoned well. Both sweet and savory. The meat is tender but fatty. A great little appetizer.  Snow In Vegas-This is a great roll for those that enjoy something relatively light with a spicy kick but also a sweet side. Use of different sauces makes these characteristics come through. Was my favorite of the night.  Yama Crunch- Shrimp tempura, of which there are many options at Yama Sushi. Good flavor and texture. The crunch is sweet and mixes well with the more savory tempura inside.  Ellen Roll- Big bites. Lots of different elements going on on this one. Made with soy paper which adds a unique flavor. Spicy sauce on top is great.  Smoked Salmon and Salmon Sashimi always comes out super quick and fresh. Great color and texture.  Overall: Always happy with flavor of special rolls. Appetizers come out hot. Staff is attentive and polite. Atmosphere is relaxed. Price is fair for quality. Always a great experience, if you love sushi, you have to try this spot.",

For a minute, you might think you're in a whore house in disguise. I sure as hell did. This is Vegas after all. But no worry, this place is legit.  They just know that sex sells. Especially when it's associated with fish. Raw fish. Or not so raw fish. They don't even try to be subtle about the sexual themed specialty rolls. It's just like \"one minute man.\" \"hand job.\" \"wet dreams.\" Those dirty minded sushi chefs must be hard at work. (wait for it...) \"that's what she said!!\"  All kidding aside, Yama is perfect to eat at with a group. Order one of each of the in-yo-face sexually themed rolls to share between you. Everything's part of the all you can eat price. Starters, appetizers, standard rolls, special sex-themed rolls, soup, entrees, desserts!   The sexy time rolls are good, but super rich and lubed up in creamy sauce and mayo. Which is ironically appropriate. You definitely have to share these. The real sushi rolls (as in raw) are fresh and light. Seaweed salad was a good starter, and the green tea ice cream topped off a climactic lunch.   YAMA-zing. It's definitely worth more than just a one night stand. I'll be back for more next time I'm in town. See you soon, Yama baby. lol.",

    "text": "Holy crap was this place good and the price?  Even better!  After looking through Yelp and trying to pick between the multiple AYCE sushi places in Vegas we finally settled on Yama.  Boy were we happy we did!  There were soooo many people, yet they seated us within 10 minutes at the bar.  Their sushi chefs work SO fast, and each roll or piece of sushi came out looking so expertly made!  We were paying AYCE prices for the quality and chefs of a pay per sushi type place!   They also have everything you could possibly want from a sushi joint.  Miso Soup, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad, Ono (white tuna), hamachi, tempura, all the standard rolls, and even a massive menu of their self designed rolls.  God it was all so delicious!  They don't do the standard practice of using a ton of rice, only a little bit of rice (which is also sticky and deliciously flavoured) on their rolls and sushi.  Each roll or sushi we got was better than the next.  This restaurant by itself seriously makes me want to move to Vegas.    Then the bill comes  20.99 a person!  WHAT??!?  We added up our total if we were to order it all normally.  The girlfriend and I would have ate $150 worth of sushi/rolls.  It was hands down the best sushi restaurant we've been to, bar none (including non-AYCE).  Price:  5 stars Food:  5 stars Service:  5 stars  PERFECT SCORE!!!!  BONUS:  They offer Mochi Ice Cream as desert!  +1!  Side story:  When we were half way into our meal, a wedding party came in!  Like 20+ people and the wait staff scrambled to seat them all.  They ended up sitting at 4-5 different tables scattered throughout the restaurant and many sat at the bar.  It's that damn good people!",

    "text": "I *hated* Sushi until one fateful night I was dragged to Yama Sushi.  I hadth seafood salad and I thought it was yummy. My friend informed me that it had raw fish in it, and encouraged me to try the Yama Crunch roll. Since then, I have been hooked on sushi in general. What keeps me coming back to Yama Sushi is how GOOD the rolls are! Almost every roll is like YUM OMG. The service is really good too.  I also like all the appetizers and the gyoza. Overall best Sushi place for me!",

    "text": "When it comes to sushi if your anything like me you have your favorite place and you stick to it! This place is a must try so it can be just that for you. Before i get too far into the review i want to make it a point that i have been here at least a hundred times over the past 5 years maybe even much more than that but i dont want to exaggerate. Everything here is always fresh, my favorite roll is the Yama crunch, its a shrimp tempura roll with crunchy stuff and eel sauce,  but they have so many to choose from I'm sure you'll find a favorite of your own my dad loves the spicy tuna but its a lil too spicy for my taste.  Lets talk about everything else besides sushi for a moment. They have some awesome appetizers my favorites are the sesame chicken which i guarantee you'll want multiple orders of, soft shell crab is great, i love yakitori ( chicken skewers with grilled onions, mushrooms, and zucchini with plenty of teriyaki sauce) also the pork spare ribs are always cooked to perfection just a little pink round the bone. Also i dont eat them personally but my dad and grandma rave about the green mussels, plus they also got all the beef and chicken teriyaki that most others have.  So even if your not a fan of sushi or sashimi there are plenty of other things to enjoy without even having fish! Oh miso soup is great also far as drinks i love faygo root beer, great house saki and other types if saki as well and you can't forget about the big bottles of Sapporo!  All in all there is something here for everyone and a must try cause this WILL BE your new favorite place.  Best to call ahead at least 15 minutes because as with all fantastic places this place is always slammed-even at lunch both rooms get fill quickly,  I really hope all you sushi lovers give this place just one shot i give my word thats all you'll need is one shot and you'll be hooked!! Enjoy yelpers and btw anyplace with as many reviews as this place that are all great reviews should tell you something. So give your usual spot a break and give Yama sushi a try, one more thing, Your Welcome lol - you'll thank me later :)",

Plus: You can order half rolls Minus: The rolls did not taste as good as Sumo Sushi  Every roll seem to have had Spicy Tuna in it. I love it but it all begins to taste the same...   I was going to list all the rolls we had and rate them to taste but everyone has different tastes so I suggest if you are going to Vegas and do not wish to stray too far from the strip, this is the place to go!  If you want to stray a lil, go to Sumo Sushi 2!",

    "text": "This place is great!  This was our second visit to Yama.  We're from L.A., and it has been years since I've found an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that is this good overall.  So, on this trip to Vegas, I was looking forward to returning to Yama, and it was everything I had been looking for.    Note that I don't usually eat \"fusion\" sushi, nor all-you-can-eat or pre-prepared sushi.  My preference is for \"purist\" sushi, with no California Rolls or Spicy Tuna, no tempura in the rolls, and certainly no mayonnaise sauces.  I suppose I'm a bit of a sushi snob.  (Sushi in Tokyo spoiled me).  However, this place is a great mixture of quality, value, and unique rolls, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Yama is primarily fusion -- lots of americanized rolls, many including tempura or other cooked items, but plenty with fresh fish as well.  The rolls were great, but the sushi-style pieces were quite nice as well.  I sampled Saba (mackerel), eel, white tuna, albacore, and hamachi, and all were very fresh and excellent cuts.  My wife and I also sampled many rolls, and all were fantastic.  The \"palm job\" ended up being my favorite \"fusion-style\" roll (hand-roll of soft-shell crab with eel sauce and a few other goodies wrapped in soy paper).  To be clear, you're not going to come here looking for mind-blowing omakase, or purist single-piece japanese-style sushi like Echigo or Sasabune in West L.A.  That's not what this place is trying to accomplish, and you hopefully already know you're not going to find that style of sushi at AYCE.  However, Yama isn't what I would consider \"AYCE quality\" sushi -- it is much better.  Last year we ate at a table, and service was decent (very friendly, but they're very busy so the waitresses got to you as quickly as they could, but sometimes it took a little while).  This time we sat at the sushi bar, and had a fantastic time.  Sushi chef Pauw (I'm pretty sure that was the spelling) was lightening fast, whipped up fantastic cuts of fish and beautifully presented rolls, and had a great \"attitude\" at his game -- a mixture of seriousness, pseudo-impatience, and \"so what'll you have next?\" pressure.  But a few funny remarks back and forth, and he would crack an ear-to-ear grin.  Every few minutes he would raise his hands like an orchestral conductor, beckoning the diners to call our their orders.  I'll absolutely try and get seated at his portion of the bar on my next trip!    Five stars comes from freshness, flavor, excellent value, and speed of service at the sushi bar.  Even if you're a self-described sushi-snob like me, give it a try.  It has an off-strip \"neighborhood\" atmosphere, and it just may surprise you.",

    "text": "This place was fairly small but we didnt have to wait long! So this place does have AYCE prices are fairly cheap! dinner is $23.95 & forgot how much lunch was but the entire menu including dessert is part of AYCE with some exceptions where only 1 order per person. BUT you can just order each roll or sushi without getting the AYCE. But obviously if someone in your table is getting AYCE then everybody needs to get AYCE.   THE GOODS: to be honest dont remember everything I ate but their salmon sushi is really good quality! I LOVE SALMON and other few sushis and was glad to have the sushi be good quality! eel sushi was good too, seaweed salad was good, yellow tail collar was really good!! m first time trying it and i fell in love! also their halibut? yellow tail? i forget which one comes out with pondu(?) sauce and hot sauce on the top which was weird cause i never had it like that in other resturants. it wasnt bad just different. LASTLY ICE CREAM!! can never go wrong with ice cream but they have 2 types mochi and regular ice cream; mochis didnt taste like they were old or anything which was nice!  THE BADS: the sushis came out with a little bit too much rice which made me full quicker, the rolls are not the rolls you imagine (was very disappointed, actually asked the waiter if this is the right order a couple of times) the uni has all right, had better but not soo fresh but its a cheap place so not complaining, sweet shrimp was all right too comes with fired head. since it was full they forgot our orders a several time and unlike other places they dont have a paper where you mark what you want to order so they can forget.  OVERALL its cheaper then my usual AYCE sushi places as well as a little bit lesser quality. I'll come back if i just want some cheap AYCE but wont definitely go around raging about this place",

It's only now that I write this review that I realize that AYCE written in other reviews mean just that! I guess that I was born way sms and I never did catch-up to this common use of acronyms.  In any case, there is \"a la carte\" menu here but the price of just a few individual items brings the bill up to more than the price of the \"AYCE\" which was around $21 for lunch and around $25 for dinner. However, this is good sushi and the set price actually include nigiri with the limitation that you can have only one order of the more expensive ones. The orders are two pieces but the pieces are generous and there is enough variety to only eat nigiri is that's what you prefer (I tend to prefer nigiri has the ratio fish/rice is much higher and it's tastier according to my own taste). Not the highest quality sushi I ever had but quite nice and a good deal if you are hungry (I wasn't that much and ended eating too much).",

I love sushi and go many places for it and I even work in a sushi place so I know how it works and the differences between good and bad sushi.  My experience didn't start out bad, we were greeted politely at the door and that was about the only thing that was good about our experince. The server we had, didn't even tell us her name, was extremely rude and got out drink order and that was the ONLY interaction. Next to us a mom and son got sat and the server asked if they were doing ayce and if they wanted to start with appetizers. I wasn't very happy because my server had not done the same. Inconsistent.  It took us staring around at the sushi guys for about 5 min before anyone asked us if we wanted to get started with sushi. I love my nigiri but the salmon was very chewy and I got through one bite before I had to stop eating it. My girlfriend started with some tuna and albacore and it was decent along with my tuna. She also ordered the tofu which she took one bite of and said was absolutely awful. The server also never checked back and we had to flag someone down for the bill.  I am BEYOND disappointed for all the hype this place has gotten. Heck I was even recommended coming here by one of my guests while I was working. My girlfriends coworkers come all the time and I can't see why. We will NEVER be coming back and I hate leaving a place hungry, but that's how bad of an experience we have had.",

I've recommended it to so many of my friends.  SOOO here's how I fell in love with this place......  It was about 2 years ago that my friends & I were wondering what we should go eat, 1 of my friends suggested sushi, me never having tried sushi in my life was soooo opposed to that, but I'm a firm believer in try everything at least once before you decline. So, we were set on sushi, then my friend said \"I've heard great things about this place called Yama Sushi on Flamingo, lets GO!\" So we went, at first i was hesitant because i mean, 1. I've never in my life tried sushi before & 2. I was nervous that i wouldn't enjoy my time there due to me not liking the sushi. ((wasn't the case at all)) So, long story short, we tried so many delicious rolls & I absolutely fell in love with not only sushi itself, but Yama Sushi as well.   From the get go the service was amazing, we were welcomed with a warm smile, the service was fast & efficient & THE FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY DEELISH!!!  Since my 1st time visiting Yama, I've become a sushi eating monster, It has become my Go-To sushi joint. I've been there with co-workers, close family & friends, etc & they all love it ((the ones that have never been that is))   All in all I absolutely love this place. They have so many different rolls & dishes to choose from, I swear every time I leave here i am in a sushi coma & with what I like to call a \"Sushi Baby\" because I'm so stuffed lol. Of course every time i go I order the All You Can Eat. OMG!! & the Mochi!! ugh!!! That's definitely a MUST..my fave is the Chocolate Mochi =)  I HIGHLY recommend this place.",

Everything looked exactly the same, the picture of a perfect neighborhood sushi bar, just larger than I remember with the side room (was that there before?)   The host was kind to seat me quickly at the sushi bar, and a server appeared as soon as I sat down. Nice! I ordered the Kiss My Ass roll, in the mood for something really spicy. It was, well, oversauced. Way too much sauce. The menu read hot pepper sauce, this was tangy, creamy, very little spice and it needed a little sweetness. The shrimp inside were Tender and flavorful. Shrimp tempura with spicy tuna & hot pepper sauce, sounded promising for spice but for that creamy (gag) sauce all over the place...  A couple quick shots of sake to forget about that sauce, the server was quick with the check, and that was it- I was outta there, likely for the last time. The service was good, but I really couldn't stomach the thought of another roll. If ever I find myself back here, I'd stick with basics or sashimi, as their fish looked nice, and I would order all sauces on the side. It's a 2 1/2 for service and the tender flavorful shrimp. But I really wouldn't venture out of my way for Yama.",

They're not really friendly, especially on a busy night.

As we were ordering food, they took forever to give us our food, I understood they were busy, but the one waiter we had didn't even come to check up on us or anything. All the waiters we had, they just gave us attitude. And with slow service? But to top it off, at the end of our dinner, we got our check and they automatically charged us 18% for tip because we were a party of 6 or bigger. For a restaurant that does that, they don't have employees that value customer service anymore because they feel like they can take forever and not give you proper service. Why? Because no matter how long they take or how bad customer service is, they will still get here 18% tip. Save your money and go some place else.",

    "text": "When in Las Vegas, a buffet is a must. However, if you want to have some quality sushi away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, you should definitely check out their AYCE sushi. I'd rate the quality a 7/10. Better than your average AYCE sushi place.  They have a pretty extensible menu with everything from nigiri to much fancier specialty rolls with some interesting names like \"wet dream\", \"son of a beach\", and \"man whore\". To start off, I ordered a few of their nigiri. The seafood was fresh (except for one of the clams I had that had was a bit too fishy for me) and expertly prepared. Each nigiri order comes with 2 pieces. For most options, you're able to order it multiple times. Though for a few of the more expensive seafood, only one order per customer.  One thing to definitely remember and is stated on their menu is to remember to eat all your food AND not just eat the fish and leave the rice. Wasting isn't cool, so you should either make sure you're able to eat all your food or order a half order of the rolls. You'll be charged for any significant amount left overs.  Parking was free and plentiful. Would definitely recommend anyone to try here, but don't set your expectations too high. It is an AYCE after all.",

There were good and bad points:  The place is busy and really loud. But that just means that it's popular and better food turnover so that's a plus.  The selection is massive, and the originality on the rolls was superb. My only complaint on the rolls is that all the \"fancy\" specialty rolls were a bit spicy for me so I couldn't enjoy them.  But they are huge portions so you won't leave hungry.  Along with rolls I had Nigiri,  the #1 reason I eat sushi is for nigiri.  Unfortunately I wasn't as impressed with these..  Sure they were very large pieces, but the flavor was lacking and the Saba was very dry.  Which is my favorite.  The fish seemed subpar for what I'm used too at a sushi AYCE.  I like the salmon to melt in my mouth, this I had to chew..    Anyways,  25$ was well worth it so I was pleased..",

Their AYCE terms are quite generous: $23.95 for dinner (2 hr limit) where you can order off practically the whole menu (certain higher-ticket items are just one order per customer), dessert included. This is a rundown of what I had:  GOOD: salmon sushi (fresh and generously portioned), eel sushi (well-prepared without too much sauce), seafood salad (a sashimi salad--large chunks of fish, good dressing), broiled yellowtail collar (good), some kind of spicy something roll (if you like rolls you're in luck!), free dessert (can't go wrong with ice cream!), friendly and fast service.  MEH: their sushi rice overall (I know not to expect good sushi rice at these kinds of places and this was no exception), uni and scallop sushi (since this is a higher-ticket item you're entitled to only one order, but honestly, who'd want another lackluster quality order?), sweet shrimp (shrimp was ok but not butterflied and put on rice and the deep-fried head was a monstrously breaded and fried travesty).  I'm definitely at that point where I'd rather have a little something really good rather than a lot of something just OK. That said, if you're looking for a sushi bargain in the desert, this could be a worthwhile stop.  STEPH JUDGEMENT: Good if you want a LOT of OK sushi, especially rolls.",

All the way to the bathroom the floors were quite slippery and it just is sore for the eye. I would eat here again, great AYCE.",

I love the Yama Crunch and the Dancing in the Sheets rolls!  The dining room is small and cramped and this place looks kinda shady from the outside,  but don't worry about it!  For dessert, go with the mochi ice cream- it's a little ball of heaven! They have chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and mango.",

Service was great, the price is unbeatable at $24 a person, and the quality is impressive.  The seafood salad was amazing just on its own ( we ordered 2)!  We ordered 2 orders of uni (comes in 2 pieces per order), 2 orders of sweet shrimp (only comes with 1 piece per order), white tuna (my first time having this, it has a milky like consistency which I enjoyed), 2 orders soft shell crab (so good, light and crispy), miso soup, salmon kama (wanted hamachi but they ran out), quail eggs, 2 mochi ice creams (strawberry and mango...each order is 1 piece which they cut in half, perfect for sharing). We also got a large hot sake and a Kirin and our total was $66 for 2 people. I think that's a great deal and although I left a few chunks here and there they didn't charge me so that's great. (I always worry that I have to completely clear my plates at ayce). I will be back for sure.",

There was a small room on the side that fit our group perfectly. The quality of the fish was very good. Maybe not as good as a top tier sushi bar but far better than anything at a buffet or most other AYCE places that we've tried in Southern California. The seafood salad was especially good and reminded us of a good \"poke bowl\".  We tried the Salmon, Tuna, Albacore, Snapper and Yellowtail sushi in addition to just about every roll on the menu. All of the sushi and most of the rolls were very good.  The No Name roll was probably our favorite roll.  The mussel appetizer and mochi desert were a very nice touch and helped round out the meal.  Most of our group like spicy food and many of the rolls were unexpectedly spicy but I can see where that might turn off some people. $20.95 may be expensive for a typical lunch, but considering the appetite of our group and how much sushi we finished off I would consider this a pretty good deal. As mentioned by many others, the service was very good and fast with the waitress giving us a couple of nice recommendations.  The only drawback is that I can't come back for lunch until the next time I'm in town!  I can't wait to hit this place again on my next sojourn to Sin City!",

I'm guessing everyone else reads Yelp, too, because the place was pretty packed for a Tuesday night...at 6:00. We didn't relent, however, and whiled away 30 minutes shopping at the TJ Maxx nearby.   The place is tiny, as most reviewers have said, and the atmosphere friendly. We also were served by the most opinionated, cheeriest server ever. She was like a super happy Christmas elf hopped up on caffeine (got a mental image yet?), as she recommended us a bunch of speciality rolls, as well as how we should pace ourselves (i.e. get a half roll to try, then whole if you really like it, since they charge for leftovers). She seemed really knowledgeable, so we took most of her advice, and really glad we did! Some of our favorites include: Sun of the Beach, Wet Dreams, Superman, and the Untitled one (I think it's #24?). I also tried the fish by itself and got the garlic tuna, which was fresh and sprite. Even the side dishes were delicious, including the miso soup. This is one of the few AYCE places that I really felt I was getting a delicious, well-crafted bang for my buck.",

    "text": "This place never disappoints!  We always make a stop here on our Vegas trips, and it's just a short cab ride from the strip.    Rule #1, come early because there's always a line (especially if you have a big party). Rule #2, order a lot on your first round because it's hard to get them to let you order more afterwards. Rule #3, eat fast so that they will clear your plates and keep them coming.  They don't make your other items if your table is still full of food for obvious reasons.  All you can eat along with the great quality is hard to find.  They even have Uni and hamachi kama.  So come here and enjoy stuffing your face for less than 30 dollars out the door.",

We were quickly seated and drinks were brought out and a waiter there to take our order. We literally just spoke out loud about what we wanted to try and he said half rolls were good for trying things out. in a jiffy, appetizers and some rolls were brought out. of course, being a huge harry potter fan, that had to be the first roll i tried. it wasn't much, but it was still delicious. Overall, my favorite roll was Dancing in the Sheets. I just love the panko breading sprinkled on top and the perfectly fried squid in the center of it.   I've tried other sushi places off the strip and not many of them literally mean AYCE. Some will not include desserts, appetizers, drinks, but Yama did! eat your brains out people!",

Others at $18 a roll?  Methinks not.    Now - on to Yama.  We were greeted by courteous staff who kept coming back to check on us, refill our waters and bring us more beer and hot tea.  Our chef was Jun.  AMAZING!  He prepared a spicy salad with octopus and tuna that really hit the spot!  Next - the rolls.  Wow.  All I have to say is wow.  You can't help but giggle as you say, \"I'd like a Man Whore and Sex on the Beach, please.\"  The rolls are as sinfully delicous as any roll can be.  They were prepared quickly and efficiently with very fresh ingredients.     I WILL be back.  I am coming back in a couple of months and this will be one of my first stops.",

As far as rolls, it's my favorite AYCE sushi in the city, Kaya is second.  I love their special rolls: strip tease and wet dream are my favorites.  Also love the seafood salad which is raw fish slices in a spicy dressing.  Their servers always seem annoyed which is fair.  I only took the star off for their limited waiting area, not having something I wanted in stock, and for their disgruntled enployeees.  Tip is to definitely go around opening for an early lunch!   Less busy with little to no wait.  Also a plus is their Desserts are all you can eat. At least my servers always give it to me.. Hmm I'll put the star back :]",

The rolls are made fresh and they come out quickly. Their service is great, never an empty water glass. Any hungry sushi lover should hit this place up. Sushi snobs may want to take a pass on this.

There are so many amazing rolls - it's neat to experiment with them!  The seaweed salad is phenomenal - I could eat that all day!    The staff was great - they picked up a plate from me and some sauce spilled on my dress, 3 staff members, including the owner came over and scrubbed my dress clean - it was quite cute actually.

Theres only one place I have tried with authentic sushi that ships their fish from japan but ill save that for another review.   Here at yama the food is good. They make lots of different rolls and when you order something else besides rolls its probably a wrap thats similar to rolls.  inside out roll.    If youre here, you have to order the seafood salad and the \"palmjob\" or handjob something like that =p. These are the only two items that stick out in my mind that I now its good...so try those! Our recent visit was not a good experience because they were closing. And when theyre closing, they also close the kitchen forcing everyone else to order so much. We ended up ordering so much also that we had to pay extra; but on the positive note we got to take the rest of the rolls home lol.  My advice to anyone that would like to try it out is to make sure you order those 2items I mentioned above and also be there before they close.",

Lots of beautiful rolls, make sure to have the 'unknown roll special #24' (one of the items you are allowed to only order ONE of from the all-you-can-eat menu.)  This place swarms, half a dozen sushi chefs somehow deftly work behind the glass sushi displays, another half dozen waiters reconnoiter the narrow-as-you-can-get aisles in a restaurant about the size of your average living room. If you're claustrophobic you might take a pass on this place.  The fish slices were generous and fresh; waiters failed to notice empty tea/water glasses but quickly took care of it if waived down.  The sweet shrimp (raw shrimp + deep fried shrimp head - another \"you can only have one\" item) was just ok as the shrimp had been fried significantly earlier.  You can order ala carte, or get the AYCE for $23.95. After tax, tip and any drink besides water you'll be over the $30/person $$ rating here.  I'd go back here, yep a fan. Glad to find good reasonably priced sushi in Vegas.  btw...the line was still well out the door by the time we left @ 9:30!",

    "text": "A couple of years ago, a friend of mine told me that this place has the best sushi and the freshest fish. Why the heck did it take me so long to finally try it?  Simply put, Yama Sushi is awesome. You wouldn't know it from the outside. It's in a typical Vegas strip mall near the corner of Flamingo and Maryland. Walk inside and it just automatically feels like you're in for a treat. The decor seems very traditional Japanese. It looked crowded, but we were seated immediately.  So how's the sushi? Amazing. It definitely lived up to expectations. We tried not to go too crazy, but I think we incurred some decent damage.  * Miso Soup * Edamame * Seaweed Salad * Seafood Salad * Soft-Shell Crab * Salmon Kama * Unagi * Ikura with Quail Egg * Yama Roll * Roger Roger Roll * Soft-Shell Crab Roll * Dancing In The Sheet Roll * Mochi (Strawberry, Mango, and Chocolate)  A definite must-order is the Seafood Salad (limit one per person). It's basically a plate of sashimi stirring in some mild or spicy dressing. I know of no other AYCE menu that offers sashimi. Pretty much everything we ordered was delicious. The only thing I won't order again is the Soft-Shell Crab appetizer. Breaded in Panko and deep-fried, it's just a little too oily and unnecessary. I'll stick with the sushi and salads next time.  I'm not sure if we got lucky, but the service is incredibly fast. Since we were only an hour out from closing time, we started marking things on our paper menu as soon as we sat down. I went out to get my camera from the car, and as soon as I got back, it seemed like items just kept coming at a rapid pace. Fortunately, I eat at a rapid pace!  By the way, at $22.95 for dinner, this is one of the cheaper AYCE sushi spots. Not by much, but it's worth mentioning.  I've said before that I'm really not that picky when it comes to sushi. Lately, I've been holding back on my five star ratings. Yama Sushi deserves a five. With fast service, delicious and fresh offerings, and a very competitive price, it just does the AYCE thing right.",

    "text": "Still my favorite place in town for AYCE. Another 5 star review, 4 years later. My last review, was just about spicy tuna, laaame.   Lunch $21.95, and Dinner $24.95. I have honestly never had a wait... even on a Friday or Saturday evening... So maybe I'm lucky, or maybe I come at irregular dinner hours (6pm... isn't so irregular) Don't worry yourself over a wait. As for feeling like a cramped sardine, yes you will be jam packed into this place. Ask for a table on the new side to the right of the bar if it is open, much more spacious.   Here's how to do it at Yama: Get a table, yes a table. I feel I get better and more efficient service at a table (waiters have notepads so you can stack your orders, while a chef only has his memory). My water is always filled to the top, sometimes I will ask them not to, and don't get alcohol unless you want to compromise your stomach's capacity for food;)   Next step is nigiri, (you come to a sushi restaurant, no cooked food here, skip the boring appetizers!) 2 pieces come with one order. If you're feeling it you can go for the seafood salad (sashimi in a ponzu type sauce, you get what I think is the left over cuts), this is a hit or miss with me. It's good, but I definitely don't come here just for that. What you must have is garlic tuna and the yellow tail.   After nigiri comes rolls. Number 7- \"sun of a beach\" is a must! A MUST. Hits every sensation and taste: hot, cold, crunchy, sweet, spicy. Yes its smothered in sauce, which \"snobs\" seem to dislike, but just get it. I am also a big fan of \"wet dream,\" its baked so it takes a little while for it to come out, and has a healthy dosage of cream cheese. Keep note, if you're feeling full but want to continue to try, you can order a half roll.  And to top it off, no matter how full you are, dessert is a must. Mango or strawberry mochi will soothe the heat of your wasabi, and creates a great end cap to the meal. Enjoy!",

    "text": "2 words: Sea Urchin. It tasted so GOOOOOOD!  I've been to other AYCE sushi places, and this is probably the best I've had so far. The texture of the Uni is soft and creamy and the portion of the sea urchin is much larger than those in other restaurants.  The specialty rolls had hilarious names such as \"Happy Ending\" and \"Man Whore,\" and they all tasted good. Depending on your preferences in rolls, there will always be something in the menu that will suit your palate.  Another highlight of this place is the dessert. Come on now, who doesn't NOT like mochi ice cream?   For those of you who are acting adventurous, I HIGHLY recommend the plum ice cream. Although the ice cream comes in different flavors such as green tea...nothing beats plum ice cream. It may seem different at first, but once you try it -- you are going to want another serving. It's sweet and leaves a better aftertaste in your mouth that far surpasses that of green tea ice cream, imo. :)  The next time I go to Vegas, I am definitely coming here again.",

    "text": "Sushi eaters listen up -  don't listen to reviews that say the sushi here is delicious/fresh/the best they've ever had. Ok? Those people are obviously mid-westerners or teenagers or something. Listen to me I'm pushing 30, I grew up in San Francisco, recently moved to vegas, grew up in family-owned restaurant for 25 years. DO NOT expect the sushi here to be \"very good\", yeah? the cold food is totally acceptable though and probably won't make you sick. The hot food is definitely alright. For a buffet, it is good.  Anyway, If the end of the meal (meaning dessert) wasn't so horribly disappointing I would have felt pretty good about my experience here.  We went for the dinner buffet. They have good hot food. For being a sit down buffet the rolls and sushi is average buffet quality, not a whole heck of a lot of flavor.  The amount of time it takes for them to come to take your order, the time it takes for them to make and deliver, and the table space makes it so that you can't overeat to the point of sickness.   weekday dinner is $24/pp (not including tax or tip), includes hot green tea, other drinks not included.   The desserts choices SUCK (ice cream or mochi, thats it). As in green tea ice cream that has literally no green tea flavor in it. Beware, the plum ice cream IS bubble gum ice cream with frozen plums in it - gross - is that what plum ice cream is supposed to taste like? Chocolate mochi was good but you're only allowed one mochi per person!!  Their desserts pissed me off.  If the owner cares to read this, which I don't think they do since this place is obviously really busy and probably has no need to change anything, if dessert is too expensive for you guys can you at least do some like creamy goji soup, or pudding, or just better quality ice cream please? Even cookies will do!  If you had good desserts you might get a 5-star from me, for sure a solid 4.",

    "text": "**** 2.5 stars ****  I feel somewhat obligated to point out right away that this place is somewhere that should be reserved primarily for locals, or more accurately those with cars here, because while you might be able to find a cabbie to bring you here getting one to take you home will likely be an ordeal, in our case about an hour wait with nothing really nearby. Yes, it is $23 for AYCE sushi for dinner, but there were multiple times throughout the meal that I found myself wondering \"why am I eating this in the middle of the desert?\" Freshness is definitely suspect here...  For the price alone this place obviously garners some well deserved attention. It's amazing that you can sit here for 2 hours during dinner, ordering as much as you can possibly fit in, and walk away paying about $30 after tax and tip. There are some items with restricted limits of one per customer, such as the uni, hamachi kama, and a few of the rolls, but my experience with those items was that you should probably skip them anyway. Stick to the rolls with the overt (re: corny) sexual references in the titles, since they're drowned in enough sauces to make the lack of fresh fish not so noticeable.  After waiting about 45 minutes for a table (with a brief trip to Albertson's on the corner for some 40's to sip on while we passed the time) we all began with some miso soup which was actually quite nice, and seeing as how we were about halfway into the \"burned out\" stage of our trip it was a refreshing interlude. Tea was served on the side in mugs so searing hot that none of my dining companions were able to lift the glasses. The little lady who dropped it off must have fingers that are numb to it at this point. We all ordered just one roll each initially, just to get an idea of the portion sizes and see what items they do best. I started with the Snow In Vegas, a spicy crab, spicy tuna, and avocado roll with red snapper, eel sauce, and sweet yam sauce on top. I ordered this based on the multiple mentions here and it was my favorite item of the evening, for sure.  The next round I was forced to play into their awkward sexual inferences and ask my waitress for a Palm Job, which unfortunately isn't as alluring as it sounds, since the spicy soft-shell crab and scallop wrapped in soy paper with a \"crunch\" just feels a bit grainy, and, to use their analogy, limp. The flavors were nice, but texturally it's an amateur job, certainly not high class. I went for the hamachi kama (fish collarbone) as a brief respite from the rolls, to some shock from my less adventurous onlookers. It was cooked mostly alright, but definitely a bit dry, and the dipping sauce on the side tasted almost exclusively of soy sauce. Eating really dry, flaky kama with chopsticks is quite a pain in the ass to be honest, so stay away from this item even if it's one of your favorite indulgences, as it is mine.  Even though I was nowhere near full everyone else was pretty much ready to go at this point, not quite up to the gastrointestinal challenges I regularly put myself through. So, I foolishly wrapped up the meal with what essentially equated to most of my negative impression, an order each of giant clam and uni (sea urchin). The giant clam was essentially just thin strips of rubber and the uni looked more like children's toothpaste than anything edible from the sea. My instinct told me not to consume these items, but I of course ignored it, and luckily I didn't get sick. The taste of each was awful, along with the texture, and only amplified when a few weeks later I had exemplary versions of both as part of the omakase menu at Sushi Ota in San Diego, perhaps the freshest I've ever eaten.  After wrapping up the meal we asked the hostess to call us a taxi van while we knocked out our dessert items. Nearly 45 minutes of waiting outside later I decided to just phone another cab company myself and they showed up within the next 15 minutes or so. I'm not really knocking Yama for being located where they are, since we are the ones who chose to go there, but you should be aware of the difficulty you'll have getting back if you don't have your own reliable mode of transportation.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite AYCE sushi place I've visited.  Buried in a strip mall off the beaten path, getting to this hole in the wall will require some planning, but it's worth it.  Instead of a buffet, servers come take your orders table side and return after you finish off each round.  This means that the sushi is as fresh as possible as it is isn't sitting out under a lamp.  As far as the food itself goes the unagi, softshell crab, shrimp tempura, and yellowtail kama are great for those who prefer cooked items.  For sushi lovers the salmon and yellowtail were my personal favorite.  Normally with these types of places there's way more rice than fish however the ratio here favors fish much more.   However if you're looking for sashami the closest thing you'll get is the seafood salad which reminds me of a spicy poke of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.",

First time was in gyoza we ate one and the second one bit into it and the food was in the gyoza. The waiter or manger who ever we talk to didn't do anything about it. All she said was \"sorry okay, would you like another one?\" That's all. The second time I found it in one of the rolls. Before I was about to eat it I noticed a hair in the sushi. And I told the waiter we found hair again and we weren't going to pay. That was twice within 10 mins. We left because I was going to pay for food that had hair. They sent 4 workers out to my car and forced us to pay. I will never come here again. It ridiculous that they didn't acknowledge the fact that there was hair in the food and they forced me to pay.",

    "text": "Boy was I a one minute man while having my happy ending after the strip tease. Nooooo! I'm not talking about Crazy Horse III. Sheeesh, thats another review. Haha.  What I'm talking about are the signature sushi rolls @ one of my fave AYCE sushi restaurants, Yama. That's just 3 of many different style of sushi rolls offered here. Love this place, and yes they are always busy, so when you come know your stuff. Learned the hard way 5 years ago when ordering taco thinking it was a japanese style crunch roll, and it ended up being an octapus salad, so yes know your stuff.   Customer service is always good, friendly staff, but because of it being so busy, they tend to forget about you at times, so maybe more friendly staff to move things along more smoothly may work.  Ambience is just right, with their expansion it evens it out a lil.  If you do happen to have a large group, they do have an area with LCD tv that can seat up to about 10-15 people. In there you get your own server, but I believe you may have to call to reserve this room.  At only $22, you can get your hands on all your favorite sashimi style, hand rolled, cut rolls and appetizers. All your favorite assortments of fish including yellow tail, salmon, tuna, uni, albacore, and white tuna. Always fresh here with a good rice to fish ratio. You are limited to some of their rolls or sashimi to 2 per person, like the sweet shrimp with fried heads or seafood salad, but when ordered with a group, well satisfying.   Overall, a great experience for that sushi craving without having to dig deep in your pockets. Come hungry, and for those busy days, come patient. Otherwise, get your sushi on at Yama.",

My friends and I did the AYCE lunch and tried their nigiri, a roll, BBQ ribs, agedashi tofu, green mussels, tempura, and their ice cream/Mochi ice cream dessert. All of the fish was really fresh and none of it was stringy and the BBQ ribs were AMAZING! I kept ordering those every time we placed and order! The agedashi tofu was good but needed a little more sauce in my opinion but the green mussels and shrimp tempura were on point! Last but not least, the Mochi ice cream - YUM!! Most AYCE sushi places don't include dessert in the menu so we were really excited for those and the Mochi tasted super fresh too! I would definitely recommend Yama if you're in Vegas and love sushi! I'm coming back soon!!",

    "text": "Came here because it was highly recommended and was kind of disappointed due to the amount of rice they put in each piece of nigiri and the service. I usually don't sit at the bar but we were starving after our Hoover Dam tour so we asked for first available seats. We sat in the smaller back room and the experience at the bar was kind of awkward. The sushi chef took a while to take our orders, and we didn't feel very comfortable listing off a bunch of rolls. He was super busy making other rolls as well. Servers would drop off order sheets and he would work on them for the tables and when he was done he would just say NEXT! to us, letting us know he was ready for our order. It took a while to get our sushi from him but the appetizers we ordered from the waitresses came out fairly quickly.   - They have bbq ribs here, which is like korean bbq ribs cut into three pieces.  - Green mussels took a while to come out, but were also good.  - We ordered a bunch of salmon and white tuna nigiri, and the chef put a bunch of sauce on top which made the rice fall apart and the fish taste kind of sour. Finally we requested them without the sauce since we weren't a huge fan.  - The albacore nigiri was great though. Rolls were also good, but I felt the fish & rice ratio here isn't as good as Sakana.  - Eel nigiri sauce wasn't very flavorful, but the eel was good! The seaweed wrapped around it made it super chewy though.  - Man whore roll was good but spicy!  Don't sit at the bar, try the bbq ribs, and order half rolls so you can try a little bit of everything!!",

    "text": "Strip Tease, Dancing in the Sheet, One Minute Man, Wet Dream...those are just a few of the sushi roll names at Yama Sushi and no I didn't make those up just now.  They have a ton of specialty rolls with very suggestive and risque names that are both amusing and very tasty!  The price per person is for all you can eat.  Less than $30 a person for all you can eat sushi is a steal in my opinion-fresh fish isn't cheap!  Their portions are pretty generous too so your money will definitely go a long way at Yama Sushi.    I was warned about the long wait time before dining at Yama because they get really busy but luckily we arrived before the rush.  We were seated immediately but when we left the restaurant, there were people waiting outside to get seated.  The food tasted pretty fresh and it was delicious-the creative sushi roll names did not disappoint one bit.  We had the pleasure of being served by Moo who was very friendly and quite entertaining.  He was quick to bring our drinks and kept the refills coming and never failed to make us laugh by making little jokes here and there.  He needs a raise for his wit, that's for sure.   Overall, I grade Yama Sushi and A for price/value, food, customer service, location and parking.  They're located off the Las Vegas Strip in a small shopping center with ample parking.  If you're looking for a good all you can eat sushi joint and need a break from the busy Strip and gambling, I recommend giving Yama Sushi a try!",

So don't think about sitting there and talking to let your food digest in order to get more like you do at a buffet. Overall the food is good. If you don't eat all your food they will charge you for it which is a good way to cut down on wastefulness.",

We tried a few appetizers. The Ribs and dumplings were fine. But the teriyaki chicken was terrible. It looked like a filet that had been microwaved and then covered in a sauce. This piece of meat didn't look like it had seen a sautee pan.   As far as selection, it was fine. I think our favorites were Strip Tease, Fish & Chips and I enjoyed a basic avocado Roll.   The service was slow, which made ordering frustrating. We probably won't be back.",

It takes some time to digest the sushi menu as it is extensive.  Tough job to decide what to grind first!  The combo bentos are average and tend to come out semi-cold.  A couple of us ordered combos and the tempura was cold and the beef \"steak\" was more like Teri-meat sticks you get on the side with saimin(thin and over marinated).  The best non-sushi is the Beef Sukiyaki - wow, lots of stuff and very tasty(pic). Great place for groups to grind on sushi and beers(good selection of Nihon beers).",

Their rules are simple - order 1 at a time, don't eat just the fish and leave rice, don't share rolls, and no left overs. We had their One Night at Yama, You the Man too, Who's your Daddy, Spicy Sexy Roll, Man Whore, and one more roll. All of them were super delicious. They do give you a ton of rice with sushi.  Drinks: The menu offers soda, water, beer, wine, and sake.  Service: We felt well attended the whole time we were here. Good service!",

This place was recommended to me by a few friends, and I'll admit I was a little hesitant when we showed up around 5 or 6 pm on a Friday and saw it was relatively empty. That being said, it seems we actually came at the perfect time because it started to get packed around 7 or 8 pm.  I honestly can't remember what rolls we ordered, but they were absolutely delicious. I really liked that their menu had different symbols next to each item, it made it easy to order. We ordered two rolls at a time, which I found was a good strategy so that the table didn't get full with too many plates. The service was efficient. As soon as we finished one roll, a new one arrived.  It's not the best sushi I've ever had in my life, but it's definitely one of the top sushi places I've come across in Vegas. It's a great price and you're getting quality fish.   It can get pretty loud when it's busy, so I wouldn't recommend this spot if you're looking for something a bit more intimate. But it's a great place if you're craving sushi and you don't want to break the bank.",

Service is really friendly and attentive but unfortunately the sushi rice was a let down.   Sushi rice is pretty much the foundation and you come to not expect the absolute best at an AYCE spot but I just found the rice to be dry and lacking seasoning. Still, the menu is pretty extensive even for lunch and you will have a nice variety of dishes to choose from. Think sashimi and poke salads, deep fried soft shell crab and tempura shrimp, and of course lots of nigiri sushi and rolls including uni. Extra props that they are able to do half rolls so you get to try more.   Again, the staff are just absolutely lovely and honestly looked dissapointed when I declined the offer for dessert. I think there are better AYCE places close by like Sushi Way but Yama is still decent choice especially for the price at lunch.",

I said table because I like my little 4 cornered-world, but ended up at the bar anyway because a table would have been a 15min wait. No thanks. Besides, the bar was full but we scored the end. I need my corners. Lol.   Sushi chef quickly acknowledged us and to let him know whenever we are ready he is. The way he moved told me he clearly is used to the busy pace. My Filipino counterparts, I do mean pace with a p. Hahahha.   Waitress and bus person were pretty quick about cleaning off our tables, refilling our water in a timely matter, and checking if we were all right without overly doing it. I can't stand when they overly cater. However, I can't say the same for the guy next to us because I swear he sat down and under a 1 minute 3 different people asked either what he would like to drink or if anyone came by to take his drink order. The first time he had to tell the waitress could he have a moment because he literally just sat down, literally. Proof experiences will vary.  AYCE pricing is pretty comparable to other AYCES. If you are a tourist staying along the strip looking for sushi, this place would surely pop up as your closest and best bet. Which is probably how they got all these reviews.   As for me, sushi wise....I wasn't impressed especially with such a rating in mind. I was simple this night...just wanted the hamachi kama (collar), garlic tuna, spicy ahi roll, and salmon skin roll.   My hamachi was wonderful! Moist and tender and did not need to dip it in the sauce it came with neither did I want to squirt the lemon it also was garnished with over it. My salmon skin roll was exactly that....thankfully, though salmon skin was not stale and chewy because I've certainly had my share of experiences of that happening.   The garlic tuna was great, but, I wish the chef didn't go overboard with the sauce causing my rice to break up leaving grains of it all over my plate. The spicy tuna was my least favorite and normally I like to order it whenever I try a new spot at because I feel like it's pretty basic. Easier to judge. Probably the 2nd worse spicy tuna I've eaten. Why?  While I understand spicy tuna is spicy....this was overly spicy. All I could taste was spice and lemon. I've never tasted lemon in my spicy tuna rolls. I ordered 2 orders of this so the spice was starting to get to me and the lemon juice they've squirted in was taking a toll on my stomach and taste buds. My husband thought I was being a little dramatic, so he started digging or shall I say helping me to conquer these rolls and he was able to realize that I was not wrong.   Oh, as for the hubs. Pretty disappointed in his uni. And if you read my reviews...the husband is almost never disappointed in food let alone uni!!! Speaks volume people, volume...lol.  We weren't able to stay as long as we normally do, but we did opt for dessert. I can't tell you what their green tea ice cream tasted like because it never came. We waited and waited...and I just go to the point that I wasn't going to waste my time asking nor wait any longer. I mean, I do have a clear idea of what green tea ice cream tastes like so wasn't a big deal. Kind of.   If you are staying or living nearby, I'd recommend them as a solid ayce. They are busy so embrace yourself in having to wait especially if you have a larger party. If you are a local, trust me...you aren't missing out on anything that your go-to sushi ayce can't so for you.  I do recommend NOT bringing in a stroller. If you need to, pray they aren't busy or plan to go to another place that is sure to accommodate your stroller(s).  Prices as of May 11, 2017... Lunch: 20.95 Dinner: 23.95 2-6 years of age half price. 7+ full price.  Hype meter...5 stars.   Enjoy!",

My favorite things to eat there are the, Spicy Seafood Salad, Harry Potter, Man Whore, Japanese Lasagna, \"Sexy\" Garlic Tuna. If you order something Sexy style it comes with a slice of avocado, lemon wedge and jalapeno  on it, AMAZING!!!!   I've never had anything bad here. Service is always great, food is always amazing and the price is so reasonable it's ridiculous.   If there is anyone that is looking for great sushi  this is the place to come. I'm promise you that you won't be disappointed with the price and you definitely won't leave hungry.",

    "text": "Never really thought about eating off the strip when we're in Vegas.  This time, however, we were there for six days and eating on the strip all those days would have made us broke.    A friend had recommended coming to Yama.  OMG, what a great idea!  Tried it out was not disappointed.  For all the sushi, nigiri and dessert that you eat here, it's so worth the 20 something odd bucks that you pay per person.  Forget eating some fancy schmancy sushi on the strip at those uber expensive restaurants in the hotels...come to this place!    The waiters were super nice and were very attentive.  We ordered so much food from their regular menu and their special menu, it was retarded.  We stuffed our faces like people who have never eaten before.   To follow, we had mochi and green tea ice cream...all you can eat!  That in itself was a plus.  I love chocolate mochi!    On the next trip to Vegas, we'll defnitely be making a pit stop here, for sure!    PS, be sure to read the fine print before you order loads of food though.  I think if you order certain things and don't finish it, they will charge you or something.  We had a couple pieces left of the rolls that we ordered and they were OK with it.  I think so long as you don't leave half a roll, then you are good to go!   Enjoy!",

Yelp may not be a dating site but it sure connected me to you! ;) i love you for 3 reasons! A. I can afford you! You're a cheap date in so many ways! You offer me not only quality but also quantity! Let's face it we all need quality relationships but A LOT of it. B.) you're delicious!  Im not one to usually order rolls at a sushi restaurants but you have many rolls i'd well i'd roll with. Your NO NAME ROLL tickles me in all the right taste buds! Finally C. I love that you offer so many tasty appetizers to excite me before the rest of the goodness comes out. It may be safe to call those appetizers foreplay. ;) You offer HAMACHI KAMA! My fav, most places make you pay extra so i thank you for that. All in all i see this relationship going places and that we're going to make it!  although i do wish u weren't so busy sometimes! I constantly have to wait for you in a line but you're worth it and at the end of the day, There's no drama for my mama either, only YaMA for my mama. see you soon my love!",

It's AYCE sushi for $23 and you can order 3 rolls at a time (which is MORE THAN ENOUGH after about 2 rounds... especially if you go with a huge group and share everything). This restaurant seems to love me because it has nearly all of its roll with my favorite, SPICY TUNA. Many of the rolls kind of tasted the same, but I loved the Mad Dragon, Happy Ending, Snow in Vegas (or something like that).. and basically everything with spicy tuna, crab (not artificial crab!), eel, and/or avocado... YUM. I would go back again and again if I could :(. PLEASE GO TO YAMA SUSHI! They even include dessert in the flat price, with varieties of mochi and ice cream.. Drooooooollllll....  Needless to say, everything was fresh and incredibly delicious.",

I'm from the Bay Area, CA and we have a lot of great Japanese restaurants out here, however in the middle of a desert is where I have had the best sushi. The All You Can Eat is no joke- I was expecting some cheaper, average rolls but the entire menu is up for grabs. The fish is so fresh it just melts in your mouth. I absolutely love the menu with the semi-dirty names! It was awesome getting extra rolls given to us by the sushi chefs alongside the amazing rolls and sushi we ordered. It was a great way to experience more fish I have not yet tried. Order the bean sprout salad- I HATE bean sprouts but I couldn't get enough! Come during lunch time when it isn't as busy. I'm telling you, if you don't come here, you're Vegas trip is not complete!!",

We also ordered two appetizers and they actually got to the table like two minutes before the lemon. We were also seated before the two couples next to us. Both of them received the rolls that they ordered before us. We ordered some of the same rolls as them. One couple arrived thirty minutes after us and still received their rolls before us. All I ordered to start off was Wet Dream and Son of a Beach. And it still took over thirty minutes to get them. The servers seemed annoyed every time I mentioned where my rolls were. This was hands down the worst service I have ever received in any restaurant. I was beyond mad when I left the place. Extremely disappointed by this place!!!!",

    "text": "I'm not exactly sure why.. but I've been craving sushi A LOT lately. This is only of any importance because I used to despise sushi. Just anybody suggesting it would result in a dirty look from me. So when a group of old friends invited me to Yama Sushi, I was actually looking forward to it.  There was about a 35 minute wait before we got seated (only 10 minutes for me & another friend because we were super late meeting up with the rest of the group. hehe.) Anyway, this was a surprise to me because it was a Thursday night. I would only expect this on a weekend; a good indication though, mind you.  The inside is pretty small. It was cramped, actually. The tables are separated by mini room dividers. I didn't mind this at all because I wasn't there to be close & intimate with anybody.. but the table next to us might have appreciated more separation from our group. We were pretty rowdy. Lol. The servers barely had any maneuvering room. I'm sure they've knocked a few people in the back of the heads before.   As any person with any bit of common sense would do, we all got the AYCE. At $23.99 for dinner, I'd say this is a pretty good deal! They had a pretty big menu. I was especially delighted when I saw BBQ ribs on the appetizers section. (I love ribs!) These were short ribs served on shredded cabbage. I probably had about 4 orders of these. So yummy! I like the fatty kind, which to me has the best flavor. They had those, along with the lean ones as well. You just get a random combo in one plate. Now on to the sushi.. honestly, I don't even really remember what we ordered. All I know was that I enjoyed 99% of it. The one that stood out to me is the No Name (#24). I remember enjoying that one the most. Everything seemed really fresh. I was looking at the ingredients and I noticed \"Crunch\" was used in many of the rolls.. and whatever it was, I liked it. I also tried the quail egg one. I was so excited. I grew up eating quail egg & I absolutely love it. But I wasn't told that it was gonna be raw.. maybe that's what the server meant when she stated, \"Oh we have an adventurer here.\" I looked at it, tried it, and let's just say that it ended up balled up in napkin.  Service was great. Up until we were left waiting for our server to check up on us again so we could order some more, only to have another server tell us that she left. Weird.. no one even bothered to let us know. Well the 2nd server ended up taking care of us at the end of the night and God bless her. She had to put up with one of our friends, who had an order of sushi left untouched. He was willing to pay a la carte for it, but she was nice enough to try and get it half off.. then ended up not charging him at all.   Overall, this place is great. I would definitely come back and recommend it as well. Btw, don't forget your desserts! Mango & chocolate mochi ice cream and red bean ice cream! Yum!",

And it stops a guest when he/she is full already. In particular, I like fish!",

    "text": "Small, intimate and loud, it's no wonder Yama Sushi was brimming with people on a late Saturday night. To bypass the traffic, my friend and I decided to reject the tables and plopped at the busy bar. The food was quick and portion size was generous, but the execution of the rolls left me with that \"oh god, I need to run ten miles and eat only broccoli for the rest of the week\" type feeling. The sushi rolls are blanketed with vile spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce; which is too bad because the rolls were nicely done. I did my best to scrape out the greasy mayo, but my efforts seemed futile. By the end, relics of mayo and rice can be seen on the plate. Not to be rude in front of sushi masters, I gulped those mayo bites down with the help of green tea. At least the spicy taste stayed intact. My friend's nigiri was fresh and proved that fish is better simple. By the end of the meal, my body was filled with jealousy when I saw patron's sashimi salad with a slaw of radishes. Damn. Curse my wandering eyes for skipping the salad section.  For $22.95, this AYCE is one of the best deals in town. Servers were on point: checked in moderate intervals, refilled drinks, and handed out check without any rush. I just wish the sushi gurus were more pleasant in the beginning, but were great overall. I'll probably be back again to dabble in other rolls and salads. And request easy on the sauce.",

Like others have said, it's not the best bet for the best sushi, but if all you're looking for is to go out and chow down on an all-you-can-eat special and you're nearby, there's really no better choice.  It's definitely better than Sushi on Trop for both sushi and other dishes like bentos and the like.  Their salmon teriyaki here is great.    The service is always quick and friendly, and if you become a regular they treat you like one.  It's not in the best strip mall ever built, but it makes the quality a little bit of a surprise.

Its an order as you go thing which ensures things are fresh.  I also like that it included nigiri. Another cool option was the 1/2 roll option.  That allowed us to try almost every roll on the menu.    This place has ruined me for other sushi restaurants. For around $25/person you can get over $75/person worth of sushi. And for the non-sushi eaters in your group the \"buffet\" comes with non-sushi food like BBQ ribs, soft shell crab, and teriyaki.",

I've heard amazing things, and I'm sorry to say this is my first negative review on yelp because of how disappointed I am with Yama Sushi. When we got there the appetizers were amazing.  My boyfriend usually orders about 10 orders of sushi, no problem anywhere else we go. At Yama, he could only manage to order 5 because the service was so bad. Our sushi chef was rude, and very blunt. Not once did he greet us or smile, and he made us feel like we were just another number. He made the guys next to us feel welcome and smiled but when he would turn to us, he gave us another face. I just feel like you should make everyone feel welcome and appreciated, not just your regulars. Then when it came to dessert, I ordered a chocolate mochi. I received a mochi, that seemed like it had been cut with a knife someone else used prior to cut something spicy. So my mochi tasted like it had hot sauce on it. It was gross. That alone makes me question how unsanitary that place must be. All in all, the sushi was below mediocre. I've tasted better sushi almost anywhere else. Sorry to say, I won't be back. :/",

    "text": "Okay, here is my problem with this place - The waitress's are pushy & the wait can be insane.   The last 2 times I have been there, I have had issues.   The first, it was just my boyfriend and I, we were doing the AYCE. Just like most sushi places that offer that, if you don't eat a majority on the plate, you have to pay for it. Okay, well we ordered some of our favorite rolls, like Sun of Beach and No Name. After we had a 3 rolls, we were still a bit hungry. The waitress said she suggested a particular roll. She brought it, but also brought this seafood salad. It was basically large chunks of meat in some sort of thin sauce. It was gross. I don't mind sashimi, but my boyfriend hates it. I only ate the pieces of tuna and shrimp before I couldn't stomach much more. The roll she brought us, was also so-so. So we finish the roll, and pretty much assume we are going to have to pay for this salad thing. In the meantime, she brings us ANOTHER roll. By then we told the waitress please no more, we are full, and we would not like to pay for these items. She was a bit taken back but was willing to not charge us for the other roll we did not ask for, and the seafood salad.   Second visit, we had a group of 6. It was a Saturday, so we knew the place would be packed. They don't take reservations, regardless of how many people are in your party. We got there, they told us 45 minutes. We waited outside with a bunch of other people, an hour went by, and still not called. In the meantime, one particular table was called on but they said the rest of their group had not shown up. So they put them ahead of us, instead of the back of my line. My opinion is, if your friends are an hour late (cause that's how long they were waiting) you should have to get in the back of the line with the rest of us. But anyhow, 2 hours went by, and by then we were becoming extremely annoyed. We took a cab there, so we figured to just wait it out. After 2 hours and 20 minutes, we got a table. The food was good and my friends were super excited about it since they've never been to an AYCE sushi joint.",

The quality of the fish was not bad, but you can definitely get fresher stuff at a more traditional place. My favorite roll was the rainbow roll with big pieces of tuna, salmon, avacado and shrimp.  The thing that sold me about this place was that it has an all you can eat option. You can order as many rolls as you want for around $23. That means that since most rolls cost in the $10 range, if you eat two rolls, you basically get your money's worth. Between my friends and I, we had eight rolls.   It certainly is not the best sushi quality in the world, but for the price, it can't be beat!",

Their sushi is fresh and tasty and the employees are friendly and helpful. I liked how the sushi chefs knew little English but were eager to help and get us whatever we needed.   They have an all-you-can-eat deal for $19.95. I don't know if it's for lunch only or dinner as well. My friend and I quickly hit the $20 mark without going with the all-you-can-eat deal. The chef noticed and asked if we wanted to switch over to the all-you-can-eat deal. Nice of him to do that.   I had a few pieces of sushi (salmon, smoked salmon and tuna roll) along with sushi salad. It's a salad with strips of tuna, salmon, octopus and yellowtail mixed in with some bits of spring lettuce mix and a spicy mayonnaisey sauce. At $6.95, it's a bit expensive but good.   They have a long sushi bar and a bunch of tables all around. Nobody seems to be in a hurry here so relax and enjoy yourself. I have only been here for lunch so I don't know how it is for dinner.  This place is worth the drive if you need a rest from the crazy strip.",

We ordered four disappointing  orders of Hamachi among some appetizers and rolls. Avoid the fried chicken pieces appetizer - very fatty. The only thing that tasted exactly like I thought it would was the edamame and mochi - that's not saying much!",

    "text": "Previously my wife and i had been living in the town of Lancaster in California, while there we got addicted to an all-you-can-eat sushi bar called Big Tuna. Best place we have ever been, excellent sushi, excellent service, excellent ambiance. Since moving to Vegas though we have been searching and searching for a place that comes close to matching it, and while we have not yet found such a place we both agree Yama Sushi comes decently close.   The sushi is well made and comes to you fairly quickly. While we have been to some locations where the sushi comes back to us at room temperature (ick) the sushi here is still nice and cool. My personal favorite is the garlic tuna, while my wife's favorite is the baked green mussels. The rolls are all pretty good, we have yet to find one we didn't really enjoy, though I do suggest being careful with anything that has cream cheese because it can be overpowering. Oh! And it is all you can eat desserts as well! Love mochi? Get as much as you like!  Downsides? I hate it when you order a soda and they give you a can, especially at an all-you-can-eat place. I generally just stick with a water then. Also, sitting at the bar for any real length of time can be murder on your butt, but it is the best place to be for the all-you-can-eat sadly.   All in all this is the best place for sushi my wife and I have found in Vegas so far, and we have tried quite a few. Don't go towards closing hour and it should be a excellent experience!!",

It takes a lot of sushi to fill me up and frankly I could never eat till I am full at a non ayce and pay the bill. Well I mean I could, but I wouldn't want to. Anyway, one of my fave items is the seafood salad. The way I discovered it was one time I went alone and sat at the bar and the chef asked me if he could make me something. I said sure, and I am given the most delicious seafood salad ever. Everytime I order it is different, I guess it depends on the chef who makes it. It never disappoints.   The staff is friendly and always comes back when we are almost done with our order to see if we are ready for the next round. My water glass is always full, I don't like to order soda because it fills me up too fast.   The must try rolls are Strip Tease, Son of the Beach and baby one more time. I also like the harry potter roll and their selection of nigiri is great. Smoked salmon is so tasty.   Next time you find yourself in Vegas and you are craving sushi, visit Yama, it is worth it.",

Coming from LA, I consider myself somewhat of a sushi elitist.  Although the quality of the fish here is mediocre, the prices here are unbeatable in Vegas.  The AYCE also includes all hot foods including teriyakis and tempuras.  The only drawback here is that the service is extremeley slow on busy days (which pretty much means every day).  Be sure to try their uni, albacore, and sweet shrimp (although the uni and sweet shrimp are only included ONCE in the AYCE).  With the benefits and drawbacks, I would rate this place a solid 3 star.  PROTIP:  Be sure to try the seafood salad; a mixture of sashimi slices in ponzu sauce and sliced radish.",

Unlike other reviewers have mentioned, I did find my fish (at least this day) to be good. I also appreciated that they let us order half rolls. This gave me the opportunity to try a variety of different rolls. I also like that the menu has pictures of most of the rolls which makes it easier to visualize what you are getting.   The appetizers I ordered where just ok. The shrimp tempura was super oily and the sauce it came with was watery and flavorless. This is something I would def not order again. I did try the cucumber salad and chicken katsu and these items were ok. The cucumber salad was super simple but it cleaned the palette to try new flavors.   One thing I wish was a bit different is the way that the food is served. I was in a table with 6 other people and more than one order came in one plate. This meant that we had to move plates all over the table to get our rolls. It also lead to a lot of confusion since we weren't sure who ordered what and we had to guess the name of the roll. Multiple times we ended up eating someone else's order thinking it was ours.   I did like the fast service. Even though the place was super busy, the orders came quick. I had fun with my friends and ended up enjoying some saque.   This is not the place for an intimate date or a place to come with large groups. It is however a place to come and enjoy good sushi!",

    "text": "I personally beleive that this AYCE place provides the best bang for your buck. Its a little small and can get crowded, but its worth it.   With smaller portions of rice with the nigiri sushi, you are able to enjoy more FISH before you find yourself stuffed. With most places, they have larger rice portions and smaller fish portions- Yama sushi does the opposite with smaller rice portions and slightly larger fish portions.   I also personally like the atmosphere, I like that its kind of a small place and it's got a traditional japanese interior design which is a nice touch. Occasionally they update the backdrop picture at the sushi bar to match the season.",

Today we got seated on a cramped spot near the cashier, our food took forever to get to us (it wasn't even busy), and after our first order it took forever for someone to come by our table to order again. Not only that, but in the middle of our meal we saw a small cockroach crawling to the wall beside our table. We instantly lost our appetite and couldn't finish our food because of that. They gave us a small discount because of that but it's still not worth it. We were even looking forward to having some good sushi but it was all ruined because of that cockroach :/ Now they lost good customers because of their lack of cleanliness and efficiency.",

Both were incredible. I think the best rolls I've had. The flavor combinations are perfectly unexpected and oh so good. The rainbow roll had little sections of lemon that gave each bite a burst of bright tartness to compliment the ponzu. I only wish we could eat more! The Mad Dragon is the first spicy tuna we've had that is actually spicy. It's got sweet eel sauce to pair with the spice making it a joy to taste.   Also noteworthy is the excellent service. Every server is vested in your table. We never wanted for a refill, a smile, or divine sushi. The name-tags of servers are just funny. We had great giggles over 'don't remember'' The menu is filled with slightly provocative names...starting us out with a good laugh. The rolls themselves did not disappoint.  We will be back, even if we have to make the hour flight down!",

The wait staff is pretty attentive, food comes out at a steady pace.  Yama also has a wide variety of menu items which is a plus, if someone in your party isn't in the mood for sushi/raw items. I'm more of a nigiri type person, so that's what I pretty much stick to, but a few of their side dishes are also worth getting.  This is one of the favorite AYCE spots among locals and can get very packed, so be prepared to wait if you plan on dining here. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu  3.75",

I'd say for the price it's still decent.  The food and service overall has taken a dive.  Now they have another location.  I dislike that one too.  I can't say I'll come back to Yama.  The price and distance no longer peak my interest.  Just go the other better rated places.  I dislike how often places get 1 stars and 5 stars but in this instance, you're better off staying away from here.  This old property hasn't done much to keep it's standards and service up.  Nothing has changed the past few years, so the only reason it's still around is because people are too lazy to find other spots!  Just do a bit of Yelping and find brand new, cheaper, and better tasting sushi joints around the valley.  Don't be a casual sushi goer and getting your money taken.  There are so many other places and dishes that can be tried out for the same price!",

I've had a number of AYCE sushi in Las Vegas but tried Yama Sushi based on Yelp reviews. There was a wait area is very small but the entire restaurant is also small. The restaurant is out dated and it does not look like they maintain it well. I overlooked this because you should never judge a book by its covers! Maybe I should have though. The service was terribly slow. They had one individual taking drink orders but you had to wait for another individual to take your sushi orders. I would advice ordering what you want because it took nearly 35 minutes before we could submit our next order. They do allow half orders for some items so be sure to ask! The sushi quality was okay. I ordered salmon nigiri and was afraid to order more and possibly get sick because the quality wasn't the best. Some of our rolls were never brought to us and when we would mention it, we were disregarded. They are good with clearing the tables for you, but it doesn't matter when they won't take your order so you can eat more! I would definitely not come back.",

I walked in on a Wednesday night and was surprised that it was crowded.  Sat at the bar and it really took forever to get an order in with the chef.  You can't ask the chef to make you things either because there are 4 other customers waiting for the same.  Since it took forever for orders to be taken, my stomach had more than enough time to settle in from the first handroll and I couldn't eat much.  Also a small gripe that the chef's ?friends? came in later and he made rolls for them first.  \"hola chicas\"  The handrolls were disappointing.  Compressed rice (or hard rice?) with a sliver of yellowtail.  Probably the worst I've seen in Nevada sushi places.  The other rolls have too much sauce on them.  If I have to recommend, get the \"Seafood Salad\" and I liked \"Happy Ending\"  Tea cups went empty.  Went to a CVS store next door to buy water after the meal.  Like I said, it's not a bad place.  Just after going to Goyemon, Jjanga, Sushi Pier... I don't see a reason to come here.",

    "text": "I've been Yama numerous times and never really been a fan. It's been about 3 years since my last return until recently.   First off, the place grew in size. I think they rented out the place next door and connected it so now more people can be seated at one time. I remember it being to tight and compact. So that was a plus.   We ordered the spicy rolls and boy they were spicy. I really enjoyed the different rolls that were ordered but the rice was just too much. The fish portion did match the rice but I think there was way too much rice for me. The same goes with the nigiri. There was too much rice with it. I didn't think the fish was very fresh. It was very bland not much taste.   Worst part of the meal.. When I was eating my seafood salad (which by the way was a bunch of large cut up fish not much going for it but that) I found a fish bone! I have never in my life found a fish bone in my sushi until today. I just couldn't believe it.   Staff was nice and attentive. Food came out in a timely fashion but with many sushi joints in town I probably will NOT be returning.",

I have to say, I absolutely love this sushi restaurant. It's my go-to when I haven't had a single bite all day and great for catching up with family and friends!  A couple perks about this place is first the price. I always come here for AYCE and they offer a lunch and dinner price. Lunch at $21 is nearly a steal and super easy to break even. Even the dinner at $26 is great for the added menu items! Another perk is that Yama Sushi offers military discount for those who provide a valid ID (I use my CAC). Great for knocking off a couple dollars off the AYCE price.  The food is SUPER delicious. I've been to other sushi restaurants around the city, and I always find myself returning to Yama Sushi. Even the sushi restaurant across the street can't compare! All their seafood is almost a fresh curation; a few of my favorites are the Wet Dream, Yo Sexy, and No Name!  Sometime in the last two years they did expand the size of their restaurant, so that they're able to cater to bigger crowd, and their service is usually spot on every time I visit.  Definitely recommend this place for first time visitors! I'd say it beats any sushi restaurant on the strip!",

I only give it four stars because we always end up waiting at least 30 minutes when we go.  They've expanded by adding a second room, and it appears that they are working on opening a larger location; hopefully this resolves the issue.  I love that they have an all you can eat option.  They have large rolls, and they all taste different.  A lot of places serve the exact same roll and just switch around the order of the ingredients.  At Yama, you get unique roll options.  Our favorites are the No Name roll, the Wet Dream, and the Yo Sexy.",

Let's get to the food! Everyone in my party decided to get the AYCE while I got the Chirashi Bowl. Maybe I am just super spoiled that I get in my hometown that theirs seemed, underwhelming. The tuna that my friend got wasn't even red, it was almost brown. How could a place this busy not have fresh fish. The food took forever and the wait for the AYCE was quite long and my friends and husband weren't very impressed as well. I was a little disappointed. Maybe it was just bad night?? They must have long lines for a a reason. I probably will be trying a different sushi place next time.",

    "text": "When you get a hankering for some sushi, you ultimately know it is going to be an expensive experience. However, there are some spots that offer an all you can eat (AYCE) experience that can runs the gamut of being good or downright terrible. While the service is a bit interesting and the ambiance somewhat confining, their well-made sushi rolls more than make up for its shortcomings and keep me coming back for more.  The menu certainly offers your normal menu that you would expect along with their special rolls that define a sushi establishment. The chef specials are amusingly named and certainly offer an array of flavors. The man whore roll was interesting with a spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and cream cheese and certainly a good starting point. The wet dream was alright but essentially a california roll, while the Son of the Beast was certainly a good offering of sweet and savory, spicy and mellow. The fresh fish was pretty good and well cut, while the rice was nicely rolled.  Service was reasonably attentive and water glasses rarely went empty while the sushi arrived in a nice progression and the wait wasn't too excessive. I'd suggest ordering more when you have a roll left on the table. It certainly was loud and a little rambunctious, but I think that was part of the charm.   Tables are rather close together so you might be overhearing the table next to you. Probably not a good idea to discuss a business merger or chat about the insider stock tips you got.   Plan to make reservations otherwise you might be in for a wait. We waited about 20 minutes for our table, which wasn't too excessive but we didn't go on a peak night either. You'll thank me for my suggestion when you wait in the 105 degree heat.   All in all, you definitely get a good value for your money and definitely one of the better options for affordable and good sushi.",

Lots of fun rolls, and very pleasant service.  So why only two stars? A gnarly black hair found its way on to my husband's nigiri. Not even ON to, but under and almost around. He discreetly showed the waitress who took the plate away. So discreet that the other 5 of us didn't see it, hear about it, or notice while we finished what we were eating. But then, a manager ( I assume) came back and in very accusatorial tone said \"I just don't know how this would happen.\" And then proceeded to describe the hair of the chefs and wait staff. She was kind of pushy about it. And this got the attention of the rest of our table and other tables. The one piece of nigiri had the hair looped under it and sticking up. My husband noticed it when he ate the first piece and the hair on he second piece moved into view as most of it was pinned under the rice. Disgusting.  It wouldn't have been a big deal, except the manager was rude about it. We don't know how it happened either lady, but it did and no we don't want it anymore.",

All of my friends had already been to it without inviting me (uh!) so I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  Loved. It.   I went in to a fairly empty restaurant and sat at the almost full bar. My only, only complaint is that this place is so unnecessarily noisy. I don't know if it's acoustics or rudeness, but it really needs to tone down. I sat next to two of the rudest people I believe I've ever sat near. They chewed with their mouth open, talked so loud that when I took a phone call my best friend said she'd call back when SHE could hear ME. Bad, bad.  Other than that, the service was spectacular and the sushi was delicious. I had some albacore (fresh!), a little edamame (a little overcooked), some fiery sushi, some soft shell crab, and rols, rolls, rolls. I loved it all! I really couldn't stop eating and I'm not one to gorge generally. This place made me! I swear!  The final bite was mango mochi. Yum-my. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.   I am definitely heading back to this AYCE soon!",

If you want good sushi in vegas without the roaches go to SUSHI WAY.  Never had a bad experience there.",

    "text": "A real disappointment. If you know anything about sashimi/sushi, you will not like the quality of the food served here. I had high expectations walking in, based on raving reviews on yelp, but oh, my goodness... I really do not see how anybody could rate this place anything other than a one star.   Pros: none; no kidding.   Cons:  Ambience: cafeteria-looking set up with small tables crammed into a tiny space  Service: I had to grab a waitress after waiting 5 minutes with all these waiters and waitresses passing by our table without paying any attention. Then, after placing our first order, we find something else we want to order, but the waitress tells us that we have to wait until the first order comes out. Ummmmm.... We left 45 minutes after we sat down, and more than half of our \"first order\" had not come out. We were done waiting.    Food: Sorry, but it was unbearably horrible. They spice everything up, even white tuna, which is very telling of its freshness, or the lack thereof.  The uni was dark brown in color, and it tasted bitter, not sweet. Even salmon was mushy.  Rice is way too sticky and way too much.   I travel a lot, internationally. I have been to many, really, many different restaurants, some good and some bad. This, I would, without hesitation, call as one of the five worst restaurants I've ever been to in the last decade of my life.   Vegas has so many awesome restaurants. Save yourself a trip; go somewhere else. My family will go have dinner at another place in a bit.",

Bar sitting is a must here, you get much better service and it's not as cramped as the tables.  The fish is standard for AYCE. I usually just stick with nigiri, one of everything! I have been partial to the masago/quail egg combo as well.  For the price and location, Yama Sushi is alright. Don't go here during busy times though, the wait can be long and they want to rush you outta there.",

After convincing me to get all you can eat sushi, he told me he would not steer me wrong and I must say he didn't. Of course I did not love everything he had me try but most of it was definitely a go. Each roll he has me try, he only made me half the roll since I was just \"trying\" them out. Once I tried the Yama Crunch, that was it! I was addicted! I now crave that roll lol. The service here is always great and I must say a big THANK YOU to Paw for always giving an awesome experience and opening up my taste buds to sushi !!",

I've not head a bad experience yet and have been here on all different days for dinner... been here about 12 times in the past 2 years.   My FAVE is the Sexy Salmon... meaty, salmon with a sliver of lemon and a small slice of avo and jalapeno. YUM! My mouth does a little dance. I usually get 2 orders just for me. :)   Another FAVE... \"Belly\"... I think this is Toro... anyways... it's a specialty and I think it's extra and it's not always available. But WOW! It melts in your mouth and is the BEST piece of fish ever! Ask for it... You'll see what I mean.   Their rolls are really good and can get a little crazy with the sauces so ask them to go light and it's not a problem.   Did I mention the Sexy Salmon? Oh yea... I did... I actually crave it sometimes... but as this is not a close place to get to for me... I have to wait til the friends can get together... Speaking of which... I better e-mail them and see what they are up to. :)",

    "text": "The search continues for quality AYCE sushi in Vegas, which shouldn't make sense when AYCE and sushi are in the same sentence.  Walking in on a Sunday evening around 9 pm, and the place is pretty packed.  With only four seats left at the sushi bar, we take two of them near the end.  The waitresses got us our beverage orders and bring out a little plate of cooked bean sprouts.  And then we started ordering with our sushi chef.  First attempt - uni.  The chef looks at us and says they are out.  Oh.  (I should have gone with my gut and just left then and there!)  * Seafood Salad - One order per person, and so we got one each.  Definitely generous with the cuts of fish - tuna and mackerel mostly on a bed of cucumbers and daikon radish with a spicy sauce.  * Amaebi - He asks us if we want the heads and we say yes, although we wonder if there's an extra charge for it.  Two pieces come out, no rice.  We don't complain about the lack of rice, but wonder why only two pieces when we did say two orders.  (This item is one of the \"one order limit per person\" and we know two pieces is usually one order.)  The heads are deep-fried, but not enough as I had to spit out some of it.  When we attempted to order our 2nd order of it later on, he gives us this look and says we are trying to order more than we are allowed.  We're confused at this point, and ask him if two pieces account for one order.  He says it does, for the 'other' amaebi.  He then pulls out this plate of these tiny sweet shrimp that I would have been insulted if I got.  So, since we chose to get the heads, we got the jumbo size one (regular size in every other sushi restaurant) and that means only ONE PIECE per person.  Oh.  We continue on with our nigiri choices:   * yellowtail, albacore, salmon, halibut, giant clam (one order limit) and ikura - We're confused when we get our fish because one of them is obviously tuna - it's bright pink and you just know and plus we didn't order that.  Later on when we ask for hamachi, thinking that it never came, it points out that he did give us hamachi already, it was the pink one he served us earlier.  Oh?  Hmmm... Also, there's too much rice for the size of fish cuts he gave us.  That's never a good thing.  And with the whole mix up of the amaebi and the lack of uni, he offers us 'hamachi belly'.  This is the all white version and yes, it's good.  But this is what I normally get when I order hamachi at a nice sushi restaurant.  So, I still don't know what their version of regular hamachi looks like!    From the appetizers, we got softshell crab (I wasn't particularly fond of their batter for this.), agedashi tofu (pretty good with an enjoyable batter), and hamachi kama.  One thing for certain was that things coming out of the kitchen were super hot, so watch your tongue!   We're not big on rolls, and perhaps this is also why we weren't as impressed.  They are known for their rolls as many yelpers mention, and since we didn't focus on their strengths, we weren't as pleased.  Their saving grace is that there's no limit on dessert!  Unlimited ice cream (green tea, red bean, and plum) and mochi ice cream (vanilla, strawberry, mango, and chocolate - although they were out of vanilla when I went).  Service - the waitresses do come often enough to clear dishes if you put them on the side, but don't bother if you leave them in front of you.  I did have to request more tea, so it just depends.  Our sushi chef wasn't the most personable, which set the tone for our dinner.  He was hollering at us from the start, and plus, I couldn't understand him either.  Like another yelper mentioned, we were the only other Asian people there (besides the staff), so if that makes a difference to you.  And it gets loud - as in you can hear the conversations of people from across the room - not sure if it's the people who are loud or the acoustics of the restaurant.  Yama Sushi is definitely one of the cheaper options for AYCE sushi (Lunch $19.95/pp or Dinner $22.95/pp) in Vegas, but we'd rather pay a few bucks more for a better experience.  We probably won't be back.  2.5 stars",

Yama has all you can eat sushi, they go through a lot of fish, so it stays fresh. If they have a less than mild flavored fish it seems to go in the \"Seafood Salad\" and it is delicious! No Ankimo, so it's not perfect, but at this price, and the quality of food, and the friendly staff, it's as close to perfect as you can get. Jun is the new manager, and he runs a tight ship, keep up the great work guys!! I'm a customer for life thanks to their great restaurant (I eat here once a week and have mostly for the last year and a half) (special compliment to Agus, what a friendly, terrific chef!) p.s. it's in a terrible neighborhood, but it's worth running the gauntlet of riff raff to get in here. The only other criticism, they put too much mayonnaise on the rolls, so I've learned not to order most of them. Always recommended are the yellowtail, salmon, albacore ,and  garlic tuna nigiri, the spider roll and I enjoy the firecracker without the sauce on it. In fact, I bet all the rolls are great without sauce, I'll have to go try that today :-)",

I do not suggest dining at this restaurant with any more than 8 people at most. The service was not very good at all - almost like they had never experienced a party this large. They had asked us all to move around once we were settled because not everyone was doing all-you-can eat. They basically told us straight forward that they didn't trust our seating arrangements because they thought we were going to share dishes - which was not True at all. All others that didn't do all-you-can-eat ordered main dishes off of the main menu.   We were never given wasabi or ginger, and the waitress came back to us 10 minutes after the order was placed and told us she lost our order. We asked for pepper which never showed up. The service was very slow and at one point the waitress came over and blatently told us, \"sorry, you are waiting longer.\" Wow.   The food was decent, wet dream roll was amazing. I also enjoyed the firecracker. Everyone else that I was with didn't rave about this. They would have rather gone to a restaurant that knew how to handle a larger party. Too many waitresses trying to handle our party.   A giant disaster as far as I am concerned. Take your business elsewhere for larger parties.",

The good: On good days, they make our sushi pretty fast.. surprisingly. And they do try to be attentive with orders and requests.  They advertise on yelp that they take reservations... I dont know about that. Maybe if you were having a big party you could ask to reserve this little space they have near their entrance. I'm just guessing, I dont exactly know for sure because as far as I know, I asked if we could reserve a table when I first started going here and they informed me it was first come first serve.  Price.. It's decent. It's pretty much around the same price as other sushi places I've been at.  Service.. I'd rate it as average.  If I had to recommend a dish to try, I would recommend the sun of the beach. One of their most popular dishes. If you dont like salmon though, I'd skip on this.  I'd say if you're hungry and you want to eat right away dont come on their busy nights.. you know friday, saturday nights.. They get pretty packed. And you could be waiting for a really long time. If you're by yourself, you could probably get lucky and get squeezed in at the sushi bar... other than that, you have been warned.",

    "text": "Considering this is Vegas and it is the buffet capital of the world, I came into Yama Sushi with the bar set a little higher than usual.  We went with the AYCE dinner of course and I went straight to the good stuff on the menu. I was a little disappointed...  Only 1 uni per person... Only 1 soft shell crab per person...  *Sigh* Makes sense cause I would of dined on that the whole night. Oh well, I'll go with one of each then.   The waitress tells me that they are out of those items... WTF   So, I ended trying the salmon sashimi and mackerel sashimi along with a bunch of their rolls. The salmon was good, you can't really go wrong with that, but the mackerel was a little dry and not fatty at all.  If you are a fan of rolls with cream cheese or fried tempura then you will like Yama. But if you just like plain old fish then I will say no.  And don't let the door hit your ass on the way out... seriously, the floor is slippery as f*&k for some reason, so watch your step as you walk out.",

    "text": "As I am drafting this review, I have already been waiting 30 minutes for our order. The sushi is average (thus the 2 stars), but the sushi chefs need to get out their orders according to when they were placed.  Granted we did have a large party, our rolls still should not have taken 45+ minutes to prepare - mind you this was the same amount of time a table came AFTER us, ate, paid and left before our waiter even said something about our order. Obviously the chef was not placing the orders in chronological order, or he looked at our order of 3 rolls and 10 sushi nigiri and thought, \"f*ck it\" and then stuck it in a corner praying that it would go away. Either case - not cool.  The staff seemed apologetic enough, however they should have checked up on us sooner. When they did eventually check up on us they asked (with a puzzled look), \"you still haven't gotten your sushi?\"  Well, thank you, Captain Obvious.  Who else would have brought them to us and then quickly took our empty plates away? Definitely not the sushi chef.   Anyway, the sun of the beach roll was very good and in the end we ended up getting all our rolls, so I added an extra star for delayed effort.",

Their fish is undoubtedly fresh and their nigiri are easily on my top 3 best tasting ayce nigiri (goyemon and rainbow sushi being the other two).  The rolls are pretty good and I like that you can order half rolls.  They have my all time favorite ayce sushi bar appetizer of all time - the seafood salad.  The service I get is always friendly and acceptably prompt even on often busy days, and I'm never made to feel a glutton despite ordering as such.  All of these you get for a price less than most other ayce joints in vegas.",

The old Korean guy behind the bar makes awesome sushi at your request and always encourages you to eat more. He'll also give you suggestions. (make sure to tip them well. they work hard!)  I can't pinpoint one type of roll I like. I pretty much like it all. Of course the salmon can't be compared to say the fresh salmon rolls in Vancouver BC but for non-LA and non-Vancouver this joint is awesome. Decently priced.

    "text": "Ever had to sit at a sushi bar and not want to order sushi?  This is what happen to my sis and i as we encounter our very first hostile, sushi chef.    We came here on a busy Tues night and settled at the last available seating at the end of the bar next to a group of 6 in front of the chef. He briskly acknowledge us and instead of presenting the menu to us, he quickly dropped it with a snapping, release motion.  Just a step shy as if he were to chuck a dirty tampon at us.  My sis and I just looked at each other in appalled of what just occurred.  This was NOT a good start our meal.    By just observing the chef before we were able to give him our first order we could see clearly that he's distressed: From his body language, to pointing fingers at guests, slamming rice rolls, and even mistreating his knives.  It put us all at the sushi bar in an uncomfortable environment.  At one point we asked a server if she can put in an order for us through another chef, but she made it all the more awkward when she blurted out our order to our designated chef.  Please, lady, go super fail somewhere else.. . .  Towards the end of our meal as the restaurant was clearing up, our chef had finally captured himself as if just he made it through a black hole.  Strikingly he even made an effort to crack a joke, but under protest we were finished and already ordered our bottomless ice cream through a server. That's too bad because I was beginning to think we were growing on him.  The whole dinner was torture-some up until that point.  I rather rip ass inside an elevator full of strangers than go through that again.  I understand that everyone has a bad day, but he should've been more professional about it instead of taking it out on all of us. And since we received some pretty low grade sushi (the orders that were not lost in that shit storm) along with crappy service minus the lady that brought us our dessert, it left a sour taste to our mouth.  My sis and I vowed never to come back.  A smile will go a long way especially if the quality of your food is below standard. Thanks for our countless memories, Yama.  We had a long run, but i'll take my business elsewhere.",

Sorry to say even though the customer service was superb, I wouldn't recommend this place because the food was just lacking in quality and freshness.

    "text": "My BF and I are looking for a sushi spot to eat cuz we are on this sushi kick and have been to 3 different places within a week.  So here we are, at Yama Sushi. We came here because of the reviews. Some are bad, but most are good to great. And what do I think? Well let me explain my rating process.  Place is definitely small. Chairs are brushed agains each other and people's backs. Elbow to elbow counter seating. 4 or some times 5 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar. I did liked the island beach back drop tho. 3 stars.   Service was good. Got our waters and orders fairly fast. Dirty dishes was taken right away. A lot of servers came and ask how we were doing and was able to order appetizers off of the AYCE menu quickly. So 5 stars for just services from our servers. But sushi chefs, I give 3 stars. No welcoming gestures, just heads down making sushi and when ordered they just gave a nod.  Okay here's the real deal. If you are a foodie of sushi, like me, you will probably rate their food as 2 stars. Fish is definitely not extremelyfresh, and all the pieces where all pre-cut so that they could pump them out like a factory machine. We ordered the seafood salad. Seems like a they just put together all the pieces of sashimi fish that didn't make the cut, tossed with a pokie like sauce (no spicy, mild, or spicy) over cucumber and shredded Daikon. Not a fan of that. Order yellowtail and white tuna sushi. It was mushy. Rice is overly vinegary. It's seems like everything had a sour note to it. Soft shell crab was good, the breading was surprising crispy. So 2 stars for the food.  So, how do i feel? I didn't like that at all. It seems like they value quantity over quality. I don't know if I can even call those guys behind the sushi bar, chefs. They are just cooks that knows how to make those 20 or something rolls on the menu.  And to be honest. I would pay almost double for food that can just blow my mind when it comes to sushi.",

We enjoyed more rolls than I could count, and they do offer them in smaller portions so you can experience more of the menu. Strawberry mochi was delicious! Maybe we were there at the right time or it was just a good night but the fish tasted fresh and service was quick. However, they do lose one star because service is...I hate to say it...horrible, to the extent of nonexistent.  Very rushed, impersonal, and it did feel like they wanted us to hurry up, eat, and get out. Bummer when you're paying $25 a person. The only person who appeared to not hate their job was the busboy who was extremely friendly and helpful. But the sushi was excellent, and because of that I'll be back.",

Our server came back to ask us what we ordered - apparently the order needed to be put in again. An hour after we ordered, we finally got our first order and immediately ordered more knowing how long the first order took. Same thing - 20 mins later a different server came back to ask us what we ordered because the order was never put in. At that point we stated we didn't have another hour to wait for rolls to come out. That server said he could get some rolls out to us in 10 mins, which he did. He did his best to take care of us but it was too late at that point. We never got water refills in the over two hours we were there. We finally finished up after 11:00, without even ordering everything we wanted to because we ran out of time. Probably won't be back to this location.",

Coming from California I looked at him like he was crazy and said I don't think so... but we went and Yama sushi is awesome!   It is one of my two favorite sushi places in Vegas because 1) it's all you can eat, almost a must in Las Vegas 2) the service is pretty quick once you get seated and 3) they have soft shell crab as an appetizer. The wait can be long for Yama which is why I always put my name in and then go check how the wait at Sakana (right across the street in the target shopping center is) is. Once seated it's all you can eat for about $25/person, including nigiri, sushi rolls, appetizers and dessert. The drinks will run you about $5-10/each for sake/beer/etc.  A lot of people complain that you don't neccessarily have the same server the whole time, but I like that you have lots of people helping you - it means you get your food and drinks faster! My favorite appetizer is the soft shell crab appetizer and me and my boyfriend both love the double dragon roll. Usually I end up ordering a couple seaweed salads and then a lot of salmon and yellowtail nigiri.  You can't go wrong for the price!",

Great menu selection including uni, soft-shell crabs, mochi ice-cream, and more.  And they do bring you everything you order.  Nigiri had less rice than the fish which is how it should be.  All in all highly recommended if you're looking for sushi off the Vegas strip.",

    "text": "Attention AYCE sushi lovers: Yama has a couple of unique rolls that make this place better than most. They also have \"sashimi salad\" which is a large portion of mixed sashimi with onion & a creamy sauce or a spicy vinegar sauce! Their lunch pricing for AYCE is around $20 & it even includes uni! Most places charge the dinner price for uni, but not this one. Service is pretty good too. Every time a server walks by, they ask if we need anything. Some could find it annoying, but I think it's great that they're being considerate as I usually add something to our order often. This place can get really busy & it has small awkward spacing for seating, so I would recommend coming right when it opens or around 2-6pm.",

I had to turn on my phone brightness to look at the menu.  Review is based on food. Ordered appetizers shrimp tempura, Baked green mussels, deep fried mussels, and soft shell crab. Appetizers tasted like everywhere else so I don't mind. For sushi I ordered salmon, octopus, and tuna nigiri. Salmon is ok I can tolerate it. But the octopus and tuna was horrible. The color of tuna turned me off, it looked not fresh and tasted weird. Don't even get me started on the octopus. I ordered 3 orders of tako nigri and Hoooooollllly it was like chewing 5 gum. I get that octopus is chewy, but this was literally on another level. After about 2 minutes of chewing I would chase it down with water. It got to a point where I was tired of chewing and just put it in my mouth and swallowed with water. I couldn't order anymore sushi after that.",

The servers were rude and kept us waiting ( they were not super busy). Coming from someone who used to work in a restaurant this was unacceptable. I would not recommend this place to anyone. We were also told because we came in before 3 we got the lunch menu prices. When we got the bill we were charged dinner prices. Another excuse. Definitely not worth the money or the frustration.

Best appetizers include: the baked mussels, ribs, and the shrimp tambura! Best sushi rolls include: crazy roll, wet dream, son of a beach, and anything spicy! Enjoy the sushi! Love this place!  Also, waiting staff isn't too great, they were a little rude and slow. Finally, I ordered a Coke (fountain drink) and then later during my meal I wanted to switch to Sprite.

First off they put way too much rice that you can't taste the fish. Next, they put too much sauce with certain fishes, so much it soaked the cup if rice that was under the little slice of fish. Then we ordered 3 hamachi Kama and after 45min of waiting they came out with 3 hamachi stumps!!! See photo also posted. They should have just told us they didn't have any, or maybe that's what they always serve as hamachi Kama.  Someone needs to show the cook what a Kama is!   For the 1 star, On the positive side, if you like California rolls and other rolls they cover with ponzu sauce, sriracha and mayonnaise this may be for you.  I'm just glad we didn't have to wait more than 5 min to get a seat because there happened to be an opening when we got there.",

I am not a big fan of the location of the place, being that they are in somewhat of a dingy strip mall, but that did not take away from my experience there.  It is very chaotic in there, but there are worse problems to have - like people not coming.    The good:  The Sushi, of course.  There is a reason why this place is so highly rated and so popular.  I was very impressed with the quality of the rolls and the selection that is included with the all you can eat.  I have been to others in the valley that offer AYCE, but restrict a lot.  This place definitely does not.  - Get the Seafood Salad, which is chunks of sashimi and other delectables with some spicy mayo on it.  Very Very tasty.   I had 4 or 5 different samplings of rolls from the menu and off the top of my head, I am unable to remember what ones I got, but they were all good.  There were 4 of us at the table, and everybody thoroughly enjoyed their experience.   The not so good:  There isnt much to speak about in this area of the review.  Like i said above in the overall section:  Its chaotic, but there are worse problems to have.  I rate this place 5 Stars.  I would go back.... soon!",

Mine was a bit spicy and it definitely gave it a kick! The sashimi overall was the best! The salmon was extremely fresh and tasty. The rolls are quite delicious as well. Some of the rolls were a bit heavy in sauce, mayo, and rice. If you're going to do it AYCE style, eating a bunch of these rolls after a while may make you feel a bit queasy and the taste won't be as great.   The price for AYCE dinner is about $23. Not too bad! The place is vibrant and lively, but way too crowded! There's barely enough elbow space. Go on a less busy day to beat the long wait and congested area. You also get mochi ice cream and regular green tea/red bean ice cream if you do it AYCE style. The vanilla and strawberry mochi is YUMMY.   Definitely a good sushi experience! (:",

As per our instructions, we decided to go with the all you can eat option as my wife and I tend to eat quite a bit of sushi, The price seemed fair, and we started ordering. After just a few bites, I thought that the rolls lacked any pizzaz and tasted no better than the so-called sushi you can get at the local grocery store. I tried not to be negative so early on, and decided to order a few more items.   When my wife voiced her thoughts and had the same feeling that it all tased like grocery store sushi, i started to crack up! We eat sushi quite often and have no ploblem paying top dollar for quality, atmosphere, pizzaz and whatnot.   Do yourself and your stomach a huge favor, don't go here.

Notwithstanding my emotional attachment to Yama, I still feel that this is the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas.  The restaurant is very cozy, as they have a small space to work with. It can get very busy, deservedly so because the sushi is amazing. If I had to recommend something to order, it would definitely be the seafood salad. You can only order one per sitting because it's one of the \"special\" items on the menu. Understandably so. If I had the ability to, I'd order only seafood salads and put Yama out of business. Also, if you get the seafood salad, order it spicy.",

I found this place on yelp and wanted to try something affordable off the strip. However, immediately upon my first couple of nigiri orders, the fish and rice tasted sour! My friends ate their dragon rolls and some other sushi but no one finished their order. Even the mochi green tea ice cream was not up to par. The color was yellow (weird) and the mochi surrounding the ice cream was hard and tasted stale. How can you eff up mochi ice cream?!. We were definitely being served spoiled fish, failing to mask it with tons of sauce. About an hour after we settled into our hotel room, ALL FOUR of us got sick.  In summary: servers extremely nice, food terrible.   I warned you!",

Everything is fresh, delish, and AYCE.  -  Get 1/2 rolls to save room for variety.  You can always get another order if you like it (well, there's one or two items that are limit 1 pp).  -  Their custom rolls are all really good, and have funny names.  Don't be afraid to try them!  -  There's no time limit.  -  You can share everything you get with the rest of your party.  -  Appetizers like gyoza, seafood salad, dynamite, etc are ALL included too!  -  All desserts are also included (chocolate, vanilla, mango, strawberry mochi, and green tea ice cream)!  All in all, an excellent deal and experience for about $22pp (lunch) or $25pp (dinner), AYCE.  The only complaint my friend had one time was their very limited selection of sake.",

We are really hoping to not get food poisoning from this place.. I will never return and I will make sure to never recommend this place to anyone I know.. we did leave food because it was inedible.

No, but you don't go to an all you can eat joint for the best sushi ever.  Above par?  Definitely.  Good assortment of rolls.  I like the half roll size, so you don't get stuck with something that sucks.  Strip Tease roll and 007 roll were great.  There was a Palm something or rather that I highly recommend as well.  As a plus (and some places don't do this) but you get Mochi included.  A perfect way to end the meal!",

Though sushi places in Vegas overall seem to have an odd trend of having good reviews but being terrible quality. Bottom line the fish quality does not taste great and the rolls aren't very well put together flavor-wise. Even for all you can eat which can be notoriously poor quality I expect more and better tastes. I could buy much better food for $23 so don't get sucked into the idea that since it's all you can eat it's worth the price.

I really like to sit at the sushi bar and banter with the chefs as they make whatever you like. The quality for the price is great, very nice white tuna, great mackerel - It isn't fine dining or what have you but the quality is there. I enjoy the seafood salad that they make and my better half likes some of their baked rolls.  They make one thing in particular that is out of this world, to me at least. Hamachi Kama is so good there. Not fried, just grilled like you don't want to know. One thing to note is that it gets really busy, really fast so sitting at the sushi bar as a couple is great.  Since May, they expanded and have a U shaped sushi bar and much more seating so it might be a bit better for wait times. It is all you can eat if you want it, and well worth it.",

    "text": "Let me start out by stating that I have been to Yama Sushi 5 times and considered it a top sushi establishment in Las Vegas. That all changed within one visit.  My friend and I were seated at the bar around 11:30 am. There were maybe 10 people in the restaurant, very quite. Both doing \"all you can eat,\" my friend and I ordered about 5 items with the sushi chef. Within 45 minutes, we got 2 out of the 5 items we ordered. I proceeded to ask the waitress if we could order some rolls from her and she said no, as the restaurant began to fill up and become very busy. 10 minutes later I complained to the waitress that we still didn't get the items we ordered almost an hour ago. After debating with her, she accepted the order. 5 minutes later the sushi chef shoved a roll in front of my face, demanding me to eat. I have never felt so disrespected in a food establishment in my entire life. Not to mention, the few rolls we did get, the sushi quality was horrific. A Goopey cream cheese, and mushy fish taste stayed in mouth the entire day.  Long story short, my friend and I battled with the waitress for her to comp our meal, since we were dissatisfied with the service and did not even get our food. Why should one pay for food they did not get? After debating with her yet again, she comes back to us and offers us 10 percent off, that's when I flipped my gasket and started to make a scene. My friend yelled at the sushi chef for treating us with disrespect, and I ensured that we would not leave the restaurant without any sort of comp. We got out of there splitting one all you can eat price, but they lost more than just $22.99. They lost two loyal customers and any recommendation to any Las Vegas sushi goers.   Yama is a total disaster, take my advice and save your money by doing ala carte at a quality restaurant.",

    "text": "We were visiting Las Vegas for the first time and wanted an AYCE sushi restaurant to go to one night. I searched the web (and Yelp!) and d died on Yama Sushi due to the write ups.  We arrive on a Tuesday night about 7:00 to a full restaurant, but we were the next to be seated so there wasn't really a line. The food was good (not great)  and the server didn't really explain how the AYCE worked so we had to ask multiple questions to find out what I think should have been explained clearly on the menu - or by the wait staff. We were full when we left and the price was right .... I don't really have an issue with the quality of the food for the price. Here's the reason for the 2 stars. The table that we were given was just inside the front door - for 4 people. This table DOES NOT belong in this space and looked like it was placed there only to get more customers into the store. My wife's chair (and others in our party) was bumped many times as the other customers and the wait staff tried to manuever around her. This is absolutely unacceptable. The guy who seats you looked like he had better things to do than to be serving customers and his attitude showed clearly in the way he treated the customers. Anyway, foods good, but I hope Yama Sushi reads this and remives that 4 top table from the front door.",

This is not the first time we have eaten here as a large group, in fact we drove across town to eat here, never again. First of all my friend ordered a diet coke the waitress who happened to be the assistant manager her name was Michelle brought a regular coke when she was told that it was suppose to be diet she said well I have to charge you again for another drink. So because you messed up we have to pay for 2 drinks? Wtf? We ordered our food and in the middle of our meal she comes in to tell us all 8 of us need to move onto one table because were taking to long and she needs the other table they sat us at...now you have a 2 hour limit which is fine but we still had 40mins left on our time when we told her that she gave attitude & acted like us being there was an inconvience. Also some of the food we ordered never made it to us before she said our time was up & guess what she added it to the bill! I will never go back to this place again!",

    "text": "I had come to yama sushi about five other times and the food was always great for the price.  I recently went with 2 other girlfriends for a night out.  We all were turning 30 the same week so started with sake and beer.  The waitress service was not good but at the time we were in great conversation, it didnt really matter because we were having fun.  One of the gals we were with was a rookie in eating sushi so she she asked for those training chop sticks.  The third roll of sushi had already come and still no training chop sticks.  Mind you we had asked for edamame and it never came.  Still having a good time we FINALLY got the training sticks after asking and asking for them.  She brought 2 of them for the same girl which we thought was rude.  They were busy and we were into ourselves so we didnt think too much of it.  While the busperson was refilling our waters my girlfriend pulls a long hair that was fried in the shrimp out of her mouth. GROSS!!! after that nobody could stomach anything else and we asked for a manager.  The 2 waitresses kept giving us the run around and we waited a 20 min for someone to come over.  The poor girls were scared to call someone over.  We threatened to leave without paying because no one would come over.  One of them even tried to make us feel bad by telling us that she would get fired.  When the Chef came we told him what happened and he acted it wasnt True that the hair came out of  her mouth.  THE BUSPERSON WITNESSED IT!!!  Then he started blaming everyone.  We were so annoyed that we just wanted to leave now.  Can you belive the Jerk made us still pay for the food???  This wasnt a small hair people.  We should of just left when we were given the run around in talking to a manager.  Service Sucks all around!!!  Its too bad too cause the food was good the other times. P.S watch out for the roaches on the wall",

    "text": "I contemplated punching my sister out when we rolled up to Yama, which looks like a run of the mill sushi joint placed in a nondescript shopping center off the beaten track of the Strip. She's a NYC transplant so I trusted her judgment of good, quality sushi but I was a little apprehensive when we drove up and saw degenerate/hobo looking types wearing cowboy hats and smoking cigarettes, standing outside of Sally's (or something or other) gaming spot, next to Yama. She swore it was delicious and convinced me to ignore everything else from the outside. The area is a little run down but don't be fooled, Yama is a total gem. The sushi is...just...so freakin' good! Super attentive waitstaff who are constantly running around to see what you need. Loved the salaciously named rolls like \"One minute man\" or \"Sex on the beach\" - so Vegas! My personal favorite is the Firecracker. I must admit, many rolls are slathered in sauces but that's how I like it. And, how on earth do you beat $23.99 for all you can eat sushi??!! Total yum. And rumor has it, Yama purchases their fish from the same wholesalers that Strip sushi restaurants use, and Yama is a fraction of what you would pay elsewhere. If you're in Vegas, and you love sushi, you must go (just ignore the cheesy, mismatched decor!).",

The \"Son of a Beach\" roll is my favorite and I usually have one or two every visit. How can you beat the price and quality of the fish.

    "text": "$20 all you can eat sushi. This place is away from the strip. Came here with a big group of friends (13 people) and they put our tables together and we were seated within couple mins. Their special rolls are the best. I like how you can order ANYTHING u want off their menu (appetizers, sushi, soups, desserts) since some place only have limited selection and you can order as many time as you want. Our group ordered so many rolls I don't even remember which rolls we got. We were so full we almost didn't finish but we made sure we did so they wouldn't charge us extra for not finishing (not sure if they do but most AYCE restaurants do charge for not finishing). I like how how you can order mochi ice cream as many times as you want (strawberry and chocolate mochi ice cream YUMMY!), I don't know any other AYCE sushi places that do that. The service was good especially for a big group like ours. If I'm ever craving AYCE sushi in Vegas, I'll make sure to come back here.",

    "text": "I read the review about getting sick here but I haven't gotten ill.  When i in vegas for business I usually try to stop here a few times.  Been coming here for years and it's getting crowded. They now have these new rolls with silly names like Man Whore and Happy Ending. When they first introduced it I had an older waitress that asked with a heavy accent 'would you like to try man whore or happy ending\" I almost did a spit take \"EXCUSE ME??!!\"  I like that there is a lot more than sushi on the AYCE menu like tempura (you can order shrimp only) but my favs are soft shell crab and hamachi kama - onolicious.  One dish I would never order again is the yakitori - it was nasty. I was expecting grilled pieces of skewered chicken but their Korean interpretation is baked flat pieces of chicken that they cut into little squares and stick them on a skewer with muchrooms, green onion and white onion and it is baked just a little more and brought out luke warm, drenched in teri sauce. Mushroom tasted more raw than cooked. UPDATE Aug 2011 I'm going to downgrade my review to a 3 soon.  Last 3 visits which have been at lunch or early dinner they have not had hamachi kama which is disappointing since I also brought others with me and told them about that dish. I can see them running out if late during dinner but 3 times in a row is more a sign of them cutting corners. Quality of some items are going downhill too like the uni and dried pre made unagi that was inda dry.",

I became friendly with the owner as I ate lunch there almost everyday for 2 weeks. It was everything I was looking for in NYC but could not find there. The price was just right and the food was always prepared quickly and served and presented wonderfully. It is my local spot for sushi whenever I have the craving. I have introduced many of my friends there and they have become just as loyal as I have. Jun is the manager and he is very popular with the repeat guests. I love their food and their service. It never changes and I love it whenever it is so packed that you have to wait to get a table or a bar seat. It has become almost like family to me and I will always continue to go and support their wonderful business. They cater to the people and it comes back to them 10 fold. Their basis is to serve quickly and politely. I never once had to ask to have my water refilled. The waitresses are all so very attentive and they deserve a hefty tip every time. For those not giving them a good review, give them another shot. They never disappointed me and I have been there over 30 different times.",
