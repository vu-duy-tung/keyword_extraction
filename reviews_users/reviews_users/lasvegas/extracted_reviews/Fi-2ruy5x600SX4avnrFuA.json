    "text": "Extremely disturbed by our recent trip to this buffet, as it has always been of our favorite buffets while in Vegas, it is hard to believe it could be this bad. I rarely complain unless deserved, so here is our experience on this night. Tuesday July 28th, got to Vegas and for our first dinner we went for our first meal here as we usually do on the Buffet of Buffet (24 hours of eating for $54.99 at most Harrah's properties), arrived at the cashier at 8 p.m. after waiting in line nearly an hour, nothing uncommon about a wait for this buffet, bought our 24 hour grazing pass, then waited in line another 30 minutes for a table, only to notice the sea of empty clean and empty dirty tables that were sitting idle. I think they may not be able to judge capacity and demand timing and are having serious problems in managing the dining room. After the long wait we were both beyond famished only to have what turned out to be the worst experience ever at this buffet for myself, a meat eater and my friend that is a seafood eater. I could not find one cut of beef or lamb that wasn't tough. The turkey breast was extremely dry and the gravy was thick, it obviously had been there for quite sometime and reduced to a consistency of a near mud-like lumpy property. The meat in the hamburger sliders were so hard it bent the knife I finally tried to cut them with. I admit on this night it was busy, with the tables of diners finally filling up as staff slowly cleared away the debris left by previous diners. Simply put, never have I seen such a mess as this buffet was and stayed during our visit. There also seemed to be a lack of serving staff as there was never any rice pilaf or vegetables at the American station and the only vegetable I finally ate was mashed potatoes, they had large raw chunks of potatoes that I had to use my napkin to remove from my mouth, the Salad station near the Mexican food station (I won't do the other salad station next to the Seafood station due to fish allergies) stayed out of romaine lettuce for the longest time, the cheese or breads were never stocked that I saw and went back for repeatedly and this area was extremely untidy more so than other stations that were dirty as well.  Speaking of the Mexican station, the food here was extremely old in appearance with many patrons including myself passed on by. Most items at the Italian station were empty as well, at which point I gave up to another let down and decided to get dessert. In my opinion, children under a certain age should be assisted by adults, especially when the restaurant doesn't provide tongs or other utensils to pick up food. The children were using their bare hands to pick up cupcakes and other items and then at times even placing them back on the dishes for other patrons. The only dessert I felt safe in consuming was a dish of flan that was well out of reach from being handled by bare hands. An over abundance of anise in two items; a mystery meat that tasted only of anise and then for dessert I had flan that had an extremely strong anise taste (did they have an anise catastrophe in the kitchen this night?). BUT, the most disturbing issue of the night my friend who eats here regularly with me, was concerned about the after effects of eating seafood here. An hour after eating, a quick trip to the room was deemed necessary (you get the idea). Hoping it was a one time experience, but am afraid to go back if someone feels queasy after eating here and the food was as it is on this night.",

The food was really good for a buffet (why do people always complain about the freshness? It's a freakin' buffet, idiots!) with TONS of variety from all over the globe: Mexican, Indian, Middle Eastern, Southern, Asian... whatever corner of the world your hungry little stomach desires!  Lunch is something like $18 and dinner is $30, but if you're smart like us, you'll go 15-30min before the cut off time for the meal before and you get the best of both worlds at a cheaper price :)",

Choosing the dinner option we arrived on March 11 around 8:30pm which was shockingly busy for a week day. We stood inline for nearly 45 minutes which we thought was a bit crazy. Slightly after 9pm we were seated. The waitress was nice enough and offered us the wine by bringing practically the entire bottle and even offered to bring us different ones if we wished but failed to ask or offer that the crab legs can be heated as I ate 3 plates of the cold. No biggie but it took another guest to point it out to me.   The crab and shrimp cocktail were very good. Also I really liked the salad wedgie with bacon and blue cheese dressing. Thought it was a bit silly to just put 1 fried chicken breast into a basket though. Maybe add fries or something to it. My partner seemed to enjoy the Mediterranean section. The cupcakes were nice and all and many types to choose from but were very very dry and a bit tasteless. I ended up just eating the frosting tops off just to taste the flavor of each one I tried. The cotton was odd but was actually more tasty than the cupcakes. Sadly If I had to pay full price for this buffet I would be way more upset and its not worth it but for half off its not bad.",

    "text": "I thought the food here was unimpressive considering it sets you back 30 bucks.  Granted, this buffet has a great variety but what's the use when you don't really feel like eating most of it.    I think the food is decent but in a city like las vegas where there are so many good eats around, I wouldn't waste my time here.  LV is about splurging so why not treat yourself out to a really good meal.    Speaking from my own experience, the service and the meat dishes are descent.  I like some of the ethic foods too but most of it is pretty gross.  It's either too bland or painfully salty.  The seafood is completely inedible.  The crablegs are super salty and the fish is dry as jerky.  If you're fine with getting your money's worth eating mediocre cocktail shrimp, I guess that's fine.  As for desert, nothing is very delectable.  If you're going go off or diet or splurge on something, it should a least be really good.  The crepes are especially terrible since they premake them and only put it back on for a second to \"warm up\" (not really).    I feel like the quality isn't much better than your standard chinese buffet but just for a lot more money.  I would definitely opt for something else.",

I've been to couple different Vegas buffets and Spice Market doesnt stack up that well compared to those of Bellagio, Rio, or M. Considering they \"feature\" many different types of food such as asian, american, etc., the selection in these different food styles is really less than spectacular. The food is just mediocre and it was really hard for me to want to go back for seconds after viewing the selection of that day.  I did love two specific items offered at Spice that was very unique that I really liked. They actually offered hummus and hot flat bread in the mid-eastern style cuisine section and also offered sicilian cannolis in the dessert area. This was a definite plus in my book considering I never see these two items in any other buffets. This was a real treat in the mist of common Vegas buffet foods such as cold crab legs, prime rib, and various pasta and pizzas.  The service was really good so I have no complaints there. Will I be going back? Prolly not.",

I'm a big fan of naan (not sure if that's the right spelling, but the middle eastern flat bread), and they've got this egg-shaped kiln where they bake it fresh.  Good stuff.  Now the crab legs, which can really be hit or miss.  I've been here several times, and the consistency isn't there.  Sometimes the crab legs are dry, sometimes overly salty, sometimes awesome.  Can't quite figure it out, but I would think they would be more consistent with the crab legs.  The staff is pretty nice and responsive.  The Sunday all-you-can-drink mimosa that comes with brunch is pretty cool.  What else would you wash down prime rib and fried chicken for brunch with?",

My friend and I showed up on a Sunday evening, around 6, and the line lasted for maybe 5 minutes for entrance into the eating frenzy!  There's a wide variety of foods to choose from, such as salads, mexican, italian, mediterranian, seafood, and then good ol' comfort food.  Fast forward to my favorite part, the desserts!   YUM!  I think I ate more desserts than \"real\" food.  Wide variety, but by far what stood out was the warm brownie, that I doused with vanilla ice cream and broken up heath bar.  YUM!  This will be a sure stop next time I'm out this way, purely for the yummy desserts!",

We had heard good things about SMB from other people and we decided to break our one buffet in Vegas rule to try it.  We were excited to  it was a few bucks cheaper than some of the other buffets on the strip and offered a discount if you join the players club for Planet Hollywood.     The line didn't seem very long when we got there but it tripled well we were waiting for a table.  It was a Sunday night in March.  I can't imagine this place on a Friday or Saturday.  This made me even more excited to try it.  Why would it be so busy if it wasn't good???    It took 30 minutes to get a table that was practically in the walkway. Not very relaxing trying to eat dinner and feeling like you're in the way of traffic.  There were other open tables available I don't know why a place would seat us in such an awkward spot.  It was nice there was a card to fill out for drink orders so we didn't have to wait for the server.  We went for it and both filled our first plate up.  I was disappointed to come back and find no one had come by to get our drink order.  We started eating anyway.  We both had gotten through our first plate by the time our drink order was taken.  I was so thirsty.  This was not the servers fault.  They were clearly waaaay understaffed.  Our poor server was literally sprinting back and forth between tables dripping in sweat.  I made sure to tip him a few dollars  before we left.  I'm sure tipping isn't well practiced in buffets but I think it should be.  The food was mostly greasy fried food. Overcooked or cold and terrible quality.   Our plates stacked up next to us and no one came to clear them.The atmosphere was similar to a school cafeteria with framed movie posters on the wall.    I get that it's a buffet but when places like Wicked Spoon are only $10 more and so much better overall why would I ever come back here???  About and hour after we ate I got extreme stomach pains and felt awful.  It almost kept me in for the night but luckily the Venetian Apothecary revived me with medicine and after a few drinks I was ready to head out :)  My boyfriend felt fine* but I'm not gonna chance ever eating here again.  I've never felt so sick from a buffet.   *He didn't eat any of the crab legs or shrimp cocktail.  Maybe I should have known better.",

Sadly, Spice Market Buffet is much more comparable to Hometown Buffet than anything else. The food was all either too tasteless, too greasy, or looked disgusting. Pretty much the only food I was even remotely satisfied with is the cocktail shrimp and King crab legs. NOTHING ELSE in the entire buffet was appetizing.   Hands down one of the worst expensive buffets in Vegas. I would happily spend the extra $10-20 to go to Bellagio or Wynn's buffets.",

This is probably not Caesars Palace quality, but it's also not at that price point. It definitely matches the cost and there are enough different food items to please everyone. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of vegetarian/vegan options.   Main pros: Variety - Soup/Salad, Mexican, Middle Eastern, American, Asian, Italian, Seafood, and Dessert Carving station Pre-cracked crab legs Attentive service  Cons: A few bland food items  As a tip: Check Groupon/Travelzoo/Livingsocial, because they often run deals for this place!",

Still terrible. Different course menu, same end result. It's no wonder it's never busy.  The food is obviously drying up under the heat lamps, and none of it is fresh. You know that one dish you keep going back to? Well this buffet didn't even have that for me. The variety SHOULD be ample, but it really wasn't. The pancakes and waffles tasted like cardboard. Just wouldn't come back here again. Had better buffets for $4.99 at The Red Rock.",

    "text": "I am extremely unsatisfied with the purchase I made for Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood. I got in about 9:45 pm. My friend went to go find parking and I waited in short, yet slow line to go in. After waiting in line I showed them my Groupon they said I had to pay the tax on it. It was about 4 dollars, but I didn't have it on me since I didn't expect to pay anything additional. Usually if there is any additional fees the Groupon would state it, I already talked to them about this. FYI prepare to pay the taxes on your Groupon there.  I guess my fault for not having extra on me and leaving it in the car. Anyway, back to the buffet.  The buffet closes at 11pm. I finally went around and saw the trays were empty and the food was cold. Just like everyone has been saying...the crab legs are cold and the butter looks like lard. The employees are more occupied with cleaning, rather than making sure the trays are warm. Cold food=not happy. I was looking forward to dessert since the food selection was bare and cold, and on the site it says that they have a Crepe station. I didn't see anyone at the station. After I had other dessert and was full, I saw the lady working the crepe station come back. Too late!  To make matters worst, it was our last night in Las Vegas and we were supposed to go clubbing. Two of the friends felt too sick after the buffet and we didn't end up going :( The only thing I loved about this was that our waitress never once hesitated to refill our drinks and let us know all the selection that was available. While there I saw some girls flirting with the manager. They were given \"to-go boxes.\" Two of them flirted and laughed with he manager as the other one filled boxes with desserts. I thought it was funny so I snapped some pictures. I don't want anyone to get in trouble, so I won't post. I asked the lady at one of the stations if I could take my cupcake and she said no food is allowed outside. Just a FYI- If you are with your girls I guess you might want to try your luck!",

    "text": "I actually thought this buffet was the best one out of the three that we ate at (Rio's Carnival and Le Village Buffet included). We got here around 4:45 PM on a Saturday, which was super early as we had just eaten at Paris only five hours beforehand. But there was no wait at all, so we strolled through the line, got a table, and sat there for awhile before we got food. And pretty soon ten minutes later, there was a super long line! Talk about good timing. :)  The stations are pretty similar to the other buffets - Prime rib, salad, Asian, Italian, Seafood, Dessert, etc. They did have a Brazilian barbecue of lamb or beef off of skewers. That was pretty good. And yes, they had the crab legs. The only difference is that here, the crab legs are cut in half for you so you don't have to dig for the meat. So be prepared for the long lines. I stood behind a lady who took her time picking out all the crab legs ... and then she turned to me and said \"my dinner...\"   The clam chowder soup is good, and the prime rib is better than the other two buffets - very tender and delicious. Pretty worth it! I loaded my plate up with veggies - very fresh and the salad was crisp, too. The pizza, eh looked quite bad as if sitting there for a long time. They had some fried shrimp, I believe which was tasty.   The best part is the dessert! I think they also have a crepes station, but after the not so good crepes at Le Village, we decided to skip it. They have upside down cake with strawberries, chocolate cake, tarts, chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee, cotton candy. I loaded up on the desserts and ended my meal with cotton candy - which was uberly sweet. And I also drank milk as my beverage. And feasted on some more creme brulee - which was not as good as Le Village! Not such a good combination with the prime rib, crab legs and whatnot and I ended up getting an upset stomach.   But! I really liked this buffet and the overall ambiance. The noise level is quite low and there are lots of booths/tables to divide up the room to give a more private sort of feeling. Don't forget to tip your server!",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying I'd rate the food 4 stars but 0 for customer service. This place has an insanely long line during dinner. Just when you get all excited and pay, and just when you think you're finally going to get to eat....BAM! Another long line just to be seated. On this second line they basically seat you the way they like, even though you're first in line they can pick anybody that behind you based on party number. Maybe if my husband and I had 4 imaginary friends we could've sat sooner instead of having like 4 different groups that were way behind in line, get seated before us. I can definitely appreciate that all the food types visibly  labeled throughout the buffet but this layout made searching for good exhausting. I practically didn't realize there was an entire other half of stuff available until my husband kept returning to the table with new items that I had misssd. When we finally sat at our table I was on my second plate before a waiter finally showed up. He showed up while I was chewing my food and noticed it was taking me a bit so he decided he was going to continue to a different table.  This just about pissed me off and I had to flag him back to our table. After this initial encounter he never came back to check on us. Upon leaving we noticed a multitude of  vacant tables with yet still a long line. The ribs, fruit tarts, paella, and several other food Items were the jam. I am hesitant to give this place a second chance. Sadly, terrific food does not make up for piss poor customer service. P.s...did anyone figure out where the ketchup was? There were like 3 different bowls of marinara sauce but not one for ketchup?",

The food was decent, although the cold foods got warm rather fast after putting them on your plate and the warm food cooled quickly as well. The setup of the buffet or the seating arrangements could be organized better. The tables were small, with hardly any room for your empty plates. There are a few blind corners when walking the buffet line, so I almost ran into somene at least twice. The reason they're getting a better than average score is because of our drink server. My boyfriend got the unlimited alcoholic drinks for $12.99. Our server, whose name I didn't get, but it started with a T, was pretty attentive, offering an extra champagne to me before our exit when I didn't get the alcoholic drink bundle. He even let us leave with the champagne. Cool!",

    "text": "The worst experience at a buffet I've had in a long time, from beginning to end.   The girlfriend and I visited because we had a Groupon (probably should have been the first hint) and and we didn't feel like cooking. We read the reviews before we bought the Groupon. I just thought the bad reviews came from those who were a little too picky (I was wrong.) So we went with a clear mind, willing to give this place every chance it deserves.   Service (scale from 1-5, where 5 is excellent) - 1  We arrived, and walked up to the cashier. Boy, she must have been having a bad day; not the attitude I expect from a restaurant. No smile, no hospitality whatsoever. Kinda made me feel like I want wanted there. Anyways, I got over it, we stood and waited for the host to show us to the table. Her attitude was not much better. Ugh, not a good start. We waited about five minutes before our server came and took our drink orders. I swear, there must be a theme to this restaurant or something. She looked like she was barely tolerant of our existence. Expected so, the worst service I have ever experienced. We hardly saw here throughout the dinner. Even when she saw us waving her over, she would ignore it.   Food - 2  Now let's get to the food. Oh...the food. The only thing that was good there were the crab legs, the shrimp cocktail, and the charcuterie. That's because you can't really mess that up. Everything else was just downright bad. The prime rib was completely overcooked and tough. The baby back ribs were overcooked and hard. The bread they served were rock hard. Pretty much nothing in their hot stations that we had were very appetizing. We hate to waste food but sadly, most of the plates that we got were full when they took it away. We read that the saving grace is the dessert station. Not necessarily. Well, they do have frozen custard, which is the best thing there. They also have a Macaron cookie which was done pretty well. They have maybe ten varieties of cupcakes, and are way too sweet in my opinion. The fruit tart, stale. The crepes in the crepe station are pre-made packaged.   Value - 4  I give this a four given that the deal was from Groupon; $35+ for two people, alcohol included.   All in all, a pretty horrible experience, which prompted me to leave a review. I think they should seriously look into the service part of the establishment. It can make or break an experience, and on this occasion, it shattered it beyond repair.",

The one problem that I was that my boyfriend added on the all you can drink (wine, beer, etc) option. We each ordered a beer (he was brought the wrong one, but just decided to drink it), his second he finally got the one he wanted, but this is where it went bad. He went to get another plate of food so I ordered his 3rd beer for him. It took 30+ minutes to get it which included being brushed off at the cashier station and then having to get the manager involved. The manager said he would talk to the waitress, but no real action was taken. I never went back up to try any of the deserts because I was at the table hoping we would get our drinks while he was having to actually leave the table to get served. I even contacted them when we got home and was told that they would give me a priority reservation the next time I went to the buffet.   My advice is if you eat there do not add the all you can drink option. I don't know if they only want to allow you to have 2, then they should call it $11.99 for 2 drinks. I am sure people would still order that.   There are a lot of options in Vegas so I will not be returning to this buffet. I may never stay at this hotel because of the level of non-customer service that we received which is a shame because it was an option for our upcoming trip.",

The Spice Market Buffet looked especially fun since it featured your basic global cuisines.  At the salad bar I stocked up on grilled bell peppers, asparagus, brussel sprouts, olives, and other veggies that were not very memorable. Next I perused the Mexican food bar in hopes to top certain veggies with guacamole. Unfortunately, the guacamole looked sad, grey, and machine processed.  The Mid-Eastern bar looked much more promising while I filled my plate with hummus, dolmas, tabouli, pita, and if I remember correctly, some kinda of zucchini dish.  Overall, I was glad that there was a sufficient amount of options for me. However, all of it tasted as if these options were after thoughts. Nothing very exciting here. To top it off, the staff all had this \"FML\" attitude about themselves. From the cashiers to the hostess to the servers. Geez, get a better job if you all hate it so much.  The next day we went to Le Village Buffet at Paris which was way better food, service, and atmosphere. It made The Spice Market Buffet look like a Sizzler.",

Don't expect Bachannal quality food but my 4 stars is purely for the value with the groupon as we were both satisfied.  Unlimited bottled Coronas and Heineken plus champagne...that was worth at least $10 by itself...so on the other $10 I spent of the $20 I got:  Split snow crab legs shrimp cocktail prime rib (ehh..) Indian style skewered lamb (good) Some quesadillas from Mexican section with guac & salsa Creme Brulee Strawberry and creme Crepe  Considering we kept rotating mostly between king crab and shrimp cocktail while drinking all we could, the groupon was definitely worth it and we both left feeling we had a decent meal for a great price.  Our waitress, Rose was excellent, friendly and provided great service.  I would definitely come back again with a groupon offer and hit the same items.   TIP: Afterward you can hit the sports book close by and watch some sports to settle the alcohol before driving home if you are a bit wasted walking out...caught some Yankees and NBA playoffs.",

Pros:  There is a pretty good medi-eastern section, which had some tastyoptions (kebabs, rice pilaf, baklava) Mexican corn! yumm. Chicken curry was delicious.  Cons: Waited a while for our waitress to take our drink order. Couldn't see her so I had to flag down the hostess who was passing by, so she could send her to our table. Nothing I wanted seconds of, but it could have been because I had round 1 at the Carnival World Buffet (no bueno) Is in the basement floor so it's a little bit stuffy/musty.  I'd say it's worth a try, but I don't think I will be paying to go back.",

We waited probably 15 minutes before getting seated, which wasn't bad since we also wanted to catch the Saints & Broncos game.  For seafood, there was snow crab, not Alaskan king crab. The shrimp tasted very dry and tough. The meat selection was decent. I didn't bother trying the Asian food, Middle Eastern or the Mexican food, because the food was pretty mediocre. There was no sashimi or sushi selection. The boyfriend tried the Middle Eastern food, but he didn't think too highly of it either. The dessert selection is sort of small, but they do have cotton candy (I've never seen that at a buffet!)  They do have a $12/ person all you can drink deal, but we ended up not doing that because we wanted to save our stomachs for the food. We didn't even stay too long since it was just okay and I didn't feel the need to stuff my face with mediocre food.  I guess for the price and lack of wait, it was an okay buffet. But next time, I definitely will make the trip and spend the money for a better meal.",

Special mention must be made for their dessert selection. The mini creme brulee and lemon meringue pie were outstanding.  The restaurant itself is comfortable and professionally run. Service was friendly, and the layout was easy to understand with a glance.  I heartily recommend Spice Market Buffet.",

Maybe I've just been spoiled by the awesome crab legs at Rio, but Spice Market's crab legs seem to be flavorless and small. The crab legs were the main thing that attracted me, but I did try out some of the other food. The clams seemed good at first, but then i kept finding fragments of shell stabbing at my teeth. The desserts were good, but then again, I'm not really a big desserts person- put some ice cream in front of me and I'm happen. Having been to the Spice Market twice (on different trips), I'll probably avoid it going forward.",

OMG their Middle Eastern selection! the babaganoush was amazing (according to my boyfriend who is ME) my first time trying and i loved it. The lamb vegetables and couscous YUMMY! Mexican selection was fantastic! was not expecting to see elotes (mexican corn on the cob street style) very authentic tasting, and the tacos al pastor also amazing. The desert section was great tbh i had two cupcakes but only ate the tops since the rest of the cupcake seemed like a waste of calories since it was dry... overall amazing buffet highly recommend for lunch...breakfast not so much :D",

The line was really long so it took us about an hour to be seated. The price seemed expensive at first but it was worth it!  I had about 3 or 4 plates of food! Everything was so delicious, unlike any other buffet i've been to. I had everything from sushi to shrimp tempura to chicken curry! The desserts were yummy as well. The staff was attentive and brought us our drinks literally a minute after we asked for them.  Overall, this was the best buffet i've been to and I would recommend it. I know that I'm definitely going back!",

    "text": "We decided to try the Spice Market Buffet because we were at Planet Hollywood Casino, and we thoroughly regretted the decision. I sampled several different foods and they pretty much had two things in common; they were cold and tasteless. The stuffed sole was pretty much all breading with no taste, and cold. The beef (it looked like brisket) was tough, tasteless, and yes, cold. The orange chicken was sweet, tasteless and cold. The amazing part to this is that all the foods mentioned were under heat lamps! The warmest food with any taste was a piece of a sausage. My wife's choices were received with similar taste results. When we found the manager to mention how poorly the buffet was run in terms of both quality of taste and the coldness of the entrees, he said he would get the chef so we could let him know. The manager couldn't be bothered with our concerns. We weren't interested in any comps because the food was so bad we surely didn't want more of it. When the chef arrived at our table, he spoke very halting English and clearly didn't understand what we were saying. The manager clearly was not interested in any criticism of any sort. We should have pointed out to him that the restaurant was less than a quarter occupied - maybe then he might realize that something needs to be done with the food quality at this poorly run restaurant. With the number of buffets on the strip, we will never go to the Spice Market again, and neither should anyone looking for a decent meal.",

    "text": "A buffet is a buiffet. You get excited because youre so hungry and are dreaming of the glorious abundance of decadence and over eating that awaits you.   Whenever i do any buffet i do just like my Mom taught me, which is no matter how much i want to over indulge on those damn chicken wings or the fried rice, i have to stop and think about which buffet items are the most costly to produce and have waiting here for me so that i truly get my moneys worth. Yes i know its very pretencious but smart!  Crab legs - seemed fresh, chilled perfectly. Ive been noticing a lot of other buffets arent watching how they chill the crab legs because ive gotten frozen meat a lot after im breaking these shells which isnt cool. This place know the important of having the butter sauce, which makes it even better.   Prime Rib - a staple among all buffets (sorry hometown) so you really just go off the quality. When i stepped up to the plate to select my cut and size i noticed a lonely and what appeared to be end cut of prime rib just waiting on the side of the cutting board so i then asked the butcher if he was saving that piece for someone. He said whoever asks, its theirs and also complimented me on my choice of cut since the end cut is bay far the best but not a lot of people know about it.....thanks House of Prime Rib for the knowledge  The dessert selection was okay also, the bread pudding was delicious and for all you who love cotton candy, yes they have a machine here however unfortunately its not self serve.  My main recommendation is that if doing any buffet in Vegas, you owe it to yourself really to do the 24 hour buffet pass which lets you do  series of buffets unlimited for 24 hours, the kicker being that the price isnt too far off from admission to a single eating buffet ticket",

    "text": "Personally, I believe couples would fight a lot less if there were more buffets in the world. This place offered us plenty of options to choose from which was perfect for us because we really weren't in the mood for anything in specific. We headed over to Planet Hollywood to purchase tickets for a burlesque show and had some time to kill before the show so we decided to grab dinner. I found the buffet to be spacious and the spread of the stations were well organized. Honestly speaking, for the price you pay for an all you can eat and you can drink buffet, I was not expecting the quality of anything to be out of this world. The buffet had its hits and misses but overall, we enjoyed our experience.  At first, it did take my server a while to refill my champagne glass even though every time she came to the table she would ask my boyfriend if he wanted another beer when he had barely even touched this. After the second refills she caught on to the fact that I was the drinker out of the two and she continuously kept my glass full.  What I Recommend:  - Crab Stuffed Sole: Absolutely loved these! The fish was cooked to perfection and the stuffing was full of flavor. Definitely couldn't have just one!   -Pesto Penne: While I normally stay away from pasta at most restaurants, I decided to give this one a try and it was delicious without being too heavy.  -Pork Buns: Fluffy buns and tender pork, need I say more?  -Meatballs: I didn't have high expectations for these because most meatballs I've tried in restaurants turn out to be bland and dry. These meatballs were moist and seasoned well.  -Crab Legs: Chilled or steamed, these are awesome!  -Cannoli Cupcakes: These were divine! I'm not the biggest fan of sweets but these were great. The cannoli was perfect!   I feel that overall for the price you do get your money's worth if you drink enough.",

    "text": "Part of Vegas's intrigue (for me, at least) is the Buffet of Buffets tour, an all-access pass to some of the best buffets the city of sin has to offer!  For 24 hours after time of purchase, your buffet credentials allow you to literally pack it in, to be the glutton you've never before dared yourself to let loose and become.  This--and more!  Much, much more!--for only $59.99.  My review, then, reflects our complete and utter indulgence--our loosened belts and the imminent guilt--touring the Buffet of Buffets.  Planet Hollywood's \"Spice Market Buffet\": (Dinner, $30.99 without the pass.) I'm sure it was there at the other buffets, but it wasn't until our final stop, here at Spice Market, that I saw cotton candy at a buffet.  That's very creative, cotton candy at a buffet!  (I didn't eat any, but still...)  And what's also a bit different here at the Spice Market is that whatever it is that you're drinking is also serve yourself buffet-style.  (I believe Spice Market also has an all-you-can-drink alcohol menu as well, if that's at all necessary.)  I liked it here, not as much as Rio's buffet, but it's worthy of applause.  Again, there are many, many cuisine styles available to choose from, and the dessert bar is certainly noteworthy, but I have to include how tasty the pork roast was.  I loved it.  As a matter of fact, I felt that the \"American\" selections were much more appealing than some of the others.  I usually stray from American foods (as I've had so much), but the mashed potatoes, green beans, and the sliced pork roast and turkey were my favorites.  Rio's \"Carnival World\": <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-and-seafood-buffet-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/carnival-wo...</a> (Dinner, $34.99 without the pass.)  Paris' \"Le Village Buffet\": <a href=\"http://yelp.com/biz/le-village\">yelp.com/biz/le-village</a>-... (Breakfast, $21.99 without the pass.)  Flamingo's \"Paradise Garden Buffet\": <a href=\"http://yelp.com/biz/paradise-ga\">yelp.com/biz/paradise-ga</a>... (Lunch, $21.62 without the pass.)",

OK, they did have some cookies and soft serve ice cream, but every Chinese buffet has that.    The service was extremely lacking.  They lost our receipt so had to ask for our drink order again and then it took awhile for it to arrive.

I remember the cotton candy machine at the dessert bar and all the different cultural cuisines you can try.  We had the breakfast buffet here on Friday for $20 per person and man, was it bad. We really should have went somewhere else. It doesn't compare to the lunch at all. It wasn't even worth 20 bucks. When we walked in, it was depressing to see that many of the stations with different cuisines were blocked off, and we were only limited to a few stations stocked with breakfast items.  The options are scarce. The breads, pastries, and pancakes were stale and gross. Something out of a plastic bag, sitting in the back for months. I put some corned beef hash on my plate and it was lukewarm and dry. I ended up filling up on fresh fruits and oatmeal, grabbing 2 small glasses of their strawberry banana smoothie and calling it a day. Smoked salmon was brown and old. I got a slice of steak and it was flavorless and difficult to chew. Again, lukewarm. Nothing was hot. It made me lose my appetite.  Do they recycle old food items from the day before for breakfast? Because that's exactly what it tastes like.  NEVER come here for BREAKFAST.",

All else tasted like a frozen dinner.  The only reason this is getting two stars is because there was variety.

I was expecting a lot better since it's on the strip but it only gets an \"eh\" from us.   The reason I give this place 1 star is because two of the four in the party actually got sick after leaving. I'm not sure what caused it. The only thing we can think of is that the two of us ate the mac and cheese and ice cream while the other two, who did not eat these items, did not get get sick.

Regardless, the food is okay for the price in comparison to some places, but if I had known the management was so rude I would have splurged on a nice one.   So here's the story, I found a glass shard in my dessert. Now this was the first time I have ever been there, and I went because my friends said it was a good place. Now I wasn't mad that I found a glass shard in my food because I understand people make mistakes. So I went to the hostess and told her about it and she was shocked. So her took out the dessert from the table display.   When I got back to my seat, my friends didn't want to eat anymore, and we pretty much lost our appetite. My friends were mad because the manager didn't come to see how I was doing, but I didn't mind. So instead we went up there's to the front and my friend called for the manager. When the manager came he was nonchalant and said \"so you're the people who found the glass in your food.\" My friend then asks how do we report the glass in the food, and the manager says that he has taken the food with the glass out so we don't have to do anything. And then it became awkward.   The situation started to feel like we were a few crooks who purposely put glass in the food to score some free stuff. To be honest, I just wanted an apology and a refund. The manner in which the management handled the situation was piss poor. It was only when my other friend started to get angry did the manager offer us a free ticket for the next time we come back. I don't want to have to start a scene to be treated well at a place I paid for. We denied the offer and left while the manager was getting the ticket.   I left that place feeling very disrespected.",

There just wasn't much to choose from anymore.  Too bad as this was a big draw for my family . . . Stayed in Planet Hollywood, eat at the buffet and spend money in the casino and shops.  Will skip PH and Spice Market next time as there are many other better alternatives in LV.",

Cannot be considered a \"Vegas Buffet\" at all. If you are going to wait in line for ANY buffet in Vegas, go to Bacchanal at Caesar's, the Wynn buffet, or Wicked Spoon. Do not come here.  First of all, service was terrible. Was told line would be 20 min, waited close to an hour. A waitress came to take our plates but did not take my dad's empty plate, saying my dad \"might need it later\". His coffee creamer was served in a small drinking glass rather than a proper creamer pitcher.  Secondly, the food was disgusting. I would not have even given the food 3 stars. Maybe 2 stars. Poor presentation and selection of deserts. No fresh fruits, only some weird mashed up fruit salads that tasted like they were regurgitated.   Lobster bisque tasted like pure salt and no lobster. No selection of fresh salads and the sushi was pitiful and not fresh. Mac and cheese wasn't even good, and it's nearly impossible to mess THAT up.  Not worth it.",

They have spicy tuna (the best roll there), California roll (I think), and crab (eh, not my favorite). The sushi was pretty good I must say.   Seafood LIke Meter: 98%   They have lamb there, it tasted delicious!! They also have squash. By the way, they have a variety of \"fancy\" meats and squash on swords. You should definitely check that section out!  Food on A Sword Score: 10000000%  Omg, the deserts are like your swimming in a pool of hot fudge chocolate with cotton candy trees and chocolate bunnies surrounding you!! They have like 100 different cupcakes. I recommend getting the s'mores, THAT is the best cupcake I've eaten in my life!! They also have ice cream. Chocolate and Vanilla. And they have cotton candy! Yummy!  Desert Score: 100000000%  Overall, The Spice Market Buffet is the perfect buffet for anyone who has a big appetite. You are going to have to check this out yourself to see if you like it! I am FOR SURE coming back here!  Oh I almost forgot $20 bucks a person... It's worth it! :)",

    "text": "I have been here approximately five times and Spice Market Buffet has always been a hit-or-miss for me. I either have a great meal there or the food was just not as good as the last time I went.   The food there isn't consistent. I tend to go after the prime rib and it's usually super rare or overly cooked when I get it. I've only had it perfectly cooked twice. Also, I don't recommend the Asian section of the buffet especially the pho because the dishes there lacks a lot of flavor or they over season their dishes.  One major complaint that I have at this buffet is that it's always hard to flag down the waiters, waitresses. When we need extra utensils or a refill on our drinks, they said they'll come back in a minute which turns into fifteen minutes. It's kind of ridiculous. I have also had a bad experience with one of the waitresses having a bad attitude. My boyfriend asked for an Arnold Palmer with Raspberry Iced Tea and she gave this face and said, \"Can't you order something else like, a coke?\" Come on now..don't need to get crazy over a drink order.  Even though the food isn't perfect, I do enjoy coming here because most of the food they offer is pretty good. I also really love their dessert bar. The first time I ate here, they had this chocolate mousse and it was the best chocolate mousse I ever had. I keep coming back here hoping that I can have it again but my luck has always been bad and have never seen it since. Other than that, I like the pies that they offer.  Overall, Spice Market is like your typical Vegas buffet, crowded and overpriced.",

Anyway, for the food, they have your usual stations here.  Seafood, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, American, and my favorite, Middle Eastern.  Now I'm not the biggest lamb fan, but this lamb tasted even better than beef.  It was good!  As for the other stuff, they were very fresh and tasted better than most buffet places near the strip.  They actually taste like they cooked each dish for you and not in a big vat for 100 people.  They have lots of servers, so expect to have your drinks filled very fast and as courteous as possible.  FYI:  They have big shrimp cocktail that you don't even have to peel!",

I usually recommend this buffet to friends and family, especially on how great the crab legs are. But if everyone ate here on this particular day, they would all look at me downright crazy.  I was highly disappointed in the crab legs. They were still semi-frozen and not completely thawed out. Once I took a bite out of the meat, all I could taste was the combination of ice crystals and flavorless shellfish. Okay, I figured why not try to salvage this. I tried waiting for the legs to thaw out, tried dipping the crab into some melted butter, and even ordered a cup of steaming hot water in an attempt to thaw out the legs. Nothing worked. The poor crab meat had already suffered from freezer burn. It was too late.  I suspected that the workers behind the counter knew this, because I didn't see anyone behind the counter near the crab legs. They probably didn't want to deal with anyone bombarding them to steam the crab legs. It would simply take too much time.   I also saw a dish entitled Lobster Pasta or something similar to that. Upon closer inspection, it was simply lumps of imitation crab meat. Ohh, that was so wrong. While everything else was pretty good, I sincerely hope that this crab catastrophe was just a one-time thing. Consider it a mulligan. I'll be back next time for one last chance.",

I had already blown a lot of money  (w/out ever touching a slot machine or a table) and I wanted to make sure that this place was worth it.    The place was packed and sitting next to us were the entire Miss America Pageant contestants.  I'm not sure how relevant this observation was, but it was nice to see some eye candy, along with poke fun at how it must be some competition to see how little they could eat.   As with most buffets, the food seemed to go on forever.  I did the smart thing and walked all the way down, taking key notes on everything that caught my eye.  Omelette station?  Yes.  Flaming Crepes?  Yum.   Tempura Shrimp?  Hell yes I was going to stop by there.    Omelette's are great at any time of the day and I was not disappointed with this one.  The bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes and melted cheese were folded in perfectly and tasted oh so good.  I tried keeping the carbs down to a minimum here since I wanted to try a little bit of everything.    I stopped over to grab some Tempura Shrimp and since my stomach was grumbling by now,  I picked one off my plate and took a little bite.  Did I say little bite?  Well, one bite turned into 3 killed Shrimp.  They were done before I made the long walk back down to my table.  Along the way, I grabbed some cod stuffed with crab and some fried wontons.    First plate was a success!!  I know some of you have to feel me on this when you go to a buffet and the first round picks always don't make it to the finals.  Not in this case.  Everything on my plate (even tho I didn't wipe it clean) was good!  I was also introduced to some Middle Eastern food when my sis forked me over some awesome tasting hummus into my mouth.  I'm not a big hummus eater and this was something that I could see myself having in my fridge.    Miraculously, I did *not* touch the desert station because I was so full from having a fresh strawberry filled crepe.. I do have to say that seeing this crepe made with the alcohol flames was quite the spectacle.  The whipped cream on this baby was *fresh*,  not the store bought kind).  And the drizzle of chocolate was definitely not Hershey's..   My only regret was that I wish I came with a bigger appetite.  Having gotten completely wasted into the wee hours of the morning, my stomach could only take so much.    I would definitely recommend this place after going here.  But, I'd be lying to say that I would come back.  This is Vegas and there are way too many places that I'd like to try (like the Wynn Buffett)!  before making my way back.",

They should call it the Black market buffet, cause more than 1/2 the items are from another dimension Went for lunch and was looking forward to one thing mainly: crab legs. After forking over 35/person WITH players card for brunch, headed right at seafood section, only to be told \"sir crab legs are served at dinner only.\" That's bullshit, used to be all the time. The only good item was the potato leek soup, and somewhat edible is the tandoori grilled chicken skewers that look like its alien meat color. The salad bar is so weak, never saw any bar like this only toppings are cheese, dressings, and croutons. What a joke. Mexican section is tragic, no taco meat, instead you have mystery bean dish, and steak fajitas that looked awful. They have chicken taco as carbon tasted bland, ice cold, bits of bones couldn't chew, and crappy. Asian section droned in sauce some unidentifiable items, again very limited. Italian section had a 1/4 cheese and a 1/4 pepperoni pizza that was still there, no new pizzas made, in the 30 min we were there. Awful. Some other breakfast leftover items, and disguting dishes drenched in sauce that looks like where the griswolds ate with their inbred cousins in Vegas Vacation. If was really, really bad.  Oh, their deserts looked good, they have a big section for that, I just don't care for sweets. They should close the buffet and just do a sweets buffet.  I knew when there was no wait, yes, NO WAIT on a Saturday to be seated, I shouldve walked away. Stay the FUCK away from this horrific buffet. And its a rip-off too!!!

For dinner, I prefer the World Carnival buffet at Rio. It definitely has more selection. Yes it was cool they have cotton candy as a dessert, but by the end of your meal, the last thing you want to stuff in your mouth is a fluff of sugar. I was also excited about the cheese they had, unfortunately most of the cheese was dried out and getting hard. Out of all the things I ate, the best thing there was the crab legs. They weren't too salty or watery like other buffets and I do like how they cut them in half so it's easier to get the meat out. Other than that, there was nothing special about the food. Definitely stop by the Rio buffet instead if you are only going to one dinner buffet.",

I think that with buffets, you can not expect a high quality in food since they are preparing so many different dishes in such large amounts, but this certainly was not the worst that I have had.  Overall I think that I would go again if I were on the strip.  I would not waste my time with Todai and I probably would not want to spend more money at the MGM for sushi or Asian cuisine at the Grand Wok and so I would opt for this.  The M Studio B buffet is still my favorite.",

If you're a trooper and are already up for drinking again...they also have a champane brunch (only $5 more than the normal brunch price of $23).  I like the set up of the place.  They have stations for: Asian, Salads, Breakfast, Mexican, Middle-East, Dessert, and maybe some others.  Desert booth is by far the best IMHO.  Check this: they have cotton candy you can take to-go (at least i think you can..i did it :P).  Other desserts are scrumptous too (check out the mousse pic i posted).  Other food highlights: fresh crepes, decent prime rib, smoked salmon, crab ragoon, baklava, great omelettes, hot & sour soup, variety of mousses.   I'd highly recommend it if you're looking to do a buffet in Vegas :).",

Snowcrab legs like every buffet was the most popular thing on the menu, people were just grabbing plates of them. Sometimes they were hot, sometimes they were chilled which was a little weird. The food is tasty though and we all ate ourselves into a food coma.   We went at prime dinner time 6 PM and had to wait in line for about 45 minutes. There's a line on the casino floor to take the escalator downstairs to wait in another line. That was a little disappointing to finally get through one line only to go into another. The service is spotty, sometimes no one would pick up our plates until a few had collected, sometimes it was right as we finished. We only went to one buffet in Vegas so don't have something to compare it with except buffets here and I must say, it's one of the better buffets I've ever been to in terms of food quality.",

    "text": "Fast line for the food since it's a Tuesday. Went here for lunch and I'd recommend this for people who love to eat American/ comfort foods. Fish and chips, ribs, and quesadillas. Definitely try their couscous!!! So delicious the flavors exploded in my mouth. Top it off with their glazed carrots. Waiter was kind but kinda slow. It's okay since the buffet was $20/ person. They have lots of pasta like seriously lots. Lasagna, mac and cheese, penne pesto, pizza, etc! Plus lots of vegetarian choices including Mexican. I dare you to make yourself a milkshake. Ask the waiter for a  separate cup and run to the dessert section. Their vanilla soft serve is surprisingly different and creamier. Toppings are glazed strawberries, Oreos, and Heath. My favorite. Put strawberries on the bottom of the cup then swirl up the vanilla ice cream til the top and put more strawberries and finish it with whipped cream. Try it!!!! They have a lot of cupcakes too. It's decent. Go for the couscous.",

    "text": "Each time my family frequents the Las Vegas Strip on holiday, we set aside one night for a dinner buffet & this time, we finally visited the Spice Market Buffet!  I really liked this one because of its wide layout & full selection - To me, it seemed longer/ larger in size than most other Vegas buffets... Meaning that the various kitchens were seen stretched out across a huge plain in a way that actually took some time to get through  Luckily, we spent some time walking around the shops in the Miracle Mile before coming here, to make sure were hungry & super ready once we got started :p As far as the food options here, I found that there were plenty of non-meat dishes alongside the meat ones, so it was, i.m.o., an acceptable buffet for someone with a Vegetarian diet (and perhaps somewhat accommodating for a Vegan). The title categories in this buffet include, Seafood, Salad (on both ends of the room), Italian, Asian, American, Mid-Eastern, & Mexican. The Seafood seemed traditional (Paella, crab legs, stuffed fish, sushi, etc.) but very decent in presentation, Salads were mostly prepared mixes, next to some free toppings & leaves, & the rest housed all the usual/ popular items you'd expect: pizza, pasta, lasagna, dried meats & cheeses, lo mein, fried rice, Thai eggplant, egg rolls, dumplings, fried chicken + biscuits, steamed vegetables, prime rib, (mashed and au gratin) potatoes, tabbouleh, hummus, stuffed grape leaves, curry, naan, curried cauliflower, lamb, & veggie kabobs, rice, beans, tacos, tamales, quesadillas, salsa, guac, & other toppings, with tons of bread! I found almost all the food I tried to be pretty good but I specifically went back for the eggplant, curry sauce, & veggie kabobs more than once :) I was, however, sad to find that the soup (both Miso & Tortilla varieties) were way too salty for my taste, even though I love salt & I love soup! lol I was also disappointed with the Dessert table, as it strongly lacked creativity or any sense of variety compared to all the other buffets I've been to. Besides the watery bread pudding & some nasty-looking, canned fruit crumble thing, there were not many other plates laid out. I saw creme brulee, mini cheesecakes, small parfaits, & ice cream but other than those... there was nothing more than 10 different kinds of cupcakes. For the cupcakes, they had some very simple flavours like Mint Choc Chip, Chocolate Raspberry, Cannoli, Bananas Foster, Strawberry Shortcake, Keylime Pie, S'mores, & Cookies + Cream... which may sound good to some people but I would have liked to see something other than cupcakes... Since it is a buffet & people will most likely be returning to the dessert bar more than once, I think they would do better with a bigger selection (i.e. fruit, custards, cakes, brownies, & other crap that people only allow themselves to eat on vacation :p). However, they do offer a \"Chef's Special Selection\" that I'm guessing they change frequently, which happened to be some pre-cooked (then reheated) crepes w/ nutella & sugared-bananas that night  We came around 10 p.m. (1 hr before closing) on Sunday night & were treated very well in the V.I.P. section - Plates cleared often, drinks constantly refilled, social/ talkative waitress, & ALL food items present & filled as if it was still an early dinner hour... So we really enjoyed ourselves at this buffet & would easily return even with our plans to make our way through all the others on the strip :D",

Only half the buffet was open and the selection was very disappointing.  The  surprising part was the disappointing food...at the carving station they were serving the NY strip...I love NY Strip, but this was closer to a shoe leather and tasted like it as well.  The rest of the buffet was bland, flavorless, boring, and a complete disappointment.  Thank goodness we were on a BOB so aside from a tip, we left and went to Paris Village Buffet to make up for the disappointment.",

The line was long which fooled us and made me think it was going to be good. All the food was freezing cold from the soup to the \"steamed\" crab to the stuffed sole. Shouldn't there be some steam coming off of my \"steamed\" crab? Where is the Health Department to stick a temperature gauge in their food???? I won't be surprised if I wake up tomorrow sick as a dog from trying the food here. Robert Irvin need to come here and do a remix to Restaurant Impossible and have this place on Buffet Impossible! The steak fajita meat was mushy and the pizza dough was raw. Their food tasted like it came from a can. This was equal to elementary cafeteria food. All of the food was either bland or entirely too sweet. PLEASE WHATEVER YOU DO...DO NOT EAT HERE. Planet Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves delivering such sub par food. This by far was the worst food experience ever! YUCK!!!!!!!",

Went to the Sunday Brunch only because the hotels offer the $5 off per person (I now know why).  But if i had known how bad this place was I woulda said screw the discount.  The food was cold.  It looked days old. I definitely had to spit some of it out.  Rice was so dry it tasted like sand, Fajitas looked like and tasted like dog turd. Eggs were super watery. Their au jus tasted like armpit.  The \"fresh\" crepes were newspaper tossed in some butter with canned strawberries inside.  And their bread pudding was basically egg with sugar.  On top of that every cook looked like they were miserable to be there, really if you dont enjoy what you do (especially when it comes to cooking) then what are you doing there?  The cooks' lack of enthusiasm to love what they do completely reflects on their food!  Absolutely do not recommend.  Try the treasure island or mgm buffet instead almost the same price and way better food.",

I went back for my first time in about 2 years this past week and some things were better (the tandori chicken) some things were worse (the orange juice, the pizza, the fried chicken) but when you couple all of that with the fact that they have a bathroom on premises. it balances out.",

At this buffet, you can definitely taste the high quality their food is compared to others.  Desserts are to die for!!!!  MUST TRY! =)  The best of the cheesecake!

In fact, I've always disliked buffets because you have quantity over quality, but I wanted to try this one out just for the experience since it's Vegas and all.  I guess I will have to try the Rio buffet the next time since my boyfriend raves about it.  Anyways, here, the selection was aplenty.  You have Mexican, American, Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, and maybe I forgot something else. I absolutely loved the ribs except when I dribbled on way too much extra sauce.  The noodles were the best I've ever had.  And the dessert, yummm.  But what is up with all the Ethiopian servers?  Haha.",

    "text": "After reading all the great reviews here I was very surprised to find how less-than-satisfactory our visit to the Spice Buffet Market was on Saturday morning.  I don't write negative reviews but this called for it.  We went there for brunch at around 11am.  The options seemed appealing, but taste-wise it was appalling.  My three most-liked: crab-stuffed sole, baklava and lemon macaroons.  Even so, sauce for the sole was extremely salty and the baklava seemed drenched in liquid sugar and was tough to bite into.  Many of the dishes I tried tasted confusing to me... sometimes too bland (mid-eastern dishes) or all around *not right*, like the wonton soup in the Asian section.  First there was not a single wonton in that pot, it was just broth.  Second, too obvious that the broth was really Knorr's chicken bouillon.  For a place that has received rave reviews I would expect the broth to be cooked properly, not boiled bouillon.  We won't go back to this place.",

    "text": "I was in Las vegas last week June 3 - 7, 2013 and purchased the Groupon prior to eat lunch at this buffet.  I was excited, but the excitement slowly became disappointment.  There was no line at peak lunch time 12:30pm, this was my first warning sign, but since I already had the Groupon I was dedicated to having my meal there. The Groupon was a good deal especially since it came with the unlimited drinks deal.  The champagne was pretty good, and unlimited coronas was a nice touch, but how much can you drink, drinking lots of beer, wine, and champagne limits how much food you can eat. Now to the food... The food was bland and dry.  The portions the woman was carving at the carving station made me even hungrier, by the fourth time I went to her station I just asked for 4 times the regular amount.  The only decent items at this buffet were the beef from the carving station, the pesto pasta, and the fajitas.  The rest of the food was take a bite and leave the rest type of food.  The desserts were the worst part of all.  They had all these wonderful tempting looking cupcakes, there must have been 25 different flavors all looked good, I tried a bite from four different ones, all were stale and dry.  Such a let down, I highly recommend going elsewhere especially when considering this places regular prices.",

Don't like the Mexican pork chili stew, taste of the grease from pork skin and fat are too heavy to swallow.  as a chinese, their asian section do not look promising at all, I skipped it. honey said their kao pao chicken is kind of dry.  like the grilled aspargas.  one advise, drag the shrimp from the bottom, the one on the top are room temperatured.  the tempura is not bad.  I only try one spicy tuna sushi, average.  the good part is desert, the banana frosting crepe, I had half banana and half strawberry, it was great, if you still have room, try the cream burle.

The chef said that especially with the Mediterranean meats they were preferred overcooked. Overcooked and dry meat? I don't think so. The noodles at the Asian station were also dry. Sitting out too long, or just not enough liquid in the mix? Not sure. The Mexican, again, the taco meat was on the dry, overcooked side. Most buffets the taco meat is way too oily/juicy. This the complete opposite. The carving station had very good prime rib. Desserts were also on the good side. Nice variety. Good soft serve ice cream. Being Diamond level we were \"treated\" to a special fish dish which was very tasty. Also got some chocolate dipped brownie rounds which were so good and such a nice diversion from the standard chocolate dipped strawberries. Disappointing, but I'm sure they are still moving over to Harrah's standards which means they're almost going for a standard flavor across all their buffets. Sad.",

There was even a message advertising it on the room phone. But I'm glad I listened to it, because you receive $5 off per person if you're staying at their hotel. That makes it only $12 for a lunch buffet! Just show them your card key while at the register and you'll receive the discount. That's $5 you can save and then waste on the slot machines. Their selection was really good but in terms of food taste and quality, their food was simply mediocre. Definitely not bad, but it wasn't great. With a #1 title, you'll come in with high expectations right? But I'm forgiving since it was so cheap. They get three stars from simply having cotton candy in the dessert section! I didn't eat any, but the kid in me was simply happy from seeing the fluffly pink and blue sugar.",

    "text": "If this is one of the best buffets on the strip, then I can't imagine what the bad ones are like.  I wandered into the Spice Market Buffet because I wanted something quick and casual for dinner and I'm staying at Planet Hollywood.  Having never been to a Las Vegas buffet before I figured it is something that one needs to experience anyway.  First I was a little surprised by how much it cost:  $28.00.  Isn't this supposed to be cheap eats?  Oh yeah, there's no such thing in Vegas.  The food was across the board awful.  I made my way around the world starting with middle eastern food.  I tossed some hummus on my plate with a stuffed grape leaf and the guy behind the counter served me some grilled chicken hunks, which were pink like it was tandoori (weird) with a small pita.  The pita was totally stale and the chicken was dry as a bone.  The hummus and the stuffed grape leaf were just ok.  I then moved on to the seafood - ah, the ever popular all you can eat shrimp and alaskan king crab legs.  I was excited but quickly disppointed at the first bite.  The crab was incredibly salty, watery and had a strange texture.  The shrimp were the same as the ones you get at the supermarket pre cooked.  After I abandoned the seafood I went for mexican.  I picked up a flour tortilla, some beans, cheese and cilantro, but passed on all of the protein because it looked so bad.  I picked up one small piece of chicken to taste (with the tongs of course!!!) and it was super salty and peppery.  I wrapped up what I had in the tortilla and it was okay.  The beans were pretty good.  Then for good measure I stopped at the italian food and chose a spinach lasgana roll.  yuck.  Also too salty and had a funny texture.  Kind of like bad frozen stuff.  All in all this was a bad food experience.  I'd give it no stars if yelp would let me.",

When you have food allergies you want to be able to have a span of options to choose from. He thinks the food selection and quality is decent and I think we've had better. It's not a fancy buffet with unique dishes...just your typical buffet with Mexican, American, Italian, Asian, Seafood, Salad and Dessert stations. For about the same price I would prefer to go to the Rio Carnival Buffet.. they have a better seafood selection. The seafood selection here is not that great, small crab legs and itty bitty size shrimps. Some of the dishes seems a bit dried and over cooked. Also, the down part of this place is that it's like a journey to get here from the parking structure....it's quite a walk. It's great after your full and well feed on your walk back to the car (to help with digestion)...but when your starving, you barely have the energy to walk through the entire mall, casino and having to stand in line to pay. I guess if you were here to shop to begin with you wouldn't mind...but just for the buffet....ah...save your energy!",

So this is the first buffet we decided to try.  Sole stuffed with crab was pretty tasty.  I liked it.  Shrimp Tempura was pretty good.  I went back and got seconds.  Italian Meatballs - I had one that was really good, but then the next one was really really salty.  Bad batch I guess.  The restrooms were in a weird place.  They were located near the entrance before the registers.  So you had to leave the buffet area to go to the restrooms, and there was this weird elevator there.  I'm not sure where that went.  There wasn't a place to change a baby's diaper.  And I guess now that matters to me.   Overall, it was an average buffet.  Good but not great.  Lunchtime anyway.  I'm sure there's more to offer at dinner time.",

I almost paid double the amount for the Cosmopolitan buffet the last time and there was, double the wait, half as much variety, poor service and they stop refilling items after a while. The drink service here was prompt and great. They included all sorts of beer, wine, mimosas, sodas, ice teas, etc. in the brunch. Mimosas were really nice. The staff was friendly and efficient.    Food - I am usually not a huge buffet fan, but everything that I tried was tasty. They have seafood, breakfast, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Country and an Asian section and a huge desserts variety. The Mediterranean section had some succulent lamb and chicken options. Tons of vegetarian options overall - , nachos, hummus, soups, salads, 3 types of veggie pizzas, noodles, rice, tofu, veggie spring rolls and much more. The desserts section was fantastic - exquisite cupcakes, candy floss, ice cream, cheesecakes etc. There were also made to order eggs, crepes, pancakes and fresh waffles.   Definitely give this place a try and don't think twice if you are a vegetarian, you will have plenty of options. If you want a good buffet for a good price, Spice Market is the place to try!",

We probably had to stand in line for about 45min before finally getting to the registers, only to find out we still had to pay taxes ($11ish for 6 ppl) not that bad but give us the heads up ppl!  The food was just meeeeh!!!! Im assuming it was because it was the end of the night. They do close at 11pm but we left a bit after midnight. Yes, we were the rowdy Mexicans who wouldn't leave because we wanted to keep on drinking ;) But thats because we didn't like the food so we opted to just drink! 3 stars for the great service from the waiter & the wine and beer. -2 stars for the food. . . I wouldn't go out of my way to pay full price for this place!",

They did however have cotton candy which is cool. - Themed stations were all meh, except the Mediterranean station which was the highlight.  Overall, I recommend saving your money and going to a higher end buffet. Nothing really special here.",

Service: 5 - The waitress would come pick up our plates occassionally but with a large party they stacked up quickly.

Maybe it was all the different foods mixing, but when I walked down the stairs and got a whiff of what was to come, I wished we went to different buffet. But this one is my friend's favourite, so I just had to buck up.  They told us it would be a while if we wanted to sit together. We opted to break our group up because me eat now. When we sat down, the table beside us left shortly after. They could have bussed the table beside us and sat us all together, but it sat dirty until we left... I guess in the melee that is dinner, things go the wayside.   It was crab-tastic. It was a hard fight though because you have to throw elbows to get near it... and there is lots. That's all I had... oh and some grilled veggies. Actually, I lie. I had meat... a nice slice of prime rib. Oh and some creme brulee. I never make it past the dessert area because that to me signals the end. Unfortunately that means I missed the Meditteranean section and the Mexican section.   I think I was feeling the after effects of my brekkie/lunch buffet because I just wasn't feeling this one.",

Their salad bar was equipped with only the very basics and had nothing special. I could see my reflection in the grease sitting on top of the pizza.

The food is good, but I can see why some aren't as thrilled with it as I am. For the regular price, this place is not worth it. However, I've been fortunate to always find a 2 for 1 on Groupon. The last time we went here the Groupon was a 2 for 1 with a bottle of champagne. Not shabby at all.  When I come here I go for their prime rib which is always exceptionally made. I also like that their crab legs are sliced open so that I don't have to use my crab cracking skills to open my son's & boyfriend's crab legs. More crab time for me! :D  The desserts are ok. They have a crepe station, but the crepes are pre-made. :/  This place can get a very long wait line. The first time I was here I waited almost 2 hrs.! That's a bit too long to wait when you're starving. Found out though that you can call and they will let you know over the phone how long the line is so that you don't have to waste your time waiting in line. Why waste your time in line when you can waste your time drinking? You can also waste your time wasting your money. :D",

But I have tried a handful abd this one seems to be pretty good. I give it a four and not a five because I specifically wanted the tandoori chicken skewers and was there for dinner yet they only had lamb. It would help to remove the sign as well.  Food selection is versatile and very satisfying. They have two different salad bars which include healthy choices and a good variety. Entire seafoid bar. The middle eastern food was very well executed and the variety was so fresh. The Mexican food was fresh and the chicken fajitas were so tasty. Their breads on both sides of the restaurant are so delicious.  OMG THE DESSERT!!! Crepes made to order. Fabulous creme brule, and a variety of cupcakes that is so overwhelming. Cotton candy, ice cream, other tours if cakes, cobbler, bread pudding. If you want to try one buffet this should be it.",

    "text": "The Spice Market Buffet is located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino (formerly the Aladdin). I had very high expectations going into this place. Not only had I heard from other people that this was the best buffet in Vegas, but in front of the restaurant, there was a huge sign that said \"Best Buffet of 2007.\"  The buffet is split into different sections, such as: seafood, Asian, Mexican, etc. For those who know me, it will not surprise you to know that I went for the seafood (the expensive stuff...aka Alaskan King Crab) first.  When I finally got to the seafood line, I could not believe what I saw. There was a line around 30-40 people long, waiting their turns to take MY crab. At the Bellagio, the crab was stationed in a very easy to reach setting and there was never more than a couple people waiting in line. At the Spice Market, I literally waited 15 minutes in line to get at the crabs.  After I had my fill of crab that took me about a million years to get, I went to go try the other dishes. Out of everything that I tried, Jeffrey's BBQ Ribs and the kabobs impressed me the most.  I tried to have a good time, but the waiting in line really spoiled it for me that evening. There are only 2 reasons people go to buffets: 1) all you can eat; 2) the instant gratification of having your food there, prepared and ready to go.  I'm not saying that this was a bad experience, but for my buck, I am going back to the Bellagio to have a real Vegas buffet.",

I am so disappointed. The rest of the food is hit or miss. The last trip we went some of the food had been sitting out too long and was cold/crunchy. The pork (carnitas) taos was the best thing I ate that night. Hard to make up $45 for a buffet with tiny carnitas tacos... And the service wasn't great either. We got ignored half the time by our waitress. All I wanted wsa some napkins and a tea refill.When we first got there I was lookiing for the hot crab legs they used to have and couldn't find them so I asked a cook behind the serving station \"Do you still have hot crab legs?\" He said \"We are unable to answer your questions. If you need an answer talk to your waiter\". Ok... A simple no would have sufficed. When I got to dessert I was thinking of all the yummy things I had got there before (creme brulee, tarts, little cakes...) no, only a few sad little cupcakes and none of them tasted good. I had actually tasted some last visit and liked them so I don't know what happened. But the whole quality of this buffet has gone way downhill. So sad :-(",

I took a party of 9 today for breakfast, spending over $180 only to find the quality had fallen off significantly.  As examples, the cheese on the cheese platter was dry and the edges curling.  The baked oatmeal was so over cooked that you could not get a serving spoon to break the  crust.  The bowl of compote at the crepe station were very unappetizing.  In fact the bananas foster with peaches resembled vomit.  I infact spoke to the manager, Keith, and his.attitude was that he could care less and did missed my comments.  Save your money and find another breakfast buffet.  This review should actually have 1star but the attitude of the waitstaff was excellent.  The only.redeeming feature of this Buffett.",

    "text": "We went for Brunch this past Sunday.  After hearing the hype about the place, I was actually looking forward to it.  Maybe I'm just not a buffet fan... who knows... but I was not too impressed.  First off, I was really looking forward to the breakfast items (nothing like bacon and eggs and shaking off a hangover).  I went right for the eggs benedict, my favorite.  They looked perfect, until I cut in at least.  Cooked through... no yolk.  WTF?!  This is a brunch staple here!  So, I got some more to try again... no dice... I could have broken a window with the yolk.  Oh well...the bacon was cooked right at least!  Middle Eastern and Sushi are my favorite foods, so I was pysched to see they had both.  The Middle Eastern section was very good.  The meats, grape leaves and hummus all were great.  The sushi was OK.  Nothing fancy, just the basic 3 rolls, but they satisfied my craving for raw fish in the morning at least.  I did not try too much otherwise... I think the overcooked eggs just pissed me the hell off and I lost my will to consume 4X my daily recommended intake of food in one sitting.  As far as service, it was very attentive at least, and the atmostphere was what you would expect for a buffet.  But, as far as being the \"Best in Las Vegas\", I would HATE to see what the others are like!  I went to the one at Wynn a couple times in the past, and I would rate that MUCH higher than this!",

The inside was plain and reminded me of a cheap buffet restaurant/cafeteria. We arrived at 1:30 pm and they still had breakfast out which took away from some of the entrees I was wanting to try. I tried little bite size pieces of all the available dishes and while it was all edible and not horrible, it also wasn't succulent and make me want more. I would definitely go somewhere else before I came here again.   Likes: they did have Mexican and Indian stations. My favorite dish was a tropical salsa.   Dislikes: seafood and meat was lacking as they still had breakfast. Pork buns were dried out and hard.",

It was filled with grilled veggies, lamb and cold sides that tasted terrible but no chicken Tikka, rice or naans were to be found. They had some \"Italian\" food options which only included some turkey and meat with some 1 dry pasta with no sauce. The other options were very limited with a salad bar, some Mexican stuff, and unappetizing soup that looked like it had been there the entire day. The dessert was not bad. I tried the creme brulee and thought it was pretty good. The drinks were self serve here and they had your regular sodas, juices and coffee.   Overall, definitely not worth the time or money.

Dinner included soda, you can purchase unlimited beer and wine packages but we were just looking for some good food at this point. It was 8-9pm and there was minimal wait. Staff was very friendly from the front desk to our waitress. Service was excellent.   Immediately it became obvious that most of the food was not fresh. I don't care much for crab legs (I know, gasp!) but I definitely wouldn't have wanted any after I saw the crab legs coming straight out of a large white utility bucket - uggh, so unappetizing. They had some peel and eat shrimp but I was too lazy for that and honestly didn't trust the seafood after I saw what the crab legs came out of.   The salad and Mexican taco/burrito bars were standard but had quite a bit of brown lettuce. The macaroni and cheese was flavorful and creamy and I did enjoy this. My husband enjoyed a piece of prime rib. The desert was basic and unimpressive for a Vegas buffet. The ice cream melted quick and was watery.   If we would've paid full price for this buffet, I would've been upset. This buffet is definitely not up to par for Vegas, needs a lot of work. I would avoid it with so many other options for dinner on the Strip. Would rate the food 2/5 but service was 4/5.",

    "text": "This was our last buffet before our \"Buffet of Buffets\" pass expired.   We arrived around 4pm. After getting the green light from the cashiers we waited in a line to be seated. We waited for about 10 mins, which we thought was quite long because there were open tables available! We also did not get much service from our server. Nevertheless, we were eventually seated and ready to explore the buffet.  Spice Market Buffet had an excellent variety of food to choose from. They rival even Rio's! I really liked their lamb kabobs and pesto pasta. The asian selection was also great and they had jasmine rice in mini togo boxes which was \"cute\" remarked my cousin.   This buffet had delicious food but their slow service was disappointing. I would visit again, depending on the price.  My ranking of buffets 1. Le Village Buffet (Paris) 2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio) 3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) 4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's)  Didn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full!",

We ate there in Thursday night, around 10pm and noticed it was a bit empty. I thought perhaps it was because it's late?  We were seated and we're pleased to see a great variety of food, Chinese, Mexican, American, Mediterranean, Italian and seafood.   We decided to try a plate of each. The food was cold, no flavor, just lacked taste. We tried everything on the menu with the hopes of finding something tasty. We decided to leave 20 minutes in, and asked to speak with the manager.  My husband explained how bad our experience was and he said he could not give us a full refund, approximately $70. He said it had been more than 20 minutes. My husband continued to explain the experience we had and the manager decided to speak with the waitress. After he verified with her that we had served twice and 90% of the food was thrown he gave us two options: offered us a voucher to go the next day for breakfast or lunch, or half a refund.  We opted for half a refund.",

The waitress who is supposed to clean our table off told us that she is \"busy\" and did not tend to our table. Her name is Janet. The manager who came over to speak with us by the name of \"cookie\" was very short with us and told us that we cannot be seated at a booth because we werent \"platinum members\".  Finally after being seated at a booth anyways, none of the waiters/waitresses came and got our drink orders. We wound up asking for a refund because of how were being treated and they said they had to call \"cookie\" back down and she didn't even have enough decency to come face us again so she just had them issue it. This took place memorial day weekend May 28th, 2017. I love PH but I will not be back to their buffet.",

    "text": "Spice Market quality is way up, but the selection is way down.  I am a buffet snob. I have gone to Vegas buffets 3 to 12 times per year for the past 20 years. I believe in quality, not just quantity. If I am going to eat 5000 calories and gain a pound or two, it had better not be lousy food.  The Spice Market at Planet Hollywood has been marginal for many years. Very large selection, but low quality preparation. They made management changes after being acquired by Caesar's and produced a major upgrade in the quality of their food earlier this year. Then they had a big flood in July.  When they remodeled, they eliminated their seafood and Italian selections along with cutting other offerings, to hold prices down. Lunch is now $20 and dinner $26. Dinner used to be $35. Bellagio is $28 and $39 and Caesar's is $55 and $65. If you don't find something you like in the the limited selections offered, or you expect a $65 meal for a $20 price, you will likely be disappointed. Other recent Yelp reviews seem to reflect these unrealistic expectations.  There are fewer selections, and no crab or shrimp, but what they do serve is very well prepared and seasoned. I have been there twice in the past 6 months, both before the flood and after.  Five of us tried about 40 different dishes and desserts. Everything was cooked to perfection and had great taste. The only Item that was not excellent was the beef brisket, which always seems a little tough when you are expecting prime rib. Both the dessert selections and quality are very good, but there is no gelato or ice cream, only frozen custard.  The \"M\" buffet was pretty good for years, but they got a new chef and it has now become the best buffet in Vegas for the the past two years. Especially considering the price. $17 for lunch and $25 for dinner weekdays. The selection is huge, the quality is very good, and the desserts are to die for. They even have free beer and wine.  Bellagio has always set the benchmark for quality, but it seems to be slipping lately and their prices are rising rapidly. Wynn is good, but overpriced. Caesar's is very overpriced and has problems with crowd management at the carving stations, crowd noise due to background music, and the dessert selection is poor.  The Red Rock is still the best $10-$16 buffet, but it has been slipping a little lately. Mirage was OK several years ago when they remodeled, but I haven't been there lately, and I understand the Palms just opened a new buffet which I haven't tried. The last time I went there it was good food, but not many choices. Aria, Mandalay, Paris, Harrah's, Monte Carlo, Excaliber, TI, Circus Circus, South Point, Rio, and all the Station and Boyd Gaming Casinos are boring or just plain bad. The Orleans just remodeled and  the food looks great, but everything was extremely bland. I never went to the MGM, but others, whose judgement I trust, said it was only fair.  I highly recommend you try the Planet Hollywood for a reasonably priced high quality meal, especially when compared to weekend pricing at other casino's on the strip. I also highly recommend a trip down south to the \"M\" for a few dollars less on the weekdays if you want a huge selection with prime rib, salmon, clams, Thai, Chinese, sushi, etc. Save room for several desserts. It's worth the drive. If you have to have crab, go to the Bellagio. It's still one of the best regardless of price.  You can use the pay for lunch, stay for dinner at the Spice Market by arriving just before 3:00. You pay $20 for lunch and get dinner too. You can do this at the \"M\" and the Bellagio also, but dinner starts at 2:30 pm. Most of the dishes and desserts are the same for lunch and dinner. They just bring out the prime rib and crab or other seafood for dinner.",

Chicken fajita mix - fairly tasty and luckily not dry. Sesame balls were VERY good! Drunken noodles were meh at best. Potstickers were also meh - not much flavor and what was there wasn't all that good. Homemade meatballs were delicious. Sauce was extremely tasty and meatball texture was soft and slightly chewy. Prime rib was a notch above Harrahs having better consistency, texture and overall flavor, but nowhere CLOSE to Paris.  Shrimp were good and the sauce had a spicy tang to it. Great.  Desserts: all cupcakes were completely inedible. ZERO flavor. Creme Brule was made with liquid smoke. Raspberry coulis had mild flavor but the main part tasted like bad cheesecake. Pannacotta was sadly just OK. Mild flavor but just wasn't rich enough. Raspberry Danish had wonderful flavor.   Overall, spectacular variety, very well laid out and well marked. Posh surroundings.",

The food quality is average at best and while they have a variety of international stations, the offerings are very basic.   I normally clean my plate and leave little waste, however I barely ate half of the foods that I selected. Additionally the service is poor - none of their workers from the cashiers, to the waitstaff, to the line cooks seem to care about the customers. They barely go thru the motions and are very slow.  An example is i grabbed a creme brulee (which wasn't very good) for dessert and I asked the attendant at the dessert area for a spoon as they only provide a fork and knife at the table. She told me they were by the soft serve ice cream machine., but there were none. I told the attendant and she told me to go to the soup area. The soup area also was out. Ended up tying to eat dessert with a fork.   This buffet brought me back to old Vegas where you'd get a somewhat crappy buffet for $9.99 - expect that now it's $30.   Skip this and go next door to the buffet at Paris or spend a few dollars more and go across the street to the buffets at Aria or Bellagio.",

The food didn't look fresh and it didn't taste fresh . I wish I would have taken a picture of the Mexican food area, OMG it was gross! It just looked like the food had been sitting under lamps for hours, not appetizing at all. The desserts were stale, but the soft serve was ok. The only thing I enjoyed was the Mac and cheese, pesto pasta, and the fruit smoothie. In my opinion I would just pay a little more and go to Cesar's buffet. The only reason I gave 2 stars is our absolutely lovely server. The staff really was really nice",

The middle eastern food was probably the best station with the chicken curry and tandoori chicken standing out the most. I haven't really found a buffet on the strip that impresses with the deserts, with this place not quite hitting it either. Overall was satisfying but I'm not going to be raving about it.",

They had Mediterranean, mexican, italian, chinese and american.  (from what I remember).     I mean you can't expect the ribs to be smoked for 12 hours and made with an amazing rub...  it's not a rib place.  It's decent ribs prepared in a manner that's cost effective. As for the rest of the food.  It's good.  It's not the best stuff on earth but it's good.  The one area I wasn't too crazy about was their chinese food.   I really enjoyed their dessert section: too much to choose from.  I left uncomfortably stuffed!!  What made this extra sweet was the groupon deal I got. It saved me alot of money and included alcohol.  pretty awesome.  My big and only gripe was the way in which you are sat.  It's like...  torture almost.  You stand there in line...  pay for your buffet... then stand some more while the hostess seats you.  The place wasn't that packed either so it blew my mind at how long it took for us to be seated.    Thats the only reason I can't give a 4 star experience.",

Food was pretty standard Vegas Buffet fare.... crab legs, prime rib, Asian, Mexican, Italian.  Nothing really stood out but the unlimited drinks were never empty.    While I don't go to buffets for the ambiance this place was lacking.  Kind of a basement like funk with low lights and some random movie posters here and there.  If you are going to go for a theme at least go over the top like the Paris buffet.",

It is a kind of weird set up where you wait in line to buy the buffet then get into another line to wait to be seated.  All in all took us 10-15 minutes to be seated.  The buffet is separated by region.  There is Italian, Mexican, soup, salad, Greek, seafood and dessert.  There was some good food and some not so good food but all in all it was tasty.  The service was pretty slow but they only had one server covering a large area. At one point a server and bus boy were having an argument and management had to come out and take care of it.  They handled everything right out on the floor which I thought was neither the time not place for that right next to our table.",

I was shocked that my husband grabbed the eggs Benedict.  It was so NASTY!!  The place had few people so we should have known better.  The pico de gallo was old and obviously stored for awhile.

Maybe coz I have recently been spoiled living in Boston.  Update: Later that night my fried who was with me threw up and guess what the undigested contents were?   Also, this place is overpriced, with deceptive advertising. All through the casino they are advertising a $12 buffet and when you stand in a line for 5-7 minutes you get stiffed with an almost $60 charge for 2 which is prepaid - so you don't really have an option.

Everything was so full of flavor. My bf loved the prime rib. It was tender and juicy.   They have a super cute display of desserts. I just wanted to eat everything but my bf and I had the 24 hour deal of AYCE so we never wanted to fully stuff ourselves. We had a taste of everything and liked nearly everything.

I honestly thought it was the best buffet in  Vegas, I still think it is, but for $15 cheaper, I rather do the Spice Market Buffet. Same quality, cheaper price.   My favorites at the Spice Market Buffet included the Alaskan Crab legs, the Prime Rib, the boned Short Rib, the Beef Kabob. As you can tell, I love meat. Any meat that was served at this buffet was well prepared because after a week, I can still taste the juiciness of the Prime Rib. I am also a big fan of the Desserts of this buffet. There was this raspberry cheesecake that made me go back for not once, twice...I honestly went back for fourths. THEY HAD A COTTON CANDY MACHINE! That was a first for all the buffets I have been to.   So all in all this buffet was perfect from the multiple arrangements and options. They had Mexican, Italian, Seafood, Middle Eastern, Asian, you name it, they have it. The only reason I am not giving it a perfect 5-Star rating is because it was not like I saw a Shark Tank or had 5-Star furniture. Nonetheless, I came there to eat, and eat I got.",

    "text": "Stop 2 on my Buffet Of Buffet's adventure.  This place was pretty good, very flavorful food, lots of different styles of foods.    Food wise there were lots of options but not a lot of options at each station.  There was a lot of seafood, though i'm not a seafood fan so I didn't have any but if that is your thing you are covered at this place.  Being half Lebanese I went straight to the Middle Eastern station and but fairly upset with what was available.  I picked up the \"Dolmas\" which I had a couple of issues with, 1. They were served cold. 2. They were sitting in some form of oil. 3. They were served with a side of Feta Cheese.  Which that is the Greek way of serving them, not the Middle Eastern way.   I also got some lamb, which I haven't eaten lamb since I was a child.  This lamb however was perfectly cooked.  It was very tender and seasoned perfectly.    I later picked up some roasted turkey, some chicken, some Naan bread, beans and rice, quesadilla.  I had some Mac & Cheese as well but wasn't happy with it at all, it didn't taste right or good.  After we did go to the cupcake station which at first glance it offers tons of different flavors of cupcakes, however most of them were hard, and some of the flavors were not good.  Though I did like the cream puff cupcake enough to have more than 1.  The food was pretty solid, however the service was not great.  Our waitress only gave 1 refill and was away from us most of the time we were in there.  I would return to this place again and suggest it to my friends.",

    "text": "Terrible. That sums up my experience here.   Food used to be so good here, back in the Aladdin days. The seafood was fresh and there was lots of it, all different types. Now you are left with crab legs and shrimp; my guess? both from the same distributor that does all the buffets. In other words, flash frozen, not much flavor, ordinary not extraordinary stuff.   There wasn't one item I ate today that I would consider tasting 'good'. Not excellent, just 'good'. That's how far my standards have fallen here. The prime rib piece that I got was well done. I would say it once had a chance at good flavor, but not when it reached that temperature. The sushi consisted of three types all stacked on top of it other in one tray. Other than that, everything I ate, I literally took one bite of and then stopped. Even my 5 year old son, who loves desserts, stopped after one bite of his creme brulee and fruit tart. He didn't like either. Doesn't that sum it up? And I haven't started with my two major complaints. First is the price. My son, who again is 5, costs a whopping $19.99. That is highway robbery. Our dinners costs $36.99. Again a huge gouge fest. This buffet, in terms of quality and taste, I wouldn't pay more than $9.99.  And since the line was so long, they had an upstairs line, then the escalator, then it continues to a downstairs line. My cousin was waiting in line for us, and she had gotten to the downstairs part. The idiot who was controlling the top of the escalator wouldn't let me pass, even though my cousin was downstairs. In fact he didn't let many people pass, who's families were already in the downstairs line. Do people really f you over so much that you are a dick to all the families? Do you think I'm trying to bs you, as I am pushing my aunt in her wheelchair? Did you think the wheelchair was fake too so I can get some sympathy from you and try to steal my place in the front of the line?   As I write a letter to corporate to complain about this establishment, I will now write the same here on yelp. I will never again visit this buffet, and I would advise any living soul, for as long as I live, never ever come here.",

Meat was dry and the crab legs were still frozen. I eventually gave up on the regular selections and just high tailed it to the desserts, cause those should be good right? Wrong, didn't even finish a cupcake. I went on a weeknight around 8pm. The place was practically empty. In town with so much amazing food i can't think of any reason i would return to this buffet.",

This is the first one I've seen that has a 'Mediterranean' station with kebab and all the fixings.  They also had cotton candy and an extensive dessert bar.  Everything was seasoned just right - not too bland, not too salty/sweet, and it didn't look like things had been sitting out all day. The endless mimosas during the weekend brunch poured freely by our server aren't hurting this review either.  Try it out!",

    "text": "After a bout of severe and heavy-handed drinking (thank you Harrah's), my  sister Katrina K., Dank K., Stephen H. and I were starving. We came to Planet Hollywood not only looking for food to ease our rolling stomachs, but for a buffet that will blow our minds (and taste buds).  Alas! Blow my mind, it did not. However it seemed to blow my wallet away. The line was extremely long - even being tipsy didn't help. Cheery though I was, this line didn't seem to want to budge. I even saw an old-lady try to bribe her way in with $100 but there is no mercy for the buffet -bystanders. She was promptly sent to the back of the line. Ouchhhh. After much waiting, hopping and frequent trips to the bathroom, we finally got into the buffet - SCORE! Although at this point, I was painfully sober and even hungrier.  The food was.... all right.  Typical Vegas AYCE fare with the exception of the King Crab legs. Nothing remarkable or special. I was even disappointed with the desserts. For me, desserts are key. If they put in a lot of work in their desserts then you know that their entrees are doubly good. The Flan tasted off and the Strawberry tart was spoiled by watching this old man pick off all the strawberries and leave the tart there. Really old man. As if the old lady bribing her way out of line was so much better.   However, unlike other Vegas AYCE buffets, the Spice Market Buffet is unique in that it offers a Middle Eastern section, which is a pleasant break from the usual Italian, Seafood and American sections. Their marinated feta cheese was de-LISH.   Other than that, okay-buffet. (hey it rhymed!)",

Carnival has actually gone down in quality now and Spice Market is delicious!  The variety is truly astounding and all the dishes are perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Usually with buffets quality is sacrificed for quantity, Spice Market defies this rule.  Forget all the other BLAND buffets, this is the place to go for great seafood, beef, and ethnic themed dishes and gourmet desserts as well.  I was really impressed by the dessert selection, and the fruit tarts helped!  So did that creme brulee...mmMm !",

Honestly, the only food item I actually enjoyed was the cheese pizza from the Italian station. I, along with my party, continued to try the different foods at each station because we were determined to get full since we didn't want to waste the 90 dollars, but the dishes were either overcooked and dry or flavorless. Eventually, I stopped trying the other foods and just ate a couple slices of the pizza to get full.    There are much better buffets in Vegas. If you really have heart set on a buffet, I'd recommend the buffets at Caesar's Palace, Aria, Paris Las Vegas, or the Bellagio. You'll pay about 10-20 dollars more, but it's well worth it. If you absolutely want to eat at Planet Hollywood, then I'd suggest going to Gordon Ramsay Burgr. You'll spend about the same amount of money and you'll actually enjoy your food.",

At $30/per person for dinner, it is a pricey buffet no matter how you cut it. There was a lot of variety and I got selections from the Asian, American, Mexican and Italian stations.  Not to mention the delicious dessert selections.  The big draws seem to be the seafood station and desert bar.    The place was packed and full of people half in the bag, stuffing their faces and yelling.  Maybe that was part of the reason it didn't wow me.

    "text": "We arrived a little after 3pm with a group of 20, including 16 with Special Needs.  No line, plenty of empty tables and we gave our Groupons and had to pay $2.49 per person extra ( tax?).  They wanted us to pay $100 for gratuity to sit together in the same EMPTY area; another union rule.   More later on that.  I said no problem, we aren't moving since we were already seated, but told them they just lost any additional tip we were planning on leaving above the $100.  This is union policy, I was told again.  Well, keep your union policies.   Those are the workers the union protects..  Good for the union.  The service was awful, the food was just as bad and I would never recommend this place to anybody who has any food taste/class.   As soon as we finished, I had two vomit ( un- sweetened tea must have been off temperature).   None of us ate more than a bit of anything.  Most items weren't labeled so the one with a seafood allergy, ended up with seafood in the pasta.   Not labeled.   Chicken Noodle Soup isn't a selection of soup.  It was the only choice.   Desserts were just awful.   The best was the Ice Cream and it can from a machine.   Don't go,  not recommended; rather stay hungry than eat this rubbish.  Service was terrible, but then again, unions only hire the best workers...wrong...least motivated.... yes!   Fool me once...Never again.",

    "text": "Another buffet? Why the heck not. Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet isn't anything to rave about but if you're looking for a quick buffet and a lower price point, this is your bet.  Cost: Breakfast ~$15.99+* Lunch ~$18.99+* Dinner ~$27.99+* All you drink $11.99* *prices before tax, weekend prices increase by a couple dollars.  Service: Quality if service isn't the best, got in line, paid, with no one ahead of us and the waiter/host were busy talking to one another.  What's good to eat? The brisket and grilled asparagus are the most satisfying in my opinion. The roasted chicken was a little dry for my taste but was seasoned appropriately. Baked potato was very plain, nothing to rave about, does need a potato toppings bar though. The various styles of cuisines didn't seem to blend for me. This would be a place to eat if you're not too worried about the quality.",

    "text": "We got a discounted rate through tix 4 tonight. We were seeing a show in the same hotel and didn't want to walk far so we decided on this buffet. It looked promising with all the different taste stations, but I was disappointed with all of them. Most of the food was just really low quality. A lot of it was not fresh and had been sitting out for a long time. Everything was just kind of dried out or overcooked. I felt like each station was missing basic components you'd expect to see there. The salad bar only had like 4 vegetables, the noodles in the soup had literally turned to mush, and at a taco bar, you'd expect to find stuff to make tacos not weird looking pork tostadas and burnt quesadillas. The pastas were cold so the cheese on top wouldn't melt. Even the deserts didn't look appetizing and I have a killer sweet tooth. They looked like bland, overly processed, chalky cakes. The staff were also kind of rude and really slow. There was no one in front of us and we probably waited 15 minutes for someone to come seat us. Buffets are really hit and miss, and this was definitely a miss. Our group would have been happier having gone to McDonald's or something for dinner. It wasn't even worth the discounted price we paid. I can't imagine paying full price for it.",

Best and worst: the beef at the carving station was tender and flavorful, but the crepes were pre-made so they were a little tough. We used a Groupon that included unlimited beer, wine and champagne, since we came at breakfast time we had mimosas, lots of mimosas! The service was great with the drinks but not as much with clearing the dirty plates from the table. Unlike some buffets, our server made us feel welcome to take our time.

There was a concert (George Clinton) in the theater, so parking was tough and we didn't get to the buffet until 7 PM.  Even though I was completely stuffed from the 6 prior buffets, I somehow found the room to go for a final plate.  This buffet is one of the largest of the 7 and offers Mediterranean fare, which is unique to the other buffets.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=vV2f1x98dos-4W17IMuQBA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2...</a>   I decided to have some Chinese food, Pizza, and Penne Pasta.....had to stick with my No Meat diet and these were the most appetizing items I found.  There's plenty here for omnivores....I'll have to come back when I'm off the wagon. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=pNEmoWdn6iNT-b9VrBJM-w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=4qodQ7gEHBC3bIOLVFgX6g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2ruy5x600SX4avnrFuA?select=xsm1D_pt_lknFpNlUwYXiw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Fi-2...</a>  The food was pretty good.  If I had more room, I'd go for some of the Mediterranean items.....the other Yelpers who tried it said it was pretty good.  I'll take their word for it.  Our server was friendly and kept our glasses full.  We were seated in the middle of the buffet so we had easy access to the entire line of food.  Good stuff.  Return Factor - 90%",

When I walked into the restaurant at 1.00pm there was absolutely no one in line (red flag).  After I was seated the restaurant was only 30% occupied.  Needless to say, the food just sat under the heat lamps forming crusts.  I tried several pasta dishes and they all tasted the same despite the varied descriptions.  The desert bar was overrun with cupcakes.  Cheap, cheap, cheap.  I tried the Flank Steak and it was chewy despite been cooked medium and the Tandoori Chicken was overcooked.  Had they shredded the chicken they could have re-purposed it as shoe laces.   I will not be returning to the Spice Market.  I'd rather pay a little extra money and dine at the Wynn or the Bellagio for a gourmet dining experience.",

On this occasion we were using the Buffet of Buffets pass and I didn't look to see how much Monday morning breakfast was, but what we like about Planet Hollywood's buffet is they have a nice breakfast selection.  I was on some crazy fresh fruit tear that morning, so I got lots of yummy fruit from berries to pineapple to cantaloupe.  I also dug into the oatmeal and there were all kinds of great toppings: craisins, almonds, granola, etc.  My husband had an Egg McMuffin on cheddar cheese steroids and said it was awesome.  And of course, we munched through the usual eggs and sausage and bacon items.  They have a nice bread bar with french toast, pancakes, and waffles with a selection of syrup and toppings as well as donuts.  I passed on my usual biscuits and gravy, but it was there and so were bagels with toppings like lox, tomatoes, cream cheese, etc. and a toast selection.  IN other words, Great breakfast selections.    Good food and good service.  I like that the bathroom is at the same location so you don't have to go traipsing all over the casino to find it.  We like it.  We'll probably be back.  I did have one previous experience there at dinner and on that occasion the food was okay, but it didn't give me an urge to return for dinner.",

The buffet itself is pretty big with buffet stations going from one end of the buffet to the other end. It's comparable to Rio Buffet, but I would still consider Rio buffet the biggest and the longest.  They have a lot of food to choose from, but I do have to say that most of the food didn't taste spectacular. It was alright. Nothing to rave about.  The dessert station wasn't that great! Majority are cupcake items. They also have made to order crepe, but the crepe was already cooked. They just have to warm it up.  Overall, the service was good, but I would have to say that this buffet has more quantity over quality.  TIP: Dine between 2:45 and 3:30 and pay lunch price, so that way you can enjoy dinner food items starting at 3:30. For example, snow crab legs. By the way, the crab legs doesn't taste good. Just alright.  As I said in the beginning, if you guys want to see what kind of food they serve at the Spice Market buffet, I have recorded a full Steady walking tour of Planet Hollywood Buffet:   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-YQIVXMqy8k&s=08c8faabe684240c7cd2e2dfd17b5cefeeb829042fb30064ed9e0b08092d4a50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=-YQI...</a>",

This was NOT amazing.  This was disgusting.  Of all the food I could not even find one thing to get, I decided making a salad would be my safest bet. Yeah right! The salad bar was a joke, gross lettuce, croutons and dressing. Like no veggies!! I made a pathetic excuse for a salad, and ending up filling up on cupcakes.  Which were nothing to write home about either.  The few I had were super dry.  Not only was this buffet gross, it was robbery!!! $70 for the two of us for garbage! Never again, never again. They even try to take your photo upon arrival... can you imagine purchasing one?! No thank you!!!! Don't need a memory of the awfulness that cost us $70",

It's not comparable to the higher class buffets in Vegas, but for it's price range, I wouldn't expect it to be.   The one complaint I had was the dessert station was all cupcakes. I wish there was more variety in the types of dessert offered (I can only eat so much cream cheese frosting, guys.).

We frequent Vegas every 2 - 3 months and wont be returning, gonna try the Aria next. The asian egg noodles and oatmeal cookies we're the highlights for me",

I'd like to give more than 2 stars but I can't. It was really more like a 2.5 experience, but I can't round up because the food was just that lousy.  The only thing that was half way decent was the prime rib, fruit tart, lemon meringue tart, and the stuffed sole. All of the warm items were cold...selections were dim...meats were all tough except for the ones that I just mentioned. Not sure what happened at the Mediterranean station. Why was everything doused in heavy curry spice?? Isn't curry more of an Asian spice?? The curried cauliflower and chicken were both awful. All that I could taste was heavy curry and no other seasonings..really dreadful dishes...the lamb and chicken kabobs were both dry and cold. The grilled squash was cold, slimy and tastless... I could go on and on about the other items that I tried, but I won't bore you with details, but I will tell you that the other offerings were similar. I didn't get around to the salad bar but I think I should have started there first...  I think that SMB is right around $40 per person sans discounts...it's definitely not worth the money. Quality nor selection are there. There are too many other buffets in Vegas that offer much better food at a better price. The Orleans is one.  In all fairness, I'm not a buffet buff, but this is about as bad as it gets...service was at least decent.",

The food was mostly warm or hot. The grilled carrots were the only thing that should have been warm and was not. The greenbeans were oily. We were filled up and it was very good! The mashed potatoes were something I could have ate more of because they were tasty.   My husband is not a sweets guy, and most buffets offer pies/soft serve, so when we didnt find either, it was disappointing for him. I am a sweets person and found the creme brulee to be the best thing I ate. They could have limited the cupcakes and added pie or softserve,   Overall, a very good deal and we were happy to have ate here.",

(yes, added a tip).  Then it took somewhat forever again before someone seated us.    Took off for the buffet, and was seriously UNimpressed!  Favorite part for me (the ONLY part) was the Italian section. Meatballs and sausage were good.  Liked that they had crushed red pepper to kick things up. Broccolini good.  After that I had a hard time finding anything that looked edible.  Even the seafood section was only so-appealing.  Had a couple crab legs (ice cold) and okay.  The other fish selections didn't make me want them.  Husband was raving over a pork taco in the Mexican section.  They were out of them when I went up there.  Later found one and it was okay.  Nobody working there seemed glad to be there (especially the folks replenishing the food).    Kinda sad that I wasted my limited Vegas time and money here, honestly.",

The seafood area is a little bit lacking, but it's still good for food. The inadequate 3 star review is due to the fact that the chefs behind the counters are grouchy and rude to customers. You want two slices of meat? Sigh, roll your eyes and still only give one and pretend you didn't hear. If you're in the bakery and dessert section make sure to be patient. They will look at you, do everything else before making you a crepe or getting you cotton candy. The wait staff is nice though. They go out of their way to help, but I'm not sure. If it's because I'm used to tipping people. When you tip at the front counter after paying to get in they take this large stamp and stamp \"gratuity included\" onto your receipt as they take you to a sitting spot. Because of my inability to directly confront people behind the counter, I was forced to go to only the self serve counters. Personally, I'd probably go somewhere else if you buy the $50 pass to all of the buffets on the strip.",

My favorite thing is the Mexican Street corn which is grilled corn slathered in butter, cheese, & cayenne pepper. Yum! Then, of course, there's the cotton candy at the dessert station. I don't care that I'm 32 years old. I love cotton candy. Hubby's favorite thing is the prime rib.

The drinking station i think was what shined, they had a fountain where you could enjoy most of your favorite beverages.

I found a Groupon surprisingly and we were so excited to where I broke my keto diet for it..they completely changed EVERYTHING!! The seating, the quality of the food which was hometown buffet at best! The buffet is more than HALF the size and the food was awful!!! Poor quality, poor customer service and no crab legs or real seafood! They had tiny shrimp cocktail which tasted mushy and smelled fishy! There were barely any portions in general!! Pizza had been sitting out forever..and the groupon deal we got..was not a deal! I paid $55 them had to pay almost $5 tax at the buffet..the buffet is $26.95 regular price!! So what deal did we get? Wait! They have half the items, the quality is no longer. No crab legs, sushi, Cannoli!..and they still charge you that price? I got totally ripped off! There are many great places to eat in vegas..don't bother with this one. Epic fail!! Bummer:/",

Self serve drink station, which can be plus since you don't have to wait for your server to bring your orders forever (hint Bacchanal).  No crab legs for dinner, which was a bummer.  Food was replenished fast, which was a plus.  Prime rib was juicy and tender, even better than the one I had at Bacchanal Buffet, another plus.  The lamb kebab (or was it beef? Couldn't remember) was dry and tough, but the chicken kebab was juicy and tender.  And... that was about it. Nothing else worth noting. Nothing else that is even worth the holiday Buffet of Buffet pass I paid to gain entry. In fact, for the lack of selection I wouldn't even want to pay $20 for this. But if you don't mind the price, the limited selections, and the mediocre food, Spice Market is actually not a bad choice. Hence 3 stars.",

Just recently visited this buffet again and it was super disappointing. Service was terrible and the food was even worse. There is a very small selection and the food was not fresh. The veggies and meats looked like they had been there for a while. The steak was cooked rare but wasn't cooked throughout the whole piece of meat! Mac n cheese didn't have any taste and the tilapia was over cooked.  No one came to offer us drinks and we stayed for 30 minutes and no one came to clear our table. Another small thing is for the desserts, there weren't any signs so we had to guess what we were picking.  We were charged $25 dollars and left hungry because the food was just so bad. For a hotel like Planet Hollywood, I would have expected a much better buffet with better regulations and services!   Would not recommend going here until something changes!",

Firstly, ALL of their food tastes like it's thrown in a 500 watt microwave. I was highly uncomfortable after encountering ROACHES near the food. The staff is very unfriendly and unwelcoming. When I let the manager know about the roaches she wasn't alarmed AT ALL. She basically implied that it's a regular occurrence, the ROACHES are regular visitors of the buffet & they have regular exterminator visits. After expressing our high uncomfortability and loss of appetite due to the roaches  multiple times, WE had to request a refund. It wasn't even offered by management. Poor quality food, service, and pests. Avoid this place by any means necessary. It makes me question if the whole Planet Hollywood is roach infested as well.

Though the variety wasn't great, they did have an Indian section, which was different than anything I saw at the other buffets, and a Mexican section. I enjoyed both. The chicken fajitas I had from the Mexican sections had good flavor. The dessert portions were small which I liked because it was easier to try a lot of them. All in all, the food wasn't horrible but it was nothing to speak of. I would chose to go somewhere else before I ever came back.",

There's an Asian area, which sorta approximates a tour of Southeatern Asia (with one or two obligatory Indian dishes). There's the Mexican food, Italian/Greek, Middle-East, etc... all well prepared.

I did a lot of research and reading tons of reviews because the hubby and I were only going to be in Vegas for 4 days - each meal was not to be wasted at a so-so establishment.  The most famous thing in Vegas aside from the casinos and the shows is of course the buffets.  Every corner you turn on the strip, there is some huge neon sign advertising the cheap yet plentiful buffets.  On the higher-end side was the Spice Market Buffet - not much advertisement, it was just supposed to be a \"hidden gem\".  The price we paid was somewhere along expensive - $20+ for each person for dinner.  This was a fortune in Vegas when it came to buffet dining.  There must be some exotic and delicious food was the conclusion we came to.  The room was dimly lit.  There was plenty of walking room amongst the tables, probably to avoid head-on collisions amongst patrons.  The selection of food was paltry.  They were known to have \"international fare\" and yet at each of the distinguished stations, they had only a few items.  Now, not only was the number of selections limited, the food they did have was sub-par.  Hot food was warm, cold food was slightly colder than warm.  We were definitely extremely disappointed with our experience here.",

Didn't I look like a big dumb Australian tourist.  The spread of food was pretty damn good, although I am guilty of camping out at the Mexican counter more often than not. The Middle Eastern section was also very tasty, although I can't remember for the life of me what I had. I seem to recall giant skewers of meat.   I give three stars for the food range, and one for my waitress Nina - a lovely mid-50s woman who, once she heard our accents, flirted non-stop and made sure my beer was never empty for long. Thanks Nina! I'll come back and marry you one of these days.",

TIP: definitely splurge on the extra $20 to go eat at WYNN BUFFET. it is SO worth it. i promise :)",

    "text": "I signed up to Yelp just to write a review about this place. It is absolutely AMAZING! We went to a lot of buffets at our week long trip to Vegas and all my friends agree that this was the best buffet we visited. Dinner was $30 and we paid an extra $12 for all you can drink alcohol (Beer, Wine, Champaign).  The food was spectacular. If they have it, try the lamb skewer. I'm not a fan of lamb but it was next to the beef so we decided to grab it. Best lamb ever - hands down! They have a wide variety of food and if you love seafood then you'll love this place. The king crab legs were the best I've seen.  We ended up eating at the Bellagio buffet on our last day since we wanted to not repeat restaurants during our trip. We all regret skipping the Spice Market for the Bellagio. It has no comparison what so ever.",

Course it was 1 year, and the rio has won consistently.   I went there for breakfast on my last day in Vegas. How do I put this? The eggs in their eggs benedict were fried where the yolk was solid, they had corn beef hash that was dry. The orange juice i had ordered was completely watered down. When I went to the buffet to get a smoothie they had actual real orange juice there. wtf? You mean I have to go to the buffet to get real orange juice. And they didn't have a selection of fresh fruit.  Their pastries from P.F. Changs should have been left at the door. P.F. Changs i have a bone to pick with you, but that's later.   The only thing good there was their oatmeal. And its hard to mess that up. The baked oatmeal was good too. I'd pass on this buffet as the quality of it just ain't that great.",

    "text": "I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but the last time I was in Vegas, my bf and I ate here twice! Once for the champagne brunch, and another time just for the breakfast.  Champagne Brunch - What more could you want? It's breakfast, lunch, dessert, and booze. You can stay as long as you want, which means you can drink as much as you want for a great price. The food is good, and if you pass a chip or two to your drink server the drinks will flow freely.  Breakfast - Breakfast for two cost about as much as Starbucks for two. If you in that hung over state of not knowing exactly what it is you need to eat to feel better, this is a good bet. You can have coffee, oj, water, and all the breakfast fare you want. So if you take a bite a something that just doesn't do your tummy right.... no biggie, toss it aside and move on to the next item on your plate.  Overall, Spice Market is awesome.... make a stop for the champagne brunch.",

I came here under protest and time constraints as we needed to be at a concert in less than an hour. We headed downstairs to the buffet and I was optimistic with the international variety they offered. The guacamole and sour cream were the only things that looked good at the Mexican bar. The seafood was watery and bland, although I must admit buffalo sauce with fried shrimp is strangely yummy. Nothing really stands out as \"special\" except the grilled zucchini and yellow squash from the Middle Eastern bar. They were grilled, peppery and cooked to smokey perfection. I went back for seconds and came back with zucchini and a small creme brulee. I should have just stuck with the zucchini...",

We had gotten a 10% discount coupon so that lowered the price. Every little bit helps especially when we're in a recession!  Overall, I think the food is pretty good for a buffet. The dessert crepes were incredible. I had strawberries with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and chocolate syrup drizzled on top. So warm & delectable! Also, the ribs were awesome. They were practically falling off the bone. Finger licking good! I enjoyed the seafood. Crab legs were delicious but a little on the cold side. Shrimp cocktail was yummy. I didn't like the sushi though. Not fresh enough for me.  My man also enjoyed the seafood. He was hoping there would be more authentic dishes in the Mexican section but he liked the build-your-own tacos and their beans.  Servers were very attentive. Constantly clearing our plates and refilling our drinks. It was very busy so that was impressive. I also noticed that there was a sign near the cashier that said,\"Voted Best of Vegas.\"   Yes, it's a bit pricey but it's VEGAS baby. Live a little!",

We waited in line upstairs in the casino only to make it down the escalator to wait even longer in what looked like a holding pen for livestock.  The food was not good.  Most of the displayed food looked dry and flavorless but, in fact, they did have flavor!  It was the flavor of really low-quality buffet food!  The only tasty item was the chocolate-filled crepes topped with peaches and a berry sauce.  They make them fresh at the dessert station.  I'm kinda trashy in that I harbor a shameful enjoyment in Vegas buffets, but if you need to go to one, I suggest the one at the Mirage.",

As I walked up to the cashier, she gave me the price which was about $28 per person, I gladly supplied her with my credit card. She gave me the charge receipt and I wrote the tip amount into the receipt. She took the receipt from me and said there is a problem with me tipping on the card because she already closed the transaction. She said it would be difficult for me to tip on the receipt because she would have to void the transaction and then recharge the transaction. I said that was a silly thing to do. Then she suggested that we just charge the tip amount on the card as a separate transaction. I finally said we would just pay in cash at the table. The service wasn't very helpful to accommodate my payment method.  The seating area was not very spectacular. It felt like a HomeTown buffet, but with a little more class. The food was not very fresh. The lettuce in the salad was rather wilted and didn't taste very good. I tried a little sushi, but the rice was very hard. My sister told me that when she picked the sushi up, the rice already cracked in half.  The prime rib and ribs were average. I do have to say the duck was rather tasty. I think this was the best part of the meal.  I tried some of their dessert, but was also disappointed. I felt the chocolate covered strawberries were rather mushy. As I walked toward the soft serve ice cream machine, I saw the machine being serviced.",

    "text": "So-- I'm a pretty laid back eater... There's not much I don't like and I'm truly not picky... That being said, I thought this buffet was mediocre at absolute best!!! :-/  Reading the mixed reviews, I decided most people giving bad reviews were picky. (Lol)  And I went anyway. After all- I purchased the buffet of buffets pass for $60 w/tax and this was one that was included in the price. So why not go see for myself?   Well.... I went here specifically because I was interested in having some middle eastern cuisine.  In this section, they offered basmati rice, tabouli, couscous, lamb kebab, chicken curry, roasted cauliflower, as well as pita bread, hummus, and tzaziki sauce.  My first plate at the buffet was a full plate of all these things. Everything was average and the curry was a notch above average. I tried everything. Didn't hate it but wasn't impressed. And the basmati rice, which is usually my favorite part, was Crunchy. Flavor was good, but I definitely needed to be cooked longer. :(  The lamb was pretty dry and gristley too, which was disappointing after reading one review about how tender and amazing it was.  They also offered a Mexican, Italian, and Chinese section of which I couldn't find one thing that looked mildly appealing.   I tried out the American section and had the prime rib and \"Yukon\" mashed potatoes (I read a review to try them... Not sure what Yukon style potatoes are and I didn't find out by eating them...? (Just mashed potatoes with a yellow tint)  The prime rib was decent and they offered horseradish and horseradish cream   The seafood seemed to be a pretty high traffic area. Crab legs, mussels, shrimp, etc...  I tried the three of these things. Crab legs were good, the shrimp and mussels.... :-/ One thing that I found alarming-- they were piling new crab legs and shrimp on top of the ones that have been just sitting there. Sure, I said it's a high traffic area, but what happens at the end of the day when I get the bottom of the barrel crab leg that's been there for hours... ? Ew.  Then there's the dessert bar. Sounded promising from Fb reviews. And looked promising(see pics)  BUT it was not as promised. Not at all.  I found myself picking up dessert after dessert and taking only one bite in order to find something that wasn't Golden Corral bland!!!  I must've tried eight different items and opted to save the calories for something satisfying and tasty.  Also, the coffee I got to go along with it was absolutely horrid. So strong that I added the WHOLE carafe of cream and it was still completely undrinkable. I finished my meal, and then one last time checked the reviews on yelp to be sure that I had tried every item people talked about being worth anything.   Then I remembered-- the COTTON CANDY!  Everyone raved about them having cotton candy. So I questioned myself. Could I have possibly missed it?  Right back to the dessert section I went. Still didn't see it. Well I asked the lady working behind the counter and she was very friendly. She Quickly went to the cotton candy machine (located behind the counter and behind the ice cream soft serve machine) and made me my very own cotton candy puff. :-) yay!  THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED THIS PLACE FROM GETTING ONE STAR IS THE COTTON CANDY!!!   I forgot to mention... My server was rude and short with me, but did keep my tea full and my table cleared.  And the OJ tasted funny too.  Hahah did I say I was a laid back eater?????",

I don't eat at many of them and 'Vegas has an incredible variety (both in terms of items, quality and cost).  This buffet didn't disappoint.  LOTS of variety of foods.  Everything seemed fresh.  If you like cupcakes you've come to the right place; I think I counted 10 varieties plus soft-serve Custard.  Not many cakes or cookies though, primarily just fresh cupcakes.  I had a generous helping of Prime Rib and some ham, both were nicely cooked.  I also enjoyed some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in a long time!  The only drawback's I saw were, there is no self-serve beverage station; you must order soft drinks and water from a waiter and sometimes the wait time for a waiter seemed a bit long.  I also thought the cost ($30 a person for dinner on a Thursday night) was high, however the food was good and being on the strip it's probably one of the more affordable buffet's you'll see on the strip.  I'd come here again!",

    "text": "I was pleasant surprise as I have heard that some of the buffets in Vegas are terrible. I went with some of the ladies I was staying with on a Saturday morning for the brunch buffet as we missed the breakfast only. They offered a wide range of food options from breakfast, lunch, and dessert. They had traditional breakfast options such as eggs, waffles, pancakes, and french toast. Along with breakfast they had various lunch options with everything from soup and salads, Asian, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Seafood. They also offered many dessert options from pastries, crepes, and fresh fruit.   Some of my highlights were the french toast which was dipped in cinnamon. The pineapple and cantaloupe were extremely fresh and juicy. Spicy Buffalo Shrimp and this Crab dish I can't think of the name were so good. I thoroughly enjoyed my crepe it would have been nice to just offer strawberry instead of mixed but the banana was good with chocolate sauce.   If your looking for a decent buffet this would be a good option to try. I will recommend that you go get the players card of the casino at Planet Hollywood because the buffet will be cheaper.",

    "text": "We weren't looking for something hoity toity.. and we didn't want to spend $50+ for a buffet meal on New Years Day. This was a solid option aside from the long wait that we experienced to get a table. We were disappointed to peek over the wall and find entire sections of 10-12 dirty tables with one busser slowly working each table, as we stood and waited for a place to sit. The drink servers/table clearers do hustle but they are likely overwhelmed with the amount of tables they have. Our server kept up on drinks once we were able to order them.  Our group didn't do the drink package as we didn't feel it was needed or worth it.   The food? It was just fine.. split crab legs, prime rib that was tasty and not chewy, good fried chicken and plenty of salad options/toppings. They tried to do a little of this, and a little of that.. but it's possible that their quality diminishes because of it - ie. Sushi. Sushi shouldn't be on the buffet unless it's an entire station of just sushi and it's made fresh in front of you by a sushi chef. One platter of sushi on the seafood spread is a little scary to me.   Desserts were all delish.. we had cupcakes and cotton candy and ice cream, as well as flan, mousse cups and more.  While in line, I chatted with the ladies in front of me who indicated that they'd been at the buffet a couple of years ago and it was good. I had hope! It's not horrible.. but it's not like some of the top rated buffets on the strip. Of course, it wasn't $65 for a meal either.. :)",

Spice Market isn't a bad choice, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a good meal in Vegas (no buffet is, actually).  But Spice Market has a huge assortment of ok food.  Food that I can remember:  Crab legs Can't mess this up, as long as they serve this I'm happy.  They're cold, btw.  Caesar salad Good but not fresh  Homemade piza One bite of this is all you need, not good at all  Asian station Egg rolls were great, pot stickers were ok, drunken noodles had almost no heat (makes sense if feeding many people with different tastes) but that didn't stop me from going back for seconds, good kung pao chicken.  American stuff Turkey and prime rib with an attentive carver (both good), BBQ pork ribs were really fatty and the BBQ sauce was too sweet and tomatoey, sliders were decent but the buns weren't fresh and a little hard.  Middle Eastern Lamb kabobs and chicken kabobs that were pre-kabobed and cut into little pieces.  Both good.  Baklava at this station was also really good.  I passed on the Mexican but they had fajitas!  Desserts Tried every option but only finished the flan, creme brulee, fruit tarts, and the sugar-full cookie.  Ice cream machine was broken (sad face).",

The food pleasantly surprised us, better than Kumi in Mandalay Bay (sad to say). But the unlimited drinks such as the wine, was kind if nasty. They come in water glasses so they don't have to bring you more and more and the wine tastes dirty, like cheap wine does. But the food was totally worth the money. They had a lot of things vegetarians would eat, since i have recently become one ( 6 weeks now), with salad and pastas, grilled veggies and seafood, even cheese quesadillas. Of course they do have the standard meat options and some Brazilian style skewers as well. Worth the try, very underestimated.",

Offerings for breakfast were just A-OK (as denoted by rating)...I don't remember anything memorable here; they serve lunch fares during breakfast hours and the dessert station is filled.  One note on food:  * Pork taco in Mexican-fare station = Odd. Their pork filling was char-isu pork, def not your usual taco (but it wasn't good).  Was it their attempt to mimic the food-truck crossovers in Cali?  Service, however, was very friendly & engaging.  Sadly, this is the only redeeming factor at this buffet.",

Highlights: Prime rib is good and the basmati rice. Everything else, nothing special. You get your bacon and eggs, which again is nothing special. Asian food selections are not very appetizing, Italian food - the lasagna tasted like something that comes from a can. I find that the $36 per person is not worth the food you are getting here. You can tell that there was no love and care for the food they serve. Service, non existent. Very disappointing. It's a one and done deal.",

But honestly... for 35 bucks a person... cant they at least serve steak? lobster? something thats actually worth 35 bucks?! The lines were sooooo long. I think no matter when you go, the line will be long. we got lucky and didnt have to wait long since we had a group of 9 people and ended up seated in the back in like a banquet type area for large groups. There was alot of fruit selections and ice cream and cotton candy for dessert. Overall is was a 3.5... but I'd rather give it a 3 since it really wasnt worth 35 bucks.",

This was our first buffet stop while using the 24 hour buffet pass.   The whole reason that we went to this particular buffet was because we wanted to have lunch at the Paris next door but the line was way too long. - Oh little did I know that the line that we saw was only the tip of the ice berg. There is a line to wait in line. Who does that!? - It reminds me of the line ride on The Simpsons! haha  Anyways... On to the review of the food. This is what should really matter!   The sections were separated by the geographical region of the food. From what I noticed... this buffet likes to really stick with the most generic and popular food dishes for the given country. If you're looking for something a little more \"exotic\" then this is surely not the buffet for you.   The food was bland for the most part. Nothing to really write home about.   None of it was really too memorable for me other than the soft serve custard. I would have had more if I wasn't to full at that point in our meal.   Eating here made us too full to face another buffet for dinner time while using our 24 our buffet pass. What a shame...   :'(",

    "text": "To mix things up a little on my last trip to Las Vegas, we decided to hit up the Spice Market Buffet at the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino (formerly Alladin).  It was voted the Best Buffet in Vegas in 2007, so I had high expectations and an even HUGE(r) appetite for king crab legs...  I wanted to like the Spice Market Buffet because, well, it's a buffet! All you can eat baby! Yeah.   So, we arrive and (1) the escalator on the way down to the buffet is broken. So everyone (senior citizens, parents teaching their children how to walk for the first time) was walking down the escalator VERY SLOWLY. OK, escalators are entitled to break down every once in a while, but during their 4pm Dinner rush hour? Hmmmm.  We pay for our buffets first and are quickly ushered to our seats near the seafood area. Nice! Upon obtaining our plates, there is a LONG (and slow-moving) LINE for the crablegs. Hmmm. What's the hold up? Oh, the people cutting in line in front of those of us patiently waiting... while the crab leg attendant does nothing to regulate...  We are seated and greeted by our lovely server who takes our drink orders and ensures we are comfortable. Nice.  My crab legs are a little too watery (poorly thawed) and VERY salty to say the least. But I continue consuming them... until after about 20 or so legs I am satisfied.  They also have various other foods some distinguished by ethnic group, and of course prime rib-- which was delicious.  Overall, a good value ($24.99 per person) for a dinner buffet. Professional and friendly wait staff (ask for Ginger from Jersey). But not quite as good as the Wynn's Buffet.",

Contrary to other's comments, this is not the same price as the Bellagio buffet. I ate there the night before and it was $36. This was $22. Granted it was brunch, but it only gets up to about $27 at dinner I believe. Nevertheless, the brunch was well worth the money. It was not as elegant as the Bellagio which is my fave, but the variety was great and the flavors were on point.   They have differen ethnic stations and blah, blah, blah. They had some fun seafood options, the desserts were surprisingly decent even though they didn't look it. All in all, I will definitely be back here because they have great variety and we can't afford to spend $70 on buffets and wait in line for an hour to get in. Sorry Bellagio, you're still my fave, but I'll have to come back when the line finally dies down.",

Be aware that if you have a party of 6 or larger they automatically charge you gratuity.

The pizza in the Italian section was good I heard, but the lobster risotto was the bomb!

I went here in 2009 and paid the $27.99 for dinner and I guess was just not thrilled in general with the experience. I thought yeah a bit overpriced. This time I got a free $20 voucher to use at any harrah's property from one of those games.  I got here right before the lunch ended at 4Pm and got to use my redemption.   Food was alright this time, hahaha. Got to make my way around all the different food areas: mexican, Asian, italian, Seafood.  The crab legs were definitely on point. Better in fact here than at some other buffet location as well.   I recommend come here prefer lunch to me, but it was still a good deal.  Line wait was actually not that bad but I have seen it completely packed. I guess because it was still the transition from lunch to dinner, was just lucky to still get put under the lunch category and not pay anything extra with my voucher. -I will definitely go back next trip to the area. I look forward to those crab legs again and chinese food section. I went here the last day of my trip so I was a bit sad because I knew this was the last food I would consume in las vegas. It was time to end all the fun.",

She was so rude to us and literally yelled at my friend for pulling a chair up to our booth when she arrived later than the rest of us.  WTF?  She was really snotty and told my friend she couldn't sit there.  Either she had to move to a different table or squeeze in one side with two others.  I don't see what is so wrong about pulling up a chair to make a 4-person booth fit 5.  It really ticked off the waitress for some reason and consequently I had to eat my brunch squeezed in like a sardine, while one end of the table was completely empty.  Plus it took them FOREVER to get rid of our empty plates so eventually we had to pile them on the table next to us.  And they didn't fill up our waters.  Summary:  go for the food, it is great!

Dont get me wrong, they get top points for range, cleanliness, great table spacing (not all crammed together) and rate of turn over to get people seated and presentation...but the deciding factor, the food was crap.  We do appreciate that is more of an American cultural thing that food isn't as heavily flavored - we're lived and traveled all over the world and American food is generally famous for its blandness. But HOW can you have a buffet with foreign food and make that bland too?  We tried a breakfast and a lunch buffet - we wanted to give the buffet the benefit of the doubt and try it again to make sure it wasn't as bad as the first day - and it was. 80% of what we took, we ended up not eating.  Kudos does go to the dessert section, the Mexican section and the fresh roasts. The rest was pretty below edible.  We had fried shrimp that was still FROZEN in the middle, and tasted like dirty grease on the outside (unfortunately dirty grease was as far as any flavour went), Asian fried rice whose rice was only about 1/3 cooked, stir frys with no flavor, Mediterranean food that would make the Mediterranean's weep with sorrow, fish that had a similar textural consistency to bathroom grout..and the same taste I assume too, and vegetables that you wonder how long they sat in the truck in the desert before they made it to the table.  Tell me I'm up myself...I don't care. But when you're paying $45+ for 2 people to eat international food, you expect at least some of it to be edible.  All I can say is that we had a buffet at the Silver Legacy in Reno that ran rings around this place... RENO people. What does that have to say about this place?  Save your $$ and go to Starbucks.... at least you can trust that Starbucks will taste like something...",

My boyfriend and I went to the Spice Market buffet totally on a whim on our first night in town last week.  We were very pleasantly surprised not only by the quantity of the food served but also by the quality.  Two of the highlights were the pizza (which was considerably better than some pizza I have ordered and paid for from an actual PIZZA joint) and the Middle Eastern food station.  That section had the best hummus my boyfriend found on our entire trip along with tandoori chicken, naan, dolmas, baba ghanoush, and other assorted things that you don't often find on a buffet line (or if you do, it's usually gross).  The desserts were also high-quality and delicious.  One of the nicest things about this buffet was that it was organized better than most any other we went to during the week (perhaps with the exception of the Carnival World Buffet at Rio).  Every food station is clearly marked and stays within the boundaries of a certain theme (Mexican, Italian, etc.) - you'd think this was just a no-brainer, but try navigating the buffet at Paris (where half of the food is un-labeled) and tell me how much you appreciate it.  If you can only go to ONE buffet while you're in Vegas, go to the Bellagio.  But if you plan to visit TWO of them, make sure the Spice Market Buffet is on the list.",

You line up; pay; go down some stairs; line up again; wait for waitress to bring you to your table.. then finally get food only to find yourself lining up again.    Cost for two people was $50 after a $5 off coupon per person.  Food was mediocre, nothing that tasteful.  At first glance, there seems to be a lot of variety but nothing really stood out. The king crab legs were good but the line for it was ridiculously long.   Some of the things I remembered: - Soup: too salty - shrimp tempura: too much of the crunchy flour part compared to the tiny shrimp in it (think about how much oil that thing absorbs) - kung pao chicken: tooooo salty - salmon: DO NOT TOUCH; being a salmon lover, I should have know better than tried \"soy sauce salmon\".. wtf was I thinking? ....  After two plates and a few desserts, I gave up. Thank god for good company or else it would have been 1 star.  Maybe I'll try one of those more expensive, 3+ hour wait buffets next time.",

The selection is huge since they have all sorts of different cuisines. The crab legs tasted a little artificial, but apart from that, the food was all really decent.  There are plenty of other great buffets in Vegas, so go to those ones instead.",

The warm crab legs are good (you have to ask the staff to heat them) but nothing to write home about. The Tandoori chicken is constantly coming out the oven so it's extremely fresh. That was the highlight of my meal!!  The prime rib is not the same quality of cut that you experience at Paris or Bellagio. It might be the way it's cooked because it is dry and au jus is a must. Some of the Asian counter foods sit out for too long that it doesn't look as appetizing.  The baked potato stand is not bad as you can customize your stuffed potato to your liking.  Desserts continue to disappoint as they don't have any warm desserts like apple pie. An occasional creme bulee pops up but otherwise it's a counter of slices of room temperature pies and cookies.",

I was really sad that there was no omelet station; I think there used to be one! I also wasn't impressed with their Asian food or their breakfast selection. The line to get into the buffet also looked massive humongous, and if you're seated at one of the tables near the line, people will just keep looking over the partition at you, hoping to hurry you up. I liked the Middle Eastern food section, but that was about it. I would say go for the brunch buffet at the Wynn or Bellagio if you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "First of all, I've been here a few times before using the buffet of buffets, which is definitely worth the price if you're in town for more than a day. Again, I brought a group of 10 here on our way back to Salt Lake and thought the $30 was decent and within our budget. Unfortunately I didn't realize they charged 20% gratuity for that large a group, and it came out to about $40 per person. Definitely not worth $40.   As far as food, I love the split crab legs. That is practically all I ate while I was there, with a piece of prime rib and some other random food. I typically don't eat carbs at buffets, and I'm not a dessert fan. Their arnold palmer was really good though. The service is good, and the split snow crab legs were good, but it was hit and miss. Sometimes the batch would be dry, other times they would be moist and flavorful. Can't really complain at a buffet although my $40 says otherwise. The prime rib was decent, not the best I've had but ok. Their desserts looked good and I had a bite here and there of some, but nothing impressive. Their pizza didn't look all that great so I didn't bother and their Mexican is sparse but the middle eastern was decent. I liked the lamb. The tilapia was surprisingly flavorful. They have a large fruit selection and overall a wide food selection but it definitely a certain umf.   Overall I would go here with the buffet of buffets pass but other than that I can find better food for $40.",

If you are a crab lover, you should definitely visit this buffet, for $27 you can not beat the deal.  They have the Alasking King, and snow crab legs, legs are already pre-cut, so you don't have to worry about anything except eating them.  Rest of the food is not bad. They have really good chicken noodle soup.  If you are not a crab eater, well i don't think it is worth paying $27.   The biggest letdown was the desserts. Tasteless, and not worth spending the time to eat them.",

Of course , the most expensive and worthwhile is the seafood so of course you would load up on seafood . However , there is a long line and a very little and poor selection of seafood . The American and dessert selection wasn't that great . The Italian selection was pretty good though . The food was decent , but not that great . I don't think it's worth your money .

I came here for the dinner and was immediately bummed out that they gave out coupons for this place! So yeah I was stuck paying full price for not doing my homework.   Back to me being a picky eater, that's a problem with me at buffet's is that I don't feel I get all my moneys worth for all the food they have.

I dont care what anyone says, loved them. I came back for 2nd's and 3rd's while cutting anyone ahead of me in line) -Dessert Station (also good, cream puffs, carrot cake, cotton candy, cookies were all on point)  If you're not a picky eater like me then you'll get more than your moneys worth in my opinion.

I agreed with the win cuz the food was decent and the desserts were exceptional.  Now, 2014 - This buffet will NEVER win that award again.  This dinner buffet is cheaper than other buffets on the strip and you get Below Average food.  Even the desserts aren't as good, majority were cupcakes - I don't care for cupcakes.  I want some good stuff like tiramisu, gelato, cookies, etc.  I love cookies and they had Zero/None.  Line was super long, it was line after line - first line to pay then line to get seated.  There was only 1 person walking groups/people to their seats.  Even some waiters had to come by to seat people cuz everyone was getting frustrated about the wait.  We got there at 5:20, didn't get seated 'til 6:30.  I wouldn't come back here again; don't waste your $ here.",

    "text": "OK this buffet gets one star simply because there's not an option for no star, this was the absolute worst buffet I've ever had in my life. Honestly I don't even see how a buffet could be bad because there's got to be something they could do right. I got a deal on Groupon for beer, wine, and champagne unlimited, and the buffet. Since beer, wine, and champagne are all free in the casino I don't consider that a bonus. The buffet seriously, I would've been mad if I had paid full price but I still wasn't happy paying what the Groupon was worth. I waited an hour and a half after getting through a line and waiting to be seated. I then waited 15 min for the brunch buffet to be done so that I could eat the lunch buffet which was supposed to be better and wasn't, we left eating nothing. Everything was bad from the poor selection of food to their crab legs that were still frozen and mushy. If you gave me the buffet for free I still would've left this place not eating and would've chosen a Hometown buffet over eating there because they even have a better selection at Hometown buffet, and I don't even care for a Hometown buffet. I did inform the manager Joshua, of how felt and he was very apologetic and said had I not gotten a Groupon he would've refunded it. I've never asked for a refund from Groupon but I did on this one and I did refund it.  My suggestion is compare your buffet to other decent buffets and try to step it up. Definitely make sure that you don't put frozen products out to eat. If you can accomplish that I may try you again in the future because there are quite a few shows that I would like to see a Planet Hollywood, and it's a nice casino.",

I didn't even have space for dessert unfortunately b/c they all looked scrumptious.

Seriously, when I pay, I at the very least expect somewhat decent food.  Well, low and behold, after finally arriving in Las Vegas around 7:30 in the morning, I was famished and wanted to eat something! Anything! Being that my friend and I stayed at Planet Hollywood (what it is now), he did some gambling and actually got himself a voucher for a free buffet. So, why the heck not? Even though in the back of my mind, I did cringe a little when it was mentioned because of the horrible time I had last time. We were off!  The buffet was around $14 and change. I was surprised that they had a make-your-own-waffle station (you actually ask one of the cooks to put the batter into the waffle maker and wait), make-your-own-omelette station  (same premise, but you get a small array of veggies - onions, mushrooms, green peppers, ham, and cheese). I don't know what's happened to me, but after taking a nicely, freshly made waffle (with the \"PH\" Planet Hollywood logo on it), my omelette, roast beef with horseradish sauce, bacon, and sausage, I was done. No more! The thing I did notice, I actually enjoyed the food! If you're staying here and want a decent breakfast buffet, this is were I'd probably go to.",

I will say, like most of the buffets that it was only half full, but had a twenty minute wait to get in. Can we please learn to staff these buffets with more waiters???

They offer Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Seafood. They also have a nice dessert station with cotton candy! The line does get really long during lunch and dinner. One time I had to wait in the casino area before getting to wait in the actual line downstairs in the buffet area. I recommend coming early to avoid the long wait.   Sign up for the Total Rewards card to get a discount on the 24 hr buffet pass. It's free to sign up and it will save you about $5 per pass. The Total Rewards desk is near the buffet so you can quickly signup and head straight to Spice Market.   My top two buffet in Vegas is this place and the Carnival World buffet at the Rio. The Carnival World buffet is also part of the 24 hr deal. So if you get the 24 hr pass from Spice Market you can also go to the Carnival World buffet and eat as much you want for as long as you want within 24 hours!",

The staff was friendly and kept our table clean - that is only the upside of the buffet. They need to ramp it up or close it down. We went to the M resort in Henderson (Sept. 15, 2018) and ate at their buffet. Not only did they have cold and steamed crab legs, they were all you can eat crab legs on that Saturday night.

We had the all you can drink, mind you it was bottled beer and not draft beer which I thought was a plus.  We will definitely be going back to this place next time were in Vegas. A lot of people make bad reviews about many places, but never judge by others judge by your own experiences.  Recommend this place 100%",

Desserts used to be amazing and while still tasty, they've basically turned everything into a cupcake, which I find really strange.  Creme Brulee is still good.  If you like pie you are out of luck because they had none.   We had a groupon and I was glad as I'm not sure I'd be happy paying full price for this buffet.  A good deal with the groupon. Biggest complaint was because we had a large party (12) they charged us 18% gratuity ($40!!!!!) which is waaaaaaaaay to high for the service at any buffet, let alone that our server was not good at all.  She forgot drinks (never brought them) and was very unfriendly.  She did not deserve $40 and I feel this was very unnecessary.  Next time we'll request 2 separate tables so we can leave the appropriate tip for service rendered.",

Sushi was horrible. This is possibly the worse sushi I've ever eaten. They really need to take this off the menu. I'd rather buy and eat sushi from walgreens than from Spice Market Buffet.  I probably would have went for breakfast, but never got the chance. We stayed at Planet Hollywood for a week and never went back to this buffet. Too many other good choices.",

At 7:45 am the food on the hot line was barely warm, scrambled eggs had the watery separation issues you often see.  Although there was an omelet station - it was not manned.  I waited 2 minutes and then toasted a bagel (at the station) and no one attempted to assist me. Therefore unable to review.  The Eggs Benedict was again lukewarm (current theme again) the eggs cooked well down, but the hollandaise was very good - but as I don't enjoy hard cooked eggs I only had 2 bites.  I did enjoyed my bagel and lox, as I assembled it myself I controlled what was on it.   The Orange juice was very good.  If we had actually paid for the meal... we would've demanded a refund.  The 2 stars are for the bagel/lox  O.J. And the service.  Bacon was ok (a tad greasy, but it is BACON, what do you expect?).",

    "text": "It's been years since I've been to the Spice Market. I have fond memories when the casino was Alladin, before it changed to Planet Hollywood. Over the years, the quality of their food and level of service has declined.   Recently, we decided to take a spontaneous, gluttony trip to Vegas, hitting a few buffets. Coincidentally, we found a Groupon for a couple of places: Spice Market & Paris' Le Village (which I'll review separately) The deal for the Spice Market includes a bucket of beer (4 bottles of Miller, which normally sell for $7.)   We arrived around 4pm and were immediately seated. I asked the server if we can substitute the bucket of beer for a couple of cappucinos. She responded the \"caps\" were reserved for VIP's only, but she'll try and speak to management.   Wow, sounds serious! After 10 minutes, she returns w/ 2 mugs of half filled liquid with foam and proudly says, \" Management has agreed to let you have these cappuccinos.\"  Oh really??? I felt so honored we were allowed to have this coffee drink even though we weren't VIP's. The way I see it, the 2 cappuccinos probably cost them 50 cents to make, thus saving them money over the beer, so management should have come out to thank us.   Even worse, the caps were the absolute worst I've ever had. After 2 sips, I was done. I've even had cappuccinos made by machines at the Mercedes dealership that were a million times better. If they serve these to VIP's expect them to jump ship to another casino. It would be rather insulting after dropping some cash at this casino and be served this mug of crap.   On to the food. Surprisingly, the prime rib was very tender and perfectly cooked to a medium rare. A bit of au jus and black pepper made this the highlight of the dining experience. Unfortunately, this is where the compliments stop. Everything else had the quality of something you might find at Hometown Buffet. It wasn't disgusting, but nothing at all was memorable.   They used to offer many types of desserts and freshly baked, soft cookies. Now, cupcakes. That's it. Cupcakes and a lot of it. It's a 5 year old fad consisting of regular cake batter & heavy, colorful frosting on top to dress it up. I passed.   Service was less than impressive. They weren't busy, yet our server would walk to her \"area\", point at her designated  tables and shout, \" You OK there?\" Perhaps that was her way of asking if we needed anything. Hmmm.... how about our money back?   This is 2.5 star tops. I clicked on 3 stars to be generous (and for the prime rib). I'm thinking... there's no need to go back for the next several years and will probably read Yelp reviews to check if there are any improvements.",

The wait was brief, friendly service and clean dining area. The waitress was hysterical! She sounded fresh of the boat from Texas and was a great server--keeping us topped off on drinks and keeping the table cleared of stacked dishes.   Buffet food is always suspect for quality meat and items. This place uses a god quality distributor and had toast prime rib to be sliced along with the typical ham and turkey breast. I was excited to try a bite of this and a bite of that. The East Indian cuisine was delightful. The curry wasn't too hot but rich & spicy. Lots of tasty treats, fresh hummus as well.   We ordered the groupon with unlimited beer & wine which was a waste as we weren't saving room for booze during this trip. The dishes were clean and the seating area is well maintained. I would return anytime :)",

We were on line for 45mins even when we could see there were empty tables because the staff couldn't get them cleaned fast enough and the front of the house couldn't coordinate with the waitstaff.    When we were finally seated, our waiter was nowhere to be seen.  I saw a waitress, for another table of course, who was carrying a platter of hot towels with lemons on top of them, but I guess those were for patrons who were paying more for their food than we were.  They had a great many different stations, but really, someone thought they were serving Chinese food?  Did anyone even consult a Chinese?  And the seafood, what a laugh.  Do people know that almost all the buffets in Vegas have shrimp and  snow crab legs.  I know it's fashionable to be skinny but I don't want crabs that were on a diet.  My husband says that for all the stink of the seafood, there weren't enough meat on them to compensate.    We didn't stay around too long.  When we thought about the $70 (including tip) that we paid, we left with a slight tummy ache (and not from a full stomach) but it was better than trying to eat the mush.  There was food spilled all around the stations that no one cleaned up and pasta that came up as one lump when I tried to grab some with the tongs.  It was better to leave than to sit there and get upset.  Never going back there again.",

You will feel like a fat person cause you're going to be eating a lot. Arrived here for dinner and it wasn't too crowded. Our server (the person who gets you your drinks) kept ignoring our table, which was quite annoying. We saw people who were seated after us get their drinks before we got ours. Some food was just plain awful, like the chicken. It tasted like I was chewing rubber.   The line wasn't too bad but when it gets busy, good luck.

For instance, the creamed chipped beef and corned beef hash are all made fresh. While at Harrahs, and the others, it is from a can. The Flamingo has gone up in standards a bit, but Harrah's and Paris have gone down hill some. If you are going to do the 24 hour buffet I would do PH as your main choice to eat.   For dinner, they have the best choices of all the other buffets and really do the crab legs well with both warm and cold legs. They also have peel and eat shrimp already peeled for you. That little step saves a ton of mess and time. It is worth the crab legs just to eat there.   Service is friendly and the staff were attentive to us. If you are Diamond or Platinum they make sure you are taken care of right away.    Make no mistake PH doesn't get five stars because it is not on the caliber of MGM or Bellagio.

Though creative, each station only had a few dishes for each theme, which limitis the buffet.    My husband complained that the crab legs were undercooked.  He was not impressed by their selection of seafood, however this is not a seafood buffet.  I had a roast pork that was very juicy, but nothing spectacular.

The seafood is just cheap shrimp and other cheap items. Salad smelled like raw dish so we acoised that. Asian food was like a two out of five. Very sweet and Americanized. Low quality chicken used.",

I don't know that I'd necessarily visit this buffet again (as Rachel S. noted, the interior is pretty drab and is reminiscent of a hospital cafeteria).  The food wasn't much better than what you would get at a Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral.  BUT...bonus points to our waitress; she was super sweet and before she got off her shift, she snuck over and left me with an entire BOTTLE of my own champagne. What a doll!",

    "text": "Vegas is a place for silliness, and classiness. The Spice Market delivers on both counts. You wait in line for about an hour, go through a shimmering archway, down an escalator to. .  HOLY #$@$ is that another line?!?!? Fortunately for you it's only an extra 20 minutes. Plenty of time to release the inner child by playing patty cake, reliving sports punishment exercises, and ad libing the music videos running on the tvs which for some reason do NOT match the songs in the restaurant. But enough about the wait. . .  The Food- LIKE- the Spice Market has HOT crab legs. They even offered Snow crab and Alaskan King Crab when I went. (most other buffets only offer one type, and it's served cold)  LIKE- their dessert includes a crepe bar, and COTTON CANDY!!! perfect for cotton candy moustaches, followed by cotton candy paper cone unicorn pictures LIKE- unlike most other buffets, they keep things simple, but in doing so, they manage to season the food more perfectly than most other buffets.  DISLIKE- the lack of selection is a little off putting. If you have a group of picky eaters, and you are looking at paying more than $20 for this experience, there is a good bet that unless you are planning to eat $20 worth of salad and desserts, you might not get your monies worth.   The Service- WOW!!!! The only Las Vegas buffet that I have been to where the service was stellar and the servers actually, at a buffet deserved a 20% tip. We didn't have to ask for anything twice, and quite often, we wouldn't have to ask at all for anything! The most off putting thing about buffets is that used plates pile up on tables, but not here.   Great place to go to with delicious simple food. However, I think Mandalay Bay is till my fav. . they have Macaroons. . .",

The decorations at the dessert bar made me not want to eat anymore. Service was meh. They weren't the best at clearing the plates but I guess that's expected when they're most likely understaffed.

We actually got in pretty quick, waited maybe 5 minutes. Space is a little cramped, none of the food items ran out while I was there. I tried a little of everything and the general consensus was bland.   The miso soup tasted off, not exactly what you expect from it. Sauteed veggies needed flavor, mac n cheese was decent but needed bread crumbs or something to kick it up. The pastas were bland, curry cauliflower needed more spice, the premade salads were overdressed and not in a good way. The lasagna was mostly just ground meat without enough cheese to actually balance it.  I'd say the things I actually liked were the stuffed sole, the mashed potatoes, and the mac n cheese since the sole was actually tasty and the other two had easily fixable issues. Black pepper seemed to be the easiest way to go about it really.   Necessary for recovery from the night, but I think I'll venture elsewhere the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "This was the best buffet in Vegas over 10 years ago, then got a little worse, and now it's just so-so, and smaller.  Their traffic also decreased over the years and now the place is half empty. This could be due to competition from Bacchanal buffet at Caesar's and Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, but I also feel it's due to the lowering of the quality. They're now in a loop of having to decrease selection due to less customers, which in turn brings even less customers and causes further decreases of food selection and quality. Now you can't find here as much as a baked or sweet potato.  Forget about crab legs, sushi, fried shrimp, mushrooms and other dishes they had in the past. Years ago they also had the best and most impressive selection of desserts that later they kept decreasing and switching for silly cupcakes. Later they added better desserts back and now they have a few desserts that are still very good. Though we found a small bug in one of the desserts, and a hair in a yellow melon. The only thing that got better is the price, which dropped by a few dollars to $25.99 for dinner, mainly due to lack of crab legs. We (family of 4) still like this place, maybe for nostalgic reasons, and will be back to see if it will still improve. Though right now the new Medley buffet at Orleans seems like our top choice for lower-priced buffets near the Vegas strip, while Cosmo also looks good for medium-priced ones. Too bad the Spice Market Buffet no longer carries much status. (we visited Saturday January 6 2018 for dinner)",

We should have checked yelp first.) Everything was extremely bland and low quality. My wife's omelette was completely inedible - she said it tasted like the oil they used to cook it in was rancid. The only thing we were able to eat was the bacon, which was actually decent for a buffet, hash towns, and French toast (which was in the Mexican section next to the Fajita/taco meat, which had no shells, tortillas or chops to it it with.) The staff was friendly and our server kept our drinks topped off and plates (of mostly uneaten nasty good) cleared. Definitely not worth $25 a person. Also, don't expect to do anything for the next few hours or so, and certainly don't eat this before getting on a plane. You'll end up in the lavatory most of the flight.   On a more positive note, we had breakfast at Pampas Churrascaria Brazilian Grille in the shops attached to Planet Hollywood yesterday and it was one hundred times better, AND it was only $10 per person.

And quite surprised at the mimimune selection, poor quality and poor customer service. Though the waiters were nice. Not the servers. For the price I expected a lot better, The tritip was practically cold. When I returned to get a fresh piece , it also was just slightly warm. And when I asked the server to heat it or cut me a piece from the new cut on the board. She argued with me. That she had to use up the older piece first.Unbelievable . The lamb was also just warm and very chewy. While we were seated I observed the meat rack had about 6 skewers cooked just sitting on the warmer . And was never touched for at least a half hour. Meaning it was getting dried out. The Mexican section was a joke, looked like fast food. Save your money. I don't understand how this buffet stays in business , except for tourist like us that don't know any better. though the deserts weren't too bad. Ive been to a lot of buffets and for less money. This was the worst one I've ever been too. And won't be back. We were celebrating our 29 anniversary . Im very sorry I didn't make a better choice for dinner. This was last week on a Monday night.",

    "text": "I've had better at a university dining hall.  Service is good.  I'd read some good reviews elsewhere about this buffet, but they must've been really old.  This buffet is literally in a basement and the food quality is as well.  Selection was limited by it's small size, but limited in some odd ways.  For instance, the half a station dedicated to asian food had fried rice, egg rolls, hot honey chicken wings and pork buns...um...where's the entree?  Fish and chips and no tartar sauce.  just odd.  The food was dry and just barely warm.  The turkey breast and chicken skewer were inedible.  The steamed pork bun was crispy on the outside (no it wasn't supposed to be) and the paper on the bottom had literally fused into the bun.  I ate half the paper before realizing what had happened.  The best item on the menu has the plain cheese quesadilla...if you take one from the middle, because the ones piled high in the pan are cold.  You get the picture.  Drinks were self-serve, which I have not seen at a buffet.  For a $25 dinner, I'd expect some service.  Speaking of service, the attendants were very friendly and helpful and spent time getting to know the guests.   Dessert was adequate and would be great if you love cupcakes...almost everything was cupcakes.  If you find yourself in Vegas and want a buffet, don't come here.  For an affordable alternative, try Station Casinos.  Far better food and half the price.  There are plenty of other good options on the strip as well.",

Planet Hollywood is quick and cheep. No line (for a reason, it sucks). We had a great server, there is no lack of that but for food it's all cold, not good, lacking flavor, and boring. Don't waste your time, go to the Paris next door",

We went at lunch for the Groupon deal which included 37.98 for all you can drink for two with your two buffet entries. Even before we got there the price alone sold us.   When we arrived we had a short wait in line, nothing too crazy. Were seated quickly and immediately hopped on the food line. Oh boy was I impressed with the selection.   The middle eastern section was by far my favorite, and this is mainly because I've found it extremely hard to find a buffet that can pull it off correctly. But this is the one! As far as the American food... Two must haves - Mac and Cheese, and their Au Gratin Garlic Potatoes...Wow, was I drooling right after our meal...  One thing that does annoy me about the Soup bars here in Vegas, its almost always Chicken noodle and Minestrone wherever we go. How about some Tomato Bisque or Broccoli Cheddar soup! Variety!  The only negative things I would say is that there service was decent. Nothing spectacular from our server but nothing terrible so it was slightly above average.  He could have been a bit better but was personal and didn't get behind even though they started getting busy. Even though gratuity was included with our deal, we still tipped....even though he was Patriots fan haha.  All in all,  you can't beat the price and compared to the other buffets on the strip, this one didn't fall short on food category for myself! TRY IT!",

California Roll was the only thing available and I could get better sushi at a grocery store. The rice was thick and chewy. The Prime Rib was overcooked. If you like your meat medium, with barely any pink, even at the thickest part of the roast, then you might like this. The Mediterranean Station was unappealing. The meat from the kabob was tough. The Mexican Station was deserted. Not much assortment, and all dried out. Will definitely not be going back.",

But anyway, our experience was horrible from the moment we walked in and wanted to purchase a buffet dinner for two. The horrible cashier that attended us (her name was Veronica) gave us such a bad attitude when we were simply asking about the Buffet of Buffets pass. Literally talking down to us the whole time. After leaving, my boyfriend and I looked at each other and were like was that real life? She was so so rude. It ruined what could have been a nice lunch. Right after leaving the cashier we were asked if we wanted our picture taken by a lady with a camera. We politely declined and she rudely just left. The staff here needs a serious attitude check. The food was not great and not bad, just ok. Absolutely not eating here next time we're in Vegas.",

The food was typical of most Vegas buffets. The prime rib was the best item. They also had mismatched food labels, probably from the night before. Yes, I know bacon when when I see it. But a couple of dishes I wasn't sure of, but the labels would say \"bbq ribs\" or \"fried chicken\" when the dish obviously wasn't either. I've had better and worse Vegas buffets.

Bugs were flying around and landing on a lot of the food. Food was flavorless and horrible texture. They had lamb kabobs. My plan was to eat that to make up for all the other bad food. It was so hard to cut through. I kept making that screeching noise when the knife hits the plate because it was so tough (kabob was sliding everywhere). Pass. Will never go again.

The prime rib was to die for, tender and juicy and just plain fantastic. The fish and chips were also really good, crispy and not oily at all (plus the plating was very cute!)

    "text": "One of my top choices for buffets in Las Vegas - and I have tried almost all of them. Spice Market Buffet offers a great variety of great tasting food for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. If you want to save some money print out the $5 coupon from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.destinationcoupons.com%2Fnevada%2Flas_vegas%2Fspice-market-buffet%2Fspice-market-buffet-coupons.asp&s=9b56b57547e2c0398123d2a51cecd93a63d069442a4d8c17bb8140646065f851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">destinationcoupons.com/n...</a> - I've used it on several occasions and it's always worked. Make sure to show your Total Rewards Card if you joined the casino to save even more.   At breakfast they have traditional favorites like pancakes, waffles, french toast, scrambled eggs, salmon and lox with bagels, oatmeal and fruit, etc. Some nice additions are eggs benedict - you won't find this at every buffet breakfast, and an omelet station. For lunch/dinner they have prime rib, turkey, salads, mexican food, Mediterranean food, seafood including crab legs, paella and cocktail shrimp, asian cuisine, and italian including pastas and fresh from the oven pizzas. And of course they have desserts - notably, made to order crepes, cotton candy and soft serve custard.   I think this buffet is a good buy for your money - there aren't a lot of \"exotic\" foods that you would find at buffets like the Wynn or Caesars - however, the selection is delicious and you can't go wrong.",

Rice in the Asian section had dried up and the rather lame sushi in the seafood area was actually changing color. Desserts were mainly pastries and were the bright spot in this experience.

I love the prime rib with au jus and the pesto pasta. There are lots of room to move around each station; they separate stations by type/country of food. On both ends are the salad and soup bars; desserts in the middle. Along the stretch of yumminess, there is Mexican food, Italian food, Chinese food, middle eastern food, Mediterranean food, and American food, which includes the carving station and omelet station, along with other breakfast foods since it was brunch. The drinks are self serve. There wasn't a lot of seafood, but I don't really eat much seafood, so this buffet was great for me. It was also reasonably priced; I got it on Groupon for 45$ for 2 people, good for brunch or dinner. Definitely adding this to the go more often list. The end.",

Looked at all th food sections and they all looked mediocre at best. It's edible but for the money, almost anywhere else is better.  The seafood section looked \"old\". Was afraid to eat anything there in fear of getting sick. It just didn't look good at all. Prime rib was chewy. Food trays were either near empty or full. Meaning anything decent was almost gone or the full trays were bad tasting.  Either way, I'm definitely not eating hear again. Sorry PH, not trying to bad-mouth you but I had a really bad experience eating here.",

My favorite items were the mac and cheese, crab claws, meatloaf, and gyoza. Everything else that I tried was just okay.  In the mornings they make omelettes for you and have other breakfast items. However most of them don't look better than average. I stuck with an omelette and some potatoes with bacon which were very good. Their far right side isn't open in the mornings.",

    "text": "So I went here once before on a buffet of buffets  a couple years ago I believe for dinner but apparently never wrote a review for it. However this time I went for breakfast because I was already going to the Walgreens right next to here to get some drinks so I figured I might as well hit another buffet. I came right at 7am when they opened. Apparently they were doing some half off thing so it was only $10 for breakfast instead of the full $20. Which is probably a good thing because I'm not sure that this buffet would be worth $20. It's a very straight forward simple buffet. There was waffles, french toast, pancakes, smoked salmon station, scrambled eggs, and  oatmeal as well as hash browns. The pancakes were blah but the waffles and french toast were passable. I was surprised at how good the scrambled eggs actually were as most places they're dry and flavorless. There was a dessert station that had a variety of breakfast pastries but none of them really looked that spectacular. The winner at this buffet was the banana smoothie that they had at the fruit station.",

The Spice Market Buffet is located inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and runs anywhere from $30-35 depending on Lunch/Dinner, we went here on a Sunday and the dinner price was the same lunch $32....You can also pay a little extra and do the 24 hour buffet for like $45-50 and you can come back to this buffet or go to any of the participating 24/7 Buffet locations listed when you buy this offer.  So why do they call this the Spice Market Buffet? - they try to make it an International food affair by having separate buffet areas from Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, American, etc...  Best Entrees - Crab Legs (really good Alaskan legs) - Beef Burger (it was surprisingly good) - Middle Eastern (dolmas, dips, and naan) - Tandoori Kabobs (fresh out of the oven every 15mins) - Prime Rib (served by Chef includes dipping sauces) - Lamb Cuts (really juicy)  Stay Away From Me - All the American Food (expect for the burger) - Mexican Food (so bland made taco bell look like Maggiano's) - Asian Ribs (the smell from the sauce made me want to vomit) - Crepe (no effort, was eating raw dough)  Best Desserts (awesome selection of cakes) - Banana Cream Pie - White Chip Macadamia Cookie - Pecan Pie  My favorite buffet in Vegas is the Wynn but this is a close 2nd and 3rd and the price is right at low $30's so you can't really complain as the food isn't great but it is good....so if your close by you can't go wrong with the Spice Market Buffet Yo!",

Everything was visibly past when it should have been swapped out for fresh food.   The rest of my party enjoyed the middle eastern food quite a bit. Everything else was sub par and not very enjoyable. The desserts were okay however. The salad bar only had four types of toppings. This was odd.   The service was not good. Although I will admit this was mostly because they were understaffed. When we ordered our first round of drinks (we paid for unlimited alcohol) she told us \"it's going to be a while. I have three new tables.\" She didn't lie. It was a while. Dirty dishes did not get picked up, drinks didn't get refilled and the unlimited alcohol was cheap and awful. I don't expect top shelf. But at least better than $5 bottles of champagne when you are paying as much as you are typically for a meal here.   I would not return here.",

Many items were crusted over and I was applaud to see the staff members refill the hummus by pouring  \"fresher\" ( from container under refrigerated table) On to the top of the crusted over hummus.   Lettuce was due for a refill among the other cold items such as the lamb.   When asked to speak to a manger, the server returned to seek out the why. As the manager needed to know why she had to come over to speak to us.  The manager could not be bothered to find out why.  Instead when our sever returned to her the 3rd time to explain the situation that I was burned by the improperly set up carving station she called paramedics.  A bit dramatic when all I wanted to do was bring her attention to the problem to avoid others getting a more serious injury.  Talk about one extreme to the other.   I can't believe I paid for this both physically and financially.   Her delay and unprofessional response was shocking.  How can she not be empathetic. Instead she successfully ruined my friends birthday by making us late to the concert.  $200 a piece for front row tickets and had to go buy another dinner after words.  Been a better waste of money putting the cost of this trash buffet down on a table at least  it would of been fun. Stay away from PH all together.",

There were some things that stood out that made this buffet very nice. So lets dig into this review.  I honestly can not think of any negatives other then the food being maybe average or a little under. However you will easily be able to find something you do like, I did. You walk in and you are literally surrounded by all the different sections of food. All sections are as follows, salad, Mexican, soup, middle eastern, American, Asian, Italian, seafood, and dessert, told you there are a lot. On top of all the different types of food they do have some unique foods that my girlfriend noticed right away artichoke hearts, grape leaves and tabbouleh.   When entering this buffet you will notice the dim ambiance. It has sort of an intimate feeling. The seating is nice, feels more like a restaurant then a buffet honestly. I do enjoy how spread out the food was. If I remember correctly the buffet bar took up three walls.  Lots of food, nice seating, many different varieties of food, and comfortable environment make this buffet a safe bet. There are so many buffets in Vegas that are actually bad, however this one is worth the price. Another interesting thing is that they actually have an alcohol section with beers and wines, which you can also buy an all you can drink pass...it is Vegas.",

For the price, I enjoyed myself! Overall- Try these things: -Crab legs:  Diamond and 7 star members can ask for a plate of steamed crab for their table. When I say plate... It's more like a tray filled with crab goodness. Nice if you have a big group! -Meatballs: CRAP (not in a bad way), they were good! I'm not normally an Italian eater, but I couldn't resist and was also tempted by the Fresh pepperoni pizza- another yummy choice btw. -Berry salad with lemon cream. Might sound strange, but the lemon flavor is very faint. It was more sweet than sour! -Meat: O glorious meat. I ate a lot of prime rib. And ribs. And... everything at the carving station for that matter. The prime rib was the best of the bunch. -Salad and desserts: Not as memorable as other buffets.   Don't judge. Just try.",

The variety they has wasn't bad and I especially liked the prime rib the most since it was served medium rare and wasn't tough or chewy like the one at Paris buffet. The crab legs were also good and I was only able to eat a few since I was so tired of eating the same foods after three buffets.  The interesting new items I tried were the country fried chicken in little small baskets which was tasteless and very bland. It was moist and juicy, but lacked any flavor. I also was able to try the fish and chips also served in small baskets and it also lacked any real flavor. It seriously needed some tarter sauce to help give it some taste.  The dessert area looked great with the many different kinds of cupcakes they had with multiple flavors to choose from. Too bad I wasn't able to sample any, but I did have the vanilla ice cream and it was just terrific. I'm not sure how they make it from custard cream, but it makes a big difference from your standard ice cream. It was very smooth and creamy like. My gf had the cotton candy from here and it was a nice big size plus I was surprised she was able to finish it after her meal.   Good buffet option for me to come here again the next time in Vegas and to come here first on my next tour of buffet of buffets.",

Buffet is set up in sections. Mexican, Asian, Italian, Seafood, Mediterranean, salad and desserts. Hopefully I'm not leaving any out. The Italian and Mediterranean were fantastic! Especially the Mediterranean: lamb, mango chutney, best feta I've ever had. However, Mexican, and Asian were not up to par for me.  Desserts were also awesome. Another minor minor complaint, was the utensils to grab food at the buffet are metal and they are in very hot dishes. So sometimes the metal utensils are too hot to grab. Maybe I'm the only one!   I would go again, but stick with Italian, Mediterranean and desserts.",

The cashiers here are super slow, now I understand that people with high level players cards get to go first BUT come on. It's not hard to take money!! When we finally got up to pay I found out my daughter was $19.99, she's 4!!! I guess if your kid eats pure crab, I'm talking pounds it MIGHT be worth it but I don't know of any 4y/o's that will eat $20 in food!! The groupon was already purchased or else we would have left.   As soon as we were shown to our table I made a a b - line for the crab. I had to go to the soup area for a dish for butter. When I got back to the table I picked out all the meat from the split crab legs. I went to dip some crab in butter and it tasted awful. The butter was cold and gross. Here I am with some tasty crab but now I have to walk across the whole buffet to get butter. Now to this point I thought it was my fault, that I let it get cold. NOPE the next portion I got was room temp. at best. I said screw it and gave my crab to hubby who doesn't use butter.   So now I went to search for food. The only things that really stood put was the prime rib, lamb kabob, potatoes au gratin, and  mac n cheese. All the food on the chinese, italian, greek, and seafood area looked old, dried up, or just plain gross.   So the dessert area looked promising. Although having 14 different varieties of cupcakes seems down right stupid. They had flan, creme brulee, fruit tarts, soft serve, pre made crepes, and cotton candy to name a few. The 2 cupcakes I tried were inedible. They pre make the crepe pancakes put them in a dish and when you order one they heat it up and put mushy bananas or runny store bought macerated strawberries inside.  It was not good. The flan was okay and my kids loved the cotton candy.   I left this place feeling like a dog with its tail between it's legs.  And I had a BOGO!  I feel bad for anyone paying the same per person here as Bellagio, Wynn, cosmo, or even Bacchanal. Again DO NOT EAT HERE go to any of the other casinos I listed that do have GREAT buffets. Oh man I'm pissed I wasted $80 after tip. And if you read my reviews I am NOT a penny pincher at all. I'm praying they refund my groupon lol",

I like everything from In N' Out to organic free range beef.  I just like food that tastes good, the end.   And when I am hungover and starving, I am incredible easy to please when it comes to food. So, Sunday morning in Vegas I could have eaten just about anything and have been happy. However, I took one bite of each thing on my plate- which was a sampling from each different cuisine \"area,\" and couldn't stomach a second bite of anything. It was so incredibly gross, there is no other word for it. I was in a group of five people and we all could not believe how disgusting the food was.  We all left hungry- from a buffet!!  I really can't understand how anyone could give this buffet a positive review on Yelp.  I can only hope that I can save someone their $25 by stopping them from eating here. We almost warned the people in line as we were leaving.  The only good part about our meal was our server, Nina, who was so friendly and sweet and amazing, we didn't have the heart to tell her how bad the food was. Plus it's not like she cooked it, anyway. So, this one star is for you, Nina!",

Next round, my weakness, boiled shrimp. Unlike many buffet boiled shrimp offerings, these were perfectly cooked, not soggy. I tried the spicy chicken from the Asian section & it was decent. Husband's favorite was the lamb kabobs from the Mediterranean area. Desserts were so-so. All in all, this was neither a great, nor a horrible buffet.",

If it were not for those two reasons, I would not recommend going.   The high point--- Free champagne...and lots of it! The server was awesome!  The low point---When you finally get through the line upstairs you just get downstairs to realize you have another winding line to wait it! That sucked, and then to top it off the food was just ok. I am guessing there are better brunches in Vegas then this one!",

I was impressed by the Middle Eastern section, because that is rare at most buffets. The seafood had different things as far as fried seafood, pasta other creations I had never tasted.   The Mexican and Asian foods were limited, but what they had tasted pretty good. There were so many desserts it was hard to decide. If you come to Vegas with a group, this would be a good place to satisfy everyones personal request for different foods.",

Their crab legs have been much improved over the past years and their other seafood dishes were decent to say the least.  I really liked their beef shank dish that was cooked in some kind of wine/soy sauce.  It was really tender and GREAT.  I didnt enjoy their prime rib, like most other buffets but they had some good middle eastern style food.  I would suggest this place to anyone seeking a real vegas style buffet.  However, I really don't understand \"best in LV\" signs because i felt the Wynn or bellagio was probably better in terms of quality and ambiance for a few bucks more.",

    "text": "Being of the ethnic persuasion, I love spice.  I mean, the spicer the better I always say!  But for some reason, this particular spice buffet was somewhat watered down on the spices and not as ethnic as I had hoped.  Next time I'll have to take my Tapatio sauce and a couple chili peppers to top it off.  Nevertheless, I appreciated the effort of a sprinked paprika or jalapeno sauce every here and there.  Proved to make it a thematic and worthwhile experience.    Their around the world \"spice\" set-up they had going was very \"it's a small world after all\" theme.  I particularly enjoyed their Middle Eastern section and the kabobs -- it's actually very hard to find a good kabob these days and I was pleasantly surprised.  They even had lamb ... I was stolked!   Their dessert section lacked some \"umpf\" but hopefully you'll have already stuffed so much shrimp and tacos down, that you don't feel like you missed out on much.    If you stay at Planet Hollywood, you get a discount (I forget how much) but overall, it runs about $25-$30/person, so remember to pull your room card out.  Not too bad as far as prices go on buffets in Vegas and the wait isn't that bad either.  Enjoy those spicey tuna rolls!",

I was eating alone and was offered a tiny table right by the hostess desk.  I asked for another table and was offered one in the back next to several families with small children.  Not the best welcome!  Thank goodness the food was very good and the waiter was attentive and  friendly which more than made up for the hostess.  All of the food was very good and almost seemed over ambitious for a buffet.  Most could have been outstanding if they didn't have to sit on the buffet.

    "text": "So not impressed. If I wanted to spend this much on brunch, I would've gone somewhere better, but no, the people in the group wanted this place. I think we should've questioned her taste buds since she was slightly sick/congested.   The place had different stations. There was American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, a Salad station, Seafood, Desserts, and MIddle Eastern, which included Indian food because apparently India is not Asia according to Planet Hollywood.   The line was quite long, but it was around brunch/lunch so my party and I waited in line, which didn't seem that long of a wait. Or maybe it didn't seem that long since they had TVs playing a Nets game and people were all about Lin, but I digress. Once we paid, the total came to $31, we had to wait to be seated, which again didn't seem so long a wait. We marked out drink orders on a paper and went off in search of belly fulfilling food. I got the usual breakfast food: eggs benedict, bacon (a lot of it since I don't really eat bacon lol), as well as some fruit and harsh browns. Another plate contained stuff from the Middle Eastern station, like some chicken curry, basmati rice, their lamb stuffed tomato thing, and pita and hummus. Well have to say, I enjoyed the breakfast stuff, aside from the non-runny eggs benedict and was kinda disappointed in the Middle Eastern station. I found the food at that station a bit bland and asking \"Where is the spice that makes this whatever it is suppose to be?!\"   Luckily there were drinks, although the OJ was a bit warm for my liking. And the mimosas were more like an Orangina than a mimosa. We asked for water, but that didn't come till later. I almost thought the poor server forgot. Anyways, I went back to the buffet to see what else I could eat. I didn't find much too appealing cause I was a bit full, but I soldiered on. I went back for a crepe which was at the dessert station. They didn't have any strawberries (big boo to that!!!) so I settled with cherries topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I found it a bit blah; too chocolatey and the cherry filling was a bit off putting for me.   I got another fruit of plate and found I was more satisfied with fruit than I was with anything else. I could've gotten it and a decent mimosa somewhere else or found better food at other buffets on and off the strip. Aside from the fruit, I liked the cotton candy :)  I like buffets in Vegas, but not this one.",

    "text": "We came here on a Sunday for lunch. More than $50 for the two of us because of the \"holiday\" weekend  (Memorial Day).   It was about 3pm, so there were a lot of empty tables. We paid and were told to stand behind two other parties and wait to be seated. A few minutes passed before those people were seated by a woman who never returned, and then we proceeded to wait...and wait....and wait some more. After ten more minutes, a large queue had formed behind us and we were all asking the cashiers where the host was. She said the host was \"on her way\" but no one ever appeared. A handful of employees and waiters passed the long line of angry customers, and NO ONE seated us. All the employees were looking at each other in confusion, but no one took charge.  We were finally seated in a nearly empty dining room by Luis. My husband and I informed him we had been waiting for over 15 minutes to be seated and asked for an explanation. He just kept saying the large open area of seating was \"closed\" (for no apparent reason) and that they couldn't find Joy, the lady who usually seats people. He nodded along to our complaints and said he would \"tell Joy.\" How about you tell management that Joy is not doing her job?  The buffet itself is average. The sushi was bad and so was the \"Italian\" food. Their only strong suit is the dessert bar--it's full of tons of cupcake flavors, ice cream and cotton candy.   I'd never been to Planet Hollywood before, and this is absolutely my last time at their buffet and casino. Don't waste your money on mediocre food and TERRIBLE service.",

My family will not return to The Spice Market Buffet until the upscale desserts have returned. What used to make this buffet worth the trip is now gone.",

It shouldn't have taken no more than 4. It took so long because every few minutes we had to pull over so he could throw up. He couldn't even keep water down. He'd take a sip, we'd pull over, he'd puke up water.  HE COULDN'T EVEN KEEP ICE CHIPS DOWN.  Also, the food wasn't that great. Nothing to write home about. And it was fairly expensive. I can't remember exactly how much it was, but I do recall the distinct feeling that I was getting RIPPED THE EFFE OFF.  If you want a good buffet, go to the one at the Rio. That's the best one. Best food and best bang for your buck. Most of the other ones are overrated.",

I usually try a little bit of everything, and it was all tasty, but went especially for the wide variety of sea food.  Couldn't wait to get to the desserts, mostly the cotton candy, the first time I'd seen this at a buffet.

Which basically is 24 hours of unlimited buffets at any of the Harrahs Hotel group buffets. We opted to go here cause the line for Paris' was way to long.  Wow I can just say me and my friends were very disappointed. While they have a lot of different types of food (Salads, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Asian, Seafood, American, Italian, and Desserts) the quality was just abysmal. As I was walking around and checking out what i wanted to try, I had a very difficult time actually putting stuff on my plate, because the food just did not look appetizing at all. In the end, I tried to get a couple of different items and each was just taste disgusting and just I just couldn't finish. I thought the desserts might redeem the buffet but even though the desserts looked decent, they tasted just horrible. I can say the only thing I liked from the buffet was the watermelon. Some of my friends who I came with are not at all picky eaters and even they thought the place was just gross.  Please save your money and try another buffet, you'll thank me later.",

Mexican and Mediterranean section were barely touched and looked like it was sitting there for awhile.   Dessert section was sad. Cupcakes were rock hard, crepes weren't fresh, they take premade crepes and cook them in butter add some banana mixture and Nutella in it.   My friend said the cooks there looked like they didn't care for the food quality, which I could agree on because the look and taste of the food says it all.

We got here at 10:57 pm and had three minutes to pay and 30 more minutes to get our plates before they packed it up. The couple behind us got turned away and she told them most buffets on the strip were now closed. I think there are a few open 24.  My husband and son had been to Vegas last year for a car show and bought the wrist band that gives you access to more food than you need and putting that wrist band on is almost like accepting a challenge to make it pay big, so at least if you lose all your money in the casino, by God you will make it up on that wristband of 'all you can eat'. Challenge accepted.   We did learn we could have shown our Harrah's card and gotten the wristbands for $44. We paid $55. Not sure why, but the next morning the woman told us they charge different prices at different times with no explanation, but with the Harrah's club card, its the cheapest.   Now we REALLY wanted to make it pay. It is True you get sick of buffet food by the next day. My husband took us here because last time they were here, everyone said this IS the best buffet. Honestly, they really do all taste the same.   We had one of the casino workers tell us she loved Harrah's hated Bally's. I was like really why? She said she didn't like walking so far between the stations. We ate at the Paris Buffet for lunch and Harrah's for dinner and a breakfast.   Nothing off the charts, but still pretty good selection for the most part.",

One man was with his girlfriend/wife significant other and the other with his entire family. For some reason Indian man gets mad at Arab dude for being an Arab dude, cause he's loud and letting family members family members cut in, which started the whole thing. So they go to almost throwing blows cause Arab man can't let it go. Says \"I would buy you\" bitch, you're eating at a cheap ass buffer, picking up receipts off the ground trying to get freebies. I saw your sandy ass. Anyway, Security comes calms everyone down, then they seat the Indian man and his significant other first. Fifteen minutes later Indian man comes walking by with a plate of food while Arab man and family are still waiting and angry. Arab man talks some ish to the guy as he walks by, Indian guy ignores it and smiles. Good for him. So now they go to sit the Arab family down and they put them at a table right next to his opponent. Lmfao what the hell are you thinking Spice Market employee. So now Arab guy knows where Indian guy is sitting, and starts harassing him there. He said some words as he walked passed, again, calm as a Hindu cow, Indian man did nothing but smile. That's called winning folks. Security asks him about it, I see three guards run over to Arab guy, they're all arguing, but i can tell the situation, they're getting removed. So I finish my terrible meal, I'm not even going to go into details cause at this point, all that matters in this restaurant is not getting blown up at this point.  My wife and I decide it better to finish out plates and leave before it gets even more escalated and then, KABOOM.  This was all over a course of 2 hours, 60 minutes of waiting in line, front row fight seats, than another 45 of deciding what to eat and wait for our drinks, 15 minutes to discuss and ultimately decide, never get a Spice Market Groupon again.

We wanted a buffet for our last night in Vegas during the 4th of July weekend, but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg. Everywhere else was charging $50+/pp, so when I saw the Groupon for this buffet I thought I scored ($95 for 4 buffet dinners w/ unlimited beer/wine). Get there, and there's a short line- no biggie. Get a table and immediately start walking around the food options. Nothing really looked appetizing, but I'd grab small portions of stuff that I thought I'd like. Most of the food was luke warm and bland. The quality of the food wasn't much better than a Hometown Buffet. Lesson learned, if I want a decent buffet I'm going to have to pay at least $45.",

With how expensive the buffet is there should at least one complimentary drink. I spent 50 bucks to get into the buffet I would get at least one drink on the house. Our table was also completely cleared off while we were getting food and we had to be reseated. Super inconvenient but not too big of a deal in the end.

I am Indian so was excited when I saw tandoori chicken, chicken curry and naan at the buffet but I was extremely disappointed. The tandoori chicken was absolutely not marinated, they just added a crap ton of red coloring to make it look appetizing. The naan is not really naan but just pita bread...False advertising?  Out of all the sections, I probably liked the seafood section the most but was a little careful because I didn't want to eat too much seafood and get a stomach ache later. The Asian section was horrible! The lo mein was so dry and the chicken looked rubbery and fake, again...I was extremely disappointed.  I could keep going on and on about all the crap food but I think you get the idea. The best part of the entire buffet was our server. She was very sweet and the only reason I'm giving Spice Market a star is because of her.  Weekend lunch price is $30.99+tax/person and that is definitely a rip off. For the quality of the food, it should be more like $9.99/person.  Kinda bummed that we shelled out so much $$$ for horrible food but it happens and at least we gave these so called amazing buffets a shot...never again.",

I enjoyed several pastas, stir fry, a couple Asian chicken dishes, and one of the best peanutbutter chocolate cupcakes I've ever had. If I hadn't gotten so full, I would have had another! I left full and satisfied. All the food was fresh, hot, and well prepared. Not sure it would be worth full price, but at coupon price it was on par with most of the neighboring buffets.",

They have about 8 different stations of food, each one with a different nationality. Their middle eastern station was delicious. Their tandoori chicken and lamb sliders were mouthwatering! Cooked just right, not too spicy and with the right sides it makes for a great plate.   I tried some Italian dishes like the spaghetti and meatballs but those weren't anything out of this world. The American section really was my least favorite. I tried a slice of the oven baked turkey and it was like chewing on sandpaper. No taste whatsoever and don't even get me started on the fried chicken. I've had better at Publix!   All in all, it's a good buffet. I recommend the dinner time buffet over the breakfast one but get ready to stand for a good hour before you actually put anything into your mouth.",

Either way, the champagne brunch was really not worth the price. Crab legs? None. Oysters? Nada. Champagne? Creme brulee? Nowhere to be found.  Still, the food was worthy of 3 stars. I knocked one star off for service. When we were being seated, the host was a little condescending toward my Uncle for no apparent reason. Once we were seated, our waitress never once checked to see if our glasses needed to be refilled. We literally had to hunt her down for refills the entire meal, and when we did get her attention it was easily a 10-15 minute wait for refills. Often instead of helping her tables she was chatting with her co-workers.   Our plates were also not cleared very often.  FINAL VERDICT: edible, inattentive service, but really not worth the money",

I had the shrimp tempura, sliders, chorizo beans, carne asada, glazed chicken wings. All of these were delicious.  I know steamed rice is a simple item, but this is the best steamed rice I have ever had.  They are individually packed in a small Chinese to go box. Smells great and tastes great too.  Their chicken & biscuit in a basket looked cute, but the biscuit was hard and dry. The chicken was juicy, tender and fresh.   For dessert I had the apple crepe, which is made to order.  The crepe itself is pre-made, but the chef put butter in the pan and warmed up the crepe and put apples in it.  The whipped cream was delicious too.  I also had the Baklava, which was excellent.",

The Middle eastern food was good as well.  I enjoyed the Humus, tabouleh, lamb.  The chicken was a bit dry so get some sauce for it.  Soup selection was poor.  We tried a number of desserts and most were OK.  I liked the souffle.  I doubt I will return.    Too many better places in Vegas for a buffet!  I'd be willing to pay more for a better experience.",

    "text": "For the price, I thought this buffet was just okay. Price for dinner was about $30. Yes, they have crab legs. Pardon me if I don't get all a-twitter over that. Lots of buffets have crab legs. I actually think the best dish I had was the salmon with a soy glaze. That was actually quite delicious.   Despite the fact that it's a buffet, I still like to get some salad with my meats, and I thought the salad fixings here were minimal. (Most were prepared salads, not raw salad fixings.) Kind of disappointing.   Chinese food selection was shady looking, so I didn't go there. Mediterranean section was very nice, although I think the baba ganoush was a bit off.   Prime rib was ok (much better at the Golden Nugget, if you can believe that) and the dessert section was also just okay. The yams were fabulous!  If you're going to do buffets while in Vegas, maybe get the \"buffet of buffets\" pass (around $45, I think) which gives you 24 hours of buffet eating at any of the Harrah's properties. If you hit 2 buffets in 24hours, it takes the sting out of the prices. If you aren't going to hit 2 buffets in that 24 hours, don't do it. (Also, now that there's no buffet at Bally's you may see more traffic at Spice Market and Paris .. so be prepared for lines at peak dining times.)",

If you choose that option go with bottled beer, then it is a good deal.  $33.99 for age 11 and up and $19.99 for age 10 and under seemed a bit steep especially with all of the trial and error we went through to find tasty food.  The service with clearing plates and replenishing beverages was just OK.  Don't tip when you check in, wait to see if your server is attentive and tip at the end.  The kids enjoyed experience.

Wait: I've been to Spice Market a half dozen times over the last decade and this meal was a far cry from the flavorful buffet I remembered from past visits. The wait was long, which I expected, but we were briskly instructed to move along in the downstairs maze by a cashier, which I found to be unnecessary (felt a little like cattle!). Once I paid for two dinner buffets ($67 for two adults...dang), we waited another 10 minutes before being directed to our table.   Service: We loaded up on our first plates...no utensils initially required since we went for Mexican fare. Good thing, since no server came by. I had to ask one of the employees directing people to their seats for our silverware. Halfway through our second plate we finally managed to wave our server down to get drinks. Which were never refilled.   Food: I used to love the Spice Market for its good quality and variety (which one should expect for the price). Mediocre at best, truly. Lots of lukewarm, borderline bland dishes. The Middle Eastern station was best, with decent dolmas and Moroccan vegetable dish. Dessert were also fine, but Italian, Seafood, and Mexican were pretty crummy. Big bummer, since I'd been awaiting a gigantic, amazing feast after a 10 day climbing trip - AND it was nearly the equivalent of my entire food purchases over the previous week of adventures.   Will DEFINITELY avoid this buffet on future trips.",

We actually went there twice that day since we had the 24-hr pass buffet.The champagne kept on coming at brunch and of course free of charge, the waitress did not even give us time to ask her for anything she was always around. The service was impeccable. A lot of food to choose from. Can't wait to visit again.",

The snow crab was okay, it smelled a little fishy, but no amonia taste, and the paella was really chewy. Most upsetting was the price. I also purchased a all you drink ticket, and after the first serving of drinks the wait-staff avoided us like the plague. Fruits and desserts were very disappointing. This buffet really needs a make-over and staffed with personell who care about the diners experience. My wife Caroline and I also had dinner at Caesars Baccanal and  breakfast at Paris Le Buffet and then dinner. These two rated far above Spice Market with Caesar's Baccanal getting top honors.",

For 27.99 I could have spent a few dollars more and have gone to Wynn.  It's really generic buffet food.  It really reminds me of Rio's buffet.

While the buffet at Planet Hollywood has a wide variety (including a Mediterranean station) it lacks any semblance of quality and has scant offerings for vegetarians or pescetarians (people who eat fish and veggies).  So, here's why it gets one star: The sushi rice was undercooked and firm.  The sushi had a rubbery texture. The shrimp tempura was crispy, yet cold. The crab legs on the self service bar were cold and could either be blanched in hot water, or taken to eat chilled at the table.  Chilled should not mean the crab legs are frozen in the center. The Asian station had absolutely no vegetarian offerings, other than the steamed (and undercooked) rice. The soups were only mediocre. The vegetables on skewers in the Mediterranean station sit on a cutting board that is shared with meat.  And the baklava was stale.  It also lacked sweetness or filling other than the phyllo dough. The Mexican station allowed you to make your own taco.  The had rice.  Can you guess...undercooked.  Thankfully, we got this meal as a comp.  I wouldn't pay the hefty price tag for dinner.  I would rather go to a sit down restaurant and get quality over quantity for my dining bang.  Now...ask me about the Wynn buffet!",

We choose here because the  variety of choices sounded like it would be different, with the possibility of food we had not tried before. We were sadly mistaken. Mexican...same old same old, lacklusted salad options, dried up cheeses.  Chinese,  teriyaki chicken, rice and spring rolls, some dried up pasta and fish dish. Seriously, the only thing worth looking at were a few of the dessert options. Save your time and skip this. The Paris buffet is a much better choice, and surprisingly so was the Flamingo, which had fresh delicious food options in a bright and clean dining room.",

    "text": "Wow, that was bad even for a buffet.  I play poker and you get free entry if you play 3 hours of poker before 2 pm, so that's why I ate here despite the bad reviews.  Overall, here are some common themes: food wasn't warm/the right temperature, skimping on the more expensive ingredients, poor quality and labeling the dishes and sections wrong (ie the Asian food was labeled mid-eastern; the pancakes were labeled Mexican rice). Also, there isn't a big selection at all.  The tandoori chicken was undercooked and tough. The naan bread wasn't warm or doughy. The cheese quesadillas weren't warm and hardly had any cheese. The fried rice was dry and had some hard-ish grains of rice. The steak was tough and not flavorful.  The Mac n cheese was the worst Mac n cheese I've ever had. I don't know how they screwed up Mac m cheese but there were hard and dried out grated bits of cheese on top, the pasta didn't feel cooked enough, and the cheese was more like soup.  The deserts were actually all pretty good. I had a solid muffin, tasty fruit cobbler (although it's too rich and I was only able to have a few bites), and the vanilla custard was good enough that I wanted to go back and get some more.  But overall, this has to get one star. I kinda want to give them two stars, because it's only fair to lower your standards for buffet food, but this place... they went the opposite of above and beyond. It was notably bad, even for buffet food.  For what it's worth, here are some thoughts on buffet food in Vegas. I've notice that you really do get what you pay for. I've found that places $30 and above are usually pretty good, and under are usually pretty bad. If you want cheaper buffet food, head off The Strip if you can. It's usually almost half the price, and slightly better quality than the cheaper buffers on The Strip.",

We were surrounded by dirty tables as we showed up at 9pm.  The highlight here was the Mediterranean station. The lamb kebab and hummus were very good. Otherwise, the rest of the stations were underwhelming. There was very limited seafood during the weekday dinner (ie clams, mussels, cold shrimp and some fish). The dessert selection was better than Paris' selection.  I still do not know why we tipped our server when other tables did not.

    "text": "A disappointing option for breakfast at the Planet Hollywood hotel, the Spice Market Buffet is situated in the lower level of the hotel, accessed through an escalator on the casino level. The name definitely sounds more appetizing than the breakfast options there! I went in there with my family as a group of 8 on a Saturday at 8am. I wasn't sure we were lucky with no wait time because from arriving early... or because the buffet just doesn't attract enough customers!  There is basically no diversity in culture or types beyond the typical American diner options: sausage, scrambled eggs, and bacon. I felt like this place was a typical buffet made with a Denny's menu. Hash brown was a bit mushy, and the benedict was quite dry. A fifth of the food options are just various forms of bread, muffins, and more carbs! Pancakes and white porridge were nothing more than the ordinary. Everything felt pre-made because of the saran wrap covering most of the buffet items, giving an atmosphere that most items were heated from the oven without a thought on freshness.  Looking at the old Hollywood movie posters that dot the wall is quite frankly more exhilarating than eating breakfast here! For similar prices for one entree, definitely walk over to Cafe Hollywood not only for better breakfast, but also for better appreciation of the Hollywood culture thru throwback pictures! Grab your winnings and dine somewhere else for breakfast to kickstart your day.  Food: 2/5 Service: 3/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Environment: 2.5/5",

I wanted to build my own salad. There was romaine lettuce and nothing to put on it. There were tomatoes but they were part of a tomato salad and it had vinegar or some other topping. The chicken fajita was very salty. No Pizza, no sushi, no hamburgers. I've seen better buffets at Golden Corral and Home Town Buffet.   I wish we would have eaten at the Hollywood Cafe or Koi like the last two nights. It was so disappointing because we said we would only have a buffet once during our 4 day trip to Vegas. To say we were disappointed on this last dinner while in Vegas is an understatement.",

My husband and I were surprising my sister who was in Las Vegas for her birthday - and we drove in from Phoenix.  We were absolutely confident that it would be a great place us to have lunch.  Under the seafood section, there was no seafood, only two different types of pizza, a pile of ice cream cones and some sprinkles.  What the what?  It didn't seem like there was much to choose from, quite frankly.   The \"brunch\" had eggs that were not looking very fresh.  The Asian section had little that seemed appealing, the Mexican station had unseasoned chicken for fajitas.  Chips, but no melted cheese, only shredded.   I will say that the grape leaves were pretty good in the Mediterranean section, as was the babaganoosh.    Basically, I felt like I had just visited a Vegas version of Old Country Buffet.  Step it up, PH, you're better than this.",

    "text": "Food so bad, it literally made me feel ashamed to be an American.   Sounds absurd right? No. Reality. I'm a local. I've been to almost all the buffets. In the past, there was a low end (Stations city locations), mid-range (Spice Market, Rio), and high-end (Bacchanal, etc).   There is now eating out of a dumpster, and high-end. They reduced costs of operation at Spice Market so much, that there's almost no food, and what is out there has been sitting there for many, many hours.   I hadn't been to Spice Market in about 4-5 years. It's about 1/2 the size it was then. When I visited in 2013, there were probably 10-13 different sections of food with a chef/cook at each station. When I went yesterday, there were four sections of food, and for the hour we sat there, we saw ZERO food get brought out, and ZERO cooking. I saw a glimpse of someone come out and pour more sweet and sour sauce from a .99c bottle. That is it, and no I'm not exaggerating. Full hour, no new food, no stirring of the food, nada.   Everything was overcooked. The \"indian\" chicken was so overcooked and dry that cutting through it was like cutting through wood. The chicken crumbled like sand. You couldn't make it through a bite in 10 minutes. Imagine your most overcooked chicken meal at home, the one you more than likely threw away, make it x3 worse, and you're getting close to how awful it was.   I had one total plate of food, combining the 3-4 items that appeared remotely edible. I did not get through half a plate. I could not physically chew it, it was literally disgusting. Fried rice? They can't fail here, I thought. Even if it's been sitting for hours, it's gotta be fine sitting in all that grease right? Nope. The FRIED RICE was hard as a rock and room temperature. Chunks of it were like biting through plastic.   Ribs? Who can mess up ribs. Even if they look like they've been sitting for six hours. Nope, I couldn't even chew through the meat of RIBS it was so dry. I didn't even think that was possible. I've put ribs in the oven for hours before and they've been passable. How long must you cook ribs, and how long must you let them sit, for them to be that dry? Drenched in thick, thick dried BBQ sauce, cutting and chewing it felt like cutting through a very well done sirloin steak. If you've ever been to **** buffets, you know that ribs are one of the things that are nearly impossible for them to screw up. Even the worst Stations buffets, which come in at something like $10 a head, can't manage to mess them up (although they try).   The pizza I didn't even try, as it looked like a Digiorno would look like after 3 days left out on the counter.   I only came here because I got a free voucher, and that's exactly what you should pay at this place. As a local, I can tell you that the PH employee dining room is ***significantly*** better food. That's where they bulk-feed their employees every day. Hell, eating out of a dumpster would be preferable in certain situations.   It appears that all of the locals and most American tourists have savvied up to this though, as there were about a dozen people in the whole place, all of which were international. I saw person after person's look of disgust and disbelief as they walked up and down the small area of food looking for something to consume. Most failed.   A table of Chinese were there and quite literally only ate cantaloupe and other fruits, and then left. Of their party of six, none found a single dish they'd even try. I don't blame them. I wanted to assure them that Americans don't eat this sewer food either.   Caesars Entertainment needs to shut down this place immediately. Not to mention, my buddy (the only one bold enough to try the 1\" spring rolls) ended up on the toilet the rest of the night.   We each ate about a quarter of what was on our first plate and then left, hungry.   Embarrassing to Vegas. Embarrassing to Caesars. Embarrassing for the Strip. New name suggestion: The Sewer.   If you end up with a voucher to eat here for free, save yourself the time. Toss it. Stay the hell away. Kindly.",

She was very rude and seemed to be angry at the fact that she was bussing tables. Sorry that this is your job and your life is miserable, but don't take it out on the customers!   Other than that, my husband and I definitely got our money's worth. There is definitely better buffets out there than this one but this one was still pretty good and I walked out full and satisfied. I really enjoyed their mimosas and their variety of desserts as well as their Mexican food selection!

They didn't have much options, but at least they had fruit and salad. That's probably the only decent thing in there to eat, can't go wrong with fruit and salad right? Anywho, at least the employees were really nice and made sure to check on us for refills and taking our finished plates. But don't come here if you expect good food.",

The cedar salad had old brown lettuce in it but the cocktail shrimp was fresh. Dont expect anything fancy. Just good enough to pass. I dont think it was worth the price but then again everything in the hotels is overpriced. I  will say though that the service was great. Our server was on top of everything.",

Lucky me, I found a deal in travelzoo which made it almost buy one get one. Awesome! Be sure to check for any deals, I'm sure they always have something.   Atmosphere is like world buffet, they got almost everything. I feel like it's on a higher scale of hometown but the food is delicious especially the southern food. Everything tasted great for a buffet. We went to another buffet the night before which was triple the price of this place and it was terrible, the food here is way better!   The prime rib, pasta, salmon, everything tasted great. They also have unlimited alcoholic drinks for an extra 9-11$. Well worth it btw.  Oh! I can't forget about the service! The hostess as well as our server was impeccable!!! The best service I have ever had! Very attentive and kept bringing me drink refills without me having to ask!  The hostess was the sweetest person I have ever met! She was very helpful, and attentive. Her name was Joy. Yes, she was so great that I remembered her name even after one week.   I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas!",

Sadly, this was our destination.  When we first walked in we were asked to pose for a photo. You know, the ones they try to sell you half way into your meal. Oh well, we knew we weren't gonna get it, but we posed anyways and proceeded our way down to pay for the buffet. But, wth was taking so long? I swear it took us about a half an hour just to pay for our buffet meals. Excuse me, maybe you should have the people taking photos help you ring up customers into your buffet. We found out later that the place was short staff during that time.. I say it's poor management that can't cut employees from certain duties and place them in areas needed.  Once we finally got seated we ventured off our separate ways to get food. Out of the Asian, American, Italian, salads, and soups areas... All were terrible. I can't remember one food item that I went back to get seconds..  We left that buffet miserable AND my two friends and my stomachs weren't feeling the best either about a couple of hours later. Go to any other buffet on the strip but this one.",

It's not comparable to any other hotel buffets for that same price.   The quality of the food is just bleh. Everything from decor to presentation to taste is just very whatever. My usual favorite part of the buffet - dessert section just completely turned me down. C'mon..soft served ice cream??? (not even comparable to souplantations soft served). It's more like hometown buffet quality but hometown is 3 times less the price.   Ahh. Despite the desserts, other food was just not to my taste. It's True that there are a little bit of everything, from american to italian, asian, middleeastern, mexican, etc, but nothing was really that good. Probably the best thing that i had was a piece of prime rib that i got when we first sat down. When i went to get another piece later on, they already got a new chunk of meat, and that second piece was complete RAW, dripping blood.   I've been eager to try this place because i think this is one of the few buffets that i haven't tried in vegas and with pretty good reviews. Not a good decision. I will probably never go back again unless it's free.",

We ended up filling up on plates and plates of steamed snow crab legs and shrimp cocktails.  the steamed ones were so much better than the cold ones.  Then I had enough room for a sliver of prime rib and candied sweet potato.  YUM.  We finally finished off the meal with a taste of 4 different cupcakes and a fruit tart.  I could have lost control and eaten it ALL.  I agree that there were plates of things that just didn't make sense on why they were at a buffet (mashed potatos?  pasta?  corn muffins?) Why would you fill up on that nonsense?!  Their kabobs looked good, too but we just had no room in our bellies anymore.  It's worth it if you get the groupon deal and pay $45 for 2 people.",

It looks like maybe it would have been okay for lunch or dinner with all the different food around the world stations, but for breakfast it was just the same stuff and over again which would have been okay I guess if the food they had wouldn't have been so nasty.  The eggs were old and rubbery, the bacon was practically raw, the pancakes tasted like cardboard and the little mcmuffin type things had bread SO HARD I think I chipped a tooth. My friend got a danish and he hit it with a fork and it made a sound like a hockey puck. The quiche and crepes were no better.  We all ordered an array of drinks and the waitress managed to mess that up. Also, the hot chocolate was disgusting and the coffee wasn't much better. She was not very good and I got a rude vibe from her.   $20 per person seemed WAY over priced for what they offered. I will NEVER go here again for breakfast, and honestly, I think I'd skip it for anything else as well and go somewhere else like The Rio which I know to be amazing.",

Well, almost right because I hadn't been preparing all day for a buffet...  (Ironically, the seater then made us walk, uncle and all, all the way to the back corner of the place.)  Decent amount of variety, although a lot of it wasn't premium buffet stuff. King crab and prime rib were obviously the best picks overall, but I liked a lot of the other dishes, including the 4th of July special pulled beef with baked beans, the lamb kebobs and baba ghanouj, the fried shrimp (overly battered but still good), the italian sausage... mmm. Desserts were good too, especially the creme brulee and apple pie for me. Also, that frozen custard just somehow tastes different from the usual frozen yogurt...  Overall, it was a great meal, but not quite an unforgettable variety of victuals.  P.S. A foursquare check-in at the proper Planet Hollywood Resort can get you $5 off for this buffet.",

The chicken curry wasn't as good as I remember when this property was the Aladdin.  (Yes, it's been that long for me.)  The lamb-stuffed tomato offered was also laughable.  It's was just some ground lamb stuck on top of half a tomato.  No one bothered to actually hollow out the tomato and stuff it with anything.  The Mexican station was pretty good.  They had good guacamole.  This buffet also offers real glass ramekins, which are a nice touch.  The rest of the buffets just had disposable plastic cups.  The thin crust pizza was pretty good.  And the condiments were in appropriate locations, which I appreciate.  No hunting around for butter or soy sauce.  But a lot of things were mislabeled - another one of my buffet pet peeves.  Tomato sauce was labeled as curry sauce.  I poured some on my curry chicken, thinking I could get some extra curry sauce.  But no, it was tomato sauce.  Yuck.  I had to start all over to try the curry chicken.  One nice feature in this buffet is the huge restroom.  It's actually clean and quite nice.  Lots of stalls.  Pretty good buffet, but the Indian food offerings have taken a turn for the worst.",

I asked for their 24 hour AYCE buffet pass. It went up $20 to $70. Really? I expected the quality of food to have increased as much as the prices. Over half of the food I got was so SALTY, I couldn't eat it. If you have heart disease or diabetes, run for the exit. Ridiculously salty. It was 6:30pm on Friday when we walked in. This place was empty. Should've recognized this red flag.   Came back for breakfast the next day. Same thing. My favorite corned beef hash to the hash browns were saturated with salt. Who runs the kitchen now? They should rename their buffet \"Salt Market Buffet.\"  Time to find me a new buffet in town...Any recommendations?",

    "text": "Seeing as I gave the sneak preview in my PH review here is the more detailed version.  Spice Market to me is the most interesting concept buffet I've seen. Being a foodie with access to some of the best buffet's outside of Vegas I hold the restaurant  type in high regard. There is quality and quantity and good amounts of both reside here. You can really only eat American or non ethnic foods for so long before getting absolutely bored and living, working and growing up in highly diverse communities I found a passion for flavors of the world. This is something that Vegas has failed to understand with the standard buffets at other casino's. Sure they have everything you'd expect from sausage, prime rib, crab legs, shrimp, pasta, burgers, etc, but they also have KBBQ, cous cous, vegetarian dishes besides vegetables, kabobs, spring rolls, pad thai, carne asada, lamb gyro. The deserts could be better, but honestly I think they just need to be more hip. Offer some cake pop's, some bread pudding and not just brownies and sundae's and chocolate fountains. The desert game is uncharted territory for them and usually only the big boys can really diversify into that level. Service is excellent and the price is marginally higher than comparable standard buffets at other casino's.  It basically is a multi ethnic food court stacked on top of a Vegas buffet. Lets face it the demographics speak for themselves in the people who come here and the people who live there and work there. Expose yourself to some culture, come eat here. It will remind you more of home when you've been in Vegas too long.  The bad thing is that I eat buffets pretty often so stuffing my face while out here is a flaw I've fixed. I've explored off the strip and found some gems, but if taking a 10 minute taxi isn't your thing and you want to stay within your casino/hotel this is a fine establishment.",

Came back here this past sunday and give it another try since it's now Planet Hollywood. $23 pp for brunch (champagne not included, you'll have to add $3 for unlimited champagne).  The food is okay - just very typical buffet food. nothing that was amazing. You'll find mid-eastern, asian, mexican, american and italian  cuisines.   there was no line when we got there since it was 1130am so that was a plus. I wouldnt mind coming back to this place but it's definitely not my first choice.   The atmosphere / ambiance is alright. It's comfortable. the servers are  quick and friendly.",

    "text": "Spice Market Buffet. You are fuckin delicious.  Located at one of the Strip's most fabulous, in-demand, and decadently gay hotel & casino, you definitely know how to spice up one's dinner !! For the price, you're like a cheap slut that gives good head !! $30 per person for dinner !! If you have a Total Rewards Members card, you save a few extra bucks. More bang for your buck !! No pun intend...nvm  If you're on the search for this buffet, it's located (not conveniently though since you have to park at the parking structure in the back off of Harmon Street and walk through the shops) in the center of all the action of the casino. There are escalators leading you down to this wonderful eatery.  The line can get long during dinner. We had to wait awhile since everyone & their mothers invaded this place. You 1st pay in line and then you wait for a hostess to seat you. The process can be painful especially when you're hella hungry. Like come on people, get your fatty on and then leave once you're done !! Don't sit and talk !! Or I'ma have to come over & slap you hoe !!  The food is SOOOO GOOD here !! They have various foods from various regions of the world such as Asian, Italian, Mexican, American etc. Whatever floats your boat !! I personally like to attack the seafood 1st...leave no mercy. HAHA I know i probably look like a typical Asian buffet person (you know...the ones that stack plates & plates of seafood and not care bout the ppl behind them) but really.... I AM !! hahahaha feeding to my stereotype. To each their own bitch !!  The quality of the food here is superb !! You won't swallow anything nasty or stale or gross !! Their Italian section is amazing !! Especially the seafood pastas !! Yummm !! Are you drooling yet?  The seafood itself is unbelievable !! For the price that you're paying, you're getting incredible quality of seafood !! King crab legs get restocked over & over & over again !! Mine mine mine !! The Asian section is aiiiiiighhttt. Nothing to drool over. The Mexican section...I have yet to experience since I get too full before I even hit the right side of the buffet. Wahhh  THE DESSERTS !! AHHH there's cotton candy !! That itself is the deal winner for me !! How often do you eat cotton candy !! ....unless you're a Disneyland whore & practically whoring your body to Mickey Mouse for some sugar high. but really...that was the most exciting part about this buffet when I 1st saw the cotton candy !!  Anyways, coming down from my Yelp sugar high...the service is good here !! The waiters clean up your table often so it doesn't look like a barbaric feast. They're also really nice and patient !! Our waitress didn't rush us to finish since they were about to close out for the night so that was really considerate of her !!  So come here to get fat !! Just don't go to the club after. You'll be bloated off your ass & look nasty in that tight dress or dress shirt !!",

I thought it was weird that no one else knew about it, we only found out because we saw another table drinking that.  Aside from the prime rib, and my friend who fell in love with the tempura shrimp which he swears was coated in fritos + bread pudding + creme brulee, there wasn't enough offered at this place that would make me want to go back, ever! Apparently, this seemed like the same buffet when Aladdin was around, and I guess my experience between the two times has changed dramatically. They have an Asian section, Italian, seafood, salad, dessert (pretty good selection), American, Middle Eastern and Mexican section.  Blah, I'm getting irritated just thinking about it. I guess this means I'll have to make another trip out to Vegas soon and make my tummy happy then!",

So yes, for that alone, I'll happily admit I'm being too generous with the rating.  The Spice Market is a very bizarre name for this buffet. However bizarre name is the least of this place's gripes.  After that VERY long stair trip down (WTF?!), you get to the atrociously handled lineups. When you finally get through to the desk, yore asked if youre a rewards member or some crap. Aright. I'm seated at a table. terrible service, I asked the (very grumpy) waitress for a second glass of coke, and I didn't get it. I tried even getting her attention and she ignored me completely. NO TIP FOR YOU! (said in Italian accent)  The food is subpar, really. I don't see how this has the reputation of being the best buffet in Vegas. Obviously Las Vegans have low standards, but that's alright I guess. The gravy from the pot roast was caked on, why? The lamb skewers were overly elasticy. Wasn't a fan of the fried shrimp either.  But... THAT DESERT!!!! so yummy. I loved the cotton candy! The hand made tarts and what not... Yum! And the custard with strawberry sauce!!!! I'm a sucker for a good dessert, and this was it.  So it wasn't entirely terrible. But I wouldn't recommend it wither. I'll admit I only went because I was going to see Peepshow later, and had it not been for that, I'd have walked an extra few minutes to Aria instead.",

    "text": "when you're in vegas all you want to do is eat. there's so many eateries that its hard to choose from. buffets are what you think about next to drinking and getting drunk when you're in vegas. i on the other hand can only think about food so i was trying to figure out which buffets to eat at.   After asking a few locals their top picks for good buffets are at planet hollywood & at the rio. I've been to spices before & remembered that it was one of the best buffets I've had in vegas as well. So, the bf & I came for sunday brunch [for his first time]. He agreed that it was one of the best buffets that he has had in vegas as well.   Under the seafood section The buffalo fried shrimp was delicious! I kept going back for more. it had a slight kick but just the right amount. they had shrimp cocktail as well but you'll get your hands dirty with all the lemon squeezing. with the buffalo fried shrimp i munched on it as i walked to my next selection. it was a great balance because i got to clear my plate and add more while walking it off!   Under american section They have egg benedict as well traditional & one with apple glaze. As I waited patiently for the traditional which ended up tasting like the one with apple glaze because it had a sweet flavor to it. we didn't enjoy it one bit. they ran out of egg benedict and while waiting the guy in the back asked the meat carver to refill the egg benedict so i think without knowing which was what he placed the apple glazed flavor on the regular traditional.  Under the italian section is the mini waffles, pancakes, pizza, etc. im not quite sure why it is under the italian section but it was.   Under mexican section the carne asada fajita was bomb! the chicken fajita was too dry.   There's a salad & dessert section too. I didn't get any dessert because I didn't see anything cheesecake related & I wanted to save my belly for jean philippe patisserie. they had ice cream, crepes, etc.  service was fair. you can't expect too much at a buffet. while in line they will hand you a sheet of paper so that you can mark off which drinks you want and you can place it on the table while you grab food. so that's definitely convenient and efficient.    they also have tv's where you can watch sports. another bonus is they have their very own close by restroom!",

Now that Harrah's bought the hotel, and they take Total Rewards points, we finally came back and I was certain that the Planet Hollywood change would have changed the buffet completely, but it is actually just as good as I remember.  It is very rare to find king crab in buffets (except maybe wynn, bellagio), but they are still serving them, which was nice.  The pizza is also some of the best buffet pizza we have had.  I think I might have liked this place almost as much as the M buffet.    If you have to pick one buffet in town on the strip, and can't make it to the M resort, this is a great alternative.",

However, when she got back to the table, she had the diet and regular sodas all mixed up.  The buffet area is set up according different food \"cultures\": Japanese, Mexican, American, Middle Eastern, etc. Some of the food looked absolutely horrifying. My dad saw them mixing in snow crab legs with the king crab legs. Lots of stuff looked like it had been sitting out for awhile...  I found the only edible food in the Middle Eastern portion of the buffet. It had some couscous and fresh tomatoes sliced in half and topped with some sort of veggie concoction. It also had tandoori chicken and some really good vegetables.  I would avoid most of the meat here. Did not look appetizing at all...   They did have made-to-order crepes at the dessert station; I had a bananas foster crepe and it was pretty good.  Would I pay $30 to eat here again? Heck no. Especially if you can't eat much. If you're going to try this place out anyway, check around for coupons -- we found $5 off coupons available online.",

Carnival World Buffet @ Rio 4. Spice Market Buffet @ Planet Hollywood  Our last stop before heading out of Vegas.  We felt like we hit rock bottom after having experienced the Emperor's Buffet.  And it was a definite improvement to revisit a sure-thing at Rio.  The buffet at PH seemed much cleaner and more modern than the rest, so our anticipation was higher.  We were promptly seated, and there were even TVs that showed the game.  And they even had real cloth table napkins!  The selection wasn't amazing, but the quality was a half-step up from Rio, and a whole flight of stairs above Imperial Palace.  And yes, I referred to the buffets by their hotel name.  My friend really liked the chicken soup.  Ok, she loved it.  But I suspect she \"loved\" it cause she was hungover, and the ambience was such an upgrade from Imperial Palace.  I had to glance at the photos I took to jog my memory, and I got a dessert plate with 4 things.  It looked good, and I remember finishing the plate (instead of leaving it half-eaten like the dessert at Paris).  The next pic was of us standing at the exit giving a thumbs up.  Good way to round out the weekend.  I'd go back... if I had the 24-hr pass.  Again, not good enough to warrant a trek over and at that price.  Oh, and, again, I'd have given this place 3.5 stars if I could, but... well, see my review on Le Village Buffet.",

Out of all of the buffets we've been to (Paris, Planet Hollywood, & Caesars Palace) this is my favorite. Their wide variety of food suits every appetite I had. What I also liked about this buffet is that it's quite roomy, not cramped and crowded like my other buffets. Their crab is fresh and pre-cut so you don't have to struggle and crack anything. I am a little biased because I love tempura, and this is the only buffet (out of the 3) that actually had shrimp tempura.  Overall the food is great, however I only gave them 4 stars because their refills for drinks can be a little more quicker. Otherwise this buffet is great!",

For $25 I got to get some pretty amazing pile of Alaskan Crab legs and a seat next to none other then Steven Jackson of the St. Louis Rams who was probably in vegas for the Superbowl.  After my friends and I re-hinged our jaws, we basically filled up on crab legs and dessert to get our moneys worth.  Very little red meat or carbs were eaten so I can't comment on that but the crabs were just about as good as a $25 buffet can be.  In actually this place deserves about 4 for the food and 1 star for the celeb spotting.  Obviously thats biased, but hey, what review isn't.

The price isn't even what got me riled up, I've paid $30+ for buffets in the past and they have been well worth it. I don't even know what we paid for this one, but it was way too much. As someone else said there was an extreme lack of vegetarian items, and sadly the Mexican station was closed (dinner on a Thursday). The meats were not good quality (according to the bf), the mixed veggies were ridiculously salty, and oh thats about all we ate.   We didn't go to any other buffets so I can't compare, but if you're looking for one, don't do this one until they cut the price by at least half.",

The desert section had just different kind of cupcakes, one cheesecake that was really not very good and that was it. Not even ice cream was available.

    "text": "Overall, I was left unimpressed by this buffet.   The good:   They had scored snow crab legs so you could just slide the legs off the meat. The dessert section had a ton of selections, although I couldn't get a fruit tart because I didn't want to contort myself under the glass overhang to reach the tarts all the way at the back of the counter. The prime rib was good. The spring rolls in the Asian section were delicious.  I also liked that the buffet was separated from the main casino. You go down an escalator to a lower level, so you don't have to smell the smoke that seems to permeate all Vegas casinos.  The not-so-good:   Their salad section is really sad. On one side, I saw heads of iceberg lettuce chopped into quarters. That was literally all they had for salad. I found another salad section on the other side and got excited before seeing that the salad toppings were extremely limited. All they had was cheese, mushrooms, and croutons. No peas, no chopped ham, no bacon bits, no chopped eggs, nothing. I can make a better salad at Golden Corral.   There were really only five options in each section. No spaghetti in the Italian section, and the lasagna had one layer of noodle on the bottom, a chunk of ground beef in the middle, and another layer of noodle on top with some marinara sauce. I was disappointed.   I am not a picky eater and we went to this buffet with kids, so I wasn't expecting gourmet food. I think the horrible salad section and the lack of decent Italian food was just too much for me.",

There a lot of variety for most people, but as someone who's vegetarian and also doesn't eat pasta, the options were a bit more limited. Honestly, there was still plenty / tons of stuff to eat. I know I left the place over-stuffed.  We had bought a voucher for this place from one of those discount show ticket booths. They said lunch would be $14.99 instead of some other higher price and the voucher itself costed $2 each. One thing that was annoying was when we did go for lunch they said it was holiday pricing due to the Memorial Day weekend, and we had to pay like an extra $7 or so per person. We had already waited in like for like 15-20 minutes, so were like, what the hey.  The best section of the buffet was the Mediterranean food. By far. Not even close. All the entrees were really delicious. That happened to be my first stop and it definitely set the bar really high for the rest of the stations. Unfortunately, none of the others panned out in the same way. Nonetheless, even trying all the options got me stuffed.  It was so funny, the group I was with was super excited and hungry when we got there. They're all like, we're going to chill and fulfill for the next 2 hours. It was funny, that only like 30 minutes in, we were all more than done. That's how these places operate, I guess. Just like tables, you can't win against Vegas...",

We came here during Christmas week for vacation and had our eyes set on Buffet of Buffets. We waited in line for an hour and it was finally our turn at the register. Turns out B.O.B. prices were increased by $20 for the holidays, but whatever right? I had a Total Rewards card to get the member discount and figured it'd work for the total bill (just as it had for all the other places I'd been to) but the lady at the register insisted that all adults needed it. So fine, we go upstairs and get them and come back. AND THEN, we give her our gift card that a family friend gifted us, and she claims it doesn't work. Wtf bro (no one else had problems with it throughout our entire trip). So we decide to just settle and pay for just this meal. $200ish for 6 people. We get in line to be seated.  Once we are seated, we went to get food. I walk around twice, ending up with a slice of Prime rib and some mashed potatoes. There's nothing good here. The crab legs were dry and grimy looking, all other seafood included popcorn/bbq shrimp and baked sole. The only other things that looked edible were the grilled skewers in the Middle Eastern section. The dessert is whack. Cupcakes and cotton candy?   I get it, even if buffets suck in Vegas, there will still be loads of people, but c'mon guys, be reasonable!",

But over the past year or two(maybe even longer) its overall operation seems scaled back in quality and uniqueness of selections compared to its past and to the nearby strip buffets. In my latest visit the prime rib had a good taste but was fatty and unevenly cooked. A second cut was tough and overcooked. A third cut was just okay. Salad area still had a decent selection. Seafood selection was poor. Desserts were visually appealing but desserts (and breads) are a low priority for me at buffets. The staff kept the floor and counters clean except for the salad area. Table service was good considering how busy it was. It's sometimes very noisy here and even seems rowdy when the place is crowded at peak times. I'll probably return here again for dinner - but not on a regular basis.",

Even in that case I feel like i got mildly swindled.   Nothing really stands out in my mind as being good food.  Lots of things were obviously frozen or prepackaged.  The crepe with cherry pie filling was a brutal disappointment.    I did like the Baba Ganooj and naan.  This place used to be the Aladdin.  Stick with what you know.    Dry sliders, dry meat, turds in the shrimp, chewy tempura,  just disappointment after disappointment.  But it's a buffet.  Try it hate it and move on.   Why two stars.

I minus one star for the lack of selection, minus one for the taste of the food they did have, and minus another for not having any crab legs... Everything they had tasted like something made at a normal buffet like Golden Corral or Hometown Buffet; I'd expect better from a Vegas buffet. Sorely disappointed.  Customer service: 2/5 I only give them some stars because when I asked a random person for some ketchup, she brought it to me (though it took longer than one would expect). On top of that, we received our drinks from our waitress and saw her maybe once more for the rest of our 2 hour meal.   Ambiance: 2/5 It just feels like a place that will disappoint. You have to take the escalator downstairs to the dungeon. Inside it's somewhat dimly lit, but not like a nice steak house dimly lit... It just looks terrible and it's laid out so you can only walk along the food area to get from one side to another. This may at first make sense because they want you to see the food, but when you're getting food from across the place and it would be slightly easier to cut through, let them. Don't put up a wall half way through the place so you have to go all the way back around by all the food again.",

I don't know about most people but as for me when I go to a restaurant with my family and friends J want to sit together!!! They gave us a 2 round tables put together that would probably sit 9 to 10 people when I let them know that the space was to close for us to eat and if we could get a straight table put together her facial expression was epic! I wished I would of taken video of her rolling her eyes we get moved to a table where we could all get together we are all getting our food after I get my food I'm about to eat my dish right as I'm about to sit down the waitress comes and tells me at THEY made a mistake and J would have to resolve it before I could eat my food I let her know that J would go and resolve it after I finished my meal since we had been walking all day on the strip she started to make a big deal to the point I just sat down and tried to enjoy my food. I saw and heard our waitress talk bad about me and my party to other employee picking up the dirty dishes from the table next to us and also to the customers sitting in the table behind where I was sitting I turned around and saw her talk to them about why she was the way with us and after she realized that I was looking at her and listening she turn red as a patato and walked away. The way she acted was uncalled for and I can let you know that I probably won't come back to this place solely because of her actions sorry to say that because the food was great!!!  Message to the manager check your employees mouths, attitude and you won't get disgruntled customers as often!",

One person in our party got very sick after eating here, and he was adamant that it was something he had here. :(  Let me start with the salad bar. It looked like the Tasmanian Devil had run through. There were literally pieces of green leafy veggies strewn about, and nothing was cleaned up or refilled the entire time. This was disappointing as I really wanted some simple veggies to go along with my meal, and couldn't get them.  I remember trying some ribs which were awful along with some sort of rice dish from the American section was totally inedible. Pizza was awful.  The ONLY thing that was any good was the lamb kabob, which was surprising. It was the only thing I could find that was palatable, which is also the only reason it got two stars.

After purchasing the buffet of buffets 24hr pass my friends and I decided to give the Spice Market a try. We came in at around 10:30AM, so we were lucky to have both breakfast and lunch entrees.   The decor is simplistic, perhaps a bit too simplistic, especially for a popular hotel that is on the strip. The staff was adequate and the wait times weren't too long.  The food was average at best. There weren't any distinctive entrees. I expected some nice sandwiches, soups, salads, and breakfast specialties. Unfortunately there were no sandwiches but there was an adequate carving station that offered some decent prime rib.   Overall the Spice Market Buffet is a bit of a let down, but considering the list of buffets to choose from the buffet of buffets, the Spice Market isn't that bad of a choice. But if you decide to pay full price for the Spice Market then I'd advise you to go somewhere else, especially since there's so many great buffet options in Vegas. To good eatings.",

Walking around the buffet, NOTHING looked appetizing except for the snow crab legs. It turned out to be a disappointment because it was nothing but dry and flavorless.   Worst part was when my dad found a huge black fuzzball in his food. We all lost our appetites. At first we thought it was hair, but it turned out to be a thread that was pulled apart from a napkin.

We usually only go in the morning for Brunch as you can get both breakfast and lunch and who doesn't want a little of both?!  Some things, like most buffets, lack some flavor but for the most part everything tastes so good and is always presented fresh. I think people forget that these places can't over season everything as they are trying to cater to everyone's needs. Some like extra salt, some like their food with almost none so they do what they can. They are making mass amounts of food so expect some things to be under seasoned. You always add more at your table with the salt and pepper shaker. :)  My favorite thing to do is get they're Mac-N-Cheese and add bacon to it. Then I go grab some bread sticks from the side where they are serving the pizza. I then dip the break sticks into the mac-n-cheese sauce and it is delish! Is it carb over load? Duh....but who's counting on Vacation in Vegas?? Plus you need the bread to help soak up all the alcohol you are consuming while you're eating. You don't want to get too tipsy before the start of your day!  They're desert station is amazing as you can get cotton candy, strawberry shortcake, ice cream...you name it! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy a delicious brunch that gives you a little taste of places from all over the world. I don't think you will be disappointed.  I bumped the stars to 5 because they are prompt on filling up your glasses with the alcohol you paid for and that just makes a great start your day. ;P",

This buffet has a really small selection per style cuisine around 3 - 4 types of food per section.    The prime rib here was really juicy and red which I liked, but nothing else really stood out.   The meats (meatballs, lamb stuffed tomatoes, chicken, etc) were all dry and not very tasty.   For desserts they have 10 - 15 different types of cupcakes,  I had the Reeses peanut butter cupcake, Kahlua cupcake, Chocolate Ganache Cupcake, Cannoli cupcake, a fruit tart, and the cotton candy.   The Reese's peanut butter cupcake is good if you like peanut butter alot, but there wasn't enough chocolate for me.  The Kahlua cupcake barely had any Kahlua flavor.  The chocolate ganache on top of the cupcakes was really sweet and creamy.  The cannoli cupcake was pretty fluffy and moist.   The cotton candy was the only thing I really enjoyed at this buffet.  I didn't even eat that much because the food wasn't very good.    I would not recommend coming here if you have the buffet of buffets pass, because you will just be wasting your time.",

While some of the food was delicious (the prime rib was wonderful) other food was lack luster however the service provided by this guy, and his humor made up for anything negative. He even brought us premixed mimosas in the champagne bottle, less work for him and easier on us. He ever reminded us we didn't have to stick with champagne if we didn't want to. Well poor guy got a table that tried to pull a fast one, paid for one bottomless drink and tried to get him to serve them both bottomless drinks, then gave him grief when he explained the $13 was only for one person. We ended up giving him a generous tip when he realized what we gave him he came back and thanked us, and told us we made his day. No - he made ours and we showed our appreciation   We came back today and paid for the bottomless mimosas again and the ticket only showed get got a total Of 2. Our waitress Nina, who has been here for 16 years as she told me, brought me up to the front and straightened out the matter for us. Sadly the front desk ladies were not so friendly about the situation but eventually said ok. (Like they don't make enough money and my proof of payment wasn't enough right). To top it off I found out she is getting cut on hours and getting a job shift soon (busser and cocktail sever) which is sad to hear the company would do such a thing to such a long term employee, with great customer service as well.",

    "text": "Probably about a 3.5 star rating, but I just can't give it 4 because of how ill I was the next day.  Like, unreasonably ill.  I mean, it was my first night in Vegas that trip and I partied well beyond sunrise, so I can't totally blame it on the buffet, but I've never felt that ill and ditched out on the whole next night to stay in the hotel room and sleep.  I pride myself on being a trooper - and it just wasn't happening.  The food had to have *something* to do with it.  Anyhoo, we were trying to find dinner and finally settled here after getting the players club discount.  We were sat promptly, and got drinks right away, and they were refilled quickly (even though the boys drank about 12 ice teas each).  Highlights: the seafood was pretty good, the deserts were EXCELLENT, it was unique to have a whole middle eastern section (although it did lack some of the spice I would have liked, I realize I am at a buffet), the asian mixed veggies were delish, and the lobster pasta was YUM.  Everything else was adequate, but pretty much  forgettable.  The salad bar area was sort of disappointing, there wasn't much in the way of toppings.  All in all, I was perfectly happy with what I paid for what I got.  Although I wonder if the next day would have been different if we would have eaten elsewhere...",

    "text": "Back when the casino used to be the Aladdin, this was my favorite buffet in Vegas. My friends and I used to joke that the banners proclaiming it to be the #1 voted best buffet in Vegas could never live up to the hype. But we gave it a shot and it was awesome! Honestly, it was better than Bellagio's (meh), even Wynn's Seafood buffet (overhyped) at the time. The selection used to be pretty much all winners regardless of which section you chose.  I don't know what happened, but the last few times I've visited the Spice Market seeking the same satisfaction as my first visit, I've been let down. The quality has just fallen from where it used to be.  We went for the brunch: The eggs benedict was probably the best thing I had this time and it was very good, prime rib was alright (not juicy enough), and the fake Asian general chicken was not bad too. However, most of the other stuff was pretty average. Next time, I'll probably go somewhere else.  3.5 stars, but really some of that is the nostalgia factor. Dear Planet Hollywood Casino: You did a facelift to transform Aladdin into PH, might as well do the same with the Spice Market Buffet. The current iteration is only a shell of its former self.",

    "text": "Definitely will not be coming back here ever again!!!  The type of people that come here make the buffet worse than it is!  When in line to pay, this rude black lady was talking to me like I didn't speak english. I may be asian, but I definitely know how to speak english. She told us \"there is another cashier on the other side\" but there were so many people squished together, we did not want to squish through and be squished while paying! So I let her know that we know we have the option, but we would rather not push through the people. I told her that just because we pay sooner and squish, does not mean we will get seated faster because there was already a line backed up for the people waiting to be seated. It was so backed up that the cashier wasn't even calling for us to come over! She was waiting for the hostess to seat people so everyone could be comfortably walking around! Then I hear that the old ass grandpa wanted to cuss me out because of what I said. I was not even rude...I was just letting the lady know. I'm sorry but I think that a 65 year old man cussing out a 19 year old girl is just ridiculous. Completely classless!!  Then after we sat down, the seats were dirty with food all over! We had to ask our waiter to clean it off, and all he did was get a towel and brush the food to the floor.   When we got our food, mannnn. I wish we hadn't have paid. There was barely any food. I grabbed things that looked good, but after they entered my mouth, they didn't enter again.  Basically ended up eating 3 pieces of food and then went straight for the cotton candy because I was done for the night.  Another family sat next to us...while walking to their table, you could totally tell the son was drunk. After awhile, we definitely watched him throw up on the table then leave.   Needless to say, disgusting. Never again. They do not attract the right people.",

Even though people say dessert is best at Casear's Lago and seafood is best at Rio, I think Spice Market beats them all. Even a few of the workers at Casear's told me that Spice Market is best. When were first go here, we had to walk in the back corner at the Seafood station for warm crab legs. Sadly the warm butter didn't taste that great... it didn't taste like butter at all. I also liked the tempura shrimp, some pieces had too thick batter. The roast sirloin was good, lamb kabobs were okay, some pieces were dry. The Middle Eastern section was a few people's favorite in my party. I honestly don't remember what I ate here other than warm crab legs, roast beef, sirloin and fruits.   The desserts here are awesome though. Everyone liked the cotton candy and a they don't even care if you take it out. This place definitely has the best creme brulee. It was warm and the sugar cracked seamlessly. The banana creme pie was good, and cream puffs were delicious. I also wanted the ice cream but I was just too stuff.",

Have you ever eaten at a really good college cafeteria?  It's like that.  Crab legs, shrimp, oysters.  Yawn. Chinese food that looked like it had been sitting for hours. Some prime rib (probably the best thing there), pork loin, roast turkey (dry). I didn't even bother with the Italian section.  Besides the salad bar, that's all there was.  Exotic?  Not even close.  No Mexican, no Mediterranean, etc.  Desserts were many in selection, but just average in taste.  At $29.99 a head, you put out M&Ms and jelly beans as dessert selections?  Come on.  I would say this was only slightly better than the buffet at the Golden Nugget which I sampled the week before.  And I don't see them touting their Zagat review.  Speaking of which, there is NO way that this place rates 23 for food.  Perhaps the Zagat reviewer was down a few thousand bucks in the casino and was \"convinced\" to write a glowing review.",

Well, a man near by our table suddenly stopped breathing.  The paramedics came and let's just say the people who handled this were NOT thinking. They evacuated nearby tables (ours of course) without being relocated to anywhere else. We were just standing like dumb asses and we couldn't go back to our tables (which we had our valuables). How the heck were we supposed to eat standing up?! I've written a letter to their VP of food and beverage, Mr. Rick Holliday end of April. No response to date yet.   Oh yeah, the man was ok but we weren't so fortunate.  The food wasn't great and the experience made it that much worse. Note: this is the only place I have given 1 star",

But, with work colleagues it seemed like a good idea, but we went for the cheaper option of Planet Hollywood @ $15. I was ready for the Wynn, but I heard Bellagio is the best.  When I asked, \"what's the difference since the Aladdin changed to Planet Hollywood?\", the lady at the reception said, \"nothing, just the name. The food and everything is the same!\" So there you have it. If you came to Aladdin in the past, you've been to The Spice Market too.  Would I come here again. Probably not, but it was pretty competent. The variety is fair: Middle-eastern (kebabs, falafel, feta cheese salad), Asian (think Panda Express with some not-so-great sushi added), Italian (Sbarro-style), seafood (king crab, cod fillet, salmon) and desserts. Pho's desserts were the best thing I think. You still had to be choosy though...but the chocolate-covered strawberries and small tarts were good. As was the crepe with apricots.  Service was pretty attentive and our waiter looked after us just fine, even with the difficult things like \"water, no ice\" etc.",

I'm still a huge fan of Rio's buffet, which has a wider variety of foods and have more flavor. A lot of the food was very dry and the only items worthwhile was the cocktail shrimps and beef and cheese enchiladas.",

It was great - my favorite is still the Wynn, but at this price point, this one rocks.  We came in at the end of breakfast (which goes until 10:30), so we had the benefit of both breakfast and weekend brunch selections.  I'm surprised there were so many comments about the food being cold.  I found everything at the right temperature.  The fresh fruit crepes were okay, and I loved the waffles.  Nice selection of traditional breakfast items, an omelet station and fresh fruit for those who are trying to be healthy.  For the lunch/bruch portion, there was a nice mix of meats, middle eastern food like grilled meats and veggies, tabouleh, etc... to chinese, to italian (pizzas were fresh) to mexican.  There was a mix of quality - some of the fresh items like the smoked salmon were not the best quality, and the sushi was horrid.  However, the cooked dishes were good and they had a nice selection of desserts.  The quality and dessert selection at the Wynn is much better, but you're also paying a lot more.

Even though that did not stop us from eatting crab legs with our hand, I still pissed. I am a lady and would like to use my utensil in public.  There was a group of 8 people in front of us in line. So apparently, they will ask for  additional $20 to sit a party of 6 (either 6 or 8) or more together, please beware of this silly policy.

Cons - Expensive -Food is cold -Food doesnt look appealing",

My husband had gone to planet dailies and spent something crazy like $30  so after that everyone in our party went to the buffet. On the last day I joined them and I am glad I did.  It was about $20 and everything was very good. Huge selection and lots of options for vegetarians too.",

What better place to engage in gluttonous eating than a buffet? We arrived at the Spice Market right 10:55pm (they close at 11pm and for some reason we read that they close at 3am on Yelp. Glad to know someone fixed the times!) and they were nice enough to immediately seat us right in front of the desserts so we had quick access. They let us know that food will be put away by 11:30 and that we'd have to leave by 11:45. They gave us a list of drinks to choose from and we just checkmarked a whole bunch that sounded good so we could hurry along and fill up our plates. They separated the buffet areas by genres - Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Seafood, Asian, Dessert, Middle Eastern, etc. My favorite of everything that I tried was the crab stuffed sole. The crab is so flavorful and the sole was soft and delicate. Whether you're a dessert person or not, try the creme brulee. You will love it. And I love the fact that they had pink cotton candy. How fun and cute!   Our waitress, Remi (?), was an angel the entire time. She knew we were in a rush and was quick to bring out our drinks and give us recommendations on the best dishes. She felt bad when she had to kick us out at 11:45 and repeatedly apologized but we knew she was just following the rules. We came back the next day for round #2 but sadly didn't see her. Nonetheless, the food was one of the better ones we had from the Buffet of Buffets list and the service was exquisite.",

The food was pretty standard for a regular buffet, not one of the really high quality Vegas buffets.  I was a little disappointed.  The counters were dirty (not surprising since there were so many people there) and the food was a little scarce too.  An ok deal if you get the groupon and have the time to wait.",

After verifying who I was and my age multiple times, I was then seated at my table in a very isolated section of the restaurant next to where to what seemed to be the dish washing area/drink refilling station. I came alone, and this just made me feel even lonelier.  Afterwards I was greeted by a very polite server, who served me my drink. He was very courteous and welcoming, unfortunately I only saw him once......then briefly for a drink refill. After that, everyone was giving me a frown when asking for a refill. Now I was just feeling uncomfortable.  The food selection was spread out around the restaurant according to the country of origin. If I wanted American food, I was within easy access. If I wanted chicken noodle soup, I would have to make a trek across the restaurant with a very hot plate in hand, with a bunch of people running straight at me. The food is no different than that of a hometown buffet, at times I felt like I was at one of those international buffets for 6.99 that you go into knowing your stomach was going to have a party afterwards, but this is $32.00!!!!!! I only paid 7.00 thanks to my voucher but even then I felt I over paid because this place was horrible.",

We waited in along for a reasonable time (for Vegas), about an hour  in the early evening. However, after paying we waited a long time to be seated. There were only three employees seating customers and they were also also doing things at the register, helping with drink orders, and things like that. There were many open tables that were ready to go.   Finally seated, we went to the food and it was QUITE lackluster. It's divided by cuisine (Middle Eastern, American, seafood, etc) and many of the items just looked like it had been sitting for a while.  It was just very disappointing.   Funally desserts. We love desserts and a big portion of the desserts are cupcakes. Not everyone is a fan, and also no one wants to eat a full size cupcake. Buffets are about sampling lots of items. Crepe station seemed okay. Soft serve only, no real ice cream.   I think i would've been happier just eating at McD's. I hate McD's.",

The reason I'm giving this review a one star rating is due to the fact that this buffet wouldn't honor a comp buffet voucher for my girlfriend who came to Vegas for the first time and wanted to try here. As a new gold member for total rewards, she eagerly played the slots and excitedly earned a free buffet. The morning we went to here, we were hungry and ready to eat. We got denied the use of the voucher because the \"manager decided they weren't taking any coupons or vouchers\". Complete b s. They pulled this stunt on Christmas Eve. Here we are ready to eat and get turned away. The only advice we got from the staff there was, \"talk to the manager\". A lot of help that was to fight for our case. In the end I said loudly, \"let's get out of this garbage place and find somewhere better to eat\". We ended up eating at the much much better Cesar Palace's Bacchanal buffet anyways. They treat total rewards members right over there.",

The Mediterranean station had my favorite food. The hummus & curry chicken were delish!!! The tandoori chicken was a bit dry. The Mexican station was decent. You could make fajitas or nachos. The guacamole was questionable... You couldn't see any avocado pieces, maybe I just like it a bit chunky.  I personally really liked the Mac & cheese- so cheesey!!!!!! And the jalepeno cornbread! My tummy was happy.  Asian station was eh.  Dessert- I was super excited but was a bit disappointed. The cupcakes tasted like they had been out for a while, not hard but not as soft as I thought they would be. The crepes: I thought they would make them fresh but they were premade. You had your options of fillings and they were pretty good. One of the best parts of the meal.  Cotton candy was a fun little to go item you can eat on the way out.",

The eggs were so runny and cold yuck! every item was pretty bland, bacon was paper thin, every section just had the same selection of things. We would have rather paid our own money and have a nice breakfast somewhere else. I am not a buffet person and probably wont go back to one anytime soon. The bill would have been $45 dollars for fricken breakfast. Id like to know what idiots paying to go to these expensive Vegas buffets thinks paying over $25 for runny eggs is good value?",

A couple of skinny friends mentioned this place but I'd always brushed them off.  Who trusts skinny people when it comes to good buffets?  But it was the closest buffet to our hotel, so we went and holy moley was it the best decision a couple of hungover kids could have made.  I started out small with a salad since that's usually what my hangovers require of me.  Best salad I've ever had.  I can't be sure it was because it cured my hangover or the salad was, in fact, the best salad I've ever had.  But enough of the lettuce, EVERYTHING was good.  Even the indian food, which is fairly odd for a buffet.  But the meat and dessert did me in.  Pretty sure I lost 3 pounds being sick and gained another 6 from parking my piggie arse here for a good 2 hours.",

The food was bland, and had been sitting there a while (crab legs smelled extra fishy, turkey breast was extra dry and hard). On a positive note, the roasted carrots with raisins and almonds, and the flan were excellent and they had a good selection of cupcakes and dinner rolls. The cleanliness of the place was acceptable, and they had a restroom conveniently located so I could wash my hands from the crab leg juice. There is absolutely no cellphone signal (buffet located at ground level) and the hotel charges you $13.99 to use their wifi per 24hr period. Very unlilely for me to return.",

They have never run out and I was there for Brunch and dinner. Dinner is better because they also have crab legs. My wife took full advantage and probably had about 5 pounds of them. The melted butter for them cools fast, and becomes a gelatin, which wasn't too appealing, but unless you're eating them for over a half hour(I won't mention my wife again) that should be an issue. I like the food quality, and freshness. The cleanliness is great and a large factor in the 4 star rating as well. Service was hit and miss. While the servers were always prompt and attentive, some were not as friendly as others. Still, our drinks were always full, and our table always cleared of used dishes. Would go again for sure.",

Plus, they have fresh spun cotton candy.    The cost isn't too bad, and you can always get the rewards program and do this thing where you can eat at the buffet for as many times as you want within a day, which is pretty convenient cause you can eat 5 smaller meals instead of one giant meal which will make you feel like you're gonna kill yourself.  This way you can taste EVERYTHING!  And it ends up being cheaper to buy this and eat as much as you want rather than going to other random places to eat a meal.",

I don't know if I have (yet) been to a better buffet than the Spice Market Buffet, and now I worry that this will ruin all future buffets.  This is the kind of place that makes you sad that the stomach can only hold so much food....I wanted to eat everything!  Just as in any buffet in Las Vegas, you must traipse through a casino full of exploited  scantily clad women, and breathe copious amounts of second hand smoke - but the reward of the buffet is SO worth it!   The food was amazing, and the real standout to me was the middle eastern section.  I have never been to a buffet that has even HAD a middle eastern section - let alone one that is so delicious!  Another one of their specialties is cupcakes. Now, when you arrive - head directly for the middle eastern section for delicious, and freshly grilled skewer meat and vegetables.  Are you a crab legs fan?  All you can eat snow crab are ready for you to get your hands into!  Other highlights are the steamed BBQ pork bun (think dim-sum), curry chicken, handmade meatballs, pork street tacos (I added guacamole of course!), California Rolls, and the tomatoes stuffed with ground lamb!  Even the salads and fruits all tasted fresh.  Service was good, though the lady at the register kept pushing the \"club card\" for the hotel.  No thank you.  I wish there was more I could tell you, but to sum it up:  This was as good as it gets.  This is exactly what I think of, when I hear the term \"Vegas Buffet\".  You can bring anyone here, and they would be happy with at least SOMETHING here!  SUGGESTIONS:  Stop reading this review and GO EAT AT SPICE MARKET BUFFET!",

    "text": "For a casino buffet, this was a disappointment... it was the least nice of all of the buffets we visited in Vegas (and believe me, we visited a lot).   First of all, after having been at the beautiful buffet at the Wynn the night before, the atmosphere here was really lacking. I almost kind of felt like I was in someone's basement. It was somewhat cafeteria-y.   The service was terrible. I commend them for the nice idea of having a card on which you can make your drink selections, so you don't have to wait for your server to arrive before going up for food. But this seems to foster an attitude of complete disinterest for the servers. I think we may have interacted with our server once... or maybe not, not even sure if that was him. He seemed overworked and stressed out.   The food here really wasn't bad actually, but it's hard to completely appreciate it in light of other negatives. That being said, this may be one of the better buffets for vegetarians. I really enjoyed the middle-eastern and Mexican areas.   Overall, decent and sometimes quite good food is overshadowed by a lousy environment and absent service. Not bad if it weren't in Vegas, but for Vegas... disappointing.",

There is a large selection of food but everything I tasted seemed bland.  The dessert selection was huge; however, everything seemed to have some odd flavor added into it.  Every chocolate cake or cupcake I picked up had fruit or jelly in the center, when all I wanted was a simple dessert.  We could never find our server, and when she came to our table once or twice all she did was refill our water.  Another employee ended up clearing our plates.  Even with Total Rewards it came to $65 plus tip for two people which seemed absolutely ridiculous.  Would not visit again.",

Please remember to show your Total Rewards card since they do have a discount for cardholders.  I tried the dinner buffet here on a Saturday, the wait time was about 10 minutes, which was surprising, the food selection and variety here was outstanding in my opinion, they have about six or more sections of food (Seafood, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Asian, Italian, and American)  The middle eastern and american sections of food were the favorites for this trip.  The shrimp, lamb, crab legs, and dessert selections were very good as well.  There is also a prime rib and turkey carving station, the mashed potatoes were very good. The service was great, our server checked on us numerous times to fill drinks and remove our plates when we were finished.  I'm sure this varies depending on what time or day you visit, I've some to expect most buffets in Vegas can be hit or miss on service, etc so don't hold it against the employees since they are trying their best to keep up.  I will definitely have to try this buffet again on my next trip to Vegas.",

I did a walkthru first to see what they have to offer before i fill my plate up with food. They got a good variety of food which is nice. To buffet standards everything was okay except the sushi. That was whack. Rice was terrible and the spicy tuna was no bueno. It is a skip for sure. Save your stomach space for something else.   Since it was brunch there was also some breakfast food available. Didn't really take advantage of it but the bacon I had was good. Nothing wowed me. The prime rib was pretty good. Totally didn't get my money's worth in this last trip. I had one plate and a little bit of another. Just wasn't feeling it.",

    "text": "We decided to go here after our wedding at Planet Hollywood since we were getting married early in the morning and we did not want to try and get everyone back together later on in the afternoon.  The price was not bad (under 15 bucks for breakfast) and they had a great selection of food.  I even had a bunch of shrimp tempura with my breakfast...how cool is that?  The food would more than likely get a 4 in my book.  Our waitress was a delight...she had a great attitude and was able to take care of our whole group.    My one big complaint is about the group reservations...once we knew what time the wedding was (a couple weeks before) we started trying to contact people at the hotel to get a group reservation.   Both myself and my mother-in-law called person after person and number after number.  We were told people would be calling us back and that they would figure it out for us.  We seriously got a huge runaround trying to make a reservation...it was very frustrating.  We finally got somewhat of a reservation a couple days before but when we showed up in wedding dresses and suits with like 30 people it was a big huge production with them trying to figure out what to do with us.    Also to top it off we were told we had to be done by a certain time...like we had to be out of the buffet at a specific time.  Remember this was after our wedding and I am sorry if we wanted to hang out and talk and celebrate.  I think they gave us a hour and a half total before we had to leave for another group.  Not the best impression on an otherwise magical day.  :0)",

It was pretty good for taking the elevator down and have a choice of just about any kind of food you want. I don't think you can expect lobster and crab at 11:00am in the morning, but you will get some things like prime rib and other nice cuts of meat.   If you're not gambling then you're probably going to pay full price at like $25 or more. Coming from Chicago this is a pretty steep price. You're only in Vegas so much, so why not right? I would probably go back here again if I could eat twice as much or if I had a huge amount of comps. If you got money to blow, you're really hungry and don't want to go far from the hotel, then you can get away with eating here and being happy about it.",

Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, whose name is a small tribute to the days when the Aladdin sat in its place, is one such place.  While I was not overly impressed with their Asian or and poor seafood offerings -- though the sliced crab legs and crab rangoon were fine -- their Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern dishes (and reasonable pricing) make it worth a quick trip for lunch.  Here you can find a variety of meat kebabs, grilled veggie skewers, tomatoes stuffed with ground lamb, couscous, chicken tandoori, and a number of curry dishes that will manage to sit in your tummy just fine.  It's also a lot more kid friendly than most other Vegas buffets, and offers a cotton candy station, and a crepe-making station for dessert. Some might feel this is a fun touch, but I'd rather not see children stampeding through my debauched vacation or digging through the serving pans with their snotty fingers.",

Then you get either 25% off for lunch or 50% off for dinner. I went to the Dinner and only paid $17.49 before tax. Some highlights for the dinner, there are crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, short rib, and lamb from Mediterranean section. If you love Asian food, don't come here, because they don't have much variety and the food doesn't look delicious to me at all. Mexican section is pretty good. However, very limited choices for the salad bar and fruits. There are so many cupcakes at the desert section, if you love cupcakes, go for it! They also have cotton candy there which is cute! Anyways I think Spice Market meets my expectation very well, it is average buffet on the strip but price was good! I have had so many buffets at Vegas, the only memorable one is the Caesars Palace only because they have fresh oysters, but you are paying $32.99 for lunch and 40 sth for dinner! So people scale back your expectation for the spice market!",

I don't know who holds the title now but damn they must really have had to out do themselves to beat the SMB which still holds the crown in my opinion.  Unlike the buffet that I'm used to in L.A. (lets just say its in my \"Hometown\") SMB doesn't make you feel like they're herding cows and feeding you slop. The food here is top notch and great quality. You've got hundreds of choices to choose from and you're guaranteed to find something to make you say \"damn!\"  The prices vary from Breakfast ($15ish) to Dinner ($25ish) and can get a little on the $$$ range but there are deals you can take advantage of. I recommend 24 hour buffet of buffet pass and start with dinner. You can pretty much plan out 4 meals (which can include 2 dinners if you time it right) and come out on top. Join the Total Rewards program for even more savings.  Damn, I'm starting to sound like I work for this place! But really, take advantage, enjoy and good luck!",

    "text": "I have always heard about the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood and I finally got the chance to visit. It is located after about a half mile walk from self parking through the Miracle Mile Shops past the casino, so be ready for this. Once you get there, I went for dinner, the line is usually about an hour plus.  After getting a seat, you have to take a few seconds to see where to go for which food station you might want. There are always a lot of people eating here so decide if you want American or Mexican food for instance first. A plan will help you out.  I visited the American, Asian and Italian sections. Almost everything I had was sufficiently hot with the exception of a few. I expect that the food, once it is put out, is almost immediately consumed, so the food should be consistently hot. I enjoyed some of the premium food options over other buffets in Las Vegas. I would hope so as the price is in the upper range, near what some of Vegas' five star resorts charge for their dinner buffet. The best idea is to go for the wristband option from Caesar's Entertainment Corp. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.  I enjoyed the tempura shrimp too, quite crispy. The Spice Market Buffet is a good choice for those wanting a very large buffet and are close to Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "Been here several times for brunch. While I think the food is \"good/ok,\" the reason I gave it four stars is because of its large selection of foods from different parts of the world. There really is something for everyone. You can have breakfast food, Mexican food, Asian food, Indian food, salads, Italian, etc etc. Each \"type\" of food has its own section, so you don't end up with only one pasta dish and one Asian dish for the whole buffet. There is a decent amount of variety per food genre. I also remember the desserts to be quite good!",

The guy making omelettes could not have put less effort into asking customers if they wanted anything. The organization and placement of the foods was very confusing. Scrambled eggs were cold, saw a couple bugs crawling on donuts and the oatmeal was stuck to the ladle. I had some fruit and cheese. It was okay but frankly my mood was ruined from the other issues. The place looks dirty as well. Will not be back, even for a free meal.",

Even though I consider myself a lady, I couldn't stop looking at the laa-dies!!!  How else was I going to get to this buffet?  Buffet of Buffets got me and this was my final and last stop.  24 hours came and went in a flash!  It was only 2 hours ago that I had lunch but I only had 4 more hours before this 24 hour bracelet expires!    We waited in line for about 20 minutes, which is reasonable.  As we reach our cashier, I asked the guy to cut my branded bracelet off of me.  He asked me if I was sure... I actually hesitated for a second, thinking, I can get another buffet in!!!  As he cut the bracelet off, I felt a tinge of sadness...AHHHH!!!  No more buffets!  But a slight happiness too... AHHHH!!! No more buffets!  The deed was done...  Both of us being still full from our last buffet adventure, sat for a very long time before heading up to grab food.  And my round 1 attempt was pathetic...   Round 1: pesto pasta, fried chicken, mash potatoes, anti-pasta, various cheese slices and olives  Round 2: Alaskan crab legs and shrimp cocktails with fresh lemons  Round 3: Chips and salsa, tandori chicken, baklava, prime rib  Round 4: Alaskan crab legs (hey, don't judge, this stuff doesn't take up much tummy real estate :P)  I requested for hot tea at the end of the meal and it was Lipton, bleh.  But the wow factor came when they gave you a small jar of honey to go with your tea.    Although I came in already stuffed from another buffet, I can absolutely tell that the food was really good.  The selection was abundant and I think I would come back for more next time I come to Vegas.",

Pay a little bit extra and eat some world class food. I'm extremely disappointed. Will never come here again and I'll be sure to update my food blog to warn everyone.",

Crab legs, shrimp scampi and crime brulee were good. Else, I'm not sure... The foods offered did not look good- not fresh, boring and not a wide variety at all. Honestly didn't try most of it because it looked unappetizing. (So I didn't leave the buffet stuffed, actually was hungry 2 hours later!) Most of the food looked old although it was packed, but it seemed like most people ate crab legs, so I guess it makes sense that the rest of the food was untouched, aside from desserts (though also nothing to brag about). Have been to wicked spoon and they are WAY better!!!!!!!!",

Heard about the crepes and the freshly spun cotton candy so off we went to try.  Overall, the food offerings were pretty decent. Mid-easterm section was good, prime rib was tasty, seafood was pretty decent. I liked the half-shelled crab legs.   Dessert section was good with a lot to choose from. The crepes though good was only dessert, no savory crepes. They pre-make the crepe \"cakes\" before warming up and adding the sweet ingredients. The cotton candy brought us back to childhood. A nice treat that's different from other buffets in the tour.  Service was good, but our server was an older guy and seemed kinda annoyed at something. Didn't seem all that friendly but did get us our drinks quick.  *They do offer wine and spirits for an additional cost if have the Buffet of Buffets pass.  a solid 3.5 stars.",

This is extra bad coming from me- a person who is usually happy to eat whatever. The buffet is honestly worse than the Golden Corral- and that's really bad for a place that costs this much.

    "text": "Saving my 100th review for Vegas buffets....  I've been here several times, but my recent visit to Vegas during the summer we did the 24 hour buffet pass for $45. Without it, price for regular brunch is $27.99 and dinner $29.99, but for $15 more you can visit one of several different local buffets as many times as you'd like in a 24 hour period. Definitely a good deal and worth it.   The Spice Market buffet has one of the largest selections and the freshest food in town. I suggest you get here early (30min) to avoid the lunch and dinner rush. The buffet is set up in stations that represent different styles of cuisine. Great lineup of world foods that are sure to delight your taste buds and senses with offerings from the Middle East, Asian, Mexican, Japanese, and Italian. Plus your standard American buffet spread - prime ribs, ham, turkey, bbq beef ribs, roast chicken, etc. For seafood, the king crab legs, stuffed scallops, salmon and shrimp cocktails are delictable and tasty. The crabs come pre-cracked making it easy to pick through and cuts down on the time required to enjoy them. My favorite station is Middle Eastern grill station. Great grilled lamb, kabobs, and vegetables.  The dessert station is awesome here. Decadent choices of desserts like cream brulee, cotton candy, canoli, cup cakes, eclairs, fruit tarts and chocolate dipped strawberry. There is even a live cooking station for dessert where a chef will make you a hot bananas foster or a made-to-order crepe.  Atmosphere is nice and service was pretty decent. The server was friendly and would stop by regulary to re-fill our drinks. They have TV throughout the  restaurant perfect when watching the Lakers or sports game.  Overall - 3.5 star. I would recommend this place to anyone. Definitely a better choice over Harrahs or Paris buffet.  Cons - Finding the place can be difficult cause its located in lower level of the hotel. Make sure to follow the signs to escalator. Long lines during peak lunch and dinner hours. Pricey, but make sure to get 24hr pass for great deal.",

When I'm at Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, I'm faced with so many selections that it can be overwhelming. On my last visit, service was impeccable. Our server (Aman? Amman? Not sure) was super quick clearing the table and getting drink refills.  Honestly though if you've never been to a Vegas buffet, Bacchanal would be the place to go - not this.  Spice Market is where I go when: 1) we have a big group and everyone wants something different, 2) I'm already staying at Planet Hollywood, 3) I want to eat on the Strip without spending big bucks at those celebrity chefs' restaurants.  They have Groupon from time to time - breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner for two people with unlimited drinks. Obviously if you go for dinner you get the most bang for your buck since you pay the same amount for the Groupon.  Total Rewards members get $1 off the buffet price.   P.S if you want cotton candy you have to request it at the dessert station!",

    "text": "I like the assortment, here.  It is one of the few buffets in Vegas to offer Middle Eastern food.  I do not recommend the baklava, if you want authentic.  It is overly sweet.  It doesn't taste bad, but it wasn't what I was craving.    Some of the foods are hit or miss.  Some of the chicken dishes, for example, are extremely tender and flavorful, and some are dry and bland.  Luckily, they don't seem to charge extra even if I leave their tasteless food on the plate.    I got the shrimp tempera right as they put it out, and it was delicious.  I don't usually eat tempera when I go to restaurants because the oil is reused so much, it leaves a nasty taste, and it isn't a good crispy texture, but this one was crisp and delicious.  It was the best I've ever had, even compared to non-buffet restaurants.  It has some unique dishes as well.  They had ribs cooked with a black pepper sauce on the outside so that it was crispy on the outside.  It was interesting.  They also had meatballs with breadcrumbs around the outside creating a crispy exterior.  They also have a lot of the foods Le Village Buffet in Paris has.  For example, they have the same breads, but more.  They have the same cheeses.  They have the same meats, but more like the stuffed sole fillet.  And best of all they have the frozen custard.  The crepe station here just gets premade crepe skins and reheats it with butter.   Also, when I when, the cuts of meat on the carving station seemed better at Le Village, compared to Spice Market.  Overall, this and Rio are my favorites from the Buffet of Buffets.",

Usually their lamb kabobs are tender, however on this particular day, they were overcooked and dry. Prime rib on the other hand, was the most tender I've ever eaten, it basically falls apart in your mouth. Not normal at all o_o  Seafood crab legs and shrimp pale in comparison to Baccanal buffet and Rio carnival. The shrimp shells are still on and they don't de-vein them. Everything else was so-so and not impressive.",

Just like any other buffets, you walk up to the cashier to pay for the number of guests. Veronica was pleasant enough, which is totally understandable.  The price was $30.99 per person.  I didn't think it was to bad for a dinner buffet.  Decor was nothing to remember.... just a huge dining room with various cooking stations against the wall.  We were seated against the wall and then the server came over and told us about the buffet and took our beverage order.  My experience was very pleasant.  First, I had started with the appetizers/ salad area. I was a little disappointed with the shrimp.  It was very hard to get all of the shell off.  No matter what, I would be eating a piece of shell.    There were plenty of options to choose from.   Next trip was for the \"American\" entree's.  Everything from prime rib, ribs, chicken, turkey, mashed potatoes, etc was there.  Okay, I had gorged.  The food was very good.  The ribs were just right - falling off of the bones.  I didn't even dare to check out the desserts.  I would not have been a pretty sight if I did.  Overall, this was a great buffet and I would recommend it and would return.",

    "text": "Not sure why so many reviews are outraged and unnecessarily low-scoring: this place is about what you would expect for a Strip buffet that is not listed among the top best. This is not the Bellagio, this is not the Wynn, so scale back your expectations accordingly.  That being said, it is surprisingly large and when I went on a weekend for dinner just after 5PM, the wait was less than 5 minutes. Maybe some consider that a bad sign, but as we dined business picked up.  Came using a BOGO Groupon- all you can eat and all you can drink for two for $46. Not bad at all. Pricing was not available online to see what locals prices were or which deal was better, but gave it a shot. The $11.50 extra for all you can drink option is not something I'd pay to add on in the future- BF and I each had two drinks (beer and champagne, respectively) and did not feel it was worth it.  Food is divided up by cuisine style: Seafood- snow crab legs and shrimp plentiful, but disappointed with sushi. Very little was out and it was all dry and falling apart as if it was left over from lunch or the day before. Was never restocked during our visit. Only consisted of simple cucumber, salmon and california rolls. Avocado in the CA roll was brown, ew. You'd think with crab and shrimp available, there would be a better selection.  Salad- loved the wedge salads available, haven't seen that many places! Soups- only chicken noodle and tortilla were available, didn't look appetizing.  Italian- pastas all looked as if they'd been sitting out, but meatball was tasty. I'm mostly avoiding carbs, so I did not really spend much time in this area.  Chinese- very generic, did not have anything here.  Barbecue- BF enjoyed the prime rib, yukon gold mashed potatoes were delicious, barbecue pork shank was tasty! Despite signage for sliders, only fried chicken kept being put out. It was tasty but not my thing.  Dessert- Tons of cupcakes. Not sure why they're so large, seems wasteful as most people are only taking a bite or two and trying other flavors. Someone probably needs to rethink this.  Mid-Eastern- grilled veggies, chicken and lamb were all good, tabouli and naan flavorful, lamb tagine was surprisingly True to flavor.  Mexican- Like the Italian area, disappointing. All food was very basic and appeared to have been sitting out.  Salad- lots of cheeses, breads, and spreads available here. Opted for a lot of fresh fruit and got a wedge of brie with some fruity bread, very tasty.",

I would like to give this a higher rating but there is really nothing that stands out fromt heir offerings.  Cotton Candy and their Middle Eastern section is the only saving grace from another deduction.  Some say that there is quality. They may be eating from the floor then.   Sorry.",

The place is pretty big and tables are not too crowded.  Loved the breakfast section.  they also have meditterrean, seafood, asian, mexican, and roast beef/ham sections.  What also stood out was the cupcakes section.  they had about more than 10 flavors.  I was actually expecting a variety of desserts such as cakes.  I would not mind going back to this buffet.  I have been to Cosmo buffet which is so much better.  I have been Harrahs buffet which was a little better than this place.  This place is way better than the TI buffet.b",

We decided to try Spice Market Buffet for two reasons - the price range was decent and we'd never been to Planet Hollywood hotel before so at least we'd get to see something new.   Despite warnings about longer than long lines we got there and waited for about 10 minutes before paying and being seated. It wasn't fast but it wasn't terrible. Cost was $24.99 per person which was more than we would have liked but the variety of food that we were eyeing while in line made up for it.  Between the three of us we downed 7 plates filled with a range of food including breakfast (waffles with lovely ph logos on them!), sushi, prime rib, pizza, asian food, mediterranean food (dolmas were delicious), quesadillas, and seafood. We topped it off with some soft serve and cotton candy which ended the meal quite nicely. Plus, there were a ton of things we didn't even attempt like the crepes, lasagnas, soups, salads, etc. We were just too full already!   Overall, a perfect way to end a weekend getaway in Vegas. Lose some money but gain some weight. Fair trade no? :)",

Sadly, on that trip, we only went to the Bellagio's.  I fixed that on this trip out.  We went for a late lunch on Sunday and found that no matter what time you go to a buffet, they are always hoppin with business.  For about $27, you will be given countless options for food.  I had some of the steamed shrimp, a couple of things from the Asian station (surprised to see some dumplings there and even more surprised that they were pretty good), a couple of things from the carving station (BBQ beef was moist and not dried out, the prime rib had a wonderfully spiced edge), and a few things from the Middle Eastern station (some hummus, eggplant, and tabbouleh).  Everything I tried was good, and I was careful to grab only a spoonful.  Dessert was simple:  a helping of some damn good bread pudding with a shot of vanilla soft serve ice cream on top.  Niiiiice.  There's a lot of food choices here; bring a cot or sleeping bag if you can.",

In my humble opinion, this place is only popular because of the hotel and not for the food.  To reiterate, the food was either bland or salty. Thankfully, we had the Buffet of Buffets deal for $45.99 (after the $5 discount for being a total rewards member) and we got to eat at 6 different buffets within 24 hours. So for the price of it being Buffet of Buffets, it was only okay. If I had to pay for the original dinner price, I would be quite upset right now. Do not pay full price would be my best advice. It simply isn't worth the price!  About the food, only 3 things really made my trip a little better: -the fruits (lame right?) -the middle eastern food section as many have mentioned was good -the cotton candy (wow! this was the only buffet I know that offered cotton candy!)  Other than that, nothing else stood out. You're better off saving your money and spending a little more on more noteworthy buffets---like the Wynn and/or Belagio.",

Don't be fooled by my 4-star rating; the food isn't amazing -- but it gets the job done without breaking the bank. I've been here twice for breakfast and lunch, and everything tasted decently yummy.  My favorites from here are probably the French toast with real strawberries and syrup, most of the chicken dishes, and the soft serve ice cream (one of the best soft serves I've ever had). They also have a great dessert selection, including deliciously soft and chewy cookies and cotton candy. Yes, you read right, COTTON CANDY. I forget why but for some reason our buffet came with champagne and we discovered that putting cotton candy in champagne makes a fine (and sweeter) tasting bubbly.  No complaints from me!",

I like how all the sections are labeled in large letters \"seafood\", \"dessert\", \"italian\", etc. I love sweets so I tend to put a lot of weight on their quality of desserts. Here, it was a hit or miss with the items. Their ice cream custard was good, esp with chantilly cream, which was excellent quality. They make cotton candy, which was something new so that was pretty cool too. Their fruit tarts were excellent. However, their flan was too stiff on the outside and was more like jello, as was their banana cream pie. The cream was like a stiff block of jello that had been sitting outside for a few hours and allowed to dry....also, their crepes were too thick for my liking. It seemed more like a pancake.   Now their Mediterranean section was delicious, and their salad bar delicious as well. Their asian section was ok, some of it was good and some was just bland. Their pasta was excellent as well.  Seafood wise, the selection seemed ok.  I would come here again if someone suggests it, but my first choice would still be Wynn.",

The options here are plentiful, but the drink service was super slow and we were seated in an area and they were cleaning around us during our meal with a janitor cart. It kind of spoiled the mood. They had sports on TV, which as an Olympic fan, I enjoyed.  Some of the strengths here are the middle eastern booth, the desserts, and the italian booth. There was an interesting lamb stuffed tomato that I loved.   Some of the misses are the Asian buffet (looked like it had been out there all day), the seafood line (put the busiest thing in the corner where the most people jam in?) and the quality of the mexican ingredients.   Good if you get the 24 hour pass and need a place to eat all day. Otherwise, take the cab up to the Wynn or cross to Bellagio. I think you'll enjoy spending your 30-40 there more.",

    "text": "Sunday Dinner review:  3.5 stars, but I'll give it 4 for the heck of it. I didn't expect a whole lot from the buffet at Planet Hollywood, but maybe that is why I was pleasantly surprised. After going to the Bellagio and finding a \"holiday menu\" at the buffet with subsequent elevated prices for the weekend, my buddy and I decided to head across to PH and give that one a try.   The buffet itself can be a little tricky to find depending on what door you come in. It's set in the basement and seems almost forgotten about. Compared to the fancier casino floor above it, the buffet seems dark and dingy. However, it's really not that bad once you get settled in.  Prices aren't cheap, but are decent for what you get. There are plenty of little sections with different types of food, including an interested Middle Eastern section which...well, half of it seemed Greek. Maybe they think Greece is in the Middle East? Meh...  They even have hot AND cold snow crab legs, which were fairly decent (though the hot ones were a bit dry). I found them better and easier to eat than at the Paris buffet a couple days prior.   Dessert was really boring. It's basically just a big section of cupcakes. People love cupcakes, I know, but come on...can you serve anything other than cupcakes? Sure, there are a few other things hidden in the shadows, but not really. I tried two, and one was very good...but the other wasn't.   Service was good but not great. She got us our refills and cleared our plates, but didn't smile throughout the process. Oh well, I'm getting used to that at buffets in Vegas.   I'm giving it 4 stars (again, rounded up from 3.5) because it was better than expected. If I had gone in with the foolish mindset of getting something as good or similar to Wynn of Bellagio, I would give it 2 stars...but I would hit myself for being that stupid too. For what it is, this is a fine buffet.",

They had tons of stations organized by regions of the world: Middle Eastern, American, Italian, Mexican, Seafood and Salad.  I tried the shrimp cocktail, shrimp tempura, pesto pasta, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and designed my own taco.  Nothing was particularly good except the shrimp tempura and sweet potatoes.    This was the buffet with the most esthetically pleasing desserts.  They all looked amazing, so I grabbed a chocolate cream pie, creme brulee, eclair and fruit tart.  Nothing tasted good.  I then decided to get myself some chocolate custard to satisfy my sweet craving.  It was completely liquid and melted.  Disappointing since I'm big on desserts.    May be worth stopping by if the meal is comped or you're a Planet Hollywood guest that is too lazy to go anywhere else.  I wouldn't pay to go back.",

Don't waste your money here it's not worth it anymore.",

Yet, at this point, a buffet is a buffet is a buffet if it is not one of the two high end places in town. There are some items that made up the low, mid, and high points to our meal.   Low- Chinese/Asian- The variety is non-existent. Nothing noteworthy. The crepes are premade and placed back into a frying pan with butter to warm up.   Mid- Crab legs were anorexic, but at least they were split for easy access. The shrimp were pretty standard as well. Desserts are all standard.   High- The left half of the Middle East section. Dolmas, Marinaded Feta, Baba Ganoush, and the beef. The meat was seasoned well and very tender.   At one time they were voted Best Buffet by the Review Journal. Part of me scoffs, because it is the Review Journal, and a part of me agreed with them back then. When it first opened, the Middle East station was amazing and innovative. It is still a stand out option, but that is because everything else went downhill.   The line is long, but the employees work quickly to get the guest in. The price is steep at $31 for okay food.",

    "text": "We ate here last June because we had 4:00pm show reservations for the Popovich Comedy Pet Theater at the V Theater (If you like animals and circus acts without the cracking of the whip, then go! But that's another review for another time). We decided to show up early (12:30) to pick up the VIP tickets and take a walk around the Miracle Mile Shops. All of a sudden, our 9 year old daughter says that she is hungry and I opted to get the family a nice treat. Besides, I had not eaten here since it was the Aladdin. As we approached the buffet, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the line for lunch was fairly reasonable for midday weekday lunch.  Much to my surprise, nothing had changed about this place except for some cosmetic touches to the dining area. The salad section had fresh bamboo shoots and whole peeled beets (score!). There were so many sections to choose from that I did not want overdo it on one section.  The seafood section was pretty good. The sushi looked OK but it s buffet sushi.  The highlight of the station is the crab meat stuffed sole and paella. Delicious and well seasoned.  The Middle Eastern section was to die for with flavorful hummus, naan bread, tandoori chicken and chicken curry. The tabouleh salad and the curry sauce were good as well. The only meh part of the meal was the shrimp Pad Thai. Since I am 1/2 Thai, I did not expect a Vegas buffet to perfect Thai cooking like they do here in the LA area where I live. Could have used a little more tamarind, but I like my Pad Thai a little tangy than most. I'll give the cooks an A for effort since they used the right type of rice noodle (Sen Lek).  If I wanted Thai food, I'd go to a Thai restaurant.   There were many places to hit but the stomach only has so much room.  Unless I wanted to relive the scene from Monty Python's movie \"The Meaning of Life.\"  (I'll refrain from spoiling the scene)  Our 9 year old loved the dessert buffet. The fresh spun cotton candy was the highlight for her. I took a bite and it was pretty good. The flan was delicious and the cannolis were pretty good as well. I like the Orleans' cannolis better at the French Market Buffet but the Spice Market's were not bad. No pecan pie that I could see but that's not a deal breaker. My wife had the bread pudding and said it was OK.  Will definitely come back and eat another meal at this buffet. Next time we'll try to see if we can get in at the tail end of lunch so we can try some of the dinner items when they change from lunch to dinner.  If you do a Google seach,  you can find $5.00 off coupons for this place which they will take.  Now I need to find the 25% coupons that I have heard a lot about.",

It felt like the food was prepared off-site in a factory and just warmed at the eatery.  I was expecting tasty South West Asian food, but instead it was canned Dolma, Hummus that tasted like diarrhea, and Chicken Kebab meat that tasted like super dry chicken breasts.  The deserts, they looked industrially manufactured off-site.  The coffee tasted worse than Mess Deck or Chow Hall coffee.    I wonder with plenty of 5 star reviews, I wondered if those customers were more drunk and intoxicated than an Infantry Marine or Deck Department Sailor suffering from ETOH poisoning.    The price wasn't even worth the crappy food, for better food, go to the Area 52 Chow Hall.",

They do have food but none of them look appealing even when you are hungry. The dessert station was full of cupcakes which I don't eat even on a regular day.

We really enjoyed the variety, but we have come to find out that the variety has decreased a lot and the size is half of what it once was (they called it a \"change of concept\" when I emailed them-- yeah, right!). They are also not honoring the coupon in the 2017 Las Vegas Advisor coupon book, which seems really lousy to me. I know they lowered the price, but that was undoubtedly because they lowered the size of the buffet. If they would have changed their policy in 2018, that would have been fine-- but the Spice Market Buffet was part of why I bought two Advisor books this year. I am thoroughly disgusted. They've lost some customers in us. There are too many places to go around town to have to deal with the Strip and that mile-long walk from the parking garage to the buffet. What is wrong with the Strip? They're making it less and less desirable as time goes on.",

    "text": "First of all, I would like to say thank you to Nikki, the cashier supervisor on May 18, 2015. She was very professional and respectful during our first encounter. She knows the True meaning of customer service. Thank you very much for resolving the issue we had during our visit at Spice Market. However, I am giving this restaurant 1 star less because of the issue below:  I would like to state that i really do not appreciate a waitress who treats me like crap. It was my first time buying the 24-hour buffet pass. At the registration booth, i was informed that i could purchase this at the spice market buffet. Since we were hungry, we went to this buffet for dinner. The cashier did not tell us that there were two options--pay the one time buffet pass OR pay the 24-hr pass. Since it was our first time, i thought she charged me the 24-hour pass (in my mind at the time, this was the only option). I was very hungry so i signed my receipt without looking at the total Amount charhed, went straight to the buffet, and ate my heart out. Then later, when my mom asked if i have kept the receipt (so we could show the receipt the next day), i realized that they had charged me less than what i expected to pay. I went to the cashier that charged my card and asked her to that i originally wanted the 24-hour pass and the total Amount charged was incorrect. She blatanly told me that since 15 mins already passed, she is unable to upgrade the ticket. I told her that i wished that she had asked before charging my card that there were 2 options available for purchase. Also, this is not an upgrade or a refund. I simply would like to be charged for the 24hour pass that i originally wanted. She immediately defended herself stating, \"i always ask everyone which option they'd like to buy\". She obviously did not in my case. She sounded like she is not blaming anyone but the customer. Even though i asked nicely if she could reconsider, she did not at least make me feel valued as a customer, who is willing to pay for what was wanted. She did not even offer to consult with her manager, which was the better way to resolve the situation rather than leaving the customer upset and unsatisfied. Anyway, i don't want to mention her name. But please, if you are reading this, make sure you are REALLY asking each and every customer whether they would like to purchase the one time pass or 24-hour pass. Also make sure that since you are working for a customer-driven business, you are making sure that you are making your customers feel respected, valued, and happy.",

    "text": "Came here around New Years, it was probably one of the worst customer service experiences I've had. I had come with a friend of mine and her younger cousin, when we went up to the counter the woman who was handling our transaction told me it would be $80 for the three of us, I handed her my card and she gave me the receipt to sign. But upon looking at the receipt I saw that I was charged nearly $40 more than what she had originally told me. When I asked her why this was, she said \"oh I forgot it was holiday pricing I clicked the wrong button that's why I told you the other price.\" And she did not seem apologetic at all and wasn't even trying to be nice to us, she made it seem like she just wanted us out of there so she wouldn't have to deal with us anymore. We would have been fine paying the holiday pricing, the thing that really aggravates me is she neglected to inform me that she had changed the price and was not going to be charging me the amount she had told me. We were confused with what was going on and she dismissed us and started to help the next customers and we stood off to the side. We decided to talk to one of the other employees and I very politely explained the situation to her, harboring no negativity towards her because I understood it wasn't her mistake and there's no reason to be rude to her. But once again, we were met with attitude and a strong sense of disdain towards helping us. When I explained that the first employee didn't tell us she had charged us the holiday pricing instead, this second employee said \"okay but it IS holiday pricing so she's not wrong\" and I explained that I understood that, but I wasn't informed of it and the attitude I was receiving combined with this mix up was making me want a refund instead of dining here. She delayed in giving us the refund, she clearly didn't want to, and ended up calling their manager down ten minutes later because she was the only one allowed to give refunds. When the manager came she was actually really nice and gave us our refund with no hesitation and apologized, but these employees were terrible and completely ruined the experience.",

I did fill up on salad but you don't go to buffets for salad.  They had a lot of desserts. I ate a fruit tart and some cake.  Their drink selection is pretty good.",

The buffet selections are pretty standard, but I would not recommend this buffet to anyone who doesn't eat spicy food. The vast majority of their food is spicy, and their entire Asian food section is spicy. Our server was very slow and never checked on us to see how we were doing. We had trouble flagging her down to get drink refills and such throughout the dinner. They have stuffed sole, grilled zucchini, broccoli, crab legs that are split open already (fairly standard at buffets on the Strip) and small assortment of mediocre desserts.  Maybe we came too early for their dinner rush, but the food wasn't refilled that quickly and some of their food wasn't actually that warm. The environment itself is very dim and the AC wasn't that strong. The small saving grace is their cotton candy station, which I have yet to see at any other buffet on the Strip.",

Mostly domestic. Offers an array of dishes from around the world - Mexican, Middle Eastern, Asian, and American to name a few. They also have a Salads and Seafood section. Crab legs galore, mussels and shrimp were fantastic to feast on. Not a fan of their 'slow-roasted' Prime Rib as this was rather salty. Most food items were pretty salty in fact. LOVED the dessert section. The Creme Brulee was DIVINE! Lots to choose from and they even make fresh crepes in front of you although you have to queue up for one of course. OK buffet choice which isn't as busy as most, but you can definitely get better elsewhere.",

    "text": "My husband and I took advantage of the Travelzoo deal ($39 for 2... normally it is $29.99 per person for dinner if you are a total rewards member... free membership... or $30.99 for non total rewards members) and decided to eat dinner at this buffet this past Thursday. We arrived around 5:45 pm for an early dinner (we had a really early lunch and so we were hungry) and did not have wait in line. But as time passed, the line started to get pretty long (so come early if you don't want to wait... no one wants to be around a hangry person).   Anyways, when I saw the overall rating for this place on yelp (3 stars at the time of this review), I wasn't expecting much but decided to purchase the Travelzoo deal anyway to save some money while on our weekend getaway. Well to my surprise, the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worthy for this review).   Just like most of the other buffets in Las Vegas, there are different stations to choose from (Seafood, Soup, Salad, Mexican, Dessert, Chinese, Mediterranean, American). In the seafood section, you will find shrimp, snow crab legs and muscles. Unfortunately on the opposite side of the seafood section of the buffet is nearly empty (Mediterranean, 2nd soup station, 2nd salad station & Mexican stations are located on this side). But it is nice that there is less of a line on this side of the buffet and I really enjoyed the food items from both the Mediterranean and Mexican station. Also there was more selection to choose from in the salad station on this side (but of course I know most people are not thinking healthy greens and vegetables when at a buffet, especially one in Vega$).   I least liked some of the offering at the American station. Here you will find a carving station (where I got lamb, but wasn't too happy with a big thing of fat... most of my meat was just fat... gross!), sliders (chicken and beef) and so forth. The chicken slider was not quite flavorful at all. The bun was really hard and the chicken was one of those mini breaded buffalo chicken patties (tasted like something that was frozen and reheated). The beef slider wasn't good either.   I loved the dessert station (right in the middle of the the buffet). They actually have blue cotton candy that you can have, which was quite fun and light to eat (also makes great for photos). There are so many sweet choices of desserts, unlike other buffets I have been to along the strip that didn't have as many great choices. You can get cupcakes, flan, cake slices, tarts, crepes made to order, etc (there was also one macaron cookie available) and make your own ice cream sundae area as well.   Although the food offered here isn't the best on the strip, it is still pretty good (especially at the price for what we paid.. by the way, after the voucher, we still had to paid an additional $3.16 for the tax) and wouldn't mind coming here again in the distant future (it's Vegas, I know I will be back soon).",

First of all, Maritza ( or possibly Maricella) was our server, and the best server we had in buffet setting during our visit to Vegas. Our glasses never went empty. We worked our way in a clockwise fashion. stuffed sole and peel and eat shrimp were the highlight of the otherwise uninteresting seafood section. Onto a yummy looking italian section where i sampled meatballs that would make my Nonna hang up her apron. a huge breakfasty section was mostly avoided- except for some eggs benedict , egg itself was a bit firm for my taste, and partner had a lovely supercheesy beef slider. My favorite part of the buffet was strangely the tabouli. It was the best tabouli i had ever had in my life... fresh and light and perfectly lemony. hummus was good, dolmas good. Why on earth would you put pita in a basket labeled Naan? shaking my head here. Tandoori style chicken while good, lacked traditional flavor. High quality olives were available near the imported meats and cheeses, I missed this station initially starting from the other side. Don't miss this station, everything besides the mortadella was primo. I would also like to give the pastry chef a big ole hug. Most of the other buffets we went to had the same exact stuff; i'm guessing that the MGM properties make all of their desserts in the same place and have them delivered so Spice Market was a real treat. Was particularly smitten with the angel food cupcake with a mini canoli popping out of the top, i can still taste it- simply amazing. I had a few other bite size treats but wow, that cupcake was the star... I hope to go back in the future, even sans discount!",

Without breaking the bank at buffets like Belagio, spice market is a bang-for-the-buck buffet. My top pics at this buffet:  Crab legs, Mediterranean kabobs, pork loin, and definitely the french silk pie!",

The food here is totally amazing. The seafood was actually really good and fresh, which is always nice for a buffet to have. But the thing you're definitely looking for is desserts. Raspberry cheesecake and carrot cake? YUUUUM.  BTW when I was there I bought this buffet deal thing that was apparently working for all Harrah's casino buffets. Basically it was like a 24 hour pass, and within those 24 hours you can go to any buffet as many times as you want. Definitely a deal, so take advantage of it if it's still available. It only cost $34.99 I believe =]",

The crab legs are nice here because they are pre-split so you don't have to crack them open yourself, saving you valuable minutes of gluttony time.  The food here is separated by regions, such as Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, etc.  Being at least a platinum Total Rewards member really helps here because the line for the more plebeian customer gets very long in a short amount of time.  In general, the quality is decent; they are going for more variety while sacrificing some quality vs. a small amount of foods that taste absolutely spectacular (as is the case with most buffets).",

There's also $5 coupon out there if you google it, so we saved $20 for group of four, which is pretty sweet deal especially in Vegas.   For food, it was very good for its price. Although it's little bit below Bellagio Buffet quality, it gets the job done without a doubt. Selection was plentiful, I couldn't try all of it even I stayed around there another 45 minutes or so LOL. You gotta try cakes, those were fantastic in my opinion.   One bad thing about the buffet? Well.. I got on the escalator to the casino floor and saw Pai Gow Poker Table. You know the story.. lost $250 in one hour and left bad taste in my mouth afterward LOL : P",

    "text": "I went with my family for brunch a bit past noon last Sunday.  The line was long but moved pretty quickly and we soon excitedly entered the buffet, with its \"fare from around the world.\"  While they did appear to have many stations from Middle-Eastern to Mexican, upon approaching the stations, we found that they had very few choices at each of those stations.  My mom was particularly dismayed at the seafood station, with its sorry selection of a few kinds of shrimp, a couple kinds of salmon, one more old looking fish and no crab or sushi in sight.    I went for the Middle-Eastern food; the pita bread was on the harder side and the hummus watery.  Not good, not bad.  The pasta was possibly the worst I've had (made me think of cafeteria food) and there wasn't much I could eat from the Asian station, since I don't eat meat, other than seafood.  My dad and sister seemed to enjoy the few cuts of the meat they had at the American station.  After I tried the seafood, I walked around to look at all the food and see what I wanted.  I went to the salad bar, to make my favorite spinach salad but walked away when I saw a BUG about a half inch long in the spinach.  I thought to myself at first, oh my... well - I guess it is hard to wash every single bug out of the many pounds of spinach they must put out daily.  But it's a restaurant; shouldn't they be responsible for cleaning the vegetables enough to at least get out a large bug like that?  My sister was indifferent about all of the food, except for the bread and the tempura shrimp, which she liked.  Their garlic bread was my favorite thing there, other than a couple of the desserts, but I didn't pay $25 to eat bread.  The fruit was good, as was the dessert (I liked the cannoli), except for the crepe.  The best part was getting cotton candy from the dessert bar!    All in all, the bland and poor quality of the majority of the food (and the bug), as well as the sad selection, outweighed the fun desserts and good bread.  I guess our expectations were too high for the buffet.  If you go with no/low expectations on a weekday for lunch at a lower price, maybe you'd find it worthwhile, but I would have much rather had one dish that was really tasty.  How could this have been the #1 buffet in Vegas?",

They were still serving breakfast in the late afternoon, which was totally a plus for me.. and everyone else in Vegas who struggles to wake up any time before 12:00 haha. Most of the food was pretty average-- nothing out of the ordinary. I'd have to say my favorite part was the \"Mid-Eastern\" section in the middle of the buffet.   Since we came in so late, they were actually switching out the breakfast/lunch food with the dinner selections. This was pretty awesome because we paid the lunch price and actually got to eat some crab legs too! If you're trying to save time by only eating one meal in Vegas, I'd suggest hitting up the buffet in the late afternoon. :)",

Absolutely horrible.  While I was waiting in line I noticed someone with a full plate of ACL. I asked the employee where did he get it. He said he got it from the back and it was for a \"Diamond\" member. Before bumping into this guy, the man behind the glass said they ran out of ACL. BS!

The size of the buffet was cut in half, the workers said it was due to flooding and that most likely repairs would not be made to return the buffet to what it once was, a delight.  Sadly the food was no where close to the options they once had as they've crammed everything into fewer food stations.  The worst part is that the price remains the same, even though the quality and quantity is severely lacking.  So disappointed!",

    "text": "I recently came back here and noticed this buffet got a lot smaller from what I remembered! I used to really like this buffet because they had so many different foods and lots of different varieties/choices to choose from. There's barely any seafood now and the food options are very limited. Their Groupon deal used to be so worth it since it also had all you can drink which came with unlimited wine, beer or champagne. The food is still alright, I just wish they had more seafood and more food options to choose from. I remember they had so much more to offer when I came here a couple years back. A little disappointed this visit!",

    "text": "First - you will not have cell service or the ability to check in when you get into line because the buffet is located underground.  What used to be a great buffet has succumbed to the average.  No longer do they have crab legs of any kind.  Their desert area now has items you can't see, but can still ask for.  They still have cotton candy and cream Brulee (both you had to ask for but didn't have a display for).  The place is clean, the service is good.  They do have a Pepsi fountain machine - so you can choose lots of different flavors of soda (yes, including Mt. Dew!).  I used to recommend this buffet to friends visiting, but will think twice now that they changed some things.  The nice thing is, it is cheaper than it used to be.  The visit tonight was dinner on a Saturday night at 6pm and there was NO line.",

    "text": "Spice Market Buffet, how you've aged terribly over the years. You were once one of the best buffets for the price on the strip.  How far you've fallen from those glory days.  I read a lot of reviews before I posted mine, people who gave you over 3 stars are straight TRIPPING.  You need to re-evaluate how you eat in life.  As a Vegas veteran of over 15 years, you were always a staple during my visits.  Tonight we arrived (5PM on Friday) only to learn that you no longer do the 24-hr dining pass on holidays.   29.99 for dinner, okay no problem.    Upon exploring the buffet area, we noticed that 1/3 of the seating area and food selection on the left side were missing.  Under the \"seafood\" sign, you had no seafood.  Pork sliders I'm certain do not come from the ocean.   The ONLY seafood you had were baby shrimps at the other end of the buffet, next to stale caesar salad.  No crab,  no more sushi, nothing.    Under the Italian section,  you had ONE penne pasta AND no pizza!  Under the Asian food section, 4 items consisting of fried rice, bao, egg rolls, and one other item that we didn't touch.  Alas, straw that broke the camel's back for me was your \"Chefs Special,\" CHILI DOGS.  Who the hell is your chef?!  Chef Mike, Mike Rowave?      Again, dont fall for all these other amazing reviews, you've been warned.    Deuces Spice Market, you're dead to me.",

We walked up to the host stand to get seated and the cashier and two host were all standing their talking to each other and just ignored us until they finished their conversation. Mind you the to host were facing us. So they clearly saw us standing there.   After being seated we were greeted by our server who was very nice and had a wonderful smile. Thank you to him.   The food on the bars were dried out and had no flavor. I kind of expected a lot more because 5yrs ago I came here and enjoyed it. So I brought my Husband here, after raving about it for weeks. Lol   The cooks came around to the other side of the bars to fix foods and straighten up but never fixed the labels on the food. Some foods had no labels, wrong labels or just completely in the wrong spot all together.   The freshly brewed Tea was the best part of our buffet experience. Also a delicious strawberry cupcake on the dessert bar.   We also ordered two glasses of wine but they tasted like the bottles might have been opened a year ago. After traveling down the the Mexican food bar you can see inside a room where dish tubs and 10bottles of wine just sit in a corner. Filthy mess. We just left after that.  Thanks to our friendly server, cupcake and the fresh brewed tea.   People don't waste your money here. Go to McDonalds for better food and customer service. Lol seriously",

It reminded me of a dish I made at home and it went perfectly well with their fried rice. I enjoy the different types of food to choose from. Varying from Mexican, Asian, Salads, and so forth.  I thought that the staff were very accommodating with their service. They kept up with finished plates and made sure that we were enjoying our stay at the buffet.

There wasn't a long line which was a positive, but the majority of the food was underwhelming. The available meats were not very good and the selection was so-so, including the desserts. They got our drink order wrong and I almost felt like the server was giving us attitude about it. We were Diamond so we got seated in a special section but it's not like it's anything that special. At Harrah's you get a whole separate plate of special crab legs, but here you just get a special area? I'd rather take the Harrah's buffet. My husband thought they had the best zucchini and squash, so if you're a fan of that maybe you'll enjoy it.   I feel like with so many other great buffets in Vegas, why waste your time on this one that is just medicore?",

We where the first few people in front of the line for we arrived 9 45 am. By 10:30 a cashier came up taking customers. So we paid for the meal hoping we going to have lunch soon.  To my surprice another line was being formed downstairs. No one was seating the customers. So we had to wait another 30 min to get to our tables.   This is truly stupid coz lunch is more expensive than breakfast. There is no point of making people wait if they have paid for lunch during breakfast hour.  I asked the server why such a system. She told me that employees takes there break during these times. In other words, the buffet is understaff.  I tell you the food is no better than any great Vegas buffet. Go somewhere else.

I tried the almond-crusted seabass from the American section, but it was very salty and tough.  The ltalian wasn't appeal, and the seafood, while tasty, seemed a bit oversalted.  My husband enjoyed his food from the American section, though, and everyone else I saw eating seafood clearly liked it.  My favorite part of the meal was when our server informed  us of the best nightclub in town and told us that she liked going there because \"the African-Americans had rhythm and liked to shake the booty.\"  (Direct quote.)",

I'm not sure if they do it all the time, but they offered us an unlimited booze for $12 deal on top of lunch (beer, white wine, champagne and bloody marys included only). Probably the best booze deal on the strip if you stay there for a few hours like we did! Most of the food is delicious. Nobody leaves hungry.

But that was even too difficult I guess. We had the 24 hour buffet pass, so we went to this one. Paid. Waited to get seated. Waited some more. Waited some more. I would say it was 15 minutes to wait to be seated, there was nobody seating people. Finally taken to a spot. We sat. We waited to get a drink. We waited some more. I told my friend to go get her food, I would wait and order the drinks. Waited some more. I had to flag someone down, then two servers argued about our table number and whose table it was. (Yes, ladies, everyone in the area heard you argue). Finally our server came, annoyed, and took our drink order. When she returned it was incorrect. *sigh* Reorder and wait. After that it I saw nobody interested to find out how we were doing, if we needed anything, or if we were alive. I do believe when the server arrived to clear the last of the plates I got a pleasant surprise of her rolling her eyes back when I spoke. Gosh, such love.  What was even more wonderful about surviving the cold looks from the staff was watching them ooze and gush over the older couple sitting ONE table away. They got red carpet treatment while we died of thirst. Not one server deserved a tip in that place for the service that they failed to give.  Food was decent. Nice selection for the price. No soup bowls for soup at either station. Boooooo. So if you eat soup on a plate or with your hands, your in business. Cupcakes looked great. They didn't taste great though. Just ok.",

    "text": "We stood in line almost an hour to pay and be seated - not because there was a super-long line, but because these people don't give a tiny rat's butt about their potential customers.  During this hour, we dealt with a pissy, inconsiderate cashier with one of the most terrible attitudes I've ever encountered (Veronica, honey - you SUCK at customer service).  She stalled people, saying she couldn't check them out, then would send them to another register, only for folks to be turned away & come back.  Upon the hungry masses descending on her again, Veronica suddenly had to count change in her register.  When another lady showed at the next register and desperately starving people crowded around her, she loudly announced, \"I'm NOT a cashier.\"  The service here is simply abhorrent prior to the meal.  Even the seating hostess we had the pleasure (displeasure??) of encountering couldn't deign to mumble a greeting. The actual food was alright. Decent selection but scarce - there were no salad products on the salad bar. Desserts were mostly cupcakes presented in a lovely display, but they were dry and tasteless.  The only positive we encountered was wait staff - the girl who brought us beverages was courteous, attentive, and even smiled on occasion.  Overall, there are far better things to waste your $$$ on in Vegas.",

Lunch is about 20 dollars and dinner is about 30 dollars. I asked my wife what were the stand out items and she said  the seafood paella, fish and chips, sliders, crab legs, and pretty much all of the desserts. I agreed with her. I would give this buffet 4th place after Bacchanal at Ceasars, Buffet at the Bellagio, and Bayside Buffet at Mandalay Bay. I would come back here again if we are in the mood for good seafood paella.   FYI: For a good discount, buy some ticket vouchers at those Tix 4 Tonight booths around the strip. Save 30%!",

    "text": "I love Vegas Buffets. LOVE THEM. Here are some quick tips:  1. The Spice Market Buffet is located in Planet Hollywood, in the middle of their casino floor, and down an escalator.  2. There are any choices for food, but the idea is to feature the world as a smorgasbord.  I remember heading down the escalator to the Spice Market, while thinking to myself, what the hell why is there a buffet underground? Anyways, I digress, the food here is pretty sub-par. There are many better destinations to choose, and the crowd here sort of shows it.  The one thing that I can say about their food is forgettable. I don't even recall a single item that I really liked. The crab legs that they have at the place were decent. For some reason, they don't feel as fresh as the crab legs at even the Bay Buffet or even stack  up to the Bacchanal Buffet.  The other thing that I noticed is that the food from different parts of the world seemed to vary in quality. Either they were decent representations or they were horrible misrepresentations. As a controlled test, I try the Asian themed stations at every buffet to see what they get right. Here, I think everything that they put out didn't even stack up well to everything else.  The Spice Market Buffet is just as expensive as the Bay Buffet or even other places along the strip. I guess for the value it isn't that bad, but the idea here is pretty much more options, less quality.",

It wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. I've eaten here many times before... but years ago. They have crab legs for dinner... but it's cold. However, later I saw people asking for it steamed, so I guess you can get it warmed up as well. The prime rib here was good - tender and juicy. The variety of food is not as vast... but food is not bad.  I guess many places are copying Wicked Spoon and doing small individual portions because they had some items served like that here. The fried rice, fried chicken, and shrimp cocktail I got were in individual servings. I thought the fried rice was pretty good and that the Asian selections did taste \"Asian\" lol. They had Asian chicken wings... and they did taste like how I marinade them at home. The BBQ pork buns were quite good as well but very soft! The bun falls apart very easily! The fried chicken was also juicy and tasty.   I was not too big on the desserts here... but they do have a large selection of cupcakes! However, the cupcakes are typical size cupcakes, so it makes it harder to try more flavors. I like mini-cupcakes because you can try more. I also got a crepe, but the crepe itself is pre-made. They warm it up and fill it with whatever you want. if you want good FRESH made crepes, the Paris buffet is the way to go.   I would eat here again if I was doing the buffet of buffets deal... but probably not if I was paying full price for the buffet itself. Even though dinner is over at 11pm, I believe you can still eat till 1130 or so... at least that's what I heard the guys saying at the table next to me. They came in at 1045pm.",

They are snow crab legs but they are already sliced down the middle to make it easier to eat. If the crab leg selection doesn't look that great just kindly ask the worker behind the counter to refill it! The shrimp were not that big but were already peeled and ready to go.   The fish was moist and stuffed with a tasty buttery crab stuffing! They had some interesting things that other buffets don't have like a whole section for middle eastern cuisine~  Our server was really nice and after giving her a little tip and after she realized I drink a lot of wine, she just left the whole bottle with us LOL   We left stuffed, happy & pretty buzzed! The regular price for the buffet is around $30/person.. I only think that is worth paying if you eat a lot crab legs and drink a lot of wine!   HOT TIP: before you leave ask for an alcoholic drank to take with you~!!! more bang for your buck!",

For the price and advertising I expected there to be more variety.. Not. The salad bar (basic buffet item) didnt even have tomatoes. There was lettuce, cheese, dressing, mushrooms and croutons. Middle Eastern, sounds good? Cold pita and no gyro.. ALL the meats served were bland and dry. The only decent items were the soft serve and a few desserts (the cupcakes looked nice but the cake was super dry)  Its Vegas, I should have known to go with my instinct and eat at the Rio.",

    "text": "Not entirely impressed with this buffet. It's not in the same ranking as Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, but it's not a typical Hometown Buffet-esque buffet either. I'd rank it as your more-than-average-but-not-by-much Vegas buffet. (If you understand what I just said, then you need to lay off the buffets. You and I both.)  My cousin and I came by for a Fourth of July brunch. They had a special menu that really wasn't that special to begin with.  The only reason that I was tempted to give this place a go was the fact that they had a Mediterranean section. But they got me good, cause all the Mediterranean food was tasteless. Chicken and lamb kebabs were dry, tabbouleh wasn't terrific -- just everything in that section wasn't great.  I really enjoyed the prime rib though. But that could be found at basically every Vegas buffet. (You just gotta believe it's there.)  Desserts were dull, too.  The rumors are True. When you're in Vegas, you gotta give those $50+ buffets a try. Anything below that is a gamble. But I guess that's what Vegas is all about, right?",

Yes I'm that picky ;P. My family got there early on a Saturday around 6-7, the line wasn't too bad then, but later on....ehh.   The most interesting and colorful display was the desserts. It had a crapload of cupcakes, cotton candy, ice cream, and those key desserts on separate plates. The cupcakes were the only things I was disappointed in, they have so many! they look so good! But the red velvet didn't taste that great :(  If that Groupon did not exist, I don't know if I would be able to eat here and not feel bad for my wallet!",

We had recieved free 24 hour buffet wristbands after speaking to a manager about the rude check in lady at the Caesar's buffet.  We are staying at Paris and PH is next door so we decided to try their buffet since we wanted to get the value out of our wristbands.  They had a very nice selection.  Most everything was super tasty.  I would reccomend the italian and seafood sections the most.  They had a really good looking section for middle eastern food but we were stuffed already.  Not being a big buffet person, I would definitely reccomend this since they had a good variety and better quality then i expected.",

I especially loved their chocolate covered strawberries. I didn't eat the meat, the steak, but the bf did and said it wasn't that good. Overall, I would come back here, but a lot hungrier. We had a HUGE nasty strawberry daquiri on our way to Planet Hollywood which filled up our bellies. Wish I was hungrier, but hey, that didn't stop me from eating like a horse! (As always =P)",

    "text": "It pains me to give it only 2 stars because years ago we enjoyed it very much when PH was the Aladdin. Majority of the offerings are much unchanged since that time.  We had dinner here 1/16/13. It was peak hour and long line, so we opted to pay the $10 or $12 line pass. Paying for line pass not relevant to number of stars given in review. Shrimp weren't that tasty. Most of the other foods were only fair.  Middle Eastern section has lamb kabobs that are good.  Got three of them first time through.  Went back for more and there were none.  Also no skewered chicken or vegetables.  They were cooking, but I was told would have to wait at least 5 minutes.  That to me was outrageous.  I remember their dessert table, while not all that extravagant, used to have selection and was tasty.  Used to have amazing fruit tarts -- always. Now,desserts consist of just minimal selection (including crepes that were premade and stacked up like 50 little frisbies) of nothing worthwhile and an abundance of cup cakes. Yes there were many different kinds of cup cakes, some good, some bad, but essentially the entire dessert bar consisted of cup cakes. Apparently they think having just cup cakes is a lot better of an idea than their patrons do.  Went for breakfast next morning (stayed at PH and had 24 hr. buffet pass). At breakfast, I saw staff taking fruit tarts off baking trays. I was told they were for lunch. When I mentioned I love them and was looking for them at dinner previous night, I was told they should have been put out.  That person told me dinner staff was lazy and that's the only reason they weren't out. They then offered me as many as I wanted.   I will stay at PH again and go to Spice Market for breakfast as it's convenient and okay for that meal. Although if I weren't staying at PH I would skip breakfast too.  I will not give it another try for dinner.  Dinner buftet I'll save for Bacchanal at Caesar's or Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan.",

They had a section dedicated to each type of food, from seafood, american, italian, asian, mexican, middle eastern, and so many different types of desserts its not even funny. Actually, it is so not funny, that it is funny... Ha Ha.       The main food that i liked was the usual prime rib because what Las Vegas buffet doesnt have Prime Rib... It was bloody, just the way it should be and yes... it became good friends with my mouth. Also there were endless king crab legs and shrimp. A Meal fit enough for a Hilton. The service was good too, never saw the bottom of my glass. Thanks Omar for all of your great service. Keep it up and there will be many more Washingtons in your pocket.      Watever food u can think of they probably have it. The asian part was a little dissapointing tho, maybe because im asian and i know what the good stuff is... I didnt try tthe mexican food or the soup/salad because i want to get my 28 dollars worth of food. The fruit was good too. Watermelons were crisp and juicy, and they had lichee which was bomb.      For dessert there were so many things it was hard to see what they didnt have. I ate crepe and ice cream. Also some rugula or however u spell that stuff. The crepe was really good becuase they put strawberries/peaches and glaze on up with chocolate. By the end of the meal i got so full it hurt to breathe.     Overall this place was the best buffet i went to. Aladdin, thanks for the food and freeing the genie.",

Last time I came to Vegas, spice market was my favorite buffet hands down, but it just didn't wow me like it did last time. On the plus side, the wait was much much shorter. Last time I came here the line stretched out all the way upstairs into the casino but this time the wait was only about 20 minutes, and would have been less if not for an extremely large party ahead of us causing a logjam.  The food here was good for the most part, but the prime rib was the worst I had on my trip to Vegas. On the plus side, they have a great selection of various ethnic foods to go along with the typical fare. I didn't have too much of the seafood since there was a long line there, but the crab leg meat fell apart too easily. The desserts were a bit strange. Instead of the cutesy artistic and small portions the other buffets I went to serve, spice market desserts were very traditional and in ordinary slices. This was actually a downside for me, as I don't necessarily want so much dessert, I just wanted to try them all. At least they tasted good.",

We got there early enough to beat the worse of the dinner crowd, and had nearly no wait in line.  Our table offered a great view of the many suckers who arrived later and elected to pay the extra $12 to enter the speed pass-esque priority line.  Out of everything we had only one thing - watermelon - qualified as very good.  The rest was mediocre, sub-par or downright inedible!  Of particular note were the Mega dry and unappetizing bread/roll offerings.  Nothing like a crumbling, bone dry roll to get your dinner off to a crappy start!  The ever popular crab legs were so so at best, being on the smallish size and in some instances stringy (instead of offering those to-die-for yummy chunks that may be had from good, properly done legs).  It was also disturbing to see so many foodstuffs that didn't even LOOK appealing, amongst the various sections of the buffet.  Major, major disappointment, and not because we're overly picky (as my next review re: Bellagio's brunch bufdet attests)... perhaps a microcosm of Vegas... shovel out your cash, and don't expect a good return on investment!!!",

For $20, I guess you get what you pay for; especially since that's CHEAP for Vegas. I honestly can't tell you what I liked the most because the food there was sub par. All of their \"international stations\" were really sad looking. They had cold grilled veggies in the \"salad\" station which was deceiving. Grilled is suppose to be HOT not COLD. Seafood station was also upsetting. No CRAB LEGS!!! Really, what Vegas buffet does not have CRAB LEGS? Moving onto the \"italian station\" - also very upsetting. They didn't even have a basic spaghetti with meatsauce/marinara/alfredo. It was pizza and breadsticks with some type of nasty looking pasta, and grilled \"hot\" veggies. OH and they had scrambled eggs at the italian stations, weird?! Next up was the breakfast/dinner/mixed with everything station. I wanted a small piece of prime rib, asked for med well, and got rare!! Ugh, I HATED wasting food. It's very upsetting when you go to a buffet, and when the waiter takes your plate, all the food is still left on there. Now that's when you know that the food was not good.   SIGHS, I would have rather spent that $20 at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. At least their food was good.",

We really enjoyed the Planet Hollywood buffet and everything it had to offer, so when my boyfriend said he wanted to try a buffet on his first trip to Vegas last weekend, I knew we would have to come here. The price is fair considering the cost of food on the strip and the selection you get here. We also paid the additional $24 to jump the line as it was HUGE and we were starving. With my Players Club card that I signed up for the first time, we got a nice little discount and were seated right away. We quickly ventured off to see what they were offering. Crab legs galore (which they topped up regularly and were nice and hot), a great seafood selection, Italian food (including pizza), American offerings, Middle Eastern, Asian, Mexican, and a great salad and dessert bar. After about 12 plates each of food, we were thoroughly satisfied! If you're looking for a good buffet in Vegas at a moderate price point, Spice Market is your best bet. We might try the Bellagio or Wynn buffet next time, but I highly recommend this one!",

    "text": "There must be a reason this place was voted Best Buffet of 2007 -- and my brother and I discovered on this random Memorial Day weekend exactly what that reason was!  PERFECTION.  We stumbled upon their special \"Memorial Day Weekend Brunch\" -- how lucky were we!!!  Although there were a few glitches here and there -- most of which have already been enumerated by many a Yelper prior -- the good points definitely more than greatly outweighed the bad ones.  Let's go with our basic Pros vs. Cons list.  PROS:  most food is freshly placed out on a consistent basis; overall the buffet lines don't ever seem to be insanely crowded (and we came on a Saturday lunch/holiday weekend); the seafood newburg (sp?), raw oysters, crunchy shrimp tempura, \"casino clams\" (trust me, they're garlicky and delightful!) and PILINGS of crab legs were absolutely delish; the Italian's station's gnocchi and osso bucco were incredibly tasty; the prime rib and bbq meats over at the American station were melting in my mouth; the tabbouleh, falafel, and mint au jus (not all together) at the Mid-Eastern station was most excellent; the flour tortillas at the Mexican station were definitely freshly made; the sushi rolls didn't have too much rice wrapped around them; our server was kind and quick, and she kept our champagne and OJ filled to the brim; the made-to-order crepes were to DIE for and capped off a perfect afternoon of gorging and gluttony-ing.  CONS: $3 extra if you want the champagne (although I guess $3 for AYCD isn't really THAT bad, but considering that at most places here in Vegas it comes with the brunch); a somewhat slow-moving seafood line due to the fresh steaming of the crab legs and a slightly disorganized server behind the counter (suggestion: grab small bites like the sushi or small Asian fare while waiting in line); salads were described in a yummy fashion but didn't look that appetizing; Mid-Eastern \"tandoori\" chicken and lamb were slightly dry, tough, and game-y, and the pita bread was a bit hard; Maryland crabcake benedict a bit of a disappointment; was too filled to my brim to try other things I wanted (like the make your own Belgian waffle, make your own omelet, soups, etc.); lobster ravioli at the Italian station was a bit salty, as was the BBQ sauce on the pork ribs at the American place; Asian selections didn't look appetizing at ALL; and finally although the wait was only about a half hour total at most, there is an intimidating-looking line starting in the casino, then you finally get through and down an escalator to...  another snaking line!  bummer.  BUUUT, bottom line is that the Spice Market Buffet is TOTALLY worth it all -- the wait, the occasionally rude buffet goer-slash-tourist (plus, it was UFC weekend, so trust me, more than one brutish UFC-shirt-donning sumbitch cut in line and/or attempted to exchange words with me and/or my brother while at this establishment), and the sometimes hit-or-miss with the selections.  However, hello?  It IS a buffet and the odds are that you will find something here that you'll enjoy.  Since the food is so fresh, the service is so great, and the overall vibe is clean and customer-friendly, you just won't be able to go wrong here even if you tried.  P.S.  There was a wedding reception going on too (only a handful of guests though, about 20ish, so it wasn't intrusive or anything).  But I have now found my inspiration to get married -- I want my reception here at the SMB!",

Service could've been more friendly. When we were seated, our drink orders were taken. Milk was closer to warm than cold. Since the buffet is huge, my wife and I decided to walk around and preview what was available. I pretty much immediately regretted spending $40 on what was sure to be a sub par breakfast.  Half the food I took was under temperature, and a lot of what was available looked VERY old. For a 9:30 breakfast in Vegas, this seems a little disturbing.  They started bringing out cupcakes before we left, and some were pretty good. But honestly, nowhere near good enough to ever bring us back. If you're hanging on to \"Best Buffet in Vegas\" from like 5 years ago, I think it's time to refresh. I can't imagine paying for a dinner here-- there's no way it can be that much better.",

We got to the front of the line to grab some grub at PH. The lady took us in and asked us how many.  \"Four\"  She looks at us...  \"Oh...this guy can help you.\" and she points to her counterpart  Coutnerpart looks at her...I look at her and both.  \"You can't take them?\"  \"There are four, I only do singles.\"  So just right there, makes me sad. My buddies and I were pretty disgusted about that experience and we haven't eaten.  So we sat down and grab some food. That was disapointing. The soup feels like it was from last night. How can I tell? Noodles in a chicken noodle soup shouldn't look pastey and falling apart. It should be nice and firm.   Salad bar seems lacking and everything is a repeat on the other side. All the foods are seperated. There's Asiantown, Indiantown, Mexicantown...they are not named that but you get the idea.  Soups are against the wall. Salads, well not sure what happened there, didn't have much but fruit.  This is really not worth the trouble. If you have that 24 hour pass I would pass on this one.",

Got in line and the girl turned around and said \"Actually, the line is over there\" I looked \"over there\" and laughed at myself, I knew it was too good to be True. They cut up the line so that it wouldn't block the walkway in the casino. Ok fine, got in the right line, waited 20 minutes, reached the escalator to go down into the buffet area to see....holy cow!....another long line -___- I know this is typical of the buffets in Vegas and i had a \"buy one get one free\" coupon so FINE! I'll suck it up and wait to save $35.  50 minutes passed by and we finally get to eat. Went to the seafood section first to get my sashimi. There's none :( Already know it was going to be a bad experience. Walked around to see what they had to offer and I was not impressed. The salad bar was NOT fresh at all, the vegetables been sitting out too long. The avocado at Mexican station was all brown and the salsa chips were stale. Tried a whole bunch of food and did not liked anything I put in my mouth. It's only redemption? The prime ribs. Even the dessert sucked, wth.  Good thing we had a coupon, would never ever ever pay full price for this buffet and will never ever ever come back.",

So I paid 39$ for my friend and I to drink ourselves drunk... Pretty cheap for Vegas. I didn't find one decent thing to eat in the entire buffet, I should have known because it was on groupon. I don't recommend paying full price, it isn't worth it. Also, the servers run around to clean tables and refill drinks, don't forget to tip them! We left our server a 20$ tip and he literally catered to us and brought us bottle after bottle of champagne. Tipping with these guys will ensure you get your money's worth on the all you can drink portion. At the end, he told us we made his night and that was pretty awesome! Overall great experience despite lousy food but don't pay full price.",

The girl at the desk was a little bitchy when we handed her the Groupon, she firmly stated that we still needed to pay the tax out of pocket and that it was not included with the Groupon, ok that's fine, so we paid and then we were seated right by the counter where people come in to pay, so annoying since the place wasn't even half full. Anyways, the food was bland, the wife said the BEST part of her entire meal was the mashed potatoes...I enjoyed the pork strips from the Asian food section. The desserts (cupcakes, cake, etc) were dry and looked as if they had been sitting out for days, the creme brulee has a layer of liquid sitting on top of it, totally unappetizing.  I'm so glad we didn't pay full price for this.",

It was around 2 pm, and after wandering around the mall, looking for something semi-decent, we desperately stopped in here.  To say that my expectations were low would be under-selling it. This is not like the Bacchanal or the buffet in the Bellagio. This is more like a fancier Golden Corral or Furrs Cafeteria.   There two decent sized salad bars, plenty of cheeses, breads and cured meats, and an around the world theme with different stations with different themes.   I really enjoyed the broccolini in the Italian section, and the mashed potatoes in the American section. Everything else was fairly unmemorable. The fish and chips was pretty greasy, the pizza was bland. The hummus was mediocre.  The major reasons to come here are the price and convenience.

I mean it's like you're eating in a basement cafeteria. It was kinda sad. At least it was very clean and there wasn't a wait.   This was actually my 1st Vegas Buffet experience ever so there was a lot of pressure and the Spice Market delivered on a few fronts. First off, it was cool to see they had a Middle Eastern and Mexican food sections - you don't see that too often. And they were actually quite good. It also had the run of the mill Italian section, pizzas, salad bar and carving stations. Everything was just A-OK. I actually can't really remember anything in particular jumping out at me.   The desserts though, surprisingly, were pretty fantastic. Full size slices of various different cakes, cheesecakes and pies plus tons of different kinds of miniature tarts and cakes and cookies. PLUS cotton candy!!!! What buffet has cotton candy?!?!   The following day, to continue our 24 Hours of Buffet theme, we hit up the Paris Buffet. PH blows Paris out of the water. That place sucked! Definitely come to Hollywood for better eats. Who knew?!",

Maybe it was the dry, warm cheese. It could have been the fact that there was no chicken kabob, or that most of the food was unoriginal. Or the hummus tasted weird.  No, it was all of that.

The muffin on the eggs benedict was gooey, and the egg....hard! The peach compote served next to the french toast was brown in color and did not look fresh! Do I need to go on???

I went straight for the seafood as always. scrawny Alaskan king crab legs. Tasted like they were sitting there since last week. Hardly seasoned. The petite cocktail shrimps were only lying there since last night. i finished a handful of them. Raw oysters were big, juicy and probably should've been cooked instead. A little scared for my stomach after. but fear not, i had no ache!  I had the prime rib next. did not look too appetizing, a little fatty and a little too cooked for my taste. Hmm. I stuck with one piece. The kebabs were dry and hard. The lobster bisque was pathetic. Two spoonfuls and let me proceed to yak.  I got a crepe to order. It was swimming in oil. i took one bite and ate all the strawberries. never in my life had i seen such an unappetising crepe!  I think i pretty much had no appetite after that. The tiramisu wasn't half bad, but nothing to call home about.   Tip: don't come here. go to aria, bellagio, wynn or mandalay bay! it's practically the same price! Or pay half the price and go to monte carlo/new orleans or mgm (I think it's cheaper there?)  Favourites: they have oyster?? not half bad cocktail shrimp  Do not want: everything  Last words: Waste of $30! (or $25 since we had the VIP dine4less card)",

    "text": "First off, no service, so check-in first...  The buffet is located on the basement floor decorated with an extravagant entrance arch. The escalator was broken on the other side (coming back up to the casino), people were complaining...I thought it was good...(You just ate...think about it as exercise). Anyways, we walked inside and saw the buffet of buffets deal. So of course...I bought that! I may be a girl, but I sure can eat like a football player! =]   The selection here was a salad bar, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, American, and desserts. The salad bar was not very good because everything looked very limp. You could tell whoever bought the produce doesn't know how to choose the right fruits and vegetables. The Asian entrees were a bit salty...not a fan. Italian area looked very good, but quality wise...not so much. The pasta was a bit dry as well as the meatballs. Another disappointment like Bacchanal Buffet...Guess Vegas wasn't set for Italian foods? I'll just make my own Italian dishes =]  The Mexican area I would have thought would have been good, but I was disappointed. The nachos that I created was falling apart. The chips were thin and couldn't hold much of the ingredients. The toppings were not made fresh except the pico de gallo. The guacamole was watered down. The meats didn't look very good and just sitting there drying up...The cheese quesadilla was not good! It wasn't hot and the cheese was hardened. All I have to say is that I was sad...  Nothing against Mediterranean foods, but once I tried this awhile back...I wasn't feeling very well, so I can't say much about this station. But the kabobs looked nice. American selection wasn't that great...I asked for a rare slice of prime rib and they gave me well done, not very good with service. (Could have said to wait for the next one to come out). So I decided to wait later and the meat was a bit of a tug to eat, but descent though. There was also sausage and ham. Chicken noodle soup at first tasted good, but the second bite...man you definitely can taste the black pepper. (Broke a sweat...JK!) The macaroni and cheese didn't look that good to eat...should have stuck with my first impression, but decided to take a huge portion still. This tasted horrible...the macaroni was cooked thank goodness compared to Bacchanal Buffet...but the cheese was overcooked and didn't have enough flavor. Another disappointment.  The dessert station was like watching Cupcake Wars...WAY TOO MANY! Just looking at the different flavors of cupcakes made me want to chuck everything back out. I did try the red velvet cupcake and it was dry. The icing...do not know what was sour in there...Then, I tried the fruit tart, which was not very good except the crust. The cheesecake was extremely thick and bland.   Overall, I would not recommend coming here, but we got to Vegas late and stayed at Paris...So the second closest place to eat was Planet Hollywood. However, service here was ok...not the best. Didn't take plates very often. Also...where I sat...it was broken...so I got a bruise on my booty... =( I guess the unlimited apple juice made up for it though =]",

They have peel and eat shrimp but that's not a great substitute when you're wanting real snow crab legs. I'm the plus side the mimosas are included in the Sunday brunch so hey how can you go wrong. Started with Le Village at Paris this morning probably would have been better to start here at Spice Market. Definitely recommend this place. I'd give it 5 stars if they had crab legs. Oh and for meat lovers I recommend the flank steak. The prime rib was good the flank steak was delicious!",

The service on the other hand is poor, if I have the option of 0 star I'd.  We went last Saturday and waited forever for a table to open up when there were plenty that were available. While we wait one of friend needed water and she looked extremely pale so we asked if we can just get some water or may be just a bottle, which was right at the counter. To our dismay, the lady said \"Oh no this is for employees only\". Really? This big hotel has water designate to \"employee only\"? So we waited and my friend passed out from dehydration and almost had to go to the hospital over a $1 Water bottle.  It is a shame that they don't value customer. They'll only care when you either passed out or about to go to the hospital.",

Excellent: crab salad, prime rib, asparagus,  veggie egg roll, mint chocolate cupcake with chocolate ganache filling, chocolate mousse with some kind of apple topping and whipped cream. I would definitely come back for these items. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. There were probably 10 or 12 cupcake flavors like red velvet, s' mores, and oreo--perfect if you have always wanted to try all those crazy flavors from Cupcake Wars. We noticed one customer was upset that there was no cake...I think they just needed some guidance.  I tried several more additional food items and they were fine, but really not remarkable. The other people I was with had the unlimited beer and wine. Beer ranged from Miller to Corona and Sam Adams. Comments on the wine were not so favorable.",

    "text": "Another lengthy line for the buffet, although I suppose if the buffet receives good ratings then it's where everyone wants to eat.   I went around lunch time so the line was about 40 minutes. Terribly confusing how they got the line..because the buffet is downstairs and when you walk to the escalator you see a rope across it, so meaning wait for someone. So I did and gazed at the menu for a bit.  An employee standing a few feet away by the tables asked a few people who were behind me if we all were going to the buffet and pointed a line behind a pillar.  No sign telling you where a line was and everyone was concealment behind a huge pillar in the casino. I am not a tourist, so I do read signs, but if they don't have none for me to read then it's their fault. So several people got in front of me as I walked around the rope and shook my head.   So waiting there among about 10 people in front of me, so I was thinking it wasn't that bad. We waited for about 15 minutes and then a gentleman opened the rope and let us all through. Once downstairs you see the True line.  After I get to the cashier they include another line for waiting for the host to seat you. The lines are really bound together, so the people wanting to see the cashier are bunched in with the people ready to be seated. I feel sorry for the employees there because they have a hell of a job with all these people.  The food was good and they have lots of selections. I went to almost every area to try something. Well stocked and food was hot.  The server filling drinks was smiling a lot and very kind. He was quick and did his job well.",

With eight strip-facing casinos, if you join the total rewards program(which is free, calm down), you can purchase the buffet pass for just $35 that allows you to eat as many times as you want within a 24-hour time period.  Now I know you're thinking, \"How many times can I eat there in just one day?\" but think about it this way: Instead of sitting for over 90 minutes and gorging everything you can fit into your mouth(which I have done before), you can come back and forth or even go to OTHER buffets and eat smaller meals.  Anyway, this buffet like others has ethnically separated areas for you to easily pick what you want. From sushi to indian to a salad bar, this place has what you want covered...unless you're from Estonia or Turks & Caicos...but what's the chance of that. (No offense if you are from there, just making a joke).  Don't go for the flash of the Wynn and Bellagio, eat here!",

But anyways this buffet is located on the basement level of Planet Hollywood and when the lines get really long particularly on the weekends, it can snake around the casino towards the strip entrance. They even offer you to move to the front of the line for $20! But if you are a highroller for their Total Rewards program then you have your own line to avoid this cluster FUCK. I prefer the Mlife program because they have better buffets and nicer resorts (Bellagio, Aria, Mirage, NY NY, Monte Carlo, Mandalay Bay  and the lower tier Luxor and Excalibur).  I always experience great service here except for a few that are minor, the food is just your typical Vegas buffet and not over the top like The Buffet at Bellagio and Wynn also the new Bachannel Buffet at Caesars (REALLY IMPRESSED).  The decor is just plain with movie posters all around the Buffet and the staff has their favorite movie posted on their name tag I thought was pretty cute. The dessert station was the best with the fresh made cotton candy, lollipops, crepes and the usual cakes and gelato ice cream. This isn't on the top of my lists for buffets but I wouldn't mind coming back.",

The only redeeming factor is the fact you can get bottomless mimosas with the buffet price, which we only found out after I saw pitchers of it being refilled.  I wish they told us when we sat down, such wasted stomach space of diet Coke.  Well anyways, every area was fail.  Crab stuffed Sole was more bread stuffing than anything, the Italian area was purely pastas, the Mexican was just sad, the dessert crepe was super oily and just inedible.  The only thing good was the omelet cause it was made to order and warm and the Mediterranean area which had good baklava!  Also I got to smuggle out baked goods.  The apple turnover and bear claw were definite winners.  I need to find a good weekend buffet place.  Someone HELP!",

SERVICE: My friend misunderstood the prices that were posted on their website because she missed the part about the price going up in February and it was February first that day. The lady at the cashier was absolutely RUDE and would not even listen to my friends explanation, as calm and nice as she tried to be. The service at the table was great though with our water always being refilled and plates taken away in a timely manner.  FOOD: Great selection with food from different cuisines: italian, chinese, mexican, middle eastern, and seafood. The buffet selection was great as well with cotton candy and TONS of cupcake flavours. We loved that there was a huge selection of cupcakes but many of them were actually dry.   PRICE: It was $25 per person for their lunch buffet",

I absolutely LOVE this buffet because I am really into middle eastern food (hummus, etc.) but what really makes it for me is the bottomless mimosa (I believe on weekends only). People complain about the price, but drink enough mimosas and you can come out way ahead.  My friends and I always have a great time here; there is something for everyone and for a buffet, the food is pretty damn good.

I was surprised that there weren't more breakfast options, especially with sections dedicated to food from specific regions.  What's a Mediterranean breakfast like?  I still don't know.  The most popular station was the dessert station.  There were a dozen varieties of cupcakes alone.  You'd also find cheesecake pops, cotton candy, cookies, soft serve ice cream, and various danishes.  The only thing missing was some pecan pie.  And more breakfast items...",

What I noticed this one had compared to other buffets that was different was the drink machine. It was HUGE. And it came with an assortment of drinks to choose from. Definitely a plus for this place since we didn't really have to ask for our drinks; we just got it ourselves.  Overall average buffet, similar types of foods you'd expect from other buffets, but for a decent price .",

I went specifically for the lamp kabobs which were tasteless, the Dolma very salty and overall everything was just over cooked like it's been reheated several times. Customer service was non existent. I asked for tortilla and after 10 minuets they refilled it with equally old and dry ones. I could've stopped at any taco truck and gotten better tacos for a fraction of the price we paid. Definitely a no go if they continue this way.",

    "text": "Hmmm I've always been interested in this Buffet, as it's often hyped up to be one of the biggest buffets in Vegas. I finally visited this place today with my family, and sad to say it didn't really live up to the hype at all.  The buffet is pretty big, with various selections of food. There are quite a lot of sections, such as Asian, American, Middle Eastern, Mexican, Salad, Seafood, and Desserts. Despite this, none of the foods really stand out. The food was mediocre, and I didn't feel compelled to ever want to visit this buffet again.   I think the worst section here is the desserts. They served cupcakes, mini cakes, crepes, tarts, and ice cream, but not a single one really made me want to take another bite. I probably sound conceited or stuck up saying this...but if you're looking for a buffet with a good dessert selection, I would say pass this buffet and look somewhere else.  The upside about my experience here was our server, who was very attentive and came to check up on our table often to see if we needed to remove extra plates, or needed any refills on our drinks!",

It is a step above all of the other buffet offerings because it creates some very nice gourmet style dishes for us to choose from. The desserts are fantastic and perfect for our taste. The atmosphere is classy yet upbeat casual. I've never experienced a bad dish at this buffet. I highly recommend it to people with good taste in food and a little bit of time on their hands to enjoy it.",

I do have to say this is the second buffet I've tried and maybe I haven't tried enough in Vegas but, this place offered so much I could barely get through it all. I had a mimosa but, there was so much food to try to fit in any drinks or I would've had more. Our waitress was super nice and even came a few times to refill our glasses with champagne! Hopefully, I can go back one day to try the wildfire cooked pizza. Also, purchasing our meals through Groupon helped out a lot.",

The table service for drinks was TERRIBLE during the two times we patronized this location.  At one point my empty coffee cup took 30 minutes to refill and it was with cold coffee.  Table clean up was non-existent until almost the end of our meal.  I had plate upon dirty plate stacked up -- possibly 6 plates -- until they were finally taken away,  The cashier was rude and unprofessional.  She demanded to see my ID before I could use my credit card (no problem) and then insisted I take off my hat so she could make sure I was the same person.  BTW my credit card had my picture on it as well.   Given the small number of selections I felt the place was overpriced.  I'm not saying it was bad.  Just that it was below what I expected for a nice hotel.  Much better buffets in other hotel.",

No other buffets that I have gone to in the last few years offer this large of a variety of foods, including lamb kabob! Huge variety of foods here. The crab legs are already sliced in half so you dont have to worry about breaking them. How cool is that? Great dessert selection including one of my favorites, flan.  We were able to get a great deal on Groupon for 4 people at $75 and it was well worth it.  Staff here are great, polite and clean up dishes and refill drinks promptly. For an additional $12/person you can have all you can drink beer and wine.  The decor here is average, but in all honesty, decor takes second place to the food. Right?",

The only things I could recommend here is the decent dessert bar, the Mexican corn on the cob, and the king crab legs. The miso soup, potato soup, and chicken noodle soup were bland and cold. My coffee even came out cold...disappointing. The Mexican food looked like dried up pre-made tacos and quesadilla. Asian cuisine was bad bad bad, don't even try it.

I've always like the Spice Market buffet because it much different then the other Caesar buffets plus it stays open the latest which makes it a great place to start your 24-hour buffet pass. My first clue should have been how much it went down in price. I got my pass and walked in and saw. THAT IT WAS HALF THE FUCKING SIZE!!!   More then half the buffet went away. They got rid of prime rib and crab legs!!!! And everting else was bad. Like really bad!!!  It was sad. Caesar shrink there buffets and I'm tired of it. They did it with the Rio and Paris. There is no reason at all to go to the spice market. I would love to complain but who would listen. If like me you love to do the 24-hour buffet pass there is no reason to ever do it again.

Like a lot of buffets, The Spice Market divided the food into different ethnic foods more or less.  Popular foods in America such as Mexican and Italian had its own separate areas but other categories included Mediterranean and Asian.  I also remember a seafood and dessert area.  They did have sushi in the seafood area.  The sushi was all very fresh which is not always the case in a buffet setting.  Spice Market also included crab legs which did not require any additional charge.  If the buffet still has these following items I recommend them: wild mushroom pasta (in the Italian section) and the egg custard bun (in the Asian section).  The desserts were decedent and delicious.  Eat the dessert.    Groupon was selling a deal for this particular buffet.  There are also coupons floating around in the Vegas area.  Like I said above, we did the Buffet of buffets.  We liked this buffet the most.  I recognize that there are probably more elaborate and highly rated buffets in Vegas, but based on the price, I say this deserves a solid 5 stars.",

However if all you need is to fill your stomach you can probably spend less and eat well. More is not necessarily better, it's just more.",

We ate some food we considered decent and decided to wait for the dinner, in hopes it would be better. They never put out the seafood which was a let down but probably best for us at the end. We still grabbed a small portion of the dinner and then left very disappointed.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the flan.  Shortly after leaving my youngest daughter started with stomach ache. Long story short, I had to take her to the ER. The rest of us also got food poisoning but were able to take over the counter meds. We will never eat at a Vegas buffet again.",

This buffet is located at Planet Hollywood down below the main casino. The price was about 26 per person, and you can add an all you can drink beer, wine and champagne option for about 15 dollars more.  What I loved most about this buffet were the options of food. They had American, Mexican, Asian, Italian, a great salad bar, and an awesome dessert bar. My favorite out of everything was the tandoori chicken, I probably consumed half the chicken there. The servers were quick to pick up any dirty plates, and the atmosphere was friendly. I also recommend grabbing as many of those mini cheesecakes as you possibly can, I only wish I could have taken them to go.",

Major disappointment, but really no surprise, as cuts are continuous and numerous. Their stock trades at $6.00 a share and i'm realizing that it should be at $1.00 a share, if that. We used to enjoy this buffet for the crab legs.   No prime rib as well, hmmmmm. Just not going well. They said they only have it on special nights.   They also did a remodel and made the place smaller and definitely more cramped. But the plus side is that less people are here, as it's not even worth a visit.   Sadly, even the employees that work here are disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money on this awful buffet. This place will most likely close soon.  Adios Ghost.",

Upon paying, we where told the buffet ended at 10pm and we would have until exactly that time to eat, but patrons were let in as last as 9:45. At the Salad station a female and male worker were arguing in another language and the female was clearly upset and slamming all the bowls she could until we made a comment. The food is tasteless- they even screwed up a quesadilla. Most employees spoke in another language and no one came to the table to see if we needed anything. Everything is self serve. Lastly, I visited the dessert section and there were gnats landing on the desserts and a huge hair draped between dessert plates. I told the manager of these 2 things. NEVER COMING BACK.

I was aware of Spice Market because at the time, they had a Groupon offering although I never purchased one. Since my friend and I were close to Planet Hollywood on our stroll along the Strip, we decided to check it out.  It was about 5:30pm on a Saturday night and the cost was $30 a person. The set up was to my experience, the basic Buffet style chairs and tables with no real, decorative aesthetic that Buffets typically have. My friend really enjoyed his meal and would probably give four stars, but I honestly didn't enjoy the food too much. In fact, I overate and only indulged in one plate as he indulged in um, five!  Every genre of food is grouped from Italian, to Desserts to Mexican, to Asian, Salads and Fruits. Soda Fountains on the far wall by the Desserts.  Staff is quiet and work diligently. Once a plate was finished, someone came to take it to the kitchen.   Bathrooms are adjacent and very clean as well.   Not bad, but could be better. Still on the hunt for my amazing buffet!",

The Food selection was unique, a lot of items you'd never see at most other buffets (like Mediterranean food) but none the less was still a tad underwhelming. I was by far not excited with the selection.   Two things are really cool though:  #1- The buffet has restrooms right there and not all the way in the casino #2- the decor is a nod to the old Aladdin and the retained some of the old look.  Is it worth the money? Ehhh....i don't know I'm teetering between not exactly and barely......decide for yourself though.",

    "text": "The Spice Market is unfortunately no longer my favorite Vegas buffet and is need of a revamp.   While there are a few dishes here that are surprisingly good, for example the prime rib is actually excellent which even at some top casino buffets the red meat being served may be dry or otherwise not so palatable, this buffet's prime rib is currently flavorful, tender and juicy.   The desserts are mostly fine too, especially the made to order crepes which contain a banana Foster sort of filling with chocolate or strawberry sauce. The salads are fine too and the lettuces and spinaches are maintained at a very good freshness and crispness. The kale salad is good as is the Caesar.  The self service drinks from soda and coffee machines I think are actually a good idea.   Otherwise though most of the rest of the dishes are a little dry or just somehow sub par. The middle eastern lamb kabobs are dried out and not so flavorful. You may find a decent dish here and there but over all the buffet is getting tired and in need of a makeover. The number of dishes has been reduced too over the years. None of the food is truly bad - but a lot of it just isn't that great.   No booth seating unless you are a top tier Harrah's casino player but that's not even such a big deal as the tables are large enough and the buffet is currently uncrowded. You may always find coupons somewhere - we used 10% off ones with no expiration that I've had a while - which brought the price to about $22. plus tax each.  With no line wait and a total bill of only $50.64 for two it's probably almost a three star experience for a Vegas buffet but low price aside I couldn't really give it over two stars this time.   The manager Michael whom I've seen present at the buffet for years assured me that some changes are coming and asked that we not give up on the buffet.",

Today, after they \"drywallewd\"  1/3 of the place away (and took many of the food selections away) this is not even par with the employee cafeteria at a IRS office...  everythng is self-service now, basically you need to get your own Softdrink from the machine, i am surprised i was not asked to do the dishes at the end of my lunch. Talking to the employees - they all know what is going on but have no choice but to \"\"work\" there. The Food was mediocre, i personally would not recommend this place anymore. Chances you get a better and fresher food selection at the SUBWAY store close by  ...",

Dinner was good and every section of the  buffet is open with food stations.  Will eat here again if I stay at PH.",

There are counters with Seafood, Asian food, Mexican food, Italian food, American food, Soups, Salads, Middle Eastern food, and of course a dessert counter.  My favorite was the seafood area.  I liked the Baja Shrimp Salad and the Crab Stuffed Sole.  There was also an interesting Seafood Enchilada.    I was happy to find that they had Middle Eastern food, which is not common in buffets.  I tried the Tandoori chicken and it had good flavor (but a little dry).  My friend said the Kung Pao Chicken from the Asian food area was really good (I didn't try it because I can't eat spicy food).  I liked the little baked char siu pork buns.  The Crab Rangoons were way too salty though.  The Egg Drop Soup was good, but it's hard to go wrong with that.    The Italian spread wasn't anything special, but it was edible.    The dessert bar had plenty to choose from and I had three or four different desserts that I really liked (flan, ice cream, cookies).  I've been here twice and I loved it both times.  I definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "HORRIBLE FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE! My friends & I went to Vegas for a girls getaway trip. We purchased the 24 hour buffet for one price which includes 6 different buffets on the strip. The 1st buffet that we went to was at the Rio absolutely amazing food & service. Later that evening we went to Planet Hollywood Spice Market Buffet. 1st off the area where the line is formed is so smsll got a little claustrophobic,  then once we were setted the waitress was unfriendly & made us feel as if she had something better to do other than wait on us. The Roast beef was dry & over cooked, the desert station didnt have much of a variety of deserts just cupcakes. Most of the meats in the Mediterranean station was over cooked & dry as well but the kick in the head was the cold crab legs. I've been to many buffets where if you ask the chef behind the serving station to heat yourcrab legs they are more than happy to heat them up for you. Well when I asked the cheft if he could please heat them for me he said they didn't do that, well then I said ok thank you & sat at my table where sconds later I saw waitresses walk by our table with plates of hot steamed crab, so I asked the waitress if we could have our crabs warm & steamed which she replied no they didn't do that. Then again we saw them walk by with more hot steamed crabs, we were like wth? We called the waitress over & asked to speak to a manager. The manager came to our table after about 10 minutes & we asked about having our crabs steamed. He had attitude & was arrogant & pompous.  He told us they only did that for VIPs.... seriously? W felt less than important not even be able to rate hot crab. Yet they didnt have VIPs in a seperate area,  They lied to us about not doing that & kept walking right by us with hot crab. He could have been a nice guy & said I will make that exception & I apologize but instead he took the douch route & acted like a jerk. I will never go to this buffet again. Us common people don't rate steam crab even though we payed the same price as others. BS!!!!",

Maybe the problem was that we went about 3:30.  Lunch just got over so all the food was probably left over from lunch.  Nothing was hot.  This was a recommendation from a local.

The buffet literally got rid of most of the common food that were most delicious. When we were there this year, the crab legs tasted bland and had a lack of flavor to it and the kabob meat felt like chewing on a rubber band so we ended up spiting them out since it was inedible. It took a great amount of time to choose our food because of the lack of the variety of food that consisted the buffet long ago, before everything changed. This is unbelievable. In addition to the waitress services, they never even once stopped by to refill our drinks or clean up our empty plates. This is a waste of time and money since we waited an hour for this food although the food wasn't worth the price. I can now understand why this buffet is rated only three stars or worse.",

The food was just decent.  Nothing I had was standout , the beef medallions were by far the best and the sushi looked disgusting.  I honestly probably would skip the buffet next time and eat at one of the local joints for much cheaper.",

We got their at 11 so go to enjoy both. My girlfriend was less hungover and absolutely loved it.   The scrambled eggs were terrible and the only thing I didnt like, I shoulda waited in the omlette line cuz of course that woulda been fresh and delicious. Everything else was good. The little tater tot breakfast things were so good, same witht the bacon, and seafood at lunch.  We used two 5/off coupons and they accepted both of them making our total less than 25 bucks for the two of us. It was a great value. Wish I could have ate more.",

The tempura shrimp, and the shrimp scampi were excellent!!! I also found a great selection of desserts which were wonderful.   I have also eaten a couple of times at the Belligio buffet which is why I can't give this buffet five stars. While the quality of the food I had at Spice Market was excellent, I'm not sure any buffet will beat the Bellagio b/c of the HUGE selection they offer--the chocolates, imported butter, the cheese selections, etc. With that said, I will certainly return to Spice Market.",

We stopped in one morning for breakfast because we'd read lots of good reviews about it...and let's just say we were seriously disappointed. And glad we used those coupons so we didn't pay full price for it!  Everything - and I mean EVERYTHING - was cold!! Our first go around we loaded up with eggs, hash browns, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, etc. and not one single thing was hot. Not even warm. Cold. That is not the experience you expect when going to a buffet. We left most of that food on our plates and made a second trip to see if maybe we just needed to stir things around or pick from the bottom of the trays, try getting things from a different area - but arrived back at our table to find the second round cold as well. Boo!  Highly disappointing experience, since everything tasted good - those biscuits and gravy would have been a delight - but who wants to eat cold eggs and meat for breakfast? Which left us wondering too how safe the food was if it isn't kept at a proper temperature!   They had a decent selection and variety, and for the price I'm sure it would be a good value if the food was actually edible. I've had much better buffets in Vegas. Won't be going back!",

I have not tried dinner recently but the brunch is about as good as it's been in the past although the price is now $25 per person. It's not a bad choice if you're looking for buffet type breakfast and lunch, and it's probably one of the better buffets in Vegas.",

    "text": "Meh, I've certainly have had better. Maybe its the seafood lover in me, but I wasn't terribly impressed. Sure they had a lot of categories of food, but I felt like some of it was a joke. I mean.. under \"Asian\" it was some basic chow mein, broccoli and beef, fake looking shumai. I think I could get better \"asian\" food at panda express (no offense to the chefs). Also, sushi was......meh. The only thing that had fish in it was I believe the tuna rolls. The dessert was okay - I definitely did like the fact that I could order a made-to-order crepe. The banana foster + rum + strawberries is quite a good combo, so if you do go order this. The tarts had too hard of a crust, the canolli's were old (shell soggy), and I think I saw a little fly buzzing around. There is a $5 off coupon floating around online - so look for that if you plan on going, otherwise save the $30 and spend it somewhere else.",

No mexican, no chocolate covered strawberries and I also thought they were supposed to have a chocolate fountain.  The crab legs are okay but they are served cold and split which sounds like they would be easy to eat but in reality you get bits of shell and cartlidge and not much crab.  There were four of us and we had 2 coupons for $50 off total and the bill was still $75.00.  Definitely not a $125.00 buffet.  I think it is funny that people go on and on about the cotton candy, that is about the cheapest thing you can make and cotton candy on a buffet????",

Spice Market also has an excellent dessert area. They used to have creme brulee in actual ramekins; they are now the sturdy foil, but are fresh torched and crispy, unlike other buffets. My wife does note that their seafood would be better if they steam their crab legs.",

I'll admit that there's lots of variety and the dishes sound like high quality, but reality set in very quickly. A few dishes were good, but a great many were not. The short ribs were basically just fat and gristle, the cut of prime rib I got was easily 60% fat, an Asian steamed bun with pork was so dry I stopped at one bite, some Mid-Eastern lamb on skewers was so tough I gave up after two bites. You get the idea. The one excellent item we had was the meat balls at the Italian station. No way I'd go back to this buffet.",

    "text": "I must say I was very intrigued when i walked past Planet Hollywood and saw a sign that they had the \"BEST BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS\"  I walked past this sign twice in one day and decided that I was going to be the judge of that!  Well signs lie!!  This buffet was okay.... I've totally had better.    It took me forever to find the buffet entrance... I had no idea you had to take an escalator down to get to the entrance.  So I spent a good time searching for it and had to stop for directions.  The inside of the buffet is nicely decorated and the food stations were separated by cuisine... major plus!  And they had a Mediterranean station... that is a first i have seen.  Granted the section was not that big but i do love my Indian food!  So slowly I go through most of the sections.  Starting with the seafood... everything thing in this section was pretty good... the stuffed fish was a little eh to me tho.  Next was the salad cold section... i'd say... stay away... no matter how good it looks... (remember looks can be deceiving) .  The Asian section can be skipped... unless you do not know what really good Asian food tastes like....  stick to the dim sum its probably one of the better things in this section.  American Section was probably the biggest section and there was nothing unusual here... carved meats potatoes... everything was delish in this section.  The Mediterranean  section had oodles of good stuff.. from curry to tandoori chicken... very good!  Dessert was okay... usually I get almost one of everything that i find appetizing.  I tried a little of everything.. it was all okie.. nothing really special.. nothing that would make me go back for a second slice... except for the chocolate cake... that was amazingly sweet and good.   Overall this buffet was average... you are probably better off walking across the street to the Bellagio or Paris.",

They have a wide variety of foods, and even had more luxurious feeling options than the standard crab legs and shrimp cocktail (delicious of course) like a cheese and salted meat selection with olives and roasted vegetables Mediterranean style. A few items were not up to par like the lamb kabobs which were tough and the spareribs that were dry and inedible, but the quality of the other meats far outweighed these flaws in my opinion. I only had one dessert, but it was absolutely perfect and full flavored made from quality ingredients. Typical buffets tend to have pretty desserts that fall flat but this one was delicious. The majority of the food I ate was meat/seafood, so I can't say much about the \"American\" food standards but they looked good. Also they have cotton candy that you can get made fresh and walk out with. We received excellent service from our waitress and even the coffee was decent, not watered down but pretty full bodied for a buffet. The best I've probably been to ever.",

My advice is to avoid going around typical meal times because the line can get outrageous, but we went to breakfast at about 10, lunch around 2:30 and dinner at around 8 and there was practically no line or wait at any of these times. The selection is good, there is a Mexican, Seafood, Italian, Middle Eastern, Asian, American, and Soup/Salad section for dinner. If you go to the brunch you get free champagne! Make sure if you go you do the buffet for buffet so you can eat for 24 hours for one price. We went for dinner on  our second to last day there, and then on our last day we were able to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff was also very friendly and each waiter/waitress was very attentive when it came to asking if we were OK and if we needed more drinks which was surprising for such a busy buffet. If you like crab legs you definately need to check out Spice Market Buffet because they have crab legs already cracked open for you and you can just keep piling your plate with them (if you're like me). It's quite dangerous, in a good way though lol.",

The buffet itself is really very comfortable, perhaps the most of the buffets I sampled wit Buffet of Buffets. The ambiance is very nice and they played lots of good music! (90's FTW!)  I digress...  Spice Market has a wonderful spread that encompasses a lot of different ethnic cuisines. I tried my best to sample a little of each and all of it was really fare game. I do, however, feel that sometimes some of the food can get dry or stale, and that a little more attention could have been paid to what was out there! I've never seen a buffet actually run out of food (aside from crab legs) for an extended amount of time as much as I had at Spice Market.  The prime rib was very good. Not overly seasoned on the outside crust (which some might like), beefy, tender and medium rare.   The crab legs are served nicely, cut in half along the length of the leg to make getting the meat out really easy. What I didn't like was the temperature. Half were brought out of the fridge, immersed in their own juices and simply served \"chilled\" without ice. These legs had a really off putting flavor and wetness to them. The legs they warmed up were \"resteamed\" but were often not heated enough. Lukewarm crabs aren't so great.   The desserts were good. Cotton candy was a bonus!",

    "text": "People seem to come here when its super expensive, maybe $30 or more and thus, they get all mad about paying so much. Funny how that never happens to me. They must be coming on a holiday or something, where all buffets in Vegas will be quite pricey. Most of the time im paying around $25, which is typically the price on any given day. To me that's a very reasonable price for the quality and selection they offer. Lots of people seem to get too caught up in the Bellagio and Wynn buffet quality and end up taking their anger on the review for this place. I like. It's definitely not the best, but its got a lot of good things about it. For me, the crepes are an x-factor. Im a big fan of crepes and no matter how stuffed I am I can always make room for their crepes and the other desserts they have. I would compare this place to like the high middle class of buffets. And I suggest you give it a shot. Its descent and respectable.  The gist...  PROS: lower prices with a pretty large selection (if youre just wanting to eat shrimp and crab legs, why pay over $30 when you can come here and have the same quality and size in crab legs and shrimp). Also, did i mention they make crepes for you.  CONS: Higher prices on some days may make you feel like you've over paid. Quality is not as good as Bellagio or Wynn. Same goes for seletction.",

One of those prime ribs that are so tender you can chew it with your tongue...it was great.    The buffet is pretty much the length of the room with many different areas - seafood, American, Mexican, Asian, salad, Middle Eastern, deserts, etc.  I recommend scouting the area first then choosing because there are WAY too many choices.    The desert area had crem brule with a better cream than Paris!  This is the only buffet I know of though that has cotton candy as a standard.  It's a great take away!",

The variety of food was amazing and everything was hot and fresh. My only complaint was that this seafood stew I got had fake crab in it. How are you going to offer crab lakes and crab cakes (so you obviously have real crab on hand) and put fake crab in something? Not cool. Minus one star.  The price was reasonable considering the massive selection. And if you are super hungry, you will get your $30 worth. We had a group of 10 people and still got seated quickly. Our server was great. She was fun and joked around with us, while keeping our drinks filled and the table cleared. Actually, I don't have any complaints about the service.  We must have picked a good time to go (or it was a slow Friday) because the lines were short and we got in fast. We did have a little trouble finding it, as we didn't know we were looking for escalators to get down to the restaurant. Overall, a good experience and I would go back.",

    "text": "Have you guys heard?  The Harrah's Group is now offering $39.99 (for total reward members) $45.99 (for non-members) with 24hr buffet pass!  That means you can go as many time as you want within 24 hours!  What an awesome deal!  Now that Harrah's has dominated the strip with at least 8 casinos surely you will find a location that has your dishes in their buffet line!  Now that was not a plug for Harrah's in fact... they probably hate me for sharing such great news to everyone!  If you do the math, each of the buffets on the strip now cost at least $15.99 even breakfast... now throw in already expensive buffets such as the Le Village Buffet at Paris, Rio Buffet, and here, Spice Market.... you are pretty much getting each buffet below the $15 threshold... isn't that terrific money saved for the slots?   Ok ok, I'll stop the sidetracking and stay on course.....(no wonder my reviews are so annoying long?  LOL!)  Spice Market Buffet is located in Planet Hollywood.  (By the way, unless you know Planet Hollywood's location or have seen the sign from far away, you wouldn't know if you stand in front of it.  They don't have any signs showing that is Planet Hollywood except with \"Miracle Mile Mall\" and \"Casino\" posted above their entry way...(My buddy was confused on where he was at but I was able to guide him thru)  Once entered, you get into a line so that you can then be prompted to get into the \"real\" buffet line downstairs.  The Spice Market Buffet used to be Arabian themed but since the take over of Hollywood you will now see posters of movies hanging on the walls.  Not as nice as before as they are trying to be more sophisticated.  Food here really is pretty good.  To me, it's one of the much better ones located in the central strip area.  They had Salads, Mexican, Asian, Seafood, Mediterranean, Italian, and a nice dessert section.    My highlights were the following...  Lamb Kabobs... fresh off the grill dipped in tzatziki sauce.... wonderful pairing as the kabobs were slightly salty which balanced out perfectly with light yogurt/cucumber sauce.  Very refreshing!  However, I'm not a big fan of these grill meats because they tend to be a bit dry compared to the likes of other kabobs (such as Satay or izakaya), but my buddy thought it was one of the better ones he's had so I'd take his word for it.  It is very flavorful though. Got some prime rib with Mushroom Rougut... man... did I ever tell you how much I love mushrooms?  It had the best firm texture these mushrooms which I was so addicted to.  Pairing with a tender prime rib is definitely out of this world.. (I then went back and got a bowl of mushroom only!  Please do not miss the mushrooms if you ever go here!  You will thank me for this!)    Had some salads as I needed to increase my veggie intake, and overall veggies were veggies... nothing special to discuss here but they are fresh!  Had it with thousand island dressing which is always yummy!  Now onto the main portion.. seafood...   Fried sole was absolutely jammin!  Imagine actual fish n chip except the fish is definitely not over battered, and the meat if full and juicy!  If you get a plate of say 6 pieces with some fries, you got your $11 worth already!  They did a great job with their fried fish! My buddy had the buffalo popcorn shrimp as I missed out on it.  He really enjoyed the kick that is added to the crunchiness which is a good pairing.  Very inventive for a buffet as you usually only see straight up deep fried shrimp.  Now onto my favorite dish of them all, a wrapped filet of sole wrapped around crab filling.  For those frequent readers of my reviews, do you remember my experience at Le Village buffet in Paris and the rose filet of sole?  Remember how much I loved that?  Well.... this just topped that because it's near identical except now it's got crab fillings... It's like eating a rose of sole ravioli, then once you bite into it you've just entered the crab cake dimension... OMG delicious!!!    Now you see why I didn't get to more items?  I got stuck on the sole and never turned back.........    I did have a little bit of dessert though... Fresh strawberry tart, Tiramisu (not what I've had in the past which was the only disappointment), and a really cool cotton candy station where everyone can take a cotton candy to go!!!  Kids absolutely love it!  So if you are in Vegas, I strongly recommend you get the 24hr pass (so you have access to the buffet anytime your heart desires / also save money), and visit the Spice Market Buffet.  One great tip... if you want to visit the Paris Buffet, anticipate a nice long wait or you must go early.  If you just simply walk over next door to Spice Market in PH, you will notice that the line is half of the size and also the service is much more faster because Paris moves at the speed of a snail.....  You are in Vegas and every second matters as all the fun and excitement are calling your at all times... Make a smart choice!",

If you want a great buffet, go to Planet Hollywood.  I have been to better buffets outside of Vegas, though, so I'm keeping that final star from this review.    The only critique I will give it, however, is the line.  It can be over an hour wait and, in fact, often is.  I would argue that it ends up being worth it, but still... that's a long wait.      The Spice Market Buffet is simply the best buffet in Vegas.  Amazingly delicious in every way!",

Random Friday night on a slow weekend, so we lucked out. We tried coming back two days later and faced a 45-60 minute wait!  This buffet has several, regional/cuisine themed stations. There was mid-eastern, italian, asian, mexican, american, seafood, and desserts. There were also soup/salad mini stations on both ends of the buffet. The asian section I barely touched because the sushi did not look appetizing at all and there were only 4-5 sad looking chinese items. The mexican food station was pretty much a taco/nacho bar, but still had some good stuff. The italian section had some tasty lasagna and mushroom pasta. The mid-eastern section had some mediterranean food (pita, hummus, dolma, etc.) and some kebabs (a bit overcooked). Standard meat carving station and seafood spread. I really liked the sole wrapped crab item. The There was a huge selection of breads and desserts. Their dessert station was ridiculous. So many different types of pastries, cakes, tarts, huge selection of cupcakes, cotton candy, and a crepe station. The crepes were pre-made, but still very tasty.   Overall great selection and I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

It was $30 the day we went which happened to be Mother's Day and we were told there were additional food that they usually don't serve which is why it cost a bit more. I believe on a typical day, it's about $20. Still, they've got all these stations with themed food such as Mediterranean, Asian, Seafood, Pizza, Salad, etc. This beats the Bellagio buffet in my book.   [Suggestion] *You can ask for a half or a quarter of a waffle at the waffle station. That way you won't fill up or feel as guilty having a whole one.   [Tips] *Don't forget to \"tip\" the table.",

And I will say that I did enjoy the mimosas - they had a good balance of sparkling wine and orange juice. But the overall price was a bit expensive for my taste (probably pretty much in line with most buffets in Vegas).  They had omelettes made to order, which was cool. But that was the only really special breakfast stuff they had. Other than that I got some fried potatoes, smoked salmon, french toast. I tried some of the desserts too and didn't really enjoy a single one.  Overall, nothing was amazing, but everything was ok.",

Glad I didn't get more (and waste it).  I can't believe the cupcakes are 'signature'. I wouldn't put my name on them, that's for sure. They were dry, they fell apart into crumbs when the paper was removed. Didn't see any pie or cake (other than the damn cupcakes).  I can't believe the salad bar was so unsubstantial.  Braised short ribs didn't have anyone armed with a chef's knife looking over them. I took 4 or 5 pieces, but only ate 2. Tasteless, rubbery. No monitoring needed; but then, no monitoring was needed for the kabobs either.  Crab legs were conveniently split, so I ate some of that.  Sir PH: Sucking people in with Groupon isn't going to save the place...a change of menu and attitude is what you need.  I went to Rampart Buffet twice- looking for an upward change at Spice Market. Twice the money, half the quality. Rampart wasn't bad, especially, especially for the price. Spice Market Buffet I would put on par with Circus Circus (ie cheap crap food). If you set high expectations at Circus Circus, it's your own fault.",

I was in a fishy mood last week, so loaded up on seafood: I tried some lobster pasta, tempura shimp, stuffed fillet of sole, smoked salmon and some other things.  I thought these were all good, with the exception of the shrimp, which I felt was mostly breading, and even that was kind of dried out.  The desserts were by no means spectacular, and even though they looked nice, I'd suggest avoiding them, with one exception: the bread pudding; that's really good.

Which was his absolute favorite.  Food - Prime rib is a plus.  My personal favorite is the Shrimp Tempera.  Amazing with the Chile Sauce.  I love the hummus and lamb.  I wish they had a bit more to choose from in their Italian section.  Dessert wise is amazing.  My favorite there was the cotton candy.  Definitely hit the spot.    Definitely a decent buffet to go to if you are near Planet Hollywood.",

    "text": "You really can't go wrong with buffets in Las Vegas. The Spice Market is definitely one of my favorites on the strip. They have a wide range of different ethnic foods to choose from. You have your typical ham carving station, seafood, American, Indian, Mexican, Chinese and others.  What I love most here is their desert station. Their Creme Brulee is too DIE FOR! Once you dig your spoon into this piece of work, you will hear the crunchiness of the top layer down to the creamy insides. It's was so delicious that I was on a mission to find the chef who created it! I spoke with the baker near the desert station, but she couldn't tell who \"created\" it. They just follow directions on how to make it. My fiance thought I was crazy for doing that.  Anyways, a must visit buffet if you're in Vegas. Oh yea... try the Creme Brulee!",

Nowadays, everything has changed.  It's quite alright with me.  When you drop down below to the buffet, it also looks really nice and new.  You'll pretty much get the generic buffet selections, nothing fantastic or out of the ordinary that will have me going back over and over again.  This was the first stop of our Buffet-of-Buffets.  (Quick tip:  if you're going to do the BoB, then make sure to get the free players club first upstairs first before you go down to the buffet, or else you'll be forced to just buy it for full price).  I know that the buffet is priced around $30, but honestly I think I would have a better time for my money at the Wynn Buffet, which isn't that much more.    I feel like I got tricked by how clean and modern the buffet looked, that my expectations went up.  It may be a bad thing.  I usually have a pretty acceptable tongue pallette, but really, with so many choices in Vegas, these places really have to step it up.    The Spice Market Buffet:  a Lamborghini Murcielago with a Ford Fiesta engine.  All show, bareeeely any go.",

Surprisingly there was no line and we were allowed to be seated paying only the breakfast buffet price.  This was the saving grace considering that we learned shortly thereafter that despite the ad for this special buffet clearly stating the inclusion of crab legs, they did not inform anyone that this menu item wasn't served until 3pm.  Anyone unfortunate enough to arrive at say 1130 wouldn't get that option but would pay the exact same price as those who arrived later in the day.  Seems like a stipulation that should be stated in any ad as crab was the big draw for us on this trip.",

    "text": "That'd be an ICK for the food and a YAY for our waitress.  The food was super disappointing. We went in thinking we'd have a good breakfast, lots of options to choose from, and leave feeling happy and full.   Instead, the food was marginal, overcooked and dry. There really wasn't much variety, which was sad, considering they have so many stations promising things like \"Asian\" or \"Mexican\" or \"Italian\". It was pretty much the same thing at each stop, with a few variations.  On my first pass - still nursing some high hopes - I grabbed an Andouille Sausage corn cake, a breakfast quiche, a scoop of hash browns, an Egg Benedict half and some scrambled eggs.  The corn cake was hard and dry, and if there was Andouille sausage in there, it was hiding from me. The breakfast quiche was so dry I couldn't even swallow the tiny bite I took. It was seriously like the Sahara Desert inside that thing. The Egg Benedict was - predictably - overcooked, though that's on me for grabbing an Egg Benedict from a steam table. If the egg was poached when it was set out, all that time above the steam and under the lights just kept right on cooking it.  The eggs and the hash browns were the best things I had that day. Both were buttery and tasty, without being too greasy. Score.  My second pass - hopes understandably diminished, but wanting to get the most out of the buffet prices - was forgettable. I tried some sauteed fruits (peaches and apples), as well as a scoop of cheesy grits and one of the pastries from the sad dessert station, but nothing blew me away.  The best thing about the morning was our waitress, Nina. She had the best personality! She joked with us, made us girls feel special, and made sure to get us what we were asking for. She then made my husband and I feel super special for having participated in the half marathon the day before, even though we weren't feeling extra special at that point.   I wish everybody had a good, friendly, open attitude like Nina did. She's definitely the best thing we experienced at Spice Market, and I hope they appreciate her there!",

    "text": "Back when this was Aladdin, this was one of my favorite buffets.  My boyfriend is in town, and he wanted to do the Buffet of Buffets.  We timed it so that we would have dinner, breakfast, lunch (for him, while I'm at work) and dinner.   We had dinner on a Thursday night, around 9pm.  I was so happy they had three of my favorite things in the world: tabbouleh, hummus and creme brulee.  I make better tabbouleh, I also make better hummus, and I could taste the butane on the creme bruee.  So, I went back and got a cookie instead.  They had naan bread which was delicious.  I ate it without the hummus because I didn't care for the hummus.  I had some mac and cheese, which looked really good, but didn't live up to appearances. I also tried a beef slider.  I took it out of the bun, because it was just too hard...and I don't think it was supposed to be.  I tried to eat just the patty, but it tasted like Burger King.  When all was said and done, my \"dinner\" consisted of: 2 pieces of pineapple, cookie, a piece of naan bread and a glass of water.  We went back Friday morning for breakfast.  I got yogurt, baked oatmeal with peaches, a blueberry blintz , and a slice of french toast.  Unsurprisingly, the yogurt was good, the oatmeal was actually really good, but would have been better if it were less dry.  I just put it in my yogurt.  The french toast was pretty good, but by now, I was pretty full.  I  had a bite of the blintz, it was okay.  I have a rule, that if I'm going to eat sweets or carbs, they must be outstanding to be worth it.   To be fair, I never expect much from a buffet.  I also don't go to them anymore, really, because while quality has gone down, prices have gone way up.  You only save $1 with a players card, and there is no locals discount.  Tonight, we are going to Caesar's.  If nothing else, at least we ate for two days, two people, a total of 7 meals for $125.",

(seafood, Italian, asian, American, middle eastern, mexican, soups+salad, desserts) Seafood and American has to be my top 2 Asian station had oily and poorly flavored food. It's comparable to Panda Express.  Mexican and middle eastern also had some basic options only. Nothing amazing. The dessert option was large and my sisters and I enjoyed trying different things but it wasn't up to par with what we expected out of Vegas. They did have cotton candy tho so that was fun.

All it's offerings though were probably below any other Vegas buffet I have been to in its quality. The selection is large but if I was a fan of super dry and tasteless fried chicken or a random taco bar that looked like it was hosted by Safeway, I would be more grateful.  I don't really think it's worth the money since there are so many other offerings in the area but should you want to see what the hype is about, who am I to stop you?",

Told to wait in line while the rest of our party is already seated and eating. I'm simply not this hungry. If someone else hadn't already paid, I'd be heading home. The snippy little beyatch at the counter couldn't even pretend to be nice when we asked why we have to continue to wait in line, even though we're paid. The line has not moved an inch the entire time I've been writing this - there is one, single person at the desk.  Update: once you get past the ineffective, crabby folks at the front and wait through the ridiculous long lines, the service INSIDE is incredible. Try the lamb. Ask to sit in Yelena's section. She gave our party of 7 the best service I've experienced outside of a 5-star restaurant. She and the cracked crab legs saved them from a two-star rating, because the cashiers aren't doing them any favors.",

We got there at approx 8:40 p.m. We were hungry, we had checked into the hotel and left to have dinner, my bad for not checking their ratings.  I put Talapia,  green beans, mashed potatoes ......ate only the green beans everything else I mentioned was....well I wouldn't give it to my dogs.(True).  Then I tried Spivey chicken wings and bbq ribs....do dry and full of bbq sauce, maybe trying to cover up the dry ribs.  Well needless to say WE WILL NIT BE BACK, NOR WILL I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",

The food is very mediocre tasting, not much flavor, and seems like it had been sitting out for a while, nothing really tasted fresh.  We were excited about the variety of food, but after visiting each station, it was more of the same. The mac & cheese, literally had no cheese in it, it was some type of cream with NO taste... The mussels were very crusty, overcooked, rubbery ... The cesar salad was welted. The seafood pasta had no flavor, some type of cream used again. Even the juice wasn't real juice ..   However, the dessert was the best station. Options actually had flavor! And about 2 dozen choices. Creme Brule was on point! For $30.99 a person for lunch, not worth it. A more upscale buffet at the Venetian or Bellagio may be worth it, but don't waste your money here. We would NOT go back.",

My cousin and I used a groupon for this buffet so it was only $25 per person, but that price is still not worth it.   Selection is small and pathetic. Food is medicore at best. The only thing I liked was the roast ribeye. The crab isn't that good (sorta watery and fishier than most places), the desserts is lacking (DO NOT GET THE CHEESECAKE. EWWW), and I had the worst chicken fajitas ever. This buffet literally has no saving grace. Seriously, save your money and go elsewhere. If my family didn't take me here, I wouldn't even bat an eye at it.   Planning to go to Bacchanal tomorrow, so let's see how hard Bacchanal will whoop Spice Market's ass.   Seriously.

Jayme N. and I were on a mission to munch it up so we could have tons of energy for the EDC adventures we were about to embark upon the following day. However, we should have immediately bounced from this place when it literally took 30 minutes to be seated, because the staff was just twiddling their thumbs instead of ringing up customers and seating them. Already epic fail on customer service.  As for the food, the selections were mediocre at best and the quality was atrocious. I wouldn't even feed this crap to my dog. To make matters worst all three of us got hardcore food poisoning which totally ruined our first day in Vegas.

    "text": "Came here for breakfast on the final leg of our Buffet of Buffets marathon.   Wow. If I had paid for this place, I would have been pissed. Service was excellent. I adored our server. She asked if we wanted a to-go cup of coffee. No one has ever offered that!  The juice was clearly from concentrate. The Mexican and Salad sections were closed. What? No Mexican breakfast? Those are the best dishes!   Middle Eastern included bagels and lox. This was probably my favorite section. I forced fed myself lox with capers to get my money's worth. I liked the mozzarella and tomato salad, but it was something I could find at a supermarket deli.   Dessert section looked like it was filled with mini packaged pastries. I selected a chocolate croissant, but it was flaky and dry, so I skipped it.   On to the American section. There were 2 types of benedicts. They looked good, but I think they became overcooked from the heat lamp. The country style potatoes were good and surprisingly still crispy. I did however, find these potatoes repeated 2 more times. It also seemed like these were the seasoned potatoes you find in the freezer aisle.   There was an omelet station, that I skipped. And I think a crepe station in the Dessert section.   Stopped in the Asian section to get a squirt of sriracha.   I stopped off for a cheese blintz, but never ate it. It was pretty burnt and didn't have much filling. The section also included French toast and pancakes?  There was a nice oatmeal/cream of wheat section. Then, a fresh fruit section where you could construct your own parfait. 2 yogurt flavors, shredded coconut and granola? 2 smoothie options. They were really plain. I think one was banana, the other, strawberry.   The final section included spinach and cheese egg scramble, but I didn't see any cheese or spinach. There were potato pancakes. And a turkey hash which had fingerling potatoes (yum) and roasted peppers. I took the time to dig out the pepper and fingerlings. This was one of the only things that didn't seem pre-made. And it was pretty good.    I looked through the photos for lunch and dinner and they all look like a completely different restaurant! I don't know, guess they dropped the ball for breakfast. Kind of a shame for people like me who love breakfast.",

Must've sent all of the A Team staff over to Caesar's according to their buffet ratings. Thankfully we purchased our meal at exactly 14:59 according to our receipt so we still paid the \"lunch price\". I can't imagine spending an extra $10 per person on the food we ate.  Prime rib was decent. I had some curry dishes that weren't too bad. Ribs were fatty and inedible. I felt like I wasted a lot of food because the quality was so bad.  My husband had a few pot stickers and spring rolls which he said were very good. I can't recall what else he ate. Usually when our food is good we discuss it during the meal and offer bites to each other.  Other than the dessert station, nothing was very memorable about the buffet. It needs an overhaul. Badly.  Double bummer - - their cotton candy machine was broken. That alone was probably the only reason I was in favor of coming here during this trip.  Note to the person who decided how close the booth seats sit in relation to the table top. Try sitting in one of your booths and see if you can actually fit before making it permanent. You must be related to the person who installs bathroom stall dividers too high.",

Then the food at the different stations (Mexican, Mid-East, American, Asian, Italian), food was NOT fresh and somewhat tasteless.  Rice Pilaf was hard, meat was tough, food had been sitting out too long.  The dessert bar was probably the best they had.  They had a variety of cupcakes, cookies, creme brulee, tarts and ice cream.  For $23.50/person...NOT worth it and doesn't even come close to some of the other buffets on the Strip.

The unlimited drinks option is not worth it as the service is very slow so you will only get 1 refill.   The line is very long and moves extremely slowly. Try to go around 6pm as the wait is much longer around 7pm or 8pm. They say Monday is one of their busiest days. I think it is well worth the wait though, because the stations have so many options. The crab, fish and chips, american station, Mediterranean and dessert station were the highlights for me.   Overall, this buffet is great value and the food is pretty decent. The fish and chips, crab and dessert station are really good! I'd spend most of your time there :)",

For some reason the heat lamps are not keeping the food hot. The food is also just plain low quality. There was a prime rib that came out fresh and hot and after I spent 10 seconds convincing the server that I wanted a piece of it, I finally got to try it. It was overcooked and tough.     Food sits out for too long, pasta becomes mushy, meats dry out, the seafood is flavorless and the whole place is overpriced at about $31.00 a plate. We had a cup of orange juice that tasted like soap; we believed the cup didn't get properly rinsed.      The sushi was also very disappointing; you know there's a problem when the placard simply says \"Assorted Sushi\". Your better off eating at the buffet in Ceasers palace for lunch for roughly the same price. I've had dinner at Golden Corral for 12.99 that was overall better than this.",

For parties of 8 or more they automatically add 18%. For lunch is was $23.95 pp with gratuity. We were a group of 7 and they added gratuity at a buffet... huh... dock one star for that.  They had a nice selection. There were 7 bars; a salad bar, mid eastern bar, dessert bar, seafood bar, american bar, italian bar, and asian bar. However, for all the food that was cooked everything was overcooked. I think it was due to the fact that most the entrees were sitting under the heatlamps for hours and not turned over enough. So another dock of 1 star.   I ordered ginger ale and they didn't have it.. Every restaurant in Vegas should automatically offer Ginger ale because that's the best hang over drink.. So instead I ordered coffee and it was very watered down. Another 1 star dock.   All in all, the dessert bar was the best. The crepes were not made fresh but rather \"refried\" with butter in a saucepan and then topped with your choice of berries and frozen ice cream.   I won't be back.",

    "text": "in my books, this buffet is tied with the buffet in bellagio. CRAZY, right?! i've tried several in vegas, and i have to say this is one of the best. i MUST eat here when in vegas.   i think sunday-thursday, you can order your burgers the way you want it. i definitely know it's not offered on the weekends, which sucks. buuuuuut, they do offer an omelette station for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. not an fair trade, but oh well. i've never had the burger, but my friend did and she LOVES it! she only wants to go to vegas during the weekdays just so she can get the burgers here.   it boasts chinese, middle eastern, and mexican foods. it's cool to see middle eastern food cuz it's not too common to see foods from that region in buffets.   and if you have a sweet tooth, the desserts are abundant! anything from cakes to cookies to candies to crepes! i'm always grabbing everything and trying it. even if i'm so full to the point where i need to be rolled out on a gurney, i will make my way to the desserts. and they have freshly spun cotton candy!!! happy happy joy joy!",

    "text": "Unfortunately after reading quite a few reviews, I went to try the Spice Market.  After eating at the Wynn and Bellagio buffets, might as well check some others that ranked top 10 on the buffet food list.  1) Food: Nothing special other than very organized layout.  They had it by region (Middle Eastern, Mexican, Salad, Desserts, American, Italian) so the food wasn't mixed with others and each area had short lines which made it nice.  The food overall wasn't anything special.  The only thing different than any other buffet that I have experienced was the \"COTTON CANDY\".  Talk about nostalgia and so I had to have one.  Let's just say no more sugar was needed the rest of the day or week for that matter.  2) Price: The holiday pricing for buffet is more expensive (by about $10-15 more) so go the wynn if you haven't already.  So far, they have the best buffet for the best price. (speaking on all meals EXCEPT for breakfast...go to Main street station for that....)  It was nice to compare with other buffets on the strip but wouldn't go back.  The management staff was horrible at figuring out groups and seating people.  Don't go during the holidays..it's chaos.   Harrah's management overall is HORRIBLE.  They need a staff training and too bad for Planet Hollywood.  When it was operated under Starwood and Sheraton Properties, they were much more together.  Boy will I miss this hotel!",

    "text": "I genuinely adore this buffet at Planet Hollywood! My college roommates discovered this place and I'm so glad they did. It's nothing like the Wynn in terms of ambiance and all, but I love it.   You get a pretty good selection of food here, and for the price, you don't feel like you're getting ripped off like the Mirage. The quality is actually pretty good! Most of the time we come to eat here, we are in deep into lunch and early dinner, so we get a little bit of everything! So here are the things I love about this place..  1. Crab legs. of course. Not watery, not salty, not too cold. Just everything you would expect of a GOOD crab leg.   2. Cotton Candy. How fun is this?   3. Cookies. I think every time we come here, my roommates steal the cookies. HAHA no joke.  4. Baked Potato Station. You get a card and fill out what you want, and turn it in. The potatoes are HUGE! They load them up REAL GOOD and to my disappointment, had no room for it.... So I can't wait to try that next time. I love potatoes by the way....  5. Burger Station. Cooked to order - or so I've been told. Okay.. it's been 2 years??? And never have I seen the damn burger station!!!! I try and try and try.. lunch and dinner, but NO BURGER STATION!!! So apparently they only do it during the weekdays for lunch (I believe). Darn... I hear they are pretty darn good though. I must try...  6. Eggs Benedict. Not too salty. Hollandaise is scrump-dili-umtious!!   I think those are the highlights. The mexican station is one of my favorites as well.. although the meat could be... tastier? And not look like little drops of poop. But cover that crap up with some salsa, cheese, sour cream, and guac, and you've got yourself a pretty darn good burrito. Oh! And be careful around that station.. for some reason, they always have that shit extra hot so your arm literally feels like it's getting on fire.  So compared to the Wynn, I like both. But for any Vegas first timer, I'd probably recommend this place or the Bellagio simply because Bellagio takes it in presentation, but I do enjoy the food at Planet Hollywood more if you want simplicity and comfort. If you are willing to fork out the extra dough, go to the Wynn.",

Some of the food selections were good but still the same. The prime rib was great :P the other food For EX:  Chicken /lamb were dry dry dry. I needed two cups of water to wash it down. DESERT: The selection of desert was amazing.  The had every thing from crambrula to fresh cotton candy. Every thing was not to sweet but just hit the right spot.

My boyfriend and me went on the Sunday of memorial during lunch, it was 75 bucks and although the food was ok, the service was sooooooo bad. Our sever brought our first drinks and then disappeared, almost an hour later I asked the server on the next table for drink refills and she seemed bothered but did it. And then still didn't get any more service. As we were leaving I asked the second server  what happened to our first one and she said that she was our server and the other server who disappeared were Hmmmmm, why  did she keep that info to herself when I asked her what had happened to our server earlier. WOW, you have a server who pretends to not be your server, unbelievable. I spoke to manager and told him how bad the service was, we have much less at other places and gotten 10 times better service than this, he apologized and asked us to please come back and give them another chance. I should have refused, it wasn't about money it was the whole experience, but I thought maybe they were busy over the holiday so accepted his offer for us to go back. The next time we went on Tuesday around 1pm, this time there was no server to ask what we wanted to drink, just a paper on the table for us to check off what we wanted so we didn't have to wait for the server and go straight to the buffet, she still didn't bring all the drink we checked off, she never came back once to check on us, service is so bad. Run away from this dump, the only thing good about this place is the location, go eat at a regular restaurant and get better service, or go to the Cosmopolitan Wicked Spoon Buffet, its a million times better, a bit more pricier but well worth it.",

I don't have much to compare to quality-wise because I'm not a Vegas buffet connoisseur, but this was pretty good! I'm a huge fan of middle eastern food, and their hummus and babaganoush were surprisingly good. I usually expect that quality only from middle eastern restaurants!

I've always heard that going to buffets in Vegas is the way to go and we tended to stick to those kinds of places.   This was a great buffet! As we were escorted to our table, we walked past the different food stations and I was eying what I would be getting first. We sat down and everyone spread out like flies. It was like every kind of ethnic food was present. It was funny because once I sat down with my goodies, I looked at everyone else's plate and realized how I missed other good stuff! Needless to say, we all ate a lot and were there for an unhealthy amount of time.   We did sit next to this adorable couple from California who was celebrating their wedding anniversary. We ended up chatting the entire meal together and practically became best friends. It was a great way to start our Vegas vacation!",

Food does not even look appetizing, especially crab legs and meat. Dessert choices are non existent - most of them are just cupcakes.  And they taste awful. Stale cupcakes in an upscale buffet - someone from management needs to pay them a visit.  They used to have fresh made crepes, flambe them with liquor, add fresh fruit. Now there is a premade stack of crepes, they put some canned peaches and whipped cream and there you go!  No thanks.",

Even the dishes that looked good weren't that great.  My favorites were probably the stuffed tomato thing from the Mediterranean station and the cocktail shrimp which were very fresh and I loved that they were peeled already.  Their desserts were decent though...the flan, fruit tart, chocolate mousse thing and baklava were all pretty good.  Plus, they even have cotton candy which is fun!

    "text": "Wow...just checked again to see if we really did read such good reviews and they are still there. We must have gone on a really bad day. I will list the reasons for the 1 star and why I would NEVER recommend this place:   1. waited in a long line. not surprising considering we are in a vacation mecca BUT there were more used empty tables than ones being used by patrons.   2. we were surrounded by said dirty tables the entire time we were there.  3. our server greeted us by telling us we were going to be angry...why? because they only had tea and lemonade available, no soda. not a problem for me, I prefer tea...asked if it was fresh brewed, not, it was a mix. now yes, I was miffed. then angry when I tried it...pure disgusting swill.   3. we arrived around noon. I walked around looking before choosing. Looked at the soups. They still had oatmeal. From breakfast. Just gross.  4. food was just ok. really no better than your average, inexpensive buffet. the desserts looked fabulous, both pics and live...they were just thawed out items like you have in a chinese buffet. nothing special at all and certainly not worth the calorie splurge.  5. my calorie splurge was going to be the cotton candy...I am like a 5 yo with that stuff...Love, Love, Love it...they did not have it. Was told they did not have the sugar.   6. Table service was almost non-existent.  7. I really think most of these issues were due to being way understaffed...both table wise and cooking wise. So many items were obviously not being replenished and kept fresh. I overheard a patron asking asking the hostess (whom she had to get up and approach) when their drink order would be taken because they had been there quite awhile.   8. I honestly think that because we were on vacation, I was going to overlook all of this and try to think back on this as not too horrible. Until I went to a downtown buffet that I will review here as well. That cost less than half of what we paid here and was one thousand times better. Just unbelievable.",

We got there at 6 pm on a Saturday in the middle of March.  There was no line, and we waited 5 minutes for a table after them scanning our Buffet of Buffets pass.  Note that at 7 pm, we saw the line filled with people all the way back to the escalator.  So if you're gonna eat here, get there early.  The food wasn't spectacular.  It was just average, though fairly fresh.  My favorite was probably just the desserts.  They had chocolate covered strawberries and cotton candy.  The kids were all over the cotton candy.  It's the only buffet I've seen so far with cotton candy.  The chocolate covered strawberries were huge, but covered in chocolate that normally covers dipped ice cream cones.  It wasn't dipped in pure quality chocolate like I hoped, but was good nonetheless.  I say get those as soon as you see them, since they go quickly.  Honestly, nothing else stood out to me, which was kinda sad. They did have warm crab legs, though it seems like all they did was heat up the cold ones rather than pull them out fresh and steamed.",

Why did we come here then?  only b/c we bought the buffet of buffets, and this was one of the buffets on the card.  One great thing about this buffet was that there was no wait!  so if you are almost done with your 24 hours on the card, but you still feel like trying another buffet, this would be the one to try!  Lot of food selection, and it is clean. dessert section wasn't too great, just mostly cupcakes.",

    "text": "We had a Groupon for 2 with beer/wine included. Came here years ago and enjoyed it. Now that we live here with the deal we decided to try it out for Sunday brunch. This was nothing short of a disaster. There was no line at 11:30am. Our server mumbled under her breath about no one telling her she had customers. She was very loud and abrasive. Their beer and wine choices are the basic bottom shelf. They have many stations, however there are only a few items at each one, except the dessert station. The dishwasher was not working well that day, the first plate I picked up had pancakes and gravy from the plate below (full portions), not an appetizing way to start. The salad section just had so few selections, it was not manned. The Indian station was not manned either, 3 vegetarian entrees and tandoori chicken chunks. Asian was a bit better, not manned. The meat carving station....both beef hunks were cooked to death, no life...ugh! There was an attendant. The Italian and Mexican were both weak with no imagination, just blah selections. Desserts - this was very disappointing. It was mostly bready type things. Many of the prettier desserts were a base of dense pound/sponge cake and then decorated differently. These were not fresh, however there was an attendant who was refreshing items and was able to answer a question. They did have cheesecake, creme brulee and flan which were ok. They did have smoothies on one of the salad bars. Just really really disappointing food. Back to our server. She or no one else cleared our plates during our entire meal, so they stacked up. I met her when I was in line for dessert and asked her for another silverware service and napkin. She complained that she had to go in several directions to get these, but she would TRY....WHAT?? They are all bundled together. My husband just went to the hostess station to get it. We heard her announce that she was off the floor and still had not visited to ask us anything or clear plates, but she was attending other tables in our section. Another server came by to clear plates. After our server left (for a break??) and came back with a different shirt on, she delivered the silverware and napkin I had asked for 20 minutes prior and made some excuse that it was just such an effort to get it. She then noticed that my wine glass was still full and spent 5 minutes trying to convince me to get something else, when I clearly stated no, I was fine. We thought oh no, this is part of the Ceasars total buffet package now and maybe these casinos are just not interested in keeping standards because they have turned them into lower quality troughs....buffets have their reputation, but not so long ago they used to do a really nice job, especially for brunch. This one is just so pitiful, we will never return and will not recommend it to anyone, even with a deal.",

If you have a Platinum, Diamond, or Seven Stars Card Total Rewards Card, you can line up to a shorter line for faster service. Can't really say too much about it except that the best thing about the food is the variety of foods you can select from. Beware of the long lines during dinner time. Every time we walked by the buffet at dinner, there seems to be a very long line.",

For $34.99 you can experience the Spice Market Buffet four 24 hours as part of the Buffet of Buffets promotion through Harrah's Casinos.  The new promotion isn't the only deal out there as Planet Hollywood and Ebay have a ton of $5 off coupons.  I've eaten here about four times and my favorite parts are the seafood station with sushi, the mexican station, the italian station with pizza and the mexican station.  Food aside, the service is good, the place is clean and the atmosphere was good. It was even better the last time I went for lunch - all of the miss America contestants were there.

    "text": "My group and I visited the buffet in December 2008 for dinner. We were in line for a good hour before being taken down to the buffet via an escalator to wait another half hour. I thought the food must be outstanding to wait this long. The average price per person paid was $30, which I thought was reasonable for a Vegas buffet dinner.   Food galore! There were may food stations for different types of cuisines from all over the world--Asian (I loved the dim sum items!), Mexican, American, Indian...the selection was pretty sweet. The dessert station was pretty crowded most of the time because the made-to-order-crepes were a hit. I wasn't able to get a crepe for myself, but there were many other desserts lying around that I got to sample, like cheesecakes, chocolate cakes, brownies, etc. They were pretty good, nothing spectacular--just your garden-variety dessert you can get anywhere in a decent restaurant. The prime rib was juicy and big, but nothing fantastic. The salad bar was pretty decent as well, and the king crab legs were really good, too.   Service was friendly, and our drinks were refilled on a timely matter. The ambiance of the dining rooms felt casual and homely, and the tables were spaced out well so as to avoid elbowing other people from another table. I felt comfortable.   Overall, the buffet was pleasantly decent for the money. I stuffed myself silly. I had five full plates of food! The food wasn't something you'd get from a place with a Michelin award. It's yummy food to fill your empty stomachs with. I'm pretty sure anyone will walk out of the buffet feeling satisfied with good food for a good value.",

One of my brothers even suggested leaving while we were all on our first(and I think only) plate and going back to Paris or Harrah's. We came here for brunch on Sunday. In addition to them not being satisfied with how slowly the champagne was flowing, they all mentioned how nasty the bacon was, and we were all less than amused with the selection and variety of this place. The corned beef hash was VERY salty and I did not enjoy the smoked salmon, but the chorizo & eggs were good as were the breakfast potatoes. I was also somewhat annoyed that the signs did not match what they were in front of, but maybe that was because they were changing from breakfast to brunch. My first plate was OK, but I had no desire to go back for a second, until I saw the dessert. They had a HUGE selection of interesting flavors of cupcakes. I had a candy apple one, a key lime one, and two other unique flavors. They were really good, but not good enough to lure me back here, even with the buffet of buffets pass. Do NOT go here, as there are far better options.",

Tons of tables were free, but the staff was so lacking that they couldn't even clear off the tables for the hours of lines. I really should have paid more attention to the reviews on here.

No, we say, so she tells us to get to the back of the line... What line? There was no one else waiting. We walk around the roped off area and just like you see on T.V. She yells \"next!\" and has us walking back to her... Hmm?  Service from the wait-staff was fantastic, our drinks were filled quickly and plates were taken away fast too.  That's a good thing because we had a lot of plates; looking for one good thing to eat.  Crab legs were small, shrimp had no flavor, entire middle eastern line-up sucked (my favorite type of food) and the prime rib had nothing to bring home about. Only thing I liked was the dessert at the end of the meal. Banana cream pie and creme brulee were the standouts here.  I left here full, but it was a dissatisfied kind of full where I felt like I was forced to eat my share of a buffet meal. I will not be returning even if I were offered a free meal... Well, unless they paid for flight and boarding, then I would think about it.",

We opted for champagne & glasses were kept full. The space is large but cozy with no overpowering lighting & the food selections are amazing. I wish we could have sampled more but it is wise not to overindulge at a buffet though this one is surely tempting. The selection of pre split crab clusters both hot & cold is a highlight. I prefer the cold as the heated can be a little dry. However if you like it hot the Asian section has some spicy hot crab (not pre-split) that is out of this world. Another highlight is the shrimp tempura which is done just right & delicious. Desserts excellent as well if you have room but maybe addition of some premium ice cream or gellato would be a plus. Generally do not like background music but the version here is less annoying than usual. Highly recommended",

    "text": "Vacationing in Las Vegas can be pricey so I decided to use groupon for the all you can eat buffet at spice market at planet hollywood..     Breaking it down like this (wasn't a picture worthy buffet) they have food from all over the world but it you want variety and flavor I guess you get what you pay for. 1. Salad bar didn't have a huge selection  2. Middle Eastern selection was pretty poor curry cauliflower was dry and took one bite and spit it out and I love Indian food. 3. American selection was pretty bland meatloaf with barbecue sauce. Who can screw up macaroni and cheese??? This buffet did.  4.  Seafood if you are loving seafood this would be a great place for all you can eat crab legs so I asked asked our waitress if we could have a fresh hot batch and she brought us one (told us that she thought we had to be a black card member) but we aren't and she brought us one anyway. So not sure if that's True. 5. Unlimited drinks beer wine or champagne. Unless you drink a lot this might be a great add on to the buffet but if not and you have to go to a buffet get a groupon so that you can save a few dollars. 35 dollars for 2 with unlimited drinks.     Wouldn't recommend when you can go across the street to bellagio and taste and quality of food is actually worth what you paid.",

It had the best variety of cuisines and it was the most organized and layed out buffet and seating wise.  The food also seemed much fresher here, and the wait staff were so nice. We went during non peak times so lines were minimal and you'd think food wouldn't be fresh but it was!! I like that I was able to get my own drinks too.

An entire two stars off for their Italian section which was just confusing and tasted worse than Souplantation.

Several lamb dishes where great, however the leg of lamb was just not prepared well. The selection is excellent, but only some of the dishes on the buffet are truly good. Crab salad was phenomenal btw.  Don't expect this to be comparable to Wynn, Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace or Paris buffets, but it gives a solid rival to Monte Carlo and Mandalay Bay.

I came for the lunch buffet total spend about 50 dollars , but it included a somewhat diverse menu and drink menu. The menu is set up in a way that's separated by classification/ type of food. You had Italian , American , Asian , Mexican and one more I can't remember. The good itself wasn't to bad some things did need a bit more seasoning but not something to go crazy about. The staff did keep and eye on the cleanliness of the actual stations which is great some buffets don't care much about that. But overall not a bad experience just a bit pricy.",

We walked in the 106 degree heat to get there only for them to say only half was open.  When we said we had just called she said oh well this is all we have.  No apologies or anything.  Very rude.  We were hot and hungry so decided to stay.  Food was not worth it!   We may have been a bit biased since we were already irritated but the choices were extremely small.  Not worth it!",

The coffee station was on the opposite end of the room which was incredibly inconvenient. I had to make two trips, one for my coffee and another for my meal because of where I was seated. There were no spoons at the coffee station and they hand you your utensils upon sitting and there was not one included with the set. I had to walk up and down until I saw spoons at the soup station. Then when I returned to my table, I realized it hadn't been washed properly. Coffee was burnt too. I'm terms of food, I had scrambled eggs, home fries and one slice of French toast. The eggs were cold. Home fries were ok but not much flavor. The French toast was good but I was turned off by the woman behind the counter. I grabbed my French toast and right after she takes a wet (previously used) rag and wipes between the food dishes, touching the French toast! Finally, I reach the fruit station, only to find fruit that looked dry, as if it had been sitting out for hours. We arrived pretty early too so I cannot imagine what time the fruit had to have been put out. We will never dine here again. We were so disgusted by the food and presentation that we most definitely did not get our money's worth. We maybe ate half a plate each. Cafe Hollywood is right by it and you get much more for your money.",

    "text": "First, check the half-price ticket booths for discount admission. It was 30% off both nights that I went. Also, Viator occasionally has discounts for the buffet that can be purchased well in advance.  The main reasons I ate here twice were the crab legs and peel-and-eat shrimp. The crab legs are already perfectly cracked for you!! All you need to do is put them on a plate, carry them to your table, and pull the meat out. Wonderfully easy and very fresh. The shrimp are a bit more work but equally fresh and delicious.   Sections on the buffet include soups, salads, Mexican, Asian, Italian, seafood, American and Mediterranean. If you go before 8:45 pm, be prepared to wait. My only complaint is that they needed to have more cashiers working and should have also had at least one more hostess to seat people...only two stars for customer service. With the exception of the crab station, there were no lines for the food, only for the cashiers and the seating staff. Beverages are included but are not serve-yourself, so you're at the mercy of your waiter for the drinks.  Overall, this is a great value. Don't miss the made-to-order crepes on the dessert buffet, and grab a cone of cotton candy on your way out!",

I was excited to see pork manapua (steamed bun) and immediately disappointed by the poor job done in trimming the meat had had to pull several pieces of gristle from my mouth.   I had no drink, napkin, nor silverware for about five minutes.   The chips on the salsa bar were stale and there were rotting pieces of lettuce in the mixed greens salad.   The chicken in the Kung pao had the consistency of sawdust. The white rice was the star of the Asian bar.   The swirl ice cream cone was spot on - best part of the meal.   Do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere.",

I will have to say, with deep regret that the food isn't as good as it used to be. I don't know what happened. Since they went from being the Aladdin to Planet Hollywood, something changed, and it hurts me deep inside. Maybe because the people who own these places are more focused on catering to disgusting, sweaty pigs that frequent the club scene? \"Yay let's get trashed and get our makeup all smeared and let's go barefoot so our feet look like we've been walking through tar and then guys will all love us and marry us!\" I'm certain this is the mentality of these pigs.

I have no idea how long the cleaning staff must wait before they decide that diners are done if diners don't leave their napkins on top of their drinks, but this *may* be a contributing factor to the line backups.",

A buffet like this reminds you why you shouldn't be eating at buffets in the first place.  I'd rather spend twice as much on a meal that I'd actually enjoy.  There were plenty of times when I put something in my mouth and took it out before taking a bite.  I felt bad about wasting food but I'd feel even worse if I actually digested it.

There wasn't anything really outstanding or unusual like what you'd see at the Buffet at Bellagio but then again this one is half the price. There's a good selection of foods, all prepared decently well and enough turnover in the restaurant to ensure that you're not getting left with 2 hour old food like you see at some of the less frequented buffets.",

We were seated right next to the seafood section which was a plus for us since we love seafood. The service was not so great as far as I can remember. The server just seated us and served our drinks, then she was nowhere to be found after that. The food choices in my opinion was just okay, but service could have been better for my experience. What makes this place different from other buffets is the cotton candy, which my boyfriend made a grab for it. Wouldn't mind coming back, but I got other places to try out before coming back to this place!",

    "text": "Actually ate here twice but didn't pay full price for either.  Once we had a Groupon and the other time we had a free dinner for sitting through the time share presentation.  Even with the discount both times it was just okay.  I got full but can't really say that anything was outstanding.  The first night we were on our way to a show so had a limited amount of time. There was a very long line we had to wait through.  The salad area was just plain sad.  No real stuff to put in the salad.  Good cheese selection though and that was actually pretty tasty.  Yes, they have a lot of seafood.  Is it good?  Not really.  They claim to have crab legs, and they did, but they were cold.  There were no warm ones anywhere else.  Shrimp cocktail was pretty standard and all of the fish dishes were overcooked.  The turkey from the carving station was very good and so were the steamed asparagus and minestrone soup they had that night.  Good, got full, but nothing amazing.  The second time we had a bit more time to spend and this time no long line to wait.  We showed up about two hours before closing and while they were slow they continued to put fresh food out.  Nice.  At least the food is fresh.  This night our Groupon included all we could drink too.  We went with wine and the server brought fresh glasses when we were empty and towards the end of the night when she was getting ready to close down she just brought us a new bottle and left it on the table for us.  Also nice.  Still,, the food was only mediocre at best.  There was a crepe station and the desert crepes were really good.  They had a huge selection of toppings to choose from too.  I just piled on the fruit, chocolate syrup and whipped cream and had a fabulous desert.  There are better tasting buffets out there but there was a lot to choose from, the waitresses were nice and friendly, and it is conveniently located inside the Planet Hollywood casino.  Would I go back here if I was in Vegas again?  Probably not.",

I really didn't think its worth the 27.95 price for saturday lunch, which is the without champange price. I have eaten at the Rio buffet and they have Lobster, crab legs, bbq pork ribs, more sweets, more sushi, and is about the same price.

There were 11 in our party (6 came up so they started to seat us, then the remaining 5, she starting raising her voice telling me I should have told her there were 11, then started to argue with me), they wanted to charge 18% gratuity to serve the ice tea (she didn't take our plates away without us telling her, and she didn't serve the drinks without us tracking her down). We split the party up to prevent paying the 18% and they put us at opposite ends of the dining area.  Definitely won't go back there again, EVER.",

Well, long story short, it wasn't all that great and I was let down.  The crab legs were tiny and near impossible to eat, the lamb tasted like dirt, and the prime rib was dry.  So, off to another buffet.  Well, once my pass was about to expire, I decided to go back to Spice Market for convenience (since every other buffet I tried wasn't so special, either) and had a completely different experience that time.  Every thing was SO GOOD.  The prime rib was medium rare and juicy, the shrimp cocktail was awesome, and the tempura shrimp (my personal favorite from this restaurant) still has me lying awake at night thinking about it.  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the desert bar.  Everything tasted processed and from the frozen aisle of a Sam's Club.    I will definitely come back here.  More so for the tempura shrimp than anything.",

This magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different Harrah's properties. The price is $39.99 for Rewards Club members and $45.99 for non-members. It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.  Note: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.  The buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!  Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood-If you really want to feel as if you are in a hot, stuffy, crowded, spice market, this is the place for you. It is in the basement, so there are no windows and no doors. The line to pay is right in the center of the room and the quarters are mighty tight. There were alot of people in very little space with very little air flow and it was 111 degrees outside...use your imagination.  We hit this stop for brunch. The stations included salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, and \"mid-east.\" Yes, I swear it was labeled \"mid-east.\" At first I thought it was food from Indiana or Ohio, but I guess they meant \"Middle East\" wink, wink. There was a random selection of Greek and Indian food...surprise, Greece and India are now in the middle east! Oh, and there was hummus.  Overall, the space was dank and depressing. Win was that the champagne was cold and served in a flute. The bigger win was that we saved the life of a fellow diner who was choking with the Heimlich Maneuver. If you do not plan to drink or save a life this stop may be disappointing.",

The staff is very few making the service slow. The food= meh! I did not taste anything extraordinary.  the kitchen areas and carpet are dirty. I hope they will upgrade and make better and tastier  selections.",

They also didn't have as much of a selection. After this I think I'm done with buffets I'm over it lol.",

    "text": "I'm veeeeeeery picky when it comes to buffets...particularly Vegas buffets. My mind automatically raises the buffet-bar when I step off the plane and into Sin City. So with that said, The Spice Market Buffet at Plant Hollywood was ehh.  There's a decent amount of food that stretches along the entire back wall of the buffet. It was kinda inconvenient for a hungry hound like myself. I had to use my legs and feet to walk, yes WALK, from one end of the buffet to the other. But along the way I found some interesting items [during lunch] that peak my interest, some good and some not. I found it very interesting that they had a decent selection of Middle Eastern food. Not many buffets that I've had to opportunity to try never cover that part of the globe.  Overall, taste and quality of food was aight. I wasn't really impressed, but I mean it got the job done.  What I was impressed with was the desserts. They've got a crepe-making station that wasn't half bad. They've got a few different fruits to put in the crepes [strawberries, cherries, banana, etc.] and they'll even throw on some whipped cream and chocolate sauce if you're into that kinda thing. The only thing that irked me was that the fruit was drenched in a sugary syrup, or as the kids call it \"sizzzzurp.\"  Service was okay. Our server [are they still servers at buffets??] cleaned plates in a timely fashion, told us some stories and made some small talk.  I mean SMB was okay, don't get me wrong, but for the cost and quality of everything, I'm sure there are other buffets that would be a better bang for the buck [one in particular comes to mind]. But it's worth a whirl at least once.",

The eggs were no where near \"poached\"  Ok so besides that irritating me, I must say, this has been one of the worst buffets I've tried in Vegas. Save that $15. Go to the M Resort for $10 instead or try the Wynn for breakfast. They are so much better.  I must have came in on bad day. But it was Monday for breakfast and the employees took an incredibly long time to refill the stations....so long that when I left 30 minutes later, it still wasnt refilled. So there goes the pastry station for me. Everything else just seemed so \"watered down or over cooked\" Not worth my money. Will not be returning to this buffet or casino! Reviewing the casino next!",

I was kind of disappointed with the crab legs.  It's nice that they split them up, but it was sad that they don't have a lot of it.  They only have one tray in the seafood section and it goes by fast.    It's similar to other buffets where they have a variety of food from other countries.  They had a middle eastern food section that was pretty good.  The dessert section was paltry compared to Rio's Carnival.  The only thing good was the flan.    Overall, it's a deal with the 24 hour wristband, but the line is off the chain long. Expect to wait a good hour and a half on Sunday, just like we did.  The service was just not there.  Perhaps because he was super busy, I hope.  I suggest coming only if you have a wristband, if you have to pay full price, I don't think it would be a great idea.",

We got seated and went to get our food, the \"American\" section didn't have the classics like; burgers, dogs, mashed potatoes and good ribs! The \"Italian\" section didn't have any fettuccine Alfredo or lasagna, the \"Asian\" section was OK the chow mien and fried rice wasn't bad. The \"Mexican\" section was the worst part (Iam of Mexican and Guatemalan decent) and was ashamed of the selection and quality of this section. It was horrible, the rice was  under cooked and did not look appetizing, typical tacos and fajitas had a \"Mediterranean\" Section which I didn't bother trying and Also a \"Seafood\" section which I don't eat seafood so didn't bother either. The service was just as bad as the food, we had to wait almost 10 min into our meal to get our drinks and our waiter was acting like we were bothering him for things! I literally sat for 20 min with 2 dirty plates in front of me before he can to pick them up and getting refills was like pulling teeth. But he was all smile and fast with a party of almost 18 people that had been seated a few feet away from us! I will never go back to this buffet again and would never recommend this buffet to anyone!!!",

I like that the food is separated into categories: seafood, asian, salad, soups, american, mexican, mid-eastern, etc. The food is pretty delicious and the seafood selection is pretty good. The lines are kinda long, but it's pretty worth it. The seating area can be a little confusing to some people, as my dad got lost and sat at the wrong table. My mom had to go find him and bring him back to our table haha. Also, if you have t-mobile as a cell phone service. You may have trouble getting reception. Me and my family did not get any reception down there.. so yeah, beware. Other than that, the food is good! If you haven't tried it, or are thinking about it. You definitely should :)",

    "text": "I was thoroughly not impressed! first of, the sunday brunch price was $28.99 with tax came out to $31. It's a champagne brunch with all you can drink. While standing in the long line granted it was during the peak brunch time at around noonish, I could see the extensive choices. There's selection, like an American station, Mexican station, Middle Eastern (this includes Indian, weird!), Asian, Italian (apparently pancakes and french toast are Italian), a breakfast station, a dessert station, a seafood station and two salad stations. As I said, it's extensive. So, I was hungry, my belly was growling and I remember seeing someone eating a cotton candy as they were leaving Spice Market so I was intrigued by this. Anywho, stood in line, paid, stood in line yet again and my party of five was eventually seated after a half hour wait. So we gave our drink orders, and a friend and I took our turn to get our food. Of course I was excited, I saw on the screens while we were waiting that was chicken curry at the Middle Eastern station so I knew I had to get some. Grabbed two plates and started with an Eggs benedict, BACON, got some chicken curry, tandoori chicken, some steamed rice, a steamed pork bun (yea i was getting my feast on) and proceeded back to the table to get crunk with my food. Sadly that was not to be, the chicken curry was salty and lacked flavor (what happened to spice? huh Spice Market?!), the tandoori chicken was rubbery and so lackluster, it felt limp in my mouth =( , the steamed rice was not that soft (like how do you mess that up?!), the Eggs Benedict egg was not runny but COOKED through, seriously?!! The only two things that were satisfactory was the bacon and the pork bun. So I thought maybe it's a fluke? I must have chose the wrong food items, so back I went to the buffet and this time, I got a blueberry and cherry crepe, a slice of french toast, some fruit (cantaloupe and pineapple) and a fruit cobbler. the crepe was meh I've had way better, the french toast was limp and blah, the fruit not sweet and the fruit cobbler was generic. The $31 was money wasted, I might have been full from sampling everything but I was not satisfied, rather I felt cheated. In my opinion for the money you spend, the same price could be better spent at other brunch buffets elsewhere on the strip like Mandalay Bay, the Rio or Stratosphere. I'm not a big buffet person but this buffet is a no-go in the future.",

I have never written such a negative review in my life, but we were so unhappy there that we even took photos of our unhappiness.  We even skipped dessert.  I am sorry, but it was really bad.",

And it was expensive compared to a better buffet that we ate in Paris Las Vegas Hotel. My friends and I ended up eating lots of shrimp and champange in order to get our money worth spending.",

They've got the best selection in food, service is quick, and the wait isn't too bad. The price without the bracelet is a value also, especially if you find one of those $5 off coupons that are laying everywhere. I'd go back and have gone back a few times.",

The prime rib was actually cold when I ate it and the atmosphere wasn't that great either, which made me think that I could have gotten a better deal at the Rio buffet (which has better food and about the same decor) or the Palms buffet (which is about the same, but much cheaper).  I don't think I would recommend this place to my friends.",

    "text": "While staying at the Aladdin/Planet Hollywood I read in reviews that this buffet was at least top10 in Vegas. So I had to check it out..not to mention it was easy to get to.  I had breakfast there friday morning, and dinner there saturday night.    Price: Breakfast $15 per person, Dinner $25 per person. Not on the cheap side, but still fair. Especially for the quality of food.   Wait:  Breakfast we showed up at 10:00 am, 2-3 people ahead of us in line, quickly seated.  Dinner, about 6 people ahead of us, the cashier took no time to get to, but getting a table for 6 took a little while, and was slightly annoying (probably about 10-15 mins)....probably would've been easier if there wasn't some wedding banquet going on on the other side of the restaurant. We ended up doing the..lets' just stand next to the table of 6 grannies not eating and chatting..and talk real loud about how hungry we are and how we wish we had  a table that could hold six people..I think they got the hint and left quickly.    Food Quality - Breakfast was good with many options, the omlet station line was a little long so I passed on it. but everything else was good..besides...how bad does a buffet got to be to screw up scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns, chicken fried steak?  Dinner - was awesome. The different stations for different cuisine was good too.  The middle east kabobs were very good..i liked the lamb a lot, but the Chicken was kind've weird (marinated in chasu sauce which is chinese and reserved for pork).  Mexican looked like your standard Taco bar...I passed. The roast beef was very good, potato bar had some nice options. Asian cuisine had terrible egg rolls (as expected), but the tempura shrimp was good (too bad no dipping sauce). the quality of sushi was very good though..so I grabbed a lot..(*tip*..eat the raw fish as sashimi only..screw the rice)..salmon, tuna, eel...Wanna-be Sushi conossiuers would you prefer me to use the japanese names?!?  Okay fine...meji, sake, and unagi. i took 4 years of japanese but it's horrible..hahah..   Anyway, the italian station was very good as well...as they had a variety of different pastas..the lobster pasta was quite tasty, and the cheese raviolis as well..The pizza looked good too, but i passed as..I did not spend $25 to eat pizza. Lastly the seafood..which mainly composed of Oysters and Alaskan King crab was good..I did not try the oysters (i try only to eat premium oysters for fear of food poisoning)...but the alaskan king crab legs were great and plentiful..of course a line for that, but not too bad...once you got past the little old ladies who always stakced 20 legs on their plate...just do your part as well. The soups were good as well...I had a creamy Tomato Basil soup..nice.    Service - we were never left with empty glasses, plates cleared quickly. it was sad to see one server clear a table for six people all by herself. we left her a good tip, she was a friendly server and  a hard worker.  and was very on top of always keeping our drinks filled.  overall -  I highly recommend Spice Market Buffer, the prices are fair, the food quality is very good, and the amount of variety is good as well. I'll be there for lunch next time in Vegas as i was craving some Clam Chowder I saw being prepared for lunch while i was there for breakfast. ~G",

I would agree, it was pretty good for a buffet (I'm not a typical buffet person, being vegetarian it's usually not worth it for me).  Definately one of the best I've been to and certainly the biggest I've ever seen!  First I was told to get the coupon from those little books, they run a buy one get one free, so that helps with the cost.  Line to get in is so long, but moves pretty fast.    The place is comprised to stations of so many nationalities, it was overwhelming!  Mexican, Indian, Chinese, American, Italian, Dessert, etc.  Food was hit or miss...  flaffel and hummus was terrible as was most of the Mexican station.  Italian was so-so.  Indian and American was pretty good and dessert had lots of yummy things including ice cream.  If you have to do a buffet, do this one!",

    "text": "I hate buffets.  When my group on my last Vegas trip made me leave my poker game at the Flamingo and then told me that we were going to the Planet Hollywood buffet for lunch, I was not too happy.  When I found myself standing in line in the casino, I was prepared to be mad and bitter about my food.  Boy was I surprised - the lunch buffet there was exceptional.    Particularly good was their \"American\" cuisine section.  I know, that sounds kind of lame, considering they advertise themselves as \"Spice Market\".  But the beef roast was great (I normally hate generic beef roasts for the masses - they are always bland, overcooked, and just disappointing - not this one), the breaded pork chop was something that True Southerners could be happy with, and they even had a made-to-order hamburger service. They also had Italian, Asian, Seafood, and Middle Eastern food as well, all of which had good dishes.  To top it off, the made to order crepes for dessert were fantastic.  Obviously not everything was exactly what I would have wanted - it is a buffet cooked for thousands of people, after all.  But far more of that food had me thinking \"I should go back for some more\" than at any other buffet I have been to... ever.  Other Vegas buffet's don't stack up to it, especially when cost is considered (and I've been to Bellagio, Rio, among others).  Also, unlike most every other buffet I've been to in Vegas, the waitress was friendly and helpful.  Compared to all buffets, this one earns 5 stars.",

    "text": "Was very pleasantly surprised by this place and may be my new fave brunch buffet in Vegas now - even better than the renowned Bellagio buffet.  Decided to try this place because it was conveniently located since we were staying in the Planet Hollywood Casino (formerly Aladdin Casino) and they gave guests a $5 coupon off per person to encourage ppl to try it. Was highly doubtful of the quality and selection of the food even though it was voted \"Best Vegas Buffet\" by what sounded like some bogus Vegas magazine. However, we were very impressed and satisfied by the huge selection (even more than Bellagio buffet) and the quality and taste of the food (on par if not better than the Bellagio buffet).  The Spice Market restaurant does not look as elegant as the Bellagio Buffet, but it was much bigger with so many more food stations. Offerings included: - Breakfast - fresh waffles and fresh omelettes made-to-order were awesome - Asian - the chinese pork buns were so soft and fantastic, sushi, etc. - Bakery - so many breads and pastries, including focaccia etc - Middle Eastern - this was very different and had things like tandoori chicken, hummus, etc. - American - standard comfort foods - Italian - included lobster pasta - Seafood - salmon, seafood and chicken paella, etc. - Desserts - soft-serve ice cream CUSTARD was so creamy and delicious, freshly made cotton candy, and a zillion other desserts that looked so good. Even more desserts than Bellagio. - Salads - many different options - Carving - prime rib, lamb, many others - Mexican - meats, sides, condiments to make your own fajitas/tacos but the meats were hard from sitting in the heat too long  Hint: find a $5 per person discount coupon somewhere. The Planet Hollywood casino front desk may be able to provide one if you are not staying there.  Bottom line: Food here was suprisingly good for a buffet and much better and cheaper than the Bellagio buffet. And there was a very short line - forget the long line at Bellagio and give this place a try. You mught come out very pleasantly surprised like we were.",

I'm actually susprised that they even have the nerve to bring out something of that quality at a vegas buffet for 30 bucks a person. the sushi had 5 times more rice than fish was hard and dense.    The mexican food was good, but again quality was a litte lacking as I was overhearing others saying the same thing at other tables.   The deserts were ok . Again, nothing spectacular.",

Mexican quasidillas are very tasty 4. Chinese vegetarian rolls were good too .. 5. And last but NEVER the least, the desserts are a must have.

Dessert area has a variety of cakes, pies, and soft serve ice cream. They also have a crepe maker was very good.  What KO's all the elegant buffets I have been to like the Wynn and Bellagio is the price. $20 comparing to $35-40 at the other hotels for dinner is unbeatable especially for the similar dining selections. I guess if you are there for the ambiance and elegance like the Wynn or Bellagio then you should go there.

The Sunday champagne brunch was a great deal, lots of champange freely flowing throughout the meal.  Fast forward to today and the Spice Market Buffet is a shadow of its former self. Less food choices and what they do offer is of a quality that you would find at say a Denny's or IHOP. Weekday lunch was $20.00pp and it was truly one of the worst meals I have ever eaten.

They had carne asada and shrimp for the meats and all the other stuff you would put in a taco. Everything was very fresh and the tortillas were nice and hot. I was able to try every section except Middle Eastern because I got too excited and ate too fast and plus I'm not really a big fan. If you like Crepes/omelettes/toast/sausage and other breakfast like foods this is the place for you.  Anyway like Steven said I would recommend you get the $3 unlimited champagne for your momosas.

However, I found the food was quite bland-garlic bread was flavorless,pizza was too. The cauliflower from the mid-eastern section was meh, and so were the grilled veggies.   The salad bar was okay, as were the bread and cheese selections they had. The tandoori chicken and the hammus were tasty. The oval rasberry cheesecakes were excellent.    The Mac and cheese lacked flavor, and cheese. Maybe I came on a bad day? Or I chose the wrong foods. This place probably just isn't for me.",

There was nothing to write home about the selection. I had some meat and mashed potatoes that looked safe enough. Both were bland. My husband had some Mediterranean chicken and vegetables. When I opted to look around for something else, I decided on a Caesar salad. Should be safe? But one expensive salad. There were some chili hot dogs just sitting out - not even covered and the chili had solidified. This was disgusting. My husband had skipped going for anymore food as nothing was appealing and went for dessert. He had a mini eclair that he actually spit out- it was not baked through. Mind you my husband was in the army for 12 years - basically will eat anything, but this is where he drew the line! That should explain how bad it was. I asked to speak to the manager-Adam. I showed him my husband's uncooked eclair - he didn't say a word!!! I then walked him over to the chili dogs and asked him, did he think it was safe? He just looked at me. I then asked him to take a bite of one - his immediate response was \"I can give you a refund.\" - enough said!",

The food was fine for what I was looking for - something to line my stomach for the night ahead! I had the salad bar, a bunch of grilled vegetables, Mac & cheese, hummus/pita, spring rolls, and a few cookies on the way out. It wasn't the best food in Vegas but it was good enough and exactly what I was looking for for the price ($40 will get you 2 drinks in Vegas outside of a buffet). My waiter was a DELIGHT! I told him I was going to a show so he could keep the drinks coming. He brought me two at a time, and when I said I was ready to go he offered me several to go options . He was so sweet and accommodating. To sum it up - I wouldn't go out if my way to go here, but if you're in Vegas solo and looking for a pre-show dinner at Zappos, this is a great option!!",

I was surprised that at this price, they still served the snow crab legs and had a great variety of food.  A few dishes I particularly enjoyed was stuffed sole, ribs, prime rib, shrimp pasta, and the cupcakes.  They also serve cotton candy which was neat.  Location is inside Planet Hollywood which was a convenient distance from our hotel Paris.  Interior is nothing fancy but the booth seat was comfortable.  We went around 6:30 and was seated right away, though shortly after they had a short line up.    Service is ok, plates get cleared at a decent speed.  The soft drinks, tea and coffee is all selve serve.  Would recommend with Groupon but not as sure if paying regular price as this buffet isn't as luxurious looking as its pricier counterparts.",

It was what I expected, your typical American buffet with subpar quality and limited options. It didn't have any crab legs if anybody was wondering. Most of the items weren't bad but not what you'd expect from a Las Vegas buffet. Nothing was stood out at particularly good. Unless you're very hungry and not willing to wait in line, you should avoid this place. I agree with another earlier post that I definitely wouldn't pay full price. The other buffets offer similar things and give you better options.",

I've never been a big fan of any kind of buffets but I'm a little easier to convince when it's breakfast because I know with my limited willingness to explore these self-serve smorgasbords I can always default to the omelette station and grab some fresh fruit while my partners indulge in plate after plate of culinary carbohydrates consTrued to feed the masses and still allow the proprietors to turn a profit.  I am proud to say that I stuck to my plan only indulging a little by adding a few strips of bacon, but I must admit I was tempted by a few of the many varieties of cultural offering on display. After dropping $66.00 plus a tip for the 3 of us you don't need to be a mathematical wizard to realize this is Vegas and they never lose no matter what the game is and the breakfast buffet is no exception.   I was very happy with my fresh made omelette and my associates seemed quite please after their third trip or so. As far as buffets go I must say I was quite impressed and if the lunch and dinner offerings equal or exceed the breakfast selections I can see how they remain a popular choice amongst the tourist whether it's really the value most seem to think it is, I guess if you're happy the house is happy and everyone is somewhat a winner.",

    "text": "In Planet Hollywood an Academy Award scene is enjoying the Spice Market Buffet. They say that variety is the Spice of life. And the Spice Market Buffet is a culinary walk of fame with cuisine stars represented in nine food stations: seafood, two salad bars, soup, dessert, Mid Eastern, Italian, American, Asian, and Mexican.    Asian Foods:  The foods represented included spicy drunken noodles, Kung Pae chicken, miso soup, honey nut chicken, tilapia, fried rice,  and spring rolls. I really enjoyed the spicy drunken noodles and miso soup. The spicy drunken noodles remind me of chow fun. The miso soup was tasty and served in larger bowls than at Courtyard Buffet. I would of appreciated it if they had wonton soup. It seems that that Cravings Buffet is the only buffet on the Strip serving wonton soup.    Soup: I was filling up on soup. So I passed over the chicken noodle and tortilla soup.   Mexican: There was a decent selection of Mexican food. The foods represented included Mexican corn, Spanish rice, Charro beans, Chile cheese, quesadilla, grilled chicken, and fajitas.   American : This station seemed to have the longest line. This makes sense because it appeared to be the only live station. They cooked turkey and prime rib that the chefs cut and placed on your plate. Near the meat was rice pilaf, ribs, mash potatoes, and BBQ spice chicken. The Asian and seafood stations were filling me up and I passed over the fresh cut prime rib and turkey.   Seafood: This is the Spice Market Buffet station that is worthy of an Oscar. There was far more seafood than the so-called Station buffets that double the price and make a steak and shrimp gimmick on a popular night that people go out. This got the most action on my plate. The seafood represented included sushi, seafood paella, shrimp scampi pasta, stuffed sole, snow crabs, Cajun crawfish pasta, and peel eat shrimp. This seafood station is my minimal expectation of a seafood buffet.   Mid Eastern: The neat thing about buffets is they bring out the adventurous eater. What is the worst thing that could happen if you try something and you dislike it? I was adventurous when I went to the Mid Eastern station. What should I try? There was chicken curry, couscous salad, lamb, Taboull,  hummus, and kabobs. I'd try the couscous salad and hummus. I'm glad I got to try it because now I know that I don't care for Mid Eastern food.   Italian food: If there was eggplant parmesain or veal parmesain, I would of filled up less in the seafood station. I was not crazy over the selection. They had pizza, pasta, meatballs, and some other food.   REPORT OF MY 11/01/2015 VISIT:     If you sign up for a Harrah's credit card, they reward you with two complimentary buffets. My brother took advantage of this deal. He invited me along for the zero cents buffet. Around 5 pm on a Sunday we met up there. We saved over $29 each. And we saved on time.  There was no line. And there was zero waiting on the server to ask you what to drink. Upon paying for the buffet, you order the beverage that the server brings to the table. In lieu of waiting for the server, I made a beeline for the food stations. I'd mostly full up on Asian foods and seafood to the point that I passed over dessert. Throughout the dinner, the server occasionally checked up on us and never rushed us.      The Spice Market Buffet was an Academy Award Winning scene in the basement of Planet Hollywood. However it falls short of being an Academy Award Buffet. In my opinion it falls in the middle of Las Vegas Strip buffets. In Yelp ratings, the middle is 3 stars.",

Food from a variety of cuisines, but I only felt I could eat Italian and Mexican. Italian was a variety of pastas, and Mexican I had a plate of nachos. The salad bar wasn't as extensive as I was hoping, but they had a great cheese platter! I wish the salad bar had a few premixed salads for ease. I had a few items from the dessert bar, most of them were dry.

He was always checking in and refilling our drinks, which was great because the living social deal we had came with bottomless beer/wine/champagne and our waiter was not being stingy with the booze.

    "text": "We were in Vegas for two nights and came here on our first night. I found us a deal for $39 that included the buffet for 2 and unlimited beer, wine, and champagne too! That's less than $20 a person- not bad for Vegas! I read from other reviewers that the Mediterranean section of the buffet was the best so that's where I went. After salad and bread (tasty but cold) of course. I had the couscous salad and the tabouli and both were delicious and flavorful. Highly recommended. Fiance is more of an American food kinda guy so he had some pizza and some sliders. He wasn't that impressed with his food but thought it was fine for the buffet. I would recommend staying away from the bland American selections and visiting the Mediterranean table. We each enjoyed two glasses of champagne during the meal and then sat around for an hour talking and taking our time before desert. The place was busy but not too busy so that we felt rushed. After an hour, we each ordered a glass of red wine to have with dessert and went to check out the desert selections. They had a beautiful assortment of cupcakes which were one of the highlights of my experience here. They also had creme brulee which I found to be delicious and not too sweet. Fiance had some cupcakes and enjoyed them. We spent about two hours here and had a great time. We could have lingered and enjoyed more unlimited drinks but it was very hot in Vegas and three drinks over two hours is more than enough. Don't wanna overdo it in the heat. I would say this place is a 3.5 for food 4 for service (waitress was very nice- make sure to tip a dollar for each drink you get at least!) and a 5 for value. We got the deal on TravelZoo if you want to check it out.",

It was not like the Rio but I was not trying to pay $50.00 bucks and stand in line for a couple of hours. It was Veterans day so I got a little lucky and was in about 30 minutes   I was tired and starving, so the food was good to me. I had my waffles and bacon and grits and a few other items and I was on my way. I will have to try them again at lunch or dinner so the review will not be a little biased. I say this because I had a major hangover:)",

There were two options to get into the buffet: wait in line and pay the normal price (which I did and ended up waiting for nearly an hour), or pay the express line price. Those who paid the express line price got to zip through the line, but they got the same food for a lot more money. I didn't think it was worth it.   The food itself was good, and this buffet had lots of options. However, the service was abysmal. You have to write your drink order on a card instead of telling the waitress. We didn't know that, and we waited a while for the waitress to arrive. Once she did, we didn't have our card ready so she just left. I ended up not getting my drink until I had finished my first plate. That sucked. Plus, we never got refills. This place was definitely NOT worth the cost.",

At the start of my meal, there was a broken piece of glass in my food, which I didn't realize until it was in my mouth and I was about to swallow it. I kindly pointed it out to the service staff - who were very gracious in accommodating me and apologized. After realizing the glass was there, I just lost my appetite for the rest of the meal.  I don't demand free stuff much or am one of those people that cause a scene to get a free meal, but I did hope that the broken glass in my food (and in my mouth) would get me a refund on my meal. Unfortunately that was not offered. :-P Because of that incident I don't think I can bring myself to go back there again.",

We just wanted to come in to see them and maybe order a drink seeing as how we had already eaten, but they made us pay $74 for 2 people just to come in.  Like, literally harassed us for standing in their entry and said we had to pay to be there.  We tried to eat a little something since we had paid so much to be there, but everything was flavorless and not worth the effort.  The waitress also harassed the group every time someone ordered a drinks demanding to see our receipts.  Get a grip, you're an overpriced, mediocre at best buffet and we were all more than paid for.

Awesome selection of different type of food from around the world. The quality of the food was top notch.  The food looked delicious. Everything I put in my mouth was YUMMY.   I dont really have a big stomach these days, but coming here, I really wish that I did! I want to EAT EVERYTHING HERE!  Bonus: Get the rewards card and buy your 24 hour buffet pass for about $43 something including tax! You can go to this buffet as well as other ones around the area like the World buffet at Rio(but why would you go anywhere else, I just said this place was the best).",

On a positive note the line moved very fast and we waited for less than 10 minutes.  If you have the buffet of buffet pass save yourself the stomach space and go to the Paris buffet instead.",

Short line means we can eat quicker!\" think not.  As the line moved within 15 minutes upstairs, you get invited downstairs then we see the other giant line that we were not prepared for. So it was our fault for seeing the mirage upstairs. The new one was about 35 minutes until we were seated.  Food choices were pretty good and plentiful. Since I have only been to less than a handful of buffets in Vegas, I really did like the different sections from around the world. My favorite was the Mid-East section with all the juicy meat selections. The meat both lamb and beef were juicy but a tad rough on some pieces.   I'm down to come back here next time.",

The food was decent but not fresh. The best was the salmon and bow tie noodles. I did enjoy dessert the crepe chef was polite friendly and was honestly the only part I enjoyed of the establishment.

    "text": "This so-called buffet is located downstairs in the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino.  There was a long line, but the wait was only about 10-12 minutes. Ended up paying $27.99 since I had my player's card, but my friend ended up paying $30.00 since she didn't bring hers.  Anyway, I had a little bit of each cuisine, except the Mexican, since I accidentally spilled water all over it. Unfortunately, it would take me forever to nit-pick what was wrong with each dish, so I'm just going to be listing what I didn't like about each one here:  American:  Rag-out: mushrooms tasted like they were uncooked, sauce was flavorless Macaroni & cheese: it didn't taste like cheese, or pasta; plus the cheese was sort of clear(eww!)  Mediterraenean:  Naan with mango chutney: Okay. The mango was a little too sweet for my liking, but it wasn't terrible.  Seafood: king crab legs: these were going fast; not sure why though. They could have at least provided some melted butter so it wouldn't be so bland clams: tasted like mussels; though that's not necessarily a bad thing  Italian:  3 cheese lasagna: similar to the type of lasagna you'd get at Sbarro. A-ok.  I didn't have any of the salads, but my friends said they were good.   And now, for the desserts, which was the worst part of the meal:  Seafood: king crab legs: these were going fast;  clams: tasted like mussels; though that's not necessarily a bad thing  carrot cake: basically, they baked carrots into rye bread. flan: weird, because the sauce was good, but flan itself was like flavorless jello.  strawberry cheesecake: okay, so they decided not put any sugar in it. Oh, and they substituted some crumbly feta cheese for the cream cheese. Awful, just awful. creme brulee: the top wasn't even glazed over and crunchy; you're supposed to crack the top of a creme brulee to eat it. The inside tasted very eggy, and the texture was just like pudding. lemon meringue tart: Guess they decided to save money and just use the same filling for the creme brulee and the lemon meringues.   Hands down the worst dining experience I have ever had in my life. Though I didn't try much of the Mediterranean cuisine, my friends said that and the salads were the only tasty parts of their meal. The only thing I liked about eating here was that they had cotton candy.",

However the one redeeming feature they did have was that they can custom make crepes with a wide veriety of toppings.   Overall I wouldn't go here when there are so many better places to eat in Vegas and better buffets.",

She barked where we had to stand after paying for the buffet to be seated.  The food we mediocre at best.  The array of food was intriguing but the majority of the stations felt as if the food was there for a long time.  The fried rice and sliders had no taste.  Service was slow and agonizing while we waited to be served our drinks.  It felt to us as if the wait staff was severely understaffed.  There are much better buffet in Las Vegas and I highly recommend that you skip this one .  The Buffet at Ceasar's is outstanding .",

Other notable items they have:  Crab legs - already split in half for you and you can eat your money's worth here if you're a big crab person.   Prime rib - somewhat on the dry side   Wide selection of cupcakes - a person with a sweet tooth would love their selection of desserts  Kabobs - they have several and I tried the lamb kabob. Unfortunately, that was also dry.   As I'm not in Vegas all that often, I'll probably try another buffet next time.",

They have different stations for different foods like Mediterranean, Italian, Mexican, Salad bar and stuff, but a lot of things I tried were pretty bland or dry. Service is not that great here...slow...but you kind of expect that at a buffet anyways. They have a good dessert layout though, and cotton candy!

The Italian sausage was tasty. I had just enough room for my yummy bread pudding.",

Be sure to look for all the food stalls because you might miss it if you don't keep walking.  If you're a fan of king crab legs, this place is great because they cut the legs in half making it much easier to eat.  The shrimp tempura, one of my favorites, is perfectly crunchy, and if you like sushi, there's a good selection of rolls that aren't overstuffed with rice.  The fresh shrimp was a good size and perfect for dipping into cocktail sauce.  Like most buffets, there's the usual Mexican, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese areas, but also a Middle Eastern section.  Mmm.  Plenty of meat here if you like kabob, lamb and hummus.  The carving station also serves prime rib, turkey, and a bunch of other seasoned meats.  There's plenty of seafood like salmon and white fish, but there's also a wide variety of vegetables for the non-carnivorous.  There's also dedicated section for salad and another one for fruit.  There's a huge selection of desserts and they make crepes to order!  Kids will love the cotton candy maker.   All the food is clean, fresh, perfectly labeled and nicely segmented.  This place will have all the food you'd expect to find at a buffet and so much more that it truly raises the bar.  If you're a VIP, even better. You'll get to skip the wait to get a table and be seated in a private section that is even closer to all the good stuff.    Definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas!",

Just my luck :)  I think I ate a few slices of microwave pizza and some breadsticks. The mashed potatos were pretty runny but they tasted all right.   Ambience-wise, the place was pretty loud and filled with drunk people. Dinner was pretty pricey at $30/person",

We were planning to eat here anyway and we just happened to pass by the guy on our way there so we swooped on some coupons to get our 10% off! I think we paid about $35 for the dinner.. thats including automatic gratuity because i was with a group of 10.  They have all sorts of stations of food, most of which was pretty good. The dessert station is pretty awesome. They have cotton candy and they make dessert crepes. Yummm!!! Even though I went into food coma after, I enjoyed it here =)",

There was a variety of options but the food itself was sub par. The prime rib slices were small, crepes premade, pizza tasted like cardboard and seafood did not have a huge variety. Additionally we went for Easter where they had colored hard boiled eggs near all the food pastry items, however the manager later came by to say they were only for display, but we had already eaten them. My suggestion would have been 1. Move the eggs to the back counter so they are a colorful decoration display 2. Place a sign \"not for consumption\" 3. Take them off the counters completely. We spent the rest of the meal worried the eggs we had just eaten were going to make us sick which was not worth the experience. Will not be visiting this buffet again",

Also, if you have a big group and do not want to pay the charge, and split up the payment receipt, you will probably not get to sit together.  Our group tried and failed.   Experience here has been good every time. Food is fresh and there are a lot of options: carving station, American food, Italian, Mexican, Middle Easter, Chinese, and even Seafood.    They have lamb sometimes for dinner. Dinner food is usually a little better, especially with the king crab legs. The Sunday champagne brunch is awesome. You get unlimited mimosa and bloody Mary's with the brunch.  The servers are very good with filling your cup. I even got mine topped off as I was leaving. Awesome!   Overall, food is good and fresh. Definitely a good go to buffet in Vegas.",

The line did not take too long, since there was plenty of seating. It is priced at the standard Harrah's properties rate. 18.98 plus tax. The one thing I liked was the Noodle bar.

When it changed to Planet Hollywood, I ate here for a family reunion dinner and it was decent, it was better back then.  So, we tried it out once more during our most recent adventure to Vegas.  First off, $27.99 per adult for dinner, on a Monday?  That's Redonkulous with a capital \"R.\"  Thankfully, I'm not complaining much because I got a BOGO coupon so technically, for the s/o and I, it was only $14 each.  The buffet offerings were just okay.  Sure, they had crab salad and shrimp cocktail served in martini glasses but don't be fooled by it, it's not better quality, it's called perception.  They also had the usual Asian, Italian, American, Mediterranean and Seafood fare.  BTW, is it just me or do my fellow Asians act like savages when it comes to Crab Legs?  It's not like it's going to run out people, there's more where it came from, geez!  The salad bar, which was separated in opposite ends of the buffet had to be the sorriest salad bar I've ever experienced, even my hometown pizza parlor offers more salad toppings than this buffet!  But in the end, how can you be mad when they serve up fresh Cotton Candy?  Thankfully they put it high enough so the kiddies don't snatch it all up or get their cooties all over them. :)  Overall, if I had paid full price, The Spice Market Buffet would've gotten 2-stars, no doubt.  But since I didn't, in my opinion, it was worth 3-stars.  PS - Want a BOGO coupon too?  Just check in to Planet Hollywood on FourSquare, show your phone to the Rewards desk located near the bar and they'll give you your coupon.  Not sure how long this promo will last though.",

Noted the banner proclaiming that their buffet was voted as the number 1 buffet in Vegas in 2007.  Well, I can't say if it's the best since I haven't tried them all, but I actually did like this better than the Bellagio Buffet (which I just had the night before).    Weekday adult buffet price is very reasonable at $16.99.  Many different types of cuisines can be sampled here, including seafood, Asian, American, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Mexican.  My favorites were the tri-tip, BBQ ribs, smoked salmon, and apple pie.    Bottom line:  You gotta try this place.  One bonus...it's cheaper than the buffets at Wynn and Bellagio.",

He never checked the food on the buffet and never did anything about our concerns. I had been there a few years ago and it was much better. My advice to anyone reading this is too go someplace else.  Not worth the price at all.  Vegas has too many other options so don't waste you time or money at this place.",

I did like that they had a Mediterranean section because i looooove hummus, curry chicken, and other foods of the Mediterranean persuasion. I spent much of my time in that portion of the buffet trying out whatever they had. Not bad. Another plus was that the Mexican section had the bomb ass Mexican corn. Tore that up.  The dessert section was a major disappointment. Where's the cookies?! I love cupcakes & was super excited to see the variety, but they all tasted the same even though they were supposedly all these different fancy flavors. Boo. Ice cream machine kept breaking down so I couldn't get my kiddos the ice cream I kept promising them if they ate the food.

The only thing that was decent about the buffet was the desserts, especially their cupcakes.  The only reason we went here is they had two-for-one Groupon deals and they gave us unlimited alcoholic drinks.    We were surprised that if you go with a group of eight or more you have to pay an 18% gratuity fee.  I wouldn't be surprised if this was a sit down restaurant, but a buffet, that is crap.  The service was surprisingly very good (it better be for 18% gratuity) and our waitress was very nice.  They kept our mimosas filled and full beers on the table.  The food here was not the best, but not the worst.  I tried just about everything there but could find anything I really enjoyed.  They had  all sorts of different ethnic stations with a good variety of food, but none of it stood out as being delicious.  Just one step up from cafeteria food. I was told the mac n cheese was very good and so was the prime rib. They finally brought the crab legs out around 3 pm, but were still mostly frozen and they didn't have anyone to warm them up so you had to eat them cold.    If you are trying to save some money and find the Groupon deal then this is a great place, other than that don't waste your money on this buffet.  There is a lot better and cheaper ones around.",

I see many negative reviews, but I can't say I agree. I mean, if you compare it to the bigger, badder, newer buffets then yes, it seems this buffet is lacking a little in quantity, but I'm not comparing. I go for quality and freshness of food.   They have food from around the world... Seafood, Italian, Asian, Mid-Eastern, All-American, Mexican, and a dessert station with made-to-order crepes. Some main attractions for us were the fresh crab legs, cocktail shrimp, lamb kebabs, tandoori chicken, and some strawberry blueberry cream yogurt fruit salad thing (the name has obviously slipped my mind at the moment). This buffet is also part of the 24-hour buffet deal which we did last time. We didn't do it this time because our whole schedule was centered around eating and it was a bit stressful. So this time we just ate here and it was worth it!",

We ended up paying about $23 a person before tax to eat here and that is with \"unlimited drinks\" included. I put that in quotes because let's be real, how do you unlimited drinks when there's unlimited food--it just won't all fit.  Things to eat - Mediterranean station (I actually liked everything I ate here! Esp the lamb and grilled zucchini!!), thai eggplant at the Asian station, Buffalo popcorn shrimp at the seafood station, mac&cheese and the roasted chicken at the American station.  Things not to eat - sushi (this freaked me out bc there were like 3 types tossed in a bin together...), most of the pastas (blah taste, not worth the carbs), anything at the asian station (ie the calamari), or ANY OF THE WINES. I'm pretty sure the all you can drink wine was franzia or something similar, and you will feel a hangover coming on as you drink it.   Our waitress was a bit slow and didn't understand what \"the latter\" meant, but other than that was super lovely. Points to her for pouring all of our drinks into large water glasses instead of dainty wine glasses because she wanted to provide us more drinks faster. Also for giving up on the one alcoholic drink per person at a time rule.",

However they tasted fresh and I liked how they cut the legs in half so that it would be easier to eat.

I think they could use to lose a few tables and open up the dining area, also PLEASE pull your tables away from the area where people are walking to get to the buffet. I've never been seated so closely to the actual food. My table was basically IN the dessert section.  As for the food - there's a lot of selection and numerous \"stations\" with different ethnic foods to choose from.  I sampled mainly from the seafood; got crab legs, peel n eat shrimp, some buffalo popcorn shrimp (yum!), some sushi (dry, yuck). Tried some food from the Mediterranean section. Hummus, dates, lamb, naan bread, olives, etc. Okay, but not great, I've had better Greek food elsewhere.  Mexican, American, and meat carving areas did not interest me, although my Father-In-Law got a nice looking piece of prime rib. My husband also got some fried chicken that he said was quite tasty.  Desserts - Mainly their dessert section is cupcakes, although I did manage to find some pretty decent cannolis. The cupcake I had was OK, but kind of dry. I honestly don't even remember which kind it was now, but if you have a thing for cupcakes you will love this place.  Overall - not bad. Of course, my Father-In-Law paid the bill so I can't complain. But would I throw down money here myself? Probably not. I'd go to another buffet around town.  .",

The taste of the food is no longer up to the reputation this buffet is known for.  We were sitting close to the Asian food area and noticed the server tending to this station was not rotating the food and simply dumping the new food into the old food containers.   We also noticed the cleanliness in the area was terrible. We observed the person attending this Asian food are using deterrent rags to wipe down the areas and using the same rags to wipe down the spoons that were used to serve the food. We noticed this after we already ate something from this station and hoped we did not get sick from the food. We also noticed the person used something paper like sprayed with oil and held it up to the warming light of the food to create a flame in which he used to light the grill behind him. This was dangerous and absurd!   We took a survey from PH and mentioned our concerns and requested to be contacted and never heard back from them. This goes to show you they truly don't care about this buffet anymore.   The quality of the food served hear for a weekend brunch time period was terrible. The Spice Market Buffet used to be our favorite buffet in Vegas, but we will never come back. Stay far away!",

Even though I had a good referral from a trusted friend, the scene when I escalated downstairs looked pretty ho-hum, with standard large Strip buffet offerings. Any buffet can get you pregnant, but after a one-hour wait, I demanded that Spice Market pay for my food child's upbringing as well.   I immediately attacked the crab legs, great start, not quite as good as Wynn. Next the prime rib, best buffet prime rib I've had, period. The Middle Eastern section was terrible - tasteless hummus and dry kabobs. Honey hot wings were nicely crunchy, Italian homemade meatballs good, then back for more crab legs. Salad/fruit/cheese offerings for palate cleanse, all fresh. Creme brulee delectable, bread pudding less so.   Our waiter took awhile to get to us initially, but he was very attentive, which was great since we had unlimited booze on our $25/pp Travelzoo deal. If we didn't have to wait an hour, which I know isn't unusual for good buffets, I'd have left happier, but if you want to buffet, don't mind the wait, and you get a deal, it really is solid. The only thing better about my favorite, Wynn, is the environment, but is that worth $20 more?",

While it has come to my attention that VIP guests get seated first -- even if they are standing behind you in line -- there is no explanation of this offered. You are simply standing in line...waiting...while random patrons are told to bypass you and provided with a table. This is while several employees stand milling around, trying to accommodate priority guests.  Food:  This buffet boasts a modest selection of food choices for lunch:  Salad, Mexican, Soup, Middle Eastern and Desserts. I tried a kale salad, which was a mix of greens, olives, tomatoes, red onions and feta cheese. Not bad at all. From the \"Mexican\" selection, I chose a cheese quesadilla, which I figured would be relatively safe; wrong. The cheese inside was charred and made it difficult to cut with a knife and fork. From the \"Middle Eastern\" selection, I chose the rice pilaf and roast turkey. Sidenote: there was a father in line ahead of me with his young daughter. She decided she did not like the cut of turkey that have been provided to her and so her dad requested another slice. The chef then took the slice that was originally provided to her OFF OF HER PLATE and put it back on the carving board. He attempted to provide it to me, and I promptly refused it. I am not a Health Inspector, but once something is put on someone's plate, it shouldn't be taken back, no? Turkey was moist and flavorful, though.",

    "text": "I guess my biggest mistake was buying the Buffet of Buffets pass. Stayed at the Planet Hollywood for the first time so that I can walk around the strip instead of taking my car to everywhere I go. I guess it was really convenientonly because of where this hotel was situated. Rooms were pretty crappy too and so was the buffet.  Spice market buffet? Please stay away. I dont know exactly how much they charge for dinner but probably around less or more than $30 for sure. So not worth your money. All the selections they had out was just so horrible. This is probably worst buffet I have ever been to including the local buffets in town, for instance, Chinese buffets.  Crab legs they had, had no flavor whatsoever. It was hard to eat as well. Most of the food selections were all americanized or just american food even though it says it is Italian and Asian. Why do they even need to have different sections because its unnecessary.  Prime rib was dry and stiff as ever. The mussels and clams I had was so dry that it was so chewy I couldnt even eat them. Not to mention, the lady server was pretty rude as well. I asked for extra silverware and she just gave me this nonchalant look and walked away without saying anything and came back when? like 1000000 minutes later. I did not want to leave tips at all. Only thing that was good here was my iced tea. That's it. No kidding.  Anyway, to make things short, you wont get your money's worth here at all. Please stay away. Just dont even bother to buy the Buffet of Buffets pass. Just pay one time fee to the Bacchanal buffet. They are probably the best buffet in the vegas and you wont be  sorry.",

    "text": "Paid $30.99/person for buffet and unlimited soft drinks. The food quality was better than expected from some of the Yelp reviews. There were certainly things I got that l didn't like, but there were many, many things that looked good that I just didn't have room for.   The crab legs were pre-cracked so it was crazy easy to get out a ton of fresh crab meat. I wish I'd loaded up on more of these my first time around, as the secret had gotten out and increased the line size quite a bit after that.  Aside from that, my favorites were the crab salad (tasted like real crab again), the veggie spring rolls, spicy tuna and california sushi rolls, and cajun crawfish pasta. The poor Mexican station is to the far right and got next to no traffic, which was apparent not only from afar but from up close seeing how the food looked like it had been sitting there a while. I took a chance on the veggie tamales, though, and they did not disappoint.  Tons of dessert options, mostly in the small tart/cupcake variety. Cotton candy was gross. Red velvet cupcake was on point. They would make you a crepe with blueberries/strawberries/bananas and a chocolate sauce. They were small and really runny-- made in a skillet pre-made and not very well done.  Honestly, the only reason I don't give it that fifth star is two things: lack of higher quality meat/sushi that was listed, making it worth $31 each (I saw no steaks at all, just lamb at the Mediterranean station, and only 2 basic sushi roll options) and the wait/line process. Waited for at a minimum 25 minutes (and we were only about the 15th party in line) to pay up front for the buffet, then another 15 minimum for a secondary line to hand a greeter our receipt and have her show us a table. No reason both of these lines couldn't move more quickly. Plenty of space in the restaurant and unnecessary bottlenecking.",

I bought a coupon on Travelzoo and upgraded to All You Can Drink for an extra ten bucks.  At that or price it was worth it.  Most of the Mexican station food had been dried out by the heating lamps.  At the seafood and Eastern station they continued to cook fresh food throughout the evening and strangely  enough, the Chinese food station had better lamb than the Middle Eastern station.  Our service person was lovely and kept us well lubricated with the AYCD wine, even while bussing plates of uneaten shrimp off tables. We gave her a $20 which I thought was reasonable for all the work she did and she was incredibly thankful.   Bottom line - find a Groupon or Travelzoo deal and give it a shot!

As we sat in, the waiting area magically filled up completely.  The decor and ambience are decent, but it looks like any other mid-end restaurant down there, right down to the TVs placed at strategic spots showing sports.  Hey, if you can't draw customers in for the breathtaking atmosphere.. can't really blame them though, as this venue is actually in the basement of the building.  Yes, the variety in terms of ethnicities is probably among the better buffets in the Harrah's chain, but the food here is mediocre to be honest.  Maybe I was just spoiled as I had hit the Bacchanal (Caesar's) first, followed by Le Village (Paris) before this, but I felt the food was honestly nothing special, especially compared to food back home (Vancouver).  Yes you can get Mexican or Asian here, but overall I found the quality lacking.  The meats were often dry, and several of the dishes were quite bland.  Food is food, but if you are crunched for time, I would recommend going elsewhere for a buffet.",

Ambience is nice. No service whatsoever even drink refills are up to you. There's sections, Seafood,Asian, Italian, Mexican and American. Sounds promising until you see Italian is nothing but sausage and peppers, Mexican had chicken fajita with no seasoning and a condiment bar. Seafood had tilapia or mussels. Asian had chicken wings. I've honestly been less disappointed at the Circus Circus Buffet which has been notoriously ripped by reviewers at half the price.",

The soft drinks were delivered and topped up frequently which was good, but the food - just not that good. The Mediterranean station has grilled lamb that was overdone and chewy, prime rib was similarly overcooked and not worth the time.

    "text": "The food quality overall is decent given the price point, but the one star is for the incompetence of the staff. We were there around 5-6:30pm tonight (Wednesday). Our 4 year old daughter is allergic to pistachios, peanuts, and cashews so when eating out we always check if the foods we're ordering for her have any of those ingredients. With buffets, we usually check with the staff that are plating the foods (common sense would be that they would know what goes into the food). There was a lemon macaroon which we specifically asked the staff that was behind the dessert station if it had any peanuts, cashews or pistachios. They told us that it only had almonds and a lemon filling. About 20 minutes later our daughter's eyes were swollen and she broke out in hives. We called Planet Hollywood once we got back to the hotel to talk to the chef to double check the ingredients so we could know of this was a new allergy or not, and come to find out the macaroons did contain pistachios. The chef was surprised that the staff didn't mention it.  Needless to say, we gave her Benadryl, called our on call nurse and are currently monitoring her for any serious signs of a severe allergic reaction. Bottom line, DON'T TRUST THE STAFF TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FOODS.  Edit: Just to round out this review, the food was a lot better than the previous time we had tried this buffet. I'm not sure if its because they were busier last night than when we had went before. We got the unlimited drinks option as well, which made the whole experience better. Pretty much stuck to the mimosas as their beer selection is fairly basic. Our friends we went with really like the lamb kabobs served in the Mediterranean section, and I'd have to agree that they were pretty tasty and lean.",

    "text": "SBC VEGAS SERIES: 6 of many reviews Where to eat where to eat? I remember back in the day that this used to be reputedly the best buffet in Vegas.... hmmmmmm  People wake me up to head downstairs for some grub... a lil too much grub. I finally realized why I gave up buffets in the first place.. i can't stop knowing that there's more and more for the taking. Grant it there is a lot of food... enough food for days of binging. They got asian, mexican, italian, and then some. Looks like one of the the boats off of Dangerous Catch off loaded here.   But honestly, i wasn't that excited by it all. Nothing really grabbed me by the taste buds and kicked me in the face. I am much more about quality than quantity... most of the time that is. The most appetizing item in the whole place walked out as i walked in wearing next to nothing in 2 inch stilletos.  *sigh of resignation o_0",

I came here for brunch and was looking forward to the variety. Sadly, the food had me wondering what the hype was all about, and it's kind of a shame because I like what PH has done with the rest of the place...  The labels were pretty useful, I'll give them that. Everything was just really so-so, and even fun things like seafood were disappointing. The better section was probably the Mexican food. They have all the staples, but just fall really on the mediocre side in terms of quality.  The cotton candy is a lot of fun, so are the different desserts, but I wouldn't run back here for that.  Since going to Vegas is usually a vacation of some sort, I always figure I might as well budget a buffet like Rio or Paris. To eat here again, I'd need it paid for or super discounted.   Bottomline: Move along... nothing much to see here.",

The quality of the food is what sets this place apart from the chain. The room to eat is obvious and that is what makes the lines move faster so you can get yourself up in the game quicker!  No section stands out in particular and I would just recommend trying it all. whatever meets your taste!",

I can say this after going to the all the buffet available at Harrah's buffet special, this one and the Rio are the top buffets in that particular chain.  This one had great service, we were never rushed even as they were starting to clean up. The buffet food was your standard affair: prime rib, asian food, crab legs, etc. Nothing really stood out but at least the prime rib wasn't dry (kind of moist, a little salty). Completely edible.   The only thing I didn't like here was the BBQ pork bun. How can the skin by crispy instead of the soft white fluffy dough?!?",

Because I was staying in Planet Hollywood, and I'm lazy, I ate here for dinner and then again for breakfast.  At dinner, some of the food was pretty good, like the tandoori chicken, seafood enchiladas, and the barbecue ribs, but most of it was just ok.  The service was decent, but that changed the next day.  At breakfast, food again was mixed quality.  The tri-tip steak was delicious, potatoes were good, fruit was decent, most the other stuff (eggs, pastries etc.) was ok.  But the service was fucking awful; we waited about 10 minutes before our server took our order, and when I needed a refill it took a good 15 minutes before our server came by.  And when my friend asked him to replace her OJ because it was super watery, he gave us attitude and told us there was fresh-squeezed OJ at the buffet (which was not True).  He was a dick, and for maybe the first time ever i didn't leave a tip at all.  Spice Market used to regularly top the list of Vegas buffets, but either it's gone downhill or my expectations were too high.  It's still decent but I won't be back for awhile.",

It's not that the food was bad, it's just that it didn't stand out.  The Mexican food was ok, the Pizza......meh, the Prime Rib was tasty though and pretty tender.  My biggest disappointment was the crab though.  I was happy to see that they offered steamed snow crab, but upon closer inspection, it was pretty dry.  It's not like we showed up at 9:45pm either.  I usually fill up on crab alone, but I barely grabbed like 6 legs.  Kinda sad.  The dessert station was pretty nice though and the cobbler was actually pretty good with a nice crunchy crust.  Maybe next  time we'll just stick to the breakfast buffet.",

Pretty cheap compared to other buffets on the strip. Although the price didnt come with bottomless mimosas.   What I like best about the Spice Market is the Middle Eastern section! The chicken tandor, naan, hummus, etc was great! The chicken wasnt even dry. During brunch they also had made to order omelet's! So delish and you can get whatever you want on them. Down the way they have the normal buffet food, rib eye, mexican, italian, chinese, nothing that stood out.   I was disappointed when I didnt see crab legs!! I crave for crab legs in any buffet! The seafood section wasnt to grand. Although they have serve tempura shrimp steaming hot out of the fryer. The cocktail shrimp was good and they come already peeled and.  The DESSERT! They had everything from soft served ice cream, cotton candy, flan, bread pudding, red velvet cake, carrot cake, chocolate cake, tarts etc!! They have made to order crepes ( but the crepes are pre made and not freshly cooked!!)  The wait is not the long compared to other buffets food is good and the waiters are so friendly! Highly recommend to try the middle eastern food and dessert section!",

Most of the breads and rice dishes were dried out and the seafood was, well, very fishy.  I would avoid the raw oysters.  However, some of the food was good.  The tomato basil soup was great and the falafel and hummus made me very happy.  The sushi was also surprisingly good.  My b/f was pleasantly surprised by the meat and ate platefuls of lamb, ribs, and other animals.  The veggies were just ok, but the desserts were great.  The atmosphere is very hip and trendy and they gave us a booth, which was nice.    For $25, in Vegas, if you are looking to fill up on all you can eat, it is not bad.",

My favorite foods of the buffet includes huge Alaskan Crab Legs and fresh shrimp cocktails (yum!) They have beautifully decorated desserts that all look sooo good, but my stomach had room for only 2. I had the creme brulee and the tiramisu, and they were absolutely delicious.  From the Middle Eastern food section, I tried the basmati rice, which was really good, grinded lamb stuffed in tomatoes, pita + hummus and kabobs. From the Italian section, I tried some white sauce pasta, pizza loaded with tons of ham, and some other stuff that apparently didn't leave a lasting impression. They also had an Asian and Mexican food section, which were also pretty good.  Save room for dessert, because I was just in awe of all the variety of pretty-colored desserts that they had. If I could, I would have tried every single dessert - but that wouldn't be too good for my body, now would it? :)  If you don't want to pay $40 for a more expensive buffet, definitely go with this one. For almost half the price, you get a really good selection, and you will definitely leave happy.",

Their kabobs are very tasty and they have a good selection of pizza and pastas in their Italian section.  For those that go to the buffet but hate buffet food (weird, I know), there is a made-to-order grill station where you can customize your own hamburger.

First of all I waited in line for what seemed forever because the hostess was to busy talking to a co-worker and was actually eating something. Once I got past that I went to the table where it took a good 10 to 15 min for them to bring out a iced tea. As far as the food that I had the crab legs where decent there just wasn't a lot of meat but I expected that for a lunch buffet. However I had to really look around to find anything else that was edible and really didn't have any success. The seafood other than the crab legs and shrimp looked bad. The Italian food looked like it had been sitting all day. The American station wasn't appealing at all. They did have flank steak on the craving station but I didn't try that because I had some kind of other beef from the middle Eastern station and it was really tough. The desserts where awful took a couple and just took a bite and threw them away. Also the whole time I was there nobody came to pick up plates and the whole section I was in was the same way. I think there are better options than eating here and I probably wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "The Spice Market Buffet gets 4 stars for being the best-bang-for-ya-buck amongst all the numerous buffets in Las Vegas.  It really is quite a deal, considering the variety and quality of the food you get.  We got our buffets for only $ 13-14/person, and that was the lunch buffet!  That's a steal, considering the Wynn buffet is like $25, and the selection of hot food is not nearly as good as at the Spice Market.    Spice Market consistently wins the \"best buffet\" in Vegas mainly for it's affordability and top-notch quality.  It won in 2006 and again in 2007, and I'm sure it will be up again for 2008.  Granted, when you come to Spice Market, you don't really expect food like at the Bellagio buffet. But honestly in a blind-folded test, I think I would like the Spice Market buffet more than the Bellagio buffet.     The atmosphere is casual/modern, and there are nice green booths as well as open tables.  The colors range from khakis, to greens, to yellows, all in all to make a pleasant eating experience.  On the walls are several flat screen TVs showing the Food Network, so you can think about delicious dishes even more, and let your food digest while you look at someone else's fabulous finds on TV!  Spice Market has awesome pork ribs.  These ribs are flavorful and juicy, and practically melt off the bone.  They're exceptionally good, and I'm not really a rib person, but I kept going back for more of these!!  They also have awesome skewered roasted veggies at the Indian food station.  Huge metal skewers carry roasted zucchini, squash and eggplant, and each morsel of veggie is juicy, not-dry, and just awesome with every bite!!  Oh yes, the tandori chicken at this station is also very good.  It's not too dry, and you get these little kebabs of tandori chicken to go with your skewered veggies.  Check out the saffron rice with raisins in it!  It's awesome.  The meditteranean station is also a stand out at Spice Market buffet.  They have baba ghanoush, freshly made hummus, tabouli and grape leaves.  The baba ghanoush is very good, especially with a sprinkle of olive oil and dash of chili pepper.  Yum.  The seafood section at Spice Market has jumbo shrimp, sushi, lox and some hand rolls.  Not bad, but not really a standout.    The dessert station is pretty good---there's flan, chocolate mousse cakes, warm brownies, an ice cream machine with fruity toppings, and there's even a way to order your own crepe!  Service was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly, and kept clearing our plates in a timely manner.  He even offered freshly brewed coffee at the end of our meal.  Wow, I think the coffee was Starbucks, or maybe even Peets, because it was strong, hot and very flavorful.   Overall, for $13-14/person, this is a very affordable buffet in Vegas.  It's really good too, so don't think that you'll necessarily get a better deal at the Bellagio buffet.  I think the Bellagio and Wynn buffets are over hyped anyways.  Check out the Spice Market Buffet.  The ribs are phenomenal!!  And the after meal coffee is SOOO good.",

The crab is succulent and sweet. Many other buffets have overboiled, tasteless crab, but these legs are SUPERB!  They also split the legs down the middle so shelling your crab is not the ordeal it usually is elsewhere. I think I ate half my body weight in crab, so if I appear to have a reddish hue, that may explain it.  Prefer racks rather than legs? The honey glazed rack of lamb melts in your mouth. Tender, juicy and doesn't have the overwhelming \"lamb\" taste that turns many away. I'm honestly not much of a lamb person myself, but I did come back for seconds!  Most buffets make you peel your own shrimp which frankly isn't worth the trouble, but here, it's peeled already!  And the prime rib is cooked perfectly, juicy, and the chef cuts a slice to your specifications.  It is $30 a person, but if got any of these items off of a set menu, the price per plate would approximate that anyway and you couldn't get seconds!   Highly recommended, but come with a large appetite and a belt with a few extra notches.",

The snow crab legs were nasty---didn't even get one or try it.  All the other food looked like what ever...this only got 2 starts instead of 1 star, because I liked the \"middle eastern\" section.  However, I went here thinking I was going to have some crab legs.  Everything in the middle eastern section was pretty good: curry was delish, hummus was good, pieces of beef, lamb, & chicken were o.k. (some were good).  The pieces of meat were a bit cold  All the other sections just didn't look good.  Dessert: lots of different flavored cupcakes---didn't know what to get.

Kill two birds with one stone!!! This is very affordable if you are on a budget. The food quality is just fine and is more than what I would have expected for something so cheap.

Won't be back to the PH buffet anytime soon.",

    "text": "Upon arriving at the Paris Las Vegas, incredible hunger tempted us into buying the 24-hour-buffet pass. According to Yelp, this was the second best choice besides the buffet at the Rio, which we deemed too far since weren't here with a car.  Unsurprisingly, we thought the buffet was a tad worse than at Le Village but still decent. The selection was quite large and besides the Asian food (well what was I expecting?) and the seafood (only OK), everything was well-prepared. Especially the American section had delicious stuff and the carving station has high-quality meat. I got so stuffed on food before I even made it to the mediterranean and mexican section.  Perhaps the place gets worse when it's more crowded. We got here at 9pm, got in immediately and the service was impeccable. Our waitress was very nice, cleaned out our table swiftly and brought refills for our drinks way before we needed them.  3 stars because they had quite a few dishes that looked horrible (pork buns - ugh), but in general it's worth a look especially with the Buffet of Buffets pass.",

    "text": "No. That's pretty much the summation of my experience here.  I got this as part of the Buffet of Buffet packages, and since I hadn't tried this buffet yet on any of my previous 10 trips to Vegas, I thought I'd give it a go. The yelp reviews were somewhere in the middle, so I figured it couldn't be that bad.   First, I went the mistake of going after the brunch portions were cleared away. Eggs, bacon, and the like are easy, filling foods that are hard to screw up, and without them there's a good chance that the other food will be not that great. I was right.  The salad bar items were not too bad, but the meat was kind of gross. Any of the chicken items I tried were tasteless breast meat with no flavor and a consistency of wet toilet paper. And I'm talking about stuff that was supposed to be coated in middle eastern/Indian spices. NO taste.   The service sucked--our waiter evidently went home after he brought my friend her drink (she was seated a few minutes before me), and NEVER came back. I had to wait until my meal was almost done before we could flag down another waitress just so I could get a drink to wash down the disappointment that was this meal.   In the future, I'd give this one a miss, unless I was sure there were breakfast items available. Given that some of the food was passable, I have hopes that the breakfast items would make it worth the time. But other than that? No.",

When you're so sick of buffets from the first buffet you dined at but somehow still want the best bang for your buck on the 2nd meal...why do anything else?! Buffet #2 here you come.   the Spice Market Buffet always has a warm spot in my heart because of their brunch. How can you not love made to order OMELETS??? They have the typical omelet items... ham, onions, mushrooms, green onions, cheese... but you want to know the secret?   Here's the secret: go get a slice of the prime rib... chop it up yourself... then bring the plate w/ your chopped primed rib to the station and have (ARGUABLY) the best omelet experience of your life... haha, CLEVER, eh?!   The Spice Market Buffet has other items that are kind of unique--I love their shrimp tempura, smoked salmon and cream cheese, and crepes!! YUM... super buttery, but yum.   Come for Champagne Brunch and get your grub on w/ some mimosas, how can you complain when you can eat and drink?!! WINNER WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER (in this case, chicken brunch).  Great place to go, would get 5/5 but that's more reserved for the M-Buffet where you can get everything I just listed for about half the price on a weekday.  But the M's 9 miles away if you're on the strip, so convenience garners a strong review--well done SPICE MARKET.  P.S. I love walking thru the Miracle Mile Shops too--good way to build up an appetite.",

Every thing that I dumped on my plate was delicious, well mostly...   It was pretty disappointing when it came down to the crab legs, DAMN IT those were the ones I was looking forward to. & I couldn't find any \"BUTTAH\"... The hot AND also the cold crab legs were just too salty. And trust me I love to sprinkle my food with salt, to the point that I should \"Halt the salt\", but this one I just had to push it away to the side.     & since I was hung-over after my first night... lol I asked for some apple juice. I don't know if it was just me hella hung-over, but that was the BEST FXCKIN' apple juice I ever had, EVER!!! It was so good, it quenched my thirst and I love how the waitress put some ice in my apple juice, even when I asked for a re-fill. HEEEY, most people just don't do that... so I tipped her. See it's the little things that count too and I do take notice of, ya know.  Anyways... if your planning a trip to Vegas, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU GET THE BUFFET PASS, ALL ACCESS TO EAT AT 7 DIFFERENT BUFFETS, VALID FOR ONLY 24 HOURS, FOR $49.99 (non- member)!!! Com'on, you can't bet that offer. This buffet pass saved me $$$ and it will for you too!

    "text": "Is this a joke? It's called the spice market but overall lacked a good amount of spice. Kind of like an oxy moron if you ask me.   First I would like to begin with the fact that when a friend and I went to the section that said salads, there were no salads. No lettuce, no croutons no dressing. In fact there was potato salad, crab salad, macaroni salad but nothing that remotely looked like a normal plain green salad. Annoying? Yeah just a bit. I call that False advertising. We had to walk to the other side of the buffet to get a salad.   Next we headed over to the meat section. The prime rib was over cooked. The inside was grey. My husband like it but no one else in our party. I'm more of a medium rare type of girl with the inside a bright red. There were ton of other options as well. There was lamb but I didn't try it. Instead I opted for the mediterranean chicken they had which was shaped into little balls with a red coating and green spices. It was delicious an extremely tender. I was going to go for some fried chicken but it was too greasy an wa literally sitting in a inch of grease in the pan. No thanks.  Then the next thing that caught my eye were these shrimp filled martini glasses. Adorable! Great eye catching presentation! Tasted good, but i dont know how anyone could mess up that anyway.   Starting with my third plate I headed overto the warm crab leggs. It was nice to see them already prepared, cracked open and laying there. Super easy to eat and i loved them warm. Other buffets on the strip have them cold and i hate it. How hard is it to warm them?! The butter was in a cool and easy dripper that you could just grab a small coffee sized creamer cup and fill. The crab was okay, a little flavorless but i think it was because i got the last two crab legs in the pan. they would go so quickly that i had virtually no choice. There was already a line for the new pan so i thought what the hell, ill go for the last two, im tooooo hungry. They were good enough that I ate about 6 legs. Next on the plate I added some popcorn shrimp which was cooked to perfection. At other buffets i notice the popcorn shrimp becomes very mushy or soggy. No it was still crispy and full of flavor. It actually had some spice, hardy har har.   My last and final dish was desserts. Here was the best part of the night. They actually have a lady that does fresh crepes. I was able to pick out the filling and toppings. Wooo. Thats what im talking about baby. My husband went with bananas and i couldnt help but resist the apple. The lady made it in seconds and topped ti with fresh whip cream and drizzles chocolate allover it. holly hell was it delicious. the warmth of the dish made it melt in your mouth. im giving a star just for the crepe. After that I went back for the rasphberry cheesecake. Perfectly one bite it wasnt too sweet or bitter. It left you wanting more but perfectly satisfied. With just a tiny bit of room left, yes i had to remove my belt.. No judging please.. I went with the tiramissu bite sized cake. Tiramissu? eeek, not so much. Don get me wrong it was yumdeliumpcious but it tasted more like coffee cake.   Overall the only thing which i enjoyed to the fullet was desssert. This place needs more spice and much more improvement. I expected much more from PH. Will try again in the future for lunch to see if its a different experience.",

This is one of the WORST buffets that I have been to in my entire life, and living in Las Vegas for 24 years has definitely given me experience with buffets.  It was about $40 for two people at lunch. The food was horrendous for the most part, with the exception of a handful of dishes. It was unclear whether we had a waitress after we received our first drinks because she disappeared.   We would have been better off going to the Rio Buffet not only for the awesome local discount, but also because the food is A MILLION (no exaggeration) times better there than at the Spice Market Buffet. Even rinky-dink buffet-like restaurants like Souper Salad and Sweet Tomatoes have better offerings than this place.  Don't take the escalator down to this buffet, it is an escalator trip that spells impending doom to your stomach.",

There dessert area is full of over 15 different cupcakes which my favorite was the rum with vanilla cheesecake custard fill.  You can also find cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream.  If you are looking for seafood this also a great place to go too they serve hot and cold crab legs and you can find shrimp scampi as well as a assortment of shrimp.

We also watched a table of people sit with food in front of them for a good 5 minutes but no silverware. When they finally asked we watched the guy spend a few minutes dealing with other tables and plate pickups before returning.   On top of all of this the food was pretty terrible overall. I'm not hard to please and know what to expect from a strip buffet and this place was awful.   On the plus side we did the \"All you can drink\" option and were served frequently by a nice waiter. The desserts were also quite good.  I would only recommend this place to someone I secretly wanted to sabotage and would only return if it was free.",

There's seriously something for everyone. The chocolate dipped strawberries were a-mazing.  The downside is that a lot of their meats were dry aka fajitas and kabobs.  Regardless I would definitely eat here again!",

Me I am a vegetarian and quite skeptical and picky  of buffets and have been disappointed by quite a few on the strip.  That was until I ate at Planet Hollywood.  Not only was the Moroccan vegetables awesome ( with fresh pita bread ) but the gourmet Mac an cheese amazing. The apricot spread and cheese spread was amazing as well as the fresh fruit.( not dry at all )  The cupcake section was awesome , as the cheesecake bites where the most delicious , moist , melt in your mouth I have EVER had.   I got hooked on the cotton candy.  All the food looked fresh..  ( even the egg rolls melted in my mouth .. NOT DRY AT ALL)  ( my husband and daughter said they where impressed as well)  Our server was polite and checked on us quite a few times.  And I saw staff both sweeping the floors , and busers busy bussing  tables. Something both unusual. ( people working hard ).  The noise level was perfect , not loud not quiet.  The price was $25 a person. But you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  My one suggestion , go during the week about 1ish. There was NO LINE.  Out of 10 star's , 10 being the best and 0 being the worst I would give it a 10.",

I have to give only one star for this place mainly because of the demeanor of a cashier by the name of Mona who seemed to be ignoring us by not looking at us and moving to the back of the counter. She basically ignored us for about 5 minutes. When another couple came up behind us she quickly said \"Can I help you\". She should not be working in a position of greeting the public. She should be fired. I will follow this up with a letter to the management  The food at the buffet was not bad although expensive at $36 per person.",

We got here just in time to gobble up some breakfast, while they were transitioning to Lunch. I suggest taking in the middle-eastern food, and the omelet station for breakfast.  They offer a lot of options for drinks and the way they set it out is easy to read and understand.  Skip the seafood, and the crepes as they didn't look too fresh, but they have cotton candy; which is a fun touch.",

Most of the food is either very salty, over fried and greasy or flavorless. I'm a big seafood buff and I have to say their selection was little to none. No sushi except 2 types of pathetic little rolls. I didn't take pictures cause it wasn't worth the effort.  I tried it cause the reviews were mixed and there was a groupon- but not worth it. I think the best part was the Pepsi.  Spend the little bit extra and go for a nicer buffet.",

I went there for dinner  3 nights later and it was good but not as great as breakfast. I give breakfast a 5 and dinner a 3.5. The crab legs were cold which made me sad.

We went for dinner and here's the breakdown:  SEAFOOD - The crab legs were literally all shell. Everything else looked dry and over all I don't trust eating seafood everywhere so I skipped this section all together. The fishsticks tasted like something you get from the frozen food aisle and then just heat up.  ITALIAN - Almost all pastas were OVERCOOKED AND MUSHY. The pizza was ok compared to everything else.   ASIAN - Out of everything there my husband enjoyed the white rice the most (which I find quite sad).   DESSERT - It was nothing special, very generic. The frozen yogurt not good (how do you mess up a frozen yogurt machine?). They have a crepe station but guess what...the crepe are already pre-made all they do is heat it up for you.  MEDITERRANEAN- The lamb and chicken was decent. The Indian food all looked like it had been sitting there.  MEXICAN - By far the worst station, everything was dry!  If you have any standards of food for yourself DO NOT GO HERE. It is a waste of money and time. On top of all the terrible food when we got there we had to pay for taxes (bc we had already paid for dinner through Groupon) they wouldn't allow us to tip the server with a credit card so I had to go out of my way to get cash.   When there manager in the cashier department asked me how dinner was when I was leaving I told her it was terrible and instead of asking why she just smiled and said nothing else...",

There was only one couple in front of us, so we waited maybe a total of five minutes to \"check in\" and be seated.   Now that I'm thinking about it, compared to the other buffets, the interior of this one looked like a hospital cafeteria. Kinda drab, neutral gray and blue colors all around.   I tried the chicken marsala, but it lacked flavor. It didn't even really taste like a real marsala sauce. All I tasted was chicken. I like chicken, but if you're going to say that it's \"chicken marsala\" make sure that's really what the sauce is. I made the same comment to my boyfriend and he said \"I know, but I didn't want to tell you to disappoint you\". If he's saying there's no flavor...then that's a bad sign.   I do agree with the other reviews though, the shrimp tempura was my favorite part of the buffet. I would go back just for the unlimited amount of it. People obviously liked it as well, since there was a line waiting when they were refilling them.   And the boyfriend and I were walking out when we realized they had cotton candy. Nice touch. We didn't get any, but I thought it was cool. I probably would skip this buffet if I didn't have the BOB.",

My wait in the first line was 40 minutes, then I paid and had to get in another line for 15 more minutes.   Once I made it into the buffet I was sadly disappointed about the quality of food and the lack of options at the food stations.  Most of the food looked and tasted like it was sitting out a long time and/ or highly picked over.  If you wanted prime rib you typically had to wait yet again in line to get a slice.   I was excited to hit the dessert station with it's many cupcake options but was almost crying over my extremely dry red velvet cupcake.  The best cupcake I tried was the cannoli cupcake.  The only nice things I can say about this buffet is the price is low-ish and they serve beer and wine.  Otherwise I'd recommend hitting up Mandalay Bay or the Rio buffet for better quality, freshness, and options of food - just as  a buffet should be!",

Should have gone to M or Rio, only reason why I gave them a shot was bc we booked a room here.   First and last time here. Buffet should have a large selection for top dollars...I don't mind paying $40-$50 if it's has a bigger selection.

The server/busser will tell you that he can grab some hot ones for you but to me that equates to portion control and consumption control. Why would you do this at a buffet?

There's a wide selection of food from different regions of the world, but honestly, I feel like it lacks in quality. Food was mostly dry.

Lots of cupcakes, yummy dessert, and surprisingly they have fresh made creep, smaller size but much better than the creep in Paris buffet which topped with harden cream. a nice ending of meal with a cup of coffee with banana nutella creep and an ice cream cone. definitely coming back next time.",

I visited for brunch and the choices here included nothing that really stood out. ...Except the cotton candy...at a buffet brunch...any who, upon browsing the different cuisines (American, Chinese, Italian, Seafood, Mexican, etc.) the dishes/foods were those I could make easily at home. With that said nothing grabbed my attention. American had the standard eggs Benedict, bacon, hash browns, etc., and even the Italian had the expected lasagnas and other pastas. Even some of the food was dry; been cooked too long or has been left out for a while. There were plates I would fill up with food and then would only be able to eat 1/4 or 1/3 of a plate I grab because the flavors were bland or the food was worse than I though. I checked the Mexican, and Soup bars and did not even care for any items there.  The only thing that really stood out for me was simply crepes. They were smaller (about half size of a normal crepe), were pre-cooked, and the choices for filling was either strawberries or bananas foster/caramel (light; no-alcohol). There is a topping station that is next to the soft serve ice cream machine with again generic toppings, and NO NUTELLA. Everywhere I go where sweet crepes are served there is always Nutella, always.   The DRINKS included a variety of wines, Chardonnay, white wines, mimosas, etc. The mimosas were alright but the wines, white-wines, and Chardonnay were dry and lacked flavor.   Thankfully my party and I waited long enough for the lunch menu to be served and we pretty much closed down the Seafood bar as we got plate after plate of the crab.",

Other wise I couldn't say if I would pay full price for this buffet. When it comes to the buffets in Vegas this one is pretty small. They have separate areas for each cuisine (i.e. Mexica, Asian, Italian, Mediterranean, etc.). From what I got to try some of the dishes I thought were great was the pizza, anything from the Asian area I thought was pretty good. From the dessert section I'd have to recommend the frozen custard and creme brulee (happy they had that, it's my favorite dessert).",

Servers came by to clean up regularly and asked if the food was ok and what not. This is the 2nd time visiting this location and it meets all request made by my family. Will visit again, when we are in town.  May 2018 Had a great lunch/dinner with a large group and Mr. Tadesse did an outstanding job. He made sure we had everything we needed and made us feel right at home. Food selection was the best. Different stations to choose from. This was our 3rd visit.

Be warned though, it is extremely small and you will most likely have to wait quite a while during peak hours. Their famous mark is that they have food stations from different countries/regions, however their actual food selection is tiny compared to other buffets in Vegas. I went for dinner and tried a little bit of food from the various regions and overall it was decent, except for the seafood. The night I went they offered mussels in a tomato sauce. They looked good until I actually went to scoop them out and found that the mussels were rock hard as if they had been sitting there all day. In all honesty, the best and biggest part of the buffet was the dessert area.  As I said, its decent for the price but you can do much better at other hotels.",

I essentially got a little bit if everything, and nothing really wowed me. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good. For $28 after tax, I probably could've gotten much better quality food that was much more satisfying, although less quantity of course. The TVs were all playing the exact same game, and my college friends and I asked the staff if we could just change one of them on to our school's basketball game, but they refused to do so. This was very disappointing, especially considering half the restaurant was empty, and it wasn't like everyone was super invested in this one game anyways.

We watched her clearing other empty tables and placing silverware as opposed to hitting us up with our refills.  Considering there was no silverware when we sat down, I don't get it.    By the way,  who serves grape cotton candy?  So odd. The desserts were blah too.  Reheated crepes with previously frozen strawberries, Not good.

The mussels and clams were beyond dry, bacon was like rubber. The eggs Benedict was the only thing somewhat decent. Even the pastry wasn't very good. They sure make them look nice tho.

At the price of $36.99 for dinner, there was no crab legs! The staff told us they no longer had crab legs since last year. Could only find some cocktail shrimp and mussel as seafood. My wife and I walked up and down several times and found very few items that we even wanted to try.   Very disappointed with this restaurant.",

I am a dessert person, my friends like a variety of meat dishes...so we all got a long fine and dandy...there is something for everyone.... a variety of different foods... The Jay Z song \"International\" comes to mind. The most important aspect for me is..how is the coffee.... it did its job, perked me up and re-started my engine.... after an hour of us chowing down..

This wasn't my first choice for buffets, but we figured that by the time we made it to another place we probably would've been too late.  As we were going down the escalator, we saw an ad that said this buffet was voted the \"Best in Vegas\" in either 2006 or 2007...Not sure. But anyway, that made us feel a little better about eating there. It seemed like there was a big selection, but there really wasn't. I liked the tempura shrimp and the crab legs... but that's about it. The crab legs would've been better if I knew that we could've asked for them to be steamed and served hot. I probably wouldn't wanna eat here again.... and I'm sure there are wayyy better buffets on the strip.",

I also really like the fact that the crab legs are sliced in half so you just need a fork to get the meat it.  It makes it so much easier, and much less of a mess is made.  The desserts were also really really good.  They had all my favorites: Creme Brulee, Flan, and Crepes.  I think I ate more of the dessert than anything else there.  Hehe.  I have been here several times, and have not been disappointed.",

There is also a phenomenal crepe station where you can get crepes made for you on the spot. The usual dessert station is filled with some interesting stuff like cotton candy, little gourmet style cakes, etc. The downside is the sucky service and actually the food itself.   I don't want to say its like a sizzler buffet, but a lot of the food really just didn't stand out. The cold cuts, the pastas, the tandoori chicken were all pretty decent but none were great. You've got these cultural dishes that are really no where as flavorful as they would be from an average Indian (for example) restaurant. The service wasn't super awesome either. We weren't inhaling our food but the dirty plates kept piling up higher and higher. I don't know if thats a reflection on our eating habits or on the buffet waiters. I just know I was sitting by a huge stack of dirty dishes.  Overall for the price you kind of get a really good sample but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this to anyone. it was ok.  If you go, get the crepes!",

This is certainly not one of the cheaper buffets, but you get your money's worth in food.  We especially liked the Middle Eastern section (try the Persian figs, delicious!).",

Their seafood selection didn't impress me and to be honest, almost every buffet in Vegas has crab legs. I ate some here and they didn't seem that fresh at all. Like another Yelper had mentioned, go to the Rio buffet for some really good seafood. They had other sections like sushi (not great, warm sushi is never good), Middle Eastern, Italian and Mexican. I like a lot of variety in my buffets and I wouldn't come back to this one. The Mexican food was basically just a DIY taco station. The dessert section was the best part. I love chocolate dipped strawberries, so that was basically half of my dinner aside from the rest of the 'real food' buffet. I had to give an extra star because the service was good and it was clean.",

    "text": "This place earns 3 points solely for having pre-cut crab legs. Every buffet and/or restaurant that serves crab legs needs to take notes.  I personally rank this as the 4th best buffet in Las Vegas (after Carnival World, Le Village and the Bellagio Buffet). The price is rather steep, but they offer locals a 20% discount (which is barely advertised, so if you are a local, make sure you let the cashier know). Another con is that the service isn't all that good, at least from my experience, but I feel that if a restaurant is really good, then it's worth it to endure sub-par service.   They have a wide diversity of stations (including a Middle Eastern station, something that's rare in buffets), and they're all widely spread apart so definitely be prepared to do some walking. Typically you expect buffet pizza to be generic and plain by default but the pizza here was actually pretty exceptional. The dessert section was also quite huge, just don't order crepes there, since the crepes are pre-made and not fresh.   Like all buffets, just make sure you don't go on a holiday or any day where loads of tourists should be expected and the line should be quick and smooth. Would love to return soon.",

It's definitely set at a good price.  and for that, you get what you paid for.  Don't get me wrong, its pretty daymn good and I left the place carrying mah belly  and all, but if you were expecting something like the Rio, or from what I remember, it's not like that.  Their seafood selection isn't great, but it does have the usual snow crabs which taste about right.  I hate it when some places have them extremely salty.    But everything else is about a fair quality with a variety of foods from different cuisines.  I remmeber I kept going back for the crabs and mainly the prime rib.  Their prime rib and other roasts were definitely good as well.  So, if you wanna try a new venue, maybe check out the PH and try out the buffet.  AGain don't be expecting no Rio.  It's far from that.",

    "text": "You just have to go to a buffet when you're in Vegas right? It's like a right of passage along with drinking all day long and partying all night long. Essentially chose this one because it was conveniently located where we were staying = lazy hungry girls go to the closest place.   What you ought to do is snag some 10% coupons they hand out for this place. It's not exactly super cheap but I think the whole \"all-you-can-eat\" aspect and the large amount of choices make it a solid choice. We actually made it our one of two meals that day so it averages out in terms of price.   On to the food. They have a kind of \"world\" theme going with selections from \"Italy\" \"Asia\" \"Middle East\" and \"Mexico\" along with standard seafood and American stuff. Clearly it's  nothing super authentic  but you have a lot of options. Desserts are really diverse from tarts to soft serve to cotton candy (probably a huge hit with kids)!  My favorites: shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, all the fruit (very fresh), BACON, lobster pasta, crab salad,  bbq pork buns, and the prime rib. Things that were not so good: The guacamole was pretty gross. It was brownish and way too lemon-y tasting and actually most things from the Mexican area were just not good at all. Scrambled eggs were a little runny that day and I think the pizza tastes like something from an elementary school cafeteria. Of course this is all my opinion, I certainly didn't try everything (though I put in a good effort) and they have a lot of variety that is sure to please every palate. I think I was most impressed with the Middle Eastern section which was surprisingly good and certainly unusual at a buffet. \"Italian\" stuff is mostly pasta and pizza, don't expect anything fancy.   You will stuff your face here and they are pretty nice about letting you hang around for a couple of hours while you eat, rest, and then eat some more. Waiters bring you drinks and overall it's an OK place to linger if a bit cold (bring something if you plan on having a 4 hour feast as I got pretty cold).",

The food was pretty decent, lots of selection for certain, but some items I was looking forward to fell flat.  The Chinese food was actually worse than some of the crappy joints I've been searching out in LA (perhaps I need to up all of their reviews from the 2 & 3 stars they get).  They only seemed to have rare prime rib at that station.  While I like bloody prime rib, this was still mooing.    The real problem is the renovation going on at the Aladdin.  The buffet has moved to a temporary location upstairs (last time I was there is was downstairs from the casino) and everything is served in catering dishes.  It's hard to see the items and the labels aren't very large, so everyone walks along opening each (beautiful, btw) catering dish to see what's inside.  It's a little annoying, and it seems like some of the dining rooms are a little cramped.  The dining room we were seated in had a main walkway to get back to the food but it was so tight that at a couple points only one person could walk through at a time.  I hope the quality returns to my first impression, but regardless of what it does, I'd wait until the renovation is complete before dealing with this one.",

Although the prices have gone up a bit, the food has stayed consistently good (buffet good that is).  The variety is not the largest but they have a good amount of tasty foods.  I would have to say that their dessert lineup is on the weaker side compared to other top notch buffet locations in Vegas.  Be sure to try their champagne brunch on the weekends!

I went to the cashier to have a $100 dollar bill changed so that I could tip the waitress. While she was handling the money, I was talking to the Asst. F&B. When we left and were already home, I noticed that I only had $70 in cash after I gave our waitress her $10 tip. I immediately contacted the Asst. F&B letting him know that I was cashed out $20 short while I was talking to him. Until now, I haven't heard back from anyone at the restaurant yet. I know it was my mistake as well. I should have counted the money right at the cashier's. But if you really care about a great customer service, you would at least respond back to his or her message.",

    "text": "*My Personal Opinion*  What trip to Vegas would be complete without taking a journey through one of  the many gluttonous buffets? My friends and I decided to go to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner. With a $30-ish price tag it was like most other buffets on the strip. They had their layout with different stations. On the left side of the buffet they had the seafood station, next to it was the Italian section, followed by the Asian section, then the American Section, the dessert section the Middle Eastern, and then the Mexican section. Next to the Mexican station was the salad bar, but twas closed. I highly doubt anyone was disappointed at that.....cuz if you were....... In between the stations were soup stations, but I mainly stuck to the previous stations. The food was good, and they surprisingly had a decent variety amongst each station. The seafood station had crab legs for lazy people, and by lazy I mean they were already cut in half for you. What really won me over was the fact that they had shrimp tempura, and not a tempura mix. I'm a fan of vegetable tempura, but the fact that they had an entire tray full of shrimp tempura was awesome. Now you won't have to deal with people that just jack the shrimp and leave nothing but vegetables. When I went to the Middle Eastern section I got lamb. the lamb was a tad dry, but it was still good. I think when we were sat, the staff looked at us and thought \"I think it's best if we sit them next to the dessert station. Just look at them....\" I couldn't agree more. They had a chef that made crepes, just for you. But what won me over was that they had creme brulee, and carrot cake. I'm a sucker for carrot cake.   Twas a good experience, and the next time we go to Vegas this place will be brought up as an option again.",

The food was adequate - the ribs were dry with an unnecessary kick, fried chicken was flavorless, general tso's chicken was as dry as we every had, the ham from the carving station was dry, and many items were just too ordinary.  Having said that for less then $49 you got unlimited drinks and food.  The Mexican and salad stations were good as was the pizza from the Italian station.  We don't eat seafood but there seemed the be a lot of choices including crab legs.  Desserts were mostly assorted cupcakes that were okay.  They also had a crepe station and soft serve ice cream.

I'll admit that I wasn't as hungry as I should have been, and was kinda sorta recovering from a blackout the night before...so take the rating with a grain of salt, I suppose ^_^.  I got the breakfast buffet for about $15, which seems pretty standard for Vegas. Nothing really special about the buffet that I can remember, except that they had pizza, which made me really excited in the morning. Everything else was just your standard eggs, not-so-fresh bacon and sausage, hash browns, etc. I made it 3/4 through a plate before I grossed myself out, and I didn't get near my money's worth.   But the service was great! My waitress gave me two big glasses of OJ so I didn't have to ask for another later hehe...very considerate.   So yeah, if you're staying at the Planet Hollywood, it doesn't hurt to grab breakfast here. But I'd vie for breakfast over at Le Village Buffet in Paris instead *wink wink*",

Yes, I was impressed on site with the around the world selection but has anyone actually had food from these regions. This white boy, often assumed to be Jewish, from Brooklyn/Queens could have made better falafel, in fact I do. The hummus and baba ghanoush were so oily and yet this food was my staple selection twice. Why? Because despite the plethora of pastas in the Italian section, only ONE came without meat.  O I mean come on. Kick a veg while he's down why don't ya? At least there was vegetarian sushi.  I was also a bit disturbed to see a sign for Italian and then there's Asian but Sushi is its own \"sushi\" station. Ok, racists and cultural xenophobes, if pasta and pizza gets\"Italian\" then Sushi gets \"Japanese\" and \"Asian\" gets renamed with the country that most of the food there is best identified with, dare I say \"Chinese\" because if you were going to call it \"Asian\" where was the curry lentil dal and sag paneer? Feel me?  One less star for showing Vegas may co opt the Spice Market idea but can still put forth the middle America cultural insensitivity.",

Unfortunately this place did not meet the hype that it has for being the best buffet of 2007. The setup of the place could have used a little more work too because some sections were too far away from one side and that it might have easily been unnoticed. I expected a much greater selection, but since it was lunchtime and it was cheaper, I'll let it slide. Good food though nonetheless. I still recommend the buffets at the Rio or the Mirage.",

The food is solid. They cover all the basics (prime rib, roast turkey, asian, italian, dessert, etc.) and turn out some slightly creative dishes. Most of it is extremely hit-or-miss (hit the Tandoori Chicken kebab, miss the falafel). For a buffet, the service was fantastic. But for the prices you're paying, you might as well shell out $3-4 and try the Wynn.",

I have to say, there were a variety of breakfast foods to choose from and they were just a-ok.   I am giving it 4 stars because the CREPE station was freaking awesome.  I had my doubts when I saw the already made crepes and fillings, but when they put it together, it was  fab-u-lous!  Also, the service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive!  For $15 bucks, it wasn't so bad.  If you look around, there are $5 off coupons available and you can also look online for them.  But remember to read the coupon because I brought one that was for the Planet Hollywood buffet in Caesar's Palace. So I didn't get the discount, but the $15 bucks per a person was still doable for me!",

The food was awful. There was a large variety of food, but the only thing that tasted good was the prime rib. Some of the food was cold, the rest just didn't taste good at all. We sampled a little from each station, and we didn't eat a full plate of food between the two of us. This is no place for a foodie. The dessert station greets you as you wait to be seated, and it looks delicious. I got two cupcakes and could not eat either of them. One bite and I was done. They were awful. If I didn't use a coupon, I would have been very, very, very upset. We had half off coupons from one of the street vendors. So I didn't fell too bad about paying for such a disappointing dinner.",

You'll see outside when you line up all the awards the buffet has won. Sadly, this is all in the past. The buffet today at Planet Hollywood is awful and nothing compared to before. The dim lighting had always been a turn off to me, but the food used to be so amazing and unique that I had to come here every time. Now I don't make any stops at this buffet during my annual trip to Vegas in December.  Taste and variety leave much to be desired. Food here used to taste like it was made by a real chef. Now the food tastes like something anyone can make.   One star. I hate how the buffet began as king, the best on the Strip, and transformed into a place with terrible food.",

Luckily we had our total rewards member card which saved us a few bucks off the dinner price. We were seated right away since we came right before dinner and instead of waiting for them to get your drink order before you chow down, there's a card on the table for you to choose your drinks and leave to grab some food. I guess that's pretty cool cause when we came back with our first plate our drinks were already ready.   They have different sections offering Asian, Mexican, American, Middle Eastern food as well as the standard seafood selections. Id say they all were decent for the price, it's nothing spectacular. I really enjoyed their desserts though. I had to make sure to save room for the sugar high I was about to embark myself upon. All those fruit tarts, chocolate covered strawberries and cotton candy definitely was good.",

First off the line to pay and get seated was extremely long and not worth the wait, took about an hour to finally sit down and eat and only for a partt of two. Service was awful, When we finally got seated our servers took about 10mins to ask us for anything to drink, in addition to that brought us the wrong drinks. We expected so much more out of the food. The main problem we had was there was no option to steam the crab legs in order for them to be hot. We have been to other seafood buffets where we have been able to take our crab legs over to be boiled for a sec if u prefer them warm, which we do so that was very disappointing. Prior to coming to the buffet we looked in the \"buffet of buffets\" brochure and it stated that they steamed the crab legs. We approched the manager and showed him it and he was upset and stated \"we havent had steamed crab legs in 4 months\". After that we were not only diaappointed but also fustrated that things were falsly advertised. On top of that the food was very mediocre in our opinion and not very fresh. Our expectations might have been a lil too high because our last trip to vegas we went to the buffet at treasure island and it was so much better. Being this was a newer hotel and everything i thought it would be better. Sadly, we definietly will not be returning wish i could rate no stars",

I'd eaten here ages ago and remembered it being good, but I was pretty disappointed.  I'm a meat-eater, and the prime rib was pretty tough.  Prime rib quality is usually a good indication of the quality of a buffet.  There were a few other meats - ham and some sort of breaded meat - but they didn't look particularly appealing.  The seafood selection consisted of shrimp cocktail (standard fare), shrimp in a cream sauce, stuffed sole and lox.  Where were the king crab legs?  I know a lot to ask for...but I was hoping for more at the seafood section of the buffet.  There is a Mexican food area which was fine - guac, tamales, etc. and Mediterranean food.  I don't know what was up with that falafel but I was not down with that, though the hummus was decent.  On the positive - there is tons of variety, so people will find something they like.  And the bacon is extra crispy unlike some of the soggy, not-really-fried bacon you get at other buffets.  Also, even though I'm not a dessert-eater, the desserts looked great and they got good reviews from my friends...",

The price is extremely reasonable for the area, but expect selections of food for what you paid for. Basically its almost half the price as other buffets in the area such as the Bellagio, Aria, etc. The food options are pretty much B-class items.  I went on a weekend for breakfast and they offered your usual eggs, meats, omelet station, beverage station (very limited selection if I may say) fruits, pastry, oatmeal. Very mediocre, I would definitely recommend if you are on a budget, but otherwise, choose your other places even if it costs extra $.",

The seafood selection was very poor and o oy 2 items, a shrimp scampi and a fish in some sort of sauce and cheese, disgusting.   The Asian section didn't have any Asian food which was absolutely ridiculous and the Mexican food 2as cold and you can tell the quesadilla was sitting for a while.  One star is being polite, even the server was no where to be found, and I gave a 20% gratuity even before i sat down.  I wouldn't recommend this place",

After almost a year of avoiding the Spice Market, we finally went back for an early dinner last night. They have fewer servers and non-alcoholic beverages are now self serve. The concept seems to work. You don't have to keep trying to flag someone to get a drink anymore. I do feel bad for our server Rose who had to serve alcoholic drinks then do clean-up as well. She was a trooper though even when it got pretty busy.   Aside from the crab shrimps and prime rib, the chicken curry was still as good as I remembered.  From the other dishes I tried, the lamb kabob wasn't as successful, it was dry. The paella was blah, the steamed mussels were dry, steamed pork bun barely had any meat in it, the egg roll was so-so . For dessert, the macaroons were always good, so was the red velvet cupcakes. The creme brulee was ok, the creme caramel had a different flavor I didn't like and of course the cotton candy is always a hit.   Inspire of all the fails, I still think it's worth giving Spice Market another try with a coupon.",

We ended up at Spice Market Buffet because the original buffet we went to had a 4-5 hour wait.  The line wrapped around the casino.    Spice Market Buffet is located downstairs in the middle of the casino.  Not a very large buffet but I'm happy to say that they have rooms towards the back for large parties.  We were a party of 14 and with 5 Diamond members.  The front cashier was a bit rude.  Wish I got her name.  She was middle aged and worked on Thanksgiving Day around 4:00 pm.  She did not smile and had a straight face.  I asked if we could get seating for 14 people and she said we cannot seat your party if everyone isn't here.  Which was fine, we understood.    My party of 5 paid for our buffet and explained to the person who was ready to seat us that we have a party of 14 but the other 9 is in the casino making their way down.  They wanted to charge us 18% upfront but we told them we already paid.  :(    Despite of everything, they sat us in the back room.  YAY!    The buffet line was just alright and quality lacked for me.  The turkey and ham served was dry.  Actually extra dry and over cooked.  I was so hungry I didn't care.  I thought to myself it was a cheap $30 buffet so I'm not going to complain.  I definitely needed a redemption meal later.  :(   Our server who worked a double that night was very nice.  Glad she got me a glass of red wine.",

The desserts were dry and tasteless.  Cookies were thawed from frozen as the bottom was wet.  Seafood consisted of small pieces of breaded and spiced fish. Also a pasta slathered in an Alfredo sauce with a few pieces of overcooked shrimp.   There was not one item that could be considered from decent Finally, when you pay at the entrance,  the slip you sign has  suggested tip amounts. I'm a good tipper in general,  but there was no service. You need to get up and get your own drinks at a machine. Since you get your own food,  what should you tip for?",

    "text": "The last time I was at the Spice Market Buffet was about three years ago.  I am improving this place by just one star; however, overall I still likely would not return again in the future.  We came to Spice Market with two people on a Saturday evening at about 8:45PM.  This place suffers from utter disorganization. There is one hostess that was seating people, and there was no order like other buffets. At other buffets they usually have multiple people hosting and taking care of tables.  This place...not at all.  We actually walked around the restaurant three times with her, while she waited for a busser to clean off a table.  It was ridiculous. She had no idea where she was taking us.  The good news and the reason for my one star improvement is the food truly was better.  Almost everything I had was good to very good.  I was pleased with the food and the taste and quality seemed to be improved.  The one thing that made me more upset than anything else, was the fact that they have eliminated all service from this buffet.  I believe in tipping, and I believe in tipping at or above the normal rate.  I believe service people work very hard.  Even at a buffet, I tip.  Therefore, when I entered, because you pay upon arrival, I tipped $5.00 (which I feel is appropriate for limited service at a buffet).   However, to my surprise, after getting to the table -- I was shocked to find out that there is no longer service at this buffet. That is correct folks -- they have completely 100% eliminated all service.  Other buffets usually have drink service...not this one.  You get everything on your own.  Is that a problem?  No, it is not.  However, there should be absolutely no gratuity line on the receipt.  In fact, when you went up to get a drink, they wanted a tip. When you went to the crepe station, they wanted a tip.  There is no excuse for this and it reflects negatively on Planet Hollywood and this buffet.",

The had prime rib and the crab legs sawed in half.  All kinds of other foods, but i focused on the prime rib, the mashed potatoes (super good) and the broccolini.  I also liked the strawberry tarts and creme brulee for dessert.  It's not fine dining, but great for the price.  Where else can you get good prime rib (all you can eat) and all the dessert you want??  Be sure to sign up for the Total Rewards through Caesars and you should be able to get a free buffet.",

But yeah, it was very subpar...most of the dishes consisted of potatoes! I'm saying...hash browns, ranchero potatoes, potato hash, etc...hella spuds! Selection was very poor compared to other Vegas buffets.  I wasn't even hungover or anything, but you're basically dining in the dark here. Seriously, turn up the lights a little bit!  For similar pricing, you're better off eating next door at the Paris buffet! I'm glad I only came by for breakfast (~$20). Based on their breakfast items, I wouldn't have high expectations for lunch/dinner.  Final thoughts? AVOID",

Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino Spice Marked puts on a good spread at a reasonable price.  The food is good quality and average to good in taste.  The real star of Spice Market is the large variety of moist yummy cupcakes in the desert station.  There is at least a dozen varieties of cupcakes!  The soft serve ice cream is the same Custard type of ice cream served in the Paris buffet and it is simply my fav.  There is also a Groupon currently available for two including \"all you can drink\" alcohol :)",

Food selection was great and tasted good. BUT we just went there last night and we were surprised that there was no line to pay. This was Saturday night at 630pm!! Now, we know why. We read every bad review here on yelp and they are all True! Food was bland, selection was limited, and the glasses were dirty. It's just really sad that one of the top buffets is now at the bottom of everybody's list. A little good service would have made our food taste better but nope, we asked one of the employees if the soft serve ice cream had egg because my daughter was allergic, they said no and smirked. So my daughter ended up throwing up the rest of the night. DO NOT EAT HERE!! Pay more for another buffet.",

    "text": "Oooh! Looks like I'm review #1,000!  My boyfriend and I came across a Groupon for Spice Market and decided to purchase the buffet option. For $43, two people get all-you-can-eat-and-drink (including beer, wine and champagne) brunch. There are also breakfast and lunch options for weekdays but the dinner choice is currently sold out.  I'm giving Spice Market four stars based on the alcohol (bottomless mimosas...hell yea!) and the incredible dessert station. The rest of the buffet was decent but probably three stars at best.   Things I loved:   The cupcake selection was phenomenal! There must have been about 12 different varieties of fancy cupcakes. I tried four (cookies and cream, chocolate mint, caramel apple and smores) and, like a little piggy, almost ate all of those four cupcakes. My personal favorite was the chocolate mint (super creamy mint frosting) but all four of them were incredible. If only I had more room in my belly!  The prime rib was great! Perfectly cooked and tasted like perfection when dipped in the au jus. I enjoyed two slices of the tender meat.  The mac and cheese was surprisingly good. I've tried it at other buffets and always find it to be bland but here is was perfectly seasoned and I even went back for seconds. The chicken pesto pasta from the Italian bar was also a tasty dish.  Things I Didn't Love:  The fresh-sliced turkey was dry and the gravy had a funny taste to it. I love turkey and gravy so this was big disappointment.  The salad bar was very tiny. I know that not a lot of people go for salad at a buffet but I always like a little salad to go with my meal. I guess it makes me feel slightly healthier while gorging on all the deliciousness. But there were very few toppings and the ranch was not to my liking (I'm very particular about the ranch dressing at restaurants).   The mashed potatoes, which I admit that I didn't even try, looked incredibly runny and strangely yellow. What happened to fluffy white potatoes?   One other quick note, if you have a group of 8 or more, they charge you a mandatory 18% gratuity. We, of course, had exactly eight people. I think this is crap as it is a buffet and they're not really doing much for us aside from pushing a couple tables together. And if we had seven instead of eight, they wouldn't charge us? Seems a bit ridiculous!",

Came back the next day at 5, the line wasn't too bad, maybe 100 people from the escalator. Little did I know there was a line once you enter the escalator as well. So in total we waited maybe an hour and 45 minutes. The food isn't that great and they don't restock it so everything's old. I feel bad for the worker here. One guy cleaning up all the tables in one huge section. So the dishes piled up high before he could come to our table.. They need more workers. I'd rather go to Cravings at the Mirage.

I have always like the Spice Market's cheese tray.  I had some nice pieces of bleu cheese this evening to enjoy with dinner.  Then I turned my attention to the Middle Eastern section where I had some lamb kebabs, chicken kebab, and hummus.  I enjoyed them all.  Finally, dessert.  For the first time at this buffet, I had their made to order crepe.  I tried the Bananas Foster.  It's semi hand made as the crepes are pre-made.  The cook heats the crepe in a pan and adds whatever filling you want from a nice selection, folds it, and puts any topping on it you want.  Service was excellent.  The server brought me a new glass of iced tea before I was finished with the one I had.    We will be back.",

Our waitress took our drink order and brought them out promptly. The buffet was set up nicely; they have stations that serve different types of food, like most buffets. I liked everything I tried, which is rare for me. The food was of decent quality and I didn't feel like I was eating cafeteria food. They had varieties of Mexican, Middle Eastern, Italian, All-American, and Seafood stations, as well as salads and desserts. I would recommend trying the Mexican food; it was my favorite station.   The desserts were great also, my favorites beings the Boston cream cupcake and the bread pudding. However, while they had a lot of cupcake flavors to try, that was pretty much all they had, lacking in overall dessert variety. For the price we paid, I thought it was worth it and would come again. I recommend getting in a little early for dinner to avoid waiting in the long line.",

If you answered \"no\" to these three questions, then move along. There is nothing to see here. It is a very standard, very boring, very unexceptional buffet. There is no possible reason you should choose this buffet over the dozens of other options in Vegas. It's 2 Stars.  Add an extra star if you are staying at the hotel, because hey, it's close.  Add an extra star if you bought the buffet of buffets pass and you've already eaten at Le Village over at Paris and both buffets over at Rio and the one at Harrah's is just too far to walk right now and besides you already paid for it so it doesn't cost you any extra so you may as well eat here anyway because your pass runs out in a couple hours.  Add an extra star if you are the type of person who randomly screams \"Muad'Dib!!!!\" any time you happen across the word \"Spice\".  For me, it was 3 stars. I will let you guess as to why.",

    "text": "We ate at Bacchanal yesterday and spent three times as much.  Two days ago we spent twice as much at Wicked spoon.   We ate at Spice Market with a discount from travelzoo.  Thanks goodness for the discount.  Because if I had paid full price then a 1 star review would be more appropriate.  Spice Market is overhyped, apparently.  There's NO WAY that this buffet is anywhere near the same league as the other two we tried.  At Bacchanal they had four salads I tried that were all excellent.  I could have have enjoyed any one of them as a meal.  At Spice Market there was basically a bowl of greens and a few bowls of vegetables so you could make your own salad, like you would at Sizzler, oooh, fancy.... not really.    At the better two buffets they had Gelato, they even had Sugar-Free Chocolate Gelato at Wicked Spoon, and it was excellent.  At Spice Market they had soft serve ice cream... which isn't even really ice cream it's basically cold, artificially flavored vegetable oil like what you'd get at McD's.  Disgusting and not worth messing your diet up for.   The carvers at Spice Market were rude and condescending.  You had to wait in line for a HALF a piece of chicken.  If you tried to serve yourself you got yelled at, WTF?  The seafood, which I didn't try smelled really strong, like week old shrimp.  My eyes started to water in fact when they nearly seated us near the seafood station and I asked to be moved.  They had a Middle Eastern food section.  They had Lamb on the skewer and off the skewer.  Off the skewer looked older and possibly recycled.  My wife and I each got some, but it was too rubbery to be chewed.  One of the chicken dishes I tried was too dry to choke down, some of the grilled squash was tasteless, while the grilled zucchini in the salad bar was decent.    At Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon EVERYTHING was cooked perfectly.  The grilled chicken breast was so juicy I even went back for a second serving!  The Peking duck had crispy skin... Truly talented chefs.  Not correspondence cooking school dropouts.   In the Asian section there were two odd looking dishes they called Chef's specials.  Couldn't even tell us what kind of animal it was or how they cooked it?  I suspect we were being experimented on.    My overall impression was that this is a buffet where you can get a coupon and save some money, then pretend you're eating the same thing you'd get if you weren't so concerned about saving money.  We had a limited time in Vegas, only got to hit three buffets (three tours & four shows).  This place was a waste of time, left me unsatisfied and feeling gross.  I ended up throwing out a lot the food that I wanted to enjoy, but the quality and the skill of the cooks just wasn't up to standard.    Do yourself a favor and don't go.  The other two I recommend highly if you have the few extra bucks.  Maybe a little less drinking or gambling?  I assume you have SOME disposable income coming to Vegas and reading buffet reviews.  Want to enjoy the meal of a lifetime?  It won't be done here.",

Dude.. but we just had a sandwich from Earl's like.... an hour and a half ago...  So we dove right in and ate as much crab legs as we wished.  I like how they're half cracked already.. so it's semi effortless to just get the crab meat and dunk it in butter.  The salad bar--if you're into it does not have a lot of 'toppings'.. however i did like the tomato salad for some reason because of huge mozza balls.  (I honestly was just too overwhelmed with all our meals; all i wanted was a salad at that time... and i couldn't pass on crabs of course)....  They have a nice array of dessert that my husband enjoyed. He particularly liked the bread pudding.  Service was excellent; but I wasn't wow'd much with the selection.",

I spent most of my time chowing down on the crab legs to get the best bang for my buck, and succeeded with crushing atleast 3 full plates of them, but  I also tried to stuff myself with some of the other buffet offerings. The crab legs themselves were pretty good, but I've had better. Nothing else I tried was really all that great. The baked desserts were dry, the soups were overly salty, and the other foods did not taste very fresh.  Priced at $35/pp my first Vegas buffet experience was pretty disappointing, and I was expecting so much more... but no worries, it's definitely not my last. At least they had a mexican bar where I could make my own guac and chips? Guac is my kryptonite.",

Not the best buffet ever, but good and cheaper than Wynn, Caesar's, etc, plus we were staying at PH. I preferred the American food over the more exotic choices. The yukon gold mashed potatoes were amazing!!! The prime rib was the best buffet prime rib I've ever had. Waffles were fantastic, chili very good, shrimp tempura good, and a fine selection of desserts. Made to order crepes, yum!  Our server was fabulous! She kept our glasses full of mimosas and was very sweet and attentive!!",

    "text": "The main reason I decided to try out the Spice Market Buffet was because there was a Groupon with a great deal. For $45 my boyfriend and I could eat at the buffet AND get unlimited drinks (alcohol included, OH YEAH!). Since our stomachs were empty and the deal was the right price, we decided to go for it.   Upon arriving, we had to wait in line for about 25 minutes or so. It was about standard for any Vegas buffet. While in line, our mouths were watering as we read the different summer time options they had on the board.  Sadly, this place proved to be like majority of the buffets I decide to try on the strip that are not Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. The food selection was decent, but half of it just did not look appealing. The kabobs looked a little charred and burnt, the pasta had an off taste to it..it just wasn't what I was expecting.  The only thing saving and adding an extra star to this place would have to be the crab legs. The crab legs they have contain a lot more meat then the crab legs at other places. By the end of the night, I was content with just eating those.  Would I come here again? Probably not, unless I was craving nothing but crab. In my opinion, save your money and go somewhere better.",

The had a different sections of foods, typical of most buffets. I will have to agree with another writer,  I stayed away from the Asian/Chinese nothing looked too amazing there. I killed the Mexican section, but I think I mentioned that already. Stayed away from the desserts, the pizza looked pretty bad so I steered clear of the Italian section altogether, the seafood section could've been better but the friend buffalo and coconut shrimp were pretty good, stuff sole was good too!

The cashier desk is located in the middle of the Buffet. Since we already bought a 24 hour pass all we had to do is show our ID's and our Total Rewards card and we were in!! Lucky for us, that we were seated at a table that was close to the action. Large plasma tv's were hanging in different area's and had either MTV Hitlist or ESPN on. This buffet is on the smaller side but make no mistake it holds alot of yummi foods!!  Highlights of the action:  Tandoori chicken, hummus, couscous, stuffed tomatoes with ground lamb, Pita bread,lamb skewers,tabouleh, chicken in curry sauce  Crepe-making station   All different kinds of salads  Tacos,Quesadillas,Tortillas, Guacamole and Salsa  Ham and Prime rib   All kinds of yummi breakfast foods: Eggs, Bacon, French toast, Pancakes, Waffles, Hash browns and who can forget the made to order omelettes!!  Pizza, Lasagna, Garlic breadsticks and Pastas with different sauces  Shrimp Cocktail, Sushi (again i wouldnt recommend),Crab legs  Eggrolls, Noodles and Dim sum  Dessert: Cotton Candy (heck yeah) Ice Cream Cookies Pies Cakes and the list keeps going and going!  Our waiter was kind and our water glasses were always refilled when asked,plates were cleared after we were finished as well! Only beef i have is when i went to the carving station there was no one there. I waited along with a couple other hungry customers for about 2-3minutes till one of the servers noticed he had a line. Geez buddy, if you know its busy then stay out where we can see you!!!",

First, while eating the food, I watched the chefs use their bare hands to transfer food from dish to dish (yes, the food you eat!)  Generally, I'm not a big complainer, but when you go from ready to serve food, to your dish towel, and back to ready to serve food...I'm less than thrilled.  Next, I watched the same chef take food OFF of a customer's plate, and place it back into the serving line! Oh my! Glad I didn't eat the prime rib, because she served the SAME piece back to ANOTHER customer!  As for the food? More than half of what I ate was cold, or lukewarm at best.  I actually had my waitress test the sliders, as it was still mostly frozen! Such a waste!  Also, for a place with such good reviews on the desserts, I can't say that I was at all impressed.  With so many choices, and not a single label identifying what any of them are, how do you know what to try?  Those that I did try were totally bland and tasteless.  So disappointed in this Buffet!",

Honestly, it was good! 4 stars is maybe a bit much; it's more like 3.5 but I will round-up because of the big selection and attentive service (my champagne glass was always kept full and the waitress even gave us refills to-go). There is a huge variety and the majority of the selections were very tasty. I don't think I'd go back for just the buffet by itself, but I'd come back as part of the \"Buffet of Buffets\" pass.",

A lot of the local buffets get boring after a while, but this one continues to have a nice variety of food with some items you don't see at any other buffet. The people working there are always super nice. We usually go for lunch, and we've never been disappointed. The dessert station alone seems worth the visit to me. We got to LOTS of Las Vegas buffets now that we live here, but this is one of our favorites.",

    "text": "My friend & I were just there yesterday & Sunday (we got the 24 hr pass for $44.95, $48ish wth tax), we obviously liked it. Here's what I liked: tandori chicken- very flavorful, an itialian style baked chicken, bbq chicken, mashed potatoes-I think they were the best I've ever had at a restaurant, creamy & full of flavor, sourdough bread was soft-perfect wth butter, chicken fajitas-I should know this was good, I'm mexican, mushroom concotion- dnt know what its clld but that sh%$ was goooood, pizza-bothe the vegetable & pepperoni, vegetable eggrolls-just the right amt of spices, the ranch dressing-yes, the ranch is awesome, they have a tomato/mozzarella salad that was pretty good 2. Here's what I didn't like: no enchiladas in the mexican section-all they had was chkn or beef fajitas, mexican rice (it was ok), whole pinto beans, street tacos (they looked old) & a selection of salsas, guacamole, sour cream, etc. Next, the tortilla soup is more like a chunky, spicy tomato soup, not tortilla-although the flavor was good, its defin not tortilla. The chicken fingers were fatty- I took a bite & that was it, I cdnt even swallow that one. The chinese noodles were dry, blah. I was dissapointed in the location 2, its down the escalator below the casino, no natural light. Although the decor is nice, it was a little 2 dark 4 my liking. I am not a seafood person, so I can't rate that. I saw ppl eatin they crab legs, oysters & shrimp. They have several beef & pork selections, like bbq ribs & sm other stuff. But again I ddnt try those so } can't rate them. I dnt know if I wd pay the regular lunch or dinner prices though, get the pass, I think its a btr deal. My frnd & I were able to get 3 meals out of it, pretty good at $48 for the strip. Lastly, the desserts, hmmmm? Ummm, not much of a selection, all cupckes pretty much. They do have tons of flavors though & the ones I tried were pretty awesome. They also have a crepe section, but a small selection of what goes in the crepes. Also, a self serve soft ice cream machine. Enjoy! Oohhhh I almost 4got, the waiter we had yesterday was the nicest I've ever had. I ddnt get his name, but he had an accent. Cdnt tell where he's frm though :-(",

The eggs literally had water sitting in the bottom of the pan and were beyond mushy and some of the other food just didn't look appetizing. We ate here 2 mornings and one morning we got this humongous glass of OJ and the other morning we got a glass of OJ that was meant for a baby...pretty weird and trying to get our servers attention on the 2nd visit for refills was pretty impossible. The highlight of the buffet was the omelette station. You can pretty much customize what you want in it, and is made to order; the wait was only around 5 minutes for one. Honestly, the only reason we ate here 2 mornings was because we had coupons from staying at PH and it was cheaper than the cafe in the hotel. We were pretty selective on our tastings the 2nd trip though.",

Spice Market is by far my favorite Vegas casino buffet.  I mean, where else can you find, for under $30 for dinner (and you can easily score $5 off coupons if you stay or gamble at Planet Hollywood), already cracked in half crab legs (which they will happily steam for you if you prefer them hot), already peeled shrimp cocktail, prime rib, sushi rolls, freshly baked pizzas, a Middle Eastern section with tandoori chicken and lamb skewers and great vegetarian options, BBQ bun dim sum, freshly prepared crepes with your choice of toppings, big puffs of cotton candy, chocolate-covered strawberries, AND frozen custard from the soft-serve machine??  The only downside, IMHO, is that they only serve Pepsi and not Coke, but I admit I'm just being nit-picky about that...",

Going from 2 hours of sleep from a strip club can make a person hungry, but at the same time, satisfaction is another thing. I thought that for a Las Vegas buffet it was more so below okay, than it was good. Me and my buddy had the \"early\" breakfast buffet. I have to say that , with all of those different cuisine stations, you would think they would have different flavors, but for some reason it all tasted like well seasoned paper and mush. Maybe I was still drunk, maybe it was the glamour of being in Vegas, but as I believe it was.......I could have gone to the Red Rock Casino and gotten better quality for what I paid. I'm being very nice by giving 3 stars, due to fact that I may have been a little under the alcohol, but it wasn't a good experience none the less.",

My hubby and I went for dinner and I highly recommend getting the buffet pass for $45 (save $5 off $50 when you sign up for Total Rewards in the casino). We also added unlimited booze for an extra $12 pp. You can't beat this. It's all you can drink champagne, local beers plus Coronas and Heinekins, and wine. This is definitely one of my favorite buffets and has the best variety. There's Italian, Chinese, Mediterranean, Mexican, seafood, etc. My favorites were the Italian meatballs and spaghetti, crab legs, and the chocolate dipped strawberries. They have everything: pizza, prime rib, ham, ribs, veggies, rice, Mediterranean chicken, hummus... really too much to name and sure to please even the pickiest eater. My hubby really liked the spicy chicken tacos and the banana cream pie. The best part? They have big screen TV's everywhere and were playing the Canucks in the western conference finals. If you're a hockey fan, you'll understand the importance of this. We were there around 6:30 pm and waited for maybe 5 minutes. One tip - go during non-peak hours, before seven or after 9 to avoid the lines. Even better, start your buffet pass with a later dinner and finish off the next day with an early dinner and get 4 meals including 2 dinners!",

If you are the type of person that wants quantity over quality then this is probably your heaven and you should buy the day pass here and eat every meal of day here if you can. On the other hand, if you are a normal person you should probably go to a real restaurant and have 1 nice entree and be very satisfied with your meal. The selection is very diverse but all the food just is not up to the quality of that same item if you got it at a regular restaurant. The food was not bad, just not good. One positive to this is if you don't like something you can always go up and try one of the other 100 dishes that are out there at any given time. Also, the line for this place can get pretty bad, we waited roughly 20 minutes. So if you see a line just skip it and go to another restaurant there is no justification for waiting for this buffet.",

The Spice Market buffet is good like they say and was better than I expected.  I thought it to be about the same mid-level place around $28.   The Spice Market has a better variety packed with many well made items.  I enjoyed the Middle-Eastern island pantry even though I am not a big fan of ME foods.  It's ironic the ME food here at a buffet was better than all the ME restaurants I tried.  Loved those lamb and chicken kabobs, the hummus and bagooey or whatever that other dip was called and the stuffed grape leaves.  It was Monday night and they had King Crab legs that were as good as they get - moist and untainted with any additives.  Good, smokey BBQ pork ribs, and yummy shrimp & sausage jambalaya among other deliciously cooked items. I was so stuffed from trying all the different items before I got to the carvery that I did not even try the prime rib or other carvery items.  I figure, I will try it the next I come to Vegas.  I  won't hesistate to come here.  A delicious deal!",

Sunday brunch was ok. Came for breakfast Monday and that was ok. Service was ok. Set up and variety was ok. OK? Ok..",

We went here for the Memorial Day brunch/lunch special and I wasn't disappointed. $28 you get your selection of seafood, like Charlene R. wrote. crab lets, shrimp, oysters, etc. I'm not big on that stuff. However I can assure the seafood isn't bad, not super, but good enough for a buffet. The meat, some were good, some was a bit dry. I had the ends of the prime rib, so it was kind of dry. The brisket was very good. The rib was pretty tender off the bone good. Both meats, and mostly all the meats are pretty fatty. (that's how they get you!) The sushi bar is quite week. The Middle Eastern food is pretty good, I really like the grape leaf wrap (i forgot the name) is excellent. The asian food is standard to a tad below average. The dessert is very good. They have a banana fosters and a crepe bar, the crepe aren't made with much care, but it taste good enough. I enjoyed this place. Since I've never been to Bellagio, this place rates as my favorite, with maybe a nose above Rio.",

The real difference is the quality of the food. And here, it's not too shabby!! The crab legs are really good, juicy and fresh. They have italian, seafood, salad,soup, middle eastern, asian, and desserts. Their italian section would be bomb if they had a create-your-own pasta station like the Wynn or Mandalay. All the food was pretty good, but the salad bar was definitely lacking in the veggies department. 3 different types of greens, and then all they had were mushrooms, cucumbers, and like 2 other veggies. A little disappointing, but I guess you dont really go to a buffet for salad, right!!",

The mediterranean section is better at Paris Village buffet but they do have crepes to order here.  And also because it was Pacquiao fight weekend they had filipino egg rolls and tocino.

The staff was very friendly and the server was great about refilling our alcoholic beverages seeing as how we were going through them so quickly. The streamed crab legs with butter we my favorite.. that and some wine I was good to go. The prime rib was delicious as well nice and juicy. I tried some of the pasta as well it was just ok but I wasn't there for that anyways. The main thing was my glass was always full even when they got busy my server was always taking care of me. The place is clean and there's a BIG selection. Look on Groupon to see if you can get the deal we found because originally without it the dinner would have cost us around $110. Check this place out, I will be returning when I come to Vegas. The cupcakes aren't the greatest but what do you expect when they sit out for a while. The crepe I had was pretty delicious though.",

After the advice of one of the cab drivers, combined with the fact that one of our friends was already staying here, we decided to give this place a shot rather than going to the Rio Seafood Buffet that I usually go to.  Granted they did have bigger crablegs, they were cold, I like my crablegs to be hot, hot, hot!    The prime rib was so-so and their mashed potatos were flavorless.  Their middle-eastern stuff was all on the dry side and their sushi was very unoriginal.    The only redeeming quality of this place was the dessert section, but overall I wasn't impressed and will return to the Rio.",

    "text": "Before You read this I must say that I am the type of person that would much prefer a $50 plate of good quality food than $40 smorgasbord of mediocre food.  With that being said, there are a few things I expect from every restaurant, and one of those is CLEANLINESS.    I dined here with family in March for Sunday brunch at around 2pm.   While I must say, they do have a nice selection of food, especially desserts but I didn't expect to see bugs on the buffet.  Oh...and yes, I did say bugs, and by bugs, I mean a roach.  My wife was going to get food and she saw a roach crawling on the buffet in between food bins.  The lady manning the station saw the roach and in a very mechanical fashion covered the roach with a towel, threw it on the floor and stomped it out.  She had no sense of alarm which made me feel like this probably happens all the time.    I was at the table trying to enjoy my dessert (the cupcakes were fantastic...and the bread pudding was the best part of my meal) but my stomach was turned when my wife returned to the table to say \"Oh Lord...there is a roach!\"    To the credit of the restaurant, we went to the manager and our meal was comped immediately which I do appreciate, but I don't appreciate knowing that I might have consumed food that was tap danced on by bugs.  I would not return to this restaurant, but I must say that the manager handled the situation well, for what that is worth.",

I seriously would be in mourning if I couldn't go back!  no really, wearing black, crying, pulling out my hair, tearing the clothes...   As of my last visit last year, if you go for the \"slot tournament\" that's only ~$30 to play, you get a $10-$20 discount on the buffet, 100 pulls on one of a select choice of machines (if you get the highest scores, you win big!) and $15 or $20 to play at a regular slot (and you get to keep the winnings!).  Just for the fun of it and the discount on the buffet, it was worth it!  Not sure if it's around anymore, but may as well give it a try!

If you are a foodie, and you are actually interested in working your way around the whole buffet limiting yourself to a tablespoon of anything just so you can try it all-- The Spice Market Buffet is the best. I was particularly impressed by the Indian and Middle Eastern offerings-- their Tandori chicken was very good, and the falafel is as good as it gets.   Don't go there to stuff your face on the cheap-- that's not what this place is about (try Excalibur or some crap instead), check out the Spice Market when you really can't make up your mind and want to try a touch of everything.",

I ate here on a Friday night for dinner and paid $25 (regular price is $30, but upon check-in we got coupons for $5 off per person - up to 4 people).   There were Mexican, Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern, and American stations including a big Seafood & Dessert section. Maybe it's the fact that I wasn't really in the \"buffet\" mood that day or that I ate a baked potato - yes I know you shouldn't load up on useless carbs at a buffet but I LOVE baked potatoes :( Well needless to say I got full easily off the American, Italian, Asian, and Seafood stations that I never made it to the Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Dessert stations. There weren't too many dishes that stood out in my mind and I left having that \"this wasn't worth it\" feeling. The food was alright. Maybe if it was cheaper than $30 then I would have been happier. In addition, our server sucked. She never refilled our drinks. After we were seated, she cleared our plates once and we never saw her again.   Highlights of this buffet were the Cotton Candy (which my boyfriend and guy friend were ecstatic about. We even have a pic of my friend with a cotton candy mustache lol) and the Crepes, cause who doesn't love crepes!?",

At 10am they started to put up the breakfast items, which was strange for brunch. Mimosas were so disgusting. They did have a small omelet station with 4 pans. The chef was only making one omelet to completion before starting another. Several angry people in line. Desserts were all stale and even the ice cream was runny and tasteless. I could not even put it in the sugar cones. This experience should have foreshadowed the food poisoning I got. By 3 o'clock I had to lay down and did not wake up till 10pm to be physically ill. This was all that I had eaten and I washed my hands/ used hand sanitizer after playing machines. Bad service, bad choices and selection, poor quality, and the food makes you sick. Avoid! No buffet should be able to ruin breakfast. Attaching a pic of my burnt french toast.",

Desert selection was okay. They do offer a all you can drink (alcohol) on top of the ~23 dollars for about 12-13 dollars but I'm not a huge drinker so we opted out of that deal. If we did want this deal, we would have had to ask the server each time but I wonder if that would have been a problem because we haven't even met our server. In my opinion, it's better to take your money else where even if it means spending a few more dollars.",

Many of our favorite foods/dishes were missing and the remaining entrees were of poorer quality.  The staff was helpful and diligent but my group would not recommend this buffet to anyone.  We had received discounted  coupons after our visit and did not use them due to the poor selection and quality. Spice Market Buffet went from a 5 star experience to an 1 star dinner buffet.",

    "text": "Crabsssss. The seafood crabs and not the other one that you can potentially get in Vegas...  4 full plates of crabs, 3 prime rib, some other things and 4 mini desserts and a crepe. Yes I ate that all and I have Betsy S. as a witness. It was quite gross to see me eat all of that. Or maybe amazing if you see someone like me eat that much. The buffet food was okay, the crabs had no flavor though, so I make my own flavor sauce. I don't eat it with butter. I take a bunch of lemons and squeeze it out to make lemon juice and  then put some salt and pepper in the mix. That's all. Simple yet delicious. The prime rib was okay only when it wasn't well done.  When we went there wasn't a line, we beat the dinner rush and it was awesome! Overall it's not like your buffet at Bellagio or Wynn or anything. But it's pretty decent for the pricing especially if you join their membership you get like a 15% on your first buffet. Also there wasn't anything \"spice\" about this buffet.",

I wasn't even very hungry when we arrived, but the food was delicious, fresh, and well presented.  We had been in Italy last month, so starting at the Italian food section of the buffet was a bit risky; but I wasn't let down here either.  The green beans and Italian sausage with peppers were every bit as good as these dishes were in Rome and Orvieto, Italy!  The Mexican food was fantastic as well.",

Spice Market is located in Planet Hollywood, and is downstairs of the casino. There was a decent spread, and the Middle Eastern section was by far my favorite. There was an Asian section, an American Section, A South American Section, and the Mid-Eastern section. The Asian section offered spring rolls and noodles, American offered sliders, a Roast and Turkey, the South American had some Hispanic dishes with rice and tortillas, but my fave was the Curried lamb, couscous, and na'an bread. Honestly, I don't know if I'd have chosen this buffet if it weren't for the Groupon.   Our Groupon included all-you can drink wine or beer, so that was also a bonus. Definitely a nice buffet if you are feeling adventurous.",

I wanted to do one buffet that would be reasonable price for two people that will not eat a ton and more of a finicky 9 yesr old.  Looking at differences between lunch and dinner it was seafood paella and tandoori chicken vs. Chipino and lamb.  9 year old likes quite a few from rest of options, so made no difference to him.  I like tandoori chicken and both Chipino and paella. Chose lunch.   Well tandoori chicken was unbelievably wonderful but paella was very disappointing. Taste was good but it was almost 100 percent rice. I even waited until they brought out a fresh batch and it was same consistency.  All in all a fair price and no line at noon. I walked through Paris on way there and their buffet line was very long.",

The buffet is now smaller, which means less options, and the food definitely has gone downhill.  I've only come here for brunch and for a buffet it USED to be pretty good.  Between my husband and I trying several different foods, the only tasty items were the Yukon mashed potatoes and the flan dessert.  One star for that. The other star was for the friendly service.  I was totally left with feeling the need for redemption because I wasted my first meal of that trip coming here.  : (",

    "text": "Our $45.98 Groupon for \"two dinner buffets with unlimited drinks\" expired a few weeks ago but we used the paid value of it towards our meal. We bought the Groupon months ago with the intention to use it that day, but when we arrived there was a line all the way through the regular turnstile, up the escalator, and nearly out the door to the Miracle Mile Shops. We avoided this buffet for months, thinking it was this crowded all the time. We went Halloween night and there was NO ONE in line. I was told this was a \"slow\" season.  We are Total Rewards (players card) members and expected to pay $27.99 each, minus the Groupon credit. However, the \"NEW PRICING\" prices noted on the website menu <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1u7By0S&s=b875d92b16f7a87ce981b7899557e888a35b89e5ed5f346fa52ac54e7a6ac3fc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1u7By0S</a> were not the actual prices. The cashier said the prices increased, and in fact they increased a few hours before we arrived. Our new price for Total Rewards members was $29.99 plus tax. That was a bit disappointing, and we suggested they update the website immediately.  Total of $77.76 for buffet for two wasn't a great value overall (we get free buffets often at Silverton, The M, and Stations Casinos), but I suppose our fault for buying the Groupon not knowing the lines would be so long at the time we wanted to be there in the first place.  Service was good. Food selection was all good and tasty except for the baklava which was stiff. The chardonnay house wine was very cheap and sugary in my opinion. I would not do the all-you-can-drink next time. Better to buy a quality glass of wine in the casino and bring it in.  There was a photographer taking those \"tourist\" photos and trying to sell a pair of pics for $20. We didn't care for that, and we didn't appreciate that she assumed we were tourists. Locals like us are just as much of the clientele around this town.  If the price was lower and if they'd upgrade the house wine selection, we'd go again.",

Got into vegas late and was hungry, So checked in real quick at the Luxor and headed to PH to eat. My impression of the Buffet of Buffets is could go to the participating buffets, pay and get a card or wrist band. Was told rudely or bothered by an older filipino lady that I had to go up this way and turn that way to get a rewards card to eat there for the deal. All she did was get me lost cause she lead me know where. This security guy helped me find where i was suppose to go in the end, alot easier. So took care of that, went back down, paid and got our table.   I 1st tried the Seafood Station. The fish was pretty good. They had cajun tilapia, crab stuffed sole, panko battered shrimp and beer battered fish. They all had alot of flavor. There so called Paella was dry and lacked taste. Joe's Crab Shacks version is 10x better.   They had meat, cheese and cracker Station, Mexican and American station but none of it caught my attention.  The one that did was the Middle Eastern Station. They had kabobs of Tandoori chicken, Beef and Vegetables, Hummus, Babaganoosh, Naan bread and \"AWESOME\" Candied Figs. Couldnt get enough of them and everything else they had to offer. The guy knew what i wanted since i kept going back alot. lolll  The Desserts......ummmmm sucked. Only thing that tasted good was the Cotton Candy. It would be pretty hard to mess that up lolll  So needless to say I dont know if I will come back here unless im craving some Middle Eastern food. That was the only \"WIN\" about this place.",

For breakfast the place wasn't crowded so there was no wait.  There were more breakfast food options here than I've ever seen!  It really was an amazing spread and mostly everything tasted good.    There is also a lot of space for walking around and the tables aren't squished together like a lot of other buffets.  Not only was there a huge selection of good food, but the restaurant looks brand new and is nicely decorated.  There's a very pleasant atmosphere, everything was wonderfully clean, and the service was good.  We arrived for dinner at 8:30pm and there was a huge line to the point that they were about to turn people away for being near capacity.  We didn't feel like waiting so we paid an extra $20 a person to jump ahead of the entire line and use the VIP entrance.  I recommend doing this to avoid the long line.  We saved ourselves at least 30 minutes of waiting in line.  The dinner buffet had a ton of options.  Lots of seafood (try not to get a table near the seafood section because the smell was overwhelming and I felt bad for the people sitting there), Latin, Italian, and Mediterranean food, sushi, and so much more.  The dessert bar had cotton candy and the creme brulee was excellent.  I've been to almost every buffet on the strip and this is one of the best!",

Our table server was attentive and filled our waters and drinks pretty quickly.    The bad The restaurant was not exceptionally clean.  There were a number of tables that had not been cleaned and were waiting to be bussed. The restaurant has a strange layout.  The food is spread over a rather large area and broke into sections.  It gives a rather odd sense of not really knowing completely what is available.  The disappointing The food quality overall is just average at best.  There were a few things that were pretty good, however generally this buffet is similar to any international buffet in my hometown that you could go to for $15 or $20.  The crab legs were cold and clearly a smaller size than some of the other buffets in Vegas.  The sushi is terrible.  There was an abundance of low cost pasta dishes etc that fill you up, but are not very distinguishable etc.  Ultimately, my meal wasn't awful, however I wouldn't return.  I only get the opportunity to go to Vegas once in a while, during my limited time there I rather go to one of the premier buffets.  Clearly, those buffets are more expensive, however I left feeling disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity to eat at a nicer place.    This place would be ideal for broke college students trying to fill their stomachs as inexpensive as possible with cheap food and all you can drink.",

    "text": "After waiting in two separate lines, one to pay and another to be seated, for what seemed like forever, we were finally able to sample the food from the various ethnic stations. I believe there was a Mexican, Italian, Asian, Middle Eastern, American, Seafood, Soup and Salad stations as well as dessert. To keep this review on the shorter side I'll say that the food I tried from the various stations were all pretty good for the most part but there were one or two items from the various sections that I didn't think were that good compared to other places. The pork fried rice in the Asian area, was one let down. It had a weird taste and there was little to no pork in it at all. Definitely a dish that needs to be revamped. The pork buns were very delicious and for me, it was the highlight of the Asian area. Each station only has a few items to choose from which was pretty disappointing. I guess I just expected a little more variety from each station than what we were offered.   The dessert station was pretty nice in my opinion. The variety in this area was satisfying. There were various flavors of cupcakes as well as different mini cakes, pastries, tarts, cotton candy and even ice cream. There was so much I wanted to try but had to keep my sugar intake to a minimum. Most of the delicious treats they offered I just took a bite of just to say I tried it. There was something there to satisfy anyones sweet tooth for sure. Now back to the food stations for a sec. If I had to choose a station I enjoyed the most it would definitely be the Middle Eastern one. Most of the offerings at that station were just delicious! I had the tandoori chicken, lamb, beef kabobs, curry chicken and curry lamb and they were by far my favorites in the entire buffet. Oh, and the mac n cheese in the American section was the best i've had out of the two buffets I've visited in Vegas.    The service here was pretty good. Our server was great about keeping our cups filled and our empty plates off the table. Overall it was a satisfying experience and I would come here again in the future but they should definitely try to add a few more dish options in a few of the stations that were lacking.",

    "text": "Buffets.. A place to binge on almost any kind of food you can imagine. You would think almost every buffet on the Strip deserves a 4 or 5 star rating, but there are exceptions.  Let's start off with the fact that the waiting line is located super close to some of the dining areas. My group was seated near the entrance of the buffet and the line got ridiculously long that some of the people were standing right in front of us. Normally this wouldn't really be that much of a problem, but it does when they are standing in the way of me and my path to food.  Its your average buffet with food ranging from mediterranean to asian to mexican to seafood. I'm a seafood lover so I will ALWAYS find myself heading straight to the crab legs ;) What can I say? I want to get my moneys worth. This buffet has 2 small trays with crab legs =( It's quite depressing when I'm use to the World Carnival Buffet at the Rio having a HUGE selection on crab legs. I still found myself getting 2 plate servings though. If there's crab legs, I'm eating it.  Nothing else was really appealing to me. I had some of their 3-cheese ravioli which I found too heavy even for italian food. The pesto alfredo was alright - nothing worth raving about OR putting down. I guess the last thing I can add about this place is it is poorly lit. It's a little dim for my liking, but that's a personal preference.  All in all, this buffet may just be a pass for me. There are better buffets out there with higher quality in food and bigger selections.",

We did not know what expect, especially that we went to Caesars palace buffet the night before and were so disappointed. Here, it was not super busy but selection was very good, a lot to choice from, and excellent , excellent quality of food and bakery!!!!! My husband is peaky eater, and normally at buffets he leaves food that he does not like. This time, his plates were empty!!!! Meat has been done perfect !!!! Crab legs were very good, so is seafood in general!!! We liked it a lot, so the morning before we left Vegas, we stopped there for breakfast!!! It was another winner!!! Smoothes, selection of different type of eggs were great. Crepe station and bakery were excellent. Omelets were super!!! My favorite is eggs with spinach &mushrooms, omg, taste of heaven.     :)",

    "text": "Used to be my favorite until Wynn Buffet opened up.  Went back this past weekend for the Sunday brunch since we had time to kill before our flight.  Once we got there around 1pm we had to wait for about 40 minutes, which is a good thing IMO.  I was afraid quality going down since the last time I came was 2 years ago but crowd is a good sign.  Got in, and was surprised to find that the Sunday brunch was less than $30!  They have all the usuals: carving station with prime rib, seafood, American, Mexican etc.  Our favorite, surprisingly, was the spicy tuna roll!  I was skeptical when I first tried it but the surprising kick drew me in.  The rest of the table tried it and I think we must've killed over 20 of them as a table hahah.  The crabs were great since they were cracked in half for you.    Tried the turkey and prime rib at the carving station.  Both were pretty good, but nothing too crazy about them.  Great au jus for the prime rib and they offered both creamed and smooth horseradish on the side.  At around 4pm, they started switching to dinner and they had this bacon pork belly at the carving station as well.  A little salty but not bad.  As for the Asian food section, again, nothing too crazy but I did like the BBQ pork bun.  There's also a Mid-Eastern section with hummus, tandoori, and others.  It's a nice change from the American and breakfast food items :P  The dessert section had a lot of different mousses and cakes, but my favorite was definitely the creme brulee.  Not served during lunch/brunch, but since we stayed long enough for the dinner service, they had creme brulee out.  The soft serve machine was down so I didn't get a chance to grab anything :[  In the end, I was pleasantly surprised that Spice Market Buffet was still good after all these years.  I remember when this place was the shiet and even with the new buffets popping up, serving \"higher class\" buffet items, Spice Market is doing a good job!",

    "text": "This was our middle buffet on the Buffet of Buffets 24 hour tour.  As such, we didn't want to go crazy because we knew we were going to destroy the offerings at the Rio later on that day.  This place was definitely a step up from the Le Village buffet at Paris, which we had visited the night previously.  What I really liked about this particular buffet is that they have clearly defined cuisines at each station.  There was Mexican, Mid-Eastern, Italian, American, and Asian.  Now I know they have those food selections at most buffets, but because they were self contained islands of food, they were all well stocked with a variety of foods True to their region of the world.    We didn't over-eat at this one (I know, what a shame!), but of the food I tried I was pleasantly surprised.  The standout selection for me was the Prime Rib, which is typically something I pass on at buffets (sorry, a slice of Prime Rib can take up a lot of valuable real estate in my stomach), but at the advice of my friend I went for a slice.    The Prime Rib here was slow roasted and cooked perfectly.  It was so tender it nearly melts in your mouth.  There was also a tasty spice rub on the outside that made you want to trim the edges off and parcel it out so that you can combine a little bit with each bite.  And to top it off the Au Jus was equally amazing.  Good job Spice Market!",

The selection here is fantastic and just about everything I've ever had here is good. Breakfast is one of my favorite times here - the selection is great, they make some killer smoothies, and I can have every different kind of juice imaginable if I want to - and sometimes I do! The coffee here is divine - possibly the best drip coffee in all Vegas.  Lunch and dinner are a little pricey, but you can find some coupons on the internet that knock the price down $5 (just search \"spice market buffet coupons\"), which makes it a little more reasonable. Also, if you get in right at the end of breakfast (which is cheaper and runs until 10:30 am), you can hang around until they bring the lunch goods out. I'm going back to Vegas in 10 days (not that I'm counting) and you can bet I'll be moseying up to this buffet right around 10 am on my first day in town.",

So we said we are three families and don't mind sitting at separate table just in the same location and the hostess said no and sat us in three different corners. When our third family arrived and went to sit in the reserved table the supposedly manager named Marjorie made a big fuss about about our seating, wanting to charge us the gratuity still, as she carried the utensils in her hands to see where we were seated.  After she confirmed that we weren't all sitting together she shoved the 5 napkin wrapped utensils in my hands and made me carry them myself to our table. To boot, the waitress came once to bring us our first drink and was never seen again until she saw we we ready to leave...and for this sage wanted 18.75% tip?

Food is always good, you're not going to be disappointed when dining here!  They have different stations like every other buffets! Food is amazing! Dessert station is good! Def a stop when you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "Crab legs, check. Pot Roast, check. Burritos (you have to make them yourselves), check. Kung Pao Chicken, check. Overpriced buffet, 3/4 of a check. :D  Went here on a Saturday and it was heavily packed with many people, families, cheerleaders (the cheerleader competition was going on in the weekend I was in Vegas), and heavily dressed people.  My friend desperately wanted to go and they were having a sale where if you check into Facebook, there's a Pay One Person, Get Another Person Free deal.  AWESOME!!! I totally would have not gone if this deal wasn't there.  The price for ONE person is $30 and that's not worth it to me.  But, because of the deal, I would go again just for all the awesome food they have!! :D",

    "text": "I would come back here again.  Just don't make this buffet your last buffet for the Buffet of Buffets especially if you're in a time-crunch.  I came here with about 40 mins left on my 24-hour Buffet pass and almost didn't make the cut because the line was long and it took them forever to seat everyone, even though there were TONS of tables on the seafood side.  Unfortunately for me, because of the Buffet of Buffets, I wasn't that hungry.  But it's ok because seafood doesn't really fill you up.  So I went on an all out crab legs binge.  I do love the crab legs there: snow crab (which means those large crab legs with huge pieces of meat and not the scrawny ones you normally see in crappy buffets) and they're cut in half so you can easily extract the meat from the legs.  Yummmmm....  The shrimp cocktail is also peeled for you so that's a plus since I can't stand peeling shrimp.  As for the prime rib, I really didn't pay that much attention to it.  I had 1 slice and I still don't think it's as good as Paris' Le Village Buffet's prime rib.  Our server was decent and pretty attentive.  I found the Usher/hostess ladies a bit on the grumpy side though since we heard them yelling at a couple who prematurely sat at the booth she was going to take them to anyway.",

    "text": "This buffet was the best one we went to with our 24 hour pass in Vegas. The buffet had a huge variety and all we had was fresh. On the weekends you can get free champaign during brunch...and they kept your glass filled! My favorite parts of this buffet were the Mediterranean and dessert sections. I had way too many desserts, but they were all worth every calorie!",

    "text": "Voted #1 Buffet for 6 years and it was in the hotel we were at for a conference. Why not? My husband and I don't normally like buffets but we decided to give it a shot. For the some 30 dollars a person it should've been amazing, but it was horrible. I don't think either of us found anything we liked at all except for the desert. The food was beyond bland. The voters who rated it number one must have been the elderly who hate seasoning!",

    "text": "I don't know what all the nasty reviews are about. I'm giving it 5 stars for food but 3 stars for service. The food was so good I'm willing to deal with the lousy service. I've never been to the buffet at The Rio, which some here said is better, but when I was at this buffet, I was in heaven. As I walked from station to station I just drooled. Then I ate each dish and was blown away. Virtually everything was delicious.   They offered Asian, American, seafood, Italian, salad bar, and a dessert bar. I'm certainly forgetting 1 or 2 of them. Never seen that many islands for one buffet of any kind... anywhere.  The price is far from a deal ($23-$25); however, it really doesn't cost any more than a good meal would anyway. For about $50, you can get 24 hour access to the buffet down to the minute. So stop by at 2 pm for a late lunch and get 4 meals in without feeling the need to stuff your face each time.  The salad bar was not quite as good as it could have been given how much they have of everything else, but certainly not awful as someone else indicated.  As far as the service is concerned, you'll see a waitress once to bring your beverages and they'll bus your plates away, but that's about it.  Overall it was one of the most amazing culinary experiences ever. Go here!",
