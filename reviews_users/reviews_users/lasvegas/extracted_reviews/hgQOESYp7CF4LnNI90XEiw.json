    "text": "Staff was friendly and helpful.  As for the pizza itself, meh. Saw a review stating they were too thin in the middle and my husband and I both agree about that opinion. We both chose the margherita base, minus the basil for my hubby, he needn't have bothered as mine had all of 2 leaves. Where the dough was thicker it was really good, however the middle is so soggy I gave up after 3 slices. My hubby ate a couple of mine but the crust was so burnt that's really all I tasted. It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place. At $36 for our whole  meal, 2 pies, a soda, tap water and a glass of tap wine it's not a bad deal. Just really wanted my lunch to taste better. Our pies were cooked together and my husbands crust wasn't  burnt.",

    "text": "I had been dying to try 800 degrees at the SLS and finally had a free day to get there.  I was not disappointed.  the Pizza was perfect,  the salad was yummy and the service was fast and courteous and friendly.    My friend had a pre-assorted mushroom truffle pizza.  And although truffle oil is not my favorite, her and other of my friends who like truffle, rave about it.    I made my own, with the Bianca white base (I requested no garlic as I don't care for it).  The Bianca is olive oil, mozzarella, oregano and garlic normally.  Then I added, a raw egg, grilled chicken and fresh basil.  OMG it was out of this world!  Cooked perfectly with my egg just right with a little runny yolk to dip in, but no runny whites.  The crust was perfect blend of slightly crispy but soft, not burnt.   I've eaten at Novacento several times and this 800 Degrees crust is 1000 times better.  its more fluffy and light and easy to bite.  The toppings also seemed fresher and lighter and they have more base sauce options.    We shared the small $5.00 Gorgonzola salad.  Its quite large for a $5 salad and the butter lettuce and toppings of cranberries, feta, and walnuts were great.  The dressing was light and fresh and one of the best I've had.    There was easily accessible nice glass plates and real silverware (not plastic), and pre-made to go boxes for left overs.  They thought of everything, for a quick, affordable nice experience.  My only tiny complaint is,  clean the empty tables faster so you don't have to select an open table based on what is clean,   and level the table feet on any tables that are wobbly.  When we were done, the pizza chef made a point to confirm if we were happy and everything tasted good.    If you're a vegas local, one sunday a month is 50% off for locals.  A must do!",

I had just got out of Life nightclub, just in case you were wondering. It was $15 cocktail night at Life LOL I was almost broke from buying all those drinks at the club so it was nice to find some value at SLS at 800 degrees. I spent $11 for my pie and took it back to the room to my half naked lady friend. I had to eat before we got it in. Can't bone on an empty stomach or near half dead from binge drinking. Of course the pizza was her idea. she was faded and if she wants pizza before the act of committing adultery than cool. Right? LOL this really was the case. Anyhow, I was happy I ate the pizza naked with her and I will definitely be back with clothes on. Holla.",

The only drawback is that we had wished our crust was a little crispier. When we ordered we had asked for the crispy thin crust and the guy making the dough said \"it's all thin crust.\"  He was wrong. Maybe he has never had crispy, thin crust pizza?",

I'm into a more light crunch, delectable, high end type of pizza. Maybe pizza regulars don't like that, but I do. And this hit a home run on my spot  I custom ordered my pizza with pepperoni, arugula, anchovies and mozzarella. They tend to skimp on all the ingredients, including the crust being thin... But the quality, damn, the quality is real. The flavor is masterful and the oil brushed on top is intensely pure. Don't forget the dash of salt that is savory  I loved this pizza and will be back again",

The experience was just taken down several notches by the disorganized staff and simply lengthy process getting the food.   It's not all that obvious what you should do when you walk in. There's a couple of people making pizzas that logically looks like you might need to order there. The first register is apparently where you're supposed to order but you'd never know that until you're told. There was no staff member at the second register for a good 5 minutes and the beer I wanted was out.  Update Aug '16: I've been back. They've fixed most of the service issues.

This place blows them away. I only hope this place survives the rebranding of the Monte Carlo. The greatest improvement came when they changed from a few dollops of mozzarella to smaller chunks. Makes for better coverage of the cheese. This last time, mine could have used another 30 seconds in the oven - a few chunks of cheese didn't quite melt, but otherwise tasty. Don't forget the staff - I was engaged by 5-6 employees each one was pleasant, friendly and helpful. I recommend you give it a shot.",

First time I had the margarita pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. The second time I had the verde (pesto) with gorgonzola cheese and chicken. They were both amazing but I kinda liked the pesto one a little more.   The concept is very unique. You go down the line and chose your \"base\" which is the sauce. Then you can choose from their specialty menus which has toppings pre-selected of you can just pick your own. The open up a ball of dough right in front of you, and they dont use pre-shredded mozzarella. They use fresh mozzarella balls and tear it up and put it on the pizza right then and there. It takes some time to bake of course but its really good pizza and hits the spot!!! You can easlly get a pizza for less than 10 bucks. Its a personal pizza and i polished mine off in one sitting but for the light eater, 2 people can easily share 1 pizza.  Very good!",

There was absolutely nothing impressive about it and I would not have paid more than five dollars for the whole thing. This is not a pizzeria we plan on coming back to and are very disappointed by the poor quality of the pizza. It had some cheese and some tomato sauce and barely any basil. It had a thin crust but the crust was soggy. Extremely disappointing and would not recommend this to anyone. Getting one star because for the price of the pizza with the poor quality, just not worth it.",

I got pesto, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives.  Hubbs got marinara, pepperoni and sausage.  Both pizzas were good and not soggy, even after the long ride home.  Mine was salty but it was my own fault.  I wasn't thinking.  The mushrooms were marinated, that plus the kalamata olives really put it over the top salty.  It was still good just a little much.  800 degrees is a good deal even without the discount.",

We had a $25.00 food and beverage credit with our reservation.  So ya, 2 birds, 1 stone.  So let me say our pizza(s) were good.  Ordered 2, but we could have gotten away with 1 and then a salad.  My husband ate the rest of his after our night out though...lol!  800 Degrees is kind of pricey since all toppings that aren't on their limited menu of \"pre-designed\" pizzas are $1.50 per item.  Good pizza, but nothing that I'm dying to have again.",

    "text": "I've been to the one in the SLS twice, the first time was incredible. I ordered a gluten free pie, the girl asked me if I was celiac, I said yes and she proceeded to clean all the surfaces, change her gloves and prepare my pie. She notified the baker that the next pizza was celiac and both of them insured me that the oven would be wiped down as well... I ordered a Margherita base with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was divine.  The second time, this evening I went down to order the same thing, before I packed for my trip home in the morning. I asked for the gluten free crust, I instantly knew that it wasn't going to be the same. The first guy nodded at my request and started preparing my crust, not once asking if I was celiac at this point even at the risk of intestinal distress I wanted to see how far they'd go before any consideration was taken with the possibility of cross contamination.  He did not change his gloves, then passed it on to the next girl who also did not change gloves and looked utterly annoyed with her life in general and didn't add the drizzle of olive oil that's supposed to be on the marg base. She passed the pizza on to the baker who fiddled with the crust (same gloves). Then put the guy behind me's pizza in first... Slid it across the bottom then put mine in right in front. Then she fiddled with it constantly and still managed to burn the crust to ash. She missed a cut, so i had two double-size slices that were awkward to eat.   The service the first time was amazing, the second time was the worst. Despite cross-contamination I still ate it (I was starving) with the aid of Gluten Cutter and still not an optimum solution. I could have mentioned I was celiac on my own, but I was blown away by the complete disregard for potentially debilitating food allergies I couldn't bring myself to do it like looking away from a train wreck.   Thanks 800 Degrees for assuming that everyone ordering a gluten free pizza is doing it because it's the latest fad, rather than something medically necessary.",

They usually know what tehy are doing.  Starting simple, I decided on a Pepperoni on a crispy crust.. which wasn't the best idea.  The crispy crust was pretty soft on the first look. Lifting the first piece half of the slice bend down and the topings fell onto my plate. There was nothing crispy about this pizza at all.  At the end there were more topping leftovers on my plate than in my stomach. The pizza was overall wet and soggy. Probably due to too much tomato-sauce and fat from the mozzarella and salami.",

Quattro Formaggi with Sausage - fresh mozzarella, garlic, oregano, olive oil with Smoked Provolone, Parmigiano Reggiano, Gorgonzola, Fontina Zucca - fresh mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, garlic, oregano, olive oil, butternut squash, caramelized onions, bacon, rosemary oil Margherita DOC - Mozzarella di Bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Basil  Located in the SLS, with a second local found outside The Monte Carlo at the other end of The Strip, it was largely an effect of travel and an ever expanding local 'to-do' list that had prevented me from visiting 800 Degrees until Saturday but armed with a $30 off $60 coupon provided by The Code for my birthday it was with a friend I sat down within the languishing casino, our 6:30 arrival seeing more than half the table games without a dealer and nearby restaurants Katsuya and Cleo less than 1/8 full.  Conceptualized by Adam Fleischman, the man behind Umami Burger and a growing empire of restaurants rolling out in the Golden State as well as parts East, the heart of 800 Degrees is the wood burning oven and capable of turning out a Neapolitan Pie in less than two minutes with any number of artisan toppings for under $15 it was only after careful deliberation that our selections were made, the $60 tab proving far tougher to target with just two diners than one would imagine but three pies and two sides achieving the goal with a glass of wine and iced tea to boot.  Exemplifying the 'quick casual' counterside ordering concept overtaking much of America's mid-range dining culture these days, but left to collect items from the cashier when a number is called out, it was perhaps an unfortunate aspect of the size of our order and a few parties following us that the pacing of our meal was marred by having to stand up from the table thrice to gather the goods, but once everything was finally obtained one would be hard pressed to find fault in the quality of any of the cuisine served - a first bite of creamy burrata and beets tinged in balsamic speaking of high quality sourcing soon to be found in each of the oven-singed plates.  Obviously focused on the pizzas, but happy to partake in charred balls of meat slightly smaller than a Titleist or Ping, suffice it to say that the four tender orbs were amongst the city's best for the price and with plenty of brightly acidic sauce left-over for dipping of crust it was onward to the Margherita DOC that our tasting progressed, each cherry tomato bursting with flavor beneath a bit of salt while milky mozzarella bubbled atop the smoky, pliable crust.  Said by some to be too 'wet,' but in reality a near-textbook rendition of the traditional Neapolitan pie, it was next in two 'Bianca' style discs that we sank our teeth and topping the Quattro Formaggi with a bit of crumbled sausage the smoke and savory composition sang, a similar bit of praise to be levied on the oft-praised 'Zucca' that matched tender butternut squash to briny bacon with caramelized onions and topnotes or rosemary tickling the palate in each and every bite.  No more expensive than Settebello, despite its Las Vegas Boulevard locale, and featuring far better ingredients than most 'artisan' pizzerias located throughout the 702 those looking for a top quality Neapolitan pie at a fair price would be well advised to check out 800 Degrees - one of those rare 'chains' doing things right, a rarity to say the least.",

Honestly, this place reminded me of a Chipotle. You start with a base and build your pizza based on fresh ingredients and you watch it come together before your very eyes.  I was most impressed with how quickly the pizza cooked. This place prepares all of its pizzas in an 800 degree brick oven, hence the name 800 Degrees! Cue aha moment!   My only criticism is that the crust is very very thin and made it challenging to keep all the toppings on top of the pizza. Next time I visit I am going to have the mozzarella melted on top of the toppings in hopes of keeping them in place on the crust.  In terms of cost and value it is one of the better deals you can get in Vegas. My sister and I split a 12-inch round pizza (three slices apiece) and spent $20. I was pleased.",

You will likely need to use a fork to consume your pie. Go ahead and Google \"NEAPOLITAN pizza\" if you don't believe me, I'll wait.  Now that you know what to expect, you can disregard all of the reviews posted by those who didn't. The walk-up ordering counter leaves something to be desired in terms of service. Their featured pies should be better, considering they're featured. Don't waste time on the salads or \"small bites\", but take note of the burrata options: beet, artichoke/olive, tomato/pesto, and prosciutto/melon. Unexpectedly well executed.  Unless you want a Margherita pizza, most other styles here will not have sauce- I personally prefer the Verde style with pesto, add mushrooms and/or truffle cheese and/or prosciutto if you like. If you're feeling especially adventurous, try the BLT, with bacon jam, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. It's a very confusing party for your mouth.",

I chose the pesto pizza and added sun dried tomatoes and bacon.  Good choice of additional add on's.  I really liked the mozzarella cheese they tore up to put on the pie, I think that is really the only cheese to use on a pie, unlike the \"pizza cheese\" a lot of places use.  After building, the pie is cooked in a wood burning oven and is typlcally ready in a minute or two after going in the oven so overall, once you start the building the process the pie should be in available more or less by the time you pay.

Will prob go out of business in a year or two. Your better off getting pizza from Paris hotel where its hot and tasty and busy. Or in the front of planet hollywood where pizza is better than here and customer service much better. This pizza place is as dull and slow like mid day. Never bringing or recommending to anyone. My son after a bite said, this pizza sucks! About 15 bucks a personal pan, not even worth it. Targets personal pan pizza hut way better",

Different choices of crusts (including a gluten-free crust), sauces, and toppings. Lots of options you don't often find.  Service is quick. Each time I've been here, by the time I've paid, my pizza is ready.",

Let me tell you this, they make the bestest pizzas. My son who is a picky toddler ended up eating 3 slices each time, that is a big win to me and a True testimony of the fact that the pizzas here send you on a pizza nirvana. I am taking away one star as when we went the second time the place was packed, we had to find a table that was not yet cleaned and had a pile of dirty dishes on it. The waiter kept asking us if it was our table, I insisted at least thrice that it was not our table and we were waiting to get that cleaned. Finally he cleaned it, so all is forgiven.",

In actuality, it took longer than expected for the pizza designers to build each individual pizza. Everything costs extra money. I ordered a meatball pizza and he crumbled two small quarter size meatballs on the pizza. I asked for extra and he said he would have to charge an extra $1.50. Ridiculous!  My bill with no alcohol for a 4 pizzas was over $60.   I guess what upset me the most was paying that much for pizza that tasted bad. None of our pizzas were cooked all the way thru. I asked customers in the table next to us and they also said their pizzas were soggy in the middle. Yuck! Not coming back, ever!",

There are some other limited options to choose from if you do not want pizza.  My son created a pizza with bacon, smoked Parmesan and mozzarella cheese that we shared. It amounted to 3 small pieces, which if you thought about it was probably equivalent to one piece of normal sized pizza.  They deliver the food to the table you select. The bad, it is super over priced for what you get. I would not recommend it on that fact alone. The price point is way high in their favor. You would think they would have you rather spend the cash on gambling, nope.",

I also needed something to give me a full stomach before going out for a night of old lady debauchery (which is more exciting than you think!).  As with most places, you can make your own pizza or select a specialty pizza.   If I'd been feeling more experimental, I'd have tried the Verde base which is pesto sauce with mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano , but I went for the traditional margherita base with crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil and basil.  (There is also a white base and a no-cheese marinara base.)  From there, you select your toppings, and there are plenty to choose from.  I went with salami (they were out of soppressata *wail*) and peppadews (yum!)  The pizza cooks in seconds because of the thinness of the crust, and it came out hot and delicious!  It was a great portion size - about 10 inches, and I inhaled it.  It was just what I needed.   Service was fast and friendly, and as a price point, it's Vegas and in a hotel, so it was $55 for three people to have their own pizza and a soda.   Yelp 100 #14",

    "text": "Get the Tartufo pizza!!  It is sooo good!  It's truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.  A lot of people were ordering a pizza for each person in their party, but one pizza was more than enough for two of us girls.  (It's comparable to a personal size pizza at Grimaldi's, which is smaller than a small.)  The Caesar salad was good too and the small was enough for the both of us.  They've got gelato too but you can pass on the gelato.  What does it take to get some good dessert at SLS? :p  For those who have never been here before, the ordering system is like that of Subway.  You stand in line and place your pizza order, and as you walk down, before you pay at the register, you can place an order for salad/appetizers.  For those with a sweet tooth there is a separate counter/register where you can order gelato.  There is a drinks/condiments/silverware area, and you pick you seat, and leave your plates for the workers to bus.  Be prepared for the food line to move slowly and the pizza to take a little bit of time to cook.  While you're waiting, look up at the ceiling - you'll see some interesting scenes :)    I wasn't planning on eating here, but the rainy weather prompted us to stay and eat at the hotel.  I'm glad we ended up at 800 Degrees - the food turned out to be delicious!",

I like my pizza to be erect when I put it in my mouth.\" Yes, it's a little disconcerting for me to hear him talking about putting erect things in his mouth, but that's not the point of this review, so I'll move on.  I actually didn't think it was that bad, I got the spicy meatball one and it was very spicy indeed. I picked off most of the jalapenos. My husband got the one with honey on it...something about a bee and he hated it. He said mine was marginally better. It was really spicy too, I don't think he was expecting that.  However, we both agreed that the truffle cheese bread we got was very good, albeit expensive. That was another one of my husband's issues he thought it was way too expensive for pizza. I will admit the price of almost $60 for 2 small pizzas, a cheese bread and 2 beers does seem rather high, but let's face it, nobody goes to Vegas to save money.  Would I go back? No probably not as it did not thrill me with sparkles and rainbows, but I'm not harboring a grudge against it like my husband is...I'll save that for the 3 card poker table that stole $100 from me in three hands!

This time around, I came because my friends and I were looking for food before our race and because we got 10% off for running the Rock and Roll Half Marathon.  The restaurant is located to the left if you are coming in through the front doors.  The place was pretty empty but then again we came around 2pm on a Sunday.  i saw the words arugula and truffle and immediately knew I wanted the Tartufo.  I asked for half roasted garlic and half minced garlic.  The pizza was decent.  Nothing too special. I liked the garlic flavor with the whole cloves of garlic but it was still pretty plain.  The other pie we got was the Zucca because I saw the words butternut squash.  Unfortunately, they ran out of squash so the server allowed us to substitute corn.  Not a one for one substitution but it was pretty good.  The pizza was sweet and savory with the corn and bacon.  I say it was better than the Tartufo because of the combination of flavors.  The place is good for a quick meal but nothing too impressive.  The pizzas are also pretty expensive when you think of the other fast food, build your own pizza places that are off the strip. Also, you have to pay for extra toppings.  800 Degrees is more high class than the other pizza shops but I don't the $1.50 per additional topping justifies the cost. Would be back but I might just head over to Umami instead...",

The crust is bland and I think would be better if it were a little more crispy. The red sauce is bland so I didn't feel like our pizza had much flavor. I am spoiled by pizza in the northeast so I'm sure it varies by an individuals palate preference. We also had a large Caesar salad which was perfect for sharing.

The portions are decent but I have been able to finish an entire pizza myself because of the thin nature of the pizza.  The salads are made fresh as well as the pizzas which makes me coming back to this spot over and over.  Open late till 2 am I believe makes it a great late night spot to dine with friends or solo for a quick bite. The option to create your own pizza is a plus but their selection of pizzas all sound amazing.  Make sure to try the different combinations of pizzas, definitely a place to check out at the SLS!",

    "text": "I'll go with a 3.5 rating rather than a 4, but because the flavors were so outstanding I'll bump them up to the flat 4.  Service was confusing, not in a bad way, in a \"everything looks and sounds like I want to cram all of it in my mouth right now\" way.  Too bad they have the entire fixins laid out in front of you which propelled me to add sausage to the quattro formaggi.  That much cheese...this kid needs some meat to make the magic work and I anticipated saltiness which some sweet sausage might help balance but more on that to come!  We ordered 2 apps and 3 pizzas.  The first to arrive were the Quattro Formaggi and the Zucca.  The Zucca was the one my dining partner heard about and it was \"a must.\"  It looked gorgeous and I decided to nosh that one first.  Well played and well ordered.  Fresh mozz, butternut squash, caramelized onion, bacon...SCORE!!!  If I remember correctly neither of us even knew there was bacon on it, but if you say bacon I put on facepaint and a loin cloth and dance around an open fire gratefully praying to pagan gods.  True story.  No it's not, but close.    The flavors were fantastic.  FAN-TASTIC.  So much so I completely ignored the fact it was fairly oily, and incredibly limp.  Limp as in pick it up and it droops down like grandpas brown polyester pants.  My grandpa doesn't wear those but I heard yours does!  Heeey-oooh!  All said and done this pie was tops, disregarding my very recent nitpicking and douchebaggery.  Next I put on my water wings and dove into the quattro formaggi WITH sausage.  If salt had a fist I just got punched by it.  I am not down, by any means, with this consistent socially acceptable wave of,\"Salt, salt, salt, salt\" BUT.....this was saltiness from mucho cheese and I mucho like mucho cheese.  If it was the plain pie as is, I'm not sure if I would've enjoyed it as much.  We had the sausage which helped plenty, but, I think, to send it over the top, possibly some pepperoni and/or chili flakes to add some heat or pepper to counteract that wonderful cheese and make a harmonious balance of divinity would've been the best choice. As the previous pie, oily and limp.  But taste made up for it.  The meatballs and the Margherita came out.  Meatballs....maaaaaaan...the meatballs came out in a little silver whatchamadoodle, like straight out of the oven.  Gorgeous bright red marinara (the sauce, btw, killer) and the tops of the balls were burnt, not brown, but black, and that black....ooooh boy, I'm telling you.  Sent dem balls to the stratosphere...as in the sky, not the hotel/casino.  Meatballs are outrageous and a must order.  MUST ORDER!!!  The Margherita had enormous bits of tomato.  Multi colored and quartered.  This one, also, unfortunately, limp and soggy, but like the others, flavor stood out more.  And now the sad part of our story.  I made the mistake of trying the burrata last.  After I ate enough to lose some interest in food.  In this was a great folly.  The burrata was something I would've enjoyed leaps and bounds more if I ate it first as I was supposed to.  Luckily, I'm still alive and can do things properly on my next go.    I loved the hotel and this is a great place for grab n go dinner or lunch.  Texture fails but taste dons body armor with shield and sword and wins out.  Definitely on the cheaper side as well.  3.5 to a 4.  Can't argue with the place.",

There were a couple of people in front of us, though with the set up, we were all moved through quite quickly.  We opted to create our own as I don't eat pork. The meatballs are all beef and so we went for meatballs and ricotta. Nice and easy. Everything was made right in front of our hazy eyes and cooked quickly. I believe it was ~$15 and was more than enough for the two of us to share. I liked the chili oil/sauce that was provided as it gave it a nice kick. The middle of the pie was a bit saggy but nothing to be concerned about. We just folded our slices and were good to go.  Prices are right and this is a good, quick option. Another excellent restaurant visit at the SLS!",

They do have a large variety of toppings and each coast $ 1.50 (but be ready to get just few pieces on the pie). The crust was tasteless and soggy in the middle. It even didn't hold my five half olive pieces. The sauce was not good either.  Overall, I found the pizza absolutely nasty and with no taste. The price seemed too high for what I got.

Granted I visited right after the SLS first opened, so some of my comments might be a little outdated.  The seating is far more cafeteria style than the LA locations, and I could see how things could get a bit tight if there's a crowd. It's also totally open to the gambling floor, which depending on who you are can be a good or a bad thing.  I have to say that the pizza was made perfectly, the employees were friendly, the entire place was spotless, and the biggest improvement from the LA location was a lack of rushing. This location really allows you to enjoy the experience.",

Pretty much like a Blaze Pizza or Pieology but this place came off a little more high end. You get to see the dough process turning from ball to crust and adding all the toppings thereafter. We ordered the Carni which had bacon, pepperoni, and ham. Best choice ever! All the meat toppings were spectacular! With your check in you also get a sample of their gelato.

The spicy sauce is very spicy, so try a little before you dump it on your pie. The service from the guy making the pizza was terrible, he was pretty rude and made it known we were the customers who were standing between him and his lunch break.

The lady at the table next to us got the kale salad to which she realized was summer mix. She went to talk to them and they told her they ran out of Kale. They hadn't t bothered to tell her and still charged her the higher price. We got the pizza and beer special for $10.95 but our total was $14. I think that is because they gave us an option of beers and we must have picked a more expensive one and they upcharged is without informing us. Good pizza, crappy staff.

My friend ordered the specialized Tartufo pizza which is a white pizza with truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula. I'm not a fan of eating whole cloves of garlic so tossed those aside.  The SLS Hotel is out of the way from the center of the main strip, but it's easy to get around on the monorail.",

We decided on the sausage & peppers pizza, Italian sausage, peppadews, carmelized onions. $12.15  My friend had eaten here previously and mentioned the only thing is that the pizza is often soft and not as cooked towards the center.  My friend was correct, the pizza was much more crispy towards the crust and a bit limp and soggy in the center. The pizza was good however, I feel they skimped out on the sauce, cheese and toppings. I am sure you can asked for extra or double for an extra charge but why should I have to?  I tasted mostly sauce and dough in most bites, the cheese was skimpy.  Anyhow, it was cool, I tried it and may visit on a 50% off locals Sunday night. I also enjoy that the SLS has one selected restaurant each Sunday that is 50% off for local diners.  I did enjoy how you can see your pizza pie being made fresh in front of you.",

I ordered the Porchetta with additional mushrooms  and it was delicious. The setup and order process was very easy, chipotle style ordering.   The environment is pretty chill and casual. Your usual pizza spot vibe. They even have gelato for dessert to order if u like! I can't tell you enough the dough they used is freaking amazing. That's if u like the soft crust pizza. They aren't greedy with their toppings either.   The service is pretty fast too. I would say one pizza is good for one person. It's nice to share too when your boyfriend orders a different one too! Haha definitely reasonably priced.",

But we made the right decision and were happy with our choices.  You can order one of their specialty pies or custom make your own by choosing your crust, base, and then toppings. They then assemble the pizza in front of you and fire it in the wood burning oven. We ordered the spicy meatball ($12.15): beef meatballs, ricotta, jalapenos, and calabrian chiles; and the gorgonzola salad ($8.00): buttered lettuce, candied walnuts, and dried cranberries. We love this kind of salad because of the nice balance of flavors. If you like spicy, the spicy meatball is for you. It had great combinations with calabrians forcing me to break a little sweat.  The service was very good as they run out the food to your table and they'll bring any plates or silverware that you need. They have plenty of toppings and I'll probably choose to build my pizza on the next visit.",

    "text": "Located inside SLS, 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria is putting out a legitimate Neapolitan pie. They often have a pizza of the day that's half off the regular price and promote it on their social media accounts. I noticed they were having a promotion where locals with ID got 50% off their whole bill, so hubby and I got in on that action. When I let the cashier know about the promotion and showed my ID, she accepted it with no problem and was courteous. The pizzas are baked for 60 seconds in an 800 degree oven. I did find the pizzas here comparable with those served at Settebello as far as taste, texture and overall expertise in knowing how to make a True Neapolitan pizza. If 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria had an off Strip location like Settebello, they too could have a large local following. A lot of us don't want to mess with going to the Strip, so while I loved my pizza, I can't see regularly stopping by here given the location.   Fountain Drinks ($4.00) - What a rip! I know a lot of places mark up the beverages, but come on, $4 each is totally ridiculous! 2 fountain drinks shouldn't cost as much as one pizza. Should I ever come back again I'll just stop at a corner store first and grab a fountain drink which is something hubby and I do often since we are getting the food either to-go, or we eat it in the food court of a casino, so it's not odd to see people with different beverages.   Margherita Pizza ($9.95) - Crushed tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Basil and Olive Oil. These are personal size pizzas. I really liked the flavor of the crushed tomatoes and the crust was on point being soft and chewy with the right amount of blistering around the edge of the crust. Definitely a worthy margherita.   Sausage and Peppers Pizza ($14.95) - Italian Sausage, Peppadews and caramelized onions. This one might seem pricey, but with the quality of ingredients used it's priced just right. The toppings had good flavors and all complimented each other well.    Gluten-Free Crust is available for an extra $1.50 and imported mozzarella can be substituted if your wallet feels like paying an extra $6. You can choose from the \"Chef's Favorites\" part of the menu like I did, or customize your own pizza. They also have salads, hot and cold appetizers as well beer and wine on the menu.",

You get to pick your crust, your base, your toppings and then they cook it in the wood fired oven right away. We got the thick crust with margarita base and added tri color cherry tomatoes, spinach, and  broccolini. The mozzarella is fresh and tasty. Everything about it is delicious. We also got the beet salad which had cheese to die for on it, a big huge piece of toasted fresh bread, crisp delicious yellow and red beets with wonderful balsamic dressing. They have gelato here too but I didn't get to try it. Seriously run to this restaurant. The staff is nice, the food is inexpensive and amazing, the restaurant is fun and casual with black and white paparazzi pictures on the ceiling and fun lights and decor.

I like heat but it wasn't edible. The best part of the meal was the complimentary ice water and when I walked out. This is the only venue on the property that doesn't seem to be able to get their act together. The entire team seems lost and definitely not a sign of management to be seen. A huge turn off and will most definitely be letting friends and family know about the poor service here.",

    "text": "I tried another location of this restaurant and loved it.  Unfortunately this location needs work.  I went there on a crowded weekend at about 10pm.  The environment was horrible.  There is no separation between the casino and the restaurant.  On a Saturday night there are clubbers all lined up surrounding the place making getting in or out almost impossible.  I suppose if that's your thing then go for it, but I came here to just eat.  The volume level in the entire place made it almost impossible to order or eat.  So I yelled that I wanted a Margarita base with some toppings.   I was really surprised that they charged $1.50 each for each of the six toppings we chose.   The toppings were good, but really sparse.  When you do the math, the pizza cost $7.65 plus another $9 for toppings.  Incredible.  None of this was noted on the menu wall nor was it mentioned to us.  There was no communication from the employees at all.    They need a walls.   There is no wall at all in the front.  On the side there is a low wall, but it was surrounded by dozens of people standing around talking loudly waiting to get into some club.  There is a great deal of smoke visible outside even in the dim lighting.  We also ordered a Caesar salad.  Next we paid and went to get our drinks and a table.  While we were getting drinks they were over there yelling our number over and over again.  Now I understand that due to the volume level there is a need to yell, but there was simply not enough time to sit before they were yelling for us to come get our food.  When I finally put my drink down and came back to get the pizza there was nobody there.  I was really disappointed that they did not do like their Santa Monica location and give people a number for the table and bring the food out.   Service really was horrible, too.  Nobody came to our table to ask us anything except if they could remove an empty plate.  Which was disappointing because I had issues with the food.  The salad was really plain with almost no flavor or dressing.  Just a little shredded cheese and a few croutons.  No tomatoes or anything else.  I've had better salads at fast food restaurants.   I looked around the place and there were no condiments anywhere.  No vinegar and oil.  No Parmesan cheese.  No peppers.  No salt.  No pepper. This food needed something.  Now on to the whole reason you go do a pizza restaurant.  The Pizza.  It had good crust around the edges, but it was incredibly soggy everywhere else.  Our pizza had more than the average amount of toppings.  You need to allow for this when cooking.  The toppings were almost raw and the dough did not cook.  I want to give this place one more chance.   Next time I will try it for lunch and hopefully they will improve.   I want to like this.      If I had to sum this place up in two words they would be Loud and Soggy.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this conveniently located pizzeria inside SLS Las Vegas Hotel. Let's just start by saying, I'm from Chicago, so I'm not easily impressed when it comes to other pizzerias when I'm away from home...but I digress. I ran into four women, varies ages, but strolling together through the casino, carrying individual pizza boxes from 800. I stopped one of the ladies to ask her about the pizza and she went into a hallelujah chorus about it...and the other three joined the choir. I didn't know them, but based on their enthusiasm alone, I decided to give it a try. The ordering process was easy enough. There are pre-selected topping choices, or you can create you own. You start with the crust, select a sauce, proteins and topping/fixings. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza. They restaurant has a wood-fired brick oven, so the waiting time was less than 10 mins tops. When I got to my room, my mouth was watering with anticipation, so I opened the box and dove right in. I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this was the most tasteless, seasonless pizza I had ever eaten. Although my pie contained fresh mozzarella, it wasn't melted uniformly. The sausage was ok, but did not adhere to the cheese, so most of the meat just rolled right off. The crust...and this is how I judge all pizzas..was disappointing.  Although it wasn't thin to my personal liking, it was thin enough, but soggy, perhaps due to the thin sauce. This experience really disappointed me, not only because I was really hungry, but I felt this property should be able to offer award-winning Neapolitan-style pizza.  It hurts me to say, I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Time for my review of this place as I feel it deserves my review since becoming a regular here. My first time here I was hungry for just a slice or two of pizza and ordered the margarita pizza thinking the menu price was per slice. To much of my pleasant surprise it was for a whole individual personal pie!! I love how you get to choose a great array of top ingredients such as truffles. I'm a huge fan of truffles. Whenever I come here (average 3 times a week now) I always order the pizza with truffle oil truffle salt and truffle cheese. The aroma from the oil when added to the food just brings out the flavors. One choice i always get is their truffle cheese bread. A huge portion big enough to satisfy a foodie like me who loves leaving a restaurant full and happy. The staff here from the pizza makers to cashiers and managers have all been very friendly and accommodating especially once they've gotten to know me and see me come by many times. Plus one of the girl pizza makers is hot and cute . It was also very nice of Kenny (I believe he was a manager) to have bought me a pistachio gelato, thanks Kenny. This place is so good I encouraged all my local and visiting friends to come try out their food and the response from them were all positive all of them said they enjoyed it so much they came back for another 2 or more times. One friend of mine who I kept insisting they try their food kept hesitating so I bought her several pizzas and a truffle cheese bread for her and she is now a regular like me. That's how much I believe in their menu items that I was more than happy and willing to just pay for it all. Now on a separate note I was there last night and tried the side of meatballs with my main order and was a bit disappointed in that selection. Felt that it was not worth the $7 for a few tiny bites but no worries I just won't order it again the pros of their food makes me still come here regularly. To all the staff here reading this thank you for everything and keep up the great work. I want to see you guys stick around for years and years. And to the cute woman pizza maker ...... \"Hey there ..... \"",

It's cafeteria style, with seat yourself benches and outdoor dining. If you want a restaurant intimate experience this is not the place. It's not crazy overpriced either. You get a good sized fresh specialty pizza for the same price as a local pizza place back home. The only drawback is waiting in line. It's usually very busy and lined up out the door.",

I would eat here anytime it is 50% off but otherwise I wouldn't make this my first choice for pizza. I ordered the white pizza and added nothing else but the spicy salami. My boyfriend ordered a margarita and added shredded provolone and pepperoni. I liked his pizza better than mine, mine could have been good if there was more cheese so at least for next time I know.   The flavor of the pizzas were ok but just as everyone else said---these were the flimsiest pizzas ever, very soggy and greasy in the middle. The crust was fine.   I like the concept and I will return but only on Sunday for the locals promotion.",

The Gogo dancers were jamming and you can see everyone going in and out of the Sayers club. As I'm typing this, some group just let out the loudest longest cheer at a game table. Gotta love Vegas and the crazy variety you get in food, people, and entertainment!  Definitely worth a stop I and if you are in the mood for something sweet, try the pistachio gelato. Awesomeness!",

Ordered totofu, lots of white cheese, with oily garlic, an assortment of mushrooms, and arugula. Beautiful, But didn't tastes delicious. Was super fresh and oven baked. Beautiful ambiance, like soda pop fountain!! The cashier said he'd bring it out to us, but the other guy just yelled out our number!!! He must have been too busy!! They even have fresh gelato!!

It was 25 minutes before the pizza even made it into the oven and it was only one person ahead of me. The make line was mortifying. The register staff just as bad.  The pizza was burnt on the bottom and soggy in the middle. Someone (a great employee) saw me turning the pizza over and taking a picture so they made another one - unfortunately it was almost the same... undercooked on top overcooked on bottom... soggy in the middle with cheese turning into rubbery clumps as the pizza got past room temperature heading to cold.   With all of these amazing ingredients at your fingertips and a wonderful Neapolitan concept... how could you go wrong?  The oven may need some temperature calibration?  How could they get this amazing pizza concept so wrong?  Yes, but yet they do!  Fascinating.",

Their pizzas are perfectly crafted Naples style creations and their specialty pizzas were ALL fantastic to the last bite! They also serve wonderful salads and side dishes that are equally delicious.

The crust was edible and delicious, and this place has potential to be the new custom built, considering it's closing, but ALL of the cheese fell off, and the crust under the cheese seemed half cooked. It was very greasy and soggy other than the crust :(",

It's a Neapolitan pizza and people assume it's like blaze or pieology, it's not. The dough is really thin and the workers let you know you shouldn't add more than 3 toppings or put extra sauce because it will get very soggy. They do have a crispy crust if you wanted to pile high on your toppings which cost $1.50 each. Anyway, I love the white pizza! It doesn't have the red sauce so it's really not soggy. If I get the margherita pizza, I ask for very light sauce. The toppings here are great, the spicy salami is the best. They have a pizza called the angry bee and it has the spicy salami, chills, and honey! It's the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. I like the Neapolitan crust. It's nice and chewy and has great flavor. The crispy crust is ok if you like the cracker like crust.",

After standing in line for 15 minutes watching a completely incompetent cashier try to apply a coupon to the group in front of me, I simply had to give up. Never was I looked at, spoken to, or even acknowledged by the cashier. I'm sure the food would've been great but it had already been out of the oven for a good 8 to 10 minutes by the time I decided to walk off because of their incompetence.

    "text": "Another place to get pizza. 800 Degrees is located in the Sahara. It's in the northeast corner of the casino. Dining area is kind of small. Most customers seem to take it with them.   Getting here is a bit of a hassle. If you aren't staying here you have to walk a ways to get to it. This is located in the casino area along the wall. It's way back from where you enter through the front. The set up is much like all those rapid fire pizza places. It has a menu at the front. You go through the line and tell the person what toppings you want. After they finish topping it they put it in the oven. This only takes a few minutes and it's ready. Overall the pizza tastes good. Prices are higher than normal but it's a specialty pizza in a casino so it's expected to cost more than Pizza Hut or similar shit. A typical pizza is about $15 for a personal size, and thankfully it's pretty big. They charge for each topping unless it's one of the preselected styles.   If you're tired of boring pizza come here. It's good for the price. They make it super fast so there's almost no wait.",

You can build your own pizza with fresh ingredients (which can get expensive) or choose one of their pizzas that has preselected ingredients.   I chose to build my own which ended up being around $20 total. I'd say that was a bit expensive. I did however enjoy the pizza and it was a pretty decent size. I was able to finish the whole thing alone so if you have a big appetite like me and you decide take a friend, you might want to consider ordering your own pizzas lol.",

($17) Thin crust & she made it right in front of me. Tons of toppings & ingredients to choose from. I literally walked a few feet to pay ($18) & for a cup of ice water for here. Grabbed napkins n a straw, hen the girl gave me a sample of their strawberry cheesecake gelato (so good!) sat down  & they called my order #! Wow so fast-hence the name of the restaurant \"800 Degrees\" it takes less then 5 minutes for a personalized pizza! It was hot fresh & delish. My new go to for fast pizza-closest thing since NY Style thin crust pizza I've had since I've lived on the west coast in 3 years! I'll be back & def spread the word. Great concept & excellent  service & execution.",

You'll still drop $15 on a pizza, but that doesn't really bother me. It likely shouldn't bother you considering how much you drop at a casino table.   Cooked nicely, and it served my needs. I can't comment on the non-GF, but this was definitely on the up side of GF crusts. No line mid-day Sunday which made me happy.",

My husband and I got two different halves - spinach, kalmata olives, roasted tomatoes, & artichokes on my half. No artichokes but bacon instead on his. Yum!

    "text": "Found ourselves in the SLS again and wanted to try something new. We missed the Ku Noodle special by 10 minutes so we decided to just grab a pie at 800 Degrees.  Prices are fair, considering location ($8.95-$9.95) for your pie, with each additional topping running extra($1.00-$1.50).   We each grabbed a Neapolitan pizza with one additional topping each. I opted for the chicken, while my friend chose the Italian sausage. The service was adequate, but certainly nothing special. I encountered 3 employees here and did not see a single smile.   Going through the line was fairly quick, but the cashier was a bit slow. I guess they serve alcoholic beverages as well, but we just chose to grab a couple of fountain drinks. When we got our pies we were handed a receipt that indicated $24 in charges. I can live with that, I'm thinking. At the register, I added 2, 20 ounce sodas. The new total was $33! Holy crap! $4.50 for a fucking soda?!? Seriously, I get that I am in a casino on the strip. I get it. But almost $5 for a 20 ounce soda is excessive even for that!  The pies were actually good. The chicken on my pie was tasty and I really enjoyed it. My friend was equally satisfied with his meal.  If i didn't get gouged on the sodas, this would have been a 4 star review. But, in all honesty, I am one and done with this place. I like to enjoy a soda with my pizza and that price is a straight up joke.  Not only that, a big pet peeve of mine is when I tip and receive no acknowledgement. Even after getting violated on the sodas, I still left a few bucks for the employees(after all, they don't set the prices, right?). No \"thanks\", no anything. I don't expect you to kiss my butt, but sheesh...say something. I work for tips and every time someone leaves me something I always make it a point to say \"thank you, I appreciate that\". I guess they must be rolling in it over there.  Anyways, I was less than impressed and won't be back. Too bad, the pies were actually good for the price, but all that other mess assures I won't be back.  2 stars.",

Seem like the pizza should have been cooking a little longer since the cheese was not completely melted and the meat pizza had so much oil.

The ingredients are higher quality than a blaze - I chose the margarita base and added pepperoni.  They also have a Blanca base mad a pesto base.   If you prefer, there is a selection of preset pies and also salads.  The one thing to keep in mind, it gets expensive fast.  Each topping is an extra charge, which is different than blaze and some toppings (buffalo mozzarella) are even more!    This isn't a 5 star joint because of the cost and also the location and very limited hours.   Service was OK, but they seem incredibly understaffed and a bit slow.",

We had the quattro formagio on thin crust, and it was one of the best 4 cheese pizzas i've eaten.  Sauce was good, cheese was great quality.  Only quibble is about that crust - i like my cracker thin and crispy!  Service was reasonably quick and polite, maybe a bit better than we experienced other places in a tourist oriented town.  One pizza fed 2 of us quite satisfactorily.",

The crust is divine and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Try the Margherita with yummy basil.   Oh, and unlike the $70 pizza rumored to be sold at Rock in Rio USA, this place right across the street is around $10 - $15, depending on your toppings. WELL WORTH THE SHORT WALK!

Her pizza was topped with a normal amount of toppings as it moved down the line with her server. Mine was topped with less than half the amount of topping by my server, right behind the other pizza. I finally said, hey, let's put a little product on the bread as I pointed to the nice looking pizza sitting right beside mine. The server looked confused and the server that was properly preparing the other pizza backed up and added the correct amount of toppings to mine. These little personal pizzas aren't cheap. Mine was 12 bucks and the proper amount of toppings is still skimpy. And the dude pouring my beer was pathetic. I was going to mention the 1/3 glass of head, but he'd already tried a half dozen times and I was hungry. I'm not cheap, I just don't like working harder at preparing my food than my server does.",

It really did only a few minutes to cook.  The pizza crust was crispy and a little soggy in the middle which is ok since Napolitano pizza is not that bready.  The overall toppings blended well. Definitely a winner. ..  :p",

I think \"mmm Las Vegas what should I eat?\" Once I got there I decided why eat something like seafood in the middle of the desert when I live in the most amazing State and area there is for seafood. So the hunt was on for something tasty and inexpensive. I like the concept of this restaurant. It's almost cafeteria like or Panda Express'ish. It turned out to be a little expensive for my taste as it was a dollar fifty for a small handful of a topping & I'm talking mushroom & onion a dollar fifty each. The salad that I chose is a chopped salad with chunks of meat: salami, pepperoni, ham & such, along with a little cheese & chopped peppercinis and a really good oregano vinaigrette. All in all it was a nice meal the total came to $29 and that included a small pizza the one chopped salad which was enough for two people & 1 soda that cost $4.00! As they left the place I thought; I could open one of these in Ventura County after I retire.  I originally did my check-in at the wrong location. This review is for the one I actually went to. I'm sure they're all very similar anyway!",

We couldn't finish a whole pizza so we decided to order the truffle cheese bread and the antipasto plate. They were huge for the price. i really enjoyed the cheeses and meats on the antipasto although it was kind of weird that the cheese was shredded.  The truffle bread was amazing and super cheesy.  I've heard some of the pizzas were really amazing so next time I would like to try one. I wish they could make smaller pizzas though because I'm not really a pizza person to begin with.

It's different, and people love it.    I did just get a basic pizza to try it out. It was a little more expensive than you would want it to be. You are paying for the quality tho because the dough is quite fresh, sauce good, and cheese good. I was most impressed by the crust actually, which is actually something that I am super picky about as someone who prefers thick crust pizza.   It's exciting to see the 800 degrees brand expand from SoCal to multiple locations on the strip now. If you're in the SLS I promise it's a great option for a quick and easy eat!  My major problem is that I did have an 800 gift card, which the business could not process and therefore I had to pay with the little bit of gambling cash I had left. Really hope they fix their gift card system!",

    "text": "We were at SLS one night and decided instead of going to the Cafe to try something different. This was the first time we have ever heard of or tried this pizza place out. It is amazing! We loved it! When you walk in most the time there is a line but it goes pretty fast! You tell the guy what kind of dough you want and then the toppings.... move a long the way and once you have ordered everything they will charge you, almost by the time your done paying the pizza is almost done! I am serious we no sooner paid and got our drink went to find a table they were calling our number! The flavors depend on what you want to put on the pizza. I did the fresh Mozzarella and fresh mushrooms and I think he had Fresh Mozzerella, pineapple and jalapenos on his. They were both very flavorful and cooked just right, I know he keeps asking when we will go there again cause he is craving their pizza. I have to say I am not big on pizza and this one was VERY good. I mean it really was so fresh tasting. I would say we will for sure go back! No doubt!!  And there is plenty of pizza I usually bring home 2 pieces he eats all of his,, Nice size you order one per person unless you order other stuff you can share.  If your at SLS make this one of your stops! You will really enjoy it too! Plus everything was nice and clean!",

    "text": "800 Degrees is a popular pizza shop along the Vegas strip just outside the Monte Carlo hotel.  I recommend arriving off peak hours (so it's not that busy).  I ordered the Margarita pizza with pepperoni, and sausages.  The pizza was picked up at the pick up window smelling delicious. (The food was delicious as well)  We didn't have a bad experience. Our friends complained that their salads lacked dressing.  If you sit outside you'll enjoy two different genres of music of neighboring bars.",

A 20 oz drink is $4.50 which is ridiculous but hey, it's Vegas. The service was also subpar. The girls working didn't smile at us at all while they were making our order, and seemed more focused on getting us out of there so that they could go back to gossiping with eachother.  All in all, it was okay, but I won't be returning. I could've spent that $25 somewhere else and gotten twice the amount of food.",

I've been seeking out Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) for a while and found Settebello to be more on par with what real Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be.  Sorry, 800.  We were hoping to have a VPN place closer to the Strip, but maybe not this time.  Overall, it lacks what should be a better drink selection with the pizza and the quality of the cheese should not make the pie \"soupy\".  You can taste the difference in the ingredients and this can't be VPN.  In any case, the staff gets points, but the quality of the product doesn't.",

You can chose from many fresh premium ingredients that are lined up so you can see them behind the counter. And then...the magic happens. The pizza cooks to perfection in 60 seconds in their 800 degree oven, hence the name ;-) Bonus points for them being open late night too. Located right outside the new megaclub 'LIFE'",

Thing is - I think that quality suffers due to the extreme volume that these guys go through.  The assembly-line \"choose your ingredients\" was nice, but the finished pizza really should be left in the heavily-touted 800-degree wood-fired oven for a few minutes longer.  A droopy pizza just looks sad, and really took away from the experience.  On the other hand, the burrata and beets balsamic salad is a far fresher and better choice.  Expect this place to get packed, and enjoy it for the people-watching opportunity as well.  Just be sure to ask for your pie to be well-done.",

When I bit into the pizza all I tasted was olive oil and no seasoning.   This pizza has the potential to be really good but the person making it needs to know the ratio of ingredients that work in order to give the pizza flavor and make the crust hold up better.",

At the register, you order your drinks and wait for your order to be fired. They call your number when the pizza is ready.   They have water cups, small plates, utensils, napkins and small boxes for leftovers on a side counter where you help yourself.  This is the type of pizza that doesn't hold up well so be aware and eat it at the restaurant and do not get it to go.  The hubs wanted to create his own pizza and I warned him not to go overboard with ingredients. Like 2 toppings is probably the maximum you want to get. He insisted on the marinara (all sauce with garlic and oregano) with ricotta, sausage and mushroom. As the pizza maker loaded the pizza with 2 large scoops of sauce, this was a disaster in the making. The pizza was horribly soggy in the middle while the garlic was not evenly distributed in the pizza so you ended up with mouthful of garlic. The sausage and mushrooms were bland too. Textural violation number 1 of the night.  Okay, shame on us for making a bad pizza.   But for the Tartufo, I expected them to make a quality product as it is their specialty pie. Again, terribly soggy pizza, greasy as hell from the excess amount of olive oil - literally dripping down my hand as I am trying to eat it. There are too much toppings for such a thin crust and it totally does not hold up. Ugh! Textural violation number 2 of the night. Flavorwise, this one was okay but nothing special. The truffle was a bit understated while eating the pizza.  There are 2 problems because the pizzas were fired correctly (anymore, the crust would be burnt). Either the crust is the issue or it is too much toppings. My vote goes to the amount of toppings because the edge of the crust was fine.  The Caesar was horrible. Probably the worst Caesar I've had in a long time. There was a very weird fruity aroma that permeated throughout the salad. I think maybe it is the type of cheese they used. Or maybe some other elements from another salad got mixed in. Whatever it was, it was very off putting. I didn't taste any garlic or anchovies in the dressing at all. The red leaf lettuce they threw in became limp quickly from the acidity of the dressing and having too much dressing. Textural violation number 3 -it's a hat trick!  End of the story, I am glad we got to try it as a half priced local deal. Full price I would have been mad. Skip this joint. You can get better quality pizza and salad elsewhere for a better value.

    "text": "The employees at 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria in Vegas were quite friendly. I forgot to pick up my greens salad because I was preoccupied with my pizza. An employee chased me down the casino to give it to me. There was something comforting coming to a pizzeria that I am familiar with in the LA vicinity.  The concept is simple. It is a thin pizza served with any type of topping you desire. They have several different types of pizzas to choose from if you are indecisive, but I prefer to choose my own base and toppings such as spinach, mushrooms, peppadews, etc. It is a great place to visit at least once if you are staying at the SLS. Honestly, if I really tried, I could have eaten the whole entire pizza, but half of my pizza was plenty to tame my hunger. I'd recommend the burrata dishes. It is so delicious! Stay away from the greens salad as I was overwhelmed by the lemon dressing.",

Like the broccoli  and artichoke. But the Verde is my absolute favorite. Pesto, Fontina cheese, 2x bacon add sausage on crispy crust. Never woulda thought a green base pizza would be so good! The crispy crust has tiny holes so don't get too much pesto or underneath'll be a little too wet. Enjoy!",

I wasn't terribly excited at first because I eat at 800 Degrees frequently in LA, but one day I was hungry and impatient.  Their food always delivers.  Pizza is thin crust, light, and makes you less guilty for eating carbs. Toppings are a plenty - I always like the broccoli, garlic, white pizza. The truffle cheese bread is a little too thick and bready and much for me - but the flavor is spot on.  The service was outstanding - the guys working there were incredibly friendly.  Pizzas are ready in 90 seconds.",

    "text": "One of the best pizzas you will ever try! Everytime i decide to bring someone here that is visiting from out of town, i like to describe it as the Subway of pizzas. Meaning when you get there you choose whether you want their original crust or the thin crust, i would go with original crust because the thin crust is almost as thin as a tortilla. Then you can tell them if u want one of their specialty pizzas on the menu, or you can start with the base of a Margherita, which includes sauce, mozzarella, olive oil and basil, and then you can add any other toppings you want, and just like subway, they are laid out so you can see them. And it's a lot of topping choices.   The best part of all, they serve beer! and gelato! But the pizza really is amazing, i would reccomend sharing one pizza between two. It hits the spot but doesn't leave u too full. But if you are a really hungry man, then maybe you should get your own.",

We tried the Pizza Bianca and topped it up with ricotta to try to reproduce the white pie at Secret Pizza. The pizza was garlicky and the crust was quite good, but the ricotta tasted more like mascarpone (on the sweet side), so it wasn't close to the heavenly ricotta bites from Secret Pizza. But it's quite decent and worth trying out and trying other combinations and toppings.  The pizza cooks super fast at 800 degrees, you can count 20 secs and it'll be ready.",

Normally I'm not an \"eat the crust\" kind of guy, but with good pizza, I'll do it.   800 degrees delivered for me!   I like the fact that you can add on different toppings to their selections, and you can see it being made right before you.   My wife started with the white pizza and added caramelized onions, bacon, and roasted garlic.   I had the Napoletana and added fresh Mozz to mine.   The service (the folks making the pizza) was a little slow, but the joint had only been open for 2 weeks prior.   However they should've brought out more staff to help accommodate the quickly growing line.   In any case, in went our pizzas and out in less than 2 minutes.  Super quick, super fresh, and super good!   The ingredients were good, although like most Neapolitan Pizzas, the ingredients are scarce.   I loved the crust though, just wished there was more cheese and capers.   Nonetheless, we had a great pizza and a great experience.",
