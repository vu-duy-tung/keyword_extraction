    "text": "Best new restaurant opening in the last year in Sin City.    Service is stellar.  We felt listened to and taken care of.  Got relocated to the seating we wanted and didn't get a sour face when we didn't dig the champagne.    Bathrooms are WAY in the back, but HOORAY for bathrooms IN the establishment. Some patrons were walking out to the casino to the loo, don't make that mistake.  The GREATS: *Lucia's Caesar, such a whimsical spin on an old classic, flavor, texture, all there *caviar, loved the presentation, creme fraiche from a tube of toothpaste, trout roe and osetra, need the traditional blinis, the fried pillowy puffs were overpowering *Bluefin tuna sashimi, generous offering, just melted, don't dip in sauce, plenty of flavor *Uni on blood sausage, SO good.  Every restaurant should serve this.  Surf and turf. *Bison carpaccio, celery packed a whallop *Desserts are small and not overly sweet, do the strawberry bacon and the cassis and rose meringue  OKAY: *salmon tartare, WAY too much and avocado layer was overkill on the fat/cream, however the nori dusted shrimp chips that accompanied, were gobbled up *Asian tacos, it was salt on salt on salt.  Nori does not go with jamon iberico  MINUS 1* for the terrible Kobe, $30/oz for 4oz cannot be ANY less than spectacular.  It tasted like how raw ground beef smells.  CHEAP ground beef.  Smearing wasabi saved it.    It was nice we were surprised with an interlude: an adult sorbet, tableside.  Lots of choices on the menu, not a noodle, rice or doughy item on the menu.  If you want something starchy, potatoes people.    I was squealing most of the meal.  In delight.  So much better than the original in the 90048.  Perfectly executed, conceptual food, but still TASTES good.",

    "text": "We found it hard to believe we could not order a nice one pound Ribeye, customers may NOT order a higher price per pound cut of meat unless they order 2lb cuts at the $98 a lb ... So that being said...it would have been better had we known the owner set menu is designed to be shared in the group. No deviation. It's fine but the two pounders for 198$ is more than enough for four people, but we had no other couple in our party to share with. The sides. The sides are priced rediculously high it is like a dab for 35$ bam...there's one side. How about ten leaves of romaine standing up in a serving dishes on ice with  a radish sprout in the center, with ranch $15. The salmon sashimi was seven piece at $24 + best amount of food for price. Ok, the ambiance is what you pay for and we get that. The service was the TOP but they could see we were perplexed and wanted one pound of ribeye at $98. I have to give you 5 stars for the chefs, but 5-4 =1 total star. If we had not been in for the special occasion my husband and I would have walked out before dining here. Sad face.",

Me and my girl and one of my friend share the black angus ribeyes which was about 3lbs ($225) and my other buddy had the vaca vieja ($160+). His steak has more flavor but the black angus was much more tender (I prefer the black angus). It took a bit for the steak to come out but we didn't mind since we sat and drink and talk. I also order raw clams (amazing, better than raw oyster and I love raw oysters). The mushrooms was amazing. The potatoes was good (to me) and the Brussel sprouts was decent. My other buddy also order 3oz of a5 wagyu which he love (I had ate wagyu before so I know). Ok for the black angus. It was cool perfectly to me. Medium rare. Could of use a bit more seasoning but I didn't mind. Make sure you share because they sell by the chop size and not by the exact amount u want. I definite will go back to this place when I'm in Vegas again. Also the dessert with the bacon in it is freaking awesome.",

    "text": "I've been to a couple of Jose Andres restaurants now - Bazaar in the SLS Beverly Hills and at e inside of the Jaleo in The Cosmopolitan.  So Andres' \"tricks\" have gotten a tad old.  The fois gras cotton candy and salt air margarita are fun to try for the first time, but then the thrill factor fades fast.   The concept here is modern steakhouse - all dark woods and bullheads in masks.  I love all of the open kitchens, but with Bazaar Meat, it feels as if Andres just kinda phoned it in.  On one side of the over-sized menu that feels like it weights a ton is the fun molecular gastronomy little bites and on the other, the meat and potatoes.    From the molecular side we tried:  fois gras cotton candy   super-sized pork skin Chicharron with greek yogurt - They're not kidding when they say it's \"super-sized.\"  It's huge, and the fun part was when the server brought out a silver mallet to break it into pieces.    Bagels and lox cone - a classic   \"Foieffle\" - a new item I haven't seen before, which was a little bite-sized waffle filled with liver pate, peanut butter and honey.  It was a little gooey and messy to eat.    Sloppy Joe - was just ok, just like the name says - a mini little sloppy joe  For entree, we split the Wagyu Beef Cheeks entree with Robuchon potatoes and brussels sprouts petals. The potatoes were so buttery and the Brussels sprouts had a nice citrus-y vinaigrette that counterbalanced all of the richness of the potatoes.  I enjoyed the beef cheeks, but it was a little too weird for the beau.  I should have forewarned him by saying this was what headcheese is made from.  Overall, a great Vegas dining experience where style trumps substance.",

I do like other Bazaar locations menus better, but many that is because I am not the biggest fan of meat (I'm not a vegetarian, it's just not my favorite food). But there is always plenty of options for me to try and I never leave hungry or feeling like I didn't have options. Desserts are yummy. Drinks are good.

    "text": "This one's a take off from the dotted line, 360 two handed jam, bring the rim down, shatter the backboard slam dunk. We had quite a memorable experience enjoying some of the world's great delicacies at Bazaar Meats. There's just too much to recognize to be concise with this review, but if you are only reading the first paragraph of reviews, love meat, and on the fence about coming here, then I'll list three items that might draw you in: Kobe beef, Jamon Iberico de Bellota, and suckling pig.  These were three meats that were the highlights of the $275 tasting menu. Not saying the other 12 plates were chopped liver, these three were on another level. They're served they way I like because they don't need sauces and they don't need extravagant presentations. The flavors are unique, rich, and decadent and are to be savored in the the least complicated form.  Your carnivorous experience starts even before you enter the restaurant as you take in the aroma of smoke and cooking meat when you approach the entrance. Visually, if you are not in the mood, the decor in this sleek dining area will get you there in the first few steps upon entering. From the blood drop lighting in the bar, the displays of hanging pork, to a large reptilian type head with razor sharp teeth, whatever meat eating primal instincts you have will be brought to the forefront.  After a Jameson neat to warm up the engine, our group of four was sat at the end of one of the long communal tables directly in front of the open kitchens. Chris warmly greeted us with smiles to begin our journey. We could not have been more pleased with Chris as he was our tour guide directing us each step of the way, explaining the small plate/sharing concept with food coming from six different open kitchens (fire pit, hot plates, meat bar, seafood, salads, and dessert) which he forewarned us that this can present difficulty in the timing of delivery. Chris also did an excellent job at finding us two bottles of Spanish wine to pair with our food which helped put the meal over the top.  As for the meats:   A5 KOBE TENDERLOIN, HYOGO PREFECTURE, JAPAN: The word Kobe gets thrown around way too much when describing Japanese wagyu. If someone tells you that they are serving you Kobe in Vegas and you are not at Bazaar, Prime, or SW, then look up your butt, because someone blew some smoke up it. Kobe has the strictest standards of quality and marbling. The Tajima cows (which are a strain of the Japanese Black Wagyu) must be born and raised in the Hyogo Prefecture and must adhere to a weight standard before slaughtered. A restaurant (as of our visit, only three in Vegas) must be certified to buy and sell the beef by displaying a bronze statuette. The tenderloin we sampled was the fattiest piece of tenderloin I've had. Don't attempt to order this beef more than medium rare as the fat has a low melting point and higher temperatures will just render the tasty fat out. As for the flavor, juicy and rich, with the fat melting in your mouth as you eat it. The texture is very soft as you won't have to bite through tough musculature because these cows have been fattened through traditional feeding techniques since birth.  JAMON IBERICO DE BELLOTA: This is the upper echelon of Iberian ham and of cured meat period. This meat comes from the black footed pig that is free ranging in Spain and only fed acorns. The meat is cured for two years before it reaches the restaurant. Sliced paper thin, the salted meat has a sweetness with a nutty, earthy flavor that the acorns impart. The flavor of the ham is savory on its own with no accoutrements needed.  SUCKLING PIG: The 'heart and soul' of Bazaar Meat. The pig is cooked in the wood burning grill. Being Filipino, I'm very famaliar with lechon. This lechon is on another level with the contrast of super crispy skin and rich, tender pork. This meat is so rich, that mixta salad is the perfect accompaniment to cut through this richness. We had majority agreement that this was the most flavorful meat of the night.  Take a look at the photo of the menu and of the other photos if you want to see the other great plates we sampled. The bison carpaccio and the beef tartare deserve honorable mention of the rest of the menu. Also worth mentioning is that if the dessert factor is high when you assess a meal, then you might be disappointed. All desserts were minute samples and difficult to share among four people leaving you with pretty much a tip of the spoon portion. The desserts had no effect on my rating and I would have been just as happy and satisfied without them. I'll take a snifter Remy Martin VSOP for my finale.  To call Bazaar Meats a steakhouse is not accurate, Chef Andres would prefer it be a called a meathouse. I would come here with an open mind to try some of the different meats that are all served in uncomplicated presentations. There's also no doubt that you should expect to pay top dollar for your experience, but worth every cent in my book.",

Came here for a Valentine's dinner date with my boyfriend. From a couple suggestions from coworkers, I reserved prior a few day before and was the only restaurant still open for reservations and I believe it was fate! Atmosphere wise: amazing! Although it was dark which makes you just focus on the food tasting experience.  We got the Cotton candy foie gras, Vittore 1950 Carpaccio, Wagyu beef cheeks, half dozen oysters on the half shell, a huge piece of steak but honestly forgot the name, their famous mashed potatoes, asparagus and a few cocktails (mostly are not pictured) and bill came out around $460 plus tip! Thought that the experience was worth it for the price! Everyone was professional and friendly. Our server's name was Mark, who thoroughly explained the menu and was attentive to our needs. So this is for you, Mark, keep doing your thing. Would definitely come back again. Thank you Bazaar",

    "text": "This was my second time here and I would definitely come back again. The food, ambiance and service is all excellent. The first time I came here, we had a custom tasting menu so we were able to a variety of things. The second time around, I ordered some favorites from the first time and tried some new things. I know they are known for their meats but I haven't been impressed particularly with the steak or suckling pig but all of the shared plates are really great!  Chicharron, Giant Pork Skin - one of my favorites. Fried pork skin with heavy spices (pepper, salt, cumin) and a yogurt dip.  The Classic Beef Tartar - very tasty, another favorite. One of the best tartars I've had.  Robuchon Potatoes - very rich and extremely buttery. I enjoyed it but couldn't eat too much of it. Gave me instant food coma.  Oxtail Buns - fried oxtail bun with quail egg and caviar on top. It was recommended by the waiter. Very flavorful.   Mushroom Side - small portobello mushrooms topped with olive oil, garlic and parsley. Simple but went well with our meal.   Suckling Pig 1/8 - also came with a salad. I pre-ordered this. Normally they do not to 1/8 but they ran out of 1/4 that evening. Glad it was only 1/8 because there were only two of us and we ordered a lot of food. This dish is their signature dish but my least favorite. Overall, it was ok, it was tender but agree with the other yelpers that mentioned that the Chinese roasted pig is better.",

I can go on and on with each of the plates but I would simply urge you to just go and try it. Probably also the most expensive meal I've ever had also but I'm still glad i tried this place. My favorite was the foie gras cotton candy, steak tartare, beefsteak tartare, bison carpaccio, and of course the steak at the end. There are these potato puffs which taste like hashbrown chips. If you want to eat the most elegant food and have the money, highly recommend waking up your tasting pallete here",

I have been blessed to dine at all the best restaurants in the city--Le Cirque, Le Monde de Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Twist, Guy Savoy to name but a few.  And while they have all been 5 star experiences... and some have even brought tears to my eyes... none come come close to my time at Bazaar Meat.    Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian.  My dining companion was not.   Now, secretly, I love to go to steak house becaue they tend to have the best vegetabes.... but I always feel badly because I know that I will not be spending like the steak eaters.  The staff were not only accommodating, but almost excited to show me how well they could do for me.  Firstly, the hostess was lovely. We started at the bar.  The bartenders were kind, not over bearing, super polite to allow me time to decide from their cocktail selection and even asked my friend if he would like to wait for me (he did, and he was happy that he was asked), and made an exquisite NY Sour. Then we made it to our table.  Essentially, we gave the manager and servers our dietary preferences and trusted them to make our night.  OMG DO THIS.  We selected the Silver Oak Cabernet, and the sommelier was prompt and... well.... just seemed to have a wonderful soul.  Not pretentious.  Just happiness exuding.    The gazpacho shots were perfection. The best gazpacho I may have ever had. The amuse bouche was gorgeous, artful, and wonderfully kind to have one for my vegetarian self as well.   I had the tomato tar tar, which was just gorgeous.  My friend had a beef tar  tar which was prepared table side and really made the moment feel special.  The tomato salad was perfect in its simplicity. And then all the vegetables!  Oh my word.  The roasted cauliflower.  YES! The potato puree.  YES! grilled baby corn?  YES.  ASPARAGUS.  THE BEST I HAVE HAD EVER.  Roasted Carrots over a yogurt sauce.  The night's star for me.  And the roasted peppers in a cast iron dish.  So sweet.  so perfect..  YES YES YES .  my meat-loving friend who rarely recognizes that vegetable exist said that the peppers even beat his steak.  AND HE LOVED THE STEAK.  AND THEN THERE WAS THE DESSERT CART. HOLY COW.  The man who rolled this wonder towards us asked what we would like, but it was just too overwhelming to choose so we asked him to choose for us.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. I do not remember the exact names of the bite sized moments of wonder, but some standouts were a dark chocolate ganache covered mousse half-sphere with actual gold flecks atop and a little pink cake with perfect layers of fruit and vanilla cake--which sounds dull but was anything but.  I was so full, I forgot to ask for port.  To the servers, to the bussing staff, to the managers, to the hostess and bartenders, to the runner who explained everything perfectly,  Thank you.  I have not been able to stop talking about this experience.  I will be back many times over.  It wasn't just delicious; it was down right fun.",

    "text": "Easily one of the best meals we've had. I noted my husband's shellfish allergy in our reservation,  and they had a shellfish-free menu waiting upon check-in. Our server was fantastic and made sure we ordered enough food without going overboard--especially since my husband would not be sharing any of my seafood and most food is meant to be shared.  I started with the Liquid Nitrogen cocktail,  Don't be a Lemon. It was prepared tableside and was a great way to set the mood--elegant, but fun. My yellow fin carpaccio arrived next, with chopsticks. Light and melt-in-your-mouth, with just enough acid to balance.   My husband's classic beef tartare, sans anchovies, was the next to arrive. Great chat with the prep-guy about the values of tartare and the sourcing of the sirloin (California collective, retired dairy cows--this felt like Portlandia for a minute). My husband loved this dish. I'm honestly a bit afraid I'll discover he's sneaking off just to get this.  For entrees, we got the New Zealand rack of lamb and the grilled pulpo, with the roasted leeks as a side and the Aladdin Manhattan to drink, which was lovely and smoky. The fresh mint on the lamb was brilliant. The leeks were excellent. The grilled octopus was the only even mildly disappointing dish and that was only because Old School Pizzeria makes equally good octopus, not because Bazaar Meats was in any way bad. Gio just makes exceptional octopus. The price points were also similar, so this really isn't a complaint.   My husband ate all of his tartare and 60% of the lamb, so he had no room for dessert. I got the the Tahitian vanilla and raspberry cream puff, the cassis meringue, and the strawberries, cream and bacon tart (which I split with him). I love that the desserts were small enough to experiment with. All of them were good, the cassis especially so. I would order a box of those.  Go hungry. It's worth it.",

    "text": "This place is a Mecca for meat lovers.  Most steakhouses have a ribeye and a strip and so on, here they have a selection of ribeyes, no not just bone in or not but different breeds, different farmers, different aging techniques.  They have a 2 side by side grillworks inferno Argentinian style wood fires grills. Then in front of the grills is a display case showing their featured meats that have just incredible marbling, range of color depth depending on how long they aged and the breed.  They even have meat that comes from older animals for those interested.  Being a real meat enthusiast, I prefer to pick the exact steaks I wanted for our group and they happily accommodate.  So they get the meat going asap because they are thick and take a while to cook.  Being a real pro, I pre ordered a quarter suckling pig Which is the best I've ever had 2 times now. Suckling pig is one of my favorite things, so it's a good compliment.  Perfect crispy skin with zero chew and moist juicy meat. I got a bunch of the appetizers, they were all great, Reuben air bread, cheese in the middle is amazing.  Beef around a bread stick was great.  Tomato tar tar which was nice and the lightest thing eaten by us. Sloppy joes were good, but not worth the room it takes up in your stomach because your about to have the best meat you have ever had.  The first time I went, we got a ribeye ns a ny strip and we all proffered the strip that time.  This time the ribeye was absolutely incredible, we had a wagyu bread from rosemont Texas and it was insanely good and tender.  Being a steak lover from NY, Lugers or wolfgangs arr my top at home, but I would take this over those and day.  Absolutely incredible feasting.",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat is a fantastic metaphor for Las Vegas: a beautiful excess of treasures from around the world, jammed into an absurdly hip place complete with absurdly expensive drinks. While the prices might seem excessive, 7 of us ate until we were nearly sick, each had a cocktail, split a bottle of wine, and the bill split 6 ways was around $180 each after tax and auto gratuity. For the sheer quantity of food it would have been an amazing deal, but it was the quality that made this seem like a bargain.  The restaurant is in essence 5 kitchens all serving 1 space so the menu spans from a raw bar, to molecular gastronomy, all the way to meats over a fire pit. Everything, with the exception of the little starters, is designed to be shared. I'd suggest ordering 1 meat, 1 side, the Robuchon Potatoes, and 2-3 starters per 2-3 people. We obliterated that and our stomach paid the price.  Do not miss: Cotton Candy Foie: Such an interesting delicious bite and a great way to start the meal. Beef and Parmesan Grissini: Tender savory beef draped over breadsticks and served with the most amazing parmesan dipping sauce. S'mores: S'mores stuffed with Foie Gras. It's is as delicious as you think it is weird, which should be a lot. Robuchon Potatoes: Fabulous butter sauce with a drizzle of potato. We had 2 orders for 7 guys. Lamb Neck: What a steal, tender and packed with earth flavor and it comes with fried oysters!  Totally Worth It: Quarter Suckling Pig: If you dine on swine it might not get better than this. I prefer the skin on Chinese roast pork, but the flavor of the pork is unbeatable. Rosewood Ribeye: It's a giant Ribeye... Enough said. Both Croquetas: Perfectly fried potato treats, but I'd go with the Jamon if you have to pick. Classic Tartre: Another great value here, the portion is MASSIVE. Creamy and eggy served with warm fresh rolls. Roasted Leeks: A nice break from meat and the bite helps clear the palate.  Missable: Foieffle: How to ruin Foie Gras, cover it with peanut butter. All you can taste is the peanut butter! Giant Chicharron: Its fun to smash and the dipping sauce was great. But there isn't anything special about it.  Well I hope that helps anyone who was trying to decide what to order. There is so much to try here that I might just have to come back!",

If you come here, please make sure you order their meat items! +Fresh West Coast Oysters: These were so good.  You get a choice of east coast or west coast oysters.  I always do west coast because they're smaller and sweeter.  To each their own on this.  You can't go wrong with fresh oysters! -Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Looks really cool, make sure to order one per person.  Foie that is encased in cotton candy.  The sweet cotton candy is in stark contrast to the salty foie, not something we'd order again.   -Croquetas de Pollo: This was okay, basically tasted like a fried chicken pot pie. -Sloppy Joe: I thought this was just okay.  My friend who loves hamburgers liked this but really, I think for such a nice and fancy place, you could order something better. +Flat Iron: Very flavorful and tender.  It was our favorite cut of meat from the three we ordered.   +Skirt Steak: Also good and tender but flat iron was better (our whole table of 8 agreed) +Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Very unctuous and delicious.  There was no gameness and possibly the most tender beef cheeks I've ever had.  +Service: Excellent service.  The waitress kept checking on us.  -Pricey: Or course it is!  -Cocktails: this was just OK.  We tried one with passionfruit and another one that has mescal, both were unimpressive.  Tips: 1.  Make a reservation if possible 2.  Order the meat as soon as you sit down, it takes time. I want to try the suckling pig next time and it takes a full hour to cook 3.  Come hungry!  We were so bummed we couldn't eat more and try more. 4.  Don't come with cheapskates 5.  Dress up",

    "text": "A five-star review for a five-star restaurant. I came expecting innovative cuisine and we found a clever mixture of invention and classics.  We started with the cotton candy foie gras, a lollypop-sized delight on a stick that we were instructed to eat in one bite. It was a surprising interplay of textures and temperatures, the warmth of the dissolving sugar against the creamy coolness of the foie gras. It set the expectation levels high for the meal.  Next up was the chicharron, delivered in a huge piece, dusted with za'atar, and broken up into smaller chunks. It was so fresh that it continued to snap, crackle and pop throughout the rest of the dinner. Delicious.  We had to get the olives ala Ferran Adria, beautifully executed and exciting. And this was something I appreciated: Andres borrowed techniques from other chefs...and then gave them credit for coming up with the dish. It's something I don't remember seeing in the past and it was a respectful move.  We also enjoyed the \"traditional\" steak tartare -- not crafted at the table but presented in a bowl alongside a tray of mini brioche buns topped with sea salt. My sweetie, who is not a fan of tartare, pronounced it was the \"best he's ever had.\"  We chose the beef rib-eye from Mindful Meats in California, primarily because we've driven by the farm several times and wanted to try aged meat from a \"local\" ranch. I like my beef rare and was able to find many quite rare pieces in our \"medium rare\" grilled steak, carved and presented alongside the bone. We asked for salt and the coarse flakes were an excellent addition.  The price for the meats is by the ounce, so in addition to choosing your protein and its source, you also need to have an idea of how many ounces you'd like for your steak...and your waitress/waiter will need to check and see if a steak that size is available.  We also chose the mashed potatoes (ala Joel Rubuchon) that were just loaded with delicious butter and the roasted carrots served on a bed of yogurt sauce.  The wine list is interesting and (very!) expensive -- some of the wines were priced at 10 times more than what they are priced at retail. That said, we had a lovely bottle of pinot noir for under $100, one of the few available at that price point. But then, if you're spending all that money on the food, I guess they figure a few more dollars won't hurt.   The room fits the modern and sleek atmosphere of the SLS and the staff was attentive and professional. And be sure to go up and check out the delicious cuts of beef, dry aging in a case by the kitchen. Now that's a decoration I can get behind!",

    "text": "This is a long over due review but I just got the Meathead Badge and out of all the places I've been to meat related speaking this is one of my top 5 restaurants.   I came here initially for a friends birthday. Just a heads up no basic group of friends can come here for a birthday dinner because let's just say not everyone has a thick enough pocket. As a first timer here it was only right to order one of the beef rib steaks. I'll post a picture of the one I got. Pricing was done by the pound so don't let the 60, 70, 95 etc fool you. The server stated on average these steaks are 2.5lbs. However, have no fear if you don't have the appetite or someone to share it with like me they do have \"no so big guys\" section. If you do go with the steak got be ready to wait for it to be prepared to perfection. Perfection takes time but when your with the right people the time will pass quickly. We tried various appetizer on the menu as a group as well. I can't comment on them because I don't eat pork and they all contained bits and pieces of it. The ones I did try were delicious though. We also order a side of Mac & Cheese as a side and it was the perfect 5 Yelp stars of a serving. As our dinner came to an end the server handed us a red box filled with delicious pastries to go!   If you like meat and you know what a good steak is this is has to be on your list. If you're into outback and generic \"steakhouses\" then take a damn seat elsewhere. This is for people that know what's up. Okay that was kinda stuck up but the truth hurts here & there.",

Most high end shops sell by the gram or oz. but that would take math .  The wine list is amazing but like everyone else in Vegas the mark up is close to 400 %.  I do think it would be better for a large group that could get there large cuts and cut them to fit the size they feel will work. The only other issue is there not very good at cooking the meat they even said they really only do rare and med rare . But there is still a need to get the center hot enough so nothing happens that you don't want to . Tart tart is good but then there are ways to make that safe . All in all a  very trendy place nice people just not a good stake place.",

    "text": "Let me start off by prefacing with the fact that I went to Bazaar Meat on a Saturday night with two other Asian girls and an Asian guy. Now I mention this because I definitely think the host staff was slightly partial to the fact that we were young and Asian. I'm from New York and a frequent visitor to LA and Vegas so I know that the \"scene\" is totally a thing. This restaurant definitely seated guests accordingly in the dining room based on physical appearance and assumed wealth/social status. We had a reservation and arrived early, but ended up waiting almost 30 min past our reservation to be seated.  That being said...  The restaurant is beautiful! The entrance is open and the bar is directly behind the host stand. Right when you walk in, you see the open kitchen and large slabs of meat that are on display. There is modern taxidermy on display, beautiful whimsical wallpaper. The restaurant is very ornate, dark and sultry.  We were seated towards the back of the restaurant near a large semi-private dining room. The menu is a little overwhelming as it comes out on one sheet on a large double sided \"board\" so to say. It took us a while to go through it and actually decide what we wanted to order.  The chicken croquettes were brought out to our table on the house for the reservation mishap. They came out in a frosted glass sneaker and to my surprise were absolutely delicious! So creamy and savory - I would order them again. We also got the bagel and lox cones and the classic beef tartare. The bagel and lox cones were nothing special, but the beef tartare was to die for. So melt in your mouth flavorful. I also remember getting some crunchy bread sticks with prosciutto and this cheesy dip, which I no longer see on the menu, but that cheesy dip was awesome.  For the main course, we got a large ~32oz cut of the most expensive bone in ribeye to share, with mushrooms and Brussels sprouts as sides. Maybe I wasn't very hungry, but I thought the steak was nothing special. Still good though. The mushrooms were good, but didn't blow me away. However, the Brussels sprouts were so delicious! It was a beautiful dish. They came with \"lemon air\" - basically what it sounds like it was frothy lemon infused air bubbles (like bath suds but obviously edible) that sat on top of the dish of Brussels sprouts. It was fun and whimsical!  Overall:  Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Decor 5/5  Bazaar meat is definitely a restaurant that'll put a dent in your wallet, but I'd definitely go back again!",

    "text": "Several reasons factor into this rating: Sat at the bar and the service was very good. Water glass never got more than half empty, but the bartenders were not pushy which is a big no no for me. This place is VERY EXPENSIVE, but I had a rough week and decided to treat myself. Started out with the Tartare Classic. Not sure of the cut of beef but it was incredibly tender with a nice balance of onion, capers & egg yolk. I then had the bone in veal chop, medium rare and button mushrooms with garlic, parley & butter. The veal chop came out nicely presented. The bone was cut off and sat atop the cut veal. My primary complaint was that it came out rare. It also seemed to be a very fatty piece of meat which veal seldom is. The parts I ate were flavored nicely but there was a lot not touched. To Pay $42 for about 10-12 ounces of meat and to not have it cooked to perfection is a bit of a crime. This place has a great reputation and any restaurant will have a dish or tow come out not perfect, but I doubt I will return.",

    "text": "Very solid meal. I am a huge Andreas fan after eating at Bazaar Hollywood and China Poblano. I had huge hopes for this place and it pretty much come through. A few things were disappointing hence 4 stars and not 5.   Great ambiance. We got to sit in front of the open grill area and meat counter. Awesome display of meat.   Cocktails were tasty. Food was really good but I've had slightly better meat elsewhere.   Steak tartare was on point but a little weird serving it with buttered soft rolls. The butter overpowered it and tartare was better by itself. Prefer when servers with a plain thin cracker vehicle. Cool that it was served tableside.   Can't come to Bazaar and not get the fois gras cotton candy pops. Yummy   Got the Charcuterie chefs platter and it was slightly disappointing. The Iberico ham was amazing and I always love Spanish Chorizo. 5 other meats of which 1-2 we didn't love. They had mortadella which was cut about an inch thick and wasn't too good. I love mortadella but it's always sliced paper thin not sure why they went that route on preparation.   So many options for steak. We went with the Rosewood Ribeye and split it for two. More than enough meat for both of us. At $75/lb it cost a little over two hundred bucks. It was good but I've had big tomahawk or porterhouse for two type steak that tasted just as good elsewhere for $100 less. It also needed more salt.   Service was great and at the end of the day you done for the experience and the meat so I'm not too disappointed with the slightly high prices.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Mixed emotions. Food at times stellar, at times ordinary.  Set menu service too rushed. Wine list exorbitant.   The full skinny:  We were very excited to try a Jose Andres restaurant for the first time, and Bazaar Meat seemed right up our alley. We showed up on time for our reservation and were immediately shown to our table by a stunning and friendly hostess from Hawaii. Loved the uniforms! Walking through the restaurant is an experience in and of itself, with the open kitchen steaming away and the cool lighting and decor in the dining room.   We were seated and after consideration decided to have the \"Jose's Way\" tasting menu at $185 per person. Surprisingly there was no available wine pairing, so we were forced to make a selection from a list that can only be described as obscenely expensive. The promised assistance of a sommelier never happened, so we settled on one of the most \"modestly priced\" wines on the list, a Spanish red, and our choice was actually complimented by the person who came to open and pour. The wine turned out to be very nice and a great accompaniment to our meal, if overpriced.   Shortly thereafter, the courses started to arrive, and arrive they did, with a quickness! At one point we had three courses sitting on the table waiting for us before we even had a chance to try the first. It detracted from the experience because we felt very rushed. This actually happened twice during the meal. A food runner would drop off a plate, rush through a description, and leave. When spending $300 per person (with wine) for a meal, one would hope for the pacing of the courses to be more spread out. It was so bad that at one point we even asked our server to make sure the kitchen didn't fire our steak too soon for us to enjoy it while hot. She accommodated this request but the experience still felt overly rushed, especially at this price point.   The food itself ranged from the ordinary (the \"smoked\" oyster was overwhelmed by the foam that came on top; the steak tartare, which I was really anticipating, was over-sauced to the point that the meat could not really be tasted, but the Parker House rolls accompanying were fantastic; the cauliflower \"steak\" that accompanied the meat was dry and plain;) to the sublime (the beefsteak tomato \"tartare\" was a revelation and our entree rib steak was among the best I have ever tasted, and of course the foie gras with cotton candy was stunning.)   Service was efficient if not overly accommodating. We asked our server where they were sourcing such excellent tomatoes in December. She returned a bit later and said \"well the chef is really busy right now but he told me 'California.'\" Not exactly the answer I was looking for or expected from an organization known for attention to every detail in their dishes.  The bottom line is that while I did have very high expectations and many of them were met, I could not escape feeling that I was dining in a \"celebrity chef\" restaurant on an assembly line. If I do go back, and I will not rule that out, I would definitely tell the server to make sure the courses don't come from the kitchen too quickly and will also investigate their corkage policies so that we don't feel like we are being fleeced on the wine selections. I enjoyed the overall experience (aside from feeling rushed) but can't escape the nagging feeling that we paid too much.",

    "text": "Had to try this distinguished chef's taste menu based on all the reviews and was not disappointed.  Location: inside the casino of SLS hotel (final stop on the monorail), easy to find.  Ambience: clean, new, comfortable, classy environment.  Nice dining room and very elegant bar areas with adequate number of smaller tables and booths and lounge chairs about.  Food: 2 of us ordered the cheapest $125 tasting menu and it was fantastic. Giant pork-skin Chicharron: the best I ever had, it came out freshly prepared and you can still hear the pork skin crackling in the serving container!  Flavor was just right and not overly salty.  I especially love the light and fluffy Greek yogurt that came with it for dipping. Bagels & lox cone: very artistic and yummy, I love anything that's lox, salmon roe and cream cheese.  When they combined all 3 together the flavor was just intense, culinary orgasm perhaps:) Olives: there were 2 types: the traditional Gordal olives stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy was good, but the liquid green olive was interesting in a good way.  The texture was almost like a mini egg yolk, was that the inside of an olive?  Beef Tenderloin: even though it's not the best cut of meat, it was the best beef tenderloin I ever had!  Perfectly sliced into 5 portions, the outside was slightly charred and medium salty, inside was medium rare, juicy and I could taste the flavor of good aged beef.  This tells me the chef and the staff went to great length to prepare, cook and served the meat properly.  Kudos!!   Croquetas de pollo: it was good, piping hot, tasty and creamy inside, served in a sneaker-like container The classic tartare: after all the pleasant surprises that came before it, it was a let down, nothing special, served in cold house rolls Lucia's salad: Caesar salad served on a big lettuce leaf, it was ok Grilled asparagus: it was ok Robuchon potatoes: it was wonderful, lots of butter so beware Desserts: wonderful  Service: it was a Friday night, there were no tables available so we set at one of the smaller tables near the bar area.  The servers were pleasant and attentive to our needs.  Price: we did not order any drinks, so it was $135.31 each including tax (for the $125 tasting menu), excluding tips.   Conclusion: Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres at SLS lived up to its billing.  Would definitely return, perhaps will try the $185 or even the $275 menu next time.",

    "text": "I've always wanted to go to Bazaar Meat, but it's a little out of our price range. Thanks to Restaurant Week, my husband and I had a high-end dinner experience for two for less than $300. ($80 each per meal, $25 each for wine parings, and a hefty tip.)  The food, most of  which was excellent, was served tapas style. In order, our favorites were as follows:  Buttered potato puree (TONS of butter!) Roasted padron peppers (charred and full of flavor) Cotton candy foie gras (a specialty of the house) Albondigas (can't go wrong with meatballs!) Wagyu and kobe beef slices, cooked on a hot rock (one was way too fatty for me; guess my palate isn't that refined) Ribeye steak (well seasoned, but undercooked) Tomato bread (good, but nothing special) Reuben airbread (interesting idea, but kind of a letdown) Brussel sprouts \"petals\" (another interesting idea; ditto on the letdown) Assorted desserts (creative plating, but too sweet for us)  Yes, you read that right. At a renowned steak house, our favorite two dishes were peppers (him) and mashed potatoes (me). The steak was good, of course, but we both ordered them medium rare, and mine was almost blue. Solved that problem by scarfing down the sides and taking the beef home to reheat later!  The wine pairings were a sparkling Cava, a delicious red (wish I had gotten the name), and a serviceable Port. Service was quick and efficient, and even though our waiter said there might be a wait on the main course because it's cooked to order, we were in and out in a reasonable amount of time.  If you can afford it, by all means try Bazaar Meat any time of the year. But if you're more budget-conscious (like me!), wait until next year's Restaurant Week to catch a bargain.",

    "text": "A few friends and I decided we'd treat ourselves to one fancy dinner over the course of our three-day Vegas trip. One of the party member's best friend raves about this restaurant as her favorite in Vegas, and a friend of mine loves Jose Andres restaurants in the D.C. food scene. But we were really underwhelmed and disappointed here and unfortunately, this meal became a running joke of the trip...hah.  We were on a budget and it's tapas style, so we split 4 different items and a couple of them got two glasses of really delicious Spanish wine. We ordered skirt steak, classic tartare, croquette, and cotton candy foie gras.  We were most excited for the cotton candy foie gras and that turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Even disregarding the price point ($8 for a single, tiny wisp of candy), the execution was disappointing -- there wasn't that care or creativity you'd expect from someone like Jose Andres. Rather than incorporate the foie gras into the floss, a smidge of it is placed on the tip of the stick. So you don't get to the good stuff until you reach the center. It's quite literally less than a tea spoon of foie gras smeared at the center of average cotton candy. Not really as appealing or fun as it could be!  The skirt steak was amazing and really tender and marinated perfectly. But lots of places have good steak, so this to me was not mind blowing or really worth noting in comparison to all the other just as great options out there.   We also really enjoyed the meaty croquette, although super small portions. As in, you can prop one on the tip of your pinky. Perfectly fried though and rich, creamy center was very complimentary.   As for the tartare, they mix it table-side and ask one of the party members to taste test it for seasoning. At least two of us thought it ended up being too salty, a bit overwhelming in flavor. I think I would have preferred the staff to just present it as they'd like, so there would be more quality control. I think it's hard to gauge what \"more seasoning\" can mean for different people -- what that amounts to.   The service was good though, no complaints there. There was a huge, baller table next to us who were having a feast, but the four of us were still pleasantly attended to throughout the meal.  Side note, apparently in the men's bathroom, you can watch yourself sh*t in the mirror/reflection...",

Everything except the main course is to share \"small plates\" but they weren't tiny like you'd expect.   We started with the Lucia's Salad (Caesar), it was robust and full of delicious Parmesan. Then we were presented with the Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron which was HUGE. we didn't find it amazingly flavorful and the Greek yogurt didn't do anything for me but overall it was interesting and fun. Next we enjoyed the Croquetas de Jamon, it was by far the best croquette I've ever had. It was cheesy and gooey but crisp on the outside. I would have ordered another round if I didn't have a ton of food coming afterward. Lastly of our appetizers was the Romaine on Ice, you would think it was boring, but they salt the radish leaves and with the ranch, I wanted more AGAIN.   For our main entrees we ordered the Flat-Iron Steak and the Skirt steak. Both were prepared medium rare. Both came with their own sauce and both were PERFECT.  Excellent service, excellent food, excellent cocktails.   I wasn't offended then the check arrived, although it's not a cheap dinner, I think it's well worth it.",

    "text": "By far one of the best meals - and the best steak - I've ever had. I was in town for business and made reservations for myself and a few colleagues when we scheduled the trip. Entering the restaurant sets the tone for the evening perfectly: an open kitchen fronted by a counter with deli-style glass cases containing beautiful, mostly massive, cuts of beef, and directly behind it two wood-burning open grills. Everything here is about the meat, including our waiter's initial directions to select our cuts as soon as possible, lest they run out.  We started with the Croquetas de Jamon, Patatas Bravas, and Jamon Iberico de Bellota for the table, and the Cotton Candy Foie Gras for two of us. All of it was absolutely delicious, as can be expected, but the Cotton Candy Foie Gras was a particularly sublime experience - perhaps the best single bite of food (and it's just one bite) that I've ever had. This is a piece of cool foie gras - seared, I think - on a skewer, twirled through fresh warm cotton candy and served on the skewer like a miniature cotton candy stick. You're instructed to eat it all in one bite, and I barely have words to describe the ensuing experience - the warm, sweet cotton candy melting in your mouth, followed by the cool, rich foie gras.  As an entree I had the 28-ounce Vaca Vieja (8- to 10-year-old Holstein) ribeye. It was beautifully grilled as expected - a perfect medium rare with a delicious, oh-so-thin charred-black exterior - and had a delicious depth of flavor that I've never tasted in beef before.  All together, an amazing experience with suitably amazing food.",

    "text": "*This review is for happy hour in the bar. We did not eat in the main restaurant*  I am a huge fan of Jose Andres and was so looking forward to eating here. It really pains me to only leave 3 stars but that is how we felt about the food, just ok.   First off, I wish this restaurant was at a different hotel. The SLS is so run down and was practically empty when we came in on a Sunday evening. Bazaar meat is located in the back of the casino and the reception desk is oddly very far back from the entrance.   We were the first ones to arrive so had our choice of seats in the bar area. I liked the white decor and the blood dripping down from the bar ceiling, very unique. Our server came right over and was very attentive. She explained all the dishes on the bar menu and we had a glass of the house red ($8) which was described as a \"Pinot\". It was awful. The rest of the wines are extremely high priced here, even for a strip restaurant.   Here is what we ordered:  Pork skin Chicharron w/ greek yogurt  (2/5) Kobe beef air bread w/ onion jam and parmesan creme (3/5) sloppy joe w/ fried potatoes and steamed bun  (2/5) Grilled pulpo. Galician style octopus (3/5) Suckling pig sandwich. Crispy skin, carmelized onions, honey mustard (2/5)  Dark chocolate almond eclair (4/5)  The chicharron was disappointing. Almost completely flavorless without the dipping sauce. I wanted it a little thicker instead of being like air. The kobe beef airbread was good. A super thin slice of meat over the onion jam (which I wish was stronger), filled with a  parmesan creme. The sloppy joe was okay, but nothing great. The octopus was good flavor wise, but cooked completely uneven, Im pretty sure it was just warmed up as some of the pieces were not even warm. I was really underwhelmed with the suckling pig sandwich. The bread was great but the meat lacked any flavor and I had a couple big chunks of fat. Finally, the eclair was a good ending.   I was hoping to return for dinner in the restaurant but I honestly don't think I will. I had high expectations but the food was just disappointing. I also have no desire to return to SLS. Sorry Jose :(",

If you want a smattering of all offerings and don't want to think about it, go with a tasting menu. The dishes come out quickly but the pace didn't feel rushed (I guess I was really hungry).  There are a lot of interesting takes on the classics and I'll admit, the cotton candy foie gras is more novelty than a complex or elevated dish but it shows you the inventiveness of Jose Andrees. On the other hand the \"taco\" was sublime.",

    "text": "This is one of the foodie's destinations in Vegas. I went with a very high expectations and came out surprised and delighted. Jose Andres has done a very good in blending fine Spanish cooking into the American steakhouse.   My two friends and I ordered a lot more food than we should but were able to finish everything because it's delicious. We tried the Vaca Vieja rib-eye tasting, a small 6oz portion from a rather aged dairy cow, which rather firm but very flavorful. The texture allowed the taste to be savored for a longer time. Chateaubriand Tenderloin is also very nice and suits my companion's preference.   The highlight of the night was the Secreto iberico de Bellota, which is a fine pork from Spain. It's unusual to have ordered pork at a steakhouse but this little piggy has definitely stolen the shoe. With a wonderful balance of texture and taste, every bite is pure joy. There is a certain degree of fat in the chop. The lard sparks inside my mouth, leaving only taste, flavor, but not grease. Given this delightful surprise, I had an extra order of the cured meat version of the same pork - the Jamon Iberico de Bellota. It's very rich in flavor, extremely tasty, and pairs very well with a Sparkling Rose that Joseph recommended, . The ham tasted the same as the same kind that I had tried earlier while traveling in Europe. Though it's not a surprise anymore, it doesn't disappoint.  My server of the night was Joseph M (Joe), who is kind, friendly, and has excellent knowledge on the food and wine. He has taken every possible step to ensure a great dinner for me, and his attentive service has definitely elevated my experience.   This is a one of a kind dining experience, especially for foodies. With this, I will not fancy any other place in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place. Oh my gosh. So freaking good.   First off, the decor is really cool. It's not really matching, but there are similar elements that carry on throughout. The kitchen is open so you can see not only the cuts of meat you're getting, but you can also watch them prepare and cook it. It's really neat!  We had cocktails to start, then split a bottle of wine between the 4 of us (based off our server's recommendations once we picked the entree). Our meal was intense. So, they recommended ordering our main course first as it takes 45-60 minutes to cook the meat. We did that, then we started with cotton candy foie gras and this weird olive dish. Not going to lie, the cotton candy foie gras was my least favorite part of the meal. The olive dish was pretty cool. It came with a tin of olives, stuffed with something amazing, and these weird bubbles of olive juice. The olives were so good! And the little bubbles of juice kind of burst in your mouth. Don't order this if you're not into olives, cause it's very olive-y. So then we got one of the beef carpaccio's (the one that comes with parmesan) and the classic beef tartare. I could have skipped the tartare, but I could honestly go back just for the carpaccio. It was so freaking good. For the main course, we got the Lindsey Ranch beef rib steak, cooked to chef's preference. We got grilled baby corn, cauliflower steak, and the super butter, butter, butter potatoes. Everything was to share, so we got to try it all. All of it was amazing. For dessert, they brought out this little platter of deliciousness.   This was easily one of the best meal experiences I've had since moving to Vegas. The service was great, the food was great, the decor is neat... It was just really fun! Not cheap though.",

He was spot on in terms of how much to order and his recommendations were excellent. The strip loin steak was done perfectly. The pulpo was excellent and the candy floss foie gras was awesome!  The Rueben with Kobe beef was really good. We ordered the creamy mashed potatoes and it was decadent with lots and lots of butter!  However we balanced that with a very light brussel sprout hot salad with apricots and grapes. Great meal overall!",

    "text": "We dined here on Monday, 11/13/17.  I only wanted to give 3 stars but my friends couldn't stop raving and raving about the suckling pig. I don't eat pork, but I will take their word that this was the best pork they ever had. I'm sure glad they liked it because it was $160 for a 1/4 suckling pig from Spain. We also tried the wagyu rib of eye ($160) and the wagyu from Rosewood, TX ($206). Both were good, but not amazing. The highlight of the evening had to be the mashed potatoes - wow can you say butter? Yum! Surprisingly, the sloppy joe was the best sloppy joe I've ever had! The meat was tasty and the bread was perfectly crispy and buttery. My friends fell in love with the cotton candy foie gras and ordered a 2nd round. I wasn't a fan of the cotton candy but the foie gras itself was a bite of buttery perfection. We also had the geoduck, the king crab cocktail, brussels sprouts and asparagus. Nothing really stood out. Do yourself a favor and do not order the brussels sprouts - it was very bland and the leaves were wilted. One positive I want to point out is the knowledgeable and attentive staff. Our server and restaurant manager gave us their undivided attention.",

The first one was served a little bit cold, but the worst part was that we felt the quality just wasn't there. The first cut was really hard and the second cut had a lot of fat. On top of that the portions for the appetizers were really small, and had to order multiple ones so we could enjoy more than one croquette per person. Be prepared to pay a premium for having Jose Andres name. When the bill came it was over 600 dollars for the 5 of us and they included a 20% tip \"for your convenience\". I would definitely not recommend this place to a friend. Way overpriced for what you get.",

    "text": "I went to Bazaar Meat, for dinner, on my trip to Las Vegas last month.  This place is top notch and I was not disappointed at all.  It is in the SLS hotel.    We got there a little earlier, so we went to the bar.  The bar has nice and unique decor.  They have some fancy and unique cocktails.  I had a drink where they pour over cotton candy, and the cotton candy acts like the sugar.  My friend had a drink where they burn cider wood and they trap the smoke and it added a smokey flavor to the whisky.  And lastly, my other friend ordered a drink where they poured on a ball of ice and it smoked up.    For dinner, we ordered 3 of the tasting menus, so we can share the same experience; and our waiter said that if there was something that we did not want, he would be happy to trade it with something on another menu.    The highlight of the whole dinner, for all of us, was that we wanted to try the Kobe Beef.  (Just an FYI, at the time of this review, there are only 9 restaurants in the whole US that serve authentic Kobe Beef) and they give you a certificate of authenticity as proof.    Even if you don't get the tasting menu, they have prime meat and a great menu that I would like to try.  I highly recommend this restaurant.",

The Reuben: Probably one of my FAVES... The first bite is an explosion of WOW!!! Must try!!!   Grilled Oysters: These were good but nothing too special about the flavor. Typical oyster dish.   Morcilla with Uni: Another one of my FAVES!!! If you're an Uni lover, this is a must try. The combination of sea urchin and blood sausage is fantastic!   Buttered Potato Puree: SINFUL! That is all.   Roasted Leeks: Delicious! Went very well with the steak and potatoes.   American Wagyu: At $75/lb, this was melt in your mouth, holy cow, FANTASTIC!!! So flavorful and soft and buttery and tender and just all around WOW!!!   Complimentary Birthday Dessert: Let's just say, the plate was empty in less than 5 minutes. Lol!

    "text": "This review will cover the experience of my first visit but the food of both of my visits.   I have been to the Bazaar in LA multiple times, so when I finally had a chance to go try Bazaar Meat in Las Vegas, I couldn't pass it up. It's located in the newly re-designed SLS hotel in the corner of the hotel. Right outside of the restaurant there is a gigantic lit up \"LIFE\" for all those basic instagram'ers out there.   I got in at 5:30pm, right when they opened so they told me to hang out at the bar. I ordered the Passion Up cocktail (which I couldn't find the second time). This drink is truly unique, that passion fruit foam is amazing, and the drink itself was a perfect combination of sweet, tarty and strong too. Too bad I had a busted lip at the time so it burned every time I had a sip, but it was worth it.  Before I got to finish the drink, they told me that my table for 1 was ready. Just a heads up, if you order from the bar, you have to close the tab at the bar, so might be easier just to wait to get the drink at the table next time.   Once I was seated, I was overwhelmed by this gigantic menu and additional tasting menus, which made the decision to pick what I wanted to eat even more difficult. Given that I was eating alone, I had to pick the best of the best. (I only realized there was a back side to the gigantic menu on my second visit, wow...)  (Food is a combination of my two visits, no I did not eat all this alone)  Sea Urchin: A super light starter, really fresh uni and you can really taste the ginger. I'm starting to like uni more and more so I definitely enjoyed this dish.  Croquetas de Pollo: I only got this for the shoe, have tried this at the LA location but it was really creamy, had the perfect crunch to it and a really nice contrasting texture. Another really good starter to share.  Beef & Parmesan Grissini: Got this both visits, comes with 5 sticks so perfect for sharing and that cheese sauce is sooooo good and cheesy. At first, I was pretty stingy about using the sauce, but I had to add more and more once I realized how good it was. The washugyu beef has a really good texture to it and flavor, definitely one of my favorites.  Classic Tartare: Got this both visits as well, they show you the dish at first and then someone mixes everything for you and puts it on a marble plate, served with 6 dinner rolls which are perfect to eat with the tartare. The flavor was amazing, with all the sauces, one of my favorite dishes as well.   Rosewood, Wagyu/Black Angus Steak: Minimum order was 3lbs so we shared it among 5 people and wow, this was pretty good steak. Not sure if it was worth the price point, but I can definitely appreciate a good piece of meat. They serve it to you two different ways so you can try each of the flavors.   Robuchon: They aren't kidding when they said butter, butter and more butter with some potatoes. This is probably the creamiest, most delicious mashed potatoes I've ever had. One of my friends even got a dish with regular mash potatoes and her didn't stand a chance. Definitely need to share as it is very filling, perfect to go along with any of the other steaks.   Morcilla with Uni: Probably the most plain dish of the night, thought I would try something else with uni, but the blood sausage overpowered the dish with it's flavor and texture.   Now to the last two and my two MUST GETS (if you like foie gras):   The Foieffle: Air waffle, foie espuma, peanut butter and honey, how can you go wrong with this?? When you cut up the waffle in half, the ooze from the peanut butter and honey comes out so be careful! This combination is an orgasm in your mouth. I could have eaten 2-3 easily.   S'mores: A play off the classic S'mores from those good ol' bonfire nights. Foie Gras, Chocolate, Marshmallow, Graham Crackers. You get 4 per dish and I would make sure you cherish each one. After I finished the first two, I could help but wanting to save the last two. And when you finish the last one, you just want another order. It's a never ending cycle so make sure you're ready to stop all the urges.  Service was amazing both trips, super professional and respectful staff. They made both experiences amazing for me and I will definitely be back. One of the waiters, John, talked about a tasting menu for $150 with a minimum group of 4 people that I have to get. Until next time!",

    "text": "I finally got around to checking out Bazaar Meat after meaning to go here for over a year, and I'm so glad I did! The first thing that drew me in was the overall atmosphere of the place. It's dark with really bizarre decor and a huge fire pit right in the middle of the dining room. I really love the multiple kitchen concept here and as a True foodie, it was super entertaining to watch the chefs busy at work preparing my meal.   The best tip I can give you is that if you come here, BRING MONEY. I mean serious amounts of it. This is NOT a bargain restaurant but I thought the high price tag was worth it. This was not just a meal, it was a very memorable experience.   The service was leisurely paced with just the right amount of friendliness. We decided to go all out with this meal so we ordered multiple courses and brought our own wine ($35 corkage fee). I took a pic of the wine menu since it was surprisingly heavy on big California reds. Worth noting since it's a faux pas to bring a bottle of wine that's already on the menu! The menu is heavy on Spanish influenced cuisine, with a focus on cured meats and giant steaks. This is not the place for picky eaters either, I'd classify most of the menu items as not only adventurous, but downright strange. Get out of your comfort zone and try some of the more wacky menu listings!   The serving styles are pretty inventive too -- the chicken croquetas are served in a fake glass Converse shoe! My favorite menu item of the evening were the cauliflower steak (roasted cauliflower in a very tasty romesco sauce). Yep, delicious! The asparagus were a huge let down and our plate was comprised of mostly the hard, woody stems. Yuck. Nobody likes that part and most of what we were served should've been thrown out. I was also not a fan of the crab and shrimp cocktail and would not order that again. The Chateaubriand was absolutely perfect. It took a while to cook but we were having a blast relaxing in the intimate atmosphere of the place. Since Bazaar Meat specializes in steaks, it goes without saying that the kitchen knows how to cook meat perfectly. We had both medium and medium-rare meat and both were absolutely perfect.   I loved the dessert menu concept (go for the \"Chef's Sampler\" box of mini desserts). They were almost too pretty to eat and tasted great. My favorite thing? The mini cookies, yum! My $6.00 espresso was more than acceptable and was a great way to round out our dinner.  While I'd love to be able to make dining here a habit, the prices will make it only reserved for special occasions. Ask to see the daily tasting menu options too, but be warned: the prices are EVEN HIGHER THAN THE FRENCH LAUNDRY! Yikes!  If you only order one thing here, make it the Robuchon potatoes. They were like eating mashed potato butter icing! Smooth texture and tons of creamy butter-ness!",

    "text": "Not sure where to begin, but, we really had a terrible experience on Sat eve. I would love to know whether other tables who had our waiter may have felt the same way.  Honestly, our waiter felt more like a car salesman than a waiter in a high end steak house. So, lets start w/ appetizers:   Cotton Candy Foie Gras:  should probably just be called Cotton Candy bites.  $8/ea for a little cotton candy on a stick the size of your thumb.  The chicken croquettes were pretty good, have to say!  The Cauliflower was very blah, and there were a few others which were decent.  But, I  really think that when we did not go for the 185.00pp tasting menu, our waiter was actually offended.  He did warn us that he needed to get the big steaks in right away because they take 55 minutes.  OK, seems like a lot, but, we were fine with that.  So, he got our steak orders in, then, came back to get our side dish orders.  The side dishes started coming out about 15 min later, and an hour later, we still did not have our steaks which ended up taking over 1 hour and 20 minutes.  There were 13 of us.  3 of us shared the Denver Ribeye which was the highlight of the evening.   ONLY 3 of us enjoyed our meal.  others ordered the Chateu Briand and the skirt steak.  The skirt steak was cold, the Chateu Briand bland and also, not to temp.  Meanwhile, our waiter (i cannot remember his name, Hassan maybe?) was nowhere to be seen throughout the majority of eve completely unattentive.    So, the skirt steaks were sent back and came back a little better, but, not much.  (At least those were taken off the bill).  so, after muscling through disappointing dinner service, we ordered some cookies for desert.  these cookies literally took over 20-25 minutes to come.  And, all throughout the evening, this is what we were dealing with.    and, really, there was no acknowledgement, no real attempts to placate, and we ultimately just felt completely mad, unsatisfied and taken for granted.  $1900 tab for 13 of us, and, they automatically add 20% gratuity which, after balking to a manager, was happy to remove.    The bright spot on the service team was the Somallier who did a great job!     Lastly, they do not even filter their drinking water.  So, expect a nasty chlorine smell/taste if you don't order bottled water. Hopefully, they do not use that water to prepare any food!  All in all, after all of the positive reviews, we were so disappointed! hopefully, they just were having a bad night, but, proceed with caution in this place.",

They have huge grills cooking hunks of meat and the delectable aroma of those meats cooking  permeating throughout the area.  Or large group at in a private dining area and they had room enough to seat more than 25 of us, comfortably.  Great food, great ambiance and great wines! One of our very special evenings in Vegas!",

We started by ordering a beautiful bottle of Italian red (chianti, my favorite). We ordered way too much food but we wanted to try everything. The beef tartare was huge and made table side. It was served with these little buttery pieces of bread heaven clouds, they even brought more after I scarfed down 6 (not proud of that). We also had the gazpacho shooters, sloppy joes and last but not least the foie gras cotton candy. I was sure the foie gras cotton candy was going to be a gimmick but it was literally indescribable, they were like little foie gras cotton candy explosion for your mouth. After all those starters we still had to eat our main, a giant piece of wagyu beef. Cooked perfectly, every piece melted in my mouth. Just when I thought I'd need to be carted out in a wheelbarrow they brought a special selection of desserts for my boyfriends birthday. This meal was absolutely perfect in every way, worth every single penny. If you have the opportunity to visit bazar meats it is a must!",

First off the ambiance is warm and inviting.. as someone else mentioned think hunting lodge meets fine dining establishment and the service was great as expected.  Our server was helpful and explained everything nicely, answered any questions, and explained that everything is served family style.    We played it pretty safe, chicken croquette and the giant chicharron for starters.  Croquettes were tasty, the chicharron I thought was a bit bland and could have used a touch more salt directly or in the yogurt dip.  For the mains we ordered a roughly 3lb cut of the Rosewood Angus/wagyu and a quarter suckling pig.  For sides we ordered the Robuchon potatoes, piquillo peppers, and grilled asparagus.  The sides were good, simply prepared and complimented the meats well.    I personally had the strawberry/cream/bacon dessert which I thought was very good.  The meats however is where I'm torn.  I'm asian.. I've consumed quite a bit of roast pork during my time and honestly the suckling pig did not impress.  Also, while the steak was prepared well (simply seasoned and finished with kobe beef fat) easily 40% of the weight was the giant t-rex size rib bone.   Ok not t-rex but it was big, and it didn't dawn on me till later that night that we just paid what.. $70 for essentially nothing.  I mean that's a 16oz dry aged tbone at any other steakhouse.  I don't mind spending the cash for a good meal but I also don't enjoy paying that much for something I can't actually eat.",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres brings life to the Strip's north end. The celebrity chef's whimsical humor and approach to food extends to the dining room with mismatched chairs and jewel adorned crocodile heads lining the long dining room like that of a Guillermo Del Toro movie set. It's an open kitchen restaurant where you can watch experts thinly slice Jamon Iberico, cook proteins in an adjustable wood fired grill, or shuck fresh oysters.  I had the summer tasting menu at $65. It's a bargain coming from one of the most celebrated chefs of Spain; a poor man's intro option to E by Jose Andres. The show starts with crispy chicharron pork skin placed in butcher paper, then cracked table side with a meat mallet and served with a yogurt dip. Next is the nice little tip of the hat to Ferran Adria's olives, modern & traditional, the liquid green olive a sublime Mediterranean explosion. The Bagels & Lox Cone was filled with dill cream and topped with Salmon roe. The Beef Carpaccio wrapped in a long crispy Parmesan Grissini was a like lollypop for grown ups. Scrumptious Jamon Iberico fritters were delicious. Then the bowl of Robuchon whipped potatoes came. The runner described them as butter, more butter, and some potatoes. They were perfect for the blood red Chateaubriand served with a rich brown Perigord sauce for dipping the decadent morsels of meat. The charred asparagus with carbonara sauce made the epic feast an unforgettable dining experience. With excellent service, Bazaar is sure to put you in foodie coma!",

    "text": "Myself and three others went to Bazaar Meat on Friday, June 10th, 2016.  We had a reservation.    THIS WAS THE WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE  I will simply list out the facts.  We arrived on time for the reservation, they said they could not seat us yet.  They had us go to the bar and have some drinks while we wait.  The bar was sticky, tacky, and disgusting.  The bartenders were disorganized, rude, and gave us a general sense that our being there was a burden to them.  I ordered a single shot of Blanton's Bourbon, I did not receive 2oz, yet was charged $28 (!!!!) for the weak, half finger pour of too warm liquor in the wrong type of glass (which stuck to the disgusting bar).  My colleague ordered a mixed drink that cost about $30... it took them about ten minutes to make what we agreed tasted like a free margarita you would receive at a slot machine from a cocktail waitress.  Then, the hostess came buy and told us our table was ready.  She asked us to close out our bar tab and come meet her.  This is bush league.  It's lazy, and a ploy to maximize cash for the bar instead of transferring the bar tab to the table tab to make it convenient for the customer.  So, I had to close my bar tab... which took about ten minutes due to the lazy and inattentive bar staff.  By the time we sat at our table, we were 20 minutes past my reservation time.  There was no reason for this, as the restaurant was clearly not very crowded.    When walking us to the table, I got bumped in to and told to move by several members of the waitstaff.  The waitress proceeded to take us to the very back of the restaurant, and shove us in a small back room, in the very back corner at a table with no table cloth.  This table was disgusting.  Denny's level disgusting.  It was sticky, wobbly and shoved back against the exit to the kitchen.  Waitstaff were constantly bumping in to the back of my chair as thy exited the kitchen.  Also, there was some sort of raw bar there... it smelled like rancid fish.  Absolutely gross.  The waitress brought us our menus.  These ridiculous menus are giant pieces of plexiglass with a paper menu inside them.  When I say giant, I mean you couldn't fit them on the table.  Also, they were GROSS.  Covered in fingerprints, just as sticky as the table... disgusting.  I felt I needed to wash my hands after using them, except the bathroom was about 2000 feet away through the gauntlet of rude waitstaff, out the front door, through some empty private gaming room that smelled like someone just took bong rips in it... and it was just as disgusting as the rest of the experience.    The menu here is ridiculous and complicated and the staff is not able to communicate it.  You order your steaks first, everything is family style, and when my father placed an order for $600 worth of A5 Kobe beef, they didn't even explain to him that it apparently comes out raw and needs to be cooked on hot rocks they bring you.  Which is a fun and neat thing, but the waitstaff should be forthcoming with that information.  The waitress took one order for our first steak, then interrupted us while we were trying to order more stuff, and promptly disappeared for about ten minutes.  At this point we had been in the establishment for about 35 minutes.  All we had was some water... room temp water at that.  When the waitress finally came back, we proceeded to order at least $1600 worth of food and a $400 bottle of wine.  We were starting to think this was a mistake.  The waitress left, and NOTHING for 15 more minutes.  Time in restaurant thus far, at least 50 minutes.  No food, no drinks, just room temp water and a sticky, wobbly table.  Finally, we decided we were going to ask any staff member that would acknowledge us for another table.  Our table was too gross, and the smell from the raw bar in the room was awful.  Finally, the sommelier showed up with our wine bottle.  I stopped him from opening it and asked him (very politely I might add) to see if it was possible to seat us elsewhere.  He rolled his eyes at us, and pointed to another gross table right next to us and said, \"we can maybe put you there...\"  Then he just walked away.  Then, we waited for ten more minutes.  The waitress came by, and asked how we were doing.  We were simply sitting there with some water.  We have been in the restaurant for an hour.  We told her we needed to switch tables or we were leaving (again, as politely as possible).  She said she would see what she could do and she left.   Ten more minutes went by.  Finally, we gave up.  We stood up and started walking out.  Someone who appeared to be a restaurant manager intercepted us and told us another table was being prepared.  I told him that it was too late.  We were in there for over an hour and had nothing but a ruined night.  They also cancelled my reservation on OpenTable to prevent me from reviewing them there.  That is borderline fraud.  Worst restaurant experience of my life.",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat hits all my reasons to try a restaurant...it offers foods preparation techniques and equipment I don't have, foods I haven't tried, and foods I can't find even in gourmet grocery stores. While I was amazed at the vast variety of meats, I was equally impressed by the variety of vegetables and how well they were prepared.    My biggest criticisms: needing to close out the bar tab to start dinner in the dining area. The menu is obnoxious, not the dishes on the menu, but the menu itself. It is heavy and very, very unnecessarily oversized.  Putting two menus end to end on a table made for two, actually extended beyond the table. A little ridiculous and awkward to negotiate since it is a two-sided menu.  I was very careful flipping the menu over, ensuring I would not knock a glass or dish on the floor, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happens often.   Foie gras cotton candy- whimsical fluffy presentation but in actuality a very small, but a very tasty bite.  Got to try it, but probably satisfy my foie gras craving with a different dish, but this popular item is checked off my bucket list.  Chicharron- Fantastic light crispy, not greasy...no gamey smell either.  The Za-atar  seasoning was nice, but maybe a touch more salt.  The yogurt sauce was delicious, creamy yet light and with a slight tang  Braised Beef Cheeks- by far my favorite dish of the evening.  Meat was tender, but the sauce raised the level of the dish.   Suckling pig- just exactly the way I want.  Crispy skin and juicy, tender meat. Definitely a must try.  The inner most meat needed some sort of seasoning I know a sauce would be a distraction for this dish, but maybe providing a little dish of sea salt would be nice.  We asked for salt and it made a huge difference.  Leeks- I always loved leeks, and these leeks were so sweet and tender, and the charred edges were not bitter.     Our waiter was very friendly, yet professional.  He had spot-on suggestions after getting a good feel for our tastes and preferences.  Too many new dishes I want to try but will be back for sure.",

    "text": "The boyfriend surprised me with this place on my Birthday. Because I didn't look at the menu in advance it was a bit overwhelming trying to decide what to get. Our waiter checked on us quite a few times before we were ready to order, then dropped us completely after a table of 8 business men came in. Our glasses were completely empty at one point. Really?  We ordered maybe 6 tapas along with the suckling pig to share. It started on a high note with the cotton candy which is cute and delicious. The olives were very good, both traditional and modern. However the rest are more than forgettable. It was hard to choose a protein with so many options on the menu. But I insisted on getting the sucking pig because hey, who can pass on the dish that is \"heart and soul\" of the restaurant. Big mistake. The first bite was decent. The skin was crispy and the meat was juicy. But the skin turned chewy soon afterwards. At the end of it I felt like I was chewing leather. The pig was oily and heavily seasoned with nothing to balance it out. You can't really eat more than a few bites without feeling sick. The salad came with it had some sort of vinaigrette dressing that was clashing with the flavor of the pig. Let along how visually unappealing of the dish. The only reason I can think of why people love this would be they came with a group and had 2 bites. Those first 2 bites were good indeed.  We got a few things for desert and they are all pretty good and cute. But we're not here for that. Still though I'd give this place a solid 3 stars for its mediocre food if it wasn't for the waiter. He didn't check on us once after we placed our order. Maybe for the large group it was a completely different experience. But If you're a young couple trying out restaurant on a date night, don't come here.",

I felt bad for all the men at our table--we had some ex football players and they were starving when we left.  I had a few glasses of wine and a tiny bit of food and just laughed it off.  None of us wanted to complain because we didn't want our guest of honor to feel bad (he picked the restaurant).  We are not buffet eaters....but the portions for what you are paying is unacceptable.  But maybe we only feel that way because we are over 40?? lolol.  The cool kids might love tiny portions :)",

Nowadays, apparently, it's all about foie gras waffles and cotton candy foie gras and shit. Hello -- regular-ass old meat is SO 2008!!  Anyway, you check your social conscience at the door when you go to a place like this. So I did, and it was a pretty good meal: beef carpaccio sliders, jellied/deconstructed olives, mini bagel ice-cream cones stuffed with lox/roe, ribeye, super-buttery mashed potatoes and mini-elotes.   And then, the piece de resistance....and symbol of all things foodie frou-frou: the foieffle. (That's a foie-gras-waffle...pronounced \"fwaffle,\" as in, \"twatwaffle.\") (As in, only a REAL asshole would order this!!!!)   Yes, a waffle with foie gras baked into it, smothered in peanut butter and honey. Now, where I come from, we use peanut butter to mask the awful taste of psilocybin mushrooms. WHY would you forcefeed a poor helpless goose for ten years, only to bake its fatty liver and serve it to some asshole who can't stomach it, so masks it with peanut butter??! It's the ultimate insult!  If you are a member of the 1%, afflicted with chronic ennui and unable to stomach anything that hasn't been jellied/truffled/deconstructed into submission...  You will love this place!  Enjoy, you supercilious motherfucker!!!!!",

However, I think they're still working their kinks out and learning how to properly prepare the meats as well.   Jose Andres is such a great chef, that everything was great. Our only problem was that they kept trying to oversell us and cooked our steak wrong, never told us, but instead, just kept us waiting. and waiting and waiting. And Chateuabriand doesn't' take over an hour.   If you've never been to a Jose Andres restaurant, you'll love the Bazaar Meat. the quality is superb and actually the meats are excellently prepared as they cuts are so great. Just give them time to work out the opening kinks and the waiters enough time to understand the menu and the diners.   Must get is the cotton candy foie gras. like. MUST GET.",

The bar bill was likely right about $200............with that, i would assume that a NICE dinner for 5 (higher end) would run about $70-$80 per head (after all, how much can you eat)............wrong. My bill was $998.  We did not eat the finest meat, we had the mid range meat.  We did not order a whole pig, we ordered 1/4 pig and we did not order lobster for everyone.  We shared three vege side dishes and 2 potato side dishes........  the food was excellent, the ambiance was inviting, service was \"ok\"........but the pricing at the end of the day is more than i can stand to pay.  you will see if you look at my profile that i eat at some decent, pricey places and don't mind paying for such.........but at some point I have to ask about value for the dollar.   If you want a show and price is no object, you will enjoy JOse. If you just hit the lottery, or hit well at SLS Casino and looking to blow some money, Jose is the place.  for the average working man or even executive, it's just too pricey.",

    "text": "I told myself that I would never make the effort to write a review on my iPhone. I hate this keyboard and I feel like I won't review as well because of it. I am sacrificing these reasons because I did not want to deny anyone who is in Vegas looking for a steak house to miss out on Bazaar Meats. The thought of my not writing a review becoming the cause for someone to eat at a mediocre restaurant did not sit well with me.  As I lay here on this semi comfortable couch staring at my view of Las Vegas being embraced by the desert I cannot help but remember every bite of last night's meal. Simply put I had the best steak of my life and if that wasn't enough (and it easily could have been) the robouchon mashed potatoes were even better. So good that my disappointment in the spinach dish we got has been erased from my memory till that sentence. Sure the service was great and the cocktails were on point but that's what expect out of Vegas. The food up until last night has always just been ok till now.   2.25 pound rib eye for two was more than enough for the three of us eating. The mashed potatoes was clearly not enough. Not because the portion was tiny but we just wanted more. I personally have never potatoes this smooth or creamy in my life. The butter on it complimented it perfectly. Oh yeah and the streak was ridiculously great. Cooked to perfection with the perfect crust. We were warned that it was a 50 minute wait on the rib eyes but it was obviously well worth it.   Though it's not on the heart of the strip the travel to it is worth it if that's the debate you're having. I know that next time I come to Vegas every effort will be made to dine here again or at the least get a soda cup of the mashed potatoes to slurp on like a milkshake as I walk down Las Vegas boulevard dreaming of what Vegas has in store for me next.",

DON'T JUDGE ME  1) Make a reservation. 2) Cotton candy foie gras is possibly the best small bite ever created and if you don't like it, you're wrong. 3) The giant chicharron is, in fact, GIANT. It was tough to get through the portion we were given and my jaw hurt afterwards.  4) If you see and air bread sandwich item, order it, it's filled with cheese foam and it'll blow your mind.

Very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. He made our night memorable so request for him if you can.   We ordered a ton of food including vegetables. One of the people in our party was on a vegetarian diet for Chinese New Years so he couldn't eat meat. What a shame but the vegetable dishes were all excellent. Some dishes that stood out for me were the Cotton Candy Foie Gras, the A5 Kobe Eye of the Rib (comes with a certificate that you get to keep) and their Suckling Pig. My mouth is watering thinking about it. We started with a bottle of Veuve and ended with another bottle of Veuve. Amazing dinner and now one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.

    "text": "When i go to a fine dining restaurant, i expect nothing but perfection. Otherwise, what's the point of paying 800 USD for a meal of three, right?  So let me start this review by dissecting my experience at Bazaar Meats last night into critical components.  First of all the space - the restaurant is tucked away in the far corner of a rather deserted SLS hotel. The space is predictably large and when you walk in you are greeted by a lush smell of butter (which actually comes from grilling of aged meat on the open fire) and a not so lush hostess with a nose piercing.   As you turn right, you walk past the grilling station, laid out in grand square, with grills, josper ovens and a Spanish oven with colourful ornamental tiles. This part of kitchen is very exposed, so whoever works this station has to be really organised and skilled to be able to carry the pressure of cooking perfect food AND doing it in the most appealing way. I have to sadly admit that was not the case. It wasn't exactly a mess, but you would expect a fine dining kitchen to be in immaculate order. There were containers covered with plastic, scattered around, the sous chef running the grill was slabbing and trimming pieces of meat in a highly unappealing manner.   Now, I have to say that I do understand that the slabbing and trimming part could be part of the concept (bazaar, mercato, market), designed that way - I get that - but to my personal taste I would rather see the grilling not the butchery.   The staff was pleasant enough - we had a waitress with great attitude, who appeared to be a True believer of the dishes they serve in the restaurant and she was even able to tell us where they order the plates from. We have also asked to wrap the bone for us for the dog - weird and non-standard requests always reveal the real willingness of staff to create the best level of satisfaction possible.  Moving on to the food.  1. Romaine on ice. When the concept is that simple, the ingredients must be supreme. The salad leaves we've got were not wilted but the greener and more delicate ends were not as fresh and springy as they should have been. Romaine did not definitely created an impression of the one that was just picked up from the planter. Breakfast radishes were immaculately prepped. The ranch dressing was well balanced.  2. Bellota ham. Great quality, perfectly cured, highly marbled, rich red color. Good job on choosing the right supplier.  3. Suckling pig. This was pure heaven. PURE HEAVEN. Succulent meat, melting-in-the-mouth yet crispy skin, delicate balance of spices. The pig has to be pre-ordered, so make sure you reserve it in advance as they tend to run out of them very quickly. Very skilful cooking technique and, again, great choice of supplier (we've been told that the piglets are imported from Spain).  4. Washugyu from Oregon. The quality of meat was good (not great though). It was under seasoned and not trimmed properly.   5. Ice-cream experience. Comes with vanilla ice-cream and three glasses of vanilla, coffee beans and brandy. You are supposed to take a spoon of the ice-cream, sniff the vanilla and the beans and then take a sip of the brandy. This unnecessary extravaganza cannot distract from the fact that the ice-cream is very flat and mono-oriented in taste - it's too sugary and depressingly lacks vanilla flavour.   To sum it all up - the experience was mixed. The ham and the suckling pig were great, the rest of the dishes were quite average.",

My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here for our 3rd year anniversary 2 weeks ago, and our server, Tony, made the experience that much more worth it. If I ever dine here again, I would love for Tony to be our server. Tony was attentive, charismatic, personable... and just an overall great server to have small talks with in between meals. If anyone ever gets the chance to have Tony as their server, they are lucky! He's quite a foodie himself!  In addition to the great service, the food was delicious as well. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menu, and nothing disappointed us. Presentation of the dishes were all different and unexpected, which made us look forward to each dish that came to our table.  Overall...Ambiance was great. Food was great. Service was even better! Thank you Tony!",

The food-   a) Super-Giant Pork Skin Chicharron- The sauce was good but the the Chicharron itself did not have a lot of flavor.  I would recommend trying a different appetizer.  b) Vittore 1950- Pretty good.  c) I would like to review the steak I had but not I cannot remember which one it was.  Whichever one it was was tender and flavorful.   d) Suckling Pig- This was very good.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I'm usually more a steak fan but I liked this very much and would get it again.  ***There are many nice places to eat in Vegas and this one should be on your list.***",

This is the second time we had it and again was not a fan. Everything else though, I'm living for!!",

    "text": "With Bazaar Meat's future in doubt following Alex Meruelo's recent purchase of SLS, a proper meal there was an absolute must for me.  Saturated fat and cholesterol be damned, it was time to feast hard, which meant starting with meat, followed by more meat and then ending with meat.   Vegetarians should stop reading.  This got ugly quick.  The \"Classic\" steak tartare startartared the evening right with beef sirloin, Savora mustard, egg yolk, HP Sauce, and anchovy mixed tableside.  Perfectly chunky with a medium spicy kick, this went smashingly with the buttery, pillow-like Parker House rolls as kind of like sliders for high rollers.    We then went straight into the \"Chef's Selection of Cured Meats\" headlined by the fantastic \"Jamon Iberico de Bellota\" hand-cut from the famous black-footed acorn-fed, free-range, Spanish pig I've enjoyed a time or 12 at Jaleo at Cosmopolitan.  Other standouts were the mortadella, the interestingly textured, nutty wild boar sausage and the minimal chew required, melt in my freakin mouth Curemaster's Reserve Mangalitsa Ham.  We ordered additional bread to go with it and the \"Pa Amb Tomaquet\", Catalan-style toasted pan de cristal with fresh tomato rounded things out well.   Things escalated with \"Vaca Vieja\", a 6 oz ribeye originating from hand-selected eight-year-old working cows from Petaluma, CA (Mindful Meats).  The menu described the flavor as mature with a more pronounced flavor.  It was amusingly beefier and tenderly leaner than a standard ribeye.    That was a great prelude to the muthafuckin A5 Kobe \"Eye of the Rib\" from Hyogo Prefecture.  With only a handful of restaurants in LV certified to serve Kobe beef from actual Kobe, Japan unlike 99% of the pretenders out there, they take it pretty damn seriously with the official certificates and plaques proudly displayed at the entrance detailing process and care of the cow and how it's from the original strand of Kobe cow.    3 slices weighing in at 2 oz for $100?  Out.Fucking.Standing.  Having enjoyed Kagoshima A5 twice this year, what sets Kobe apart is the tenderness and better fat distribution.  The staff took it even further while cooking the beef tableside by bringing a bonsai tree to the table (are we supposed to imagine being in Japan?) and giving us fancy wooden chopsticks, which we stole.     Dinner could have ended for some people, but not when the beastly 2 lb \"Beef Rib Steak\" (Wagyu/Black Angus from Rollingwood, TX) arrived.  This medium-rare Spanish style bone-in ribeye was oak-wood fired for an unbelievable crust.  I love huge, thick steaks because each area is like a totally different story.  From the juicy, bloody center slices to the burnt, fatty edges with the short rib-esque medium-well pieces to the goddamn bone itself, which was fucking gold; this was gorgeous beef!  I rate it as one of the very best I've had in Las Vegas.       We knew not to pass on dessert due to Chef Jose Andres' Willy Wonka-ness and the staff was kind enough to bring out several remarkable treats on the house with the standout being the \"Carmelized Puff Pastry\" with bacon, strawberries and cream.     \"THE Vanilla Ice Cream Experience\", featuring an exceptionally velvety in-house made vanilla ice cream with 3 glasses (aged rum, coffee beans and aged vanilla bean) was so cool though!  The instructions were to sniff/breathe in one of the scents while the ice cream was still in your mouth.  Doing this completely changed the taste in a major way and maybe it was all the gin and tonics I had thrown down or the massive beef high I was on, but this was a highly entertaining way to end an incredible meal.  I hope they stick around in some form or another!",

Mix and match your choices and formulate your own experience.  This is where the fun is.   A simple example is the baked peppers and the octopus pulpo, great separate standalone dishes but combined - fohgetaboutit.  This is why Tapas was brought into existence.   The servers were trained well and very measured in their responses.  The hostess needs a little more for those who have no reservations - pardon the misplaced negativity without the minutiae.    Thank you Jose for the delightful cornucopia of Joy.   I will be back on Friday for the main event this time with reservations and a preordered dish - Bazaar's heart and soul.",

    "text": "I choose to come to Bazaar Meat after having a very memorable dining experience in Los Angeles at Bazaar. Located the rear of the SLS hotel, the restaurant is known for avant garde cuisine with a focus on meat and seafood.   With 5 separate kitchens/stations your meal is prepared by some of the best talent in Las Vegas. I would highly recommend either choosing one of the 3 tasting menus or asking the server for recommendations. Let the restaurant dictate your meal, vs choosing what you like or don't like (commonly misconceptions based on a bad meal).   Some of the highlights were the innovative cocktails. A must try is the margarita. Get your camera ready! I would loved the carpaccio with the warm cheese sauce, and the dessert.   The menu is well equipped to handle large parties who want to share a record size steak, those looking for something adventurous, or those with a smaller appetite.   For dessert they have mini desserts and bites. After a large meal of steak, a 1-2 bite dessert is the best way to cap off the meal. Great job!  What Bazaar Meat is not is a traditional steakhouse where you get a steak, potato, vegetable, and salad starter for $75. That's an old school idea. Try Bazaar Meat for something innovative, fun, and exciting that also is expertly prepared.",

The brainchild of chef Jose Andres, this restaurant is one of the best dining experience you can hope to have in Las Vegas.  The waiter described every nuance of their service to us. From the tasting menus to the way the Josper Grill tempers the meat and then cold it perfectly. We went ala carte so we could try exactly as much or as little as we wanted to. We never felt pressured or pushed in any direction by our sever Michael.  We started with a margarita and a glass of sangria. Perfect. We moved next to the homemade chicharrone and yogurt dipping sauce. Next was, wait for it, the cotton candy covered foie gras. Eat it in one bite. Its amazing. A half dozen of meaty British Columbia and Virginia oysters followed by the steak carpaccio on a crustini. We had a Caesar salad on stalks of endive. Then the big show arrived a Rosewood, Texas Ribeye cooked to perfect medium rare with the Robuchon potatoes on the side. butter butter butter and some potato. Dessert was the mini sampler of a pecan tartlet a flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse on top and a meringue cake. If you have the chance I implore you to visit Chris and his staff at the restaurant.  It is a dining extravaganza.",

That's how is supposed to be.   The patatas bravas were, honestly, average. Didn't enjoy them at all. But, the Secreto Iberico was very good, let me tell you that. My friend is vegetarian (I know!) so it's a no, no for her as vegetable plates were small and over priced.   We ended up paying about $140 plus tip which wouldn't actually be expensive if you don't count that she ate four mushrooms and five asparagus.   Other than that, meat lovers, enjoy.",

We started off with the shrimp and crab cocktail which was absolutely amazing until we both got a mouth full of shells and my husband got a tendon something you wouldn't be too upset over if it was $10 but @ this scale its totally unacceptable. We brought it to the servers attention and he took care of it he didn't seemed overly surprised about it though. Then we ordered a steak that was the one he said was most popular, lobster, the mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes were to die for the asparagus were really good but could have used a little more sauce due to how fat the asparagus were the steak was good too. Now let's get to this lobster OMG it was the absolute WORST thing ive ever ate in my life!  The only way i can describe it is it was like a baby diaper when it gets wet and the little gel beads get all swollen up it was seriously like eating that!! It didn't even taste anything like lobster (I always order lobster when we go out to fancy dinners) I couldn't believe it so i told my husband (who eats absolutely everything) to try it he said the same thing he wouldn't even touch it!  At this point I was embarrassed to say anything beings i work in this industry i didn't want them thinking we were \"those type of customers \" so i just ate the sides and my husbands steak. The server hadn't been back to check to see if everything was ok so he finally came & was talking to the table next to us about 15 minutes after we received our food then turned to our table like he was going to check on us looked right at the lobster and turned back around LOL i was like hmmm he must already know this is garbage.   So we sat about another 20 minutes before he came back and asked if we wanted boxes we said just for the steak and potatoes he said you didn't want to take the lobster? It was then when i told him it was awful he apologized and said he would take care of it. Then we got a dessert menu and orderd our desserts thinking maybe they would write happy anniversary on it or something to make it special..... nope! The host told us happy anniversary when we walked in and never heard another thing about it. Just was all and all a huge disappointment for our special night out alone. Don't think we will be returning ever again.",

As you are walked to your seat, meat is being grilled in an open kitchen right off the lobby. GIANT cuts of meat. Like the one on the side of the Flintstone's car. JK  After we sat, we were met by a waiter and a sommelier who were outstanding on explaining on how the menu worked. The waiter explained that the menu was tapas style. He also gave us three pre-fixed menu choices. One was ~$100, one was ~$175 and one was ~$275 a person. The cost was pretty outrageous.   We decided to not go off of the fixed menu and order a la cart. We had six men and decided to go with the following.  2 bottles of wine one bottle of sherry (over $500.00)  -Gazpacho shots -Croquetas de Pollo -Board of meats -Spanish tomato bread  3 lbs of the Vaca Vieja steak. ($65/lb) 1Catalan spiral sausage ($42/24 oz)  1 Veal Chop ($42/16oz) 1-Asparagus side- $15 1-Cauliflower side  $15 1-Brussel Sprout side $15  20 Assorted Desserts  The meal was way over $1200.00 with the wine and desserts. If you are looking to eat a lot this is not the place to go to fill your belly. This is the place to go if you want a party on your palate. Best meat I have had in years. But was hankering for a little bit more to eat after the meal was over.",

First off service was spectacular we had mentioned in our reservation we were celebrating our anniversary and we got welcomed with a greeting and congratulations and we got complimentary dessert and bubbles :) SLS is a little further down the strip but the restaurant is worth the drive. We got the Cotten candy foie Gras, Kobe airbread, lox, smoke and ice oysters, beefsteak tomato, veja vieja Spanish style steak, grilled lobster. All the small bites were perfect tasters size except the beef and parmasean grissini it came out with 5 gigantic breadsticks covered in the beef with a yummy Parmesan dipping sauce. so it's more filling than we thought, but super tasty a good dish to share with larger group. Beefsteak tomato is good for vegetarians and if you want a lighter veggie taste can ask for extra lettuce without the lettuce it's too much on the basaltic for my taste. Smoke and ice oysters beautiful presentation and smoky flavor is in the foam on top of the oyster. Glad we tried it but little too much foam. My favorite small bites were the Kobe airbread and cotton candy foie Gras. The hubbys was the lox and grissini. Veja vieja was sooo good would recommend that dish hands down. Grilled lobster was solid has smokey taste that makes it unique but down side out female lobster had the black eggs so it wasn't the most appetizing appearance but that could be just our personal preference. Wished we tried a different meat instead.   Magic mojito is such a fun drink they do the cocktail tableside and pour the drink over cotton candy! On the sweet side but so creative! Also got the Manhattan and that was excellent also smokey presentation tableside. Overall very pleased and completely full after the dinner. Allow yourself at least 2 hrs for the experience so you don't rush through it!",

To eat we got the cotton candy foie gras which was very different than anything I've ever tasted . It was good but nothing spectacular about it . Next we ordered the pork skin chicharron . I'm of Hispanic descent and I have to say, this is the best chicharron I've ever had . Flavor was spot on. Next we did the classic tartare which was good and seasoned right at the table. Next the beef and Parmesan griccini which was amazing ! And let me not forget the buttered mashed potato , best mashed potato I've ever had !",

As a DC resident, I'm blessed with so many of his restaurants (favorites being minibar, zaytinya, oyamel and not so favorites being jaleo and China Chilcano). I've also tried his bottomless brunch at the W Hotel in Mexico City -- out of the above, and perhaps actually out of all restaurants in general, Bazaar Meat will be one of my top restaurants.   Don't expect a rushed meal here! It's a culinary experience and every item from the drinks to the steaks to side dishes were all presented with flair and creativity!   Flavors were so memorable and service was impeccable. Very friendly wait staff, not pretentious and knowledge about the menu inside and out.   Highly recommend !!",

The flavor that they packed into every bite is mind blowing. From the crispy skin of the suckling pig that inexplicably was crunchy while still melting in your mouth to the flavor explosion that was the carpaccio, everything was stellar.  This meal was absolutely the highlight of our trip. Our waiter Matt and his assistant/food runner/don't know his official tile Eric made this beyond enjoyable. Thank you so much for an incredible night.",

The staff walked me through a couple great options to explore the menu and it was well worth it. Don't get me wrong, you should be ready to spend a little cash here, not cheap but well worth it IMO. I'll be back for sure, hopefully, with a large group, there was so much more on the menu I wanted to try. One thing that was cool is I was able to get 1oz of each of the A5 grade cuts. Most places have 3-5 oz minimum per, but given the richness of these meats eating 5 OZ of A5 Kobe would have left me feeling sick, additionally would have limited me to what else I was able to order. If you like meat, if you like wine, if you like a great dining experience, despite the mediocrity of the hotel itself, go to Bazaar and live it up, at least once.",

    "text": "A family friend recommended we try Bazaar Meat while in Vegas, and that friend also made a reservation for us as they knew someone that worked there.  That said, getting a reservation on your own is not difficult, but I would recommend a reservation.  When my wife and I arrived at the SLS hotel/casino, it was extremely quiet.   However, when we got to the restaurant, it was quite busy.  I am afraid Bazaar Meat is the only thing that was drawing people to the property.    We started with a couple of pre-dinner cocktails.  Then we ordered a recommended bottle of red.  Don't recall exactly what it was, but there was a good selection of wines.  Obviously for a place specializing in red meat we went with something on the big and bold end of the spectrum.    We then ordered a couple of apps.  We got the pork grinds and the cotton candy foie gras. Both were...unique to say the least.  I can't honestly say I would get them again, but nothing wrong with them.  Just a matter of personal taste.  For our main we split a steak and the buttery mashed potatoes.  The waiter made sure we were aware that the steak would not be like a normal American steak, and that it might seem tougher, but assured us it would be more flavorful.  He was right.  Only slightly less tender than a premium steak at a normal US style steak house, but definitely a more flavorful experience.  The potatoes were amazing.  Service throughout the meal was absolutely top notch.  They checked on us regularly, and made great recommendations.    This was not an inexpensive meal.  It is not supposed to be.  Total was $325 before tip.  Keep in mind we had cocktails and a bottle of wine.  So pretty standard price for a 5 Star restaurant on the Strip.",

Service is excellent, and the space grows on you even though it lacks intimacy and has terrible noise control.

We had a fairly simple dinner of Rib Eye steak, potatoes and asparagus, with a great bottle of Chateau Neuf du Pape. The flavors were incredible. Next time we will try the tasting menus to get a better sense of what the kitchen is capable of.   Overall a great experience for foodies.",

But if it's a reason to celebrate or you just feel like blowing some hard earned dough on some amazing steak then this is a good place to do it.  The decor is a bit odd, an odd melange of hunting lodge, mardi gras, and up scale steakhouse - but whatever, that's not what you are there for and most importantly the seating is super comfortable and spaced out so you are not on top of other people.  Couple Mezcal negronis to start ($16 a piece) were excellent - simple drink but for some reason quality can vary.  As for food, got a dozen oysters which were great but for $48 not sure the value is so great.  For the main event, got the 'rosewood' which was a 2 lb wagyu rib-eye from Texas and my god is was incredible (I drooled on keyboard typing this....) - for a high end steak of this quality, $200 is totally reasonable.  For the side, got roasted leeks and they really squeezed out all the flavor and texture for what I can consider and otherwise bland vegetable.  All of this goodness was pared with the 2004 Tondonia, recommended by the verbose, yet friendly sommelier.  I look forward to coming back for sure, but for +$500 for 2 people I'll need to check the wallet before doing so...",

The girls at the reception were so great! The manager, Roberto, exceded expectations. He genuinely cares about his diner's experience. He gave me a beautiful table with a great view of the open fire cooking, and helped modify the menu for my food allergies. I had their signature cotton candy foie gras, which melted in my mouth! I also had the real Kobe, which was heavenly and came with its own little bonsai tree. The cauliflower steak was divine.

I so so so wanted to like this place but unfortunately the steak we had was beyond disappointing, one of the worst steak experiences I'd ever had.  It wasn't all bad, rewind a little to the beginning. The ambience of this restaurant is quirky and unexpected, in a good way.  I imagined we were sitting in the parlor of a wealthy retired oil tycoon whose hobby was hunting game. When you walk up the restaurant you are immediately hit with the smell of what I anticipated would be the best meat eating experience of my life. The smell!!! It smelled soooo delicious! The meat is out in cases. Some of the largest slabs, thickest cuts of steak I'd ever seen. Definitely a unique Vegas experience.  The service was phenomenal. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and guided us through top items to order. The GIANT CHICHARRON=AMAZING! If you like pork, that's a must.  We were skeptical about the COTTON CANDY FOIE GRAS. But it too was AMAZING! The REUBEN=AMAZING! We ordered the side of BUTTERED POTATOES=AMAZING! All these pieces leading up the star of the show, the VACA VIEJA. To my dismay it was the toughest piece of meat I'd ever eaten. You can really never go wrong with ribeye, or so I thought. Considering how much the the meat was hyped up, I started to doubt myself. \"Maybe that's was steak is supposed to be like, and I just have been doing it wrong my whole life? I mean the taste is there, but shouldn't it melt like butter when you cut it? Maybe they gave us the wrong steak? Maybe the kitchen is having a bad day. Etc.\" Unfortunately, we had to catch a show right after dinner, and didn't have time to send it back.   I always debate whether or not I should go back, and give it another shot. But when you spend hundreds of dollars on a meal that is memorable in a bad way, it's tough to justify trying it again. Ugh! I so so wanted to like this places. Even with all the positives the star of the show left a bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "Definitely an amazing steak house. While prices are a little high, meat is amazing. I would not recommend going all fancy for the A5s that go by the ounce. I did not think they were amazing and worth the price difference. However, their sizzling pig is amazing and the big guy steak portions as well. Steaks are perfectly cooked. Sides are yummy too. Servers give you the 5* experience - very attentive and knowledgeable. Also, their drink menu is good. I had a cotton candy mojito that had quite a presentation (they bring the drink with cotton candy in the glass and while they pour the drink mix you see the cotton candy disappear in your glass). Also, for dessert we had the 10 piece-combo which was perfect for 4 people and very interesting and tasty. It was great as it had a lot of different types of dessert in very small portions (one bite kind of thing). It was my second time here - I definitely enjoyed myself more this time. The first time I went was for restaurant week and I felt like the entire thing was a rip off. I would not recommend going there for that as you will just spent a lot of money ($80 was the tasting menu per person + drinks, tax, tip) and you definitely do not get the experience as the menu is poorly designed. I would have given 2-3 stars after my first experience, however, I am happy we returned for the full experience. Yesterday's meal was 5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "Service - Great (Eric was very friendly and eager to help).  Setting - Nice interior, still have to walk through a typical Vegas casino in the SLS hotel to get there.  Food - A5 Wagyu tenderloin, Jamon Iberico de Bellota, a shot of gazpacho, two cocktails, setas (mushrooms), two bite size tarts and small eclair for dessert. We both felt the wagyu tenderloin was the best meat we had ever tasted.   Price - Not worth the amount of food. Not even close. The amount of wagyu that came out could have fit in my hand. The jamon was sliced unbelievably thin and amounted to about 4 ounces. The total for everything was over $500.  Overall, the experience straddled the fence between decadent and pretentious but I feel it eventually fell to the pretentious side. We left happy for the experience of rare food, but still hungry and over $500 poorer.  I would recommend NOT eating here unless you really don't care about the money.",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've blown a good amount on dining and actually left really satisfied, but Mr Andres has managed to hit both targets for me. The service was outstanding. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy. I think you could walk in easily on a Friday night, but it's better to play it safe with a reservation.  Items I can do without next time: The Bagels & Lox Cone doesn't do anything for me. I've never been a fan of salmon roe. The Chicharron was pretty interesting and a nice way to munch on something while waiting for your food.   On the cusp: The Rib Eye and Tenderloin were fantastic. Probably the best renditions I've ever had, although I'm not much of a steak guy. All my friends were gushing over them. It's the kind of meat that makes everyone at the table go silent on first bite.  I must have again: Croquetas de pollo - it's basically the best croquette you'd ever have in your many lifetimes.  Beef & Parmesan Grissini - Meat on a cracker stick! Yes! I'd 10 of these in one sitting and be quite happy.  In the end, I ate too much food and suffered massive food coma. So this is not a place you want to go to right before hitting a club or bar for some drinks if you eat like I do. Everything was great and I definitely want to try other things on their menu if there's ever a next time.",

Chloe, the sommelier, was amazing as well. I just told her what types of red wines I liked and she brought out perfectly paired wines. I would definitely recommend the cotton candy foie gras, it melts in your mouth. The suckling pig is to die for as well. The bison carpaccio had a unique flavor. I'm pretty sure they're menu also changes seasonally which I love, so next time I'm in town there will be new foods to try. This restaurant is worth checking out, I would be surprised if you were disappointed.",

By far Ashley is the best bartender. Always friendly & striking up a conversation & can actually hold a conversation unlike some of them.

Even tho it was still good, it was a little under seasoned for my taste, I couldn't help but to ask if they had any steak sauce. They did, but I didn't care for the steak sauce either.   Probably wouldn't come back by choice simply because the taste was not a wow factor according to the price. To me at least.

    "text": "I like to try a good steakhouse whenever I visit Las Vegas, and Bazaar Meat did not disappoint.  I have this idea of what a perfect steak should taste like, but it always seems to elude me, aside from very few steakhouses I've visited.  This was one of them.  We started with the gazpacho shot and foie gras cotton candy.  (I came back the next evening for a cocktail and another cotton candy, it was so good.)  For dinner, I ordered the 8-oz dry-aged flatiron, which was one of the specials that day, and we also tried the 2-lb bone-in wagyu ribeye.  Both were ordered medium rare.  The flatiron was very concentrated in that perfectly dry-aged funky way, and served with a rich, creamy sauce.  The ribeye was also delicious, but a very different experience.  The marbling made it really well balanced, though more subtle in flavor than the flatiron.  Both steaks were seasoned perfectly, with flaked sea salt, which added texture.  We had the confit piquillo peppers and delmonico potatoes on the side.  I loved the sides, especially the peppers, but next time around I would order lighter sides since the meat is already so flavorful and rich.  The restaurant had also sent over a complimentary appetizer of croquettes and chicharrones, both really fun in presentation and flavors.  Our server was also very patient with all our questions, and checked on us frequently.  All the staff was well trained and hospitable, which I appreciated.  I haven't had too much desire to go back to some of the other steakhouses I've been to, not because they weren't great, but because there are so many other places to try; however, I would likely go back to Bazaar Meat.",

I understand it must be difficult to figure out how to climatize a huge room with the kitchen in the middle, but it was seriously cold away from the kitchen. Unfortunately, the pompous waiter thought serving people (that have never been to an over-priced tapas restaurant) was below him.  He was disgusted that we didn't understand how the 5 of us (practically strangers - business associates) were supposed to pass around a bone with meat on it to share.   Regardless of my opinion of sharing meat on a bone around the table, the service was horrible. The waiter (that was appalled at our indecisive ordering) forgot ALL the vegetables and potatoes we ordered! When we asked for them, he obviously found them somewhere and served them cold, just like the $300+ of not-close-to-warm meat served.  If your wallet needs to be thinned out on lukewarm food, this is the place for you.",

We had a party of six and only waited for a short time. We had one of their unique cocktails while we waited. I should have took pictures, but I was too busy enjoying all of the smells, tastes and taking in the decor. Ummm alligator heads on the walls. Yassss!   Once seated we reviewed the menu. It was a tad confusing for some of our party, but basically it's family style. It's meant to be shared. What we had: *Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron:Greek yogurt, za'atar spices, I found this a little bland. I would say take a pass.  *Croquetas de Jamon: Creamy bechamel filling with jamon de bellota, now these were delicious! Absolutely melted in our mouth, like an explosion of goodness.  *Gazpacho Shots: Tomato, cucumber, green bell peppers, I would rate these just ok. I would pass on these next time. My hubby liked it a lot though.  *Vittore 1950*: Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing, ok this was brave for me (it's raw), but I liked it. Would do it again.  *Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus, scrumptious!!!!! I don't know what else to say, melted in your mouth.  *Grilled Asparagus, it was asparagus.  *Robuchon potatoes:Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes, the most creamy, guilty, rich, beautiful mashed potatoes I have ever put in my mouth. Dreamy lol.   Ok the take away. I would eat here again. I enjoyed it immensely. However. It is expensive. So if you are going as a group make sure everyone understands that. Also, the meat is priced PER POUND. So the ribeye isn't 75, it's 75 PER POUND with most rib eyes averaging 2 lbs. We didn't notice that and ordered two for our group. My hubby and I still thought for the diversity of the menu, taste and enjoyment of the food, as well as the wonderful service, it made it well worth the price. We will see you again.... next time reserving a suckling pig. Yum.",

    "text": "WOW, I went on a Friday night 11/21/14 and this ranks in my top 5 of all time.  Everything was Perfect!  Atmosphere, presentation, food, and SERVICE!  I like to look for the best of the best and although other reviews read differently, the night we went was one of the best nights out I have had out.   I went with 6 of my  friends on a guys weekend. I will say this is a meat lovers restaurant, if you're not into the fancy, the presentation or the expensive this is not your place. But if you look for the finest then check this place out.  With one bottle of wine we were at $250 a head.    My only complaint and not worth dinging them a star is their wine menu.  It was nice, but was over the top, over priced.  I have many of the bottles they offered in my cellar and I know I what they cost. Double or sometime Triple on high-end mark up is common, but I say 5x prices on some bottles.  I had to choose the cheapest at $160 so I could savor the meal, if I came back I'd bring my own bottle and pay the corkage.   Presentation was great, portions were nice, uniqueness was great.  Highly recommend.",

The service was unparalleled. It seems as though any member of staff will do their personal best to guarantee you are satisfied but Tony was exceptional! The menu is made up of classic steakhouse offerings but each plate has a twist keeping it fresh, exciting, and seriously delicious! The drinks were presented to you table side with innovate techniques that made you want to order more.. definitely returning! Huge thanks to Bazaar for making a special night unforgettable!",

    "text": "I dined at Jaleo, a restaurant by Jose Andres and loved it! So when my friend told me about his newest restaurant, Bazaar Meat, at the SLS hotel...I had to say OH MEAT! Since Bazaar Meat is located at the newly built SLS hotel...it is kind of \"far\". No offense, but it was kind of dead in the hotel and the restaurant when my friends and I were there on a Friday night. Despite that, the food was still delicious! The girls and I each ordered their gin & tonic, which was Spanish style with big chunk of ice and some floral decor. They used Fever Tree tonic, which I love love love! However, they did not mention what kind of gin they used...hmmm.   The chef started us with a complimentary endive salad. The salad was covered with shredded cheese, so it was quite delicious...reminded me of a Caesar Salad but all in an endive. I had the Beef & Parmesan Grissini, which was sliced Washugyu beef carpaccio wrapped in pretzel sticks with an onion dipping sauce--this was so, so good! The place is known for the suckling pigs, which I recommend. If you were to order a whole one, call ahead of time! Otherwise, you can get them in quarters. Jose Andres' suckling pig was different from the Chinese one. The skin of this one is thinner and not as dry. The exterior was crispy and juicy, and the interior was crispy and juicy as well. It was served with a side of salad. We also tried the octopus. That was quite disappointing because it was dry, chewy and overly charred. To end the night, the serve made at our table an alcoholic grapefruit sorbet with liquid nitrogen. That thing was strong! All in all, the way they serve food here is pretty tapas-style with great presentations. The brussel sprout side was just okay. It was nothing like I expected--it's like boiled leaves.   Don't forget to save room for their dessert. It's like a small bites with big flavors--I recommend the hazelnut one! Overall, it was a great dining place.",

Great evening all the way through. Not close to the strip (former Sahara? there is a monorail from MGM), but beautiful and whimsical atmosphere. We have brought a mixed crowd, including a preteen and a teen, as well as business associates. Some guests were late, but the restaurant did not rush us at all. All guests, both experienced foodies and not, loved it. Got a great table, and an excellent an knowledgeable server. He took time to make a separate presentation to those guests who were late and one for the pre-teen girl who was overwhelmed with unknown food choices (she loved the food after all). Take your time and hear all about the chef and the inspiration and the story behind the dishes. We had a slow tapas start (timing was perfect with each dish, giving us a chance to share, enjoy and discuss). The meat sharing idea is brilliant (got a couple of different steaks, chicken, etc.) to share. Presentation and quality outstanding. Throughout the night, never felt pressured. In fact, when we asked if we should order more entrees, the server advised that we had a great selection and that we would be fine. He was right. Absolute must to do in Las Vegas, not cheap but worth every penny for a truly special meal. Will definitely go back, think this will fit for any occasion, from a romantic meal to a business dinner. Perfect.",

In a fake and pretentious city that wows you with smoke and mirrors, this massive and utterly eclectic undertaking is truly an experience in fine dining - yet approachable and above all FANTASTIC SERVICE!  Oscar made our evening light and delicious!  Abel, his busboy side kick, was just as knowledgeable and didn't miss a beat.  Each dish that hit the table was served by an enthusiastic server - a preamble for a delicious surprise. And as much as we wanted steak or the suckling pig, we opted to go \"tapas\" because we just couldn't pick!!!  And the vegetables are as good as the proteins!  And beautiful to boot!  Beautiful food.  Served with enthusiasm and utmost professionalism.  AWESOME!  Great Spanish wine list, fine crafted drinks, Bazaar offers value - the croquettas de pollo were so crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside, you just have to wonder how they can pull this off without the messy sticky fingers in croquettas making process - they come to you whimsically presented in a glass sneaker!  They are perfectly shaped, crisp and not greasy, light and flavorful.  You have to try the cotton candy foie gras!  ITS CRAZY!  One bite that hits all your senses.  And even though your brain tells you \"this doesn't make sense\", your mouth just says WOW!  Loved the presentation for the caviar flight!  These came accompanied by puffy french fries.  Fun to eat, you get to play with your food - the colors, the textures and the flavors!  The \"traditional tartare\" is so cool!  Ever had tableside guac?  Well they make you tableside tartare!  Premium meat that is both super tender, melt-in-your-mouth, but the make it to your liking while you watch!  They serve it with these dainty little buns that are made with beef rendering... BEST SLOPPY JOE EVER!  Another one of those fun dishes that is robust yet delicate, and so \"calm the carnivore\" oriented!  We also shared the gorgeous, delicately charred and flavorful cauliflower and leeks.  The last star before we called it quits was the melt-in-your-mouth sous vide beef cheeks in a sublime pepper sauce.  FABULOUS!!! 5 kitchens, all running at once, working hard to make you happy and crave their food!  Thank the cooks when you go by, for a job well done, and a meal so well enjoyed!  In a city full of fake boobs, fake teeth, fake hair, fake tans... its delightful to see a high end experience, staying real.",

My friend and I ordered anything that involved foie gras off the menu and was not disappointed.   Although the cotton candy and s'mores foie gras bought tears to my eyes, the foie gras soup warmed my heart and my soul that night. Honestly, I didn't think foie gras in soup form could be life changing but it was. I can be cliche and say it was a \"spiritual experience\" to drive the point home. Dramatic, no? I don't mess around when it comes to foie gras.  The meat, the pork, the chicken were all amazing as well.  Make sure to come here with people who appreciate good food because otherwise, its wasted on someone who thinks McNuggets is food of the gods.",

EXCEPT for the big meat dishes, which really required 4 people to eat if you also want to try the smaller plates, which are EXCELLENT. Some favorite small dishes include the epic foie gras cotton candy, and the foiefelle. The Waygu on a bread stick with espuma was also amazing, and the chicken croquettes are always tasty, but you can also get them at Jaleo. It's really missing the Philly Cheesesteak from the Beverly Hills locations to really make it the epic Bazaar location. The large meats are really big, like 2.5 to 3 lbs each. They have a roasted pig and 3 types of beef as the main large portions of meat options, including two Waygu options from the US. The large meats take 40-50 minutes to prepare, so you eat the tapas while you wait.  If you're a fan of Jose Andres, GO ASAP!",

There is always someone filling up your drink, cleaning your table, etc. We did the tasting menu for $185/pp. With cocktails, it's most expensive dinner we've had. We tried and liked the items that we wouldn't normally order (eg Cotton Candy Foie Gras). The steak is unforgettable. Now, I want to go to The Bazaar in Los Angeles!",

The dishes weren't as amazing in taste and creative in presentation like at the Bazaar. We had a huge effin steak that dare I say was slightly over-cooked - cardinal sin!!! The cracklins were cool to smash with the mallet but not particularly awesome. Most outstanding dish was a red pepper dish of all things. $$$$ prices but not $$$$ food like I'm used to from Jose Andres. Wouldn't say I had a bad meal, I just didn't have a typical, mind-blowing Jose Andres meal. I wouldn't go back here again since there's so many other bomb-ass places to heifer out in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is one of those places where you wish Yelp would allow six stars.  It has moved into my top five meals of all time.  Drinks - creativity off the chart.  Sea mist foam on top of the margarita - amazing.  Dissolving cotton candy on the mojito - crazy.  The lemon cocktail that is more like a sorbet made with liquid nitrogen - outstanding.  Wine list offers wide selection (though not a large selection under $100/bottle).  Food - there is a lot of pomp and circumstance about the preparations but underneath the taste and cooking itself were excellent.  Get the tasting menu, but sub out to get the cotton candy covered foie gras if it is not included.  It's only a single bite but well worth it.  We got the chateaubriand which was tender, cooked perfectly and very flavorful but I suspect any of the meats would have been great.  As for sides, every one we had seemed better than the last but trust the Yelp reviewers and don't miss the mashed potatoes.  Easily the best I have ever had.  Service - overall very good.  We set the pace of the meal by asking waitress to let us linger through cocktails, and then she checked back with us on when we were ready to start appetizers and again before the main course was ordered.  The bus staff was on point clearing and refilling plates / water, but one time they removed cocktails that were not yet finished.  We told the waitress and we got another drink on the house.  Only other item was that I prefer to have them decant my wine at the table but they went off and did it out of my sight.    Bazaar Meats location is a bit out of the way at the SLS but it is definitely worth the trip.",

The price point is on par with what is delivered.  Jose Andres is known for innovative ways to present and he delivers.  The ambiance is youthful and trendy, but believe me.. plenty of tourists (including myself)-so nothing to feel intimidated about.  I would definitely recommend. If you want another Jose Andres taste without the price point, check out his burger at Umami Burger.  (**not sure if its still there?- but if so- also a must try)",

(We usually stay at the W if we can or something comparable) I grew up in Las Vegas and worked on the strip for a few years, but I live in Los Angeles now. I had forgotten how customer service here just blows every other place away. This was no exception. We came for dinner, my husband likes his steak very very rare. About  80% of the time it's over cooked so he has to make it a point to ask the server to speak to the chef and make sure he knows that it should be almost like seared sushi. He usually says \"tan and blue\" not black and blue. We ordered a steak and it was over cooked, but we were going to eat it. We didn't want to make a big deal and it was still a very good steak. Our server (Joe) was persistent, he saw that it wasn't what we asked for so he said \"Please, LET me get you another one.\" So he brought out a new one and it was more cooked than the last one. This is a common problem for us, the chefs never really believe that someone wants a steak that rare. By this time we had had a few appetizers, drinks, and shared the first steak, he was full and happy so there really was no problem. Then the manager came over and apologized, and offered us dessert. The dessert here is out of this world AMAZING. These people really go above and beyond to make sure you have a 5 star experience and the food is world class. I can not say enough good things about this place.",

    "text": "Hands down the best meal I have ever had.  The steak tartare is a must-try, hand-mixed to your discerning taste at your table.  The can't-miss item is also likely the most bizarre one, Tortilla Sacromonte.  It's a sweetbreads, kidney, and bone marrow omelette, and the synergistic symphony of so many unique flavors and textures will make you wonder why all food can't be so exciting.  On the drink side, try the lemon shot (I forget what it's called).  The bartender comes out with a cart and synthesizes it there for you.  I say synthesize because, with the liquid nitrogen and its semi-frozen finale, it's really more of a chemistry experiment than a simple mixing of a drink.  On top of that, it's delicious.  As for the main course, if you haven't already taken your fill with the first side of the menu, you'll have a hard time finding anything you've found at any other restaurant.  Every meat item is listed with its place of origin, its age, and of course, what its diet was.  Have fun deciding on one!",

    "text": "...continued Going so far as to source the Bread for their Pa Amb Tomaquet straight from Spain for the sake of authenticity, the rest of the Breads and Pastries made on-site, those looking for another tasty raw bite should consider the Hot Sauce glazed Bison Carpaccio that pairs brilliantly with Chef's Paprika dusted Potato-sticks, these two snacks offered as a conclusion to a bakers-dozen 'appetizers' before two more Cocktails were presented, the Pepino Sonado smooth and refreshing with a great mouthfeel while the sweet and juicy Sangria Roja expectedly paired well with the grilled Meats to come.  Not expecting whole-plates, the point being to see as much variety as possible from a menu that is broad but at the same time focused, it was nonetheless that several large cuts were presented in a grand display of entrees and sides, the Turbot and Octopus straight from Spanish waters to the Josper Grill both impeccably charred and tender with the Fish still out-ranking any other in Sin City and a close rival to the famous version of Elkano while the Pulpo was a classic preparation served atop boiled Potatoes dusted with Paprika.   Deferring temperature to the kitchen, both the New Zealand Lamb Rack and Texas-based hybrid Cattle cooked Rare at low temperatures on the top rack of the grill, those who enjoy actually tasting the Animal as opposed to a bunch of Salt and seasoning will be duly impressed by the quality of either cut, Chef Pitts housemade Catalan Sausage also a remarkable dish that is currently available in a much smaller portion size than prior thanks to the Summer tasting menu.  Never one to refuse Joel Robuchon's classic 50/50 Butter and Potato Puree, Andres again paying homage to a contemporary by name on his menu, additional sides included roasted Mushroom Caps filled with Garlic, Butter and bitter Nasturtium as well as spicy little ears of Corn with 'powdered' Popcorn, the Foie Gras 'S'mores' an excellent way to bridge savory to sweet, as was the first of two double Espressos on Ice and a stiff and smoky Cocktail constructed tableside entitled \"Blurred Borders.\"  Previously underwhelmed by Bazaar's Pastry department, the idea of a bunch of petit fours sold sight-unseen at $2-8 seeming a bit disingenuous and unimaginative, recent times have seen the Restaurant usher in an immense Dessert Cart laden with over two-dozen choices, a 'one of each, please' strategy seeing two slates laid out with several clever creations, the Caramelized Pastry crediting Pierre Herme as well as the ones with Brandied Cherries or Bacon and Strawberries all quite memorable as were the Pecan Pie Cookie, Dark Chocolate Almond Eclair, White Chocolate Raspberry Chambord Cake and Tarts of Pineapple and Jasmine as well as Dulcey Pecan and Key Lime.  *****Although Jose Andres seems to make the news more often these days as an outspoken advocate for political causes than he does as a Chef, 2017 finds Bazaar Meat amongst not only the upper echelon of Las Vegas Steakhouses but Restaurants in general, Chef Pitts and GM Argyriades running a tight ship even as the rest of the SLS stands in limbo with the sort of ingredients, cooking and diversity that sees one already planning a return visit mere moments after they've left.",

Our first interaction with the waiter was so and so - he is one of those guys with an attitude when you ask clarification questions like he expects you to know the menu by heart. But looking at other reviews we asked if while the appetizers are cooked we can get a quick tour of the place. One of the assistant managers came in and gave us an amazing tour. Then during the meals he stopped by a few times with great stories about the place. He was amazing. A great presenter makes all the difference in a restaurant like this.  Regarding the food now: the ham croquettes are simply amazing. We tried both the chicken and the ham croquettes. The ham are definitely a superior choice. Very cheesy and gluey with a crispy exterior. The baked peppers were really good too. One of the unexpectedly delicious items on the menu is the prosciutto with tomato bread (bread is always imported directly from Spain, not made locally).  This is a must try. It is a very airy and breezy appetizer of exceptional quality. We also tried the grilled oysters (not amazing, even for the strip). And their appetizer potatoes cut like polenta slices, crispy exterior, with a tomato sauce on top. Pretty decent!  Kobe beef - extraordinary. We also had a bone in steak - also great.  All items were cooked to perfection. But I must warn you - the bill is not for the faint of heart ($620 for two people).",

They touted the cooking process that would allow the marbling in the steak to permeate and melt giving the steak a lovely rich moist dance flavor none of that happened I would like to think it was just a bad piece of meat, but we made mention to the server to no avail so I'm not sure. I definitely would not recommend being here unless you're in the mood for spinach.",

The steaks were juicy and cooked perfectly to order. The best mashed potatoes ever possible, so rich and decadent.

Plenty of people have written up the menu, but particular items of note were:  - All of the cocktails were top notch in taste and presentation, but particularly recommend the Aladdin Manhattan - The first caviar flight was delicious, and comes out on a custom-designed glass cascade that was pretty incredible. - Get the classic beef tartare - it's prepared table-side. Goes well with the Iberico Jamon, which I think comes from unicorn meat. - The A5 Wagyu Ribeye almost caused me to weep with joy - The suckling pig was a really cool experience and we all loved it, but I personally liked the steak even better - The butter mashed potatoes are even better than advertised. The asparagus was perfectly cooked but not special, and the cauliflower steak was fairly bland.  Our waiter handled our group wonderfully and really added to the experience. The only blip in the service was our entrees. We got the suckling pig first and then no sides or steak for 10 minutes, and when we asked the waiter and expo, they both said it was about to be brought out, but wasn't. We later learned that this is by design to enjoy things in the order that the chef wants. I am game for that sort of thing, but in this case one member of our party didn't eat pork and so he had nothing to eat for ten minutes. Had the staff explained this to us, we could have cleared it up but it came across like the food was just poorly plated.  After dinner, the GM, Pano Argyriades, gave us a great tour of the whole restaurant and we got to learn a lot about how they run the restaurant.   I highly recommend Bazaar Meat to anyone in town!",

They do add a 20% service charge and gratuity on top of that for large groups(7 I guess is large?) so be prepared for that.  But everything was great and a foodies paradise.",

    "text": "Short version... I would never go back. There are way too many great restaurants in Vegas to go to this one. Don't waste your $$ here.   I have been to many Steakhouses from California to New York. I've been to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak, Mario Batali's Carnevino, SW Steakhouse, Chops, Flemings, Chart House, Ruth Chris, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's and many more... my point is... never in my life did I order a steak thinking I was getting 16 oz but it wasn't until when my bill came that I learn my steak was actually 2.25 lbs. We asked the waiter about it, and he was like, \"oh yah, we gave you the smallest cut we had and it was 2.25 lb. I thought I had mentioned it.\" Um no... We wouldn't have ordered it if we had known. Had we known, we would have reduced the number of appetizers we ordered because we were so full, we didn't even touch much of the steak; the $168 piece of meat. (and you can judge for yourself from the picture... lots of fat!)  I know there are a lot of people like us whom are not rich but when in Vegas or on vacation, will splurge one time on a good meal. Every trip I take, I leave room in my budget to splurge on one good restaurant and I have always left feeling, hmmm, I'm glad I tried that. This place left a bad taste in my mouth.  I ordered based on reviews on Yelp, which has never disappointed but this time, I'm really disappointed. Maybe I went with too high of an expectation or maybe if I had order other things, I would have enjoyed it more. I will never know because I will never go back.  If you do go, don't waste your money on these:  Bagels & Lox ($6/bite size): it was no different than going to a sushi restaurant and ordering a flying fish roe.   Cotton candy foie ($8/bite size): it looks pretty but what a waste of a piece of foie gras  Chicharron ($12 huge portion): crispy pork skin... that's all it was. (One of my favorite restaurants in Sacramento is The Kitchen, they make every daily food item taste amazing. One time they served kettle corn popcorn and it was the most amazing kettle corn I've ever tasted. I thought it would be the same with the chicharron but it wasn't. It tasted like the street one I ordered in Mexico for $1).  Smoke and Ice Fresh Oysters ($24 6 pieces): I can go to my local farmers market and buy some oysters for $0.40/piece, shuck it, eat it and it would have tasted the same.  The classic beef tartar ($32 good portion): it was just a ... tartar. People on Yelp said it was the best tartar that they have tasted... I've had much better!   Morcilla Uni ($25 5 pieces): I love uni, but uni with blood sausage, this was disgusting; I couldn't even finish it. The uni didn't look fresh.   Robuchon (butter potatoes) ($19): they weren't kidding about their description: butter, butter, butter, and some potatoes... this was disgusting... if you like eating butter... then you will love this dish.   What was good: Beef Cheeks ($38): super tender and flavorable Boar sausage ($23): it was good    I guess I'm just used to going to these restaurants and eating something that I would want to go back for; something that sets them aside from other restaurants.  Everything I ate was not bad but I feel like I could have gotten the same thing somewhere else and for cheaper.",

    "text": "The review for this place is totally overrated.  One star for food, one star for services.  1) One of our friend ordered soup which came in a small drinking glass. She asked for a spoon and the waiter answered in a condescending tone as if he couldn't believe anyone would ask such question, \"you don't need a spoon, you drink it\" and walked away.  2) The Kobe Beef Airbread was filled with a lot of cream cheese, which coated the taste of Kobe beef. All we could taste was bread and cheese, especially when the Kobe beef was very thinly sliced.  3) The Wagyu Beef Cheek was just meh. It was chewy and tasted bland. Comparable to an overcooked roasted beef. I was looking forward to this dish but it was a total disappointment.  4) our main steak plate was bland. The meat is dry and way too chewy (I like chewy meat), the only good part is the medium rare partially cooked in the very middle, which was tender and melting in your mouth.  5) All of the sauces that came with the dishes we ordered were completely off. It's like you put avocado into a pickled jar.  I'm a steak lover and generally not very picky with my steak, but for such rating and prices, this is the most disappointing steak place I've ever tried.  Definitely not recommended nor coming back.  One pro is they do have a very nice displayed of their meat and grills.",

    "text": "I do not recommend Bazaar Meat in the SLS Hotel! It's posing as fine dining but it's not! And it's over priced. My husband and I were looking for a great surf and turf experience, but both the surf and the turf were terrible. My husband asked the waiter to recommend a good steak that would pair nicely with his lobster. What the waiter recommended amounted to 4 thinly sliced pieces of steak about the size of 4 thin slices of spam! They grilled it at the table and requested he eat it fast because it's not good if it sits for a while. They didn't sell just lobster tails. You had to buy the whole lobster. When his whole lobster arrived at the table the only truly edible part was the tail! The rest of the lobster had that disgusting green substance throughout, and it cost $90!  I ordered king crab legs. The crab legs were tasty, and they cut the legs in the shell nicely, but they only gave me one large leg and a few small pieces. Their mashed potatoes were so well whipped the consistency was that of cake batter, which we didn't like. The grilled asparagus was delicious, but our waiter suggested we not order much and that was puzzling to me because that was actually my favorite part of the meal. Also, is it petty of me to be unhappy that they didn't offer any bread for the table? The waiter said they didn't offer bread because people fill up on bread and aren't able to appreciate the meal, which he touted as \"only the best!\"  Well, after all of that, we enjoyed each other's company, but we left the restaurant hungry, and went to a hamburger joint a couple of hours later to satisfy our hunger. Btw, we spent $400!",

Appetizers were cotton candy foie gras,croquettes de pollo, beefsteak tomato tartare,beef Parmesan grisini, live scallop and charred octopus that all were presented beautifully and tasted great. We ordered the rosewood steak with sides of butter pureed potatoes, mushrooms and carrots.  They were also outstanding. Lastly, when I was emailing Pano I asked about dessert.

    "text": "Ah, Bazaar Meat. I finally got to take down this high-on-my-list restaurant choice and for the most part, was fairly satisfied with the experience as all Bazaars are quite...unique to say the least  (Timing-wise, on a Wednesday night, it wasn't busy at all. Not sure if how busy it is during the weekends so do make a RSVP ahead of time.) (Note 2: This is in the SLS Hotel as a heads-up near the back on the left-hand side.)  +The food itself is a bit all over the place so will be listing some things here and there. Note that the presentation here (like other Bazaars) can be a bit love-it-or-hate-it for some so make sure to be aware to be somewhat open-minded! Some of the best things here include Bazaar staples that you'll find at other restaurants like the croquetas (still good; still weird coming in the shoe), the rib eye (super delicious/well-cooked; comes by the pound), the lamb rack (also delicious; not super gamey), and the Don't Be A Lemon frozen cocktail drink (they make it for you table-side; super funky and need to drink it slow because of the liquid nitrogen but personally, thought it was delicious).   (By the way, some things require ordering way in advance like the suckling pig which people always seem to recommend.)  +Service was terrific from all sides. Lots of attention pouring water, great explanations about the food, and a sommelier are all on hand.  +Love the look of the place. Different kitchens to view all types of meat/cooking going on. You get to view most of the meat you're going to eat and the giant furnace they cook it on.   +/- I get that it's part of the 'show' but the menus...personally not a big fan of the gigantic slabs. But I digress.  +/- Also part of the experience is the wait time. The meat takes a while to cook so they recommend you go backwards from choosing the 'meat' you want to order to the smaller dishes. Just a heads-up.  +/- Food that was a bit in the middle for me included the brussel sprouts (had a unique addition of 'lemon air' that didn't jive completely on my end)  -As mentioned above, some of the food bears mentioning as disappointments. This includes the asparagus (a few cut up asparagus for what was at least $10+ didn't make sense including the lack of much interesting cooking that went with it) and the Cauliflower Steak (a bit bland).",

After my boss told me we were eating here I looked at him and laughed and said \"man I'm a Vegetarian\" and he laughed and said \"Oh yeah that's right!\"  Anyhow it was sponsored by another company and this is where we went to eat....  I've been to Jose Andres restaurants numerous times.   I've been to Bazaar at the SLS in Beverly Hills numerous times before I became a Vegetarian and it is a great place to eat...though portions are small....I also had their food when my friends got married at the SLS in Beverly Hills...Tres at SLS in Beverly Hills as well...Also, I've eaten at both Jaleo and China Poblano inside the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.    I'm going to say this now....of all the Jose Andres restaurants the one with the word \"Meat\" has the BEST VEGETARIAN meals....That might sound crazy...but I'm telling the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth!  Unfortunately Food came out so fast and the explanations were so quick as well that I could only share lovely pictures and give some excerpts of what I enjoyed most!  Tomato Gazpacho was awesome and I'm not the biggest fan of Gazpacho but this one was creamy and good. Potato Croquettes (I believe that's what they were) were really tasty and had the perfect crunch and flavor.... One of the best items but so small was the Avocado Puree with Tomato Caviar.... Tomato Tartare was pretty awesome.... Piquillo Peppers OMG that was so scrumptious every Non-Vegetarian that tried it wanted more! Finally, the roasted Cauliflower Steak was pretty good but I actually was so full at that point I am not sure I needed it.... Oh and the Dessert...I guess it was no big deal in my opinion but at the point you are eating this you are probably so stuffed from either the Vegetarian Items or all the Meats you eat (My group had Wagyu Beef, Beef Tartare, Suckling Pig and Suckling Lamb, Rib Eye and some others)....so yeah there were desserts and they were basically a non-factor at that point of the night of eating....  Vegetarians at Bazaar Meat raise your wine glasses and embrace this Meat restaurant!!!!!  I almost forgot the service and our server were impeccable!!!  I couldn't have asked for nicer service and servers!!!!!  Well informed and very attentive!",

The food is served family style, dishes to share.  I could go on and on about the delicious food and preparation. However, I want to point out the NOT so wonderful wine list. Don't get me wrong, it's a book full of mostly wine you haven't seen. Mostly Spanish wines. The wines you might recognize are expensive. Let's put it this way. Nothing below $100. The reason we were give \"It's imported\". Oh...really?  I think you can bring in your own wine. Check first. I would love to hear what the corking fee is.",

When my husband said he wanted to stick with water, the waiter made a face and immediately wrote us off. I guess he figured we weren't worth his time. He protested when we only ordered 1 fois gras (rather than 1 each), and was generally rude. At one point, he literally asked us if we were ready to order. We said yes, and he just walked away!!   Bizarre food, and not in the good way.   Cotton candy fois gras. Ordered because I was curious. \"Why would anyone put cotton candy and goose liver together? Maybe it's delicious!\" No. The reason no other restaurant in the world  puts goose liver on a stick and wraps it with spun sugar is that it's an abomination that should be cleansed with fire.   Geoduck was a minuscule portion ($26) with a coconut lime sauce and a yuzu. The two sauces were conflicting rather than complementary, and ended up muddled on the pallet. Definitely a miss.   Sea urchin has a delicate flavor and texture. Andres mixed it with pork fat, completely masking the flavor, and put it on a crostini, obliterating the texture. Dont get me wrong, bread and lard are delicious, but why pay $26 for it when they obscure the star and eponymous ingredient?   We were so disappointed that we decided not to order entrees. We cut our losses and went to Katsuya, an adorable and delicious Japanese bar a few doors down. I suggest you do the same.",

A while ago I became severely underwhelmed with dining experiences on the Strip as they were often to the same tune, a composition of being both overpriced and underdelivered. Good, not great.  Zero regrets at all on any dollar that I spent here. So good that I went first one week and went back the next with my mom who was visiting. Both times were exciting, whimsical, and unforgettable.   Staff is fantastic. Brian deserves a fantastic shout out for knowing how to contribute positively and effectively to your experience, whatever level of interaction you seek. Pano, the manager, truly made us feel like special guests with his sincerity and hospitality. Above and beyond.  Alas, as I always say.. you can't eat staff. The food here, however, is beyond memorable. Order a la carte, or enjoy the surprisingly affordable bar menu. Or you could get what's both exquisite and exceptional: their tasting menus.  Due to a rash of let-downs in Houston and New York, my entire family had given up on tasting menus in recent years, but Bazaar Meat renewed my faith in the magic, potential promise, and excitement of them. You should especially get the $185 one as a special treat. I promise that you will leave very full and with both a happy heart and belly!  I probably won't be able to eat elsewhere when I have friends/family come visit as this would be the #1 choice to take them for a dazzling evening out, but that's definitely not a bad thing at all as I'm already looking forward to the next time.   Pair with a show on the strip for a truly perfect evening out in Vegas. THIS is what you were looking for!",

The menu is meant for sharing and the atmosphere is very cool if you're a meat lover. The starters were perfection. The classic tartare by far the best I've had. The chicken fritters were so light and crispy. They're filled with a sort of rue and are so unique. For our main course, we shared the Washugyu bone in strip and the Grass Fed bone in strip. They took over an hour but unfortunately did not impress. Both steaks were extremely cold. The Grass fed Strip loin was over cooked, extremely fatty and tough. The Washugyu was undercooked however still tasty but really cold as well. I still recommend CUT if you're in Vegas and looking a steak but still worth trying.",

Let me tell you, whatever your dietary restrictions, this place will do everything to accommodate it. Having said that, it's a heaven for meat lovers, which is what my husband is all about.  We started with gazpacho shots, croquetas de pollo and patatas bravas. Every dish is made to PERFECTION!!  The gazpacho shots (tomato, cucumber and bell peppers) for $3 a shot, so refreshing and perfect balance of crunch and tangy, what a way to start.  Chicken croquettes, what a great presentation, served in a transparent plastic shoe, had the crispy outside and melty bechamel inside, DELICIOUS. Patatas bravas, the best I had in my life. The garlic aioli is to die for. Hubby tried flat iron steak with blue cheese sauce, loved it. I had cauliflower steak, never had anything like this. Served over a bed of creamy cauliflower puree had the Perfect char on top with pine nuts and salad with lemony dressing... so yummm! Our server Tony was the best, try to request him, he made our visit exceptional. He surprised us with the most amazing assortment of desserts! There were 10 Bite size desserts, wish I could remember the names of them all, tiramisu cream puff, dark chocolate rum dome with gold flakes, pineapple cheesecake, salted caramel something, you lost me there, others are in the pic. We wiped that plate clean!!  Then he got us this amazing dessert called \"pop rocks bonbons\" MUST Try!!  The guy refilling water and clearing our plates was so efficient. They also have lots of options with tasting menus, I was told that the entire chefs tasting menu can be made vegetarian or whatever your dietary need is.  From start to finish, this was one of the best dinner experience. Can't wait to return.",

I can tell from their smiles and the waiters' attitudes that this meal will be good.   I respect Joe Andre for his philanthropic trip to feed Puerto Rico after the hurricane and his fame in the DC area for the innovative as well as delicious cooking. I am glad my friend choose this place for our night out.   Foie gras cotton candy, why didn't I think about this combo before? I guess my name is not Jose Andre. The waiter told me to flatten the cotton candy and swallow it in one bite. Not a chance! In front of my guy friends??? I took a quarter bite to make sure I bite off the Center to get a piece of Foie gras with cotton candy. My friend did swallow the whole big bite and moaned with satisfaction. :)). The olive app is ok for olive lovers but it is too salty for me.   Although I didn't get to try the set menu that requires everyone on the table to order, I get to share the porterhouse  from Washington State. I think it is great to encourage the customers to share the steak instead of promoting the over consumption of food. Medium rare only please. If anyone orders the steak well done, they should get kicked out to eat Mc Donald instead. The steak is lean and so good when it cooked right. A part of our medium rare is well done. The waiter showed his apology with a tray of desserts. Thank you.  Our steak goes well with the potato side dishes like Patatas Bravas and asparagus. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I was visiting Vegas for work and a friend suggested Bazaar Meat. I almost missed out on this gem, because my coworkers were not as adventurous.   My last night, I decided to go check it out. I am so glad that I did!!! I've been raving about it ever since (it's been a month.) I will be back here on my next trip.   First let me tell you, I was overwhelmed by the menu! Everything looked amazing and I wanted it all. I was sitting at the bar and I asked the bartender for recommendations. He told me to order from the bar menu so that I could order a variety. This was the best advice ever!   I started with the Wagyu Tartare Sliders. (Side bar, I saw the tartare options on the menu beforehand and really wanted it, but didn't want to commit to the whole thing by myself.) the sliders were the perfect amount. These were great, but I personally could've gone for straight up tartare - hold the bread.   Next, I ordered the salmon lox. OMG no one prepared me for how this would impact my life. This was hands down the best thing I had. The crispy light vessel, the salmon roe that had been marinated...every detail worked together.   I also ordered the Cotton Candy Foie Gras, well, because I had to based on all of the yelp pictures. Get it. The most delicious bite of sweet and savory.   I ordered a few other small things, but these were my favorites. I also have to mention the service here. The bartender was friendly and helpful. He walked me through the menu and gave plenty of recommendations. He understood my goal - try as many different things as I could without going crazy.   I must also say that you can end up with a hefty tab here if you're not careful. I'm speaking from experience. Just know that you're not coming here to be cheap.",

Once we entered we were faced with the impressive wood-burning grills and glass refrigerator with shelves stocked with massive cuts of thighs, rumps, legs and shoulders of various animals.  I get the whole gourmet meat experience of high-quality steaks and oxtail, bacon skins and duck liver cotton candy... but it's a lot. At least for me. I'm mostly pescatarian and I found the menu quite limited unless you literally just want copious amounts of red meat in thick sauces and butter, there's little veggies or seafood. It felt very glutinous and honestly the croquettes I ordered were okay, very greasy and over the top salty-cheesy, just not for me. I ordered a salad which was literally 8-10 giant leaves with a few carrot sticks and cucumber slices. I made like a lettuce wrap/taco with a few pieces of carrots and cucumber as my meal. We also ordered the salmon tartare which was very gamey-wild tasting and we didn't finish it. Our friends ordered the duck liver cotton candy and pork skins, which they commented were okay.  The biggest con was the service. We sat at the bar to eat and drink and our waiter/bartender would walk past us with his finger up to indicate one second, even though it was not busy at all. Our party would flag him down repeatedly and we'd see him chatting with the other bartender or making drinks, I get it, we are not your only customers, but three or four times the One Second finger gets old. We're not demanding you drop everything immediately and only attend to us, but come on...You either want to take our order or not.  I don't think I'd return.",

The dessert was really nice as well - there was some raspberry and chambord going on with a delicious chocolate gold ingot filled with cookie butter. I recommend this spot wholeheartedly.",

We definitely left a little disappointed by Bazaar meats though, the service here fell short by a mile but the other reviews mentioned this already. I honestly felt the food fell short a bit too.   The appetizers here feature a few of the favorites from the bazaar in LA and those were still good, but the meat portion was just ok. We got the ribeye tasting which features 6oz of steak and i didn't enjoy it all that much.   The tartare on the other hand was huge in portion and really good!   They also were not careful with my dairy allergy. They served plenty of things with dairy without warning and it was a little strange for an upscale restaurant. If you have allergies, please be careful.   We were going to dine at e by Jose andres next trip, but I think we will save it for a different restaurant instead now.",

Can't recall ever doing that at a steakhouse so I had my hopes up. Add to it that thing is owned by a world renown chef and i was thinking it would be the best steak ever.   Admittedly it wasn't the best steak I've had in Vegas, and the sides were a not overwhelming. But the meat options were the most unique I've ever seen (wild boar sausage/suckling pig?!) The ambiance and service were also good, so that's a plus. But I can't put this place above CUT or several others. Still worth giving a shot if you are staying on that end of the strip.",

My family splurged on the full tasting menu, and we really could have spent another couple of hours at this place eating, drinking and chatting with our service team lead, Tony. I don't think I even got pictures of everything! Highlights of the meal were the suckling pig, the wagyu, the potato puree (seriously!), the Asian taco, Iberico ham...wait, I'm listing my whole meal. Service was exceptional, and I even hugged Tony on the way out, he was so nice. I need to go back when I don't have a show I am heading to! Worth the slight detour from the usual hotels in Vegas!",

The charcuterie board that had a variety of cured meat was amazing, best I ever had. The Wagu beef was the star of the show. They cook it right in front of you.   Sad that we didn't try much dishes but definitely will go back for their tasting menu.",

Lets start off by saying the ambience gave a modern feel yet artistic and luxurious.  We sat near the bar and was given the pleasure to watch Zach and Aaron make our drinks. They made them with such accuracy it was incredible to watch (my favorite was the cotton candy one) Zach made it at the table which I thought was so neat. It was fun to watch. Zach also explained every dish to us, with the history and description to a T. Eddie, the manager was so attentive and kind. He made us feel so welcomed and cared for. I recommend this steakhouse as you won't be disappointed. Hopefully next time I go Zach and Aaron will be there!",

The suckling pig was good but the price were quite steep.  Rib eyes could use a little flare to the presentation and marinate.  Good selections of wines but it comes with a high price tags too.  My biggest disappointment was that 90% of dishes we ordered were over salt.  Mixed drinks are fun especially it's a crowd pleaser when one orders cotton candy mojitos and the bartender pour liquid nitrogen to incorporate science effects to entertain you and your friends.  Great ambient leaning toward chic & trendy.  Servers were pleasant and accommodated to one's needs.",

I loved the cotton candy foie gras, but it was the foie gras s'mores that won my heart. I had the liquid nitrogen \"drink\". It's a sorbet with alcohol they make table side, and so good and fun. Everything we had was delicious and had a fun presentation. The service is slow and relaxed pace if you are getting many small dishes so leave plenty of time for dinner. It is very pricy for small bites, but so worth it. We left full and happy, but not overwhelmingly full, which was actually nice after a big dinner. The atmosphere is also so much fun.",

So extraordinary that I would find myself regaling those gracious enough to listen with stories of how delicious the food was, and how incredible the service had been.  Filled with high expectations, four of us dined there in December to accomplish a bucket-list type of food experience.  The service is still fantastic and the staff caters to your wants and needs without being obsequious or intrusive.  The foie gras cotton candy was interesting and delicious and something I would highly recommend.  The rib eye, on the other hand, was nothing special and lacked the savory, caramelized deliciousness of a properly seared steak.  The lamb was good but nothing to write sonnets about and the big disappointment was the Robuchon potatoes which was heavily salted, enough so to be a distraction to the rest of the meal. My dinner companions thought the experience was great, and perhaps I had too high expectations and fell victim to my over romanticized memory.  My harsh critique on the decline in food quality was somewhat vindicated when at another bucket-list restaurant, our waiter informed us that a large segment of the staff left Bazaar a few months earlier. Make no mistake, this is still a fine establishment, but for $600 I was expecting a bit more, a bit more like I remembered.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant and fun concept.  I'm a huge fan of Jose Andres' creative dishes, but some of my selections of the night just either didn't impress, or were poorly prepared for the price you are paying.  Here is a breakdown of what we ordered:  * The Lhardy's Madrid Beef Consomme (Sherry wine, quail egg, caviar): While the soup was good, I was not blown away.  Generally, when a dish is this small, it packs a world of flavor in those few mouthfuls.  I appreciated the raw quail egg, which gave the consomme a creamier consistency, but I felt as though the caviar was a waste as it didn't really add anything to the soup -- not taste nor texture.  Both of the brininess and texture that you enjoy in caviar got lost, being that the broth was already seasoned enough.  Probably not a recommendation.  * Cotton Candy Foie Gras (crispy amaranth): This was, without a doubt, my favorite dish of the night.  THIS was a dish in which creativity and flavor both succeeded.  I am not a big fan of sweets, so I was hesitant to order a dish with cotton candy, however, my love for foie gras dominates all.  The foie, covered with just the right amount of crispy amaranth for texture, was the perfect salty contrast to break the sweetness of the cotton candy.  You'll have to make your way through a bit of cotton candy to reach the foie at the center, but once you're there, you'll find that cool, creamy delight of livery goodness.  * Abalone (Dashi gelee, lemon, soy, salmon roe): I love abalone.  Don't expect to get a huge portion size for the price -- this dish really just celebrates the simplicity of this rare treat in tiny portions.  The soft, briny salmon roe was just the right pairing to contrast the chewy sweetness of the abalone.  * Beef Tartare with Oysters (fried egg, oyster sauce, pan de cristal): This dish truly was a let down.  It's probably the worst tartare I can remember tasting.  The only upside to this dish was the portion size.  It definitely got me full, but it was so salty that it was almost inedible.  I regret not sending it back, but our server was so nice that I think I just felt bad.  I'm not sure if I was a fan of the three oysters mushed into the tartare, either.  * Grilled Maine Lobster (Beurre Monte): While the flavors were on point, I'm not sure if it was worth it.  There wasn't much meat!  It says two pounds, but it was mainly all shell.  I was practically sucking on the shell because the charred flavoring was so delicious, but also because I was hoping that meat would magically appear.  * Grilled Asparagus (Romesco sauce): Another over-seasoned dish.  Great charred flavor on the asparagus (these were much smaller than I'm used to), but I couldn't get past the fact that my tongue felt shriveled up after every few bite.  As touched upon, I really liked our server.  While she made minor mistakes, which wasn't entirely her fault as it could have been some simple miscommunication on my end, her attention to detail and attentiveness was great.  Random note: my boyfriend and I did wait almost a half hour past our reservation time to be seated.  We were told that the tables for the 9:30pm reservations were not ready, though we saw quite a few open spots.  Could have been understaffed, but who knows.  Overall, a mediocre meal.  I regret not ordering many of the other dishes that I had my eye on, such as the Sea Urchin with Iberico lardo, or the many recommendations I now had a chance to read on Yelp.  As much as some of the dishes did not please me, I do want to give Bazaar another chance the next time I visit, as there are so many options and it is quite the enjoyable, different dining experience.",

    "text": "I was so excited about trying Bazaar Meat as I have been to the Bazaar location in LA several times & loved it. Let's just say this isn't the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. Upon arrival the atmosphere is fun, crocodiles on the ceiling, fun mismatched chairs, & an upscale hunting lodge type ambiance. The mismatched lamps so close together makes one feel as though they are in a lamps plus though. The place doesn't know what it is. We were told that it was similar to the Bazaar in LA in that it had tapas, but the tapas were more centered around meats. We asked about every dish we ordered & were told all of them were tapas size but this is not the case. There are a few tapas at the top of the menu but the rest are full size meat & veggie dishes. The menu is confusing. The servers try to explain things but there is to much to cover. If it wants to be a steak house be a steak house, if it wants to be a tapas place specializing in meat then it should be that but trying to be both isn't working.  The prices are astronomical for the quality. Especially since Cleo is next-door & has the best Mediterranean tapas I have ever had at reasonable prices with a casual unpretentious attitude. Bazaar Meat is trying not to be pretentious but it still is a bit & if you don't order the expensive meat dishes you can see the disappointment from your server. Timing was off as well. I know tapas come at all different times but some things came right away & at the same time while other things came almost too late. Our server was extremely professional & seemed to really enjoy his job. He had great knowledge of the menu. Here is what we ordered: Air bread Kobe sandwich- this item was not on the menu but they were making it special & it was delicious. The best thing I had all night. If you are familiar with the Bazaar in LA, they have an air bread Philly cheese steak & this is similar. I have no idea how they get the bread to be so light & airy & when you bite into it the cheese just melts out. Top it off with fig jam & the Kobe beef & you have yourself a delectable treat. Its $12 for one small sandwich but it is worth every penny.   Air bread Ruben- Same air bread with the melted cheese concept but I preferred the Kobe beef to the Reuben & didn't care for the thousand island or sauerkraut.  Brussel sprouts with fruit & lemon air- this dish sounded interesting but proved  inedible. It had a horrible smell & the lemon air was weird. The taste was atrocious & the fruit did not go at all. I took one bite & was done with that. It was  a large portion & not a tapas size. Cauliflower- 2 servers told us how amazing it was, one told us it tasted like candy. The cauliflower was half black & had a strong burned Smokey flavor that overpowered all the other flavors. There were slivers of lemon on top which made it taste a little better but I don't recommend this dish. Sloppy Joes- comes with 2 sandwiches that are way bigger than the air bread ones. They are a fun blast back to childhood but that is exactly what it is. They tasted like what you would have gotten in your school lunch & not the gourmet version I was hoping for. Classic Beef Tartar- This one is neat because it's made at your table.  I am not a big fan of raw meat dishes but in any case it did not taste good at all. The parker rolls it came with were great though and you can make little sliders with it.  Chicken croquets- this one is fun as it's served in a plastic converse sneaker. My husband didn't like these, he thought they tasted like fair food but I really liked them. They are supposed to taste like fried chicken potpie, which they do & I think they taste great. It would be great if there were little pieces of carrots and peas like a real potpie, but they do taste great. Don't be a lemon nitrogen drink- this is amazing. If you have had the one in LA its similar to that. It has rum & lemon flavors with edible flowers. The consistency of the nitrogen is like nothing you have ever tasted before. It's a feast for your senses. Truly phenomenal. Vanilla bean ice cream experience- this is another feast for your senses. You get 3  scoops of Madagascar vanilla bean ice cream with crushed pieces of an ice cream cone recipe from 1920. You get 3 sifters, one with coffee beans, Madagascar vanilla bean, & aged rum. You smell the sifter & then eat the ice cream & drink the rum. The rum is excellent & the whole experience is really fun & decadent. 10 piece dessert sampler- some of these were good but I was not blown away with much. The cream puffs I highly recommend, this one came with hazelnut cream. Mango cake not great. Fruit tarts were good but really tart. Pomegranate tart not great. Salted caramel & coffee chocolate were good. You can get it in a to go box so I had it for breakfast. Jasmine green tea- excellent. Best green tea I have ever had, coffee is amazing as well. I would come back here for the air bread, nitrogen cocktail, tea & dessert. If you want an excellent tapas meal go to Cleo.",

I consider my tastes for red meat and meat in general to be heads above the general populace AND ,I cook very well and am the closest thing to a \"Pitmaster\" my friends and family know. Having said that and sufficiently hurting my own arm patting myself on the back I'll get on with my review.  So wife and I have a romantic weekend planned and in our search for hotel and food we found the SLS and then found Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres.   We sat at 10 pm. The last sitting. The restaurant was still packed. It had a slight pretentious smoky hunter appeal to it.  When you walk in the ovens and kitchen are all open and exposed. Fire was the first thing I saw and then the cooking meat smells wrapped around my head like a wicked banshee leading me to my table.  The ordering was a little different but our waiter was by far one of the most professional waiters I've ever met. Based on our tastes he guided us through the menus and everything we ate was PHENOMENAL!!!!.  I would gladly return to this restaurant and I would recommend. This place to all of my friends and family.",

If you're from LA, you know what I'm taking about. the Bazzar known for small tapas, each filled with mind blowing flavors and display. Well, the Bazzar really kept up to its name and took it to another level of goodness. The decor once again is stylish and cool. Staff is friendly. Food is just so nicely served. It is a real treat to go there and experience a meal.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything from the menu, and note that bar has a different menu from the restaurant and much more affordable too!  We got the 1) short rib 2) suckling pig and 3) octopus. Short rib was a bit salty but meat was real tender. Suckling pig was HUGE and juicy. Octopus was fresh.  I don't know what else to say but to go and try it!",

Located in the SLS Hotel way, way, way down the Strip, it's worth the cab ride over.   After going through 6 different menus, we ordered a bunch of meat selections and the ham croquettes, chicharron and Spanish blood sausages were my favorite dishes. Also had the king crab & shrimp cocktail and A5 Kobe, which you have to try as rare as possible to enjoy the flavor. I would pass on this but they do give you a certificate that you've had the A5 cut, which was comical and makes for a unique dinner souvenir.  We ordered the server's recommended cut of steak as a main course, which is cooked over the spitfire. For me, even as medium rare, it was a little dried but I guess that's a preference. I would not order the steak again and would stick to the other dishes. Only thing we ordered that we didn't care for at all was the Brussels sprouts served with a lemon foam. Yuck! Wish we had more people in our party to order the suckling pig. Maybe next time.   Definitely recommend saving room for the dessert cart. The chocolate mint cake is divine. Service was great. Jhon Anthony, our server, was pretty good with his recommendations. Definitely on our repeat list.",

I'm a big fan of Jose Andres, I frequently go to Jaleo and China Poblano, and I invite most of the people who come in town to those restaurants. But my experience this time at Bazaar was very bad. I ordered a 250$ wine that my friend told me will be very good. The sommelier came to the table and presented the wine to her, never looked at me, talked or even acknowledge my presence. No even a hello. We were only 2. He just talked to her, explained to her the wine, even got close to her to explain more until I actually mention that I will like to hear about it too.  He said \"Oh, sorry\" and explained little to me. I complained, it was extremelly rude, unpolite and they apologized, bla bla. The house invited me a rose that I normally don't like, nobody asked if that was something I will like to drink.  The food was great, but I did not enjoyed anymore as the way I was treated was very poor and I was already annoyed. The stars are for the waiter, Chris who save the night, he was really good. The check was 500$, and to be honest, too much to be treated like that. Not going back.",

    "text": "If you've ever eaten at a Jose Andres restaurant, you'll expect to either spend a lot of money or go home hungry. I've been to Bazaar in LA, Jaleo, and E, so I think the element of surprise has subsided for me. I think Bazaar Meat is a great restaurant for special occasions and puts on a great show for first timers.  They make some drinks tableside, including one with liquid nitrogen (more like a lemon sorbet) and one with cotton candy. But tricks aside, the food is still spot on.   Our waiter described the menu in detail to our table of 9, and suggested pretty much doing 2 of everything. Most dishes are designed to feed groups of 3-5, and it's hard to share 1/2 a bite each.   We started off with the cotton candy foie gras, Jose's Asian taco, Reuben, croquetas de jamon, giant chicharron, patatas bravas, chefs selection of cured meats and the toasted pan de cristal with fresh tomato. I'd say that my lesser favorites were the \"taco\" and the patata bravas, but each dish is only a bite per person anyway so it's worth the try.   We ordered 2 of the Rosewood Texas Wagyu Beef Rib Steaks, and I think it was overhyped for me. It was cooked perfectly medium rare, but I expected a lot more flavor from a ribeye.  I think that it's good if you're craving steak, but it's not the best ribeye I've had. Keep in mind that you are charged for the steak per pound with the bone in, so it does come out to be pretty expensive.   We also ordered the Butifarra spiral, which is pork sausage served with tomato toast. The aioli was a really delicious pairing with the sausage, and this dish definitely made sure we were full at the end. We also had the potato puree which was loaded with butter and very tasty. The cauliflower side was pretty good, but the Brussels sprouts petals were just Ok.   Lastly, dessert. There's a dessert cart that they wheel to your table that makes you wanna try everything. And we really did try at least 10 different desserts and all were delicious. It just depends what you're craving: chocolate, caramel, fruit tarts, smores, etc.   I want to thank our server and the restaurant manager, Pano, for making our dining experience amazing despite the restaurant being very busy that night. We will be back again, especially to try their happy hour!",

As A mother of seven I don't get out very often unless it's Chuck e cheese. This was one of the best times I've had in a long long time. John even brought my son a little cake with a candle and wished him a happy birthday,  nothing crazy but still the best.  THANK YOU BAZAAR MEAT,  AND THANK YOU BAZAAR KITCHEN FAMILY. TRULY AMAZING AND TALENTED PEOPLE.",

The lemon/nitrogen cocktail, is also unique- they make the cocktail tableside. The potatoe puree was sooooooo good- its just buttery goodness that melts in your mouth!!!

Alas, it was my birthday weekend and I had my excuse. Me and my girlfriend made reservations and a quick cab ride we were there. Started off at the bar since we had a ten minute wait which was not a problem at all. The greeters and bartenders were professional and friendly. As I mentioned before Andrew inspired me to try restaurant. Aside from the fact that I am a big Andres fan being half Spanish from the basque country. So we went with the cotton candy foie gras, super giant pork skin chicharones and the morcilla with uni. My personal favorite was the morcilla with uni. Morcilla or blood sausage is a food that I have grown up with since my beginning. The cotton candy was a fun take on foie gras and was equally good. The chicharones however were average at best. The theatrical way the waiter cracked the giant chicharone was fun but for me it lacked flavor which was a bummer. They do provide a sauce with it which saved it. To end the night we ordered the braised lamb neck with fried oysters and potatoes! My girlfriend loved that dish! I as well especially the oysters. Oh, before I forget we had bread sticks wrapped in jamon serrano or iberico, I forget which. Delicious! All in all I highly recommend Jose Andres Bazaar Meats! Next time I will try the meats!",

And the amount of food you get for the price is small. But... Here, I'm also paying for the experience.  The food is inventive and fun to eat.  All of my fellow diners really enjoyed!  I was with a party if 9 and we ate tapas style, so here are my thoughts on each.   Amazing: - corned beef sandwich (fun!) - made at table beef tartare (fun!) - bison buffalo tacos (fun!) - by the pound ribeye (very flavorful!) - lamb (very flavorful) - chicken croquets  - yellowfin sushi - mushroom side (flavored like escargot usually is - garlic!) - signature cotton candy drink  Okay, would eat again: - Brussels  - grilled cauliflower  - desert (we got $50 sampler - it was just okay - a lot of $2 chocolates on it which makes the price really not worth it) - smoked oysters (I'm not a fan of oysters but my fellow diners liked) - liquid nitrogen table side drink (strong, but fun to watch them make)  Not a fan: - suckling pig (this is their signature dish and I don't get it- fatty on the inside and super crunchy on the outside. Not tasty and a weird mix of textures for me. Most of my fellow diners agree.) - fish entree (this is entire fish option. I should have remembered rule of thumb - don't order fish in a meat restaurant. Not fresh!!! No one at my table of 9 liked)",

    "text": "We chose this restaurant as it is one of only 10 restaurants in the United States that are authorized to sell authentic Kobe beef. Many restaurants may claim to sell Kobe beef, but unless they're one of the 10 listed on the Kobe Beef Association website, it's not actually Kobe! There are extremely high standards that must be met for meat to be sold with the Kobe label - the strictest of all beef in Japan - and only around 5,000 head of Tajima-gyu cattle each year are able to meet these stringent requirements.  Fortunately for us, every aspect of our dining experience at Bazaar Meat was just as fantastic and high quality as the Kobe beef they sell!  The appetizers are tapas-style and served in smaller portions, so we were able to enjoy a range of flavors without worrying about ordering too large of a quantity of any single dish.   We started our meal with one piece each of the foie gras, wrapped in a fluffy white cloud of cotton candy, served ice cold. While very good, there's a momentary shock as the cotton candy begins to melt and your brain tries to reconcile the flavor of the ice cold block of foie gras inside! If you enjoy foie gras it's not to be passed up, and the $8 price seems reasonable for such a unique taste.  Next, we shared the beef and parmesan grissini, which had a generous portion of thinly sliced Washugyu carpaccio wrapped around grissini (a type of Italian bread stick) and served with a bowl of espuma and caramelized onion puree to dip in. The Washugyu carpaccio was very tender and buttery, and practically melted in my mouth. The flavors of the beef worked very well with the espuma and puree, and while $26 for this appetizer might seem a bit high, you get five bread sticks with a very generous portion of the Washugyu beef. I thought this was well worth the price, and highly recommend it if you have even the slightest interest in carpaccio (or, especially, if you've never tried it) - you won't regret it.  Though I don't enjoy caviar, my husband does, so he ordered the flight of rainbow trout, salmon, and flying fish roe. For $45, you get a 2 ounce portion of caviar served on a glass waterfall that includes all the trimmings: egg whites, egg yolks, shallots, chives, capers, and a tube of creme fraiche. He said the caviar was quite good - much better quality roe than you might be used to if you're familiar with it from sushi. It came with a pomme souffle that was very buttery and crispy, almost like a very puffy potato chip, and we had to get another basket of them because I kept eating his!  For our last appetizer, we got the reuben, served on air bread. Neither of us had ever tasted air bread before, and it really does live up to the name, as it's so light as to be almost ethereal. While the flavor was excellent, we probably wouldn't order it again as the portion size you get for $12 is little more than two rather small bites, and $8 would seem a more appropriate price. It's a minor quibble at best, and I don't regret trying it if only for the unique air bread it was served on.  I ordered the Romaine on ice salad, that featured whole leaves of Romaine lettuce standing upright in a large bucket of ice, served with miniature radishes and a side of ranch dressing. When it came to the table we both stared at it for a minute or two in confusion as there was no plate or knife to cut the lettuce with - until we realized that you're supposed to eat it as a  finger food and dip it into the ranch dressing! The ranch was quite good, not your standard mass-produced dressing, and the portion size was just right for $15.  I initially chose the Wagyu/Black Angus beef rib steak, but the staff were very on point when they suggested that it would be much too large of a steak for me, as you don't order a specific weight of meat and the steak averages about two pounds. They instead recommended the grass-fed Angus bone-in strip loin from Strauss Farm, cooked medium rare. I was quite happy with their choice, as it was VERY tender, expertly seasoned, and cooked perfectly medium rare.  The star of the dinner, and the reason we came, was my husband's six ounce A5 Kobe Beef Eye of the Rib steak. Words are simply inadequate to describe how good this steak is, and it more than lived up to its reputation as the best beef in the world. The steak is cooked tabledside (by a specially trained chef) on a Ishiyaki grilling stone, who explained that he would cook it in two portions so it didn't get cold. The stone is greased with a cube of fat rendered from the same cow as the steak and brushed with a fresh wasabi and soy glaze. We tried it rare for the first portion, and medium rare for the second. The beef was so tender and well marbled that it melts in your mouth, and the taste and texture were phenomenal in every way. For $50 an ounce, it was worth every penny, and came with a certificate verifying its authenticity.  Including wine and tip, we paid $900 for our meal and enjoyed every part of our experience!",

For $185 pp we choose the \"middle road\" tasting menu and we were all left perplexed at the terrible service all around and the mediocre food. Even the hostess forgot us at the bar as we waited for our reservation. Salt appears to be the preeminent spice of choice here up and down the menu, including the dessert options. With the mediocre food and terrible service it was difficult to swallow (much like the chiccarrone) the $185 pp menu. I get that dining on the strip comes with a premium attached to your bill, but this was way way overpriced for what we got.",

    "text": "First, I'd like to say that anyone who doesn't give this  place 5 stars is delusional!!   This is, hands down, the best restaurant we have ever gone too.. and we've been to a lot of restaurants!  The first thing that hits you when you enter is the wonderful smokey smell coming from the open fire grill!   Then the visual... eclectic ambience.  As we walked past the open grill / meat station, I was utterly mesmerized by the amazing selection of gorgeous steaks and chops!  We were seated and started looking at the menu.. admittedly, we were overwhelmed at first because literally ALL of our favorite things are on that menu - oysters, caviar, iberico jamon, foie gras, aged steaks and even those famous potatoes!  We decided on the Jose's Way tasting menu augmented with an order of that heavenly jamon.  On the server's suggestion, I started with a glass of Cava (delightful) and my husband had a smoked cocktail, the name of which I can't recall, but which tasted wonderful (and I don't even like bourbon).  This accompanied our first few courses, all of which were beyond wonderful.. smoke and ice oysters (wow!!!) stuffed olives, liquid olives (how the heck do they do  that?!) and that candy cane foie gras (surreal) !!!!  There was some fabulous steak tartare, too!  We ordered a bottle of Faustino red wine to have with the rest of our meal and it was very good.    The iberico jamon gets a paragraph of its own... no words can describe how good this was.  I died and went to heaven, plain and simple.    The tomato tartare was wonderful - came with lettuce leaves for wrapping and it was a nice counterpoint to the meats.  The main meal included a lovely roasted cauliflower, asparagus with a piquant tomato sauce, those buttery potatoes and a Rosewood TX rib-eye steak.  The steak had a lovely salt crust, smokey flavor and was cooked to  perfection.    The dessert selection that came at the very end was just right after such a large and wonderful meal.  I would do this again in a heartbeat!  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!  Thank you Jose Andreas!",

Reservations was on time. We sat at the bar and I enjoyed a nice legit old fashion. We were called to be seated in a nice booth. Our server was cool, quick, & informative. I'll shall edit and add his name later on.  I liked how honest our server was to help us choose the $175 per person tastings verses the $275 menu. That way we can learn and have an idea what the restaurant is all about. He also threw in 2 complimentary tastings!  We started out with the lox and bagel which is one of my favorite tastings along with the olives & puree olives,Foe Grais with cotton candy, the chichiron with a fluffy dip was tasty, charcuterie board, grass fed Wagyu beef cheeks, mash potatoes au gratin,applewood oysters, roasted cauliflower with cauliflower puree, meat tartare sliders, croquetas de pollo, asparagus over romesco sauce, followed by desserts (chocolates). Sounds like a lot but remember these are small tastings and was good for 2 people.  Everything tasted so delicious. I had a second drink in between ( Aladdin Smoked) to sip on and it was pretty good. The reason for dropping 2 stars was 1) next day I got really bad food poisoning. My husband asked for medium rare for the wagyu. It came out pretty rare but I ate it anyways thinking that's how it's suppose to be prepared. I also think maybe the tartare didn't help and it's possible my stomach cannot handle it. My husband was fine. Was bummed I nearly vomit all day during our last day in vegas. 2) I was hoping more of a explanation of what we were eating, maybe some education on how it's made or with what. Restaurant seemed so busy and loud, we couldn't hear anything.   Overall, as first timers, it was cool. It was a neat experience and if we come back, we would prob skip the tastings, order a meal, and make sure our meat is cooked more. It's too bad we spent about $500 and I ended up getting sick. I am glad my husband enjoyed his bday dinner!",

    "text": "What a great experience.  After a couple visits I think you either need a larger party of 4-5 people if you want to order items individually or order a tasting menu (they have 3).  I say that because some of the items are rich...and are fantastic as 1 piece...but if you were to eat 5 of them would be overwhelming. We did the top shelf tasting (the $275 ea one) and were blown away. Everything was great....and they brought out extra goodies for my son to try. Our waiter (Matt I believe, the surfer guy for management reference) was absolutely fantastic and part of the experience.  I came back and ordered items individually and like I said some can be overwhelming as the portions are bigger.   P.s suckling pig omg",

    "text": "This was one of our most disappointing dining experiences. The service was Five Stars and Elias was \"Gold Standard!\"  What was initially disappointing was the serving size of the pig next to the price point.  The steak was cooked very well but lacked flavor. Unfortunately, I have dined for much cheaper with the same if not better quality.  What drives this low rating is when I'm paying for a very overpriced meal and as I was trying to rationalize on the great environment and commenting on the ambience, a group of t-shirt and flip flop beach bums are seated at the table next to our group.  If I'm paying over 600 dollars for a meal that requires me to stop at a drive thru because I'm still hungry from overprices samples, the establishment could at least allow the experience to not be ruined by customers who did not dress based on what I thought was an establishment that is priced to dress up.  Sadly, our table came to the consensus this is a \"no return\" experience and I wouldn't recommend it.  Too many other establishments provide an experience that aligns with the bill.  Over 600 dollars is a rip off for a couple bites of pig, a steak, sides and some assorted desserts.  I paid half that for a much better experience at Echo and Rig.",

Simple, amazing food and outstanding service.    First the food.... what sets Bazaar apart from the others is not only how delicious the food is but how unique the dishes are. You eat things that you'd never think would work but they do! Foie gras s'mores or cotton candy foie, liquid olives etc...please look at the menu it's crazy. And presentation is whimsical and beautiful.    Secondly and just as impressive is the service. All the servers are awesome but for this review I'd like to take time to praise manager Pano.    Knowing it was our third trip here he went beyond our expectations to give us a marvelous experience.      First giving us a tour of the restaurant which included background on everything from the decor to Chef Andres vision of Bazaar meat. We put ourselves in his capable(and knowledge) hands when it's came to ordering our food. He put together and perfect menu of cocktails and appetizers for us. He(and servers) explained not only the dish but a little story on it's origin(chicken croquets served in a tennis shoe for instance).     An absolute perfect experience... thank you Pano, Chef Andres should be very proud of his exceptional and passionate employee(s)!",

Service was polished and consistent from everyone on staff, and we never had an empty water glass or empty plate at the table.  Our server was professional and friendly, and helped me navigate the wine menu.  He suggested the perfect glass of luscious Mencia red when I told him what I preferred.  We started out with the Vitorre 1950 Carpaccio (Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing), which was amazing. It was the perfect temperature and wonderfully seasoned.  I exclaimed that I could've eaten three more plates!   Our main course consisted of the Chateaubriand Tenderloin with Perigord sauce and pomme souffle. and the Delmonico potatoes with cream and cheddar cheese.  We were a little underwhelmed with the size of the steak (it said 20 oz on the menu, but looked much smaller than that), but the flavor was out of this world.  The potatoes were just as amazing.  Dessert consisted of small bites from a whimsical dessert cart.  We chose the chocolate tart and the eclair, both of which were ultra rich and, while they initially looked really small, were perfect in both size and flavor.  Any larger and they would've been a little too rich to finish.  Overall, our experience was wonderful, and we can't wait to return!",

Once inside the restaurant you are transported to chef jose andreas's food wonderland!!  -Visually fun to look at, open kitchen design. -Music level perfect to have conversations.  The place was packed on a mid week night. Yes make resos.. this is north of the strip ..yes worth the 15.00 uber from the strip!    Farm to table?  You bet ya! -you can see where the meat is sourced from -aging of the meats.  We had:  it all.. -The sausages are to Die for!  -They cut your steak to order, grill on a a sick a#% grill that raises, lowers depending on how you want the meat cooked.  Yes the steak takes 45 min to cook.. this is not freeking sizzlers folks.     -salads, foie gras cotton candy lollis !! Yes! Yum! -sides all were good except the weird soggy Brussel sprouts.. ewe that needs to be taken off the menu..  soggy, 80's version of what we all did NOT like about the mini cabbs.  Service on point like all of jose's restaurants!! Bravo! Ive been to e a few times in Vegas and the bazzar in LA.    This place is yet another wonderful way to celebrate food, friends, or like we had a great business meal with colleagues.   Id come back again.. to bring accounts,  a date, friends.   What a wonderful  way to honor the food we take from mother earth.",

So bright and full of flavors definitely a new favorite. The table side presentation of the drinks and melt in your mouth A5 Kobe beef were such a treat. Desserts were sweet and just right.

Great service, decent menu, consider coming with a few friends to share/taste different dishes.  We gave our server a price point that we wanted to stick around per person and he helped us come up with a nice tasting menu.  Some of it is a little gimmicky for me (cotton candy foie grass and lox bagel cone) but was fun to try.  If you are looking for more than just a good meal consider ordering a few \"little starters\" but if it was me I would go for a perfectly cooked steak and sides.  The Wagyu ribeye, asparagus in romesco sauce and cauliflower were amazing.  I would also order the straw fries which I saw several tables around us order :)  We received a complimentary birthday assortment of desserts which was plenty for our table of 5!",

Also really enjoyed the \"ishiyaki\" meat being cooked on a hot stone table side.  Our sommelier was very knowledgeable and made fantastic recommendations.  Truly one of a kind special experience!",

Such an interesting, different menu.  We tried things we've never had before.  It's really indescribable.  We sat near the 'butcher shop' and cooking area.  It was really amazing to see all the different cuts of meat and how they prepared them.  It is very different from how you see other steakhouses.  I loved that every piece of meat was labeled with its origin, including the name of the farm, town, etc. Talk about knowing where your food comes from!  We did a few courses and of course had plenty of meat.  Come hungry!  It was really an amazing experience and I will 100% be back next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "After eating at Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres those Arby's \"we have the meats\" commercials feel slightly less genuine. This wasn't dinner; it was an experience and it ranked in the top 5 meals I've ever enjoyed, right along side the Jose Andres spot in Atlantic City. Both visits to these iconic high-quality establishments have taken places during bachelor parties (first my Best Man's and most recently - mine) and we couldn't have asked for better service, more options, or different company to share with us.  We started with cocktails and some appetizers; the Smoked Aladdin Manhattan (consisting of buffalo trace bourbon, sweet vermouth, lemon aromatic, orange bitters) was perfectly mixed and then followed by a caviar flight, tomato bread, steak tar tare (mixed right in front of us), and Iberico Jamon (for those unitiatiated this is ham from pigs who were locked in a cave with only acorns to eat for three years - not sure why it tastes so good but it's otherworldy).  After we worked our way through the appetizers it was on to the main courses - a suckling pig and then the waygu steak and sides. The pig came out first, followed by the steak and sides about 10 minutes later which originally frustrated us until we learned it was done that way so the table is able to enjoy the selections in an order the chef decides. Similar to the rest of the review (and to avoid being overly repetitive) the entrees and sides were world-class and incredibly delicious - the perfect amount not to feel stuffed but plenty for the entire table to share.  We closed the evening with some tiny reduction-made desert treats from all over the world, followed by an amazing tour of the entire restaurant by the General Manager Mr. Pano Argyriades. We learned about how the Vegas location came to be, the different ways the meats are stored/cooked/served, and the philosophy of Jose Andres  himself.   Perfect end to a perfect evening, I would highly recommend visiting this spot if you have the time and energy while in the city of sin!",

Then we had the foie grais in cotton candy which was ABSURD. We ordered bottles of red white and a few people ordered cocktails, which they were happy with. I stuck with wine. We also got a side with red peppers which came out on a cast iron type looking pan which I liked. When the meat came the waitress served us which was helpful. I thought the special Wagu beef would be amazing but it was whatever. I'd say don't splurge on special steak and just stick to regular steak bc I tried like three different kinds and really couldn't tell the difference. Also if your a steak sauce person, heads up, no sauce!",

The Wagu/Black Angus Rib Steak we had was flavorless to me. They bragged about only using salt and some basic herbs \"to bring out the flavor,\" but I'd say that all it did was make the steak taste like generic beef. No richness of flavor and at $75/person it was way overpriced. The potato au gratin we had were amazing though. All in all, not a place I'd recommend unless you have $$$$ to burn.",

I prefer CUT and Craftsteak because their menus are just easier to navigate. Bazaar Meat is way too overpriced and the menu needs a revamp. Charging by oz. Or lb. for meat is nonsensical for diners. The menu's pretty much been the same for the past 2-3 years. My last visit I ordered a $65 chicken platter and honestly, a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store for $8 would've tasted better. The gazpacho is delicious. The olives are wonderful. The buttery mashed potatoes are terrific. The tartare is great, but the meats are just fair.",

    "text": "Damn. That's all I can say. If you are a carnivore this is your place, don't bring the vegan friends or they will turn into quinoa and fall apart. The menu is meant for sharing, so that's exactly what we did. Went with the wife, so just the two of us, almost did the tasting menu but decided against it. Although it had a huge variety and there were two options, they were $200 or $250 per person depending on the one you got, and we would've ended up with some items we weren't interested in trying (asparagus) and would've had smaller portions of the meat. So we opted instead to go a la carte, and got two foie gras lollipops (get these, don't be thrown off by the cotton candy it works like a glaze), an order of beef carpaccio (pure umami meaty goodness), an order of the iberico ham (it was like the best prosciutto infused with walnuts), the ossetra/malossol/salmon caviar sampler (nice quality, but be careful with the condiments, I'd rec just using a bit of the creme fraiche, skip the onions) and finally the 16oz chateaubriand (literally so tender you could cut it with your fork). Had one side of potatoes (the cheese baked ones, can't remember the name) which were good but not mind blowing like the meat. If you are in a group with more varied tastes I would rec the tasting menu as it will hit the highlights and have something for everyone. If it's just a couple, consider doing what we did, it was about $175 per person (not including drinks of course) and we got exactly what we wanted and were super full. I haven't even gotten to the drinks, they were very creative, the cocktails are unique and varied. The best part was when they brought a wine bucket to keep my bomber of farmhouse beer from Deschutes cool during dinner. Wait staff deserve a shout out, they were super helpful, their timing was impeccable, each dish came one at a time which let you enjoy it at the right temp, and we were never rushed, never had to ask for anything, they were always there. Will post pics, but if you have a special occasion to celebrate you should most definitely go here and see it in person.",

First the good:  - The ambiance and multiple open kitchens is great. - Our waiter was out of this world.  - The sommelier and wine choices were fantastic. - The food for the most part was over the top good. Notably: - Cotton candy foie gras - One of the most creative things I've had in a long time. Keep in mind these are one per order. - Kobe beef sandwiches - too hard to describe as a sandwich these are single bites of heaven. Again, one per order - Sushi - Amazing presentation and just plain good - Chef's selection of cured meats - FAB - Suckling pig - sticker shock starts here, but this is the only restaurant in the U.S. that can serve this and it is WELL worth it. A little surprise is that it is served with a very good salad. - Robuchon whipped potatoes - would you like some potatoes with your butter? Just indulge. Worth it! - Dessert - I won't steal the surprise, but its delightful.  Now to the not so impressive:  - The menus are just too over-the-top. Huge plastic monstrosities that are difficult to hold and just plain awkward. They were obviously trying to make a statement with these, but they are a huge fail.  - The menu is convoluted and confusing. Study before you go or choose one of the pre fixe menu offerings.  - We spent a lot of money on the Mindful Meats beef rib steak and it was NOT cooked. I actually like rare steak but we ordered it medium to please everyone at the table. It came out BLUE. If you don't know what I mean by blue meat, look it up. When we brought it to the waiter's attention, he agreed, but did nothing. This was the biggest fail of the evening.  Overall a great experience, but they've got to get the details down.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Bazaar Meats last Thursday. My decision to go there was because, I read Yelp reviews and most of them seemed very favorable. I have not tried his place in LA or DC, so I was looking forward to this location in LV.  There were three of us, and one a European trained chef that worked in Asia and Hawaii. All of us, were not impressed with the food.   We ordered Jose's Asian Tacos, nori with a slice of Iberico ham and a flying fish roe. This was very simple appetizer, one that did not give me any thrills. Next, we tried Bagel & Lox Cone this also was nothing special. I was still excited about the rest of dishes we ordered. There are four choices of potatoes under \"Potatoes\" category and there is another potato dish under \"Appetizers\". I ordered Papas Canarias, this was the worst potato dish, I have tried. These were, either, boiled, steamed or possibly baked white and purple baby potatoes that were served with two sauces: a red and a green one. I felt like I could be in a very rural area anywhere in the world, where people share what they have at home from the goodness of their heart, not a fancy restaurant. The asparagus was overdone.  Next, we tried \"Beefsteak tomato\" tartare. I wanted to order a steak tartare but after the waiter recommended this meatless version, I thought why not. Once, again this dish did not tantalize my palate.  The only place where I enjoyed an incredible tasting Maui grown tomato with a little dressing was Alan Wong's Amasia. I liked it so much, I ended up going two nights in a row few years back.   Next, we tried Wagyu Beef Cheeks and this was very tasty. Lastly, our orders of A5 Kobe, A5 Wagyu, A5 Wagyu Tenderloin were delivered along with fresh wasabi. These meats proved to be delicious. However, if you have this kind of quality it would be hard not to enjoy the incredible taste. We did not like, however, Bone-in-strip loin grass fed angus, it was very chewy and few times, I had to spit the pieces that I could not consume.  When, my friend asked about their desert menu, we were told that it was a cart that was in a different section of the restaurant at the moment. On the way out, we walked to have a quick look. It was nice and pleasing looking to the eye, but for someone who travelled the world and lived on three continents, it did not give the wow, I want it affect.  In conclusion, I tried Bazaar Meats and satisfied my curiosity but will very unlikely rush to pay a second visit.",

We fell for it and ordered the underwhelming $140 steak- don't to it! We were clearly expecting it to be the best steak we had ever eaten and this was definitely not the case. For starters, it was served cold and secondly it was fine but not at all melt in your mouth fantastic. The ham croquettes and steak tartare were good but not amazing. The tiny desserts were also just fine. We were really let down by this place.",

    "text": "Our quickie at the SLS literally began with a reservation here -- we had not even checked into our room yet! We had tried The Bazaar in West Hollywood and loved it, so when hearing of this one opening up, it was added to our restaurant bucket list.  While briefly waiting at the bar for a seat, I ordered a cocktail that was as marvelous to watch being crafted as to taste: their Aladdin Manhattan \"Smoked\". It actually was mixed within a genie lamp, with a towel on top to keep in the smokiness, then ultimately poured into a glass with a large ball of ice. Mystical.  Onto the food! Once seated, we ordered up a storm. First was their Cotton Candied Fois Gras, actually spot on. I think the idea was to be deceptive, it tastes exactly like (and *IS*) Fois Gras, but may not look like it. Next were their Modern & Traditional Olives -- we'd had these in West Hollywood, too, but their so delicious. Any liquid emulsified version of a green olive that can burst in your mouth wins my vote.  Their Super-Giant Pork Skinned Chicharron was a fun project, to be hammered on the table! Probably was a bit much to eat, and we had more on the way, but absolutely crispy and flavorful.  My favorite item was their Bison Buffalo Style. When each of these thinly sliced portions was rolled up with various cheeses and servings atop it, definite bliss persisted! Might have been blue cheese, could have even used another one, but that it was used sparingly made it just right.  Two items, I thought were just okay. We had their Abalone with Ikura, which may have been tougher to chew than I would have preferred. Did like its mesh with vegetables. The other dish, their Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (grilled octopus) was our second choice -- our first choice would have been the Morcilla with Uni (blood sausage with sea urchin), but it was no longer available that night. The octopus was okay texture-wise, but think they can improve upon paprika or cayenne sprinkles over potatoes. I do love octopus when it hits the right notes.  A bottle of Spanish Rose of Pinot Noir accompanied most of the night, and we topped it with a dessert sampler. Very good start to a grand vaca! At least 4 stars.",

Chris our waiter talked us thru it with passion and attention.  He took my wife's lactose allergy seriously and guarded her like a sheepdog!  We had a perfect Chateaubriand but the highlights of the night were the small plates: a recommended thin-sliced jerky was soft and packed with flavor, Jamon Iberico de Ballota served w/ thin bread and roasted tomatoes and garlic was possibly the tastiest dish I've ever had, bison buffalo style carpaccio was perfect, and their small round roasted potatoes w/ a dipping sauce were also a unique treat.  Going back at very next opportunity to sample more from this amazing menu; we were not even able to sample the seafood parts of the selection!  Fantastic!",

Went with coworkers our first night in Vegas and the server was very helpful and accommodating in helping us select courses that suited everyone's tastes, as it is all family style and many are very large portions.  My favorite was the wagyu beef that was served raw and we quickly seared the slices on hot stones.  Delicious!!  Suckling pig was a close second.  Next time would go lighter on the apps and get one of the huge ribeye steaks to share, also cooked at the table!!",

    "text": "Magical! This place is full of gastronomical delights. The cotton candy foie gras was a perfect example of awesomeness in a bite. Every bite is an adventure in your mouth. The beefsteak tomato tartare tasted deceptively like beef. My husband argued that it was beef tartare. We had to ask our server to mediate the argument. Turns out, they dehydrated the tomatoes to attain that beefy texture. The bison carpaccio was exceptional. We ordered the tasting menu and we're very satisfied. The rib eye was dry aged and so flavorful. I can't believe how sinfully delicious the mashed potatoes were. Everything was just so elevated and unlike anything you're ever tasted. The service was amazing and so attentive but the hostess needed a customer service training. We arrived 5 minutes early and waited by the bar for 15 minutes. She seated everyone after we came in so we inquired about our reservation. She forgot about us and didn't even apologize. Rude! I'm definitely coming back and telling friends about it. It's now my go-to restaurant in Vegas.",

    "text": "First off the service was amazing.  Our waiter, Eric, was an all around star.  Most of the food was great, just way over priced and the portions were too small for the amount.  160 for a fourth of a suckling pig and a bit of salad.  Then a 2 pound bone in rib eye, for 200.  The meat was great but i felt peter lugers is better.  The omelette was perfect.  The croquettes were not cooked all the way through, the lox and bagel cones sucked.  The augratin potatoes were good.  The salted caramel ice cream was amazing but the waffle thing sucked.  then they try to compensate with a bunch of little costco free deserts.  No free bread or table something.  the next night i went to andiamos and had better food, more of it, and for half the price.  sorry but 300 dollars extra for the celebrity chef name is not worth it if the food does not match the hype.  Spent 650 no drinks.  Good place to go if you have an expense account and can order with impunity.",

    "text": "Solid meal, but disappointed by the server's recommendations. Overall, lots of gimmicks and some of the dishes were pretty good.   Best dishes of the night (in order):  1/4 Suckling Pig - tender with extra crispy skin. ** Reuben w/ air bread - tastiest appetizer of the night, similar to the philly cheese @ SLS Beverly Hills Roasted Cauliflower Steak - super delicious, good flavor. Jamon Iberico de Bellota - high quality cuts, has a subtle nutty flavor.  The Classic Beef Sirloin Tartare - made fresh at the table, solid. * Robouchon Mashed Potatoes - just tastes like butter. * Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Beef Rib Steak ** - well cooked medium rare. (read details below)  Disappointing: Cotton Candy Foie Gras - like a lollipop, worth a try if you're a foie lover.  Smoke and Ice Fresh (raw) Oysters* - tastes exactly like how it sounds.  Wagyu Beef Cheeks - too gamey and fatty. Piquillo Peppers - too saucey. Brussels Sprouts w/ lemon air - just OK.  *The server recommended that we needed two of the mashed potatoes and tartare - total upsell and we had leftovers of both. **The server told us our meal was \"light\" and that we absolutely 2 quarter lb. suckling pigs and also a steak (that needed to be ordered at the beginning of the meal because it takes 50 minutes to prepare). We reluctantly ordered the steak in addition to our quarter lb. suckling pig... and it was TOO MUCH FOOD. We knew the steak price per lb and were led to believe that 1 order would be a little over a pound. Instead, we got a 3 lb steak when we were already full. Must've been because of the built in 18% service charge/gratuity...  We left overstuffed and uncomfortable. Not return-worthy.",

Pork Skins they crack/break in front of you. They were just that, plain pork skins with a yogurt dipping sauce.  Croquetas which is like a stuffed mozzarella stick. They offer it as chicken or ham with cheese. It was interesting, unique but probably wouldn't order it again.  Sloppy Joe actually tastes really good but was like warm. It comes on a grilled bun topped with shoestring fries. The meat tasted like it was pre-cooked and simply on the side until ordered. The 'plate' was warmer than the food.  My husband had the octopus and he loved it. Entries.... My husband and I both had steak (different ones can't remember the names) but even though I ordered my mine well done it arrived well but the garnish was sea salt. The salt was so heavy it felt like I was chewing on salt. ($50 steak arrived on a chipped 'rustic' plate) The waitress offered to have the chef take the salt off but I declined and proceeded to scrap the salt off. The meat itself (two bites) was like chewing on fat through out.  The grilled Asparagus tasted like I was eating burnt/charred asparagus.  The mashed potatoes were really rich and smooth but VERY salty.  Desserts..... There was a tray of desserts to choose from, I tasted each but was not impressed with any of them. The S'mores was chocolate covered marshmallow atop a graham cracker, the coconut was like a puree really creamy, key lime cheesecake, pineapple cheesecake the pineapple acted like a sauce, edible wrapper candy looked like fudge (didn't taste). Many more I don't know the name. The general manager was very apologetics day very kind but I wasn't impressed by ANY of the food.",

We ordered a dried-aged, bone-in ribeye cut from a 7-year-old animal: the flavor was sublime; not something you would ever experience from a younger cattle. A hundred buck steak that was completely worth it.   The appetizers are creatively designed and skillfully prepared. Cotton candy went perfectly with the tiny piece of foie gras. The consomme is seriously the best I ever have anywhere bar none. Won't recommend the foie-waffle, though.   The truly pleasant surprise was the dessert. We ordered the great-value, random Chef Selection and were blessed with ten pieces of expertly executed French desserts including innovative bonbons and cakes each with its own unique character and surprises. Didn't expect to find one of best chocolate bonbons I ever have in a \"meat bazaar\".   Our host, Eric, was simply awesome. The service experience we received here was a perfect balance between casualness and professionalism.   I highly recommend this place. There were unique and innovative food executed with traditional culinary mastery to be had here. More than worth the cost and the trip.",

Once you pass the grand entrance, drama abounds as you're invited into a dimly lit space that's very much like the Bazaar in Los Angeles with interesting chachkes baubles and distinctive chandeliers of various shapes and sizes.     While our table was being prepared, we opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few fascinating cocktails crafted by the bartender.   Moments later, we were escorted to our table where our server Nick introduced himself.  Nick was warm friendly and offered some thoughtful suggestions from the menu. On that note, I'd have to say my experience was elevated to VIP status because he was quite the accomplished server. He was very attentive and made every effort to check with us throughout the evening and ensured our experience was nothing less than top notch.   Foie Gras Cotton Candy - A classic at The Bazaar that is not to be missed, especially since it's been banned practically everywhere else!  Bagel & Lox Plump salmon roe served with soft cream cheese in a light and crispy cone. Briny yet smooth and creamy with a crunchy finish, phenomenal!  Grissini Wagyu Beef Carpaccio -  Fragrant onion infused breadsticks wrapped with thinly sliced wagyu beef that's so insanely soft & tender, it will virtually melt in your mouth.  Served with a decadently rich and flavorful Parmesan espuma dip, your mouth will be savoring the rich permeating flavors long after you've devoured every morsel of this fantastic dish.  King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail -  Served chilled on a bed of ice, I quickly noticed generous portions of chunk king crab & plump shrimp bathing in a bright red cocktail sauce. My mouth quickly started to water and once I took a bite, my eyes lit up. Bright acidity from the sauce coupled with the fresh juicy and plump king crab meat & shrimp made for a light and refreshing cocktail that was refreshingly substantial down to the very last bite.  Oysters  Kushi, Shiboku, Blue Point -  Fresh, briny, perfectly sized with a plump and juicy mouthfeel and went down the hatch beautifully.  Foie Gras floating island -  Served in a small tea cup, this flavorful dish was far from dainty. It was actually quite rich and velvety smooth with a spectacular nutty finish. Foie gras lovers will revel in this richly satisfying dish.  Robuchon Potatoes -  With the signature Robuchon name stamped on these potatoes, I was confident I was in for a treat but words simply can not describe the out of body experience that you'll have when you try these amazing mashed potatoes. Buttery smooth and decadently rich. Simply divine.   Roasted Corn -  Don't let the diminutive size fool you, these snappy little guys don't only pack an irresistible crunch but a surprisingly spicy kick, as well!   Skirt Steak -  A beautifully cooked steak with a perfectly pink tender and juicy flesh.  Kobe -  Easily the best cut of steak ive ever had. Buttery, juicy, fatty, tender and infinitely satisfying. You'll literally shed a tear of joy when you enjoy this outstanding cut of premium beef. And trust, this beef is legit! They even prove it with an actual certificate of authenticity that's handed to you at the end of your meal! Now that's rich ;)  We ended our meal with a selection of the restaurant's fine desserts presented in a beautiful red pastry box.   I'd have to say this was one of my better dining experiences in Vegas and much of it came from the wonderful service and of course, inspiring cuisine!  Happy Eats!",

We got to the restaurant 15 minutes before his shift started but we waited.  Chicharron: Freshly cooked pork skin...so hot and fresh you can still here the fat sizzle.  Served with a yogurt dipping sauce on parchment paper and they break up the big chicharron into shareable pieces using a mallet. 5/5  Jamon Croquetas: Hot breded and fried balls of savory jamon. 4/5  Croquetas de Pollo: Served in a glass tennis shoe with a shoelace on even. Hot breaded and fried potatoes with chicken inside. 4/5  Caipiranha: They bring a cart and you watch as liquid nitrogen quickly turns caipiranha into a slushy treat. 4.5/5  Seta Al Ajillo: A nice side of mushrooms with garlic. I love garlic. 4/5  Robuchon: Super buttery mashed potatoes similar to Joel Robuchon's, hence, the name. 5/5  Beef Rib Steak: 2lbs of steak that's tender, flavorful and juicy. They already slice it up into strips for you. 4.5/5  We tried a few desserts: Chocolate Dome, Passion Fruit, Mango and Banana Tart, and Cream Puffs (in dark chocolate and olive oil, and chocolate and hazelnut).  It's hard for me to get excited over cream puffs but these were very good.  Eddie was our server and was amazing as usual.  He made a few recommendations. The restaurant itself is quirky. Deer and bull heads, animals with sunglasses on on the back of chairs.",

    "text": "This place was awesome. It can be pricy so be sure to bring your appetite and credit card.  We decided to take a part of the Summer Tasting Special 2015. For $65 you received a series of different menu items. We felt that this was a great deal and the cheapest deal we would find here so we decided to check it out.  If you wanted more tastings or some of their higher quality meats you can get different priced tasting menus including $150, $200 and $250. This was out of our price range and we stuck with the Summer Special.   On this menu you were able to get a variety of things including olives, cream cheese and lox, fried pig skin with greek yogurt, beef tenderloin, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and raw beef swirled on a garlic stick. The mashed potatoes were awesome because they were swirled in butter and the asparagus was really good as well. I can't pick a favorite because everything was so good in its own respect.   In addition to the Summer Special menu items we added on the lamb and the fried oysters. I'm so glad we added on the oysters. They were awesome and cooked with butter. In my opinion anything soaked in butter is awesome in my book. The lamb was good but when served with the tenderloin it quickly made me very full.  The service here was good. At one point while setting out the steak silverware they accidentally dropped the knife on my friends water glass and it shattered. They apologized and quickly cleaned it up. I was kind of surprised for being so high end that they didn't comp something on our meal or do something to show they were sorry. Maybe if we were an older crowd they might have. I would have least thought our waiter to come and check on us after this happened and he didn't. Because of this the place received 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that great meal.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant experience of all time. Presentation and craft of all of the cocktails and food dishes was exceptional. With a modern twist to the ingredients and a True flair and artistry of the chef's presentations, in not sure there's a better place in Las Vegas to recommend for a meal.   Bazaar Meat is located in SLS so maybe that's why it doesn't get as much credit as it should. Still it's a Jose Andres restaurant so you know it will be good. The venue is humongous and could easily host a convention.  Took about 3 minutes just to walk to our table.  The waitress came out right away, gave us a handful of menus, explained the cocktails and course options, and we were off.   We began with a few choice cocktails from the menu. These were exceptional and each had its own uniqueness, whether it be salt air on the margarita or a smokey flavor on the Manhattan. We also tried the liquid nitrogen lemon drink, a super strong and tasty old fashioned, and a literally smoking mojito.   We went with the $100 tasting menu and swapped out the olives for the foie grad cotton candy at no extra charge. Each meal came out with an explanation on how to properly eat/experience each dish. Most came with a signature dipping sauce as well. We were able to pace ourselves with the delivery of the food so we were definitely not rushed.  Our two and a half hour meal was full of 8 dishes with our added few side dishes. Each was delectable, with the standouts being the foie gras cotton candy, bread stick beef carpaccio, brussel sprouts, and a light meat dish with a signature truffle sauce. We ended with a platter of about 8 desserts. Each had a unique element like the food, including edible packaging for a candy as the top. Main meal was the better than desserts in my opinion, though that's not knocking the dessert.   Bazaar Meat is my number one recommendation in Las Vegas as of this date. For a memorable meal from start to finish, come here and experience not just eat the food",

Every item we ordered was a taste experience.  Its always great when you can tell how much though went in to bringing the flavors together in a dish.  From the live scallops, to the foie gras cotton candy, to the steak tartare the flavors were wonderful.  Then came the steak... which quickly shot up my list of favorite steaks.  The slow cook created a wonderful char yet the steak itself melted in our mouths.  A truly wonderful experience.    But, what makes a great dinner experience complete is great service.  Nick Weaver was excellent.  He took time to explain the menu and help us create our memorable dinner experience.  Nick was attentive and even more, we left that night feelling like we had a new friend.  Thank you Nick for everything.  We can't wait to come back.  The rest of the Bazaar Meat team was great as well.  Christopher Bugeya  (Assistant GM) was just as attentive as Nick.  And everyone else who came by the table to help made us feel really special.  Jose Andres has a lot to be proud of with the restaurant.  It is great experience, and we cannot wait to come back.  Thank you all.",

They are located at the SLS Hotel, right off the Strip, so we were excited to check it out. I am primarily vegetarian so I thought this would be a great place to experience, because a family member works there and told me that I would love the food, even if I don't eat meat. The restaurants open kitchen has several huge Josper ovens with open-style fire pits in the middle of the room. They offer very exclusive steaks (and seafood) from the best sustainable sources from all around the world. We were greeted immediately by the hostess, and seated near the ovens, so we could watch the entire process of the kitchen. We were told the special of the day and offered a sample of the evening's wine spotlight. The table was set properly and everything (and everyone) was dressed perfectly. Our Waiter, Chris Rosen, introduced himself and offered a special drink to my 10-year old Granddaughter, and she loved it! Everyone was so proper and friendly and accommodating. I was shown all the vegetable-based dishes and they offered to make a special entree of all the roasted house vegetables with the famous Chef Robuchon Mashed Potatoes. The interior of the restaurant is eclectic and very unique. Stuffed alligators and Matador-esque themed decor, including the infamous bullhead on the wall, with tapestries of a kind of Spanish-feel vintage theme. The place is huge and laid out in several areas for VIP's in the back, as well as a bar-lounge in the front for impromptu drinks or small diners. The entry is open to the glass coolers holding all the suckling pig, whole fish and enormous amounts of priceless Kobe beef from Spain and Japan. Some pieces of meat were hundreds of dollars and were made fresh to order per your specifications. The other diners were all dressed nicely and everyone seemed like they were enjoying themselves. Lots of noise and conversations filled the massive room. The whole place smelled of a fire-pit, the atmosphere with low lighting and amazing animals decorating the entire place. Chandeliers adorned overhead and unusual lighting fixtures were everywhere. Our food was amazing to say the least, and my plate of fire-roasted vegetables with a white yogurt sauce was just perfect. They brought us out several other options of beefsteak tomato tartare, roasted asparagus-cauliflower and then this amazing cactus tartare. This actually turned out to be one of my total favorites! and of course, pan de cristal (spanish bread) for everyone. I would highly recommend Bazaar Meats for the total Spanish-Bazaar immersion both for the experience and the incredible quality of the food. The staff was immensely professional and the evening was so fun. We cannot wait to go back!!! Well done Chef Alex!",

A station for cured meats.  A fresh seafood station and a regular kitchen.  Service was very attentive and helpful, highlighting the restaurant favorites.  Every dish is well flavored and masterfully complimenting each other.    Cotton candy foie gras- unbelievable!  Sweetness of the light puffed sugar, mildly cuts into the deep rich flavor of the foie gras, making this so wonderful.  Kushi Oysters - fresh briny flavor, accompanied with a classic cocktail, a vinegar based and finally Jose's special sauce (SOOOO GOOD)  King crab/shimp cocktail- its topped with a salsa like sauce that is really good.  NIce big morsels of king crab meat and shrimp.  Uni w/ginger - fresh rich creamy   Flat Iron Washugyu from Oregon - good but compared to the Japanese kobe .....not even close.  4oz kobe rib eye. - I love how it is cut into a long 2in cube.  This way all four sides gets well seasoned.  Its literally like biting into a cut of tofu with this unreal beef flavor.  One of the bests Ive ever tasted.  Sorbets/ice creams and little bites - nice refreshing end to a magnificent meal.  Jose Andres is one of my favorite chefs, so to have another one of his restaurants in LV is so awesome.  This seems to be the culinary hotspot right now as it was packed full the night we went.  Saw Rick from Pawn stars dining in the private dining room!",

    "text": "Had a great experience here last night celebrating my cousin's bachelorette. Wanted to say kudos to the folks working here for being incredibly customer service oriented and genuinely nice.   Often times when you step into an expensive restaurant you feel uncomfortable because the people working there are professional but not warm. Sometimes they even make you feel bad if you don't seem like a high roller or are not a culinary connoisseur.  This was the total opposite. Bazaar Meat combines eclectic class, delicious food, and top notch customer service. Everyone we spoke to was beyond nice and approachable. Our waiter spontaneously volunteered to give us a mini tour and explanation of meats at the counter. He was totally cool with us not doing the prefix and was genuinely helpful in helping us choose the right portions/orders for our table. The chef sent us a complimentary and super delicious tartar when we were waiting for our meat and super hungry. When an incident occurred where a server accidentally spilled some meat sauce on my cousin's dress the entire staff immediately stepped up to the plate. Everyone apologized profusely and the manager came over and gave my cousin his personal card/number and said he would take care of dry cleaning for her and do the pickup door to door. After a really satisfying and filling meal (glad we trusted our waiter on the portions), they brought around a complimentary desserts cart and told us to get whatever we wanted. I thought I misheard at first. It was like being a kid at a candy shop. Our desserts server was incredibly patient when we were overwhelmed by the options and she was happy to reexplain what they were and added even more desserts than we asked for (I think she sensed we were being conservative out of politeness). When we left to go and had our remaining desserts boxed - it came back with even more! When the check came they removed the 25% service fee because of the incident.   I can't say enough good things about the team working there. The food was really good and probably what most people write about but I think it's the entire experience that makes the meal especially when it is a special occasion. Thanks again Bazaar Meat for making this a wonderful experience.   If you are in Vegas, it's totally worth a trip past the hustle and bustle to the end of the strip!",

    "text": "My 2nd time and it was a meat festival for tablet of 3. I preordered the quarter Suckling pig ($140)  which was about 1.5 lb cooked in Spanish style and roasted in the charcoal/brick oven. Usually, it would take about an 1hour for the dish to be prepared. The waiter presented the quarter portion uncut for presentation, then it was brought to the back to be cut in smaller pieces. Part of the pig was quite fatty, but there were leaner parts which was sooo tender. The smoky flavor and the tenderness of the meat was awesome! Forget the kalua pig, this is wayyy better. Depending which part you consume, some parts of the skin was very crispy and otherwise was bit soft.   The Spanish style ribeye was worth it. We ordered the Mishima black wagyu which was $65/lb. Generally the minimum weigh of most steak is about 2lb and you can actually pick your own cut by the butcher's table.  It was done medium rare with a smoky and toasty flavor. It was one of the better steaks. By the way, the spanish style rib eye would take about 1 hour to prepare.   We ordered the usual: classic beef tartare and cotton candy foie gras.   Dessert was quite interesting. We ordered the homemade ice cream ($16) which was vanilla. It was presented with 3 wine glass (each had vanilla bean, brandy, and coffee bean). EVery time you take a bite of the ice cream, then you sniff the wine glass with goodies. Eventually every time you take a bite of the ice cream, the taste of ice cream will change.  Not quite sure if i really taste anything different, but its the thought that counts. Dont forget to finish the brandy.  The waitress was extremely attentive and the dishes were well-timed. We informed her that we had to catch a concert and the food came out promptly.",

Always creative, bold, and always a journey. The highlights of the evening include perfectly executed suckling pig and mashed potatoes. Service was flawless. The only caveat is if you don't eat meat, this is not the place for you. If you love amazing food and culinary journeys that will make you long for more, this is your place!",

    "text": "First, I am a little biased.  I am a huge Jose Andres fan.... from the first time I had Patatas Bravas at Jaleo, I was hooked.  Anytime he opens a new place, it's the first thing on my list if I am in town.  Went with colleagues for dinner last week at Bazaar Meat and was thrilled with our booth directly in front of the open pit.  It was a cool, crackling ambiance through the evening.  We were then greeted by our server, Eric, and from the moment he arrived, he was the coolest, ever!  He was attentive and kind, personable, and called me beautiful all night....so that couldn't hurt.  It was authentic, and not in the least creepy in any way.  We began our meal with a few appetizers: Giant Chicharron, Piquillo Peppers \"Julian de Tolosa\", and of course the Patatas Bravas! All items were delicious.  The presentation of each was modern and generous.  The Chicharron were served with a yogurt sauce, but you have to ask for the hot sauce, made in house, that really sends these into the stratosphere.  While my companions were lured by the Wagyu steaks by the ounce, I went smaller with the Wagyu beef cheeks.  It was a sous vide pair, seared gently and served with mojo rojo and oranges.  I will say, it was good, but the bone in rib eye my friends ordered looked delicious.  Sides to die for were the Delmonicos and the Carrots.  Along the way, we were treated to a series of seemingly never-ending delights from the kitchen, on the house.  We had the most delicious carpaccio I have ever had, dish of the lightest, puffed croquettes with jamon and bechamel sauce and a few other things that swirled around the table in a delicious fog.  What a lovely evening we had.  Thanks so much for such a great memory!",

    "text": "My wife and I visited Bazaar Meat back in April with a large group of friends.  It was probably our favorite culinary experience to date.  Prior to coming to Bazaar Meat, we were expecting it to be a high end, traditional, steakhouse.  Wow, we should have done our homework.    Luckily one of our friends had been to Bazaar previously and told our server to feed us like Jose would feed us.  I wish I could remember our server's name (looked like Leonardo DiCaprio).  He was awesome and, OH, did he feed us!?  For starters, we had the super-giant pork-skin chicharron (really cool), patatas bravas, croquetas de pollo, sloppy joes, and pa'amb tomaquet.  I think I forgot something...    The next course consisted of the chef's selection of cured meats, antlers filled with Kobe beef jerky, and king crab & shrimp cocktail.  I KNOW I'm forgetting something on this course...  The main event was ridiculous.  First we were served Kobe beef short ribs.  The short ribs were served \"on\" the bone but sliced and prepared for sharing.  These beef short ribs tasted like no beef short rib I've eaten previously.  They were really tender, juicy, and flavorful.  Next out was the Washugyu/Angus bone-in ribeye, while the A5 Kobe was being prepared tableside on hot stones.  The ribeye was perfectly prepared to our liking (medium-rare) and nicely served on the bone like the short rib.  The meat was fork tender, juicy, and delicious.  The Kobe was equally delicious.  I've never eaten different types of beef in one sitting, that I can recall, and thought it was neat to experience the different flavor profiles of the meat simultaneously.  It was SO good.  Oh, I almost forgot the sides, although I can only remember a couple... grilled asparagus and the buttered potato puree.  IF YOU DON'T READ ANY OTHER PORTION OF THIS REVIEW, READ THIS - THE BUTTERED POTATO PUREE IS THE EFFING BOMB...period.  THE best potato dish I've ever eaten or will ever eat.  I would visit Bazaar Meats again, JUST for the potato puree.  Not lying.  Dessert consisted of assorted tarts and small cakes.  It was probably the least desirable portion of our meal.  It was still very good but was pale in comparison to the appetizers and the main course(s).  I'd highly recommend Bazaar Meat by Jose Andreas.  It is much more than a meal, it's an unforgettable experience.",

Our server Tony was incredible and knowledgeable without being pushy or overbearing.   The crispy pork chicharron was absolutely a fun and delicious experience. The Greek yogurt that they serve with it balanced nicely. The table side smashing into pieces was fun.   You have to get the iberico ham. It's $70 but it is worth every single penny. I'm talking melt in your mouth buttery deliciousness. Our server recommended the pan de cristal to go with it and it is the best advice I have ever taken. It is topped with delicious smashed tomatoes. The crust was perfectly toasted and the inside bread was deliciously moist with the tomatoes on top.   The braised beef cheeks were the star of this show. The most tender meat I have ever had. No knife necessary. The oranges put me off at first but brought a welcomed sweetness that balances perfectly with the sauce.   Save room for dessert there was an awesome chef selection box featuring a variety of small items, but we were just too full to partake and chose to have two of the selections that were a perfect way to end our meal.   We were so completely over the top impressed with every aspect of our experience. The staff is welcoming and friendly, not uppety like some fine dining service. The atmosphere is cool and relaxed as you can watch everything be made in front of your eyes with the extensive open kitchen. This is our new go-to spot and we will definitely be back very soon.",

This experience was disappointing and the food was also a bit of a miss for the price point.    Why....because, the reservation was made 4-6 weeks in advance and when we arrived we were taken to a remote part back end of the restaurant to a lonely table.  When we asked for something more in the center of the Dining Room we were told we would need to \"wait til a table was available\".....as we pointed out several tables she then did seat us in one that was empty.  We then watched as 3-4 other parties refused that same lonely table in the back!  HINT:  Might want to rethink the feeling of that part of your establishment!  Food was OK....nothing super special expect a VERY special price point.  I'm totally prepared for the price point....IF you offer stellar service with exceptional food.  No more Bazaar for me...Thanks!",

    "text": "My first time at this restaurant, and I came here for the Thanksgiving prix fixe menu. It's always interesting how European chefs interpret the Thanksgiving turkey dinner. The chef made sure that the turkey white meat was accompanied by crispy skin, dark meat, and enough of the protein so that there were some leftovers that you can take home. The restaurant made sure to add a little tapas flair by mixing in some turkey croquettes (tasty but a bit salty) and their usual Ferran Adria olives (ok). The turkey accompaniment of green beans (good, it even had fried shallots in it instead of onions), cornbread stuffing (this was a miss), Delmonico potatoes (a very good starch), endive salad, cranberry sauce (very good), and crab/shrimp cocktail. The desserts were an autumn themed panna cotta, pumpkin tart, pecan \"cookie\", and a hazelnut bonbon - all just bite size but very delicious.  As other diners have pointed out, the staff is very attentive, but it seemed that the kitchen struggles to provide dishes in a timely and orderly manner. Since this prix fixe is not their standard item, there seemed to be mistiming on when a dish was ready. The croquettes came out immediately. Then an awkward pause until the olives and the crab/shrimp cocktail came. The busboy took away our starter dishes. Again a long awkward pause. Then hot dinner plates were brought out. I assumed that the main course was going to be brought out imminently. Nope. The dinner plates cooled down to lukewarm, and the wait staff brought over the sides of green beans, salad, and cranberry sauce. Another pause, and finally the turkey, potatoes, and the stuffing made an appearance.  Lastly, this is Vegas. Diners and tourists are all there to have fun. The manager came out to ask how the dining experience was. He was making small talk, but then he made a faux pas of asking a tableful of women if there were 3 generations at the table. Um, no. Maybe if there was better lighting you wouldn't have insinuated that some of the women looked older than their age. Even if the woman looked like a grandma, I highly recommend not addressing any woman's age ever in the future! Other than the awkward order of food presentation and social faux pas of the manager, it's a nice restaurant.",

    "text": "So we went to Bazaar Meats at the SLS for my friend's birthday party.  The service was great.  The ambiance was real nice.  The menus though had to make me laugh.  They attached a two pieces of paper to this large plastic board.  I mean it was huge!  It was around 5 pounds, quite ridiculous.  Anyway we ordered a bunch of food.  I really liked Jose's Asian Taco.  It had Jamon Iberico, Nori, and Tobiko.  It worked really nice together.  The nori mellowed out the tobiko and meat.  I would definitely order it again.  Next we got the Foie Gras Cotton Candy.  This was one of the best things I ate on our trip.  A piece of Foie Gras was hidden inside the cotton candy.  You had to eat this in one bite.  As the cotton candy melted, you eventually got one large bite of the liver.  It was amazing!  We then got the opportunity to eat the Jamon Iberico de Bellota (Fermin, Salamanca, Spain) - Hand-cut from the famous black-footed Spanish pig, acorn-fed, free-range.  This is supposed to be one of the best meats in the world.  And I have to say it is.  The meat melted in our mouths.  IT had so many layers of flavor.  I could taste the salt, the earthy-ness, the acorns, that they feed it.  It was magnificent.  Just a quick warning, it is pricey and you don't get a lot of meat.  So we ordered around 3 orders.  The Roast Suckling Pig was amazing.  The skin cracked in our mouths.  The pig was moist, tender, and full of great flavor.    We also ordered the Beef Rib Steak from Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus.  The steak was tender and had really good flavor, but it was severely under-seasoned.  I prefer the 6 month Prime Riserva Steak from Carenevino.  We also had the Brussel Sprouts and Robuchon Potatoes with White Alba Truffles.  The Sprouts was nothing spectacular.  But the potatoes, drenched in butter and truffles were amazing.   Overall this was a really good meal, but it was suite expensive.  I think the price point is a little too high for what you get.",

    "text": "Wow! Amazing experience. We went for the middle option for the tasting menus which provided a great variety of items and ends on the meat of your choice. We got the rosewood ribeye which was an excellent steak. In total we had 16 different courses before the steak but the steak was the highlight. This is what makes a restaurant unique and why you come to Las Vegas. It's an over the top experience. The service was amazing. John and Panos took care of us. We even got a tour of the restaurant which was cool. Highly recommend eating here. We will be back next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place is on the top list of places that we went to for dinner.  This place is outstanding!  It is so hard to explain in words, but it is a must try!  The menu is setup up as serving tapas, so keep that in mind as you pick items off the menu.  Being setup as tapas, it can add up in a hurry, so this place can become quite pricey by wanting to try too many items.    For starters, we had the Reuben and the Simple Tomato Salad.  The Reuben was really small and you only had like 3 small bites to it, but it did taste great.  Don't just get that for a starter, because it makes horsderves look huge.   The tomato salad was very good.  It had at least 6 different types of tomatoes in a Balsamic vinegar glaze.    Then we got the Classic Tartares as an appetizer.  This was actually made for you at your table.  I personally never had Tartares before, but I must admit it was worth trying.    For dinner, we had the Chateaubriand, Tenderloin with Robuchon mashed potatoes that were truly buttery heaven.  I highly recommend both f these items for dinner.  If I could give this place 6 stars I would.  You must put this place on your bucket list while visiting Vegas. You will not be disappointed.   It is a all-around great place to try for any occasion.",

    "text": "I read an article from Food Republic published October 22, 2014 called \"The Vegas Beef Battle\", which said that the Wagyushu beef rib steak served at Bazaar Meat from a ranch in Lindsay, Oregon was some sort of unique hybrid super steak that combined the marbling of Japanese beef with flavor of Midwestern corn-fed beef. That sounds impressive, but don't believe the hype.  First off, credit where credit is due - this is an impressive space. The interior of Bazaar Meat is certainly a sight to behold, with the glass cases housing delectable looking cuts of meat.   And I had no problem with the appetizers. I ordered the morcilla and uni. The morcilla was softer than expected. Like really soft. The uni was good, but it was pretty much like regular uni except with a miso glaze. This dish also had slight sprinkling of miniature salt crystals inside.  But as for the main event, well, this left a lot to be desired. First off, it took quite a while for the steak to be brought out, perhaps 45 min plus. I was seated shortly after 10pm but I didn't receive my entree until 11pm. The temperature was lower than I was expecting, and there was no sizzle. The waiter Eric explained that's how they do it - they let it rest for a bit in order to keep juices in. I have never heard of this practice before, but whatever. The flavor was good, but overall it wasn't as good as the Japanese Wagyu I had at Cut in the Venetian. I found that this beef was not really that much different than a good ribeye in NYC. It was maybe a little bit softer, but the marbling was not nearly as extensive as I expected and the steak didn't softly acquiesce and melt in my mouth like True 100% Japanese-imported Wagyu does. If this was the best steak in the house, consider me unimpressed. Go to Cut or SW instead.  The nail in the coffin was that the steak was much more expensive than I thought. The menu said $95 per lb., so I thought I was getting a 16 oz cut. But when the check came it said 2.25 lbs., which was not made clear to me at the outset. I find this very deceptive. Then the waiter mispronounced my name at the end. I can't see myself coming back here - at least not on my dime - because the value just isn't there.",

We ordered a lot of items, rated below:  - Suckling Pig (4.5 stars): This is what they are known for, and it is a completely unique dish; unlike any pork I've ever had.  The outer skin is crisp and caramelized, and underneath this thin veneer is a layer of fatty, tender, flavorful meat.  Two of our group loved it, one thought it was a bit too fatty.  - Carpaccio on a stick - (5+ stars): The highlight of the evening for two of our party and loved by all of us.  Absolutely amazing warm dipping foam sauce.  Please order this.  We were all fighting over the last one.  - Classic Beef Tartare: (5+ stars): the favorite dish of one of our party, it is outstanding.  Diced cubes of beef tartare, egg yolk, spice, mustard.  Amazing!  - Cotton Candy Foie Gras (4 stars): Loved by two of our group, one thought it was okay.  Sweet Foie gras surrounded by cotton candy.  - Chicken Croquettes (4.5 stars): Delicious, warm, great for sharing, enjoyed by all  - Pillin Peppers (4 stars): flavorful and spicy, served flat in marinade, enjoyed by all, one said just good not great  - Cauliflower (4 stars): Delicious, aromatic, roasted cauliflower in a pine nut reduction.  Awesome  - Roubuchon Potatoes (4.5 stars): one of our party said they were the best he's ever had.  Everyone enjoyed, one commented that there wasn't much flavor, just perfectly executed potatoes.  -",

    "text": "Came here for a valentine's day dinner with Justin B. and even though we had a late 9:30pm reservation, the place was still fairly crowded. located inside the SLS, the restaurant looks really cool but it is a bit out of the way of the main Strip area. its a pretty cheap taxi ride (about $10ish from the mirage) but just beware of the traffic on the strip if you're trying to make it on time for a reservation.  we started out with a few starters - cotton candy foie gras was good but not sure if it lives up to the hype that i've heard about this dish. croquetas de pollo was a fave, good fried crisp and warm inside haha. beef carpaccio on a stick was good and quite light and refreshing actually. my fave starter we ordered was the chicharron. its a pretty large portion and they smash it up for you right on the table. it was light, crisp and really good flavor. for our main entree, we had to try the suckling pig ($140 for a quarter) and it was really good! the crunch on the skin was amazing! the pork was really tender and it was way more than enough food for the 2 of us. we also ordered a potato pancake side dish that was just whatever and probably not needed haha. by the end of the meal we were left really satisfied and full.  service was fairly good for the most part too. i felt like our server was really knowledgeable about the menu and he gave us some great recommendations, but toward the end of the meal, service stalled a bit. we had to wait quite a bit for our main entree and couldnt seem to find anyone to get us our bill for a while. other than that glitch, this was a really nice special occasion dinner.",

I didn't realize that the beef rib steak, expertly prepared, would take almost an hour to serve. I was so entranced by the menu I vaguely recall my fantastic server going over it, but we had three small plates: croquetas de jamon, patatas bravas, and sloppy joes to tide us over. All were good, but it was all about the steak. The wagyu steak was almost 2.5 lbs and was the most juicy, smoky, meaty deliciousness I've ever had. We ended up taking a good portion of the steak home. Next time, I would order 2 small plates and be more prepared for the wait because it was worth it.",

    "text": "I usually don't give five star reviews for restaurants that I have only been once.   A dinner might seem better than it really is or, more likely, a restaurant may not be able to consistently produce great food.    I think Bazaar Meat is a clear exception for a couple of reasons.  First, the ingredients and preparation were so amazing, that it seems impossible that the quality could suffer by repeat visits.  Second, the price and location are so restrictive, that I probably won't be going back any time soon.   The experience then:  The restaurant is grand.  It sits at the back of the SLS hotel in Las Vegas and seems to cover half the building.  There are apparently five different \"markets\" or stations that prepare each different type of food.  The central \"market\" is the meat section and has awesome wood fired grills that, it's safe to say, would be the envy of any grillmaster anywhere.  The dining room is long and sparely filled with tables, where you feel that you are in an exclusive setting, even when the restaurant is full.  Service was also incredible, with our waiter enthusiastically describing each of our dishes, maintaining that thin line between being a professional and being wonderfully friendly.  The food... oh the Food!!!:  We ordered Jose's Way, a seven course tasting menu with all the best known plates.    First course:   foie gras cotton candy.  The only plate I'd had before, at the Bazaar in Los Angeles.  I think the sweetness of the sugar and the richness of the foie gras goes very well.  But it is hard to take the large portion as \"one bite\" as you are encouraged to do and doing so really pushes the sugar of the cotton candy, overpowering the foie gras.  Second course: Olives classic and modern.  The olives have a wonderful taste and the two competing styles are definitely an interesting change in textures.  Really nice small bite.  Third course:  Caviar taster with creme fraiche in a small wafer cone.  I am not sure of the type of caviar, but this was absolutely amazing.  As I told the wife when she was hesitant to try it, there was no brininess or \"fishy\" taste to the caviar and the richness of the craime freche balanced the saltiness perfectly.  What a bite!  Fourth Course:  Smoked raw oysters.  The presentation is incredible, with a glass bowl covering the oyster plates holding the wood smoke inside.  The smoke comes out and smells wonderful.  The oysters are sweet and smoky.  I don't think I've ever had a better oyster.    Fifth Course: Tartares.  We were given both the classic taratare in a parker roll and the beefsteak tartare.  Both were amazingly tender and fresh.  The freshness of the beef... it felt like eating a bit of blue fin tuna, with the same color.  Loved both.  Sixth Course:  Charcuterie.  Certainly, all the dried meats were good, although I would say that the only standout was the blood sausage.  Everything else I could say, I've had before.   Seventh Course:  Ribeye, grilled baby corn and Robuchon's mashed potatoes.  The grilled baby corn was really spectacular, a little crispy, saltiness, a little bit of richness from the sprinkled mayonaise.  The ribeye is perfectly cooked, perfectly aged, wonderfully tender and smoky.  The absolute star of the show, however, was the mashed potatoes.  With a description of \"butter, butter, more butter... and some potatoes\", they are definitely not the most heart healthy selection.  Nor, of course, is this the most sophisticated of plates... it is quite literally a ton of butter and some smashed potatoes to hold them together.  Except you can't stop eating them.  There were some additional little bites for dessert, but by that point, of course one is completely stuffed.    It was a wonderful, memorable dinner.  The price, of course, means that you have to remember it, because you can't possibly afford to do this very often.  For special occassions, this meal is definitely worth the price.",

    "text": "Dinner at Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres was hands down my best meal of the year. I know it's only January, but it sets a pretty high bar. It made me giddy seeing different cuts of meat cooking in the large open kitchen on the way to our table. It's massive and the decor is very eclectic with gator head statues and large murals. I was hoping for a more casual atmosphere to get my carnivore on. It was a bit loud because of some boisterous parties which I thought offsets the high-end dining vibe of the place, making it seem more casual and relaxed.  I enjoyed the Truffle and Bees cocktail but the Penicillin cocktail that my husband ordered had an odd medicinal scent which I didn't care for. It did take a while before a server got to us after we were seated. But when he did, the service was warm and everything was on point.   They were out of the suckling pig that evening but we didn't mind since we've had whole lechon twice in December. For the main course, we decided on the beef rib steak which is priced by the pound. Our server found us a lovely 2.5 lb. cut of Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus. And no, he didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked. They make the steak the way it's supposed to be cooked. Just leave your steak preferences at home and let the pros do their job.   For starters we tried The Foiffle, a small light waffle with foie foam, peanut butter and honey. Sweet and dessert-like. Great way to start a meal. I couldn't pass up two items I've never tried before, Iberico ham and geoduck. My husband said that the geoduck was all mine, since he doesn't like the clam texture. The geoduck came thinly sliced with yuzu and ginger. It was delicious and even my husband \"loved\" it. The Iberico ham, proclaimed as the best ham in the world, had dark red meat with a sweet and almost nutty flavor. We also ordered some pan de cristal with tomatoes to nibble with the ham. Not sure if I would pay so much for ham again but for a first-time experience, it was almost worth it.  When our steak finally came, it was huge and perfectly seasoned. We had it with the brussel sprout petals. Finally, we decided to box up some leftover steak to make room for the 10-piece chef's choice dessert. And boy, those leftovers made for an awesome steak and egg breakfast the next day. We went huge that night and our server delightfully shook our hands as we left. What an epic meal to start the year off right.",

    "text": "It would be a horrible shame to give Bazaar Meats anything less than five stars. No matter how we felt about our meal specifically, the decor, the service, the overall atmosphere of celebration makes Bazaar Meats a special place.  We came for a belated semi-celebration, and we definitely celebrated by getting this special tasting menu that came in at $275 a pop. We will be eating very cheaply for the next few months, but it will be worth it! We'll be feasting on the memories of this meal for longer!  Candy foie gras with crispy amaranth - absolutely amazing. What a surprise to get that melt of foie gras! I immediately wanted more.  \"Jose's taco\" (iberico de bellota ham, sturgeon caviar, gold leaf) - I did not expect a thick cut of jamon iberico to be the \"tortilla\" but this was a damn fine taco. The mix of the salty meat and the dissolving taste of the sea from the caviar left us speechless.  Live Maine scallop with green pepper, onion, tomato, and togarashi - the scallop was naturally and incredibly sweet, but this was a dish I could have skipped.  Kona abalone with dashi gelee, lemon, soy, and trout roe - the more I have gelees in fine dining, the more I long for this trend to end. I'm just not a fan! The roe was amazing though.  The classic tartare (Mindful Meats beef sirloin, parker house rolls, egg yolk) - this was the best slider I've ever had. Why isn't all tartare served like this? Absolutely incredible.   Bison, Buffalo-style with pickled celery, blue cheese, and buffalo wing sauce - they give you chopsticks to roll it up! This was a huge surprise, and a delicious one!  \"Beefsteak\" tomato tartare (tomato, black olive, romaine lettuce) - I don't particularly like tomatoes, so I liked this as much as I could possibly enjoy a tomato dish. My partner polished this off.  A-5 wagyu rib eye, grilled tableside on an ishiyaki stone - well, this explains why the air is circulating so much in Bazaar Meats, because it got real smoky! Absolutely delicious.  Lucia's salad (endive Caesar salad, parmesan, Don Becarte anchovies) - this was bite sized and added in a necessary bite of salad in the middle of the meat course.  Carabineros Spanish prawns roasted with sea salt - I wish they had peeled the prawns a bit for us as my partner and I are not experts at eating prawns! They were delicious though.  [instead of the saddle of lamb stuffed with chorizo, our waiter recommended an alteration] Suckling pig - absolutely delicious perfection. After you have this, you're pretty much out for the count though. We got a huge portion! This came with a completely unspectacular mixed salad.  Setas al Ajillo (button mushrooms, garlic, nasturtium) - I could have eaten these all night. Perfect!  Buttered potato puree (butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes) - this description is completely accurate. My heart started hurting. This ruins all mashed potatoes for you forever.  Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce - this came last. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had any more room in my stomach. It was tasty but it's really hard to follow the pig.  Desserts - we got a few small things, but the main standout was a milk chocolate caramel peanut tart. Our waiter described it as a refined Snickers. In reality, this is what every Snickers wished it could be.  To drink, I had the LN2 Don't Be A Lemon ($10), which is made tableside with liquid nitrogen and is an absolute steal. With various juices and Bacardi, this is basically a boozy sorbet.  Bazaar Meats is a meal that I will think about for some time to come. It took us a little over two hours to get through this massive meal. The best two hours I spent this Vegas trip, hands down.",

    "text": "5 stars for a fantastic Las Vegas steakhouse.  My wife and I have loved checking out the various Jose Andres restaurants across the country, so we were very excited to check out one of his premiere spots in Vegas. Bazaar Meat, located in the SLS Hotel on the North part of The Strip, is a dark and beautiful restaurant that provides a truly captivating meat experience.  My wife and I arrived for our early dinner reservations around 6pm I believe on a Friday. Due to the restaurant being absolutely packed, we decided to take a seat at the bar so that we could look over the menu in a more relaxed manner. The bartender, who was absolutely wonderful, came over to say hello, tell us a little bit about the venue and ask for our drink order. I asked her to make me the best drink she recommended, and she returned with a fun dark whisky cocktail that made for a great start to the night.  As we were looking over the menu and saw items like the super rare Kobe beef (going for $50 per ounce!), we decided getting several fun appetizers along with a few ounces of Kobe would be the way to go. The bartender agreed with this approach and helped us pick out some fun options, including the cotton candy foie gras, the super giant pork skin chicharron, patatas bravas and some beef tartare sliders. Due to the dark atmosphere, I couldn't really get good pictures of each, but they were all presented in a fun and interesting manner. The bartender had each of our items brought out one at a time to try, and it all tasted fantastic. In particular, the cotton candy foie gras and beef tartare sliders were absolutely amazing! Even if you are eating dinner, I recommend getting these as starters for your meal.  After getting through our apps, we moved on to the kobe beef. While 2 ounces doesn't sound like much, it actually does get you enough for a few bites for each person. The beef was actually cooked in front of us on a stone. The kobe was absolutely fantastic and worth getting more of if you can afford it (although some of the meats being cooked over in their open kitchen area looked great as well).  Overall, Bazaar Meat is a fantastic Jose Andres steakhouse. The wonderful food, service and atmosphere make this a must-do for any foodie and/or steak lover who visits Las Vegas.",

Be warned, you'll be dropping a pretty penny at this place.  We ordered the following dishes:  - Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron (5/5 --would order again) - Croquetas de Pollo (5/5 -- would order again. It came in a cute, little IG-worthy plastic too. Best way to describe this: chicken pot pie in bite-sized pieces.  - The Waygu Hanger Steak (5/5 -- would order again. A bit tougher than your usual steakhouse cuts, but this was juicy, flavorful and incredibly well liked by our table.  - Wagyu/Black Angus Beef Rib Steak (5/5 -- would order again. Fatty, grilled and well-marinated to perfection. This was the most expensive dish this evening and the Black Angus delivered solid stars. - Merino Lamb Rack (4/5 -- I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but it wasn't that bad here! My boyfriend and sister loved it though! It was a bit more game-y than I'd like it. A few others agreed too. - Cauliflower Steak (5/5 -- would order again.)  If you're looking for another IG-worthy shot and decent drink, order the following drinks: - Magic Mojito - D* Be a Lemon  Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, thank you for a great evening. Again, you were fantastic and my table had a great time.",

We made reservations for 7:00, arrived a bit early and we were immediately seated. Our waiter Gerardo was great explaining the different kinds of dining experience and he was super attentive throughout our meal. We really wanted to try the ribeye Wagyo cut but their smaller cut  was almost two pounds and it was only my husband and I so we decided to get 8 oz of Skirt Steak and 8 oz of Flat Iron meat. We also ordered the Buttered mashed potatoes, which were so yummy, the lettuce and radish salad with aoioli and spinach side. Everything was very tasty but I do believe a little overpriced. At least for the two cuts that we had.",

Sat at the bar by myself so I could watch the kitchen. Talk about flawless execution and on point service. I highly recommend the Summer Menu. By far my favorite was the Bagel, lox and CC, and during my courses I ordered another. The highlight of my evening was when I was taken on a tour of the various stations and even treated to a slice of cured meat. That paired with a beautiful Tempernaillo blend was to die for. And get this, next on the house was cotton candy foie gras. By the time I got to my beef wellington I was stuffed, but it along with the dessert menu was a great midnight snack.  I loved it so much I went back the following night and ordered strictly from the appetizer plates OMG the chicken croquets were so lightly fried...they just melt in your mouth.  The entire world should know what it is to eat like this. My sincere thanks to the entire team (especially Stacey) for making this an experience I will never forget!",

One thing i need to let everyone know is that the meat takes a WHILE to get cooked due to the method of how they cook it. There is most certainly other tid bits u can order as you wait. Our bone-in 2.75 lb Washugyu ribeye took 1 hr to be prepared. Worth the wait cooked in an open fire cherry wood (perfect smoky charr taste). My most favorite part besides the meat itself is how its prepared. A little salt and nothing else, tasting the meat in its Truest form. Dry aged for 45 days its the least fatning ribeye i ever had. Washugyu is what they are calling it that comprises of 75% wagyu from Japan and 25% black angus. Matched with their grilled leeks with a balsamic reduction was a perfect combination with the meat.",

We sat at the bar and the service was excellent. The service was prompt and the interior of the restaurant was lovely.  As we sat at the bar, we ordered a sampling of the happy hour items and also the authentic Kobe beef! The Kobe beef served here is one of the only places in the United States you can get real Kobe beef delivered directly from Japan. It was incredible and served in tiny slices and cooked fresh on a hot rock at your table. It was an incredible experience and worth the high cost.   As far as the happy hour items, we tried the foie gras cotton candy, the chicharones, the suckling pig sandwich, the kobe beef air bread and beef tartare sliders. We also tried the house red and the salt foam margarita!  The salt-foam margarita was incredible and well worth the price. The house red was underwhelming and I would opt for something else. The chicharones were fine, as were the sliders. The suckling pig sandwich was fun and the air bread was tasty. However, the foie gras cotton candy was incredible! It was savory and sweet and so creative. We both ordered a second round and I could eat a ton of these.   Overall, this is an exceptional restaurant featuring incredible meats and unique options.",

    "text": "Had a great meal at Bazaar meat last night for a buddies birthday. The restaurant is chic and interesting yet too dark. Turn up the lights a bit. My only complaint is it's location in a small down market casino (SLS) I had never heard of. They must have paid some big bucks to get Jose but I don't think clientele from this casino is patronizing the restaurant. Too bad about the location I hope it does not sink the restaurant. On to the food. This is a tapas restaurant for meat. Sharing is a must. Don't order a steak for yourself. We started with the cotton candy foi gras which apparently everyone orders. A bit gimmicky but good. Tastes like foi gras wrapped in cotton candy as advertised. We then had a nice selection of raw oysters. They need to add PEI oysters which are the best. They mostly had west coast options. We then had the Parmesan breadsticks wrapped in carpaccio with an onion dip which was tasty but not amazing. The table next to us ordered the steak tartar with Parker rolls which looked better and was a sizable portion. For an entree we split the ribeye which was bone in and about 20oz with the bone. More than enough food for two hungry guys. We did the wagyu-Holstein mix which was nicely marbled. They suggested that option over the straight Holstein which I would usually ordered as the straight Holstein was apparently tough. Not sure why this would be and presumably they can source a tender cut which is not a wagyu hybrid. If you don't like highly marbled (fatty) meat pick something else. It was delicious however and I like marbles. My partner ordered the steak cooked medium and it was served med rare or even rare. No surprise as this happens often. The Delmonico potatoes were delicious and worth ordering. Think double baked potato with cheese. No veggies on our table, we were pure carnivores. That was definitely enough food. For desert we did not get to choose as they did a special birthday selection of small deserts items that were all good but to be honest did not blow me away. The tart with Carmel was the best but we should have ordered from the desert menu. What made the night was the Somm. I wanted red wine and my partner wanted to drink Martinis so I called to Somm over and he worked with me to offer some high end French old world Bordeaux by the glass so I did not have to buy a full bottle. He brought 3 bottles over for me to taste which was fun and we settled on one I liked and he gave me a very fair cut rate deal for such a fine wine ($60 per glass as opposed to $90 per glass). As I said we were celebrating. Our bill with drinks was $400 which felt appropriate for such a meal. Not cheap however so leave room on your card. All in all a very fine evening and my partner loved the experience. During the meal we had a 7.1 earthquake and the chandeliers started swinging.  Staff handled this with no issues and everyone shrugged it off.  So go already.",

The good news is that if you are on a budget, you can sit in the bar area and enjoy discounted plates and drinks.  We enjoyed the roasted octopus, 1905 carpaccio, and the gazpacho soup.  The carpaccio was served with shaved parmesian, fresh herbs and a drizzle of oil ($24).  The octopus was  served in a small bowl with a reduction of something wonderful ($12 on happy hour menu).  The gazpacho was the smaller of the two servings in a high-ball glass with a round ice cube in it.  Service was excellent throughout. If I return, I shall try the cotton candy mojito.  They have a cotton candy machine at the bar and it was fun watching them make various dishes with it.",

    "text": "Came here for our 5th year anniversary dinner and we definitely weren't disappointed. The restaurant is located in SLS which is eh, but it the restaurant itself was a great experience.  Once we arrived for our reservation time we were seated right away and the hostesses congratulated us on our anniversary.  Our server explained the menu in detail since this was our first experience. We both ended up sharing some plates to get the most out of the experience.  Caviar trio - we wanted to try the trio that had the salmon caviar and was not disappointed. It came with a puffed kind of cracker with sides of red onions, eggs, egg whites, olive tapenade and I want to say maybe parsley.   Bison carpaccio - must order. This melts in your mouth.  Buttered potatoes - very creamy and buttery. I almost ate the whole thing on my own.  Asparagus - grilled with a tomato like sauce. Delicious.  Steak - I honestly don't remember what steak we ordered but it was prepared perfectly. We ordered medium rare and it was just enough pink where we enjoyed the flavor of the steak.  Overall if you are a meat lover, then this place is a must try. They also offer tasting menus where you have a little bit of everything. Portions are a good size to share and the staff was impeccable. Everyone that worked their was so nice and friendly. Definitely would come back again to try other items here.",

From the moment we arrived we were greeted and given a tour of the restaurant. Our server was exceptionally helpful and eager to make sure that we experienced an amazing dinner. We went with the Jose's Way Tasting Menu for $185pp and it was the best choice for tasting lots of items on the menu. The Cotton Candy Foie Gras is a hands down must for anyone along with the Bagel & Lox comes. We could have devoured 100 of these! We would recommend this outstanding dining experience to anyone wanting a special night out!!",

The cotton candy foil gras was amazing. The beef carpaccio wrap around the parmigiana bread stick is a must try for large groups. I can't wait to go back!!   My only gripe was that I sat in the bar on a week night and it wasn't busy there and felt kind of cold and empty. I walked into the dinning area and it was lively and busy and you could see all of the food stations.",

    "text": "Without trying to break the bank, I wanted to sample some of the food at Bazaar Meat. I decided to sit at the bar so I could sample their Bar Centro menu. Since the food here is tapas style, I ordered a number of dishes including oysters, gazpacho shot, croquetas de jamon, cotton candy foie gras, \"beefsteak\" tomato, and the suckling pig sandwich pair with their house sauvignon blanc wine.   The oysters were from British Columbia. They were really tiny, but were really good. The gazpacho shot (composed of green peppers, tomato, and green pepper) was refreshing to the palette. The croquetas de jamon were served in a plastic molded shoe. It was actually a really nice presentation, although I'd never eat from a real shoe.   I am an avid fan of foie gras. When the cotton candy foie gras was brought to my table, I basically ate the exterior of the cotton candy until I reached the center of the cotton candy which housed the tiny piece of foie gras. At first, I thought it was an odd combination to have cotton candy, but it works as a food pairing that complement each other in the sweetest way.  Towards the end of my meal, I ate their \"beefsteak\" tomato which is ironically a vegetable tartare. After taking a bite out of the beefsteak tomato, I realized that I should have chosen a dish that was more substantial in protein like real steak.   Finally, the suckling pig sandwich was delicious. It had some of the skin intact from the pig which enhanced the flavor. I am excited to one day come back to Bazaar Meat and try their regular menu although just be prepared to allocate a large sum of money to pay for the large bill.",

We had the wagyu jerky, beef carpaccio, salad with yummy lemon dressing, small potatoes and sauteed spinach. I had the Manhattan OMG! So delish!!! Our waiter, Matthew was so incredibly knowledgeable as he worked at the Miami outlet and gave us major history on Jose Andres which was so cool!

Jose Andres' reputation is already established. He doesn't *need* this place to make it. You can go to his restaurant in Beverly Hills or... come have a much better time in Vegas at Bazaar. The experience we had was excellent!  You can choose to go ala carte, order the tasting menu, or go boldly and order as you please. No matter what path you choose, the staff will not let you go wrong. Just remember; you are paying for service, so listen to their sage advice. From the kitchen, to the restaurant floor, these professionals will help make your experience exceptional. Have faith in them, put yourself in their hands, and you will not be disappointed.   Fair warning: You're now in a restaurant for grown people. The food is expensive for all the reasons I've listed above. Its possible to make this work on a budget, but getting out of here for less than $300 for two people with drinks is pretty unlikely. You will most likely feel cheated. Come here because you have the money to spend for an *exceptional* dining experience. You will feel the love Jose Andres has for his roots in Spain, and respect him flexing his culinary muscles here with us. He's a master. Thanks for sharing with us Jose.",

    "text": "I wanted to try Bazaar Meat for a while, so I chose to come here for my bday dinner date with my hubby. We had a wonderful time! They do a great job being high end without being pretentious. Very friendly service, our server really knew his stuff. We decided to try the tasting (the least expensive of the three tasting menus) and it was quite fun. Each dish was creative and delicious. The menu is a little intimidating so it was nice to not have to choose what to order. But now that I have tried several menu items I would surely opt to create my own menu rather than choosing the tasting menu.  My faves: FOIE COTTON CANDY. Buttered Potato Puree. Grilled Asparagus. Classic Tartare. I would love to go back and try the Kobe, Sea Urchin, Foieffle, Suckling Pig. Didn't love: The Chateaubriand. Was well prepared, well seasoned, just not my favorite cut of meat.  Why 4 stars? While we had a wonderful time and everything was great, my least favorite part of the meal was the meat. I feel that the meat should really shine at a steakhouse, especially at this price point.",

    "text": "This was our last meal in a series of 5 star restaurant dining and it was the obvious show stopper.  Everything, every detail, was phenomenal.  Let me start out by saying that Alex and Tony were an amazing team and  assistant manager, Pano, gave me a tour of the entire 5 kitchen masterpiece.  I'm pretty sure that Tony and my husband started a bromance over talks of scotch and he won my 3 year old daughter over with the plate of desserts at the end.    So what did we get?  A little bit of everything.  The cotton candy foie gras was probably the most fun thing that I ate all week.  Other appetizers included the tartare (which honestly, my husband is a purist so he wasn't a huge fan of the anchovy, but I loved), we ordered the Croquetas de Pollo, Sloppy Joe, and Foieffle for our daughter but she was being *difficult* so we ended up eating them for her.  Fantastic.  Get-The-Foieffle!  I know what you're thinking, could you even eat anymore after that?  The answer is yes.  We couldn't stop eating the delicious foods in front of us.  For our main, my husband got the Bone-In Strip Loin cooked medium because we were told that a ribeye would take at least an hour and we didn't expect to be there for that long; we were there for a little over two.  So for future reference, if you're eating here, you're going to be there for over an hour anyway, so get the steak you want.  That being said, we still LOVED the strip.  It was amazing.  (Good suggestion, Tony).   I got the Braised Lamb Neck.  Some reviews I'd checked online said it was too rich or salty and my personal opinion is that they were wrong.  The meat was so tender and the flavor was out of this world. I'm obsessed with the oyster catsup that came on it and the little fried oysters were just a great texture to throw in.  Simply amazing.  We try to not hit up the same restaurants every time we go to Vegas, but we've pretty much decided that we will make an exception for Bazaar Meat.  I'm going to point out something that Pano said to me during the tour:  this is NOT a steakhouse.  This is an experience.  And when you go in there you will see how passionate everyone who works there is about what they are offering to their guests.  P.S.  Tony?  We demolished those desserts, thank you!",

    "text": "On a business trip to Vegas and really stayed away from the strip to eat more local stuff versus the food you find on the strip. This is the place we decided to go on a recommendation when we did venture over to the strip. Know that when you park you will either valet or park in a garage. Not a big deal but be aware that Parking isn't that easy.   We were able to get a table pretty easily. I only this place 4 stars not because of the food but because of the price. Yes, they have a ton of options and I'm sure they're all excellent. What I would complain about would be the prices for some of the menu items. They charged $15 for all sides. To be honest, they weren't all worth $15. They said it could feed 2 and they did. But there's only so much you can do with asparagus. They grilled it and the some cheese on top. Bam, $15. Do that a couple of times and your bill really gets up there.   Finally, be aware that the entire menu is family style. So when ordering, you have to make it work for everyone at the table. They have smaller portion sizes but you guessed it, overpriced in my opinion. We picked something we knew we could finish. It was excellent. Prepared well and very tasty. I just couldn't get over the price and really couldn't justify it.  The wine selection was great but somewhat limited if ordering by the glass.",

We ordered 1/4 suckling pig, aged wagyu ribeye, chateau briand, cotton candy foie gras and other apps. We were very excited about the pig and steaks. All three were tasteless. Maybe lacking in salt. The ribeye was dry and full of fat (actually half of it was fat). The Chateau was cooked pretty well, but tasteless. Cotton candy was the highlight, except the kids loved it and took our share. We saw the billboard saying that this was top 5 US steakhouse. Tonight was certainly not the night.",

    "text": "This review is rated upon the fact that Bazaar is known as one of the best steak houses in the United States. If you were to stumble in here in hopes of a good meal, you would receive just that. However, good is where it ends. In terms of the actually execution of every dish, it was quite nice. The issue itself is based upon the recipes themselves. To start the meal, we were persuaded with the live scallop. Yes, just one scallop that was incredibly overpowered by a sour vinaigrette as well as Serrano peppers. The flavors did not bring out the delicacy of the scallops but instead masked the flavors and created a unharmonious dish. Next was the classic tartare which we had heard great things about. The quality of the meat is undeniable, but the accouterments were lack luster. At this price range I would expect... no demand fresh rolls. Instead we were served cold and slightly stale mini rolls. The entire table agreed that we would of preferred a luke warm Hawaiian roll to what we were served. The octopus was quite nice, it was very tender and had a slight taste of the fire it was cooked on but again, the notes of the dish felt quite muddled and flat. And finally we arrive at the main course, the creme de la creme of culinary beef. Be warned that the size steak you pay for is not what you receive. Our bone was twice as thick as the actual strips of beef that lay on the plate. Yes I understand a steak shrinks, but there is no way a aged 2 pound steak is turned into a lackluster one pound over priced mess.   If you wanted a great steak, I could assure you that I could prepare a steak of higher class in my kitchen. It was unevenly seasoned and chewier than any steak over $60 should ever be. This steak is prepared over an open flame but not a hint of smoke or any real flavor can be found. The leaks we received were cold but when we let the waiter know they did take those off the bill. So kudos on proper service. The three of us agreed that the best part of the meal were the button mushrooms. Let that set in... the best part of a $300 meal were a side of button mushrooms.   A completely uninspired meal in a cluster fuck of an uninspired restaurant.",

Our waitress barely check up on us and we waited at least 30 mins for the main entree after finishing all of our appetizer. When we were done, I wanted dessert but couldn't find our waitress. We waited for another 30 mins and noticed everyone else was just standing around chatting. I finally asked the bust boy to get us the bill because I was so annoyed. Waited another 15 min, no bill. Had to ask for it again and the bust boy said he was waiting on the waitress for that. Took another 15 min until we finally got our bill. Meanwhile, the table next to us receive wonderful service and they came in after us. I understand if you're busy but when u have ppl standing around doing nothing, This is unacceptable. For the price that we are paying, we expect good service if not good food. Now as far as the food, it wasn't all that great either. A little bit on the salty side or just plain bland. First time here and would never come back! Thanks for ruining our Valentines dinner. I'm only taking off 2 stars for service and one for food..... and yes I did leave a tip even though I wanted to leave none.",

It was not \"melt in your mouth\" I was expecting for the price I paid and had to spit out some of the tough parts.  Shame on you for charging people $$$$ for Sizzler quality meat.  And then our server recommended the Robuchon potatoes without any warning of the artery clogging amount of butter it had.  Overall, I've had better steak elsewhere and will probably avoid this place in the future.",

    "text": "Best Restaurant I've been to in the United States! True story.  Let's start with the service. We arrived a little early so the hostess sat us at the bar for cocktails. Our bartender was nice, but what was most impressive is that he had a good knowledge of the items on the food menu so we were able to get a head start on all the awesome details surrounding the food and its sources. Once we were seated, our server, Natalie, introduced herself and was most gracious, and throughout our meal, everyone from the staff who came by our table was also very gracious and polite.   We had been looking forward to trying the suckling pig so when Natalie told us that they had run out, I was a little dismayed. They, however, made it up to us by giving us a complimentary serving of a range of things from their menu. We started off with the Brussels Sprouts Petals salad, which is one of the best salads I've ever had - the petals weren't bitter as they can be sometimes and the rest of the components had the right amount of moisture so the salad wasn't soggy. We chased the salad with their raw oysters with were, again, some of the best I've ever had. They were so fresh and the salt water from which they were taken seasoned them perfectly. Following the oysters we were served complimentary Pommes Paillasson and the Straws - perfectly done. Our meat dish was the Braised Lamb Neck, which the bartender warned us would be rich. And it was! It's served in the size and shape of a 4Oz steak and looks fairly harmless, but is very rich with great flavor. I'd recommend sharing the lamb neck plate because it can be a little too rich for one person. All in all, the food was delicious and well-presented.   The decor was great too. The walk through the SLS was a little weird and the place was empty, but once we were in the restaurant, I enjoyed the setting and walking past the grill and meat case on our way to our table - great mix of form and function for a steakhouse.",

Upon discovery of this situation, the manager, Pano, immediately took action and corrected the meat, he replaced it with much tender cut of the beef.  At the end, he asked our server, Stephanie, which had the best customer service quality, to not charge for the steak.  They completely turn our dining experience around into the most positive experience.  We will definitely recommend this place to our friends.  Great job, Pano and Stephanie. We will be back.",

(So are the chicharrones).But what they feature is fascinating.  The \"traditional\" carpaccio is as good as there is. The chef's selection of charcuterie is worth trying, a remarkable variety. The steaks, especially the ribeyes, are terrific. However, keep in mind that everything is served tapas or family style...including the steaks. It is not a traditional steakhouse. You do not need to order a steak for each person. If you do, they come out separately. I'd recommend having fun with the smaller plates and then getting a steak to share.  The wine list, especially the Spanish and French selections, is impressive but pricey.  Will definitely return, but will order differently.",

A few things are different, and there's an overwhelming amount of meat choices, which is wonderful. Not a big fan of the nori meat tacos, I think the anago cucumber ones in LA are better. Also, the Philly cheesesteaks are missing too, which was a bummer. But, the wagyu beef was on point, the wine list is solid, the patisserie tasty, and everything else was great.

I can now say that Bazaar meat is a perfect addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene and I give it two thumbs up.  Although the SLS is a bit down the strip, make the trip to eat here.  Again with Jose Andres the cuisine is spanish tapas with molecular gastronomy however this is a meat themed restaurant.  Many high end meets that include kobe beef at 40 dollars an ounce with a minimum of 6 ounces can pack a punch in your wallet but the meat quality is A+.  I opted for a tasting menu course which there are 4 of and the amount of food for the price was impeccable.  We added the classic beef tartare which was prepared at table side and it was one of the best tartars I've ever had.  The chateaubriand was cooked to perfection and we were all stuffed.  The waitstaff and service were perfect not too overbearing, but my water glass was never empty.  I plan on coming here many times in the future.  Awesome addition! Jose does it again!",

I was served a.small portion from shoulder area filled with layers of fat. Im Cuban and we roasts pigs all the time. In Miami or California there is no way you pay $140 for a 2 lb portion of pig. Yolo and I figured this has to be different. Not. Roasted pig is roasted pig is roasted pig. It's not a fine peace of beef. We each paid $275 for the pre-set menu. Service was poorly timed ,waiters friendly but lacking training. After spending $550 between on this experience I felt it was not worth it. Have your steaks at a real steak house. Some things are ok , the place is half empty for a reason. Overpriced. Fair food and friendly but Denny's quality service. Good luck.",

If I was just rating the food I would give it 4 stars. We had the tartare sliders, salmon tartare, pork skin, rack of lamb (our fav), chicken, robuchon potatoes, cauliflower, and the suckling pig. Although pricey the ingredients were very good quality and prepared perfectly. I had to give this experience 3 stars because the ambience and dining experience wasn't there for the price tag. Our table in particular was in a very awkward spot and small for 5 people at a family style restaurant. Our waitress seemed very flustered and we felt forgotten about. The menu was a little confusing. It's tapas but she had us order everything at once and then the timing on how our items came out was off. The sommelier never visited our table and our waitress barely checked in on us. Also I expect a restaurant of this caliber to do something a little extra when you make a reservation and say it's for a celebration, most fine dining I've eaten at always does this and our waitress never even mentioned or asked anything. Anyway bottom line food was excellent but for the price I expected a better and more enjoyable dining experience. We are local but I won't be going back",

The last time we went a server made an error and brought us the Gazpacho shots meant for another table and when we told then we did not order them, they let us keep them free of charge as well as bringing us an additional app to have free of charge. Wonderful food, great selection, pricey alcohol (but what isn't on the strip), and a great experience overall.",

This is not a steak house.  The food was OK. However, I felt like there was no congruity between what we were served and the prices.  Perhaps I should have done more research ahead of my meal.  If I had I would have gone somewhere else.",

    "text": "On a recent visit to Las Vegas--solo, mind you--I found myself with the option to try any restaurant my heart desires, but something was tugging me back to Bazaar Meat.  You see, a year or so ago, my wife and I spent weeks deciding on which place to dine for the celebratory meal for our marriage, and after highly scrutinizing the lists, we settled on Bazaar Meat.  We arrived full of excitement and anticipation for what we'd expected to be one of the finer dining experiences of our lives... what we had was a 3-hour experience where our server treated us like royalty, but our food was incredibly underwhelming and bland.  At close to $400, we expected more.  So fast forward to my free night after a successful work day, and I found myself on the phone, asking about stopping in.  I'd just walked the length of the strip and back and settled into a spot at the bar, where the full menu awaits.  As the server approached, I explained why I was back--a chance for redemption.  She asked me to hold my thought, and stepped away for a few minutes before returning.  To put it lightly, the red carpet was rolled out for me.  No, my meal wasn't free, but many courses were provided and I couldn't draw a comparison between the two visits.  This time, the steak was cooked to perfection, which was an ideal entree after the smoked oysters and several other bites beforehand.  The sprouts were heavenly, and the potatoes (which I said I wouldn't want) were a very welcome freebie, as they were hands down the best I've had outside of Peru.    The best compliment I can pay in addition to the appreciation and pleasure received on this visit, is that I will indeed make it a point to return with my wife so she can experience what we both missed out on a year ago.  Well done, Bazaar Meat, redemption granted!",

Great wine list & some craft beer can complement you dinner. There high quality of products definitely sets them up for success.   There kitchen equipment is spectacular,  the wood burning grill greets you on your way in and sets high expectations. When your steak gets to your table it's worth every penny melts in your mouth!  Great for a romantic dinner or just enjoying food at it's finest.  If you are at the SLS Hotel Las Vegas you must stop at Bazaar Meat what an experience!",

I started with the cotton candy cocktail, which was good but probably not worth the $. It was a really pretty and whimsical presentation though.  We tried a variety of dishes, and our waiter was so kind in sending some samples from the kitchen: the cotton candy foie gras (same as what Bazzar in LA had before banning foie gras), the bagel and lox cone (not worth the $, save it for the main course!), the smoked and ice oysters (an unique take worth trying), and the Foieffle (A MUST).  For the main course we had the Mishima Reserve (their steaks go by weight, I think ours was around 2 lbs. with plenty to take home), the mushrooms (an unique take different from your average roasted), and the Delmonico (very Joel Robuchon like). It was fantastic, and overall up there with my personal favorite, Craftsteak. I really do recommend coming with a large party so you can try lots of different things.  We really wanted to try the suckling pig and our waiter recommended the sandwich version. I didn't find it particularly special, but maybe the real entree is more noteworthy.   All in all, a great choice to dine, but of course one must make the trip all the way down to SLS!",

We had a 10p reservation for right after our show... which was The Eddie Griffin Experience... which was right next door... like less than 100 feet away.  We got there at 10:09p and we were told that they have a 10 mn grace period and that their kitchen closed at 10p and could not serve us. (Note: We has a 10p reservation) The hostess was, in a word, inexperienced!  She basically refused to serve us, and was so matter of fact about their \"rule\" of 10 mns late = loss of reservation.  She could care less that we were paying customers, who just spent money on a show down the hall that had just ended and precluded us. from being there any earlier.  If you wonder why the SLS is dead these days... it's because they simply do not have the service of the other hotels.  After being refused service for being 9 mns late, we left and had a delicious dinner at STK in the Cosmopolitan (which was hopping with people at 10:45p on a Monday night) This was after eating a perfect dinner at the new Scotch 80 Prime inside of The Palms the night before.  We spent over $500 on that bill... so, who is the loser?  You, Bazaar Meat.  I'll be sure to tell all of my friends.",

Every single person on this perfectly put together and in sink team, each equally important in their role. Everyone was so  knowledgeable and offered exquisite service.  With that said !! I ordered the classic tasting menu. And every single dish on there was so flavorful and perfectly paired to make your mouth water!!! I can't say enough good things about this Restaurant.   I think the classic tartare was the best beef tartare I have ever had! So tasty. Then such a small yet still as important tapas, the olive and wrapped bagel lox, was so amazing. Even then endives Cesar salad was so flavorful, leaving you wanting more. Seriously everything I tasted there was amazing the chef even made me their Tomato steak-tartare and that was so fresh, juicy and flavorful. I don't think there is any wrong choices here. Right down to the amazing and creative desert and we can't forget the drinks. I had their smoked old fashion. I can with out a doubt say that is the best smoked old fashion I have tasted!   Thank you so much to the manager Pano and Elias the meat captain who helped me with my choices and gave me the more then first class service. I'll be returning for sure and I highly recommend you all do as well. It's really worth every dollar spent here.  I can't believe I haven even here before but i promise it won't be the last!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a group of 4 others.  While it doesn't quite earn 5 stars from me (which I don't often give), Bazaar Meat comes damn close!  Bazaar Meat isn't cheap, that's for certain, and the dining experience does take a while, but nearly everything I tried here was excellent!  I truly don't recall a low point of this meal, from the service to the quality of the food to the decor. Even the displays of raw meat and vintage slicers and food prep equipment at the center of this restaurant where some of the cooking and food prep. is done were a really cool touch to the look of the place!  When we were given menus, I was a bit confused at first, as some of their meats were listed as 2.5 pounds.  One of the steaks listed in the \"not so big\" section of the menu was 22 oz!  What??  Then along came our server to explain that the concept here is to order a few dishes that are large enough to be shared.  He also explained that some of their cuts of meat are made to be cooked, smoked or go through other types of preparation that takes several hours.  Here they basically do the hours of work ahead of time so that most of their meats simply need to go through the last 40 or so minutes of cooking and preparation once you order them.  This made one of the guys at our table a bit nervous as we were seated at 7 and he needed to depart for the airport no later than 8:30 to catch a red eye.  Our server promised this wouldn't be a problem, and certainly enough, he was right.  For starters we had the croquetas de jamon and gazpacho shots. For the main courses, we had the pork loin with roasted apples, the lamb and the tenderloin steak. We also ordered the asparagus and spinach with apple, pine nuts, shallots and raisins.  As mentioned, I can't remember a downside to the meal, everything was excellent and all the meat dishes were cooked perfectly. I also liked that a side was included and served with nearly every one of the meat dishes which complimented it perfectly...The pork came with roasted apples, the steak came with a sauce and the lamb also was delivered with a condiment to compliment the flavor of the meat.  We left here full but not stuffed which was great, and to boot, they got the one member of our party out the door in time to catch his flight, just as the server promised!",

    "text": "This place exceeded all expectations. Wasn't really sure what to expect as its in SLS which was empty. The restaurant was going full on though and was amazing.   Food wise, the cotton candy fois gras was in the top 3 things I have ever eaten. From there we had several different kinds of oysters, caviar, and table side tartar. All of were very good. From there we had the reserve ribeye which was also very good. We ordered a few different desserts, all of which were great small bites. And then we had more for fois, seriously it was that good.   All of this made an above average meal, but what really pushed it over the top was our waitress Chelsea. She was one of the most knowledgable and personable servers anywhere. Not only did she know everything about the menu, she took the time to craft our dinner experience specifically to our tastes. She was amazing.",

    "text": "We made reservations for dinner around 7pm for 2 people (my husband and I). The place was busy but not full. At first glance we were loving the open kitchen and different stations set ups. That was until they took us to the very back station, the only one that is closed off, and sat us at a big table for just the two of us. We were the only ones in the room, at a big table in the middle of the room, we just felt awkward.   Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly but she seemed to have been busy outside of the seafood room that we were located in. We sat for a long time with nothing on our table and the flow of food was off and weird. We were told that the food would come out as it was ready and then the cold Brussels were one of the last things that we were served. Even the table next to us ( that got sat after us) complained about not receiving any of their dishes.   We ordered 8 \"shared\" items. Some items were only a bite, some were to \"share\" and then the steaks were huge. This concept was weird for us. The 8 items we ordered plus two dessert \"bites\" and a coffee our bill was $170! If we would've ordered a steak 20oz plus would've been over $120. We completely understand sharing and the idea of that is great but maybe this restaurant isn't for 2 people but maybe geared for larger parties.   We started with the cotton candy foie gras, that was fun and unique. The Ruben was probably our favorite thing, full of flavor and different. We did have to order two of rubens just so we could both try it. The sloppy joes were anything to brag about. The Asian tacos aren't worth your time, the iberico was improperly sliced and was placed on top of just a slice of nori. The blood sausage with uni was under seasoned, this dish you were given 5 bites. As I mentioned before the placement of the dishes were strange, out last two courses were the corn and Brussels we ordered. The Brussels were cold and didn't have enough acid in them. $15 for a bowl of cold Brussels, no thanks. The last dish we received was the corn, a take on Mexican corn. The flavor was there but I could've used a lime or some salt to add to it.   Dessert was brought out on a serving platter and you got to pick what you wanted which was different and fun. We were celebrating my husbands birthday so our server brought out an extra dessert for him Which was very thoughtful.   Overall we were disappointed, maybe we should've gotten the suckling pig because that is their featured item. We like to go out to eat and order a lot of things to share and try new things. Not a spot for that without spending a lot.   If we were to come back it would be to get the \"Vaca vieja\" with the hopes that we could sit in the actual dining room and enjoy that ambiance.",

I didn't feel like it was super fancy or that we didn't belong there. Christopher was our server who was AMAZING! He broke down the menu for us so it was easy to understand and best of all he rearranged my portion of my dinner option so it was preggo-friendly and my husband still got to eat what we ordered (we ordered one of the specials where we share the portions). They also made me a mocktail which was nice since I couldn't drink obviously.   The food was FABULOUS! The meat was incredibly tender, the potatoes melted in your mouth they were so good, and the desserts were fantastic. I love that we got to try new things that we never thought we would like such as foi gras with cotton candy....AMAZING.   Highly recommend for a date night out and are willing to try new and different things. It is a bit pricey but soooo worth it in my opinion. Its always nice to spoil yourself every once in a while for a fun date night. Also, everyone was dressed somewhat casual but not to casual. I saw people wearing jeans and just a nice top.",

    "text": "3.5 stars. I should preface this by saying we ate here on Thanksgiving, and we did the Thanksgiving prix fixe menu and ordered one small \"Vaca Vieja\" steak to try. I should also preface by saying we live in New York and MIGHT be a bit particular when it comes to fine dining and our steaks... Anyway, with that out of the way.  We arrived for our 8pm reservation a few minutes early and were told to wait at the bar. There were three hostesses working at the stand which was weird because hostess #1 asked us our name and when we told her, hostess #3 answered us and told us to wait at the bar. Whatever. There was no indication at this point that they were running behind. At about 8:25, a DIFFERENT hostess (hostess #2?) came up to us at the bar and said \"Did you have a reservation?\" Uh, yeah. 25 minutes ago. So then we finally got seated. No apologies for running late, no \"thanks for your patience,\" no comp for the drink we ordered while waiting, nothing. We already had a slightly bad taste in our mouth over this just because, if we're shelling out a bunch of money for a fine dining experience, we expect really great service and treatment. The hostesses definitely need better training at this particular restaurant.  Anyway, once we were finally sat, our waiter was quite pleasant and nice. As I mentioned, we went with the Thanksgiving prix fixe. We also went ahead and tried the Vaca Vieja ribeye steak (literal translation = old cow) since Jose Andres is said to be such a meat god. I have to say the Vaca Vieja was SUPER underwhelming. The cow is 8-10 years old and from my understanding gets old and fat in that time and develops a delicious beefy flavor. But the steak we got (although cooked to a perfect medium rare) was lean, tough, and underseasoned. I've eaten some amazingly delicious ribeyes in my life, and they tend to be fatty and delicious and crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth good on the inside. This just... wasn't. We actually ended up sending it back (which I swear we never do). Our waiter was extremely nice about it. The Thanksgiving prix fixe was pretty damn good. Nothing stellar to report here, but it was definitely solid.   The last point I want to make about this restaurant is the ambiance. It felt really cheap and corporate. The chairs at the bar that we waited in for 25 minutes must have been from IKEA as they were flimsy and wobbly. The dining table and chairs we sat at looked like they were secondhand. The decor in general felt like someone had said \"make it feel hip and modern, but don't spend too much money!\" I honestly think this is more of an SLS issue than a restaurant issue, because for example if you go to China Poblano (a cheaper Jose Andres restaurant in the Cosmo) it's amazingly well done inside and feels cool and authentic.  All in all, JUST okay. Not bad. Still have much respect for Chef Andres. I would not come back to Bazaar Meats, but definitely will be back to check  e (his other higher end restaurant) the next time I'm in Vegas which I have a feeling will be a much more fabulous experience.",

Everything on that menu is definitely worth the price paying. If you do decide to stop by Bazaar Meat, don't expect to receive your meals all at once or quickly, these chefs and servers do the best to ensure that your food comes out at a nice, even flow to ensure the best eating experience.   The one thing I definitely recommend ordering is the Chef's selection dessert box. Everything I was served was beautifully presented and tasted like heaven. My favorite of the desserts had to be the Dark Chocolate Eclair, it was the perfect combination of flaky, yet airy crust, and delicious dark chocolate cream filling.   Not only was the food amazing, but the service and atmosphere make this the perfect place to grab a bite to eat. If you're in the mood to spend quite a bit of money for some extremely high quality service and food made to perfection, Jose Andres' Bazaar Meat Is the place to go.",

I make it a point to have drinks at Barmini once a month, and enjoy Paella Sundays at Jaleo frequently, as well as had dinner at all of his D.C. restaurants (I've also watched every single episode of Made in Spain!). So it was a natural decision to try a few of his restaurants in Las Vegas. Overall, very very good.   We had a 9:30 pm reservation, so the restaurant was a little bit emptier that I wouldve expected. Decor is very Jose Andres, fun, whimsical but manages to feel upscale. They have their wood burning grills in the middle of the restaurant so it's pretty neat! We started off with the beef carpaccio with the parmesan foam (which was AMAZING), the chicken croquettes, and the Fried Oxtail steamed buns, which were out of this world.  We decided to split the Chateaubriand and ordered some sides.... OMG; best meat ever. It really delivered. Wine was great and the service as well.   Why only 4 stars, I would love to see NEW things at his restaurants. Some things I've seen over and over. However, it is definitely worth a trip and your money to eat here!",

    "text": "Wow! What an amazing find for the True carnivore with a serious appetite.  Was in town for a large industry convention and Bazaar Meat was recommended by multiple locals and my hotel concierge as an excellent fine dining spot.   I decided to make a call over and try to secure a reservation for 830 (a tough time to get really anywhere in Vegas on a convention week) unfortunately these guys were booked solid but had a 1000 available.  I took the 10pm slot hoping to squeeze in a little earlier after spending sometime at the restaurant bar.  I had never been over to the SLS hotel/casino before but really was surprised how much I liked the look and feel of the place.  SLS has a real \"LA\" style to it, also being a much smaller casino and catering to a younger crowd it didn't reek of cigarette smoke or bad perfume.  Bazaar is tucked into the rear of the SLS with a nice entrance and foyer at the front.  The restaurant looks great with unique steak and kitchen knives on display and real working butcher shop equipment.  The dry aging racks are on display with suckling pig and the beef I was about to consume.    We let the hostesses know we were there a bit early and would be at the bar.  They were friendly and upfront with us that early seating wasn't guaranteed but they would try.  Drinks at the bar were priced well for fine dining and the service was prompt.  We had a Mezcal Negroni and an Old Fashioned; both were mixed well with crystal clear square cubes.  The Negroni in particular was excellent and a unique expierence with the selected liquors, a fresh look at the standard.   We were lucky to be seated about an hour early of our reservation directly in front of one of the open air kitchens.  I don't write many reviews but really felt compelled to do so after the first rate service by our server Marc Lewandoski, this guy made the entire experience worthwhile.  His innate knowledge of the menu, pairings and source of the fare was truly astounding.  Marc takes his job seriously, and it shows.    After a few minutes of discussion we chose a few starters: Pulpo (octopus), the Vittore Carpaccio, Geoduck (clam) and the Kushi Oysters.  Each was distinctive and worth the coin.    The Pulpo:   Fresh and perfectly cooked, not rubbery or mushy.  The sauce was light and very flavorful but not overpowering.   Serving size was a small plate enough for two or three people.  The Vittore Carpaccio:  Served ice cold on a cold plate was sliced razor thin with hard cheese slivers, capers and light oil.  A real excellent dish for two, the meat melts in your mouth and the cheese is robust.    The Geoduck:  Uniquely flavored and refreshing a good size for two people was served with an excellent sauce that was possibly cream based.  Good dish for someone who enjoys a seafood experience.  The Kushi Oysters:   Amazingly fresh for being in the middle of a desert wasteland that is Vegas.  The in-house vinaigrette and cocktail sauce was excellent.  These really were my favorite...you can't go wrong with fresh oysters.   The main dish HAD to be the rib eye steak.  I discussed with Marc about my particular tastes in red meat and he made two recommendations the Mishima reserve and the Lindsay Ranch.  I really wanted a steak that required no seasoning and had a powerful flavor.  Marc pointed me towards the dry aged Lindsay cut and I decided to take the plunge.  Asking for a medium cooking was the right choice as well.  The rib eye arrived hot and perfect...red in the center with plenty of marbling present.  The portion would be good for two hungry Americans or three from anywhere else in the world.  Flavor was amazing; didn't need anything and stood alone as the best steak I have ever been served.   After this truly serious gastronomic adventure Marc hooked us up with liquid nitrogen frozen cocktail that I really can't remember the name of.  It was sweet, potent and made right at our table, an excellent ending.  Unfortunately, we didn't leave any space for dessert...we were stuffed.  I really wanted to try something as it seemed the pastry chefs were working hard in the kitchen just a few feet away.  This meal wouldn't have been half as enjoyable without the direction of our amazing server Marc.  Hat Tip to you dude, best meal I have ever had.",

I went to Bazaar Meat last week while in Las Vegas for a convention and took a group of clients there for dinner. The whole experience was phenomenal, from the food to the service. The ambiance was great for a client dinner--bustling enough to make the evening lively but the noise level was reasonable enough to have good conversation. We all had the tasting menu, which I would highly recommend. Every dish was unique and beyond delicious. Try to get Tony Ortega-Perez as your Bazaar Meat Captain. He made the whole experience memorable and took great care of us. Make sure to bring your appetite! Thanks Bazaar Meat for the fantastic evening!",

Service was outstanding. He was opinionated but pushy in the right way and the recommendations were spot on. Best service I've had since I can remember.  The food also was a hit, the tomato bread is a must.  As is the cotton candy foie gras. A5 Kobe ounce portion was bigger than I thought. Its not pricey for a Vegas steakhouse. I'll be back.",

Going back the 2nd time, i was compelled to try the banner ribeye and while delicious I couldn't get over the price relative to taste.  it just may be that i can't taste the difference between high-quality ribeye and a pretty good ribeye from somewhere like the arroyo chophouse in pasadena.  all in, i did it and enjoyed it, but it certainly hurt the wallet and can't be viewed a value proposition even after considering the novelty factor.",

The ambiance was fabulous and the service was top notch - our server Oscar was kind and attentive, and very knowledgeable about the food.  It's a very expensive place but it's absolutely worth it. We wanted to try a bit of everything on the menu rather than buying the big ticket items. We started with the Cotton Candy Foie Gras which was an absolute dream. Next, we had the Vittore 1950 Carpaccio - which was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever eaten. Our third dish was the Classic Beef Tartare which came with these amazing home baked rolls - really delicious. To end the main part of the meal we had the skirt steak with rosemary mustard.   My husband loves vanilla ice cream, so we ordered the Vanilla Ice Cream Experience - which was truly amazing. I won't ruin the surprise by describing what it was, but definitely worth it. We then had the Bacon Strawberry Cream pastry and the Salted Caramel Candies.  All in all, this place was incredible. We've already made plans to go to Bazaar in Los Angeles for my birthday. Highly recommended!",

I decided to write a review because this was probably the best meal I've had in a long long time... and trust me not only am I a picky eater but we have eaten in multiple famous restaurants all around the world...  this restaurant is remarkable... I may not be a huge fan of famous celebrity chefs but this restaurant verifies the fame of Jose Andres... from the way it is set up on the back of the hotel without the casino traffic and the decoration to the position of the kitchen and the grill and the seafood area... everything is extremely well thought out and works perfectly... then the staff is what makes this place awesome... the polite and helpful hostesses, the knowledgeable and non-stop moving waiters and the great grillers... and above all the most knowledgeable, polite and efficient manager we've ever encountered... he greeted us himself as returning customers and stopped by our table multiple times to make sure everything is ok and to give us recommendations and suggestions... this guy is so knowledgeable of his restaurant and knows everything from where the meat comes from to the exact temperature and the way it's cooked all they to how and for how long the meats have been cured and even how they taste and which wine they should be paired with... he is a great asset to the restaurant and makes the experience so much better... last but not least the food... we've never had anything short of remarkable... the cured meats plate was both times amazing, the suckling pig should not be missed, the ribeye that was cooked to the perfect temperature over 50 min and still came medium rare to the unbelievable side dishes especially the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms... a few more suggestions: the beef as well as the salmon carpaccio were perfect, the foie gras Cotton candy was fun  and tasty and the crudo should not be missed. Small suggestion would be a little bit the seasoning... this time around we had to ask for salt in order to supplement the seasoning... minor complaint but since we are aiming at a perfect score it should be noted... Overall this place should not be missed by anyone who visits Vegas and wants an unbelievable meal!!! Congratulations to the whole team!!!",

But you can't let that stop you from trying this place! Be prepared to spend $ and just go! Keep in mind that is it tapas so the portions are smaller, but that's how you get to try so many of the delicious items on their menu.  For starters we had the gigantic chicharron (it really was huge!), the Reuben sandwiches (different and delicious), the cotton candy fois gras (you just have to get it) and the bison buffalo style carpaccio (tasty!). For dinner we shared the Chateaubriand and it was literally the best steak I've ever had! Super tender and flavorful. We also got the Lucias salad and the Robuchon potatoes (buttery heaven!). The food here is literally edible art. Can't wait to go back! Oh... And Patrick was amazing",

Not knowing what to expect when we made the reservation, my date and I made a commitment to try as many things as we could. Enter our excellent server, Chris, and the tasting menu. We started with magical drinks, served table side. A mojito with cotton candy, and a lemon cocktail made with liquid nitrogen and served with a spoon! Did I mention the decor? Whimsical and fun. Loved the chairs with the sunglass wearing animals, and the crocodile head wall ornaments.  Then, there was the food. So much food! Chris took care of us, throwing a few extras in with our already out of this world menu, including their aged ham which is something everyone should try at some point in their life. Every plate was beautiful, every bite was delicious and perfectly balanced, the timing (considering they have 5 kitchens), was perfect. I highly recommend trying this place out, and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I was deciding between a 3 or a 4 but I've decided to give this place a 4. I think considering their quality of their meat products, I had to give it a 4. However, I would suggest you to only come in a party of 2-4 people or else you are just gonna be spending a lot and not getting full.   The wagyu tartare was okay. It's probably the 2nd best I've had but still not comparable to the one I have at Craft Steak. The butter over butter over butter potato puree: ohh goodness, heart attack. It was like a fluff of cloud that you can just sleep on. Might be the best and deadliest potato puree I've had. I would like that plate to leave it spotless. Our waiter kept insisting we ordered the 1/4 pig and I think he might have overhyped it a bit too much. Yes, it was outstanding quality bc man they did cook it w/ perfection but it's like a roasted pig you would get at Asian restaurant where you paid 1/4 of the price. The skin was exactly like it but the meat were 8x better. I didn't know you can make a pork so juicy. However, I wouldn't recommend it. It was expensive and a lot of it were bones.  The beef rib steak was literally top-notch quality. I had absolutely no problem eating the fat cause the meat was that great. Something you put in your mouth, and you didn't have to chew. They don't try to fancy you in anyway with their cooking method, they want you to taste their quality of the meat.  Cauliflowers were also really good. Very meaty and the lemon went well w/ it.  As I said, I really recommend coming w/ a small party. I wasn't anywhere near full. Oh the thing that bugged me the most about this place was the wait for the pig and the steak. I think we waited an hour for it and that was the thing that bugged me about this place.   Expect to pay a lot, it's definitely fine-dining.",

If there is a weak spot in the tasting menu, it is the crisp potato pillows. I believe they would be better with some sort of filling, or omitted in favor of something more interesting. The lox and cream cheese cones are out of this world. One tiny piece of perfection. The desserts included in the tasting menu were a touch lackluster- I don't negate stars for this because I came for the meat. The other items in the tasting menu were stellar. Be aware a party of two must order the same tasting menu. I suppose this means we must go back to try the other two menus. ;) The service was incredibly attentive. I recommend the nitro lemon drink in the featured cocktail list. It's a fun tableside presentation. The quantity is not huge but the nitro lemon concoction is fabulous. With tip, we ended up at around 350.00. Money well spent for an other worldly experience. Pro tip from our amazing server: If you want to try the pig, reserve a quarter/half etc when you make your reservation. They run out quickly.",

    "text": "This is a real oddball place with some very good elements, some very weird, and unevenly trained staff.  Let me start by saying the steak is exquisite, perfectly aged, among the best I've ever had.  It's a nice room.  With that in mind, they had to work really hard to earn anything less than a 4 or 5 star review from me.  But, unfortunately there were a slew of negatives, for instance:  1) They were out of 70% of the menu items I attempted to order (if not the dish itself, a key component of the dish.)  For instance, after looking at the menu online I was dying to try the morcilla with sea urchin.  Guess what?  No sea urchin.  No prawns either.  (I can actually understand that to some extent: if you want things to be super-fresh, and you're nowhere near the ocean, you may be out of seafood items from time-to-time, even quite frequently.)  Still, when I tried to order a side and was told \"that's out of season\" I wonder why it's even on the menu, unless for some twisted reason the chef wants his diners to experience disappointment. 2) While our waiter was extremely professional, helpful and competent, some of the runners were not adequately trained.  For instance, after the waiter had talked us into sampling the West Coast oysters, the runner showed up at our table and announced: \"Here are your East Coast oysters.\"  When we said we thought we'd ordered West Coast oysters she said: \"No.  They're from the East Coast.  British Columbia.\"  There were other, similar blunders. 3) Even though the place was half empty, and we had a reservation, we were made to wait. 4) All the mains are cooked very very slowly, for a very long time.  The result is excellent; not suggesting they change that, just that it creates a very odd atmosphere to be sitting for a very long time after your appetizers with nothing but empty clean plates in front of you, and you look around and everybody around you is sitting at tables with empty clean plates in front of them.  At least serve bread or something.  One other thing worth mentioning: this is not a good option for a solo business traveler.  Although it looks like from their online menu you can order steak by the pound, you really can't.  (Like you can't say \"I want a 1 lb. steak\" I don't think.)  They are bigger and meant to be shared.",

It's hard to put into words what a unique and innovative dining experience this is. The combination of ingredients and flavors packaged in a fun and playful way proved to be delicious perfection even to the pickiest of the eaters in our group.  Our culinary journey, where each bite was better than the next, was enhanced  by our server/ tour guide Tony. His welcoming and fun spirit were second only to his depth of knowledge of the menu and commitment to fulfilling Bazaar's culinary mission.  Tony spent time getting to know us in order to recommend the most perfect combination of small plates, meat entrees, dessert selections and of course libations.  Highlights included the croquettes, the beefsteak tomato tartar and Japanese Kobe A5 prepared at the table on a grilling stone (worth every penny - complete with certificate of authenticity) with a side of magic mojitos and salt air margaritas.  We cannot wait to return next year (sorry Tony we're coming back !). Do yourself a favor and reserve a table with Tony to make your next Vegas stay memorable.",

The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that for once, the server didn't act like we were privileged to be dining there like they do all ALL the SBE restaurants in LA. She was actually friendly and nice, not snooty.  First, I called for a reservation 10 days in advance after seeing nothing available on the day we wanted (Friday 9/5) on Open Table. The girl on the phone said nothing was available until Tuesday 9/9. A few days later, I looked on Open Table and 8pm on Friday was available so I booked it.  We get there on time and the place is 70% empty. I wonder if they just keep spaces open for walk-ins, yet they don't tell you that on the phone when you try to make a reservation. The place stayed empty until about 10pm when we left.  We ordered the foie gras cotton candy, chicken croquettes, beef Carpaccio with parmesan, peanut fed serrano ham, flat iron steak with blue cheese, baby corn,  and Anna potatoes.  The foie gras, croquettes, carpaccio, and ham were good, not amazing. The flat iron steak was bland, the anna potatoes were so saltly, they were inedible. I sent them back and they still came back covered in salt. They forgot the baby corn and the steak took so long, they sent out a free gazpacho, but that wasn't good either. I didn't realize that they forgot the baby corn until hours later, but at least they didn't charge us for it.  Bottom line, go to Animal or Bestia in LA. You'll save a hundred dollars and have much better, creative dishes.",

This steak had a crust so marvelous I couldn't believe it yet there wasn't the slightest hint of a charred or burnt flavor. I will now be on a probably endless search for the method they use to crust the steak. The potatoes were excellent, the sprouts were good, our waitress was fantastic!

They offer very few Side dishes, which leaves you with a nice meat sweat afterwards from eating only meat.  The service was slow and rude.  Certainly not what you want when taking a date along.  I would not recommend.",

    "text": "First time staying at the sls las Vegas and my first time at bazaar meat. I was pretty excited to try it especially after reading all the great things about it. My boyfriend and I decided to skip the tasting menus in favor of ordering what we wanted and we were not at all disappointed. For starters we got the cured pork and it was crazy good. The fatty parts melted in your mouth! Next was the suckling pig which is what were most looking forward to. Its expensive but totally worth it. I feel like I've never tasted pork until I tried that. It was PERFECTION. We also tried the mashed potatoes and grilled baby corn which was amazing but the suckling pig was the star of that meal. Also try the craft cocktails! The Hemingway was soooo good! Can't wAit to go back to Vegas and try it again! Amazing service, great ambiance, and even better food!",

I make a better one at home. Asked for medium rare got medium. Potatoes and asparagus were amazing.  It was out wedding day so got a free shot at the end which works for me.  Not sure if I would come back.  Atmosphere was interesting.",

    "text": "We were visiting from New York and got sucked into doing the tasting menu.  First of all, it is an insane amount of food (and price) for two people.  It was definitely an experience and I'm glad we got to taste all the highlights, but it's pretty gluttonous.   If I had to go back I would just order the Lindsay Ranch Washugyu/Angus beef---which was melt-in-your-mouth incredible.  The vegetables were also amazing.  As others have said--the carrots and the asparagus were delicious.  The starter that really stood out to me was the Wagyu carpaccio parmesan sticks...they are a must-order. The things that detract from making this a five-star experience are definitely the service and the drinks.  I don't mind a laid-back server, but it seemed not to match the $600+ price tag.  Also the drinks were unimpressive: the cotton candy mojito was an awesome concept but the taste was just okay.  My nebbiolo wasn't a great wine either.  But it's definitely worth a special occasion splurge for the food.",

They also have a wine room where they do wine tastings for the table.   The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the desserts because they were tiny but they were still delicious!",

    "text": "What a fun place and so accommodating for large parties! Definitely need to make reservations, this restaurant is huge but don't chance it. The service is really great however I hate to say it, the meat was my least favorite part. We tried this place for restaurant week and the restaurant was packed, but I feel that it shouldn't compromise the meal. The food was taking an extra long time and so we had a glass of wine on the house but we ran into a group of friends that were comped the same thing so it was probably a rough night. Our steak ended up on the cold side and really chewy. But on to my favorites, the cotton candy foie gras was such a unique taste I loved it. The buttered potato puree was my very favorite but be warned it's extremely rich and creamy so a little goes a long way. Our table really loved the button mushrooms too. The dessert has little bites of chocolate so it was difficult to share but there was lots of variety. A fun environment that's worth a try but no strong desire to come back and do it again.",

We came here as a party of 9 and they sat us in a semi-private room (you can draw the curtains to make it private). A great place to share a slab of beef,  1/4 suckling pig, a couple of lobsters, a whole bunch of appetizers, and a couple bottles of wine for a very reasonable fine-dining price. We were all pretty full too! Make sure you tell the staff in advance that you have a limited amount of time (in our case we wanted to be out in less than 2 hours) and they will accommodate you.",

From bottom to top(capers, sweet onion, chives, eggs whites, egg yolk, rainbow trout, tsar imperial siberian, imperial osetra caviar. 4. Abalone with dashi jelly and rainbow trout caviar. 5.

    "text": "In Vegas for a long weekend to relax/enjoy with the wifey.  I'm always a little tardy with my reviews if I write at all, but thought lets get this one published soon given the culinary adventure we just experienced.  Decided to visit Vegas mainly for two reasons, continue our track of best hotels in the world (Mandarin Oriental) and two, try some of the best chef's in the world restaurants.  I actually had not heard about this place until recently and almost didn't book since my wife is not a red meat eater.  I'm so glad I did.  The restaurant is in the remodeled Sahara which is the old part of the strip.  The restaurant is on the first floor in the back and is large and decorated in an expensive lodge motif, earthy and woody.  The kitchen is long and open and you can see, smell and fell the heat of the spit pits and grills.  We arrived early for our 7:30 pm reservation and were seated promptly.  Good table, not great as it appeared they filed the restaurant from front to back - I guess to give the look it was full.  When we left at 9:30 pm the dining room was maybe a little more than half full.  Now for the food.  The tasting menus are for 2 or more and have mostly beef so I couldn't try since my wife doesn't eat red meat.  Bitter green salad with a lemon vinegar dressing was outstanding, the grilled oysters were fresh but lacked any real grilled flavor so this was the only shortfall of the meal.  Their spin on Caesar Salad was ridiculously good.  My wife is a very picky eater and cooks crazy food at home so when she says this was the best salmon or fish dish ever it means something.  Salmon cooked in parchment with olives, raisins, onions and sage was sublime.  My meat was the veal chop and it was outstanding too. The cauliflower steak was the best I've had and this is one of my favorite veggies so we have often.  The last side were mashed potatoes, yes I said mashed potatoes.  This ain't you mama's recipe.  Silky, smooth and you can taste the potato with butter butter butter, crazy good.  Let's summarize, location not the best but great restaurant ambience, service was excellent and what you expect anytime you drop more than $100 per person, ultra expensive but go the tasting menu route if possible, good wine list but always hard for me to give kudos on wine because markup is so high, top notch food and in our top 10 all-time. Only 4 stars as the tasty menus should have at least a fish or chicken option and none of the food comes out together.  While this is explained, I still like a traditional dining experience.",

    "text": "The concept of this restaurant alone, gives it a 5 star review. Its like no other restaurant I have been to. It fits perfectly for Vegas. It's big, its energetic, its exciting, whichever way you look you are amazed at what you see. From the showcase of the meats, to the open kitchen, to the decor right down to the execution of service. The whole place epitomizes talent.  If you are familiar with chef Jose Andres, then you know he redefines food. He is all about that molecular gastronomy.  He literally breaks down food and reinvents it, with his own spin on it. Try the modern day olives...I'm not quite sure how to define the aftermath of eating one. Its a burst of olive amazingness that leaves you wondering, 'how the hell did he do that?!'  The menu is nothing short of variety...so many options, all meant to be tasted and shared. I like the concept of small bites. You get to try numerous things rather than filling up on one specific dish. They hand selected specific farms for their meat selection, which to me, gives me a sense of comfort. How many other steakhouses let alone restaurants can give you a history on where the meat you are eating came from?! It gives you a sense of intellect that these guys know what they are doing. So if you do come across a dish you aren't so happy with, there's plenty more to compensate for your distaste. And even better is the management team is right there making sure you are being taken care of.  I could go on and on...but give it a try for yourself. Again, its not just the food, its an experience.  Enjoy!!!!",

    "text": "second visit, pretty busy on a Saturday night had to get seats at table in bar area  decided against my better judgement to give the cotton candy foie gras and foieffle a second try....should have stuck with my gut feeling, they weren't any better this time around....I do appreciate sweet and savory, but think foie needs to be seared to truly bring out the best in it. Same with the foieffle, a bit on the salty side, may be better made with unsalted peanut butter?  We had the ribeye again, and were not disappointed, they do know how to prepare a great steak, I have to give them that! of course we had to order the Robuchon potatoes, can't pass up the butter! tried the brussell sprouts, which were good, but lemon foam a bit strong  would suggest ordering dessert al la carte, as we picked the 10 piece? selection, which they put together for us again, steak is their forte, so the sweets seemed to be an afterthought  all in all, this is not a bad place, probably needs a bit more time to refine the menu if you live in vegas, would probably say their are a number of better choices for a steakhouse off strip. this one is worth a try though.....",

He was also great with our four year old, who attended dinner with us - he brought him one of the specialty sloppy joes and interacted with him so well throughout the course of the meal. As a finisher, Anthony continued to go above and beyond, bringing us a dessert sampler that was absolutely decadent. While the restaurant experience would have been amazing in itself, Anthony truly made it a special night for us and we are SO thankful. This gentleman is amazing at his job and is a great asset to this restaurant. Bravo to the chefs at Bazaar Meats & Anthony! We will surely be back.",

Beef tartare was the best dish we had but unfortunately it was the appetizer. They have small rolls cut to make tartare sliders. We ordered also the carpaccio but it was ok. The salad was presented in a very strange confusing manner. They pulled the romaine lettuce leaves and stuck the stems in ice so the leaves stood up like quills. Then with your hands you dipped it in the salad dressing on the side. The suckling pig is their signature entree. Again ok. I think they need to spend less time focusing on the pomp and presentation and more time on the flavor. Check out China Poplano at the Cosmo, another Jose Andres property but the food is flavorful and fun and the foam maragarita refreshing.",

See other posts...  We knew we were in for a treat here.  Please pace yourself with the amount of dishes you order as this is a lot of meat so items are a little heavier even for small plates.  The server will tell you to order more of course, but you can always add later!    We shared everything and started with the Chef's choice charcuterie platter (really could share with 3 or 4 people), the tomato bread (so addicted to this as they also serve it at Jaleo), then the paella with pork short rib (daily special and this could really be one entree but they consider it an app! soooo delicious, the meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly with some crunch on the outside and tender fall off the bone meat, and the rice is really made from pasta but still has that crust on the top....my mouth is watering...  Then we had the bone on strip loin.  (so much better than it sounds on the menu.  I was afraid of the miso mustard, but it's served on the side and doesn't take away from the flavor of the meat.  The meat was so tender and melt in your mouth.  We couldn't finish it.  The sides were Robuchon mashed potatoes (check your cholesterol goodness) and the brussel sprout petals (more like a salad than warm side but really good).  We were too full for dessert so we have to come back!  awww.... The drinks were creative and so worth it. The wine list is reasonable and you can't have a bad pick.  The dinner was expensive but we were so happy and felt it was well worth the prices.  Our server was awesome!  I can't wait to come back!!!",

For entree we got the wagyu/ angus rib steak (so amazingly flavorful and tender) and rack of lamb (I wasn't too excited about it. Too raw cooked for me.) side dishes we selected the shoe string potatoes (can't go wrong with that), asparagus (which was simply grilled), and the Brussels sprouts (which was toss in a vinaigrette.) overall service, and the meal was great.

Nice atmosphere, very noisy - we ordered Tuna steak, a rib steak (2-3 lbs) and 9-11 lb suckling pig, along with a large variety of appetizers. The food was excellent but not overwhelming - at least for $1200 (and limited alcohol consumption). The suckling pig was excellent, steak was okay (I've had better at Morton's, Delmonico's, Prime, - you get the picture). However, some of the appetizers (especially seafood) were outstanding - for instance the sea urchin (uni) was incredibly fresh, Desserts were nice but again not spectacular - there was a bit of a gimmick with sniffing vanilla bean, coffee bean and rum with a serving of vanilla ice cream that I wasn't overly impressed with. I'd go back once in a while - but it's not my favourite.",

    "text": "Good food, Slowest service ever. Our server was really nice and ended up compensating us with desserts. I ordered the andive salad and the rebouchon mash potatoes. It took them, I am not exaggerating, more than an hour to bring the andive salad. It's just a salad. After an hour and a half they brought all the meat to the tables, and still did not bring me the mash potatoes. Basically I only got my food an hour and a half after sitting. Also they gave us the table 10 min late, which I wouldn't think about too much if the entire experience was good. The salad and mash potatoes were excellent. My friends said the meats were good too. I liked his other restaurant, Jaleo, better and will go there next time.",

    "text": "This was the worst experience of my life. Exactly one year ago I was attending a trade show and stayed at the hotel where Bazaar Meat is located. I went with two other business associates. I was not hungry so shared a Salmon Tatar with my Associate. That night my Associate started to feel sick. I started to feel sick the next day. This was a Wednesday. By Saturday we both ended up in the hospital in Montreal where we live. Extreme food poisoning and colitis. We were so dehydrated. When I got better the following week I called the restaurant who said a manager would call me back. Never happened. I called back following week and they said manager had my name and would call and never did. I only wanted an apology and to warn them that this should not happen to other people sine two people landed in the hospital. My friends told me to call again but could not bother as they clearly did not want to call me or hear what happened. This is being written because my friends told me to download Yelp and at least warn other people about the horrible experience but more important how they would not even call two customers who ended up in the hospital.",

The croquetas de pollo were amazing. Nice crust, and warm perfect middle. My gf loved the cotton candy foie gras. We both agree the beef cheek was the best thing we had eaten in recent memory, I would go back just for the beef cheek  incredible experience, and absolute must in Vegas.",

I've had the beef cheeks and the Harrison ribeye and all are phenomenal. Definitely a unique dining experience. Let the server guide your meal... You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "This was one of the best meals I have had \"ever\" as well as one of the most expensive.  There were six of us at dinner and we ordered a variety of different items to taste (tapas style) then we each ordered an entree.  There are four or five different kitchens in the restaurant each with its own purpose (ie - one only cooks meat, etc).  We started with several orders of Croquestas de Pollo (I have to warn you these are addicting), Gazpacho Shots, and Grilled Asparagus.  This was followed by a Brussel Sprout salad, Beef and Parmesan Grissini, and the Harris Ranch Angus.  Everything was absolutely amazing, there was not one item I didn't love.  My only warning to someone that is going there for the first time is to make sure you are aware the big cuts of steak are priced per pound, not per plate.  If you look at the meat case before you order you will get a sense of how big the pieces of meat are.  They are absolutely huge.  My steak was big enough to feed three hungry adults, so my girlfriend and I shared it and left with about half of it still intact.  I don't go to Vegas often as I used to, but I will be back here next time I am there for sure.  The food is just incredible.",

I ordered washugyu three pounds and its 98 dollars a pound. Then i ordered three types of wagyu which is i believe 50 per ounce and i got 6 which melts in your mouth!!!!!! Then cotton candy foie gras also some caviars which arrived after  my meats which is stupid! Kinda got upset but whatever, im here to have fun. No bad vibes!!! My server didnt really attended to us that much which i like but one of the food runners acted like hes our server which is very nice!!! Maybe they are short handed lol! Come on bazaar meat.. we pay thousands for food drinks and service. Make sure u have extra help if someone called jn sick coz they are hangover to work. :)  all in all its really good!

    "text": "Bazaar Meat may be the best meal that I have had yet in Vegas.  I came here on a Wednesday night last week without reservations.  The hostess was very nice and said that if we wanted to have a drink at the bar, she would try to sneak us into a table.  I was eating with my coworker, Mr. Riches.  Luckily, because itwas just two of us, she was able to get us a seat after about 20 minutes.  We ordered a handful of items between the two of us.  Mr. Riches and myself started with the foie gras wrapped in cotton candy.  It was outrageously amazing.  Other highlights included the rib eye, the tartar, and the braised lamb neck.  We originally did order the suckling pig, but after about an hour, our waiter told us that they were out of it.  At first we were quite upset, but they did make up for it by bringing some croquettes, and cauliflower steak for free.  In addition, in the middle of the course, the waiter made some rum sorbet with liquid nitrogen that was just outrageous.  I don't think that this is normally free, but it was just a great surprise.  In the middle of dinner, I also looked behind me, and saw that Mr. Jose Andres was sitting there himself eating.  I looked at what he was having, and it was suckling Pig!!!  I joked that Jose took the last of the suckling pig.  The waiter assured me that he didn't, but I still bet he did :-).  Regardless, I felt as though the restaurant made up for it, and it will be a reason to return.  I do wish that Jose made his round around the tables so I could have gotten a picture.  Instead, he just quietly sneaked in and sneaked out.  Overall, this was a great meal, and I can hardly wait to go back!",

    "text": "I've dined at 'fine dining' establishments before. I've been whisked away on culinary adventures in Chicago, Anchorage, Seattle, and Honolulu. I know that, sometimes, spending $200 on a meal means I'm going to be given an experience worth having. Bazaar Meats is widely advertised throughout Vegas- with signs along the Boulevard every few blocks. Even our cab driver recommended it as a place to go. What isn't openly disclosed is the price, the ambiance, or the odd table service. 'Bazaar Meats' should actually be called 'Bizarre Meats', because that's the experience I had here.  My parents and fiance visited this place with high hopes. A nice dinner- hopefully with some very good steak choices. Disclaimer here; this place is classy. It's upscale, but there is no dress code. So you have the Midwest couple to the left in a t-shirt and jeans, and the older East Coast couple to the right in almost formal attire. There's business, business casual, cocktail-wearing bachelorettes, and formal here. There's also a few random casual people who somehow found their way in. The low lighting, formal-sporting waiters, and request for reservations at the front indicate this place wants its customers to dress nice. They don't enforce that rule, though, which really makes this place seem a lot less 'fancy' than they're trying to be. As a disclaimer, we didn't know how to dress- and my parents were the Midwest couple in casual attire. I'm not judging people who go here in casual wear- I'm saying this place doesn't adequately advertise itself for the ambiance it seems to want to create.  We were promptly served water and our waiter handed us four GINORMOUS menus. We were each handed a glass framed menu measuring approximately 16 inches in length. This thing was obnoxiously large, heavy, and hard to read. The lighting here is low (which creates a very romantic atmosphere), but the frame on the menu reflects the lighting, making it hard to read. The writing is also very small- so be ready to squint. This wouldn't be an issue if the glass cover wasn't reflecting the light as well.   The waiter then began to describe the dining process. They do 'shared plates' here- which, again, is something they don't ever advertise- so you're just kind of thrown into this weird culinary experience upon walking in. You order a series of meat dishes to share with everyone at the table. One person does not receive their own steak. You order a selection of 2 to 4 steaks and everyone at the table gets a small bite. Steaks are priced by the ounce, and each 'serving of steak' costs between $30 and $140. There are also a few token seafood and poultry dishes. Want a salad? That's an additional $17. I've had upscale. I know the flavors. This salad was disgusting. A few random 'gourmet' leaves with lemon squeezed on top. No seriously, that's the salad. Avoid it.   We ordered a steak (which, to be honest, I don't remember which one- it was around $80) and the chicken. This is what the waiter suggested. Between four people we got to share one steak and four pieces of chicken. The chicken was bland- barely seasoned. Supposedly it was some prestigious chicken from Europe- but a little bit of garlic, or parsley, or sage would have went a long way on those drumsticks. We ordered the steak medium rare and it came rare. With that being said we all liked rare, and agreed that it was a very well cooked steak. Barely seasoned with blackened edges and a soft warm interior. Again- it didn't come the way we ordered it, but it tasted great. The mustard sauce it was paired with was less than thriller.   As a side we ordered mashed potatoes. It should have been called 'overly buttered potatoes', because according to my taste buds, butter was the only thing it was paired with. I would have been happier with truffles or onion or something- but no, this 'gourmet' restaurant decided that butter was the ideal ingredient to mix in, and left it at that.   Our total with the tip was around $240. None of us left feeling satisfied- and it wasn't because we didn't get enough to eat. It's because the food wasn't rich or even remotely worth the price. The only thing that made this place unique was the way the food was served. I could have gotten a better seasoned chicken at Olive Garden. And our waiter? He could have cared less when we expressed dissatisfaction with the food- exclaiming that it was 'healthy' and pointing out all of the extravagant foreign farms the meats had come from.   I don't know- maybe some people enjoy spending hundreds of dollars on \"bizarre\" meats. Personally, I'm not one of those people, and the rest of my visits to Vegas will not include this establishment on my schedule.",

Everything that we had was amazing. Got sent some complimentary Cotton Candy w/ Foie Gras and that was the kick to a wonderful start. Then we went with the mini Foie Gras soup, tacos (Iberico Ham with smelt egg wrapped in seaweed), Bison Carpaccio (so tender topped with celery and blue cheese) and the Live Uni (probably the freshest I've tasted here in Vegas) for appetizers. All so amazing.  The Uni was so good that we had to try the Live Uni (again) on top of Blood Sausage and THAT was divine. For entrees we decided to split the steak that was half wagyu and half angus (honestly forgot what it's called but it was too interesting to pass up) and the Suckling Pig Sandwich that was bursting with fatty flavor in each and every bite. I seriously have dreams about it. For sides we had the Baby Corn that was topped with popcorn dust. That didn't disappoint as well.  Felt a bit more adventurous and ordered the Beer Tartare that was done table side and was very fresh and flavorful to the palate to balance out the fattyness from the previous sandwich. Seriously. I hope everyone orders this.  On top of that, both my cocktails were done table side. The Cotton Candy Mojito consisted of an actual cotton candy fluff sitting on top of a martini glass then later diffused into liquid while pouring the liquor onto it. The Don't Be A Lemon was done with liquid nitrogen causing smokey sensations for necks to be turned throughout the restaurant. What an experience.   And since it was my birthday, they were generous enough to send a birthday box full of different desserts in them- all were so good and nothing short of ordinary.   Overall my experience is worthy of telling anyone to try to book a reservation at Bazaar for whatever reason. Don't pass this place up. It'll be sure to deliver towards your expectations 100%.",

The bar offers MANY excellent selections at great prices...including the pork sandwich (a MUST) that they don't serve in the restaurant!  Every thing, including the red wine of the day ( a lovely tempernillo), was exquisitely prepared and amazing from the first bite.  The crispy pork (with yogurt sauce) is a must if you are with a group or are part of a couple - I found it too much (a GOOD thing for a bar portion, let me tell you) for just moi given the other things to get, though it was delicious and not greasy or overly \"salty\".  The manager personally came over...I mean, this is how dining should be.  The atmosphere is amazing and as others have said, yes, PERFECT for a date or more intimate meeting.  For anyone balking at the (reasonable for the quality to be sure) prices for the dinner, dinner...take advantage of the bar and order everything that sounds good and at least one thing you are on the fence about.  You will not be disappointed.  May I go back now?  Thank you, Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, for making a very hard week and birthday celebration for one absolutely outstanding.",

We didn't order any drinks and we are not big eaters.  We got the lobster, 6 oz Kobe beef, 1/4 pig, and a few sides/apps, and shared everything family style.   The worst thing we got was the beef consomme which was inedible because it was extremely salty.  It was saltier than drinking full-sodium soy sauce.  We sent the dish back. Server said he will gave us a new one, but never did and still charged us for it.  I had to tell the server about the charge and he took it off.   The best thing about here is the service.  They were nice about it that we had an infant with us.  Several staff even came to say hi to my infant son. Some steakhouse in Vegas won't take our reservation because we had an infant.  I also appreciate that they didn't pressure us to get drinks or gave us attitude about it.   Lobster, Kobe steak, and Roast Pig were all delicious but not mind-blowing.  I remember Kobe beef in Kyoto was more fatty/melt in your mouth than at this restaurant.    I had a higher expectation that this restaurant will serve mind-blowing flavors because of the cost.  You'll have an enjoyable meal here but it just not worth the price.",

Highlights:  Pork skin with dipping sauce, grilled baby corn, skirt steak, carpaccio, creamy mashed potatoes.

Didn't give us a drink menu right away, sat there looking stupid because we didn't even get any recommendations all he said was \"it's good\" he was French I presumed with an accent.    We started with the beef carpaccio with the Parmesan sticks? It was good, but the sauce served with it was very salty. Tuna carpaccio was OK with a strong anchovy dressing.    Entrees: the Spanish seasoned rib eye was Yummy but did take an hour to arrive (he did mention to us that it would). The PULPO was my favorite (grilled octopus) just the way I remembered when in Barcelona. The side dishes sucked!! We sent back the babycorn with the popcorn season? Was too salty, the sweet red peppers also over seasoned, I guess the Delmonico potatoes were the best!    I will not return, if you want a good steakhouse try Jean George's at ARIA",

It is quite pricey to eat here, but worth every penny.  I had the octopus and it is the best octopus I had ever had.  We shared some sides with the table, their mashed potatoes are out of this world, their desserts were incredible.  We didn't get the chance to have the suckling pig, but we will definitely plan that for our next trip to Vegas.  My husband had the rib eye and it was so delicious.  Everything was superb, but mostly, the service, the service was phenomenal.  After we had to tell the manager how amazing everything was and he thanked us and took us on a quick tour of the restaurant, and took the time to explain some things to us, like how the shave the ham, how they organize their seafood.  It just made us appreciate our experience even more.  LOVED THIS PLACE and will definitely eat here again.

    "text": "Another Jose Andres restaurant to add to my food journal.   When this restaurant first opened I was not impressed with what was suggested to me. I was definitely reluctant to go again however a friend of mine said I should give it one more try. Glad I did because this time it was on point.  First off if you are an animal lover/activist or even Vegetarian go far far away from this place because it is not a pretty picture with all the meats everywhere.   There are different cook stations to view and different kinds of booths and tables. Also one big communal table if you are okay with sharing.   The two things I would come back in a heartbeat are the classic steak tartare and the Robuchon potatoes. OMG talk about decadence. So bad but oh so good for you. The tartare is mixed for you and served with bread in a wonderful presentation. It was explained that it is best eaten like a slider but honestly I ate it just like Cookie Monster would eat his cookie. The potatoes were whipped to perfection. You think oh it's just mash potatoes but this is mash potatoes from the clouds.   I have also tried the tenderloin which was cooked very nicely and a LOT of meat and we needed veggies so we had the carrots. I am still a eh person when it comes to foie gras so the Cotton candy foie gras was oooook. The croquetas were fine but ok which is weird cause I usually love croquetas. Oh and I forgot to mention my drink, I got a passion fruit cocktail and it was nice and sweet tart if you like that taste.   I have a massive sweet tooth so I love when I still have a little room for dessert. And I mean little cause their selections are bite sized. Perfect way to end your night. I enjoyed my cream puff cause I wanted something classic but my guests enjoyed the chocolate rum cake. If I didn't feel so full I would have had at least 5 cause the size is just so petite.   What I would say about this restaurant is that you should go if you are indefinitely a meat lover. Also make reservations since it is their busiest restaurant in SLS and just share and enjoy. Depends on my mood if I want to do tapas but now I know what my go to dishes are should I be in the area again.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I don't eat beef or pork. When you walk in you are greeted by counters of marbled meat and dead piglets hung by their feet. I didn't expect anything less, I knew what I was getting myself into.  It was my husbands 31st birthday and we were here for the certified Japanese wagyu- grade A5  We frequent Japan just to go eat for a few weeks so when we heard we had a legit supplier in town I just knew I had to get my husband and my Japanese gma in here.   THIS PLACE IS NOT CHEAP... but it is cheaper than flying to Japan.  Service is impeccable. Decor is odd, calming, amazing,and fun all at the same time.  Greeted by numerous staff members throughout the evening that seemed truly proud to be representing this chef.  We ordered all kind of stuff throughout the night but a few things did stand out:  The salmon appetizer, JUST ORDER IT.  Salmon \"tartar\" which is actually just chunks of raw salmon and salmon roe atop avocado w/ furikake, served with nori chips. IT WAS SOOOOOOOO TASTY. My gma and I are fully prepared just to stop by for this and cocktail sometime in the future.  Uni w/ lemon foam was good if you like sea urchin, which I do. I enjoyed watching them prep it *You can walk to different kitchen areas and watch the chefs and talk with them  Crab something or other salad- good, flavors that I wasn't very familiar with but throughly enjoyed the little kick  My grandmother and husband were raving about the Wagyu tenderloin * I need to point out that THEY SERVED IT WITH A BONSAI TREE I think that was pretty special... you don't even get that in Japan But it was cooked table side just how they requested and my gma couldn't believe she can have this quality in Las Vegas. No more 12 hour flights for killer beef.  I ordered a 3 pound fish... it was good to ok... very fresh natural flavors which left me with a lot of fish and a lot of bland. I did get a few pieces of the skin and they were simply to die for but it left me wanting more. The amazing flavors that were seasoned on the skin, unfortunately did not permeate to the meat of the fish.  YOU MUST ORDER THE BUTTERY MASHED POTATOES. butter, with butter, with more butter .... or something like that was the description. THIS SIDE IS TO DIE FOR!!!!  We ordered some other things that weren't really worth mentioning.... but the salad dressing ( lemon flavored) def was worth a quick mention.  Dessert- Have them bring over the dessert cart so you can peruse over some of the tasty bon bons. We tried the staffs recommendations and I loved the yuzu based bon bon, as well as the poprock/hazelnut.",

    "text": "Daaaaamn homie. So legit. Rolled out with a crew and had an amazing time sampling everything. Stand outs:  - Foie Gras Cotton Candy; I always get it in LA and I wasn't about to drop my good habits. Can't believe I'm about to say it, but hell. Teeny tiny cube of foie gras for $8? Worth it!! - Robuchon Potatoes; Dear God, it was like whipped butter. Whipped. Wharm. Bhutter. I was stuffed after downing a huge chunk of Wagyu and I would've still been down to shovel more of this dish down my throat.  - Flat Iron Steak; What! How did this $50 steak end up being the stand out when we ordered like $200 worth of ribeye Wagyu?! It was so juicy and the bleu cheese kicked it up a hell of a notch. - Octopus; So tentacled. So tender.  Forgettables:  - Fresh Raw Uni; I've been spoiled by LA uni. The saddest five tiny slivers of sea urchin gonads came out, for $26! Sure, they threw in some lemon foam, but still not worth it. Although to their credit, it did make one gal who hated hated hated uni exclaim after trying it, \"Wow. That wasn't as horrible as I expected!\" - Skirt Steak; meh. Save your money for the better cuts.  Ordered a ton more food but those were the plates worth a mention. Also worth mentioning was our rockstar server Chris, aka Leo. Bore a striking resemblance to the actor (minus the scruff and dad bod) and graciously handled us calling him Leo all night. He expertly orchestrated our dinner so that we were stuffed and nothing was left on the table after.  Can't say anything about the drinks since I don't partake, but considering we racked up over $400 on just cocktails, I'd say they're pretty tasty. Can't comment on the dessert either, because we had to scramble to get to our reservations at Sapphire. Titties and dongs, man. Gotta keep our priorities straight!",

    "text": "Really 3.5 stars... not quite a Fan but better than 'ok'.  We did the 11-course tasting menu for $200 pp back in April. (I think they change it up every so often.)  While it was fun and eclectic, I wasn't bowled over by the dishes.  Nothing left me wanting more ...nor did I want to lick the plate on any of them. Maybe I went in with expectations that were just too high.  Maybe the tasting menu didn't give us a taste of what makes this a WOW kind of place. (That and the $600 bill - food, drinks, tax and tip - left me wanting more in terms of flavors and experience. Note, I don't mind expensive meals if the food and experience warrant it.)    Disclaimer: I'm super picky, and have had the luxury of eating at some really nice places that range from hole-in-wall to well-known establishments.  Food 3-stars 11-course menu - I'm not going to detail each course as that would take too long and be ridiculous. The oysters had too much smoke.  The cotton candy foie gras was fun with a sweet/savory type deal but I was comparing the foie gras to what I had in Paris a few months ago and I didn't think it was as good.  (They make the cotton candy fresh and it just melts in your mouth, not grainy or overly sweet, so that was pretty fantastic.) The Classic Tartare was lovely, but I would have preferred to just have that without the bun.  I feel like the bread deterred from the tartare.  The Beefsteak Tomato was surprisingly good. The octopus was prepared nicely but not memorable. The steak was prepared to the temperature we wanted but I was expecting it to be more tender.  The mashed potatoes were mostly butter... and while I LOVE BUTTER... this was over the top on the butter.  I think it was really Butter with a hint of potatoes.  Service 4-stars Fantastic!  The host was lovely and greeted us immediately as we walked up.  The bartender was quick with our drinks and made them with a fun flourish.  Our server was friendly and explained the menus to us, how they work and then gave us a bit of time to think before we placed our order. She checked on us throughout the meal at exactly the right times. Once we ordered, they brought the dishes as they were prepared... there wasn't a specific order that they came in with the exception of the steak and sides coming towards the end and the dessert being last.  They didn't seem to be timed ... in that .... at one time we had 3 different courses on the table.  I almost felt rushed even though I know we weren't since our meal was 2.5 hours.  That's definitely not rushing us.   Ambiance 4-stars Dark with alcoves for larger parties to have like a private-ish area.  The different animals on the wall were fun and definitely gave you a sense that this is a Meat place.  Note, not all the animals on the walls are represented on the menu.    I'm hoping they run a summer special menu like they've done in the past so that I can give this place another whirl.  I really really want to love it, but I just can't right at this moment.",

After spending way over $1600 dollars on steaks alone , not including the appetizers, libations etc  I would have expected a better tasting steak, No WOW factor at all might as well went to a below budget steakhouse This was certainly not how I wanted to spend my Las Vegas Celebration experience.. The appetizer s were also nothing to write home about. The Brussels sprouts were a let down, soggy with a weird acidic taste laced with grapes? The  Foie'Gras by way of  cotton candy was over before it started, lol.. No taste at all, more so a waste.. If it wasn't for the nice waiter and the tasty pot pies in the glass shoe, this meal/establishment wouldn't have even gotten the courtesy 2 stars given..  Bazaar Meats you have got to do better!!!",

The food and service are top notch, and I would compare it with anything that Vegas has to offer.  Cool atmosphere, world class food.  We ordered a tasting menu, so we got to try quite a few of Jose's best items.  My favorite items of the night were:  Wagyu carpaccio wrapped parmesan stick, with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm usually not a carpaccio fan, but this was fantastic.    Chateaubriand was served table side, medium rare.  It had an amazing light crust, just as it should.  When the mashed potatoes were delivered to the table, he announced to us that they were two parts butter and one part starch.  He described them as decadent.  He was right.  I'm a German from South Dakota, which pretty much makes me an expert on mashed potatoes; these are the best that I have ever had.  Items that I did not care for were:  The salmon roe and a cold tomato bisque.  We were served a selection of deserts, most of our group were very full but we tried most of the selection, and I did not hear any complaints.",

The sls in Vegas is a shell of the one in Beverly Hills but the restaurant is largely the same.  The fois gras cotton candy is always great and the rib eye was delicious.  However, the rest of the Jose's choice tasting menu was okay (in fact I think I did a better job picking my tapas when we were at the Beverly Hills location).  The service is was bit slow and after a long trip in, I was kind of spent by the time we were done.  Dinner started at 7p and ended pretty near midnight.  Perhaps my expectation was unreal as I recall the show saying that there was a meat tasting menu but I did not see one (plus this place is called bazaar meats).  Even the most expensive tasting menu $275 per person, had the same amount of meat so I'm must have been watching an older show.  Anyways, still a nice meal with a hefty price tag.  In the future I would probably choose my items instead of the tasting menu.",

But when the steaks and sides arrives; a) there wasn't enough food for two of us; and b) the steak was overcooked and bland.   I complained to the waiter. He comped us the value of our steak.

They never brought our soup.  We got our $$$pig 20 minutes after they showed it to us (I would prefer to get all our meet simultaneously otherwise one person gets stuck waiting... then we had to ask for our vegetables AGAIN!!!   The main thing is that we spent $1000+ for five people and NOTHING we had was event remotely remarkable.  Food: Cotton candy fois gras, interesting, but $8 each, no. Abalone- pretty good Shrimp and crab cocktail - Ridiculous! It was so small! Soup- never got it Wagyushi (sp?) beef- eat at Ruth Chris- so much better and you don't have to cut it yourself Wagyu beef on rocks- they cooked it for us, but it was cold by the time we got to 2nd piece Pig- chewy and with boney pieces inside. Cauliflower- yeah. It was cauliflower  Brussel sprouts- much better anywhere else  At the end they felt bad (maybe?) that they forgot everything so they brought us a \"Don't be a Lemon\" frozen cocktail made with liquid nitrogen- it BURNED the crap out of our mouths- BURNED!  Was it the liquid nitrogen? Wtf?  Do NOT WASTE YOU MONEY TO BE TRENDY and eat here!",

The mini-balloon popping olive in a spoon were not  - Beef Tartare:  Pretty damn good.  Nice spice.  Many flavors.  The beef was more steak-like, which enhanced the texture  - Veal Chop:  Solid.  Lots of fat, which I like.  It seemed more like a sous-vide prepared chop that was finished over the grill  - Sides: Buttery potato puree: One bite was enough.  Two bites and my mouth was coated in butter. Brussels sprouts: I didn't like the combo with the grapes.  I prefer my sprouts savory.  The garlic mushrooms were amazing.  - Service:  Solid, no complaints  - The menu:  It's a weapon!  - The space: Nicely spaced.  Not too loud.  I liked it",

Insanely great bite :-)  When we dined, we reserved the wine room--the fault I have was the table and chairs didn't fit quite well....  With the amount of people in our group, someone had the leg of the table between their own. Otherwise would've given 5 stars :-)",

Pan con tomate bread was a little soggy for my taste, too much tomato. Manager let us taste some of the jamon.  My friend raved about it, but I thought is was just OK.  Not sure if it would be worth  the $70 menu price.  Drinks at the bar were amazing, try the Scarlet Pimpernel, deceivingly strong :) Shout out to bartender Chelsea, she was awesome!  I would probably return and try the tasting menu.",

    "text": "It was a Monday night and apparently the restaurant was full, so we were able to snag two stools at the bar.  I'll start with the decor... and this applies to the SLS as a whole in addition to Bazaar.  It's just OK.  I can't say that it is by any means opulent or spectacular for the money.  There are these really weird and cheap looking clear plastic stags that where hung on the walls above the bar.  I remember seeing the wires and plugs for these weird lights and thought it looked cheap.  We were trying to put a finger on it and came up with this... It appears when they were renovating the old Sahara, they didn't have the budget to spend on a really professional decorator/designer, so they spruced up something worn and outdated half assed.  If you go to the Cosmopolitan, you will see the difference.  Thing is, the SLS is practically the same price and not half as nice.  I wasn't \"grossed out\" or anything, it's just not worth the money, restaurant included.   Service at the bar was not great but whatever, it's not like we were in a hurry.  Food... pretty good.  Not sure if the menu is the same or limited because it is the bar, but tasty none the less.  Really expensive drinks so be prepared.  All in all it wasn't bad, just not worth the money in my opinion.  I'd like to go back and try a table, perhapes I'll have a completely different experience.",

We ordered the Mishima Reserve at $65/lb, expecting that for 2 people, we would receive 1.5-2 lbs of meat.  The slab of meat provided was 2.75 lbs.  We obviously didn't know this when we placed our order.  I was a little stunned when we received our bill.  We had WAY too much meat, and couldn't believe they would give such a large portion of meat for just two people.  Needless to say, the food was delicious and everything else we ordered was fantastic, we were just not expecting to pay so much for the one particular item.  As good as the food was, I'm not sure we will go back, as I feel you can get just as good a meal for a much lower price.",

Clams with tigers milk were okay. Not great. The foie cotton candy is exceptional. One of the best bites I've had. The salmon cones are great and all of the sandwiches are creative modern takes on classics. This place is super pricey but worth it in many aspects.

(Cool air pumped out over our table all evening, so we were perfectly comfortable while enjoying the warm glow of the fires.) We started with the delicious salt air margaritas--8 thumbs up, the cotton candy foie gras (you have to, if you love foie gras!), and the smoke and ice oysters (the only dish we didn't love, just way too salty and smoky for our taste). Our fabulous server, Adrion, navigated the vast menu for us, helping us to decide first on the perfect cut of beef for our table, along with some amazing sides- the potato straws AND Robuchon because we couldn't all agree (and they were both delicious) and the Brussels sprouts petals--unique and sweet. We all shared two desserts, and left happily full without being overly stuffed. We loved the open kitchen atmosphere and the ability to taste a lot of dishes without feeling overwhelmed or rushed. Every dish is presented beautifully and served with great panache. Five stars for outstanding service, food, and atmostphere. We will most definitely be returning to Bazaar Meat!",

Although as the name implies, the menu is meat heavy, pescatarian and vegetarians need not fear. I ordered the smoky oysters and pulpo which were both fantastic. The octopus was so tender, and we also ordered several vegetable sides as well. The Robuchon potatoes were fantastic, I have never had mashed potatoes so creamy in my entire life. The brussel sprouts were actually my favorite of the night, usually I'm accustomed to roasted/charred brussel sprouts but this preparation was so light and refreshing. Lastly but not least, our server - Joe, was so great. He continually checked in with us to see how we were doing and was so friendly. At the end he brought out a complimentary chocolate dessert which was just the right size for us because we were so stuffed! Thank you Joe for making our anniversary dinner a lovely experience, we definitely had a memorable night.",

About 2-3 dishes were just okay, 10 dishes were excellent, and 5-6 dishes were amazing!

This is the guy who brought tapas to the US (?) for I was expecting tapas-sized portions. No, this was enough food to feed Franco's army. And that's not a good thing. The Frerran olives were sufficient in their singularity at Jose's tiny restaurant within Jaleo, \"e\" Five of them were like Nazi planes bombing Guernica. I had great expectations of the tomato tartare but they remain as elusive as an anarcho-syndicalist dream under Fascist shelling. The brussel sprouts were even worse. Like, why am I alive and eating this garbage? I should be as dead as Garcia Lorca, rather than attempting to discover flavour amid the cloud of tedious tastelessness. But finally, some beef arrives. Veer towers of breadsticks wrapped in in high quality beef, with a cheese dipping sauce. Very good. Worth the long bus ride from South Strip. Jose's gin and tonic would have been worth the price at $8.00. Not alas, the actual price, being twice that. I hope Jose is sending all this extra money to Haiti, where his world kitchen project is doing real good. Unfortunately, not real good food here.",

We did not order any of the big cuts (sacrilegious I know but we were still full from yesterdays Thanksgiving Turkey Feast) but we started with table-side prepped Liquid Nitro cocktail (best 7 bucks for the fun factor I ever spent) plus the foie cotton candy (wonderful) and Ferran Adrian Olives (real and liquid spheres (great for spanish olive lovers) followed by the caviar service with perfectly paired cava (yes we are at the home of a spanish chef so we stuck to spanish bubble for the very fun twist on classic caviar service), the perfect classic steak tartare (it was a HUGE mound of yumminess served on a marble pedestal), and the bocadillos (little sandwiches) of pulled pork (roast suckling pig type pork that takes a pork sandwich to a masterpiece type creation that was piled on the thinnest lightest crispest bite of bread that has ever melted in your mouth), and closed with the morcilla sausage and uni bites (the glass of Mancia wine was so perfect as chosen by the rockstar sommelier with the morcilla) and a few bites of 3 small desserts (loved everything passionfruit) and an earl grey bon bon.

The pig was chewy and salty! It wasn't necessarily bad but not as good as I expected having tried many styles of pig meat. I think the typical Chinese roasted pig is tastier than what we got at Jose Andres. The skin of the pig should've been lightly crisp. Instead it was very chewy. We also ordered the white fish. Again disappointed. Absolutely no real flavor accept for salt and pepper. Needed more spices or herbs to make it special. The only dish we all enjoyed was the steak tartare. Served with delicate dinner rolls was very tasty. The rib eye was good but not worth $200 for 3lbs?? I don't mind paying $$$$ for exquisite food but I didn't taste it at Bazaar Meats. Besides the steak tartare, I wasn't very impressed by our meal. The service was wonderful, however. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and pleasant. But we will probably not return for the food unfortunately. If you want a good suckling pig, head down to Chinatown!",

    "text": "The SLS is way far down the strip, and it was surprisingly quiet in here on a Saturday night during a fight weekend.  When you walk in, you see lots of large cuts of meat, open kitchens, and their open grill.    We were seated in the back in a larger booth, and large tables are necessary for all the dishes you get since most things are meant to be done family style.  Our server was Chris, who our friends had recommended from a great experience the week prior. He was energetic and knew the menu well and was able to guide us through ordering.  There are 5 different kitchens, so depending on what you're eating, different things come out at different times, but they paced and coursed our things out pretty well.   Drinks: 1. Cotton candy mojito: we had seen a commercial in the cab about a free cocktail for mentioning the commercial. The promotion had ended last month, but they were nice enough to bring each person a cocktail. I was skeptical since I don't love the cotton candy flavor (like with ice creams), but they poured the mojito over a bit of spun sugar so that it wilted down, and the drink was very well balanced and not overly sweet at all. I actually liked this a lot 2. Compadre: I love rye, apple, and lemon, so this was perfect 3. LN2 cocktail: this cocktail is made tableside and is pretty cool because the LN2 turns it into a lemon based sorbet with a shot of rum in it. It's a nice palate cleanser and is also a good way to start the meal   Food:  1. Cotton candy foie gras: a small cube of foie gras on a stick with cotton candy spun around it - not exactly what I  expected, but if you don't eat everything in one bite, then it's basically just cotton candy and a cube of foie 2. Chicharron: this is an impressive presentation with a huge stretched out piece, and it comes with a zataar spiced yogurt dipping sauce. It doesn't actually just melt in your mouth and has a good texture. The best part is breaking it apart with the mallet they bring you  3. Simple tomato salad: refreshing, light  4. Sloppy joe: on a brioche bun like the kind for a lobster roll. It was topped with fried shoestring potatoes, and the sloppy joe (beef bolognese) actually had really good flavor 5. Air bread: instead of the reuben, they were able to do the wagyu one with parmesan cream for us. I loved the philly cheese steak one in LA, and I don't love thousand island, so I liked this one a lot. The parmesan cream was a bit overwhelming, though 6. Beef consomme: disappointing. The presentation was nice with a quail egg and caviar at the bottom of a tea cup, then the consomme poured on top, but the consomme itself was not hot and was under salted 7. Tortilla sacromonte: barely cooked egg (wonderful texture) and offal; I'm not a huge fan of kidney, but the sweetbreads and crispy bone marrow were ok in small amounts 8. Classic tartare: sirloin, savora mustard, egg yolk, anchovy, and parker house rolls. I thought the two tartares were some of the best things we had. The flavor was wonderful, and it was a pretty big portion  9. Salmon tartare: salmon, ikura, yuzu, soy sauce, avocado, wasabi, and seaweed crackers. This wasn't too Asian in flavor, and it was a great combination of textures (with the roe) and flavors.  10. Setas: whole mushroom caps with good garlic flavor, but lots of oil 11. Robuchon potatoes: buttery, silky, smooth - pretty on point  12. Leeks: not too oily, good flavor with the balsamic reduction 13. Wagyu beef cheeks: tender, but not amazing in flavor 14. Suckling pig: we did a quarter ($140). It was actually really fatty, so the mixed salad to go with it was nice.  The flavor was good, but this was too heavy for me 15. Rosewood ribeye: they recommended a little under 3 lbs for 6 of us, and it was cooked well.  It was good in flavor but really rich, so I could only eat so much.  I actually thought the tartares were the highlights. We were way stuffed at the end, and though the dessert options looked appealing, only a few people got some small bites.   Overall, I would say it was one of the better Vegas food experiences, but don't come here if you're a vegetarian.  Our friends were also obsessed with the Jose Andres potato chips, abc the manager was nice enough to bring some by on the house for us to take back to them!",

Six of us started with fantastic cocktails at the bar and the General Manager, Roberto, gave us a tour of the kitchens before seating us. The incredibly knowledgeable sommelier, Chloe, navigates a wine list like nobody's business, and Elias and the wait staff treated us like royalty. We highly recommend all of the share plates. The charcuterie, steak tartare, heirloom tomato tartare and fois gras cotton candy are outstanding and unique. You simply have to experience them for yourself. (There's also a nice selection of seafood options to choose from) We ordered a skirt steak, chateaubriand and porterhouse, served family style for the table. The Joel Robuchon potatoes are lovingly called \"buttery sex\". A must try with the beef. The vegetable sides standout as incredible. We had cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leeks and mushrooms. I could be a vegetarian with vegetables like these! The pastry chef killed it with an assortment of sweet delights. My favorites were the chocolate and sea salt cookie and a chantilly with strawberries and  bacon. Everything was perfect and we highly recommend Bazaar Meat for an incredible gastronomic experience.  The prices of food and wine are very competitive, especially compared to some of the other steakhouses on the Strip. AND, they have a reasonable corkage fee if you're a wine collector that wants to bring that special bottle. Unlike most Strip hotels that make you walk to the casino area, they have their own private restrooms and are easily accessed from valet and public parking areas. Don't miss this dining experience.",

By comparison to local adventures, we have had steak at SW Steakhouse, The Country Club, Capital Grill and Hanks all in Vegas and over the past couple months and there is no comparison in quality although you can expect to pay more for dinner at Bazaar meats.  The menu is a little overwhelming so we asked our waiter Nick to make recommendations, which we inturn followed.  The suckling pig was amazing and that is coming off an authentic south east Asian pig roast just 2 weeks ago.  We much prefer ribeye and tenderloin over a strip steak (personally feel it lacks the flavor and tenderness) but Nick encouraged us to try it.  It was very tender and had incredible flavor.  We followed other recommendations suchs as the cotton candy foie gras and that too was special.  My wife and I will return here before any other steak house (and many other resturants).  If you are a carnivore or you just enjoy tender and perfectly flavored - woodfired meats - you will love this place.",

    "text": "Had high expectations given the hype. Restaurant was very cool but was surprisingly pretty empty on a Sunday at 930. I guess I just thought that supposedly great, cool, Vegas restaurants should always be packed.   I feel like we tried 100 things but only a few of them stood out.   - Croquetas de Pollo- I liked these, on the verge of being too salty which turned out to be the theme of the evening. Bechamel sauce made this a very rich bite.  - Air bread steak thing - Not bad - Beef with Oysters - Liekd this tartare. Heavy on the hoisin. Also probably the largest plate we had that wasn't steak.  - Foieffle - I was into this. A bit sweet, and very heavy on the foie. Liked the combo.  - Pig Ear app - this was a special that evening. Pig ears were treated like oysters and had some type of gelatin all around them. Wasn't a favorite.  - Grilled Pulpo with Potatoes - Incredibly salty. Inedible. Had to send back. Server said the potatoes were cooked in salt and acted like it was normal for this dish. I asked him to try it. There was no way. Kind of a bummer he defended it the way that he did.  - Robuchon potatoes - unreal how much butter goes into these. They were great.  - Grilled Baby Corn - ok I guess. Not into the mayo.  - Tomato Salad - Good.  - Mushrooms - Big mushrooms that came face up with what seemed like chimichurri inside each one. Very meaty.  - Rosewood Texas Wagyu/Black Angus - $145 for a pretty hefty portion. Steak was cooked perfectly and was very tender and fatty. A good rec by the server.   All of the above plus a $72 bottle of wine, and two cocktails came to $270 per couple. Pretty expensive especially given that this doesn't include the one dish that we had to send back. I left full but not completely stuffed. There wasn't any one dish that sticks out or that I'm craving. All in all I'm happy I got to try the restaurant, but won't be back to spend my own money.",

    "text": "To be honest the only reason we are giving this review the 2 stars was because our server was so great and understating. My GF and I are extremely well traveled and hail from NYC and Boston so we are no strangers to fine dining....I'll start by saying that we thought we where walking into a steakhouse but what you are really getting into is a tapas restaurant that serves steak. This place is also expensive even for a Vegas restaurant but hey it's vacation and the reviews where so good we decided what the heck.  Again if you are looking for a traditional steak, something from the likes of Burns, CUT, Flemmings, Smith and Wolensky, etc than this is NOT the place for you. If you are in the mood to sample a menu of mostly unusual cuts of meat that are sold by the ounce/lb then come here and go crazy. I'm by no means a foodie, just a guy looking for a great steak cooked the way I want, what I got was a very tough rib cut that was more sinew then anything. Our other steak was an extremely rare chateaubriand which was ordered medium by the servers recommendation as she stated all the steaks here are served on the rare side .... rare was an understatement as we couldn't even cut the meat (which could just be bad knives but who knows) The apps where good not OMG as where the drinks.  The saving grace of the night was our server who graciously took one of the apps and steak off the bill when she realized neither of us touched either one.  Again I can't beat this up enough ....big shame on me here : Should have set my expectations differently by realizing this wasn't a traditional steakhouse in fact it doesn't even come up when you search for steakhouses in LV.   Bottom line is after a meal like this I would tell anyone who asked to avoid this place but again, based on my comments above and kudos to our server, I will simply give honest feedback when people ask for recommendations.",

It's the kind of restaurant that someone takes you to any you return every time you're in Vegas.  We had 10 people last night and Stephanie upheld every moment of our experience to the standards that Bazar Meat creates.  We chose to let the kitchen choose our items with a bit of input from our table.  We had a perfectly paced meal.  Not too fast not to slow, perfect.  The mojito was not only delicious but fun to be served.  The cotton candy Fois gois is a favorite and worth the experience.  The apple wood smoked oysters are a show within a tasting. Our entree were perfect, Chateaubriand which couldn't be more tender, turbo fish that was flaky and perfect, chicken (don't laugh the chicken is incredible), a pork and apple dish, purred butter potatoes, roasted leeks, cauliflower and lamb were all perfectly prepared and served.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  I'd love to go again tonight!",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've had in a while. We've ate at other Jose Andres restaurants but this one from start to finish was the best and by a mile.   We ordered a few appetizers, a tasting of all the wagyu beef (three options), vaca veija steak, paella, and some greens and oh of course dessert.  Everything was delicious and it got better and better. I questioned the wagyu beef going before the vaca veija but you know what, it totally worked and I actually felt the vaca veija was a better steak than the wagyu. The foie gras s'mores...I love foie gras, and who doesn't like s'mores. It sounds weird but go for it. Now the dessert cart, O.M.G. So many different things to choose from including bon bons with pop rocks in them, an awesome eclair and eight other things that we ordered that I forgot already but we took it all down. Service could not have been better. All in all, make the trip to the SLS and eat here. You'll thank me later.",

Ok, so the food- we had the beef tartar-YUM. Carpaccio- YUM.   However, the to die for food was the chicharron and steak. I have never seen chicharron so big. It was fresh and the sauce was delicious, even though unnecessary.   For steak, we had chateaubriand and a marinated flank. The Chat was perfectly rare-medium rare. Butter tender. Expertly salted with finishing salt. And just unbelievably perfect flavor. The flank steak was also tender and excellent. Both came in shareable portions.  My SO is a steak snob and foodie and he loved the food and said it was once the best eating experiences he has had in a long time.   Service was expert too, helpful and attentive. Good wine and drinks. And, I had some oysters at the bar that rocked.   We will be back, whether in Vegas or Beverly Hills.",

    "text": "Undoubtedly one of the most unique places I've ever been.  If you're into the fun, adventurous, and quirky, Bazaar Meat is definitely a must-do on your food list.  There were three different tasting menus, but hubby and I couldn't agree which one to do, so we opted for a la carte instead.  Here is a list of the things we tried:  Foie Gras Cotton Candy - I don't eat foie gras, but this is my husband's favorite thing in the whole world. Chicken and Bechamel Croquettes - a taste of the familiar, rich and cheesy; served in a shoe.  Not a typo. Patatas Bravas - fried potatoes topped with tomato sauce/aioli and totally addicting. Grilled Oysters - hubby ate this one on his own, but he loved them so much.  I was too busy swimming in bechamel sauce to care. Chicharron - one giant piece hammered into smaller pieces right at your table and served with a delicious yogurt. Sloppy Joes - exactly like the sandwich of your childhood but a billion times better and with shoestring potatoes on top; so good! Gazpacho Shot - tastes exactly like the cucumber and vinegar salad my father made me as a kid; this was like heaven! Brussel Sprout Petals - fresh, clean and lemoney; be sure to get the petals at the bottom as they are sitting there marinating in the most delicious vinegairette! Jamon Iberico - thin slices of ham on a charcuterie board; pricey but worth it!  We had the best time sampling all these dishes.  Some were truly unique; others were a cool spin on something familiar.  But all were an experience all in it's own.  Definitely make your way to the quieter end of the strip for this - you won't regret it!",

It's location at SLS threw me off, but the positive reviews drew us in.  I'm so glad we went.  Most of the wait staff has been there since it opened a few years back and the are all consumed with fine dining and service.  Our waiter was named Chris.  He resembled Justin Timberlake and/or Leo.  His food and wine IQ was very high.  He had the history and a story for nearly everything we ordered, which made the meal memorable and special.  Everything from the table side bourbon presentation, to the wine, to the  table side Kobe beef, to the desert tarts was just amazing!!!  We had the house special \"pig\" and it was extremely unique.  The run out every night so be sure to ask about it early.",

I shared my experience and he said that is not their standard and invited me back. My original visit was on Fathers day and my return was on September 23rd.  Yes they knew I was coming but the service was off the chart GREAT and the food awesome. Temperature of the meat was spot on, sides were great and overall a wonderful experience.   Because we had such a nice second visit we decided to visit again the next night. Again a wonderful experience and the food was awesome. Service was off the hook great.

Somehow the flavors of the tomato was quite similar for all 3 dishes.   The main reason we came here was for the steak but I'm always critical of steak places if they can't make a strap exceptionally well then I may as well cook a good steak at home. The steak here was good but not something I would crave unlike the great steak you can get at Maestros in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "One of the top 25 steakhouse in the US, or so they say printed on the outside wall advertisement. As of this writing, Bazaar is also ranked #5 on Eater38 Las Vegas. We made a reservation for seven but it wasn't too crowded on a Sat night. Located inside the off strip SLS Las Vegas Hotel, you see the wood-fired oven as you walk through the restaurant.   The setting was dark and classy and our server was courteous and sincere. She recommended the tasting menu which starts at $125, $185, $270 per person and the rule was that everyone must order at the same price level. We decided to order al la cart and our final tab came out just under $1000 just to give you idea on the price.   Now if I was footing the bill, I probably give it 4 stars due to the fact the portion size is not too generous. If your hungry I recommend going to a $60 Caesars buffet instead. With price aside, the food quality is definitely there and is everything I expected coming from a $$$$ meat house.   Popular item Chicken Fritters came out in a glassware shoe which was cool but I thought the taste was just ok. The items that stood out to my palate was the Buttered Potato Puree, best potato I've EVER intaked on earth. The signature dish was Suckling Pig was $160/quarter was just enough for seven people to share and make sure you get a crispy piece.   This is the valley of steaks if your into that kind of thing. The variety of cuts can range anywhere from $40 American Wagyu to $400 Japanese Kobe Eye served on a hot stone. Try not to binge drink prior to this so you can actually taste the food. Also I recommend spending your money here early before donating it to casinos. Eat on carnivores!",

    "text": "Just thought I would go ahead and warn people before restaurant week, since I went here for the first time during restaurant week last year and it left such a such a bad taste in my mouth. A year later and I'm still pretty triggered.   Yes the food is great, it better be for the price, but if you are coming during restaurant week be prepared for terrible service. (As far as I know, everyone I know who comes here outside of restaurant week has never had any issues with their service. Unfortunately my experience was totally different.)  Dropped by with two girlfriends who wanted to try it for restaurant week. As soon as my friends and I arrived and said we were here for the restaurant week menu, you could practically see the distaste all over our servers face. I'm guessing he doesn't make as much in tips during these events because it was practically written all over his face.   Talk about being treated like peasants.  - First off, we did not get all the items that were part of the course. We thought the course was a bit sparse and had to add al la carte items to fill up. Only to find out later (when we double checked the menu) that we did not get all our items. To this day, I am still not sure if this was due to complete neglect on the server's part or a ploy to get us to add al la carte items to bump up the bill. Neither is a good look.   - Spotting the server was like trying to spot a white rhino in the wild. We were obviously not worth his time.   - The wait times between courses was ridiculous (5-10 minutes between the time we finished a course till the next course came. Keep in mind the courses are tiny and its a 10+ course meal) Then towards the end, he must of decided he was tired of playing his own game, because he just dropped everything off at once and fled the scene.   - The server initially spent plenty if time trying to convince us to order one of their regular courses, not the restaurant week/charity course. Which I found hilarious, because it was at this point we should have known everything was about to go downhill.   All in all, this place might be worth coming to on a normal day, but is only worth it if you don't care much for your dignity during restaurant week.   I cannot express how distasteful it is to do this during a charity event. It practically screams that the charity doesn't matter and that this is only done for the PR. Here's and idea. If your going to do a charity event to save face/look good and your servers are going to act like pretentious c*nts, make it a higher end charity event. Or better yet, make it a takeout food event. That way us plebeians can have the luxury of trying your food and you don't have to be soiled by our presence.  Luckily one of the girlfriends I was with has a boyfriend who is a manager at one of the Japanese restaurants on the strip. He was able to talk to someone from Bazaar and we were offered a redo. However, at that point the other girlfriend and I were so irritated, neither of us cared to go back. (That's right, even at the prospect at free food from a high end restaurant we could not be tempted to go back. That bad.) Had another close friend offer to take me back since he regularly comes for the suckling pig (and can't rave enough about it.) Nope. Nope nope nope.  So good luck trying this place out this week. May the odds be ever in you favor.   And to Bazaar, I hope you get your servers to hide their complete distain for this charity event a bit better this year.",

My wife and I shared the Smoke & Ice Fresh Oysters, The Classic Tartare, Vaca Vieja Beef Rib Steak and the Merino Lamb Rack. The food was decent but nothing to rave about. My biggest complaint was that the server didn't tell us how much food we were getting. I wasn't too sure about the size of the steak but it could definitely feed 2 people. The table of 2 next to us, who had the same server complained about the amount of food they ordered. They both ordered their own steaks and was pretty upset that the server didn't let them know one was enough to share.   Nothing special about this place besides how overpriced it is.",

For us, the winner of the menu was the actual steak itself - a chateaubriand, accompanied by the most buttery mashed potatoes ever. Other highlights of the menu include the foie gras cotton candy. I know that not everyone on Yelp liked this item, but it was the most different (and also enjoyable) single bite of food in terms of the starters. Our mouth is still watering thinking about the parker house rolls which accompanied the beef tartare.   The presentation of the items is whimsical, including the chicken croquettes being served in a shoe mold. The decor of the restaurant has hilarious dining chairs with comical portraits of animals, along with taxidermy animal heads on the walls - definitely not your stuffy steakhouse. Service is non-stuffy as well.  This place was not cheap, but we hope to come back again for their more affordable bar menu. Jose Andres is indeed a master.",

    "text": "Last Tuesday, I finally got the chance to eat dinner at Bazaar Meat in Las Vegas. I was in town for a business trip and was staying at the The W SLS, where I have stayed many times. Always, I've been curious about this restaurant but never had the opportunity to go. I booked a table for one for 7:45pm and as requested was seated off in a secluded area. All in all, my entire dining experience there was unreal. I wasn't planning on drinking and I look like a high schooler and I was eating alone so I was worried that the server would be dismissive - sometimes they are in situations like that at fancy restaurants and I had read recent reviews on Yelp about poor service here. However, my server was incredibly attentive and very sweet and friendly. I wasn't initially brought the summer tasting menu but saw online that it was available and requested it. The other tasting menus looked great as well but a lot more expensive and I was hoping to go for something more affordable for my first time dining there to see if I even liked the food. I ordered the foiffle in addition to the tasting menu because I was intrigued. Oh man. Everything about dining at Bazaar Meat is a absolute sensory experience - the food is a feast for your eyes and tastes even better. There's so much fun and creativity infused into the dishes here. With every plate that got brought out, I was totally immersed with simply enjoying the presentation, smelling the food, feeling the texture in my mouth, and of course tasting. I travel quite a bit for work and often eat alone so I usually bring my kindle to read while I eat. I had it set down on the chair next to me the entire time because I was so involved with this multi-course meal. Because it was my first time, the chef added a complimentary mushroom dish for me to try - incredible! Everything was so wonderful and delicious on every level. Also, all of the dishes seemed to be full side portions, which hasn't been my experience with most tasting menus. Needless to say, I was delivered more than plenty to eat with lots of leftovers to take home! My least favorite dish was probably the padron peppers, but I already knew going in that they likely wouldn't be the highlight of the evening. I simply cannot eat peppers like that. My favorite was surprisingly the Brussels sprouts petals, which was a light salad of the petals toasted with chopped dried apricots, grapes, and \"lemon air\" foam. Holy amazeballs. I could eat that every day. I also loved the foiffle which was a small light and crisp Belgian waffle stuffed with liver mouse and covered in a praline glaze, as well as the pa'amb tomaquet: Catalan style toasted cristal bread and fresh tomato and olive oil. The buttifara sausage was also amazing! Boy, now that I'm reliving this dinner in my head through this post, I just want to go back and repeat this all over again!!",

But it's not just meat, the ambience, service, side dishes, cocktails, and variety is what makes the place so unique. I've taken the family 2x and they've all enjoyed it. They even have a sloppy joe that's super kid friendly. In the 2 visits I've had, we've probably ordered about 70% of the menu, and it's a big menu. ALL of the \"small plates\" are amazing. There's an \"omelette\" type dish with bone marrow and sweetbreads that's unreal. The sausage dish is phenomenal. The suckling pig is GREAT. And of course, all of the steaks are delicious.

    "text": "We had a late reservation at Bazaar Meat for my birthday dinner. I love Bazaar in LA and I was very excited to try out another Jose Andres restaurant. I don't think the concept works as well in a steakhouse format, especially if you're hungry since the meats take up to an hour to cook their way. Also, the huge heavy menu was intimidating to navigate. After finding out the wait time for steak, I hurried to choose one. Since I wasn't paying, I chose the least expensive beef rib steak and the server came to explain that she recommended an \"upgrade\" that was the same price but slightly different. Honestly, I'm not sure what the difference was supposed to be but I went along with what she said. All I know is that both versions are from an older holstein.  With that out of the way, we started with the Foieffle, a soft airy waffle oozing with foie gras mousse. It was tasty and very messy to eat.  We had wanted to try the suckling pig but it's a pre-order only item. The server explained that there is a sandwich version of it available for us to try for $14. It was very good and I'm glad we only had a few pieces of the trimmings in the sandwich because the richness of suckling pig would've been too much for us if we had more.  At this point, the rib eye was brought out on a platter. It was beautiful. I took my photos and eagerly bit into it. It was so disappointing. I had underestimated how tough an older holstein would be. There were parts with sinew that I couldn't cut or chew and had to spit out. There was also a different flavor to it. It's my fault for not asking more questions up front or for trying to save my friend a few bucks but I really did not enjoy this steak at all.  It's a good thing the baby corn side that we ordered to accompany the steak was great.  When we finished the steak, it was really late and I didn't want to order dessert. It was really sweet of the server to bring out a mini white-chocolate raspberry cake with a single candle for my birthday. The experience was fun - don't order the tough meat though.",

    "text": "\"C'mon guys...this is why you're here\" - Jose Andres   So, 6 months have passed since we were last here to celebrate my and my good friend's (Jan K) birthdays and our experience was so memorable that we returned to belatedly celebrate my husband's birthday.  We remembered the succulent and crispy skinned suckling pig that we pre-ordered the last time and this time around, I made the same request.    This time around, there were only two of us so we decided to have a quarter portion of roasted suckling pig as our entree and supplement it with other items.  Our server, Bryan John, was vivacious, attentive and efficient.  His communication with his co-workers (bus staff and kitchen) was impeccable as we never felt rushed or waited too long before being served.   All of our beverages and food came out in a good pace during our 2 hour dining experience.  Bryan made wonderful recommendations as we mentioned we were on a \"pig-out mission\".  We started with adult beverages (Classic Old Fashioned and Sangria Roja).    -Our first appetizer was Bryan's recommendation which was Pigs' Ears served with Greek yogurt and za'atar spices.  We were expecting the pigs' ears to be thinly sliced and deep fried like the Okinawan \"mimigaa karaage\" () but instead came out whole, crispy yet chewy tender.  The yogurt and za'atar spices really worked with and enhanced the textures.    -Beefsteak Tomato Tartare:  tomato, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, cucumber, black olive served with baby romaine lettuce leaf cups.  Great tasting and fresh rich tasting ripe tomatoes were cut up like a tartare and we used the romaine lettuce as cups.    -Quarter of suckling pig served with mixed salad:  the fresh mixed salad of lettuce, tomatoes and onions was lightly dressed and made for a refreshing complement to the crispy roasted skin and tender pork leg.  The whole leg was brought out on a board then returned to the kitchen where it was de-boned and cut into serving pieces.    We ended our dinner with a post dinner drink called \"carajillo\" that we remembered from our last visit as suggested by Bazaar Meat's GM Eddie Famania and Bryan brought us a small \"sweet\" to pair with our carajillos.  Yup, we came to Bazaar Meat for that suckling pig and were again impressed by impeccable service and attentiveness through this fabulous dining experience.  We might just return within another 6 months for more of their Fire Pit items.",

    "text": "Need to catch up on some of my reviews from LV from last month...  The first time we ate here the Suckling Pig was one of the items that I really wanted to try but we had already ordered A LOT of food so we just couldn't expand the belly any more than we already had.  Returning here this last time the Suckling Pig was an absolute must have.  It did not disappoint at all, juicy meat glistening with fatty goodness, crispy skin of porky delight, and that feeling of caveman-like satisfaction to have a quarter of an animal laid out in front of you.   Some things to note: *You can order either a quarter or a whole pig and one thing to keep in mind is you do need to order this in advance. *It comes with a salad which if I remember right was dressed romaine and tomatoes.  We also wanted to try out a few other items we didn't have room for the last time which were the Brussel sprout petal salad, Beefsteak tomato tartare and a different steak from the ones we had prior.  The Brussel sprout salad was a refreshing side to go with the rich pork and beef.  It's the brussel sprout petals tossed in a citrusy lemon dressing with some lemon foam on top.  I think there were chunks of apple tossed in as well.  A very nice side dish.  The Tomato tartare was also fantastic.  Diced tomato mixed with black olives and olive oil and some reduced balsamic on the side.  Served wtih romaine leaves to spoon some of the tartare on and enjoy.  The steak we ordered this time was the Bone-in Washugyu strip loin.  It's a 20 oz. portion and was a nice balance of meatiness and fattiness, very tender as well.  We once again ordered the Salmon tartare, that one is just a standout and the next time we dine here, it'll probably be ordered again.  As the last time, we had an incredible meal.  Bazaar is definitely a five star experience.",

We've been here a good 6 times after our first visit and we've been coming by Eric. He is just simply amazing. His customer service was nothing short of amazing. His enthusiasm is amazing!

I believe the first  time ive spent was around $200 and the 2nd time was $150 by myself. Coming here will make your taste buds go WILD!  I always go to the bar to seem less lonely ahaha if youre here by yourself like myself. The bartender and server was OUTSTANDINGLY great with the whole recommendations and service. I come here pretty much every time im in the SLS or just wanting to eat in general. From my experience it really did blow me away. This is like my top 5 spots to hit in the USA.  I came here for a purpose. Which was the KOBE A5 wagyu beef from japan. That was my intentions. Came here and was not even judge by the employee since I  am a young,  out of place, and wearing normal clothing (nothing upscale like the place itself) The bartender helped me out with my indecisiveness self out. Got the candy Foie Gras to start, it was a really unique interesting taste. Its not a good palate for everyone. So some might be turned off by this flavor. It was rich and a hint of sweetness with the cotton candy wrapped around it.   Then the WAGYU came out. It was presented with a hot stone on the side with some veggies to be placed on it. Greeted by the server and the one who will sear it. Everyone is looking around at me like im some kinda  kid who ordered the most expensive meat on the menu by the OZ. well it is True but you never judge the book by its cover. The fat marbling on the meat was crazy. Already looking at it made my mouth water as they seared the meat on both side.  Then it was sprinkled with salt on top of it. More bigger chunks like rock salt or some sort. To top it off after it was \"cooked\" Rare  of course it was brushed with some kinda soy based sauce. Each  bite of each meat made me want to cry. Ive been wanting to try this cut of meat for the longest. Apparently there was only  9 restaurant in the USA that is cerified to serve it. It made me questions the other places i have trie but it isnt the same. To be able to try a legit cut of A5. Doesnt matter what kind of cut but  it will blow you away in tears. One of the gentleman brought out a certificate for me  since I ate a good amount of the A5 wagyu meat.  I knew it was legit. A lot of places i tried \"wagyu\" will denied my request to see their certification for the paper.  The wagyu Cappa was intense will flavors. Everything seems to be home made from scratch here. The airy bread kobe was also out of the world. Everything I  tried here was just blowing me away and made me cry tears of joy. The sucklin  pig sandwich from the bar menu was really flavorful and intense smell. if you can handle the smell wait till you taste it. Also got some dessert but it was alright. Everything else related to meat was just so CRAZYYYYY!",

We had a few small apps while waiting for our main meal. They cool the steaks over a wildfire grill to order so most the steak take 40-60 min to cook. The cotton Candy foie gras was the first small app these are tapas style it was excellent. Very different than anything you will try elsewhere. Sounds odd but the aftertaste reminded me of captain crunch. We then Had the Iberico ham which is very special ham from Spain. It was good it came with a bread that's had some sort of tomato puree on it and I wasn't a fan of that's probably wouldn't get this app again. Ox tail fritters we're awesome second best app we had. Soft shell crab app was awesome ! Would have ordered two of these. In fact we started eating it before I took picture then realized and took one but only one was left . Main meal we shared the 2lb grilled lobster ( one of best lobsters I have ever had) that grilled flavor just can't be beat. 20 oz bone in strip loin which was cooked to perfection. This is hands down one of best meals we have ate. We have made a tradition of coming to Vegas for our anniversary the last couple of years. This place has been our best meal both years we have came. Highly recommend this place if you love meat it can't be beat.",

(All Filipinos and Latinos will love this.) It was paired with Greek yogurt with some za'atar spices on top. I'd definitely get this again! Plus, it looks cool for the photo. :)  We tried two different types of steak, and both were really good... but I think my favorite was the VACA VIEJA... which (according to the Bazaar Meat menu) is made from cows raised in the European tradition, a more mature animal with more pronounced flavor, hand-selected eight-year-old working cows from Petaluma, CA.   I didn't realize there was a job force comprised of 8yr old cows working in Petaluma, and I also didn't realize that one should be on the lookout for mature cows. In the past, I thought that immature, fun loving cows would taste just as delicious...?  We also had the WASHUGYU ANGUS, which was also amazing. It was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. It also came with a ginormous bone, so it's kind of like getting a steak AND a beef rib all in one order.  The sides tasted AWESOME, but to be honest, we all thought the portions were pretty small for the price.  We had the grilled asparagus with romesco sauce, the ROASTED LEEKS with charred chipotle sauce (SOOOOOO GOOD), setas al ajillo (mushrooms with garlic sauce), and the buttered potato puree. The description for this one on the menu was funny - Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes. In retrospect, I wish we ordered the brussel sprouts too. Oh, well, next time!",

We stared with the potatoes bravas (good), moved onto some cured ham(really good)then on to the main course... the suckling pig was yummy and I really loved the peppers we had too, but the Waygu Angus steak was the best bite of food I've ever had EVER!!!! Desert was really yummy too! Honestly what made this whole experience even better was my server ANOUAR!!! He was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive, offered great suggestions, and was just overall probably the best service I've ever received at a restaurant! His accent doesn't hurt either!!! I'm not sure I'll have a meal this phenomenal in my life again, but a girl can dream! Thank you for making this Birthday Dinner one for the books!",

Service I must say was top notch, these guys are very good at what they do. Side note: SLS hotel was dead and seemed like it was on life support.  Snooze fest of a hotel for sure.  Viva Las Vegas!",

At the beginning, the menu might be a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, the waiters have great knowledge on it and will recommend how much and what is best to try depending on the amount of people. To start, we tried their pork rind which comes huge and they smash it table side and serve it with a side of greek yogurt. This was actually really good. We also ordered the ham croquettes as well as the chicken ones. The ham ones were a lot better than the chicken ones. The abalone was also ordered since had never seen it on the menu and it was really interesting. Interesting, but good. We also ordered the Beef & Parmesan Grissini which was basically beef carpaccio wrapped around a Parmesan breadstick which you dip into a warm cheese sauce. We enjoyed trying the carpaccio in a not so traditional way. When it came to the meat, we ordered the Washugyu/Angus (Lindsay Ranch, OR). We ordered 3 lbs to share which was enough since we had already tasted a couple of the appetizers. For the sides we did the piquillo peppers which were just to die for, the Delmonico potatoes, and an order of these little roasted corns they had. Everything was delicious and tasted amazing. There is not one side we preferred over the other because they were all that good. When it came to dessert, this is the reason for the 4/5. They weren't anything to rave about. The only thing we really enjoyed was the espresso ice cream. The little dessert they offer for tasting weren't very tasty. Also, almost forgot to mention that their drinks are really good. They have a good selection of things to try.",

Got a great seat right in front of of their \"fire stage\", where their team grills.  Inside, it's loud but not overly loud like STK. Pretty comprehensive menu; A5 wagyu, all sorts of seafood (caviar flights), suckling pig, and a bunch of \"fun dishes\"- foie smore's, iberico ham tacos, etc.   FOIE GRAS COTTON CANDY $8 - LEGIT! Sweet, fluffy, and light cotton candy juxtaposed with a caramel sized piece of slightly chilled foie gras. Worlds collide to make this sexy combo of sweet and savory. One of the best things I ever ate. (10/10).     RUEBEN $12 - Interesting take! Thin shavings of beef spiked with kraut on top a cream puff filled with sour cream that's been lightly spiked with horseradish. (6.5/10)  CHICHARRON $12 -  Outside of being ginormous, perfectly average. It needed something more acidic or vinegary as a dipping sauce than the zaatar spiked yogurt.  (5/10)  ALBONDIGAS MEATBALLS $16 - Juicy, great texture, it came with this saffron and almond sauce. (7/10)  SIERRA STEAK - $55 - Solid recommendation from our waiter. Good beefy flavor, nice sized portion, and the Oaxacan mole sauce was tasty. (8/10)",

We had reservations and still waited a few minutes though we overheard there was an hour wait for a table at 7:30.  The service was exactly what you would expect from a flagship Vegas restaurant with knowledgeable servers and timely service without being rushed.  Everything we selected was amazing.  We started with Vittore Carpaccio, foie gras cotton candy, patatas bravas and a cured meat that was recommended but I don't remember which one.  The carpaccio was great, potatoes and cured meat better than most and the cotton candy... WHAT??? I need five or six more to see if I really like it... ok I do!  The main courses were all stars every one.  We got their house ribeye, an organic ribeye, ibalota pork steak and a fish dish that didn't belong at the table just because everything else was so exceptional.  Get a ribeye here... you will not be sorry.  The buttered mashed potatoes as well as the leeks as sides were also worth a repeat.  All around awesome and I hope I get back again.",

    "text": "I confess I do not normally eat rare meat and my steak is usually well-done, but I am newly transformed after my visit to Bazaar Meat. I once scoffed at raw beef, but the preparation of the raw beef menu items here have me up late drafting this review and salivating as I think of the wonderful tartare and carpaccio at BM. But oh the COTTON CANDY FOIE GRAS is to die for!  The dining area is an upscale feel and if you're a little chilly, take a walk over to the blazing hot open coal fire grill in the middle of the room that miraculously doesn't invade the area with smoke or that commoner BBQ smell. This is a special place where aged meats are majestically displayed and the culinary vision of Jose Andres comes to life and appreciated. I must give special recognition to the fine dining staff for their attentive service and especially our server, Elias.  I pray that the struggling SLS will somehow find success and keep restaurants like Bazaar Meat around for a long time.  Classic Tartare - Prepared table side and served in a large marble bowl. This was a great way to begin our meat journey. Delicate minced beef bursting with flavor and served with warm, slightly sweet Parker rolls.  Croquetas de Pollo - Strangely served inside a plastic sneaker. Chicken Bechamel fritters were outstanding. The creamy burst with a crispy coating is something not to miss.  Oysters - Fresh, meaty and served with 3 different toppings. My favorite was the passion fruit something. Taste of the sea in an elegant dining booth.  Beef & Parmesan Grissini - I wish I had about a dozen of these to eat right now. The thinly sliced perfect washugyu beef wrapped around a seasoned breadstick and served with a Parmesan foam. Just get these!  Cotton Candy Foie Gras - What!? Truly an orgasm in your mouth. Just pop the whole thing in your mouth and close your eyes for the most luxurious experience. As the cotton candy melts and reveals the previous center of buttery foie gras that is also flecked with crunchy sweet bits, your mouth has only seconds to savor this fleeting delight. I would like another dozen of these.  Giant Pork Skin Chicharron - It starts with the largest piece of Chicharron that gets broken up at the table. Not as flavorful as the rest of the items, but nice for show.  Holstein Ribeye - Enough for 4 to share and takes about an hour to cook, which let us enjoy the little bites along the way. This meat was good and cooked medium rare. I like a little more flavor in my steaks but perhaps most carnivores prefer the bare taste of real grass fed meat.  Robuchon Potatoes - A must!! I like a little potato whipped into my rich and decadent butter and cream...at least that's what it tasted like. So airy and light, you won't feel your cholesterol levels hitting the ceiling.  Piquillo Peppers confit - A wonderful accompaniment to the meat.  Grilled Asparagus in Romesco sauce - Lightly grilled asparagus on top of the nut and red pepper sauce. Another nice accompaniment.  Dessert - a box of assorted chocolates and treats to enjoy and later take home.  A primal yet sophisticated journey into the world of meats that satiates both your visual and gastric faculties. Thank you Jose Andres.",

    "text": "So I came to this restaurant with high expectations because of chef Jose Andres reputation. The first time I came here the restaurant was just a month old and among the three of us we ordered quite a bit of food to try:  From a selection of appetizers including carpaccio to tartare, cured meats and more plus the entrees of suckling pig, ribeyes and blue fin tuna steaks, califlower steak and more veggies. I think the restaurant is still working out kinks with consistency. For instance in my first visit the classic tartare was good, but on my return visit there was way too much mustard which overpowered the entire dish.   All of these were underwhelming with the exception of the suckling pig. The steaks were just okay and I would in fact visit many other steakhouses here in Vegas before choosing bazaar for a steak, even if the prices were comparable but bazaar is pretty pricey.  The bluefin tuna steak was a disaster. Quite expensive and literally we spat it out and returned it, it was so bad because it was extremely fishy, and they didn't bother trimming the fat appropriately. It literally ruined our meal because you couldn't get the taste of what seemed to be a rotten, decomposing piece of tuna out of your mouth. I've had lots of great blue fin tuna at many other restaurants , cooked and raw but I would never again order it here.  So after that fiasco I had resigned never to return, but a friend told me that it was worth giving another shot for the pig, thus...  So to the main event: the suckling pig, which is over 100 for just a quarter portion which I think feeds two people, or 500+ for the whole suckling pig. Expensive if you consider Asian roast pig prices.... But.... It was delicious. Deliciously thin and crispy skin with an extremely moist meat. dripping with juices it was the best roasted pork I've ever had. Unfortunately on my recent visits they were simply out. For an item that the menu claims to be the quintessential \"heart and soul\" of bazaar meat, you think they would be adequately prepared at 8pm on a Saturday night.  Come here for the pig and nothing else... If they have it... and you're willing to drop a good chunk of change on said pig.",

I think it's called croquetta de pollo & it came it this cool glass shoe! Props for presentation.   We also ordered the sloppy joe's or something like that and that was DELICIOUS. The bread was so soft.. The appetizer melted in your mouth. Although it was a little to salty and that's saying a lot coz I LOVE SALT.

We had the Lucia's salad, Cotton candy foie gras, Pulpo Octopus -Glacien style, Ribeye, Croquettes de Jamon, Grilled baby corn, and skirt steak... Everything was great but we felt very rushed to get in and out and for 4 of us, the bill was over $400 with a glass of wine each - and we didn't leave super full.

    "text": "Theme of the restaurant - Bazaar! Nice vibe to the place, strange, modern style, semi-loud and not so much intimate.  The beau and I have been dying to try it since hearing about their Vegas appearance! Expectations were just a little TOO high after this first visit.  Overall, staff were friendly .. but the VERY, VERY casual attitude of our server was bit of a turn off. We are still at a high-end restaurant, I expected class and professionalism from everyone in the restaurant.   Drinks we had : - Truffles N Bees : I LOVE truffle anything! This was the perfect combination of citrus, honey, truffly, bubbly goodness! - Magic Mojito : Magic, because the cotton candy dissolves when the drink is poured on top - other than that it's too sweet. - Don't Be A Lemon : too lemony for me, but a pretty good palette cleanser.  Food we had : - Cotton Candy Foie Gras : 98% cotton candy, 2% foie - playful but would like more of the foie - THE Foieffle : air waffles, foie, peanut butter, honey - I really liked the texture but could use a little less peanut butter - Croquetas de Pollo : REALLY GOOD, must try! Salty, cheesy, fried chickeny little bites! - The Classic Tartare : presented and done table side, very entertaining. Beef, eggyolk, mustard comes with rolls ; would've preferred it on crispier bread for texture purposes. - Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron : they don't kid around with \"super-giant\", definitely enough to share. Who woulda knew chicharron tasted SOO good with Greek yogurt!? - Morcilla with Uni : Spanish blood sausage, fresh sea urchin (DID NOT WANT TO EAT, not my cup of tea) -Wagyu Beef Cheeks : SUPER tender, SUPER juicy and tasty, melt in your mouth - MUST TRY! - 8yr Old Holstein Bone-In Ribeye : DISAPPOINTED! I love my red meat and have had my share of different taste, quality and expectations from a good ribeye to a bad ribeye. Our steak was very bland, dry, very chewy .. Weird because it look medium rare but had the texture of well-done. - Delmonico Potatoes : creamy but nothing special. - Cauliflower Steak : loved the pine nuts and lemon with it but could've been executed better.  Desserts included Passion Fruit / Green Tea Cake & Salted Caramel Ice Cream, simple but rich in taste and texture, quality is there.  I really did enjoy the chicken croquettes, chicarron, and wagyu beef cheeks, wouldn't mind indulging in those again. But I can't get over the disappointment of the main dish, our steak. Our server's was pretty bitter when we had brought up our complaint, instead he brought us out a little bowl of salt, which did nothing to the steak.  The issue could've been handled better and we're not ones to ask for accommodations, but the bowl of salt might as well have been a slap in the face.  Suggestion, may be just sticking with the smaller plates instead of the not-so-big entree meats.",

    "text": "I picked this place for my birthday dinner and overall it was a solid pick.   We were given a standard menu, a beverage menu to peruse. There are tasting menus so ask for them as we werent presented with them at first. We remember there was a summer menu and we asked about it, and then they produced this menu for $85 ($65 promo price is no longer). This made me a little apprehensive about picking this place as I don't like when it feels like they are almost hiding options because they want you only to do the spendy menus only. It was described as very small 2 bite, but now that I see some friends reviews, I should have gone with a tasting but I was afraid of the whole having a cheap second dinner because it wasn't substantial.   The hubby and I over ordered a la carte.   I got a cocktail that was really well made. Forgot the menu name, but it had meszcal in it and some nice herbaceous companions which was perfect together.   We started with the foie gras cotton candy. Fun food, but not something I feel is a must like others. I prefer the foie in a different manner, but glad I tried it as it does oddly pair well together. It's just the cold little cube of foie was not doing anything, it was just there.  Then the  classic beef tartare. It's not normally a dish we order, but heard great things. The portion was made tableside so you can get it seasoned just to your liking. I like that it came with warm rolls and there was way more tartare than you can fit into them so it's very generously portioned. Very good tartare, probably one of the better ones I've had.   Grilled  pulpo (octopus) had a bit of a aggressive seasoning to it (in salt and seasonings), but has a nice char and still pretty good.  Butifara Sausage is made in house. It was solid as far as sausages go, but I feel that this could have been skipped for something a bit more \"special\", if you will. Huge portion, so get maybe only if you have a large dining party.   Waygu beef cheeks was buttery delightful. It's very rich in flavor as theres nice fatty bits woven in there and the red sauce with it was sop up with some bread good.   We got the Robuchon potatoes and it was indeed butter on butter. It was heavy, really too heavy as a main side as I wanted just 3 bites as the meat selections were already rich.   Brussel sprouts roasted with a lemon dressing sounded like something that will lighten up the meal, but it was seriously a WTF dish. Soft veggies, sitting in a bowl with lemon water on the bottom, grapes and apricots that felt like a fruit salad spilled in it from another dish.   Dessert we picked a few mini bites, a little tart, a few cream puffs. Nothing as bad, but nothing stood out as more than okay either.   Service was friendly enough, but fine dining professional and unobtrusive. The pace of the kitchen was steady to where we were getting food in a good succession aside from the sides coming dead last after eating a lot of mains without anything.   I feel like partially that we order differently we might've had a better time with the meal, but another part of me thinks perhaps the style of how food is seasoned is not particularly in my wheelhouse either. Glad I tried it, but not rushing to be back. If I do, I would scale down a lot and cautiously choose mains and sides while I scarf down more of that tartare.",

I went back again this past weekend and after conversing with the manager, I figured a review was overdue.    Forgetting about the food (for a sec), the atmosphere is certainly unique: custom knives in a display case, dry aged meat locker, giant wood-burning fire filling the room with all types of sounds and smells.  Walking further into the restaurant reveals a charcuterie counter, dessert carts, a raw bar, various wine displays, and a host of unique tables and chandeliers.  I say this because there are many places to get good food, but this is a unique experience that really makes the night feel like an event.    When something as simple as a gin & tonic is prepared with several different fresh ingredients at your table, you know you're in a for a treat.  Fun fact: we ordered many cocktails, yet each had its own distinct shape of ice.  In the grand scheme of things, does this really matter?  Not at all, but that's exactly why it does.  The details.  What madman decides to put foie gras and cotton candy together?  So tasty I almost ordered a 2nd round as dessert.  From dry aged Wagyu to our veal chop with the delicious Mojo verde, everything delivered.  The icing on the cake is the staff.  Our server was attentive and made good suggestions to complement our dishes.  We arrived early for our reservation and the manager came up to us a few times to let us know our table status.  We were thanked for our repeat business with a few items to try, but it did not feel rehearsed - there was True sincerity in their words and it was felt.    I can't wait to come back again with a larger group...that suckling pig is going down!",

The carpaccio on crostini was so good I thought about a retake instead of dessert. The chateaubriand is top notch and the Pernod sauce nicely accentuates it. The rubichon potatoes are to die for. The only mediocre dish was the Brussel sprout petals. While they were cooked and cooled perfectly, there were too many distractions.

    "text": "Second time at Bazaar Meats yesterday and lived up to my memory of it from six months ago! Everything was the same if not better than my last visit. They added a couple new items on the menu and we ordered waaaay more than our stomaches could hold. Started off with the half dozen Smoked and Ice Fresh Oysters. The extra touch of mini diced apples was interesting but didn't care too much for it. From there we moved into our second dish, The Classic Tartar. This is definitely a must have here! There was only two of us so after chowing down half of the dish we had to stop ourselves from eating to leave room for the main entrees. We opted in for the Grilled Maine Lobster, this is a new dish on the menu since my last visit so we had to give it a try! Lobster was outstandingly delicious! They served it whole in shell but made it easy to eat as well. Followed by the New Zealand Lamb Rack. I could not forget how amazing this dish was from my last visit and had been raving about for quite some time. Turned out to be just as amazing as I had remember it to be! YUMM! Since we didn't get the signature steak last time, we had to try it out this time! Opted in for the Rosewood, TX Wagyu/Black Angus. Turned out to be a whomping 2.5lb of yummy yummy goodness. The beef literally melts in your mouth! MUST HAVE! We obviously ended up with a ton of leftovers as our eyes were way hungrier than our stomaches! So definitely recommend trying this place out with 4-6 people in order to try a little of everything.",

    "text": "Staying at the SLS Las Vegas was a first for me.  However, working down the street from the SLS in Los Angeles, I was familiar with the hotel and with Bazaar.  I made an appointment via OpenTable and originally planned on having about a dozen people.  Well, that number grew to 15, then 18 and then back to 16.  Everyone at Bazaar Meats was terrific, starting with Hayley and the manager who was there the evening of our meal.  They moved around tables, gave us a private area for our large party, and assigned a gentleman named Nick to be our server.  I am not sure what happened to some of the others who offered their reviews, but I have to strongly disagree.  We did agree to a set menu, but from a host's point of view, I thought it was a wise decision (and recommendation).  The restaurant was very, very busy and the food tended to come out slowly; yet the presentation and taste of all of the dishes were worth the wait.  I had some very, very high profile guests.  Everyone enjoyed the experience, the private area, the great service offered by the manager and Nick, the unusual but interesting presentation of food, and the great wine suggestions offered by Chloe, the sommelier.  Nick and team made some great suggestions on food options and everyone enjoyed their experience at Bazaar Meats.  I would definitely return.",

I also had the bisson buffalo carpaccio which was truly amazing and a treat for the mouth. The six small strips in the serving were just not enough, but oh so good.  I had to try the Reuben on air bread, and it did not disappoint, the meat and condiments were heavenly, and air bread means just the crust, which was delicious, the whole thing was only the size of your middle finger, and again, I could have had 3 or 4.  I love pork rind, so decided to try what was described as a 'giant' one and came with yoghurt. It truly was giant and night and day from what you buy in the grocery store. This was just delicious, with just the right amount of spices sprinkled on the top. The yoghurt was good, but a little ordinary compared to everything else. I am already wanting to go back for more.  I thought i was done, but I was spoiled with an off menu treat. I was talking to one of the managers about my love of bone marrow and sweetbreads, and he brought me this delicious new leek dish, with morel mushrooms, a sauce I cannot begin to describe, and crickets filled with liquid bone marrow ! Talk about YUM ! All these wonderful textures and flavors and then you pop one of these croquets into your mouth, and it is filled with this amazing, warm, liquid bone marrow - out of this world superb.   I cannot rave about this place enough and would have gone back again tonight, but ran out of time and they close at 10 p.m. Definitely coming back and checking out the L.A. venue.",

    "text": "Overall, Chef David Thomas and his staff do a great job of serving a (primarily) meat menu with a unique twist.  I have visited twice when I was in LV on business and I've not yet been disappointed.  The meat is all very good, from the Spanish charcuterie to Rib Eye and the fabulous but oh so rich Kobe.  Expensive, but great.  The other dishes are more hits than misses, but a few things like the cold foie gras wrapped in cotton candy puzzled my palate and was less than stellar.  The vegetable dishes were all very good and the seafood raw bar is about the best I have ever experienced.  The sommalier is wonderful and really knows his food and wine pairings.  I ask the wait staff to allow the sommalier to make recommendations and custom wine flights based on what I have ordered and it's been perfect.  The negatives are relatively minor - the dessert menu is rather limited and there is too much reliance on chocolate, IMO.  The stone serving plates were beautiful, but some of them were chipped and cracked on my last visit.  As mentioned, the prices are a little on the high side but that's the new normal for high-end restaurants in LV.  And finally, this restaurant deserves to be in a better location than the SLS, which lately seems to be devoted to attracting the low-rent party crowd.  Other than the location, this restaurant is highly recommended.",

I especially loved the little \"extras\" like those chicken fried thingies (not sure of the name) and the cool liquid nitrogen cocktail cart. Just things like that which you don't see every day. The food was amazing, particularly the steak (of course) and the cauliflower. Just a lot of things that are hard to forget. I am rarely impressed anymore, even in very expensive restaurants. It's so refreshing to go some place that puts effort in being creative. Anyone can serve a good steak and provide good service. Bazaar Meat meets that bar and well surpasses. Highly recommend.",

For the astronomical price we paid to dine here, the featured suckling pig was very mediocre.  In addition the ribeye steak was flavorful but lacked tenderness.  The appetizers and side dishes were very well crafted. The drinks were also excellent and hats off to the pastry chef for creating some very delicious desserts.  If we were to return, we would avoid paying $300 for a piece of pork and a ribeye steak to be shared and instead just stick with appetizers drinks and dessert.",

    "text": "One of the best steaks I've had. We ordered the middle grade ribeye for three (2 1/2 pounds). Along with the Roubuchon potatoes and two appetizers (cotton candy foie gras and one of the carpaccios), this was the perfect amount of food. The steak is better than other high end steakhouse steaks because it has a *slight* dry aged flavor that is almost an aftertaste, followed by the fatty juicy meat flavor. I find most dry aged steaks too dry and gamey- this was the perfect flavor. The fat content, unlike most ribeyes, was also just right. You didn't struggle to cut through any gristle, and 100 percent of the meat was edible and delicious, not too fatty. The steak is also presliced, which is great. It's a level of meat where you stop talking and savor the flavor, focusing on the taste. Almost melt in your mouth, but not in a Kobe beef way- just authentic prime ribeye that's at the very top level. Significantly better  even than the Capital Grille in Chicago, and that's a tough standard. The Roubuchon potatoes were astounding. Best I've ever had and a perfect compliment to the steak, they are a must. The carpaccio was just average, and the cotton candy foie gras was interesting but tiny. There are lots of things on the menu here but I would recommend just ordering more steak for your money. Don't miss this one.",

There were only a couple things that I didn't like: there were piglets hanging in the meat section which really grossed me out because they're PIGLETS :( and the other is that there is Kobe wagyu and however you want to slide and dice it, the cows never get to walk- ever. They are suspended in the air their whole life and they get \"massaged\". Sounds like a horrible life for a cow since they like to gaze and roam. I'm no PETA contributor but I just didn't like those things. Our server Tony Ortega-Perez was very good. Extremely professional and efficient.",

    "text": "I really enjoy most SBE restaurants. I heart heart all Jose Andres restaurants, heart it so much that I take most of my friends visiting to Bazaar @ SLS or suggest for them to go to one of his many restaurants around the world.  I'm such a fan that my fiance actually proposed to me at a Jose Andres restaurant, the wonderful e by Jose Andres!  Ok, now that I've prefaced how much I enjoy Jose Andres restaurants, I need to say how royally disappointing my experience at Bazaar Meats was this past weekend.  My friends and I were in Vegas to celebrate my fiance's birthday and naturally, the consensus was to go to Bazaar meats for its great group dining experience, the fun decor, the delicious cocktails, and the usual of what we know Jose Andres for.   Upon checking in, we were seated at a table that was not for the right number of guests that we had. I had requested a booth but it was not noted.  I let it slide because it was getting late and we were hungry. After being seated, our waitress greeted us, handed us a lot of menus and shortly left and never returned...for a while - a long enough while for my fiance to be able to go wait in a long line for his '$30 dollar birthday credit' at the other end of the casino and come back and we're still waiting.  Naturally, a different server came and apologized for the wait and explained the menus to us while 'we wait for our waitress to return'.    My fiance and I are huge winos.  For a meat restaurant, the list of by the glass cabernets is very limited, if I remember correctly, there was 1 amidst a huge wine booklet.  He finally had to opt for the one cabernet offered at $30 a glass.  The food - such a let down for what we were expecting.  Although the night started with gazpacho shots which were delicious, all the dishes that followed came out cold and/or overly salty. One of the first dishes we had was the Salmon Tartar.  Our first bites into it was met with silence - not the oh-that-was-so-good-I'm-speechless silence, more the is-it-just-our-own-particular-taste-buds-feeling-saltiness or I-don't-see-why-this-dish-is-so-great-even-though-my-friend-adamantly-recommended-it. We mentioned to our waitress the issue we had and she told us that maybe it was the nori crackers that came with the dish.  We were fine with the nori crackers' saltiness as those are chips and expected to be on the saltier side.  She let us know that nothing could be done with our tartar dish so the only thing she could do is offer us some bread in hopes that it would dilute the saltiness - ok thank you for that, moving on.  All dishes that followed were just as overly salty and the cocktails were not helping.  One of our main dishes was the Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus Rib eye.  For the price we paid at $95/lb, it was underwhelming - it came out like it had been sitting on some other table for a while and the taste was quite bland.  At this point, we did not bother to mention to our waitress any of our concerns about the dishes anymore.  We just wanted to get our desserts, sing happy birthday and call it a night.   Dessert came with a candle that kept blowing out before it reached the table so it was a bit of an awkward scene for my fiance. We ate it and asked for the bill.   The bill came and we noticed the bread was charged.  We all raised our eyebrows and decided not to make a scene.  If anything, we enjoyed the bread the most out of that evening! In our attempt to leave as soon as possible, we forgot to use the $30 credit.  We mentioned it to our waitress who then did not know how to reprocess everything, so we just waited again.  Our waitress ended up not coming back with the bill but a different gentleman did.  He seemed to know what he was doing more and offered us something to drink while we waited for the bill to be processed but we just wanted to leave so we said no thank you.   I don't think my palette was off that night because the friends we went with had been to Bazaar Meats before and had ordered some of the same items we ordered because it was so good the last time they went.  They noticed the significant difference in taste and service and were apologetic in recommending this place for the weekend.   I also don't know if it was an off night for Bazaar Meats though or a 'waiter in training' night but it was a very disappointing experience and it's sad to say that at this moment, I would not recommend this place to anyone wanting some meats in Las Vegas.",

I pride myself on BBQ and smoked meat and choose to not eat out in many steakhouses but this place rocks.  We had a small appetizer made with clams, served in the shell that was a special and not on the menu.  In addition we went for the Secreto Iberico de Bellotta and the bone in strip loin.  Both very tender and prepared to perfection.  We will definitely be back!",

Then we talked about oysters and she sold us on three different West Coast. Only two types of West Coast showed up. They do not offer horseradish by the way. Oysters were not fresh as i spat the first one out and sent the whole thing back. During the whole process we told her quite a few times how hungry we are. After about 45 minutes of drinks and ousters, we get to the part of ordering meat. She at that point decided to tell us that the ribeye that she sold me about  from the beginning would take 50 minutes to cook. At that point i asked her kindly why she didn't tell us that from the beginning, at the same time when she asked us if we had ever dined with him before. So we left to get dinner somewhere else.",

We did not clearly understand the concept of the \"family style\" entree service, probably because it was poorly explained by waiter #2 who promptly disappeared after promising he would \"totally help walk us through it all.\"  Waiter #3 helped clear it up after we started ordering steaks separately like a group of professional meat eaters.  They were out of the ribeye we ordered so the waiter made a smart substitution.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of gristle and sinew in a good portion of the steak.  The flavor was fine, just not that much fun to eat.  We ordered several vegetables and a salad to compliment the meal, all of which were REALLY petite.  We were starving so ate every morsel.  The atmosphere is really chic.  Highly recommend the boozy slush on the drink menu which is dramatically prepared at your table.  Potent and yummy.  We were expecting to be wowed.  We were not.",

    "text": "I have been to a lot of Jose Andres' restaurants - Jaleo, The Bazaar (Beverly Hills and Miami), and China Poblano. When I heard Jose Andres opened a steakhouse, I had to try it out.  Be forewarned, this place is pricey, even as high end Las Vegas steakhouses go. But the food is tremendous.   After some collective sticker shock, our table decided to get the $200 tasting menu. Other reviews have probably given you the entire list of what they ate. To be honest, there were so many courses, I lost track. Here are my highlights:  Caviar flight: Word of advice - go for the sturgeon-based caviar. You will not be disappointed. Tartare: The tartare is prepared table side and served along with slider buns. Delicious. Steak: We had the Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus rib eye. The perfectly carmelized steak was super good  (served sliced, and presented with the bone). The waiter told us we got 2 1/2 pounds of meat (for 4 of us); we were not wanting after this course. Mashed potatoes: The description says \"butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes\". They weren't kidding. This was mashed potato goodness. Dessert: We had a selection of tarts and what looked like petit fours. Excellent.  All in all, an awesome meal. Put this on your list the next time you're in Vegas and are looking for something different than the usual steakhouse.",

    "text": "My husband has a thing for eating at a Jose Andres restaurant whenever we go to Las Vegas. We don't do shows and I don't gamble that much. However I will gladly blow my work bonus on a good meal.   The main courses are family sized portions, or at least enough for 3 people. The appetizers and desserts are individual portions. I would still share the spoon or something. It is worth it.   I love the space of this place. A play on traditional and modern decor. The mismatched chairs sometimes have animals wearing sunglasses or hats. There is plenty of seating for large parties. I would recommend getting a reservation, even if it's for two.  If you're overwhelmed by the selection, here's what blew my mind: Foie Gras cotton candy - with foie gras in the middle. Sweet and savory and amazing. This was the amuse bouche. Damn it. I would gladly pay for a proper carnival sized portion of this. Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron - Title is completely accurate. A gigantic slab of fresh chicharron is served at your table, then smashed to bits by the server. Never had chicharron with so much good texture and good salty flavor going on. So much for eating the regular bagged stuff for the rest of the year. Foie Gras s'mores - Never look at s'mores the same way ever again. I thought the foie gras would be overwhelming. No. It somehow made the chocolate taste better and counter the almost too sweet marshmallow. Again would pay for another plate, for myself. Gazpacho shots - I would recommend getting this before the main course. It made a tasty palette cleanser. Robuchon - here's the menu description: \"Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes.\" Yes it tasted like really good butter that's barely held together with finely mashed potatoes. When it got cold towards the bottom of the bowl, the whole thing solidified like butter. It could also show what this entire meal was doing to my arteries.  Yes fine but WHAT MEAT DO I CHOOSE? We ordered aged beef (Mindful Meats, CA, 8-10 yr. old Holstein). The cooks actually know what medium rare looks/feels/tastes like. Our server was right in that it was so beef flavored it was almost game-y tasting. Not a bad thing. To be honest every meat option looked and smelled amazing whenever someone else's order passed by.  Finally, save room for dessert! The portions aren't big so you can literally pick a little bit of everything to go with your coffee, tea, or dessert wine.  Didn't get into e (@ The Cosmopolitan)? Don't be sad, my friend. Bazaar Meat is a strong alternative and much easier to get a table at.",

It was a little too spicy but our back server was able to tone it down a little. The wine list is extensive and very overpriced, but thats what you have to expect in vegas at a steakhouse. We shared the 2 lb t-bone, which takes about an hour to cook. While we waited, Cam brought us some delicious chicken croquettes in a glass sneaker. Very nice of him. In addition to this amuse, cam brought us some mash potatoes that were to die for and some smoked octopus! Everything was amazing. To end the night, we were surprised with a dessert platter with 5 small little treats and a frozen st. germain sorbet made table side as well. Everything was spectacular. we will definitely return and hope to get cam again. He truly made this dinner one to remember. Thank you!",

    "text": "Jose Andre is my favorite chef. I have been to several of his restaurants. So needless to say, I was VERY excited to go to Bazaar Meat.  Bazaar Meat is Chef Andres' take on a steakhouse. The menu is partly filled with his unique version of tapas. Then also filled with steak, steak and more steak. Everything is designed to be sharable. And it is all delicious.  We started off with one of the finest charcuteries ive ever seen. One mouth watering taste of meat after another. Of course topped off with some mind blowing Jamon iberico.  As featured in the LA Bazaar, I had to have the foie gras cotton candy. It's seriously the best thing ever. So good, I ordered one for desert as well.  Also tried the Jose's take on a ruben sandwich. And it was magic in my mouth. Soooo good.  Now on to the main event. If you are into high quality steak, they really feature the best of the best. True Japanese Waygu, 5 star American ribeye's, etc. Plus everything else you can ever want. I was there with 2 others. So we got the chateaubriand, the pork loin, and the lamb rack. The chateaubriand was excellent. Pork was served with apples and was over the top delicious. But then came the lamb...  The lamb, which was ordered medium rare, came out nearly raw. Honestly, I was shocked, especially considering the 5 star meals I have gotten from ever Jose Andres venture. But the staff handled it top notch. Every manager came out and apologized. They brought it back cooked properly. Bought us desert and gave us some asparagus on the house. So despite this rather shocking turn of events, it ended up ok.  Also shared a couple sides. The red peppers were some of the best ive ever had. They also featured something called Robuchon potatoes. Ok, please bare with me for a second while I go on  a slight completely spoiled foodie rants. So before ordering Robuchon potatoes, I called them out on this. I even told the waiter \"you guys must have a serious set of balls to call your mashed potatoes Robuchon potatoes.\" I say this because I have had the actual Robuchon potatoes and they are simply the most amazing potatoes I have ever had. So good that I refuse to believe anyone else can do them properly. The waiter said that the actual Joel Robuchon even gave his thumbs up after trying them.  Jose Andres' \"Robuchon\" potatoes arrived. They were really good. I am sorry to say, these were not as good as the real deal \"Robuchon\" potatoes. Don't get me wrong, these were also mind blowing. But they were not as good as the original. I suppose its like me saying I prefer my Lamborghini over my Ferrari. Someone should smack me around for complaining about this. Although I feel if you are going to use the term \"Robuchon\" you should be held that.   Lastly, the desert plate of a selection of various tarts and treats were al excellent.  One more thing to mention. The service was top notch as expected. Although I do feel that our waiter disappeared at times. When we wanted to complain about the lamb, it took us several minutes to track him down. I had to flag down a busboy from another table to get someone to help.  So there you go. Jose Andres took me on another culinary adventure I will never forget. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the lamb mess up and slightly lacking service made me knock off a star. There is no doubt I will go there again and give them another shot. I will probably need to mortgage my house to afford it, but I hope next time they can give me the 5 star experience that I expect.",

For the ones with young kids out there, you know how hard it is to get a good dinner without rushing.    Looked up best steak houses in Vegas and this one came up as winning awards, and a must try spot.  We got seated quickly with reservations through Opentable.  The restaurant is fancy but still casual enough where you don't feel uncomfortable.   Our waiter was outstanding and very informative on all the different cuts of meats and entrees.  We decided to share a Wagyu rib eye, pureed garlic mashed potatoes, beef tartare, and a salad.  Everything was amazing, probably the best steak I've ever had.  It was cooked perfectly and very tender.  The beef tartare was surprisingly very good, and the garlic mashed puree was a definately must try.  We are looking forward to coming back when in Vegas to try their other items.",

The food although a bit expensive was amazing! Each dish was a unique combination of flavors that cause you to close your eyes and savor the flavor. The presentation of each dish and restaurant ambiance is picture worthy.   At one point I had to ask for a drink twice because the server forgot- however she was sincerely apologetic and offered a free dessert to make up for the faux pas. In addition to the complimentary dessert, the manager Pano, also came by to apologize and offer an additional discount. He also sent my husband a personal email welcoming us back!   I can't imagine how difficult it is to run a high caliber restaurant like this, and understandingly things do go wrong. However I'm of the opinion that you can't control things from going wrong but you can control how you deal with it... And I doubt anyone could've dealt with it better!   Our experience here was pleasant and memorable- we will definitely return!",

    "text": "I've been to a few different Jose Andres restaurants (Cleo, Bazaar Beverly Hills), so we were really excited to try Bazaar Meat!  The ambiance is pretty unique, with the strange crocodile heads hanging over most of the tables.  My wife and I ordered a few drinks, then got the Jose's Way tasting menu ($185/person.)  Very pricey, but we've loved the other two restaurants, and we were paying with casino money this trip, so why not? :-)  The food was very similar to Bazaar in Beverly Hills.  Favorites were the Cotton Candy Foie Gras, Croquetas de Pollo (served in a shoe), Smoke and Ice Oysters (the smoke smells SO good), Beefsteak Tomato, Bison Buffalo Style and the cheese-filled air bread (I can't remember the name of this one, but when you bite into it and your hand is covered by delicious, boiling cheese, you'll know you found it.)  Honestly, everything we had was really good.  So why not 5 stars?  Well, the price really turned us off.  Yeah, I know we got a steak, and it was really good, and we had 12 courses and a few drinks, but $500 for 2 of us?  A very similar spread minus the steak ran around $250-300 at Bazaar, and we can EASILY stuff ourselves for under $200 at Cleo.  So was the steak really worth $200?  I can't say it was.  What I CAN say, though, is It was definitely an experience, and we're both glad we tried it.  I just can't see spending that much of my own money when we had a similar experience at a sister restaurant.  I'll just have to be glad the craps tables afforded us a fun evening...",

    "text": "I had such a delightful experience at Bazaar Meats last night (in contrast to the horrendous experience I had at Picasso a couple days before) that I was compelled to write a review.  In particular I have to commend Pano and Elias for their exemplary service.  We last came to Bazaar meats a few months back.  Food then was great, though perhaps because they were busy, a couple dishes in our tasting menu had been overlooked.  We weren't really bothered by it, but did ask our server when we'd see the courses.  Not only were they profusely apologetic, but they gave us a complimentary glass of wine AND took one tasting menu off our bill.  Pano gave me his card and said to let him know if we would be willing to try them again.  Fast forward till last night and friends who were coming to town suggested to meet at Bazaar Meats.  Remembering Pano's card, I sent him an email saying we'd be coming in and are looking forward to trying the restaurant again.  Pano replied promptly indicating he'd be pleased to welcome us personally at our reservation.  True to word, he was there to greet our table.  When it came time to order, we were provided great recommendations by our server Elias, and quite unexpectedly, they also brought out a number of complimentary dishes.  Overall I find Bazaar Meats to have stronger appetizers than mains, but everything is worth trying at least once to determine your favourites.  The must-orders for me are :  Cotton Candy Foie Gras S'mores (more foie gras with marshmallow, chocolate and thin graham wafer) Croquetas (Both Jamon and Pollo were delicious) Gazpacho Classic tartare Tomato tartare Buttered Potato Puree  What was amazing about the experience was that every aspect of our evening was great.  Everyone was attentive, food was delicious and and they repeatedly went above and beyond.  Bazaar Meats has been elevated to one of my top two places in Las Vegas and I will absolutely be returning.  I've already been recommending this restaurant to as many friends as I can!  They deserve it.",

Highlights: the black angus steak from Rosewood TX counterbalanced to the vaca vieja. For starters don't miss the cotton candy foie gras (trust me) and the Reuben.   The vaca vieja is a totally different type of steak than what Americans are used to so be warned. It's very aged and very lean thus much chewier than us Americans are used to but it was tasty.   The potatoes Delmonico was excellent but steer clear of the cauliflower. Not sure if it's supposed to be \"charred\" but ours was and not in a good way.  Should have gone with the carrots which are reportedly fantastic.   The food service was spotty but the friendly and attentive waiters certainly made up for it.  And don't skip dessert. Perfect bites of heaven for a perfectly sweet ending.",

    "text": "WOW, this was definitely a meal worth documenting in the books. My family and I came one night for dinner, and the experience, food, and service were absolutely amazing.   The restaurant is literally like an upscale butcher shop and kitchen, where there's a meat counter and grill in the center of the restaurant. The meat counter is where you see all the types of meats displayed, and choose the type and weight of steak wanted. The restaurant emphasizes family style dining, and uses very whimsical approaches to food.   We started the meal with some appetizers: 1. Foi gras with cotton candy- an interesting concept, but I wasn't too much a fan. The Foi gras was super small, and it tasted like a piece of salt with cotton candy.  2. Chicken Croquettes (that come in a shoe!)-this was delicious! Cheesy, crunchy, and filled with a rich chicken flavor.  3. The air bread- the best appetizer of the bunch! It literally tasted like a savory, cream puff filled with cheese.   My family decided on a 3lb Wagyu/ Angus cut and the Turbo fish as our meats, and both came out to be amazing. Expect the cook time to be around 40 minutes, but the meats are well worth the wait. The steak came sliced and cooked perfectly to medium rare, and the flavor was amazing. They use a very simple seasoning, which really allows the favor of the meat to shine through. The turbo was also very good, and I was surprised by how delicious the grilled fish came out to be; it was tender, and the charred fish skin was delicious.   We also got an assortment of pastries and cakes for dessert, and they were all small sized which was nice. All of their pastries aren't too sweet, and there's a great variety to choose from the small cart that they roll to each table.   I would highly recommend the experience here! The ambiance and service are remarkable, and it really became a highlight of my trip to Vegas.",

Service was impeccable. We never wanted for anything and our waiter seemed genuinely excited that we were having such a great time. Everyone was friendly and helpful.   The wine list was extensive and had interesting choices. My merlot blend (by the glass) had a complex flavor profile that I enjoyed to the last sip.   The kitchen is open and it's very easy to see all of the dishes coming out. Watching people at their various stations turn out beautiful food was so fun.

    "text": "So here's the low down. This is one of those restaurants either you hate the concept or you embrace and love the concept. The preparation and presentation is pretty bazaar as in its restaurant name. This place is also known for their tapas, but Believe Me, they are Really small plates at a hefty price.  So if you're not impressed by the presentation, by the small portion size, and by the price you'll be disappointed because the food is pretty standard.  As for myself I've given this place a couple tries. The first time around we tried a little bit of everything based on the server's recommendation. We had the endive salad, king crab & shrimp cocktail, vittore carpaccio, live scallops, gazpacho shots (compliments of the chef), jamon croquettes, the magic mojito (gimmicky melt the cotton candy type of drink), and a couple of desserts. I didn't understand what the high ratings were about?! After all, I did come here based on the yelp reviews and I was a bit disappointed with my experience. Every dish was mediocre, but eventually decided to give it another try....  Second time around I figured maybe we should try the steak since we didn't try it the first time. So we went with the Rosewood, TX wagyu (over 2lbs, bone is included in the weight, $75/lb), button mushrooms, scallops, delmonico potatoes, a couple wines, chicken croquettes, & don't be lemon drink which was served table side with dry ice.  I was really hoping to enjoy this time around given that we were trying out different dishes, but my experience was still the same as the first. One thing I truly enjoyed were the button mushrooms. Super juicy & rich in flavor! As for the steak it was over seasoned making it way too salty, but it was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a nice char on the outside.   Each time, we've spent $300+ and have walked out with our tummies feeling unsatisfied.   Besides the food I do commend the fabulous service they have here.",

They will also happily accommodate a tasting menu for a table of one, unlike some restaurants (such as the arrogant Wing Lei at Wynn) that will not.  My only suggestion is that if you are interested in going, do so sooner than later.  I was there on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was packed (a good sign).  But the SLS hotel was a ghost town.  Maybe the hotel picks up a bit on weekends, but word on the street is that it is struggling to maintain services and may soon be facing new ownership or closure.  If so, could Bazaar Meat survive at a new location?  Perhaps.  But why chance it?  Go now and enjoy!",

No drink or appetizer order was taken as We sat patiently for 20 minutes and then just became irritated as the party next to us received drinks and their appetizer after appetizer were brought to the table.  Look we get it the big party was his paycheck for the evening but, This was a special trip for us as we were celebrating a promotion for my wife.  This is Not the Service you would expect from a dining experience that is a minimum of $200 a person.  This was very disappointing to say the least as this was not the start we had in mind to our night.  The manager Pano did try to make it right when we got up and walked out and asked if he could reseat us somewhere, but we felt it would be too hard to enjoy ourselves after what we just experienced.  What a bummer as eating at an establishment such as this is not something we do all the time and This is something we plan for and for it to end like it did was just not how we envisioned our experience.  ****Since this review Pano the manager has reached out to us and was very apologetic and offered us to come back.  He is very professional and courteous individual and really wants his guest to have an experience they will never forget.  Hopefully someday we will be back in town to get give it another try.",

Needless to say, would certainly recommend dining at Bazaar, you will not be disappointed.",

So I was expecting similar here at Bazaar.  But the steak tasted like a normal steak. Nice enough but not as drastically different as eating wagyu or Vaca Vieja which are both profoundly different  Dessert options are very limited and underwhelming for a high end place",

I'm not going to go over every dish, because there are a lot, but everything was incredibly tasty. The meats, the seafood, the veggies and the drinks all hit the spot. Even though we were pretty adventurous, even ordering dishes with ingredients that I'd usually avoid, not a single dish missed the mark.   Obviously this place is pricey, so as long as you go in ready to spend, it's definitely worth it.",

    "text": "The food at Bazaar Meat is 5 stars, easily one of the best meals I've ever had but the service was pretty lack luster so I couldn't give Bazaar Meat 5 stars.  Came in for a birthday dinner on 9/7 with a party of 8 and we feasted hard. I think we had about half the menu, our server was told a price point and the food that was delivered did not disappoint.  At first there was confusion about one of the members of our party. Our server thought he was vegetarian but he just didn't want steak. So a few too many vegetarian items were sent out as filler which we ate but it was a tad overboard.   Pre-bussing was pretty scarce throughout the meal, plates were only cleared when the next course was being presented and even then many plates were left on the table throughout service.   Our server pushed the house favorite steak from Rosewood ranch I believe. For a $60+ per pound steak it had good flavor but was still pretty tough for being medium rare and we did not enjoy it. Wait staff was made aware that we didn't like the steak but a manager never did a table touch to address the concern.   The other steak we ordered which I can't pronounce but it's about $90 a pound was delicious and the table devoured it.  Our server had other tables so we knew he was kind of busy but the lack of attention to a table that's spending over $250 per person was kind of a let down. With an automatic 20% grat I guess he figured he didn't have to try too hard.  After an amazing dessert presentation for the birthday boy we sat around for a bit and passed around presents. The waiter didn't stop by or check on us after that for near an hour till we could finally flag him down to close out.  It really left a bad taste in everyone's mouth after a great meal.    We were at bazaar meats for 4 hours when it really should have been 3. The wait still need to learn to ask for help if they are overwhelmed so that the guest experience doesn't suffer.",

I am more of a fish gal however my husband is a red meat loving man and literally talked about going here for weeks before we got to Vegas. This is one of the only restaurants that has True wagyu Kobe beef. Which is from the Kobe region of Japan and cuts like butter.   Our server was super awesome, he took my husband all around and let him hand pick his own steaks. He also brought us a little tray of cured meats to try. This really made our experience special because we wanted to try everything!!! It was obvious he could tell how excited my husband was. Which I thought was sweet and meant a lot to us.   I of course, (being a fish lover) ordered the Turbot, I didn't realize how big this fish was which was maybe my fault. I only ate about 1/5 of my meal which had me feeling V sad to let it go to waste. He told me it was a whole fish, but I didn't know how big we were talking. A Turbot is an odd looking fish but it cooks very well and taste amazing.  Just don't google pics they are not cute they are bizarre for sure.  My Husband tried 4, 1oz pieces of wagyu and ordered an entire 2LB bone in steak. He ate every single bite.  We also got the cotton candy foie gras which is out standing and you do need to eat it all in one bite.  We had a stellar dining experience here which was all made amazing due to our server, he really took great care of us and make us feel special. We would like to be his friend. Lol!!!   Anyways, if you go, do your research prior to, it's a big menu and it's not cheap so know what you want to invest in and ask about portion size. So you can enjoy every single bite.",

For starters, we DID the cotton candy fois gras. Yes, you heard that correctly. It's a mini cotton candy stick with a fois gras center that is both sweet and savory...you just have to try it!   We were also treated to complementary chicken croquettes served in a glass dish shaped like a shoe. Why a shoe? Because young Jose used to get yelled at by his mother for putting his feet up on the kitchen table while waiting for his food, so he thought it would be funny to serve his mother's recipe in a literal shoe. It's these kinds of small touches that add personality to what would otherwise be just another expensive steakhouse.   On to the main course: THE MEAT!! I got the skirt steak, 8oz so a pretty good size, with a rosemary mustard sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection and delicious, especially with the sauce! I also got asparagus with Romesco sauce as a side and it was the perfect accompaniment.   If I were to go back I would definitely try the s'mores sandwich (featuring, you guessed it, fois gras). What is this guy's obsession with duck? Although pricey it was a great experience and, if you visit Vegas and you're craving a great steakhouse please try it!",

Instead of what you're used to, they bring out Caesar salad sliders in a way. They are bite size pieces of lettuce with the salad toppings on them. They had a very strong taste and I didn't eat more than one bite.   The picture I posted of the fried food in a shoe was brought to us by the waiter because there were two other items we ordered that we didn't like and he said he felt bad. I absolutely hate wasting things but they just were not good. However, the item in the shoe (a potato I think) was alright but I wouldn't order it.   The steak and potatoes were delicious! The filet comes sliced and was super tender. The potatoes were creamy and there's enough to share. The waiter explained that the steak would take some time but it ended up taking 90 minutes to get our dinner. I eat at nice steak houses almost weekly and that's outrageous!  The dessert cart was super cute but after how long it took for dinner, I was ready to leave so we skipped dessert.",

Thinking it'd be a better alternative than a la carte, we ordered the tasting menu. The big drawback to this option was that it took Almost 3 hours to eat and there was some waiting in between the courses. It would have been nice to be forewarned on the time, but it was also a weekend evening. The menu did provide a good survey of many dishes on the menu, and the waiters always eloquently introduced each course. The decor and drinks are swanky, but also inter-spliced  with game heads and Mardi Gras beads on the wall. Interesting approach! Try Bazaar if you don't mind a new age approach to the average steakhouse. Don't go expecting a typical Old school style wine and dine steakhouse.",

Whether you're on a date night or you're here for a business meeting, the restaurant has an amazing layout to accomodate people of all backgrounds. They have an open kitchen where you can see the fresh meats and the staff working hard pumping tapas out one after another.  Known for fine dining, Jose Andres has a reputation to uphold. These tapas are some of the best tapas you'll ever have. For starters, there is nothing I love more than their Kobe airbread. It's very light. When you take a bite, you'll notice the bread deflates and the cream filling comes out. They are $12 a piece. Each piece will get you around 2-3 bites. We also really enjoy their cotton candy foie gras, Jose's tacos, the deli meat platter, and the beef tartar. They serve their tartar here with rolls. The other locations serve with a crunchy cone and I prefer that. However people definitely come here for their steaks. They do live up to their name. They have so many cuts of steaks and can tell you how long they have been aged for. Their meats are of high quality and are very expensive.   Service here is my other favorite reason to dine here. They have amazing food but the service is just as spectacular. I can always find someone cleaning a plate for us, providing us with a refill, or asking us if there's something we need. Every time we've dined here, we've spoken to the manager. The manager makes his / her way around to all the tables to greet the guest. On our last visit, someone dropped off our tapa and didn't want to interrupt the conversation the manager was having with us. The manager made the individual come back to our table to introduce the tapa. They do a great job explaining each dish as they come. It's part of the experience.",

    "text": "Stayed at the SLS on a group outing back in June. During a discussion of which steakhouses we should check out a few kept coming back to the idea of trying something \"in-house.\" My friend Jaysen T. did research on Bazaar and kept the idea alive. Frankly I thought the guys lazy but when you are on vacation with guys wanting to spend monies on gambling rather than food... Just go where ever I guess.  The final headcount for dinner on a Monday evening was for two and between us we spent about $150 - $180 each.   Food. The memorable part of dinner was the cotton candy foie gras which I could have had seconds of. My buddy was weirded out by the concept but he's also not the type to try foie gras generally.  Many of the plates are portioned and cut to allow for easy grabbing/ sharing.   I'll save you from the play by play of shared starters, plates and selections of meat. Based on our ideas and those shared by the waiter, we ordered plenty for sharing. But final thoughts were that we could have gone elsewhere and had something tastier. Dinner was a let down. I don't mind shelling out some cash for a good meal. This did not satisfy.  The presentation and setup of the restaurant draws attention to the kitchen and grilling areas. If guests were to pick up their meats from the presentation area, that would really be something. Only a few moments are spent when entering and passing that area. To be able to view your cut of meat/meal cooked and plated... ie chef's table experience would be something. However, the flavors have to backup the associated costs..",

    "text": "So this place is in the old Sahara resort.  You better love meat when you come me here and if you do you will be greatly rewarded.   We started at the bar as we waited for our table.  Great drink options with unique cocktails.  I got a whiskey cocktail.  It was smoked and had great flavors.  It was not a long wait till we were seated.  The place was packed but I did not feel we were on top of the people next to us even though we did have conversations with those on either side.  Our server was prompt and offered good suggested for feasting.    We got the $125 tasting menu that had a bit of everything. I have to admit I thought it was really slow getting our food but when we did it was really good.    The brought us The Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron broken up table side.  I guess this was like a bread service.  We had so much of this left.    Then we had oysters that had a sea foam topping. They were very creative and very tasty.  Also the Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional Liquid green olive, gordal olives stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy was something very unique.  A liquefied olive with the normal stuffing.   We moved on to have multiple items, , Bison Buffalo style, Lucia's Salad with Endive Caesar salad, Parmesan, anchovy, air croutons, Bagels & Lox Cone with Dill cream cheese, salmon roe, Croquetas de Pollo made with Chicken-bechamel fritters.    The meat course was a Chateaubriand. Tenderloin Brandt Beef, CA, Holstein, Perigord sauce, pomme souffle.  Of course it was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  potatoes and asparagus as sides were perfect.    Our final experience was a dessert of Cream puffs, assorted tarts, little cakes.  A nice finish.    We had wine throughout the meal with a pairing at each serving.  We shared it to help keep money in our pockets and not get to drunk.  .     It was a great experience in food eating.  So many interesting foods and takes on familiar things.  Be prepared to spend a lot of money, over $300 if you follow what we did but consider it a dinner and a show as each course was like a new act in the Jose Andres show!!",

Firstly, I came here with my girlfriend to spend our anniversary in Vegas. The appetizers were good and the garlic mashed potatoes were very delicious. When my steak came out which I've ordered the ribeye taster; It was not a ribeye and I know my meats. It was a strip loin and it was really tough. I would rather go to another steak house restaurant who has better quality meat. Money isn't an issue but I would like the quality of meat that I pay for to be up to par. I will definitely not be coming here again with the quality of meat that came out on my dinner plate. I hope everyone else who reads this has a better experience than what we had. It was very disappointing also they dont have any special desserts for certain occasions.",

Am a huge fan of Jose Andres and was happy to head out to SLS to try it! Great atmosphere, not a romantic restaurant, and set up for parties of all sizes. Good spacing and love the open grills and meat displays as you enter.  It's pricey so bring your wallet. Food and service were all top notch. Creative cotton candy type cocktails too! We did a mix of 3 starters, 2 meats and a side and were stuffed. Had to skip dessert. Absolutely loved the jamon croquetas - have not had anything better since leaving Spain! The Ferran Adria olives (copy of the El Bulli/Tickets one) were a disappointment if you've had the real thing. Would not order them again - not bad, just not that spectacular. The sloppy joes were tasty with the crispy topping - different twist on a casual dish. Would skip this next time.  Loved our meats! The choices are somewhat overwhelming! The sausage with the pain con tomate is classic Spain. Loved this. The rib eye was more American but well flavoured and it's nice to sample a variety of meat here. The garlic mushrooms were a perfect side.  One of my favorite Vegas meals... and we come here annually! Will be back!",

Some memorable items (my mouth is watering as I type this):  Chef's selection of 6 cured meats - my favorite was the 4-year cured Jamon Iberico Foie Gras wrapped in fresh cotton candy Suckling pig Grilled Pulpo  Beef Carpaccio (maybe my favorite of the night!) - Washugyu beef, espuma and the best whipped parmesan puree you'll ever have Rosewood wagyu ribeye steak Jose's Asian Tacos - jamon iberico de bellota, toasted nori seaweed, flying fish roe  Yum.

I feel like even if you cook steak well, the taste just cant go above and beyond  Overall, good, don't hate that I came here, but I'm not itching to come back. If I factor in the high prices, I probably wouldn't recommend this place and be sad I came lol  1.Octopus - really good! came with a really tangy tomato-y vinaigrette that was almost too acidic, but I really enjoyed it. Octopus was cooked to perfection - it was charred but super tender. Some friends thought it was too charred but I didnt mind it 2. Chicken croquettes - compliments of the chef. Think a warm chicken salad (with shredded chicken) shaped like a mozarella stick and also fried like a mozarella stick. Good, but nothing I would pay for at a pricey restaurant 3. Wagyu / black angus steak from TX. Got 2 pounds for three people. We thought this was a decent amount of meat which was cooked to perfection. It's lightly seasoned, and comes with a small side bowl of nice salt so everyone can season it to taste. There were some fatty pieces, but overall a great steak   Good, attentive service - what you'd expect for a place like this and for the prices you're paying. Though I do think this high prices do reflect high quality meat as well as the celebrity chef name",

Right when you enter the restaurant you are welcome with the smell of grilled meat and a whole display of all their cuts of meats. The hostess was a sweet young lady who made us felt very welcome. We sat closer towards the bathroom so got to walk through the whole restaurant. I love the modern and sleek look of the place.   We order the chicharron and wasn't too satisfied with the dips it arrived with. I would have just loved some salsa or Tajin seasoning. The dip was a very bland, tart whipped Greek yogurt of some sort. It was lacking of flavor and the chicharron didn't have much seasoning to it either. The portion was huge though! We also ordered my fav Jose's take on the philly sandwich. I can eat ten of those mini sandwiches! We end up ordering their washugyu ribeye and it did not disappoint at all! It was aged and cooked perfectly! I'm not really a big steak gal, but my first bite left me wanting more. It was an explosion of juicy meaty flavor. I loved every bite of it! We also order the desserts, but I would recommend skipping on it. It was pricey for bite size portions and none really left me wanting more.",

Don't worry about what it is, it is an experience you won't regret - Purees potatoes were like spoonfuls of cream and butter - Sloppy joes. Ok these were my favorite.

It's just for shock value... That can't work.  Well it's does. At the center is buttery rich foie gras wrapped in a simple cloud of cotton candy. Once you put it in your mouth the cotton candy melts forming a crispy layer over the foie gras and takes on this amazing roasted flavor. It's like a magic trick you want to try to figure out because it's so good. This absolutely blew my mind.  The experience was centered around the food but we were guided through the gastro journey with background stories of the chef or the food. The service was wonderful but the stories linked our experiences to the amazing flavors and textures we were partaking in.    Wow. Will want to find something similar back home.

    "text": "We came with friends to celebrate my wife's b'day. We really wanted to like Bazaar Meat, mainly because we are fans of Jose Andres. The restaurant is located in the far corner of the casino, away from the parking. Immediately on walking in, you are struck by the beautiful cuts of meat in the display case. Then the huge open grills with the meats cooking (lots of heat and great aromas). Very elegant ambiance despite the lack of table cloths. Michael, our server, was at our table immediately after we were seated. Very welcoming and super helpful in deciding what to order. We decided on 4 apps, 2 meats, and one side. We started with Jose's Asian Tacos ($16). Five small rectangles of seaweed topped with a very very thinly sliced piece of Iberian ham and some fish roe. The flavor of the seaweed overwhelmed the ham and fish roe. enjoyable but not special. The Pulpo Gallega ($22) is grilled octopus slices with small grilled potatoes in a light pimento sauce. It is a small plate but easily shared by the four of us. delish! Next came the Sloppy Joe ($12). While the menu stated it was on a steamed bun, it tasted fried. Stuffed with beef boldness and topped with a small amount of fried straw potatoes. Easily shared and very tasty. The last app was the Cotton Candy Foie Gras ($8). Very impressive presentation but I didn't taste it (really not easily shared). For our entrees, we got the Wagyu Black Angus from Rosewood Texas ($78/lb) and the Chateaubriand ($75/lb). The Wagyu is presented sliced with the bone on the side. I found it much too fatty to be enjoyable but my wife enjoyed it. The Chateaubriand  was also served sliced with a Perigord sauce on the side. This was tender and flavorful. With impressive ambiance and excellent service, why only 3 stars? The food should be knock your socks off quality in a restaurant of this level. While the apps were really special, the entrees were just good, but not special. I'm glad I tried it but I won't be returning.",

I was slightly disappointed that this wasn't the same Bazaar concept as the one in Beverly Hills, CA. BUT Jose Andres can do no wrong in my eyes. The bar is absolutely beautiful very tall ceilings and huge! this bar could probably sit up to 50 people I'd say. Nicole was our bartender and boy was she a character. Very funny and sweet. I started out with a Pisco Sour (my favorite cocktail) and it was pretty damn good. Its so hard to find a bartender that can make a great Pisco Sour. Andy had a scotch drink but i cannot remember what it was called.  We had a dozen oysters to start, wow they were amazing. we loved how small they were. It seems the smaller the oyster the more fresh they taste. Then we moved on to the Sloppy Joe sandwich. This was truly tasty, beef bolognese, fried straw potatoes, on a steamed bun. Cant go wrong with that!  We finished our little snack with a few Tahitian Vanilla cream puffs. I will seriously come back for those. Amazing.   All in all we had a great experience here and will be back for an actual dinner.",

    "text": "Do not be mistaken. This is not a steak house. This is a carnivores' den. Everything is mismatched, disorganized, chaotic and oh-so-beautiful. Bazaar does an elegant spin on disheveled and it works. The chairs don't match, the tables are all different in one area to the next, the chandeliers aren't the same. But that's the fun of dining here. We had a double birthday for 7 people were seated at the \"game of thrones\" table. Medieval iron chandelier, colossal chairs and mounted game heads on the walls. Upon arrival, take note to visit the 4 open kitchens! The meat cabinet is the most interesting. The seafood kitchen is in the back room.   To suit the theme we ordered the quarter roast suckling pig (you can get a whole suckling pig too) which you can see hung in the glass display out front. This item is a must have since it made our steak take a back seat. There isn't anywhere that can do pig this tender and juicy. Mash potatoes were excellent to pair, which heirloom tomato salad which were very fresh. The one bite cotton candy foie gras is an experience on it's own. Creamy foie gras which the smooth texture blended is wrapped with a sweet grainy cotton candy. Just genius. Chicken croquettes were sent to the table compliments of the house which were a nice crispy kick to the meal as well. Would order on our own the next time. To complete, there was plentiful dessert (I had the chocolate matcha tea which was excellent) and smiles all around.  The whole experience tied together by excellent service who had the utmost patience for our wild and loud personalities and love from the very kind GM Yassine who did a fine job of making us feel very welcome. 6 stars if it were possible.",

We ordered two meats - rib eye and the suckling pig. Both were served on tall platters. It made it a little awkward not being able to see the person across the table. We kept ducking and giraffe necking to have conversations lol.   Anyways, for appetizers, we got the dozen oysters, charcuterie plate with bread, and sea urchin. The sea urchin is a must! I've never had sea urchin that good!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it again.  Our main course included the Rib steak (washugyu/angus). We ordered 2lbs, which included the bone, so as you can imagine... there wasn't very much meat. It came out pre-sliced but it was a little cold. Not very much flavor but still good. We also ordered the 1/4 suckling pig. It was amazing! Super crispy but fatty on the inside. I couldn't eat more than one piece though.   For sides, I can't remember exactly what they were but there was an apple/salad plate, potato dish, and a brussels sprout dish. They were all pretty tasty and helped balance out all the meat.  For dessert, we got an assortment of truffles, candy, creme puffs. Refer to the picture, can't remember what each of them were. I was a big fan of the hazelnut one. Tasted like a Ferrero Rocher creme puff!  Oh and can't forget the cocktails! First one I had was the cotton candy mojito! It was good but a little too sweet for me. The second was a hit! New York Sour! Get it!!!",

The staff is so nice and accommodating that they would probably help you move to a new home. It feels like a thousand tiny hugs. My snacks were magical and there are a thousand new menu items that I can not wait to try- as this is a different concept restaurant.  I love this restaurant.

My experience with LA Bazaar is - its absolutely fantastic, but its also $$$. I was pleasantly surprised with how reasonable the bar menu prices were. There were 5 to 7pm special drink menu all at $8 including red and white wine. The cocktail I ordered was their Cotton Candy Magic Mojito. It was amazingly delicious. I spent I think about $16 on this cocktail, and every drop of it was so worth it! Just a day ago, I spent my money at Libertine Social at Mandalay Bay and I wasn't super impressed, but this place won me over! I also got to try the liquid nitrogen based LN2 dont be a lemon drink ($10). and I ordered a cotton candy foie gras, which I remembered from my trip to LA Bazaar! $8 - it was as divine as I remembered! I do want to come back for a full on dinner in teh future! so even if you arent staying at SLS make Bazaar bar - your stop! no reservation needed at the bar area!",

    "text": "Yum!  Came here for Christmas Eve dinner with my family and was definitely not disappointed. We had to push our original 7:00 reservation to 8:00 and then to 9:00 due to traffic coming from LA, which they were completely accommodating of. When we arrived, they were running about half an hour behind (they seemed understaffed), so we started our apps and drinks at a 4-top table at the bar, which was fine.  --Foie gras cotton candy - my brother's favorite / must-have item, which they used to have at Bazaar in LA, prior to the California foie gras ban. I love foie gras, and I love cotton candy, but this item was just too strange for me. It wasn't bad, I just couldn't really wrap my head around what it was or what it was supposed to be.  --Classic tartare - really great herby flavor and high quality meat. Huge portion size for an appetizer. Comes served on a giant heavy marble tiered plate - the waitstaff must have very strong forearms!  --Can't remember what it was called, some kind of octopus - perfectly cooked and not chewy, with a delicious sensation of char that lingers   --Brussels sprouts - I remember these being good, but don't really remember the details of what it tasted like  --Smoke & ice fresh oysters - SO smoky, strange, and addictively delicious. Kind of confusing - the menu states that it's a \"half dozen..kushi\" oysters. We asked to confirm, and the waiter said they were actually kumamoto oysters that evening, which was fine with us. When the order arrived, there were 5 orders, and we asked \"wasn't it supposed to be a half dozen?\" and he said that's how they come. .. what?  --Braised lamb neck - so tender, so flavorful, so rich, and not at all gamey. You don't even need a knife.   Our server, Sunday (sp?), was really friendly and helpful.   This is a really great restaurant and I will definitely be coming back for special occasions and date nights in the future.   The only few things that will probably prevent me from giving this 5 stars in the future.. 1. half a dozen means 6, not 5, so it's really disappointing when something comes out with fewer items than you were expecting. I would probably still pay the same amount for 5 oysters, but if you say half a dozen, serve half a dozen.  2. a lot of the menu items are borrowed from Jose Andres' other restaurants (and I don't just mean the Bazaar in LA). For example, the croquetas de pollo are also served at Jaleo at the Cosmo. The Pa Amb Tomaquet at Bazaar meat is exactly the same as the Pan de Cristal con Tomate at Jaleo as well. I'm sure if I look more carefully I will find more overlap. The salt air margarita is also found at China Poblano. Though these two particular dishes are, admittedly, two of my go-tos at Jaleo, I think this is just plain lazy!",

I was under the impression by the waitress that we were having 10 completely different desserts.   I didn't end up taking a second bite of any of the desserts. They weren't bad but nothing pleased my palette.   The cream puffs were dry and cream filling uninteresting. I don't remember the truffles other than the earl grey which was the best out of the 3. None of the tarts worked for me. I liked the passion fruit tart until I got to the banana strawberry tasting yogurt at the bottom. If it was filled with just passion fruit I would have liked it. Chocolate raspberry tart needed less raspberry and more chocolate. The dessert sampler is a good idea because of the variety it offers but each individual dessert is not good on it's own.   The presentation of the desserts far exceeded the taste of the desserts.",

He also showed us the other tasting menus that had \"value\" for 150$ and 200$ a person. His definition of \"value\" goes in his pocket with a tip. Ha!  Anyways there was plenty of great grub centered around an entree of roasted filet, robuchon potatoes,and grilled asparagus with romesco sauce.   Probably the most fun thing to east was the giant chicharon and yogurt mousse with sumac. We got to break it to bits with a mallet!  I'm not gonna let the initial attitude from the server weigh me down. He warmed up after a bit and we didn't camp all night at the table. I would recommend simply on this menu.",

Please be warned that you need an extremely long time blocked out to eat here if you plan on eating a steak.  We were here for dinner for over three hours!  It wasn't the fact that meal took so long but there was an extremely long lull in between some of our small plates and the larger entrees.  So long that it felt awkward!  The food overall was good but not great and I recommend eating at one of the many delicious establishments in Las Vegas.    However, one redeeming quality of Bazaar Meat was the service.  Our service was amazing and charismatic.  He deserves every dollar of that $300+ tip that he received.  The steaks were good but not great (the entire table agreed that Del Frisco was better for steaks).  However, someone at our table did get the rack of lamb and it was probably one of the best rack of lambs that I\"ve ever tasted.    Also, if you like traditional oysters, stay away from the smoke and ice oysters.  I didn't think it was tasty at all and I absolutely love oysters.  The presentation was neat and dramatic but not worth the price.",

We had to ask the busboy about an appetizer that it appears the waiter forgot about and he helped us out instead. At one point I caught the waiter's attention and as he was coming towards me he gestured for me to wait and then went out of his way to help the larger table instead. To add to the trend he took a long time to refill our water. I understand that being a waiter is a tough job and that he stood to make a lot more money at the other table, but when you are paying the prices you are at this place you expect to be treated well, not as an afterthought.  The food is just okay. I like the suckling pig, but I wouldn't recommend it for parties of two. Even the small quarter portion was too much for us. It is just too oily and fatty to eat so much of it.  The other dishes were alright, but nothing special.   Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant. It is a shame because I was really looking forward to eating here, but yeah, save your money and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I am going to go out on a limb and say that this is actually one of the few restaurants on the Strip that is NOT overrated. Located inside the SLS Las Vegas, this is a very nice place to wine and dine and impress your guests.  Like the name implies, this is a meat-centric establishment.The very first display is a Japanese Wagyu Beef certification statement that explains the grade of Wagyu used and it's authentication at Bazaar meat. As soon as you start walking towards your table, you will see the magic happening. It's like a live show of meats being cooked constantly in front of you and the various cuts before cooking. Although this place serves more than just steaks, you should really try a cut of something if this is your first time here.  I do recommend trying any one of their salads. The presentation and arrangement of these salads are very unique and of course, very tasty. Additionally with your steak (of which I assume you're having), try the Robuchon potatoes. I'm gonna use the word 'dangerous' when describing this stuff. Also, 'incredible'. The desserts here are the only items that didn't really amaze me but they were still good. The outstanding wine selection will round out your evening.  This place isn't cheap. If you get a full course dinner, you can run your bill up around $200 per person. To help you out, The SLS and this restaurant have a relationship with BMW of Las Vegas, and you can get a $100 coupon at this restaurant from the dealership when you purchase a new BMW. Enjoy your evening here. I don't mind going to the strip for this place.",

We saw the menu beforehand and already knew what to expect in regards to price. We knew what we wanted but didn't expect the preparation of our steak to take 50 minutes. We would've known if we read these reviews first.  Our order consisted of: Bagel and lox - okay (2 bites) Reuben - okay (2-3 bites) Sloppy Joe - I actually really enjoyed it (came with 2 servings) Bison carppacio - okay (5 slices) Chateaubriand steak, 1lb, med-rare - excellent Cauliflower steak - excellent  The dinner came with air bread, which is pretty much air puffed potato chips. If your diet or religious beliefs prevent you from eating pork, you may want the waiter/waitress to find out if they rub any pork fat juice on the steak. My husband noticed our steak had a little bit of a bacon flavor.  Great service, long wait for main entree, pricey appetizers, different experience...",

Atmosphere is really nice in addition with low lighting. Our server was on point since the moment we sat down. We ordered two beers and started off with some fresh oysters. By far the best oysters I've ever had. Really fresh and ice cold! We ended up ordering about 3 dozen of them! That's how good they were. We also had the Lucia salad and two of the buttered potato puree. I was skeptical about the puree part, but it's definitely the best potatoes I've had. The Lucia salad was also tasty, the freshness and crunch was a breath of fresh air. I definitely recommend. We also had the king crab cocktail. Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. That's all I'll say. I love crab and seafood in general, so I'm always looking for freshness when it comes to seafood. For another side we had the Grilled Asparagus, the grilled flavored mixed with the bedded romesco sauce was a great blend. Last but not least, the Bone-In Strip Loin Grass Fed Angus. MEDIUM RARE. Amazing! The most juiciest tender meat seasoned to perfection. I'm definitely looking to go back soon. I'll be in Vegas in September with some family, hopefully we can get a chance to drop in. At least for the freshest oysters in town! We also got offered desert on the house from the Manager Pano, which by the way was such a great offer. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed from all the oysters and steak, we had to respectfully decline. Without a doubt we'll be back to try it. With great gratitude, the experience and flavors were immaculate in all ways.",

On the night in question, we had great service from Natalie, the server-who-used-to-be-a-gymnast. She truly was one of the best servers we've had in ages. However, the food was atrocious. Overpriced and terrible quality--low-grade dog food at best. I wasn't impressed with anything that we ordered. My wife said she felt ill after eating her meat--it was truly low quality. As for the service? It was TERRIBLE before Natalie saved us! We sat at our table for 40 minutes before being served! One of the busboys gave us attitude when we finally asked him to get our server. I wish I'd gotten his name. He was tall with dark hair, fairly well built, with a negative attitude that made me want to teach him a lesson (but he was twice my size and ten times less my intellect, so I refrained). The other servers and busboys could have cared less that we were sitting there unserved for nearly an hour. Natalie was the only good point--she truly tried to make the situation right. Plus we had great entertainment watching a bunch of men from the car wash convention next door romancing a bunch of young women at the table next to ours. The guys all had nice, shiny wedding rings on their fingers and were about 40-50 years old. The women were in their twenties, dressed scantily, and clearly unmarried...take a guess. Like I said, great entertainment but certainly not worth much when the food was so bad. I definitely won't be going back, and I'll be sure to spread the word.",

However,  we chose Bazaar for dinner and it was not only the highlight of our night, but one of the better dining experiences we've had. Not only was the food incredible,  but the service was second to none.  Our server Nick was not only devilishly handsome, but incredibly friendly and accommodating.  The sommelier, Lou, is one of the most fascinating people I have spoken with,  and gave us some mind blowing wine recommendations and food pairings. We ended up with a bottle of wine my boyfriend had been searching for for 8 years, and he even knew where we could buy it! We were so thrilled we asked for the GM, Chris, who stopped by and chatted with us for a bit. He was gracious and down to earth,  and gave us a small tasting of a few of their charcuterie options. It was an amazing dining experience,  and I will most definitely be back.",

First of all, we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation, the restaurant had a lot of empty tables and we were led to the very back, in a small room at the farthest point of the restaurant.   I thought we were being escorted out of the restaurant.   This was already a bad sign for me and I almost wanted to ask our group to leave but everyone was hungry. We ordered the bread with tomato spread, Kobe beef, a total of 4 lbs of ribeye (the server told us we HAVE TO ORDER A MINIMUM OF 2 POUNDS for EACH ribeye) for the 4 of us, mashed potatoes and baby corn with cheese.      Check out the photo of the steak, does that look like it's 2 pounds?????  And we got 2 of those to make 4 pounds). Everything was just ok, the rib eye steaks were under seasoned and not that tender, the Kobe beef, what??????  I practically blanched it on that hot plate and it was not as tender as I EXPECTED it would be.    The Wagyu beef that I buy from Bristol farms is a lot more tender!   Very disappointed overall.   I would have given 1 1/2 stars for service but that was being too generous.  Would I recommend this restaurant?   Would I come back?  Probably NOT!",

It's kind of like a typical online date:great match on paper, but no chemistry in person.  That's how Jose Andres and I are. *Luckily, I was with my boyfriend, so who cares about Jose.   Pros:  I liked the cocktails. I liked the bar ambiance.  The oysters worked.  I liked that my super handsome date could sit next to me.   Cons: The food came out in a weird order.  We were warned, but it still seemed odd to have to wait for side dishes of a steak.   We were early for our reservation,  but still had to wait. It was off putting, considering there were many empty tables. Also, our table was kind of lonely and far away from the action it seemed (except for the one drunken table directly in front of us).    Overall....a typical Vegas restaurant.",

    "text": "We had high hopes for our dinner at Bazaar Meat - we read the reviews and have really enjoyed other Jose Andres restaurants in the past. Unfortunately, this meal was the low spot of our trip for the following reasons: - Service was slow/inattentive - we had to ask for water (tap) several times, plus our wine didn't get served on time for our entrees - Pacing of the dishes was off - we had several dishes arriving at once, so it was hard to enjoy everything while it was still hot. This was after we asked about pacing when we ordered. - Terrible wagyu dish - out server said that they braise it for something like 20 hrs. It tasted like overcooked liver. We sent it back.  - Vegetable dishes were under-seasoned and not cooked evenly - The dining room was super hot - we understand that it's an open fire cooking place, but other places like Metropole in Cincinnati do this without make the entire place into an inferno - Our check ended up having the wine from the table next to us on it - it was corrected, but without much apology or concern given that it was a $150 bottle  That said, there were a few great dishes - classic tartare, giant chicharone, and the foie gras cotton candy. While they were quite good, they weren't good enough to balance out the negatives of the meal. It's a shame - we loved Jaleo earlier in the week. We'll just stick with that place from now on - it's consistently exceptional.",

    "text": "Nick has been my waiter the many times I've been to Bazaar Meats, and I'd change my reservation to another date/time to get him every time. He's patient, knows food, knows the 3-8 menus you'll look at while you're there (crazy number of menus!!!), and he'll ensure you have the perfect experience.   Start with the gin & tonic. I'm not even a gin & tonic gal and it's one of my favorite drinks of all time, but only from Bazaar Meats. Start there and then find the right wine pairings for your meal. There is a page of wine by the glass to choose from, not a ton, but if you're the only one wanting wine all you need is a glass or two. Let's be real - you'll need red wine to go with your meats.   Automatically order the cotton candy foie gras when you order your drinks. It's like a bite of sweet whimsical butter. Your tastebuds will be inspired. Then you've got time to be walked through the menu with your senses engaged.   Don't even peruse the menu(s) until your waiter walks you through them. It's overwhelming. If you're a first timer - start with a tasting menu. They normally have 3 tasting menus at $150, $200, or $275. The $200 is my go-to, main difference between that one and the $275 is the sucking pig.   I forget what it's called but there is a table side sorbet you should get as a palette cleanser. It has booze in it, if I'm remembering correctly. Either way - this is more of a bonus than a must have.   These are my favorite items I've had: the croquettes de pollo, the carpaccio with Parmesan, the caviar flight, the cold smoked oysters, Chateaubriand, sucking pig, grilled pulpo (octopus), classic tartare, geoduck.   I won't go through all the veggies, but they're all good. You must order their mashed potatoes, as in must. Did I mention must. Go ahead and get 2 orders if you've got more than 3 hungry people.   Desserts - yes please. Just get whatever you're feeling and you'll be happy.   My least favorite orders are few, but they weren't worth the ordering in my experience. The chicharron was a giant mess of fried pig skin. It gets everywhere and is forgettable. The other disappointment was the Lindsay Ranch. It's pricey and the flavor was mild. For $95/lb there are better items on the menu.   I feel like I always end describing the decor. It's the fat kid in me. I love the feel and appeal of Bazaar Meats. It's a mix between somehow glitzy random as hell and a hunting expedition. You'll see.",

    "text": "I love Jose Andres but perhaps my expectations were just a bit too high.  Bazaar Meats emphasizes their massive cuts of meat and 3 pound ribeyes, but Jaleo does many of the same or similar sides and apps better. I'd go back to Jaleo for better versions of everything except the meat dishes. Come hungry and leave the vegetarians at home.  DRINKS Jose's G&T is always a good start, but the LN2 (more like an alcoholic sorbet than a drink) comes with fun tableside presentation. Did not care for Jose's Vespa or the Hemmingway.  STARTERS & SIDES Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional: Got these again after loving the concept at Jaleo, but they were not as appreciated by our dining companions *The Classic Tartare: easily one of the best dishes we had, one I would come back for. Made tableside and seasoned to your preference, the beef sirloin comes from retired dairy cows and is supremely flavorful.  Vittore 1950 Carpaccio: accidentally received this after ordering the bison buffalo version, but kept it. A well-done classic with parmesan, croutons, capers, and sherry. I would still like to try the buffalo version eventually. The Lhardy's Madrid Beef (soup): served in a tiny teacup, the consomme, quail egg, sherry, and caviar were underwhelming. Wouldn't get this again, it doesn't really work, and I don't understand why it's on the menu. A simple tomato salad: There is such a thing as being too simple. Three or four cubes of various sweeter tomatoes, plus a light dressing and red onion. I liked the unusual selection of tomatoes but this dish seemed to be missing something.  *S'mores: Homemade graham crackers and marshmallows plus chocolate and foie gras? This was a surprise hit with our more conservative dining partners! Should have asked for this at the end of the meal as it was better than the desserts we had and less fittingly placed as a starter course.  MEATS Merino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: The version at Jaleo is better. This was unevenly seasoned, rendering some of the chops almost bland. The chimmichurri sauce Jaleo's version is plated with would have elevated this dish. *Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Tender and flavorful meat was complemented by the citrus and slightly-spicy mojo rojo, which I wish there was more of (as others have said). Good choice. *Braised Lamb Neck: Perfectly medium-rare lamb, juicy and well seasoned, plus fried oysters and fried potatoes. The oyster catsup was unnecessary because all of the other components were so well done. Recommend!  DESSERT Everything is itty-bitty bite-sized, making our usual habit of sharing dessert difficult. The tiramisu creme puff disappointed the person who chose it, while the raspberry yuzu tart was interesting and fun. By far the favorite was the sea salt caramel crisp.   Service was friendly and informative, if a touch too casual. The tableside presentation was fun, and the guy who worked with us was personable. Note that there are three (great-sounding) tiered tasting menus, from $150/pp to $275, this information is not present on the website.  Part of having the best experience here is going with the right group of people, and unfortunately the couple we dined with didn't seem to enjoy many of the items. My rating is rounded up to 4 stars from what is more accurately 3.5, as that is partially my fault. Less than half of our dishes (admittedly mostly classic options) were wonderful, while the other half was disappointing. I'll come back to split a steak with my guy (and try the cotton candy foie!), but I'm not in a rush to do so.",

    "text": "Might be my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas right now.  Super unique experience. I compared the feeling I felt, walking in to the first time I walked into a multi-course preset meal. I have been telling my friends that I was brought, back to the first time I dined at the French Laundry, or Masa, and Nobu.   I tingled.  The food was excellent, and, was very unique. Steakhouse + Tapas = Bazaar Meat. I'm not sure how else to describe it. Even though it's labelled as such, it didn't quite make sense until our meal started unfolding in front of us, like a really good book.  I fell in love with everything that was set in front of us. Highlights include the Cold Smoked Oysters, Liquid Olives (thinking about these 2, makes me come, a little), the matured meat (totally different flavor profile) and the play on a black forest dessert. We probably sampled a dozen+ items, all of which were great, at worst.  Unfortunately, I didn't feel like a cocktail when we sat, or with apps like I tend to do, so I feel like I missed out on a little of what my normal dining experience would be. (Well, maybe that's fortunate. It gives me more reason to return.)   I really can not wait to return... This restaurant has made dining in Vegas exciting to me, again. Lifetime bucket list has a new entry, and that is eat more Bazaar Meat.",

I've always loved the decor of Jose Andres restaurants, the colors and the layout of the spaces makes you want to explore.   Before I got any further, the way the food is ordered at the Meats compared to The Bazaar in BH is totally different. Meats is more like a order appetizers and Entree kinds style vs the BH restaurant it's more Tapa (small plates) style based. Meats does offer some of the same dishes.   The Service: Service was just ok, shortage of water was a problem. We kept asking for water vs. just getting check on by our waiter. We had an early appointment and the food turn around was slower than anticipated.   Food: Was good but for the price I was waiting for the Wow factor.   Conclusion, I'll be going to the Bazaar in Beverly Hills but not Bazaar Meat in Vegas. To bad, I really wanted to love this place.",

Presentation of it was nice. The Super Giant Pork-skin Chicharron - which was impressive by sight and taste! We had oysters, as well - which the ones fro the PNW were the best, IMO. We had the cured meats that were selected by our waiter and they were amazing, as well.  The greens salad was way better than we had expected and so we ordered an additional one.  Came here with family and we were all incredibly impressed with the food, service and drinks. There were 5 of us and we had the Rosewood cut. Amazingly flavorful. Needed nothing extra to add flavor. Had the Suckling Pig, which is probably my favorite... If there is any meat that you try here... It would have to be this one... There is no description that can really capture it so you just have to try it. You won't be disappointed. Also had the King crab legs - cooked to perfection.  This place is no where cheap or middle of the road. Go for the experience and the taste of the food. It was well worth both! We look forward to coming back again!",

What's so refreshing is the setting, ambiance and approach.  Most steak houses are white table cloth or they try to just look modern but just look unfinished.  What's going on here from when you enter the SLS through the main room to the restaurant is just a larger than life environment.    But how about the main character the food!  If you get the opportunity to have the $200 pp taste of everything... DO IT.  You won't be disappointed.  I can't even count how many rounds of taps, including oysters, cured meats, etc, etc. etc.  But the grand finally two huge steaks Rib-eye and tenderloin that just about melted in my mouth.

    "text": "What can I say except that Jose Andres is a genius. All of his restaurants offer a unique experience and by far has been one of the best dining experiences I have had. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with the aroma of the open fire grill where the meats are prepared. The decor is eclectic, whimsical but at the same time elegant.  Even the menu was beautiful made of black laquer decorated in a Baroque style. Just by the menu you knew you were in for a unique experience.  Most of the dishes are tapa style which are meant to be shared.  They also offer three different price fix menu started from $150pp to $250pp. Knowing that the dishes were on the small side we opted for the tasting menu. We really wanted to try his best dishes and knew this would be a good choice. We chose the second tier which was really way too much food, but we got to try a little of everything. The list is way to long and everything was exceptional so I will try and highlight our favorite dishes. Our first dish was the super giant pork skin chicharron. This is what I mean by unique. They place the chicharron on top of a piece of parchment paper and place it in the middle of the table and the waiter comes out with a mallet and starts breaking up the giant pork skin chicharron to pieces. Weird huh?  Don't be fooled this is no gimmick this is some serious tasting stuff. The next dish was the caviar flight. Each caviar and condiment was served in a beautiful glass sculpture which was stunning. Instead of serving alongside toast points it was served with puffed potato chips. The creme fraiche was served in a small tube representative of a painters tube. Very appropriate since the display was a work of art. These dishes were all very exciting, but the dish that took my breath away was the smoke and ice oysters and by this point I am suffering from sensory overload. I think there might have been smoke because of the ice used, but I can't recall. All I remember is an explosion of unusual yet delicious flavors, smokiness ,sweetness, and tart. The combination was phenomenal. The other dishes that are must haves are the croquetas which are served inside a paper cone and placed inside of a glass tennis shoe. This is a signature dish which he also serves at his other restaurant Jaleo. The next dish was the grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (Octopus) which was tender and grilled to perfection.  Now for the star of the show which is the steak. Amazing, but by this time we were stuffed. We were definitely way over our heads on this one. There were many more dishes and all were amazing. So a la carte or price fixed menu I don't think you could go wrong.  The restaurant is amazing and a bit pricey, but well worth every penny. It is definitely the ultimate dining experience.",

Thank you fellow Yelpers!!  I started with the foie gras cotton candy (delightful and whimsical). Then I had Robouchon mashed potatoes saturated in butter--divinely decadent!!  And lastly, I had 4 ounces of sliced Kobe ribeye that I got to cook at my table along with mustard greens (had no idea how much I like mustard greens!).  It was delicious.  I'm done with Kobe beef now, however.  It just seems overly fatty to me, personally. I chose 3 bite sized deserts that I no longer remember but were heavenly. It was a wonderful meal albeit $170 just for me without any alcohol.  I wanted to give it 4.5 stars but was stunted by Yelp's whole star system.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to dining here, but the overall experience fell flat. Maybe we didn't order the right dishes...? But if you're charging premium prices, then everything should taste great. That or perhaps the waitress could have suggested some other food items...?   Tableside Cocktail (don't have the exact description but it had lemon and grapefruit flavors) --- It was cool to see this made, but the cocktail was very small (even though she made a huge batch of extras, but didn't serve it) and it was very bitter from the grapefruit.   Lucia's Salad: Endive Caesar salad, Parmesan, anchovy, air croutons ($15) --- I can't believe this item is on the menu. This was their take on a \"Caesar salad\", but seriously... don't charge $15 for 6 little nothings! See photo!  Vittore 1950: Tenderloin of beef, black pepper, Parmesan cheese, capers, croutons, Sherry dressing ($24) --- This was fantastic, would highly recommend it. One of the best carpaccio I've ever had.  Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Crispy amaranth ($8 each) --- Really enjoyed this. You have to put the whole thing in your mouth at once... the fois gras piece just melts in your mouth.   Cauliflower Steak: Pine nuts, preserved lemon ($15) --- I love cauliflower, but this was probably the worst I've had other than eating it raw... Just tasted burnt... didn't taste the pine nuts or much of the lemon.  Brussels Sprouts Petals: Apricots, grapes, lemon air, lemon puree ($15) --- Tasted okay... wasn't particularly impressed and wasn't all that flavourful. Doesn't help that the portion size is small.  Washugyu/Angus (Lindsay Ranch, OR) ($98/lb) --- Ours was around 2.5 lbs? But when it came out there wasn't as much meat... probably mostly bone. The steak was a letdown... Considering it cost us over $200, this should have tasted like butter and super flavorful. It was tender, but lacked flavor overall. None of us were fighting to have the last few pieces, and we were left hungry...  Just to compare, we had a 24oz rib-eye steak at Sugarcane Raw Bar Grill @ The Venetian and THAT steak was A-MAZING, had more meat despite being less lbs and was also cheaper ($95 total with toppings and a side). So I'm not trying to be a steak snob by shooting this one down.  Dessert Cart (don't have prices) --- This looked beautiful when they brought it over. Had a praline pastry inspired by Pierre Herme, chocolate eclair, tart, tiramisu cream puffs (no photo). Overall they were good.  Overall Service = okay. Didn't provide much recommendations other than explaining how to order the steaks... which in the end wasn't great.  Overall Ambience = It's okay. I love looking at the steak counter, but didn't help the steak wasn't great.   Location = SLS Hotel... took an Uber to get here, so it's a bit of a trek up north along the Strip. The hotel is newer, but not very happening...",

    "text": "Already a fan of Jose Andreas I was not disappointed with Bazaar Meats. We chose to order several appetizers versus a full meal since we were at our he bar. We started with the olives (which I had at a DC location), they did not disappoint; the traditional olives paired with the molecular gastronomy version was a fun palate trip. It was the hubbies first time and he was over the moon about them. We also ordered the smoked oysters on a half shell. They came on a bed of ice with a nice foam, capped in a glass dome filled with luxurious smoke. Once opened the smoke permeated every sense and every square inch of the bar. At least 3 other people orders it based on the smell alone. The oysters had the taste of a beach side fire roasting with the tenderness and brineyness of a perfect raw oyster. In other words, heaven under a smoked glass. That was followed by the beef carpaccio lovingly wrapped around a crispy fennel bread stick accompanied by a Parmesan garlic aioli? Not quite sure if the dip as several drinks are in play by now. Whatever the dip was is was creamy, delicious and worthy of using your fresh get spatula to collect ever smear. The beef was perfectly done, tender and slightly smoky in flavor. We were happy to revisit the carpaccio in our final app which was the meat charcuterie board. We enjoyed a variety of meat, most notable (other than the carpaccio), an Iberico jamon and a sausage that tasted like Christmas. By now we were fullish sonthe hubby shared our meat board with the couple next to us, they also gave it a resounding thumbs up (may not be a 100% reliable opinion since they scored some tasters for free). Other than the high dollar price tag (which hitch is well earned), you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Where do I begin?    My family had never been to Vegas before this trip, and all I wanted to do was treat my family (and especially my father) to a meal they would never forget.  I researched about all the restaurants in Vegas for months before our trip.  Bazaar Meat was one of the few I finally narrowed down to.  What finally sold me was the fact that one of the managers, Chris Bugeya, and his guest relations team (Celina & Bree) patiently communicated back and forth with me via email.  They helped me create my own custom tasting menu for my family and accommodated a bunch of my \"special\" requests (e.g. making sure the customized menu wouldn't disclose prices, making sure my dad would receive a certificate for the kobe beef, etc.).  The night we went, I was met by Celina and she walked us to a \"private\" table which made our experience even better.  Chris was our server, and he was super attentive, friendly, and pleasant.  The food was spectacular.  The service was stellar.  I have nothing negative to say about this place.  Just know that you may be spending a good amount of money, but I am telling you that this experience was so worth it.  My family left the restaurant speechless, and my dad is never speechless.  Our experience as a family in Vegas for the first (and probably only time) will be a memory that will last more than a lifetime, and a large part of that would be due to this experience we had at Bazaar Meat.  I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to treat their loved ones to an experience they'll never forget.  Thank you, Bazaar Meat.  Outstanding all around.",

    "text": "Probably the best steak in my life. Not guaranteed in Vegas, where other values frequently trump the essence.  I was alone :-( and the maitre d offered a seat at the charcuterie bar as an option to a table for one. The bar is well laid out and I was gently embraced by the guys behind it in the experience and what they were doing.   Smart, knowledgeable, and happy (not a sure thing in a top line restaurant!) they made the movie of my exposure a pleasure.  The service was fabulous, with a waiter who mixed solid founded professionalism with just enough personal reach to help me get to where I wanted to be.  The steak (after an amazing Spanish charcuterie appetizer - vegans need not apply but then you get that) comes from a farm in Texas - I got the sense they could name the animal - was presented carved off the bone. My rare it was, and gorgeous in the presentation, but more so in the mouth.  Absolutely perfect in every respect. A side of mushrooms (why spoil the red fest with green?) and glasses of wine recommended by my server complimented every bite.  Breathtakingly expensive as well... But it is not infrequent that one finds expensive in Vegas... It is thus kind of quality of experience and substance that is rare.  Do it.",

My boyfriend and I had a bad day and we couldn't wait to just relax and enjoy each other and as we decided to give this venue a chance... let me tell you, the atmosphere alone was interesting; it's good different but inviting. You and can feel the Spanish influence in it! You will recognize the magnum wine on the side of your table and think, this is much needed. The moment we got greeted by our host to where we got seated, we both felt very welcome and comfortable. Our server, Miller was on point with informations and very efficient in his timing. Manager at the time, Pano greeted us a few times as well to make sure things were going fine and suggested a few starters for us that he loves.. well Pano, you're amazing and thank you for this experience we will definitely tell our family and friends about Bazaar Meat!!  The staff are all smiles and you just can't help but to smile back for starters, we got the cotton candy foie gras and croquetas de jamon And It Is To Die For!!!! You have to order it when you get there! Promise?  We got the ceviche as well and that is prepared on side table.. it's was very interesting to watch but the best part is eating it!! Our steak came out absolutely perfect  sides chosen were mushrooms and asparagus. This dinner was the on the top of our list and we highly suggest you come and try this place or you are missing out on something very special!!!  I've decided to come back here with family and friends in a few weeks for my birthday dinner and can't wait to show this venue off!!! thank you, to the staff for making this memorable for my boyfriend and I. The server and management were very professional, fast, efficient but most of all... it's the experience they made us feel!!! we will be back",

Even though there are so many small plates and options, everything looked, sounded, and smelled too good to stop eating! And I really appreciate the fact that there's a celiac friendly (gluten free) menu, and a dairy free menu. Each menu is HUGE and heavy and they handed me 2 of them to compare. So it was quite the juggling act. But there was plenty for me to eat. We tried the foix cotton candy, so unique and surprising. The brussel sprouts were light and refreshing, not heavy  or fried as is the trend everywhere else these days. The Asian tacos were pretty amazing. If those were passed appetizers at a party, I would have stalked the waiter for more. I tried the famous olives. Very interesting, but I wouldn't get them again. My friend had the Secreto Imberico (pork) which was out of this world, which them I got jealous and ordered the Waygu beef cheeks. Other reviews may say that it melted in your mouth, NO, THIS melted in your mouth. Unlike any beef I've ever had. They also have a dessert cart of many tiny bites, all beautiful, but we skipped it. No wine. Just the above, including tip, $165? All but the meats were small bites.    The place is stunning and it's a totally open kitchen. But you have to face it, otherwise you're looking at a wall. The staff was fantastic and very helpful. I'm thinking I will save up my calories and go back again at some point. I want to work my way through the menu.",

    "text": "When you walk into Bazaar Meats your senses are assaulted by the most wonderful grilled meat smell, which is then followed up by the sight of a spectacular meat coolers and grilling station.  This does set the expectations pretty high and they nail it.   The menu is varied, from unique appetizers, to fresh oysters and, of course, wonderful steak selections.  We did the 7 course menu, with added beef cheeks, which was a great way to experience touches of the entire menu.  We started with the olives, traditional and pureed, which was a nice light start to the night.  The pureed olives was unique but not as good is the traditional pepper stuffed olives. Next, was the cotton candy with foie gras which was an amazing bite - sweet and salty with a punch of umami. Following that were the Apple wood smoked, fresh oysters.  Great oysters, and the light smoke added a unique flavor.  Next was one of our favorite dishes - beef steak tomato lettuce wraps.  I would eat these daily!  Our next two courses came out at once - charcuterie plate and steak tartare with Parker House rolls.  On the charcuterie plate we had the best chorizo we ever tasted.  The tartare was an experience - it tasted like sloppy joes and was such an outstanding dish that is immediately went in our mental queue of top dishes.  Next, was out dry aged steak and braised beef cheeks.  My wife loved the beef cheeks, which had a wonderful flavor but more of a tight sausage texture.  The dry aged ribeye was the second best steak I have ever had - flavorful, tender, perfectly cooked with a wonderful (again with that word!) beefiness.  The cook made the steak as you could taste the grill flavor which makes a huge difference over a pan fried, more broiled, steak. The desert course was pretty standard as it didn't stand out but was good, and light, way to end the meal.  I initially was going to take a star off for the wine list, as that was the only thing that we thought was blatantly disconcerting about our experience.  The wine list was lazy, as they had nothing but what we consider, expensive and pretentious wines.  It's easy to put together an amazing looking wine list when, almost,  every bottle is well over $100 and most really well above that point.  A good sommelier better be able to put the work in and add some great wines in the $50-$100 bottle range - if they can not then find a better sommelier.    Overall, the experiences and food was outstanding, and minus the wine list, Bazaar is a place we would not hesitate to come back to.",

    "text": "I wouldn't know how the food is, but their service is not on par from what is expected (ie pathetic). Basically, our show, the Eddie Griffin Experience (literally right down the hall), ran till a few minutes after 10. By the time we got to the host it was 10:09. She said we were too late for our 10:00 seating. After a few mins of back-and-forth, she said there was a 10 minute grace period and I showed her my phone which said it was 10:11 (meaning we arrived within the grace period). She the explained that she didn't like the policy, either. She was stone cold stoic; no empathy whatsoever. Super annoying. I asked for the manager and she said 'it wouldn't matter' and left and came back without him. I asked for the manager AGAIN and she left and came back with him. Obviously, he was better experienced in dealing with upset customers and went to the back and came back and said we can order small plates. At this point, we had decided to leave because they ruined the mood. When telling the manager that they need to change their policy (you can't accept seating at 10 if you close at 10 and have a show that is in the same hotel and sometimes runs late, or if you want to allow seating at 10, call people in advance and clearly state the rules), the hostess (the same callous one from earlier) butts in and said 'maybe you should have been on time'. I looked at the manager and said 'I know you can't take care of that in front of a customer, but you need to explain to her how she's a really bad host when we walk away.'    I'm sure the meat would have been great (it's Jose, after all), but the service was the worst of the restaurants we went to in Vegas (and we've been to 6 of the top 10 by now). They either need to change their policy, or set better expectations. And definitely need to change out their host as she was unprofessional and rude.",

    "text": "Very few places have impressed me as much as Bizarre Meat.  The label of \"steakhouse\" is largely inadequate. Jose's is much more than that.  The menu brims with curiosity as most items have names that beckon you for a try. \"Cotton candy foie gras\"?.... Yes please!   I highly recommend the tasting menu for newcomers.  Each course exceeds, surprises, and delights. Bizarre Meat can be whimsical while  still honoring each item.  It never disrespects the main ingredient. Jose's creativity astounds on nearly every course.  You will be taken on a ride from a sublime slice of Iberico Jambon to the molecular gastronomy of a deconstructed olive suspended in liquid sphere form.   The decor at Jose's is also creative and fun. Gotta love the bulls head with wrestling mask that is on the wall.   The waitstaff is knowledgeable, attentive and friendly without being overbearing or too intrusive.   The wine list was modest but efficient. Jose's gin and tonic is a must. Finish with a fine port.   My sincere advice is to not hold back when ordering.  Bazaar Meat is a rare opportunity. You're in Vegas, go big or go home!",

    "text": "++Update below++ Originally 2 stars, but I changed to 4.  Jose, you messed up on this one. I've dined at Jaleo, my brother and I have dined at MiniBar in DC, and my brother studied under Jose in college. With expectations high, especially for my parent's 30th anniversary, we thought we made a safe bet. Unfortunately, we were mistaken. I also want to say we came really hungry on a Saturday night.  Food ====== The food was okay. The steak was good, but for similar priced amazing steak, I recommend CraftSteak in MGM - it is awesome. The portions are small, like tapas, so order a few items. The lox bagel roll was really salty.  Decor ====== The decor was trying a bit too hard. With all types of knickknacks, especially the cumbersome paper menus in heavy, rigid acrylic, ordering and navigating the menu was annoying.  Service ====== This was the worst part. I'm not sure if good waiters don't want to work on that side of the strip, but the guy we got was pretty bad. He loved to talk, and before he asked us about our food allergies or dietary restrictions, he went on a 3 minute tangent about the iberican hams. We don't eat pork. This guy also asked questions like \"should I take your water?\" after my mother's drink came, and had the nerve to try to upsell us some desserts in a box to go since he sensed our impatience after 2 hours on Saturday night. Eventually, my brother told the waiter not to ask any more questions and just leave us alone. Also, he mentioned the steaks take 45-55 minutes to prepare, so we wanted him to fire our order to the kitchen ASAP. Pacing wise, our 6-7 appetizers came out within 10 minutes and we were done in 30 minutes. The next 45 minutes we waited for the meats and sides we ordered with appetizers. My dad ended up getting pretty upset and left after waiting 1.5 hours past our seating time (before the steak came our) and ended up finishing dinner at the food court in our hotel. We got the rest of the food to go since our hunger subsided by then, and I ate cold (but still tasty) steak in my hotel room.  Update: ===== As you may see, Pano (the GM of Bazaar Meats) asked me to reach out. I did, and he followed up twice over the course of a week to get me on the phone. He was very apologetic and we spoke for 15 minutes about the experience and how he felt it was unacceptable that we received our entree 1.5 hours after our reservation time. He was very authentic and made sure it came across this was a very off night. He made it right to a point that I would go again and give it another chance. I can't hold a restaurant to the sins of one server, as the food was good.",

Located at the end of the strip, inside the SLS, I went here recently and ordered the following:  Smoke and ice oysters: they were different, and excellent. Great presentation with the wood smoke and sea foam.  Classic tartare: a large portion with plenty of flavor and great texture. Wagyu rib eye cut is amazing. A little on the salty side though.  Wagyu beef cheeks: probably the best and most tender meat I've ever had. Literally melts in your mouth. Soue vide made.  Rosewood rib eye: for a steakhouse, I expected this to be outstanding. But instead, it was underwhelming. While cooked properly to med rare, it was chewy, tough and a bit dry. The 2lb minimum order steak cost $150.",

The restaurant is beautiful, so many different things to look at, watching the food being prepared, of course people watching. For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating, maybe a bit too stuffy for such a fun restaurant. We both had a bourbon we had never tried while we perused the menu and made our choices.  We're both huge steak fans and the scent of charred steak permeated the air, so we agreed to share a Rib eye from Rosewood Texas, recommended by our server.  We shared the Classic Tartare to start, it was good but I've had better and I think I prefer it with toast as opposed to the soft rolls they served it with, it's that texture thing that would've helped. We eventually got our steak, oh baby! Again it was good, but I've had better, actually at a few places, if you have meat in your name, you better serve the best meat I've ever had!  We shared some sides of Catalan Spinach which I loved...the flavor combos were perfect! Then we couldn't pass up the Robuchon potatoes that are described as butter, butter, more butter and some potatoes. So smooth and creamy, the first few bites are extraordinary you don't want to stop eating them but then you feel that your mouth is just coated in butter and no matter what you eat, it can not be cleansed. Ick! I craved something like lemon sorbet but alas nothing even close to it on the menu, so we got Ten Little Pieces Dessert to share and take some home for later. They were tasty morsels, just nothing to rave about. We're kind of bummed at the bank roll we dropped here, just to be...\"Meh\". At least we got this place out of our system, on to the next \"I have to try\" place.",

Before we even ordered they gave us a run down on what and how to order. We ordered a near 2 LB wagyu angus beef steak and they explained how they cook it and how it was worth the wait and it was beyond what we could imagine in terms of taste and level of finish.

I just waited patiently.  Surprise, Surprise, they can seat us immediately.  AND the restaurant is only half full.

We were casually dressed, but we saw people way more casual than us when we got in. Anyway, our waiter was exceptional and our food was amazing, but the whole experience was kind of ruined by the hostess before we entered.

    "text": "I don't know if we went on an off night (I have read other reviews from the night we went that complained about the service as well).  But, to say I was underwhelmed with Bazaar Meat is an understatement.  When we walked in, I was blown away.  It's a dark and very chic looking place.  There is a small casino to your left as you walk in.  I can't believe other restaurants haven't thought of this, it's such a fantastic idea.  I've seen them in clubs, but not restaurants.  Waiting for your table, how about dropping a hundred at roulette?    The hostesses were very friendly and we were seated right away.  We had drink orders taken very quickly.  So far, so good.  This place is really an assault on the senses.  There are smells from the grilling, the music is loud, there are alligator heads on the wall, and employees everywhere.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see most of it from the seating area.  Our server started off friendly, and stayed friendly, but he also stayed away from our table.  This is one of the reasons I am giving 2 stars.  As the meal wore on, he was nowhere to be seen.  It took nearly a half hour to get our check.  Also, a table 2 tables from us remained unbussed for over 20 minutes.  I know you are crowded, it's a new hot restaurant on the Strip, but these are issues that shouldn't happened at a place of this caliber charging what they charge.  Most telling, two in my party ordered cocktails when we sat down.  The glasses remained on the table after they were completed, empty, for the entire 2.5 hour meal.  This would have been an easy fix, yet there they remained.  It became kind of a joke with us to see how long they would last.  Spoiler alert:  they were on the table when we left.  For all I know, they still are.  As other yelpers note, the menu is not your typical steakhouse.  It was described to us as a steakhouse meets a tapas place.  I would agree, this is a spot on description.  We started with the Iberico ham, the best ham in the world.  For $70 you don't even get 2 ounces (see my picture), but it's the best HAM IN THE WORLD.  I never regret buying this stuff, and it was no different at Bazaar Meat.  It is served with crustinis with tomato spread on them, sort of a Spanish bruschetta.  The whole thing is fantastic, highly recommended, but it ain't cheap folks.  We next went with the chicken croquettes.  You get 5-6 per order for $12, and they were fantastic.  Fried perfectly and lots of bechamel flavor.  Loved these things, I could have easily eaten another order.    A couple at our table ordered the famous foie gras cotton candy.  I didn't try it, they ate it so quickly.  I regretted getting one, but we had other things on our mind....  Like the steaks.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Lindsay Ranch ribeye, which of course I'd had my eye on since making the reservation.  As a result, we went with the Mishiwa Reserve, which is $65 a pound.  Supposedly, our steak weighed 2.5 pounds.  Now, I don't carry a scale with me to dinner, but there is no way this thing weighed 40 ounces.  But, we were hungry, and we ate it rather than complaining.  We did point it out to our server, but he said he had no way of knowing since we started eating.  He's absolutely right, but we still weren't happy with the size of this steak.  I don't know, maybe the bone weighs in at 22 ounces or something.  Also, this is the worst dry aged steak I've eaten.  It didn't have the depth of flavor you expect with dry aging.  Additionally, it wasn't adequately seasoned.  This was a fairly big error on such an expensive steak at a restaurant like this.  We ate the steak because we were hungry (and paid an arm and a leg for it), but we weren't happy.  We also tried the quarter of a suckling pig.  Now we're talking!  This thing was as advertised: juicy, flavorful, with that great crispy skin.  We got as much meat off of the thing as we could, but all of us could have used more.    For sides, we went with the Delmonico potatoes, asparagus, and carrots.  All were good, the potatoes were almost too decadent (if such a state exists).  The asparagus is small, but it was cooked well.  I could have used more flavor from the romesco sauce.  The carrots with pepper and Greek yogurt was probably the table favorite.  I'd absolutely get this dish again.  We were given a small plate of desserts gratis at the end of our meal.  They, like the rest of the meal, were hit and miss.  Overall, I'd say this is an ambitious and unique addition to the fine dining scene in Las Vegas.  I don't know if we went on a bad night (as noted above, I've seen at least one other review that dined the night we did, November 15, 2014, that complained about the service).  I also know restaurants grow and even the best places have issues.  But, for what we paid, a lot of the things are close to inexcusable.  I'd return, but not for a long time, and I will definitely bring a scale....",

It is served tapas style so your guests can enjoy a little bit of everything. I would have given it 5 stars however the management staff seemed to walk to every table asking how they are doing but ours. I kinda felt we weren't important enough to visit. Our waiter Chris was fabulous. Knows his food and knows his wine! Answered questions and made sure our experience was the best one! We even got the chance to see the rancher that supplies their beef. Of course he didn't come to our table either lol. No biggie though, the food is still amazing!",

It's inside the SLS hotel, so a bit of 10 minutes cab drive off the strip. It's worth the drive! I guarantee it!         Dinners include everything about meats and a whole lot more from Mediterranean mussels to sea urchin, seared quail, farm chicken and oxtail. For dessert, enjoy delights like dark chocolate lollipops, bonbons, ice creams and sorbets.        Bazzar Meat by Jose Andres also features a creative cocktail selection with the well-known Bar Manager Hien Truong (former opening Hakkasan Las Vegas, Rose. Rabbit. Lie), with drinks like the Smoke on the Water, made with blackberries, atomized scotch, islay mist and flame and many cocktails are served table-side to show you a spectacular show of craftsmanship, only for those who truly appreciate it.         Bazaar Meat is designed by the famous architecture/designer Philippe Starck (Mondrian, Paramount, Hudson hotels in NYC, LA, Chicago, and Delano Miami South Beach) and features two private dining rooms. The restaurant is spacious, probably 1 of the bigger restaurant that I've seen in Las Vegas, beautifully designed, warm, inviting, and quite intimate with the open kitchen, open flame grill when you first walk it.         I also love the communal table can hold up to 30 people, I got to sit there ;-) This can hold up your BDAY or a bachelorette party! Great idea for group dinner at the upcoming CES 2015.        While chef Jose Andres bears the name, Chef De Cuisine David Thomas is the man in charge the kitchen and GM Yassine Lyoubi offers an impeccable service from the moment we arrived till we left.   The food:  - Jose's Asian Taco - Jamon iberico de bellota, toasted nori, flying fish roe - who would have thought, they go so well together?  - Cotton Candy Foie Gras Crispy amaranth - a MUST TRY  - Sea Urchin - Soy, wasabi, pickled ginger, lemon  - Bagels & Lox Cone - Dill cream cheese, salmon roe  - Jamon Iberico de Bellota* (Fermin, Salamanca, Spain) Hand-cut from the famous black-footed Spanish pig, acorn-fed, free-range  - Wagyu Beef Cheeks Mojo rojo, oranges  - Grilled Baby Corn Mayonnaise, chile piquin, popcorn powder  - Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega Galician style octopus, potato, pimenton  - Wagyu steak by 3 OZ minium order, prepared to perfection   - The sausage for days....       Everything was delicious, out of this world with an impressive creation of many dishes that I've never seen before. So if you come here, please leave your 'narrow-minded' and 'traditional steakhouse mind' at home. It's Vegas, so go wild baby! You are surely in for a real treat!       I can't wait to bring my parents back here soon! This is probably 1 of the most exciting restaurants recently opening in Las Vegas in 2014.",

You just know that dinner experience will be awesome when you are greeted by an enthusiastic server.   Our awesome waiter, Chris kindly walked us  through the menu and we decided on the NYE prefix menu with A La cart.   Bazaar has more or less traditional signature dish of jose with speciality on meat.   Chef's selected cured meat was delicious but little too much for two people. ( Definitely suggested with group of 4+)   I had to go for the cotton candy foie gras granted its banned in California for a good reason. I felt like a terrible human being trying it but decided not to think about it... #FOMO #YOLO.  The prefix meal was pretty incredible. I suggest the restaurant to reduce the serving portion and dropping the price a little to make it more available to wider audience. Vegas is really foodie heaven, especially to those who don't drink like myself.  We had the honor to try out their A8 Japanese Wagyu Kobe beef. It literally melts in your mouth and is worth every bite.   There's less ridiculous props involved in this particular restaurant, but enough to make the experience triply bazaar and unique. It's worth deviating little further from the strip for the experience.",

    "text": "I overall enjoyed myself at Bazaar Meat and am happy that I had an opportunity to visit. The restaurant's ambiance is beautiful and unique, with crazy sculptures and busts of various animals as well as a chic vibe. I had a drink at the bar (I cannot remember the name, but it had the word \"bubbles\" in it). Regardless, it smells like truffles and has a truffle aftertaste, but was overall different and tasty. The bartender also came up with a unique cocktail concoction for my friends, made with Mezical and jalepeno.  So of course, you should know first off that this is not going to be a budget friendly meal. The portions are small (tapas style), unless you get one of the big meats, which are extremely expensive. Regardless, we still had a very pleasant meal for 5 without breaking the bank ($280 + tip). I would probably eat a little something first, though.  The standout for me was the lamb, served with fried oysters and potatoes. The lamb was rich and extremely tender, the oysters were buttery, delicious, and fried perfectly, without too much breading. While the portion wasn't huge, it was actually big enough to stand as an entree on its own. We also tried two of the potato dishes, and the Delmonico was indeed the winner- cheesy potatoes win every time!  Even the chicken croquets were yummy, served in a whimsical \"shoe\", they had lots of flavor, and again were not over breaded or fried.  Our server started off as \"typical fine dining server\", but by the end, we transformed him into hilarious hipster server with a bit of a potty mouth- we loved it!  I was a little disappointed that we mentioned that it was my birthday, wondering if they could do anything for it. They brought a rich dark chocolate mousse dish with a gold flake, birthday candle, etc... and it was on the bill! Uh... yeah, might want to give a heads up on that one- if that was going to be the case, I would have chosen my own birthday dessert!  All in all, it was a good experience, and I would like to get the suckling pig next time- on someone else's dime!",

There was a huge gap between one dish to the next and I think this is due to everything being in different kitchens so it seems like they don't talk to each other. It took about an hour to get our steaks and by that time we were starving.  The waiter seemed like he was standing around a lot. Actually a lot of them seemed to be standing around the center table for a while and no one picked up our plates for about 30 minutes even though most of us had finished and was just sitting there.   Overall I will never return here.  I expected a lot more from an establishment of this caliber.  Get it together Bazaar.",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Bazaar Meat. stop two on our restaurant week tour of Vegas. #helpoutdineout. We were meeting friends for this one on a Monday night so was hoping for a quiet meal. Place was very busy with several multi party tables. We met our friends who arrived first and were brought to the table and drink orders taken Immediately. I ordered a beer that I do not see often on menus, Weihenstephaner. Basically a Hefenweizzen.  I need to start over a bit, this is our first time here so let me begin with the entry to this fine place. Bazaar is located in the rear of the casino and as you enter you are greeted by this incredible smokey smell of the charcoal wood being burned, On my left was a meat counter with active hot open grills being used to sear and cook various cuts of gorgeous meat, some up to 4 inches thick. after that was a Charcuterie area and in the middle to our right a wine/beverage station. As we approach our table to the left is a seafood habitat I will call it. A separate dining area where on display are various fish and seafood selections.  As we are here for a special menu that is affordable and helps local charity, we peruse that menu and are given by the waiter, a description of the various choices. As it so happens they are out of the skirt steak so a bone in rib-eye is substituted. Not the 4 inch tomahawk. (damn).  This is a tasting menu so it is not a choice of, it is brought out in courses for all to enjoy. Starters, Cotton Candy Foie Gras. Josie did not eat these so I had 2. gastronomy stuff is not impressive to me so this was not a big wow factor for me. Basically cotton candy on a stick with a very small bite of Foie Gras. Not a big fan and hard to describe. It was just okay to me. next was Croquettas De Pollo, Chicken Fritters. These were nice fritters with some chicken and Bechamel sauce. A mother sauce used in a different way. Served in a clear plastic tennis sneaker. next was a tomato Gezpacho. The rest of the table was enjoying this but the tomato cucumber coldness on my palet didn't sit quite right. Clams leche le tigre. I am a fan has a foam on top and a slight spicy bite. I was able to have two since Josie was not partaking in this delicacy. Finally a Spanish Pork sausage with honey alioli. Nice crisp skinned pork sausage, no particular deep flavor. Somewhat bland for my taste.  Next course was the steak course and since the skirt steak was not an option two bone in rib-eye steaks cooked mid rare (rare actually) were brought out. Serbed with buttered, buttered, buttered creamy potatoes. These taters had just the right saltiness as well as buttered flavor. Also served with button mushrooms that had a smokey taste to them. An excellent accompaniment to the steak.  So, this is where I may be prosecuted a bit. As well as they present everything and the cooking process on display in the front of the restaurant, I was not impressed with the steak. I know they are heralded for their incredible meat, but this cut and flavor was not impressive. Maybe I have become accustomed to a more seasoned steak. While I did enjoy the tenderness of the steak and the sweet smokey flavor from the hardwood grill, I was hoping maybe for a more seasoned steak. With all the wow factor things going on in here and the different flavor profiles of each dish, I was thinking there would be a special zest or spice beyond the smokiness of the char grill. I suppose the hype not worth the reveal.  Desert round was assorted small cakes, tarts and cream puffs.  Thank you for dining at Bazaar Meat. I may go back here again, but truthfully not within my everyday budget. I guess for me the experience wasn't worth my everyday man budget. It was nice to have a meal with good friends and support a local charity. If you like a good steak and seafood and have a budget for a more pricey meal then check this out. Or, if you happen to catch the next restaurant week, this would be a great option",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday this year and was excited to try Spanish-culinary king Jose Andres' creations.  We came on a Friday night, but must've gotten there early, since the place only started to fill up as we were finishing up with the meal.  The dining room is definitely hunting lodge meets gourmet restaurant. There's no pretentiousness at Bazaar, and even though you're getting the 5-star treatment, the waitstaff isn't at all stuffy. They have just the right amount of attentiveness, complete thorough knowledge and understanding of the menu, and even a touch of humor.   I was sure to study the menu in-depth after making the reservation, but our waiter was trained well and was sure to explain how it works anyway. Other than the main meat dishes, every dish is tapas-style, featuring perfect-sized tasting portions so you get to try a selection of what Bazaar offers, without being too overwhelmed.   We ordered the: gazpacho shots, which reminded me of a slightly too salty liquid salad (a good thing, minus the salty part); croquetas de pollo, which were 'sold' to us as fried balls of chicken pot pie. Sadly, they were seriously lacking in seasoning and my fellow diner found chicken cartilage in hers ... needless to say, that ruined the experience. The waiter did take it and show it to the chef, but she did nothing about it on our end and we did still pay for it on the final bill; that was a bit disappointing.  My dining companion was excited to try the sloppy joe mini sandwich, but it was really nothing special and the ratio of meat to bread was way off (too much of the latter).   The thing I was really excited about was the wagyu beef cheeks ... and then I was disappointed by it in the end. I was expecting a melt-in-your-mouth experience, but found that not to be the case. It required a knife to cut through, but while the meat itself was less-than-stellar, the accompanying mojo rojo sauce and mandarin slices were divine and helped bump it up a bit.  My fellow diner ordered the veal chop, which was cooked well. The mojo verde sauce was pretty much a chimichurri, but very doable.   One thing we made sure to get was the Joel Robuchon potatoes - er, butter with potatoes. Those were very creamy and made to perfection, although - and apologies to Chef Robuchon on this - I don't think it needs so much butter.   The brussels sprout petals were lovely. The addition of lemon air to the vegetable really sexified it up, I just wish the whole thing was served a bit warmer.   Certainly the star of the dinner was - perhaps  oddly enough - the baby carrots. They're heirloom/colored carrots served whole with a side of greek yogurt, and I can undoubtedly say they were extremely scrumptious. So, of all the things one can get at Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres, yes, the carrots provide a good enough reason to possibly return. And the waitstaff. But that may be just about it.",

    "text": "After dining at Jose Andres' most excellent minibar in DC, I was excited to sample one of his restaurants in Vegas in our recent visit. E is supposed to be exquisite but we were unable to land a reservation so we opted for the new, trendy Bazaar Meat instead.  I'll cut to the chase: stick w/the appetizers and forego entrees. Of what we got (in order of preference):  - Chicken coquette (out of a plastic shoe), grassini (beef carpaccio w/onion seasoning wrapped around a bread sticked w/parmesan dip) and chefs choice charcuterie were rather yummy and enjoyable.  - Beef cheeks was nice and tender but nothing to write home about. - Foieffle was ok. Peanut butter was a bit overpowering. - The giant chicharron felt a bit gimmicky and a bit much for the two of us after a few days of nonstop gorging in Vegas. - The $100-Wagyu rib eye was utter disappointment. It's supposed to be the tastiest cut but we found it bland and had to ask for salt to make it bearable. We didn't finish this dish.   Overall Bazaar Meat isn't a place we'd make it a point to visit again. But if we happen to be in the area and looking to grab a small bite, we'd stop by for a charcuterie plate and grassini.",

    "text": "This review was so hard to write because it is very difficult to put this type of dining perfection into words.  I will say that this restaurant has not only earned a 5 star review, but it has become the standard that I measure other possible 5 star restaurants against.  Yes. It was that good.    First of all, this restaurant is stunningly beautiful. The place boasts four separate kitchens which take the \"Open Kitchen\" concept and put it on steroids.  The largest of the four kitchens, the meat kitchen, is in the center of the restaurant and offers 360 degree views of the meat being cooked.  The contraptions (seriously, I can't think of a better word to describe it) where the meats are being cooked are one of a kind and can be described as works of mechanical art.  The bar is beautiful and the hand crafted cocktails all look delicious.  I tried the cotton candy mojito (which is actually served up in a martini glass) and it was so good.  Perfect combination of sweet and tart!   The food is second to none in this tapas/small plates style restaurant. I went with my husband and another couple. Here is what we ordered:   Cotton Candy Foie Gras Lucia Salad Bison Buffalo Style Carpaccio Beef & Parmesan Grissini Carpaccio Yellowfin Tuna Carpaccio Salmon Tartar Suckling Pig Sandwich Harris Ranch Black Angus Baby Carrots Grilled Asparagus  The Lucia Salad are individual endive leaves filled with dressed parmesan and a small sliver of anchovy. This starter is super tasty and the anchovy is definitely the star here.    The carpaccios were absolutely outstanding.  I even liked the Bison which I normally do not care for.  The combination of blue cheese and pickle flavor combined with the Bison is both unique and excellent. The Yellowfin Tuna was the best that I have ever had.  My favorite, the Beef & Parmesan Grissini, was beef wrapped around grissini and served with a parmesan dip.   I don't eat pork or foie gras but everyone at our table who tried the Cotton Candy Foie Gras and the Suckling Pig Sandwich said that they were both delicious.  My girlfriend said the pig was delicious but a touch on the rich side. Instead of these, I ordered the Salmon Tartar and I loved it.  The combination of the salmon and creamy avocado in this dish is so good, I hated to share it.     At this place you order your main dish first as the steaks can take up to an hour to prepare, as well as your sides.  Then you order several small plates to taste while you wait.  Our main dish was the Harris Ranch Black Angus Steak and the sides we chose were Baby Carrots and Grilled Asparagus.  Because of all of the small plates that we ordered, my party of four split one order of the Steak and one order of the sides.  The steak was perfectly seasoned and exceptionally well cooked.  I was pretty stuffed by the time it came to the table but make room for it I did :)   I'll admit that I really don't remember much about the service. The food here just kind of overshadowed everything else about the place.  It must have been flawless as the food, and the drinks, seemed to be flowing. Speaking of the drinks, my husband really enjoyed the sommelier.  He said he was very knowledgeable and down to earth.    Based on the reviews, I was expecting this place to be much pricier than it was.  The four of us ate for under $600 and that included a bottle of red. Definitely would not call it inexpensive, but I have happily paid more for a meal of this caliber. I would absolutely recommend this spot and I can not wait to go back!",

    "text": "While other restaurants market themselves as being different, Bazaar Meat delivers the goods. With a massive menu -- physically heavier than most and with more variety of items than other steakhouses -- this place really is unique. As soon as I learned their opening date I snagged reservations for our party of four. I'm typically weary of new restaurants, but as a fan of Jose Andres I had to give it a shot.  From beginning to end our meal was outstanding. To start, a dozen oysters ($34) -- six medium sized, briny and meaty Paradise oysters and six small, more mild Kusshi oysters. There are four types of tartares on the menu. The classic ($24) is prepared tableside and served with parker house rolls. Don't be afraid to make yourself a steak tartare slider, I did and it was fantastic.  The list of starters is where Andres' influence is most evident with items like cotton candy foie gras, tacos, chicharron, and croquetas. The dish that jumped out at me, though, was the s'mores ($30). Four to an order. Each with wafer thin graham crackers sandwiching slivers of chocolate, velvety smooth and rich foie, and torched and blistered hunks of marshmallow. Try to stay composed after eating one. It's impossible. They're so good you'll be banging the table or letting some expletives fly out of shear amazement. They are sweet, so next time I might consider getting them as a dessert.  Side dishes are delicious as well. Andres takes a playful jab at Joel Robuchon's pomme puree with his own rendition of mashed potatoes ($15) with a menu description that reads, \"butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes.\" On the lighter side are the Brussels sprouts petals ($12), served with grapes, apricots, lemon air, and lemon puree. My favorite side was the baby corn ($13). Grilled and topped with mayo, chile piquin, and popcorn powder it's the perfect combo of heat and sweetness.  Our group shared the Spanish-style bone-in rib eye ($80/lb) from Washugyu Ranch, Oregon. It's cooked on their Josper grill (part oven, part grill. Google it. I had to and it looks cool.) using charcoal and grape leaves, giving it plenty of smokiness. It isn't cheap at $80 a pound. Our steak came in at 3.13 pounds, which equals an empty wallet at the end of the night. But, it's one of the best I've had in town.   Desserts are on the small side. They're about the size of single serving buffet desserts.  We ordered ten ($25) consisting of five different types served in a cute bakery-style box. The order: dark chocolate and olive oil cream puff; dark chocolate and aged rum cake; caramelized puff pastry with bacon, strawberries and cream; milk chocolate peanut, and caramel tart; and caramelized puff pastry with chocolate, caramel and sea salt. All were great, particularly the dark chocolate cake and the bacon and strawberry puff pastry.  Service was exceptional all night. Our server (formerly of L'Atelier) and busser offered great recommendations and checked in frequently to make sure all of our needs were met. The only negative is that their dessert menu didn't list all ingredients for the dishes. My friend, who has a nut allergy, reacted to hazelnuts in the dark chocolate and aged rum cake forcing her to rush home after dinner for allergy medicine. Luckily, she was fine and we had a fantastic meal. Bazaar Meat might be the new kid on the block, but in my book they're already one of the top three steak houses in Vegas.",

    "text": "This is the fourth location I try (Bazaar SOBE, Bazaar Mar, and SAAM at The Bazaar). I've yet to try a Jose Andres restaurant I haven't liked!   Just like most of his other Bazaars, every decorative item mixes with the most unlikely textures and finishes to create a whimsical space. Located at the SLS, I arrived on time for a late Friday  10 pm dinner. It surprised me to find the crowd thinning out. What's going on, Vegas? Can't hang like Miamians? Our SOBE spot is full until the very last second. Odd. The vibe felt a lot more laid back too. Not a bad thing, just an observation.   Although I'm familiar with the Bazaar format, the large and heavy menu still overwhelmed me. I will need many more visits to get through this one.   WHAT I TRIED:  BAGELS & LOX CONE FOIEFFLE CROQUETAS DE JAMON SKIRT STEAK/AMERICAN WAGYU SECRETO IBERICO DE BELLOTA BUTTERED POTATO PUREE ASSORTED DESSERTS  HITS: The Foieffle with honey, peanut butter, and foie espuma. Oh lord! I will order that as often as I can and never tire of it. I can't stop thinking about the Buttered Potato Puree. As described on the menu, the puree is \"butter, butter, more butter, and some potatoes.\" Perfect.   BEST IN SHOW: Not surprisingly, the impressive Secreto steak always delivers. Order that anytime you see it on a Bazaar menu. Excellent taste and quality.  I've had the cone and croquetas before and I can't visit without them, so those were par for the course.   MISS: Going in, I expected to be blown away by any meat ordered. The skirt steak was good, but nothing I can't get back at home (especially at any Argentinian restaurant). Perhaps we kept it too safe? Will hold on any further critique until I can return and order a whale of a cut.   BIG MISS: No dessert cart for me. I know I dined late. By the time I was ready to order dessert, the cart had been emptied and rolled away. I missed it by maybe 10 minutes which leads me to think surely they could have held off closing it up until the last table ordered and experienced it? 1. I'm a huge dessert lover. I rather have dessert than an entree. 2. It's part of the magical Bazaar experience! Maybe even a little on the silly side, but I'm like a five year old when it comes to sweets. Instead, our waiter presented a simple tray with the dessert options. Ho-hum. Boring. Boo. BUT, all the ones I tried were at least truly spectacular.   Service rocked. I loved our waiter. He made the night additionally fun with his insight and witty personality.   Despite the over-the-top dining options in Las Vegas, I would go out of my way to return. Clearly, I'm a huge Jose-Andres fan. I must further explore that menu. Until next time...",

    "text": "Bazaar Meats by Jose Andres had long been on the wife's and my list of places to eat in Las Vegas.  However, we figured that we better go now given the SLS' constant state of flux and the seeming imminent closure of all of its restaurants with the recent ownership change.  We had early reservations (5:45PM) on Thursday.  Unfortunately, we got stuck in traffic around the Sands Convention Center coming from our hotel perhaps that made what we thought was going to be a short trip into an almost 45-minute slog.  I called the restaurant to let them know we were caught in traffic and would be late arriving.  They understood and graciously informed us that our table would be waiting.  Upon arriving, we were immediately led through the restaurant's sprawling dining room back to a more intimate space shared by the fresh seafood raw bar/prep area.  Our affable lead server, informed us that it was one of five separate kitchens in the restaurant, which we found interesting.  We knew before going in from its website that Bazaar Meat offered a couple of tasting menus; however, there was a third tasting menu that we weren't aware of that offered certified A-5 Satsuma Wagyu grilled tableside over a hot stone and Jamon Iberico de Bellota.  It was way over the top, but hey, we're in Vegas, so we audibled to it.  I ordered a Smoked Aladdin Manhattan ($18) a bourbon Manhattan made with Buffalo Trace but smoked with wood chips (cherry?) and poured out of the smoking bottle to enjoy while we waited for the parade of food to arrive.  It was a nice presentation easily matched by the satisfaction I received from the balanced, boozy, and smoky...but not overpowered by it...drink.  Our food began arriving at our table.  We received 12 courses with three sides and desserts.  Rather than giving a course-by-course description, I'll let my pictures do the talking.  It was adventurous, extravagant, a treat for all of the senses to include hearing the beautiful sizzle of A-5 wagyu on a hot rock.  However, as good as it was, it wasn't a flawless dining experience.  While the Morcilla with Uni was made with ingredients I love and was (still) delicious, it was also the lone conceptual miss as the blood sausage overpowered the delicate, subtle flavors of the exceedingly fresh uni.  Service was also a bit chaotic.  Despite our server's best efforts to choreograph our service experience, on more than one occasion food runners delivered food coming from one of the restaurant's five separate kitchens/prep areas out of the expected sequence, which resulted in confusion for us and our server.  In fact, we didn't get one of the courses on the menu.  However, to our server's credit, we got a generous portion of Jamon Iberico de Bellota to replace the missed item.  Finally, the wife and I each ordered a glass of red wine to accompany our wagyu beef.  The wife received hers, but it took the sommelier a noticeable amount of time to make it over to pour my glass.  While I appreciated the sommelier coming over to describe the wine she was pouring, it may have made sense to have more people trained/knowledgeable on the wines available by the glass and able to pour it using a Coravin especially given the sheer size of the restaurant, which was quite busy with several very large parties seated around the dining room.  These critiques, especially given the prices that we paid for the food and drink, were what kept me from being able to call Bazaar Meat a 5-star experience.  Still, these comparatively small faults were far outweighed by the strong positives like the amazing array of food and drink that we received.  Without a doubt, Bazaar Meat is a destination dining spot.  I'd definitely dine here again.  It will be a shame if the city loses this one-of-a-kind restaurant as a part of the SLS ownership change.  If you have the dime, Bazaar Meat is definitely worthy of your time if you're looking for the over-the-top, only in Vegas kind of meal.",

    "text": "My dinner experience at Bazaar Meat is officially the second best meal I've ever had in Las Vegas.   I had a feeling I was going to go for the tasting menu, and after being handed a very large menu and glancing at the  first section I didn't feel the need to hold up the heavy menu any longer to look further. There was no way I was going to be able to make any sort of decision with so many options that sounded outstanding.  The first course already had me changing my mind about ever trying foie gras. All it took for me to sellout was some cotton candy! Apparently, I'll eat anything if you put some cotton candy around it, but it wasn't the cotton candy that impressed me, that foie gras was delicious! I was ready to go stand in the corner of shame after that foie gras experience, but before I could get up the croquettes and olive course arrived and I was super curious about the \"liquid olive\" which was quite fascinating. I wanted to touch it and poke it, but I behaved myself. The croquette was one of my favorite items of the night!  The next tapa that joined us was a basket of chicharones with a side of yogurt and zaatar. I grew up eating lebneh and zaatar sandwiches so I wished they had been a bit more generous with the zaatar, but I know it's a strong flavor for most.  The next guest that showed up to our dinner party was a butcher block of Jamon. Thing went a bit south here when a male employee in a suit approached our table to check on us and then proceeded to MANSPLAIN to our table what Jamon is. I guess he assumed there was no way our table of 4 women in our 30's had been to Spain or eaten Jamon before (eyeroll).  The flavor packed air bread pastrami sandwich which I loved & the tableside prepared beef tartar with mini slider buns arrived next. The main course was a perfect dry aged rib eye accompanied by the best potato flavored whipped potato pure I've had in my life and a citrusy Brussel sprout salad. The meal concluded with a dessert sampler platter. I kind of wished we would have gotten the experience of the dessert cart visiting us to make our own choices, but then again, we wouldn't have picked such a diverse array of items and that was the whole point of  the tasting menu so in the end it all worked out.   Overall this place was great. I loved the look and feel of the dinning room and the service we received from everyone, minus the condescending man in the suit, was professional and awesome.",

    "text": "[occasion] -  Visiting LV for the summer and had a nice weekend dinner date with the dearest.   [Space | Looks] - The restaurant is inside the SLS and towards the back-end of the building and you'll notice cause it get's exponentially darker as you go deeper in. The interior is classy and trendy, super roomy and again, dark.    [Service] - Great service. Couldn't have asked for anything different.   [Food | Drinks] - JOSE ANDRES, you've done it again. This is about the 4th or 5th Jose Andres restaurant I've dined with and honestly, I plan to just walk in with full confidence and order with my eyes closed in the next restaurant of his I experience.   FOOD  //  [+] Appetizer: Foie Gras Cotton Candy. It's a one-biter and within the ball of sugar yarn, you get a taste of foie gras and the two flavors together are the perfect balance of airy sweetness and rich buttery-ness from the goose liver.  [+] Appetizer: Ginger Uni with Lemon Soy Air. SO FRESH and just overall so good. And yes, initial thought is \"i'm eating air\", but just think of soy foam with heavy citrus flavor. Somehow that pairs so well with the saltiness of the uni and ginger bits.  [+] Grilled Lobster with Melted Butter: HANDS DOWN, best lobster I've ever eaten. Nothing more to say than if you love your lobster, this is what you should get.  [+] 12 ounce Spanish Dry-Aged Steak: Boyfriend loved it and said it was the best steak he's ever tried, so clearly we're very over-impressed here, lol.   [Recommendations] - Lobster, I saiiid.   [FINAL THOUGHTS] - I live in the DMV so I am blessed with a fair number of J.A. and ThinkFood restaurants, but life would be just dandy if they opened a Bazaar Meats where I am :)",

    "text": "After waiting 7.5 months to finally get to try Bazaar Meat I was worried that my expectations would be too high and feared disappointment.   To be honest, it was not perfection, but that was because of one dish which was fresh oysters. I cannot really remove a star for something they don't season/prepare beyond a shuck.   We had the Super Giant Pork Skin Chicharron to start. Sure the name implies it is going to be huge, but at a sharing style restaurant the portions are never massive, so we reigned in expectations. And then this cart starts heading toward us and we were wondering what we ordered that would need to be transported that way. It was as the name says - Super Giant. But so light and delicious. And the Greek Yogurt with za'-atar was moreish. We couldn't get enough.   Next came the oysters. They were missing the briney flavour of the sea. Not offensive in any way, but just there.   The Chef's Selection of Cured Meats followed and delivered all of the flavour the last course was missing. From the boar sausage to the chorizo to the mole sausage, the mortadella, the blood sausage, and the Jamon Iberico. It was FANTASTIC.   For the mains we had a Denver Steak that we ordered medium (because of me. My friend enjoys it less done) and it came medium rare at most. The middle was totally rare. I ate the ends and she ate the middle and it was the most delicious steak we had ever eaten. Even the mushrooms accompanying were bursting with flavour.  With a side of asparagus we were too full for dessert, but didn't need it because the meat was what we came for and it was everything we had dreamt of.   We will absolutely return!",

I tried the 'Don't be a Lemon' and it was pretty impressive. They used liquid nitrogen, and it became somewhat of an adult sorbet due to the alcohol. Would recommend that one for sure next time.   Although it was a Saturday night, it was not super packed, we asked the hostess if it was possible to be seated sooner and she was very accommodating.   We got seated, and there were several waiters who tended to us from time to time. We went with 'Jose's Way' the tasting menu. Our party did have 1 member who was pregnant and the kitchen was able to adjust the menu accordingly so she may eat as well.   Overall we had a great time, the food was amazing and at times adventurous. The service was on point, checking in throughout the evening, and reassuring when next items were to arrive. I would love to come back with my parents and treat them to this meal sometime.",

I would give them a 1* based on how overpriced it is.  $225 for a large texas ribeye? $640 for a suckling pig?   I'm from Texas.  You'd be hard pressed to find a ribeye of similar size that was Prime and dry aged for a month that breaks $125.    I went with a big group.  We ordered oysters, steak, carpaccio trays, carrots, potatoes, and a couple of drinks.  The food is good.  My favorite was the ribeye and outclassed everything else except maybe the charred carrots which I thought were delicious.  I've had better roasted pigs and thought the skin was almost inedible.  It was fairly oily and boney, but that's usually expected. The service was decent: a little slow to get drinks out.    I think you have to know that you will absolutely overpay for the food.  It's good.  I've had better.  I've had better in Vegas even: Mesa Grill, Nora's, Spago, Public House...",

While prices were always high, quality of meats was on a high end, but not any more.  SUckling pig 1/4 portion was tiny 8-12 oz, which is certainly not worth anywhere near $160 (I just came back from Spain, and the same size portion was under $15 at every restaurant, so $160 price is beyond unreasonable to half pound of pork).  The very same 20 Oz steak which was extremely high quality on prior visits, was very chewy this time around, and you could get much better quality meats at many competing quality steakhouses in Las Vegas for about $60-$80, not at $140.  Thair Waguy Ribeye steak was anything but Waguy.  Instead of marblem meat, you got a regular Ribeye surrounded by huge amount of fat on its outer edge at a cost of $160.  They really do not seem to care if you come back or not, given above, and I will not return.  This place is a one visit type of a restaurant, hence a tourist tap by definition.",

I started off the meal with some Iberico Ham which was insanely tasty.  The waiter said it was the last thing he wanted to taste before he dies.  I can see why!  We then had Jose's tacos which were comprised of fish eggs and Iberico ham.  Good stuff!  Next up was the pork skin chicharron which was tasty and they gave me a hammer to smash it into pieces.  Definitely felt like Thor for a moment.  I decided next to try the wild boar sausage which was an excellent decision because it tasted amazing and wasn't gamey to me although I love rich wild game tastes.    After this I decided to go all out and get the Japanese A5 Wagyu Kobe Beef which comes with a certificate.  They cooked it tableside on a Japanese hot stone which was awesome.  It had  an intense rich flavor and I just held each piece on my tongue savoring it.  Absolutely incredible!   For the main event I asked what the best overall steak with the richest flavor was and the waiter recommended the bone in Washugyu ribeye which is what I ordered.  It was absolutely beautiful on the table.  I enjoyed every bite of it!  Needless to say I had my largest ever food tab (it beat out Picasso which i ate at this trip as well), but it was definitely worth it!  Great experience!    I want to go back next time I'm in town and get the suckling pig!",

I Honestly would have tried more of the meat had it not been so expensive. I understand you're paying for high quality, just not sure $200 steaks are worth it. However, our waitress was lovely, made us feel comfortable. The croquettes were to die for. The best coffee ice cream I will ever have. In fact, if it wasn't for the fact that I read on Yelp how several people who didn't order a whole lot claimed to have gotten mistreated by their waiter, I would go back just for the croquetes and a drink and that coffee ice cream. Oh well, it was a lovely one time experience.",

Jamon was nothing to write home about: the four years of aging didn't make the meat better. Rib meat was decent but not fantastic. I've had better cuts of rib meat from Costco. To their credit, desserts were decent. Service was mechanical. Our server was professional, but didn't seem very sincere. Dude was seriously on script to sell you the highest priced item. For $500 for three people, I would have preferred Craft for a fraction of the price. That despite believing that Craft has gone downhill lately.",

    "text": "Jose, Jose, Jose.  Had been to the Bar Centro before and had the amazing Foieffle, Cotton Candy Foie, Sloppy Joe, Uni and a few delectable drinks...debated if going to the actual restaurant would be worth it since it seems not so much molecular gastronomy happens.  Just more of a 'carnivore's paradise.'  And oh, is it ever...with just enough finesse to be typical Jose genius.      Already having researched the extensive menu, my boyfriend and I decided what we wanted before we sat down.  However, we were offered 3 tasting menus...went with the \"mid\" range priced one because it had everything we'd wanted to try and more for what seemed to be a bargain (including the insane $70 jamon iberico that we would NOT have ordered a la carte)!  If you're not familiar with the restaurant concept, look at the menu beforehand.  I may have missed some courses, but what I remember:  Ferran Adria Olives-JUST like in that Bourdain episode...*eyes roll to the back of your head* Crispy Chicarron- fun to break at the table, tasty w/ the yogurt, but other than the presentation  nothing special Caviar Flight- beautiful, balanced/delicate, great selection, fun to assemble in the pomme souffles Caviar Cones- delicious Smoked Oysters - so flavorful Vittore 1950 Carpaccio- WOW..textures, balance of flavors, melt-in-your-mouth  Jamon Iberico- OMFG...can every animal be free-range, acorn fed?  Savored this as long as possible...every bite I had a moment of silence with eyes closed as the nutty,caramel, meaty flavors melted on my tongue. Sounds dramatic.  But the flavor is dramatic.  Classic Tartare- Surprisingly so enjoyable, very vibrant flavors, amazing presentation. Hands down the BEST beef tartare we'd ever had. Gazpacho- good, nothing special Croquetas de Pollo- good, nothing special, just like at Jaleo Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega (Octopus)- So well balanced in flavors.  I normally don't like octopus, but this is prepared so perfectly, not rubbery/chewy at all.   Butifarra Pork Sausage-- SO good...with the pan de cristal, this ALONE could be an enjoyable meal ****Now...at this point in the meal, we were SO stuffed.  Amazingly full, to the point where these last several dishes were just unnecessary. They just weren't even enjoyable.  HOWEVER, we agreed pretty easily, that if we had ordered these without having eaten anything before...we would've been pretty disappointed.   ------- Rib Eye-- really dry, super tough yet chewy, severely lacked in flavor.  Not sure WHICH cut we had...but wow, I'm sad to say it may have been the worst steaks I've had in a restaurant.   Bouchon Potatoes- creamy and buttery as reviewed by so many Asparagus- well cooked, but nothing outstanding about the flavors Carrots- same as the asparagus  BOX of dessert (11, ELEVEN!!, different treats)-- should've just taken it home, but wouldn't have kept well since we weren't going home until the next day :)  The bon-bons and tarts were delicious...everything else was okay.    Despite being disappointed by a few courses towards the end, there were enough stand-outs to rate this as an amazing dining experience.  Our drinks (When Doves Cry [the signature], Gin and Tonic, Manhattans) were great. Ambience and service were great.",

Second, the food was fantastic. We had: Chicken Croquettes, Fois Gras Cotton Candy, Tuna Tartar, Jose's Tacos, Oysters, Brussel sprouts, Veal Chop, Skirt Steak, Delmonico potatoes, and Robuchon potatoes. If it sounds like a lot of food, thats because it was. But everything was amazing. I left the restaurant full and happy. The skirt steak was the most tender steak I have ever eaten.  Third (and probably most important); the service. The service was incredible. Our server Tony has a passion for what he does, and it shows. I have been to great restaurants that I hated because the service was terrible or the server was grumpy. In a nice restaurant, service can make or break the experience, and in this case, the service definitely MADE the experience. The manager Hien was fantastic. He repeatedly checked on us to make sure everything was to our liking. You can see the employees here pay attention to the details, which makes this place well worth every penny spent.   I highly recommend!",

I had him choose a glass of wine for me, preferably a sangria taste, and he brought back a glass better than what I was expecting. This place is perfect for family gatherings, friends, or a date for two. You won't be disappointed! By far, THE BEST dining experience I've had out all places in Las Vegas.

Flavors were so disappointing.   Very plain simple flavors, nothing even coming close to complex or interesting. Most were just ridiculously salty.  I don't an more expensive dinner when it is worth the taste. However, we spent over $100 per person, for what equated to a container of salt slapped down on the table.",

    "text": "I think the average of 4 stars is about right for Bazaar Meat. It was a tough call between that and 5 stars because the food was excellent.  I went with a friend and although we had a reservation, we still had to wait about 10 minutes for a table even though it didn't seem super busy. They have a neat display of the various cuts of meat just as you walk in.   The meal was excellent, but the pacing of it was a little off. Our waiter explained they have several kitchens making the various items (Grill, Charcuterie, Veggies, etc) and to expect food to come out at different times. This would allow everyone at the table to share. He also said it would take about 50 minutes for our steak, and asked if we wanted any other starters beyond the Vittore 1950 Carpaccio (which was good, but next time I'll try the Beef & Parmesan Grissini he recommended). We passed, and waited patiently for the steak. I did order an LN2 cocktail, which was more like a boozy sorbet made with liquid nitrogen. It tasted great and helped pass the time as it was made table side. Beers started at $13, which is a lot even though they had some nice craft options.  Once our steak came (our waiter upsold us to a two lb Lindsay Ranch, OR, Washugyu/Angus) , it took another 10 minutes for the Robuchon potatoes (buttery amazingness) to come out, and then it took another 10 minutes or so for the Catalan Spinach (sweet and delicious).  I wouldn't have minded if a bunch of appetizers had come out at different times, but we would've preferred to enjoy the steak and sides at the same time, especially with the 50 minute wait time.  The steak was very well seasoned, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra $20-30 from the other beef rib steak options.   All in all, we had a great meal. 5* for the food, 4* for the price and pacing of the meal. I'd love to do one of the tasting menus some day.",

    "text": "First, let me be clear that our night did NOT go perfectly. However, the management did a very very good job of recovering and the food was good enough to smooth things over. Mistakes happen and I think restaurants deserve credit for handling mistakes well. I can't give them a 5 but I will give them a 4 and will return in the future with high expectations. I would like to mention our waiter, Oscar, did good work.   On to the food, it you know Jose Andres, you know that not everything is going to be straight-forward. To me, this is a big plus, to the group from Russia next to us at the bar, this might not have been, since they started flicking all the foam off their drinks.  I have been to Mini-Bar, e, and Jaleo so I knew what to expect.   Cocktails: We had the \"Penecillin\" a whiskey based drink misted with a extremely with a extremely smokey/peaty laphroaig scotch. Excellent, but it took 15 minutes to get it.  We also had the Honey-Truffle drink (Bees and Honey? or something) which I didn't love by my wife liked so much she ordered them all night. At the very least it was an interesting combination of sweet and savory.   Foie and Cotton candy bite; These are goofy, fun and really tasty. Worth getting.   Spherized olives with whole olives: Always fun, but EXTREMELY potent. If you don't love olives and anchovies you wont love these. They totally blew out my taste buds, but I enjoyed them.   Gazpacho Shots: Very tasty, and a great palate cleanser. Not totally necessary though.   Smoked Oysters: My wife is a big oyster fan, but I can take or leave them. These, however, were really great. The smoke presentation is both a novelty and a compliment to flavored foam. I wished they would have loosened them as I had to dig around in the foam to get them to separate.  Salmon Tartar: Ya, so this is totally excellent. The Salmon roe, however, isn't necessary and throws off the balance of the the dish. Just eat it separately as we did. The crispy seaweed crackers are great but so delicate. Need to be twice as thick.   Steak Tartar \"The classic\": These guys KNOW tartar, wonderful I could just eat that all night. Its not classic though, its much better.   Steak Carpacio Grissini: Served on a bread stick, it is pretty fun, but lets not kid ourselves, this dish is ALL about that parmigiana espuma. Dear god, I could just eat that with a spoon. Did I double and triple dip? Yes. Yes I did. Now, is it worth $26? Eh, probably not, you are paying for the wagyu which really isn't the star of the show.   Giant Chicharron : Its  giant and delicious. It won't blow your mind, but it makes a great thing to nibble on between courses.   Robuchon potatoes: Do you want to die young? And happy? Get these.   Wagyu Beef Cheeks with Mojo rojo: Holy Crap, why is this stuck down in \"other meats\" ?  This should be front and center. I can get great steaks at a dozen other place in the city, but this dish is a standout and unique.    All-in-all I give this place a strong thumbs up. It is not as daring as E or as polished Rubechon but it is fun and tasty and we will be back soon.   Notes for the restaurant:  1) Hand the women the menu first 2) I would appreciate some assistance with sizing. The foie is a single bite, the olives are ten bites. How am I to know what a \"small bites\" means.  3) Your bar staff needs more staff.  4) It would be good if you could help smaller groups order the right amount of food. When two people are about to order too much, you should let us know. 5) Your by-the-glass selections are kinda weak.",

Our server, Chris, took an enormous amount of time and patience with us as we made our menu choices. It was a feast! We had: little greens salad, shrimp and crab cocktail, tuna carpaccio, beef carpaccio (recommended by our server), grilled octopus, straw potatoes, cauliflower steak and a rack of lamb. Each and every dish was wonderful. It amazes me how a chef can take ingredients and create something that compliments each other. Perfect example is the grilled octopus. To me, by itself, it was on the bland side. But, pair it with one of the slices of potato it was served with and it's magic. I think to use the term 'pricey' is subjective. In this case, it was money well spent. Thank You Chef Jose!!",

I read reviews that stated that customer service was bad at this restaurant.... I don't know what the individuals were talking about?!? From the minute we got there, our waiter Michael and his side-kick who filled our water every time it was half way full, treated us like we were celebrities! They answered every question that we had about the menu and throughout our 10 course meal. Yes, it was pricey but worth every penny!!! Every dish that was brought out just kept getting better and better. Our most favorite dishes were the shrimp and crab cocktail, rib-eye cooked to perfection, mashed potato was to die for, oyster with a kick, and desert that topped it all off.  This is definitely going to be our new favorite restaurant!",

And all of the little things (caviar, the smoked Manhattan) were so good that it combined to be the most memorable meal that I have ever had. The ambiance was cool, hip and fun (there were alligators on the wall and pictures of animals in the seats.). It is clear to see why it is a \"top five\" steakhouse in the country.",

It's like being in the forest and then hunting all at the same time. Ordered the quarter pig , it was good but not worth $140. I can get the same thing back home at an Asian store for less than $20. The slices of various meat combination plate for about $70 was totally not worth it. There was only one meat that was good, the rest tasted like dry salami or sausage. The cotton candy foie gras was ok, the candy was too overwhelming. The chicken croquetas shoe presentation was unique but that was it. Tasted like fried cheese ball. Oysters were fresh, but you can get that almost anywhere. The steak was dry, I'll pass.",

    "text": "We did not have a great experience at Bazaar Meat, and there are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas for me to give this place a positive recommendation.  First, this is not your traditional steakhouse and is instead a hybrid of a tapas bar and a steakhouse.  The tapas aspect is actually what attracted us to the restaurant.  However, you should be aware that many of the steak options can only be shared between multiple people and they can't do cuts for a single person.  This was disappointing as my wife and I have different preferences in our steak cuts.  I'm not counting this against the restaurant in my star rating, but it would have been good to know going in.  Our negative experience comes partly from the service.  The service started out very good, but our server disappeared about half-way through the meal.  It took over 20 minutes to get drinks we ordered, my wife's steak was overcooked but nobody came by to check on how our entrees came out, we weren't shown a desert tray, and it took forever to get the check.  The second aspect of the negative experience I alluded to above: My wife's steak was badly overcooked.  That is really not acceptable at a high-end steak house.  Furthermore, the steak was sliced before they put it on the plate so they had to be aware that it was badly overcooked.  How many things have to break down for something like that to get delivered to the table?  The third aspect of the negative experience was that nothing was all that phenomenal.  When you are paying the prices they ask at a restaurant like Bazaar Meat, I expect to taste some memorable dishes.  Even among the dishes that were prepared properly nothing we had was particularly memorable.  Later in our visit we inadvertently ate at another Jose Andres restaurant, Jaleo.  We would not have eaten there based on our experience at Bazaar Meat had we realized they were owned by the same person.  I'm glad we didn't make the connection beforehand, because our experience at Jaleo was much better.",

The food is delightful...even when our expectations are high since they are a James beard new restaurant winner.  We started with Jose Andres taco which is a thin slice of jamon iberico wrapped in seaweed and topped with roe.  We then moved on to the Lucia ceasar salad which is a fun take on endive with grated Parmesan and crispy anchovies.  Both were memorable and delicious.  We ordered the bone in loin strip with miso sauce and grilled corn.  Everything was spot on party in the mouth delicious.  Definitely food I will crave again when I go back to Vegas!",

We decided to and am very glad we did.  The service and food was impeccable last night as I suspected it would be.  We enjoyed gazpacho shots the massive and amazing chicharon some oysters the incredible roast pork sandwich all to start. Oh and the classic tartare again was off the charts.  A fabulous dish!    Then on to the star of the show... The 2.5 lb rib steak cooked to perfection at medium rare.  And that is what must happen at a steakhouse.  They need to take the beef I can't access as a consumer and use the kitchen tools (wood burning grill) I don't have to give me a unique dining experience.   Bravo.  Here's the deal.  When im spending the amount of money it takes to eat at a restaurant like this, I want it to be so good that I'm thinking about my friends or family rather than the price.  This was achieved last night.  Not everything was perfect but when something was wrong they used excellent service to make it right.  And that is why I would come back to this restaurant.   Thanks again.",

From the table side alchemist making infused cocktails with a nitrogen aspirator to molecular cotton candy foie gras to the suckling pig, Bazaar reminded me about how Joel Robuchon won his Michelin stars... Their Potatoes! Damn!   As a carnivore, I found my mouth watering at their selective and incredible butchery display. As an amateur chef, the Fire Stage and Josper ovens left me in awe.

The six in our party reviewed the menus for a while and then decided to let someone, me, take charge of figuring it out.  There are several bite-sized items to order by the piece.  Then there are tartars, carpaccios, cured meats, and shellfish selections to choose from.  The main course selections are again sized and price to share as well.  And, don't forget to order a couple of sides.  All-in-all there are some very interesting and delicious selections but it all becomes a bit overwhelming to try to figure this out as a group.  The irony is that you want to go as a group so that you can sample various things.  Our waiter was helpful in the navigation of it all.",

Everything on this menu is aimed to please and it is nothing short of amazing.   I also had the best cocktail I've ever tasted or experienced for that matter. It's called the Wood & Fire and is is just as much deliciousness as it is entertainment.   The wait staff is second to none.

What I would recommend is reserving the suckling pig before coming in. Sometimes they run out and the suckling pig is a must! Other plates I would recommend are: -Foie gras cotton candy: a mix of sweet and salty. - cheese steak air bread: crispy air bread with Topped with Kobe beef and melted cheese inside the bread.. TO DIE FOR. -Caesar salad: a unique twist, not your average Caesar salad.  -Beef cheeks: all I can say is yum yum yum!  -Passion fruit martini - magic mojito  And that's all I can think of right now, but they have a huge menu and the food is just phenomenal. Definitely a must when you come to Las Vegas!",

She was knowledgeable, patient, and friendly.  Overall wonderful experience - I'll be back!",

    "text": "AH-MAY-ZING.  I loved every second and every bite of my experience at Bazaar Meat. We did the tasting menu, which was a complete misnomer. Yes, it's very expensive, but you get SOOO much food. EIGHTEEN courses. Yep, you read that right. And while some of them are small, just two or three bites worth of food per person, there are other courses that are gigantic. The ribeye course for two people? It's an entire 16 oz. ribeye steak! Oh, and that 18 courses doesn't include dessert. When it comes time for that, you are so full, and they anticipate this, that they bring you a to-go box full of pastries, cakes, and candies. Seriously, SO. MUCH. FOOD.  The really great thing about the tasting menu, though, is that you're not limited to what's on the menu. You can substitute anything from the main menu onto the tasting menu, and no, this isn't limited to substituting one vegetable for another. If you want, you can substitute a course of beef cheek for the brussels sprouts. They will do whatever you want, and at the price you're paying, I'm quite glad that they do. Our waiter was quite eager to customize the menu to our tastes, and he happily offered suggestions on what he thought should be eliminated and what should be substituted.  Ok, but now on to the specifics. This may sound weird for a place that has \"meat\" in its name, but the gazpacho is incredible. Perhaps it's just a refreshing break from all of the meat courses, but it was really, really good. All of the tartares and carpaccios are delicious as well. And I loved the cotton candy mojito. They pour the alcohol table side over the cotton candy to dissolve it into the drink. It's cool to watch, and it's one of the best-tasting mojitos I've ever had too.  This place isn't easy on the wallet, at least not for most of us. But it was an incredible dining experience, and if you can afford it (or if you win big at the casino), definitely stop in. It will be well worth it.",

I had the skirt steak and the butter mashed potatoes. One bite of the potatoes and I felt like I had a mouthful of salt! Way too salty. I understand they use lots of butter, but surely they would use unsalted butter? It was too salty to eat and ruined the taste for the meat, which was also quite salty. I think they should prepare things with little salt and let the customer add if they want. The girl was nice and took the potatoes off my bill. I would not go back. Walked out feeling hungry and disappointed.",

    "text": "Just finished a dinner here with my wife, and Bazaar Meat has definitely earned itself a spot among our must visit restaurants when we're visiting Vegas.   The floor itself is fascinating, with multiple open kitchens including a wood grill that filled the room with the pleasant aroma of grill smoke. There's a butcher case with available meats on display, including the certification for their Kobe beef. It's a unique ambiance that sets the stage for the food itself.   We ordered a mix of dishes, including the charred octopus, rack of lamb, and salmon tartare, and they didn't disappoint. The tartare, served with nori crackers, was rich and flavorful. The octopus was the highlight of the meal, wonderfully tender with a perfect char and served with a crazy aoli that tied the dish together. The lamb was tender, juicy, and rare, with just a hint of mint.   I have to mention the sides too, which were exquisite. The robuchon potatoes were absolutely decadent, with an unbelievably creamy texture and enough butter to make Paula Dean weep. The asparagus and romesco was flavorful and grilled to perfection, and the button mushrooms were dripping with garlic and lemon.   Our server Eric was on point all night, checking up on us frequently and willing to take time to explain the menu and run through every dessert (including an amazing casis marshmalllw).   If you're on the Strip, don't be afraid to make the trip to Bazaar Meat at the SLS. It is an experience not to be missed.",

I could not chew this meat and honestly I have had better steak at an average steak house. Although the wine list is vast, the sommelier is incompetent with lack of knowledge and execution. We also ordered a suckling pig for the table which was very dry  Over all, don't waist your money on this restaurant. There are plenty of good restaurants in Las Vegas",

Our server was spot on and very well informed of the menu and provided us several suggestions considering our time constraints.  We were so eager to try the succulent pig, BUT -- KEEP IN MIND... it takes ~1 hr to prepare. We had a show to catch immediately following and asked our server regarding our time constraints and he assured us it would arrive with enough time for us to savor and enjoy rather than scarf it down.   this pig though... it was absolutely delicious and worth the wait. it just melts in your mouth... then *crunch* goes the skin. now... here's the filipino side of me speaking... but it would have been great to pair my lechon with a bowl of steamed white rice. word!  we also ordered the kobe beef and to die for... it just melts in your mouth... i didn't even want to chew it b'coz i just wanted to savor and hold on to that taste.   highlight of the night... for the birthday boy... instead of your ordinary dessert. Our server whipped up an alcoholic dessert beverage table-side for us to enjoy. the name of it escapes me at the moment, but it was kind of like a sorbet with alcohol. icing on the cake!",

A bone ribeye (my go to) was $75 a pound and minimum size steak of 2lbs - I figured I had to try it. The beef was so tough the steak knife couldn't cut it. By the way it takes an hour for them to cook this sacred rib eye. From my opinion the emperor has no clothes.",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat is one of those restaurants that had me do a double take after a much improved second visit.  My first dinner here was a large group dinner where we split a pig, steak, and many sides between 9 people.  I felt that the pig and steaks were expensive and did not offer a significant value at the price point; it was a three star experience for me.  I hesitated to return, but I'm glad I did.  For my second visit here a friend and I opted to only order small dishes and appetizers; I highly suggest going this route.  The dishes are perfect for two to three people to share, and you get to experience the creativity in the rest of the menu.  Repeats Eats: Cotton Candy Foie Gras - A small, one bite treat.  As the cotton candy and sugar dissolve, it slowly exposes the savory foie inside. The Classic Tartare - Delicious.  The best tartare I've had. The Foieffle - Super rich.  It's good, but even with splitting it in half, I'd be okay with an even smaller portion.  I can't imagine eating this by myself. Fried Oxtail Steamed Bun - Very decadent, and very juicy.  I'd eat a whole one by myself.  Small but worth the price. Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega - Very tender pieces of octopus served with potatoes.   Fresh Sea Urchin - Uni, iberico lardo, served on toasted bread.  Great for sharing. Wagyu Beef Cheeks - Incredibly tender, bold flavors, made me not want to share  Eh: Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron - It's neat because it's big.  It's a stronger flavored chicharron. Suckling Pig - Dry and lacking in flavor.  Portions were tender, but tended to be the exception. Beef Rib Steak - I think we had the Michima Reserve? Good, but expensive, steak.  I didn't feel like the value was there. Braised Lamb Neck - Not bad, but forgettable. Tortilla Sacromonte - An omelet with all sorts of animal parts.  I liked the idea, but the execution was just okay for me. Robuchon Potatoes - It's like eating a bowl of butter.  That can be a good or a bad things, depending on the person eating said bowl of butter.  Overall there are some definite hits in the small dishes portions of the menu, and I really look forward to returning for them.  However, if you're looking to come here for the pig or the steak, I'd recommend supplementing your meal with lots of small dishes instead of only ordering the meats.  Final note: You should probably rethink your menu design if it weighs more than a pound, is larger than a Pizza Hut Bigfoot pizza, and requires a screwdriver and an Allen key to assemble.  Seriously, the poor hosts should get a commission every time they have to seat a table of three or more, because those menus present a potential workers comp claim.",

    "text": "Been twice to this restaurant in a year.  First time, service and food was impeccable! Everything was on point.  I happened to come here to celebrate a belated 40th birthday that was long overdue. The postponement was almost ten months in the making but it was well worth it!    Fast forward eight months to August 2016, I am hosting top VIP clients from TX. They have an astuteness for fine meats and other delectables. I took initiative in making a reservation here.  My second time around was slightly disappointing. The restaurant has different levels of tasting menus.  I recall selecting the best tasting menu during my birthday and was hoping to do so again my second time around. To my dismay the restaurant decided to streamline their tasting menus and retired the one I had. Nothing even came close to the one I had before. I had asked our waiter what happened to the tasting menu with the caviar service, etc....the waiter stated it was not too popular in the Las Vegas market and decided it was time to retire that service.  Good enough for me.  I ended up ordering the best tasting menu they had that evening.  I invited the sommelier to my table to recommend a good red and white wine for the pairings.  I have to say, the sommelier had no personality and never once asked us what we ordered. She figured by asking the waiter she was going to figure out the pairings.  What really offended me was that the sommelier did not ask me the price range I wanted to spend for the wines as they can creep up on you in the hundreds if not thousands per bottle at this joint.  I had to be very assertive to the sommelier and explained to her what I was looking for since she had no idea about prices.   After a few minutes with her and she couldn't tell me the 'price' which I found odd, I decided to go with my instinct and ordered a Lafite Rothschild, Schaefer, and other wines for the table. Oddly enough, every single one I ordered was sold out.  So I ended up going for her recommendations which I found to be extremely odd.  I wasn't impressed with her palette and selection, but I found it to be a talking point for my clients about it.  I can't recall the wine she ordered for us (wasn't memorable) but I do know that I paid $185 per bottle and we had six of them.  Alas, a great place to celebrate milestones and entertaining VIP clients. I don't think I would ever use the sommelier at this place again.  I have a better nose than the one that assisted us that evening.",

The tartare, the pig and Jose's Taco are some of the things that stick out in my mind, but there wasn't a bite of anything that I didn't enjoy. My problem was that my group felt rushed throughout the meal. There wasn't a break in between courses and most of the time the next course was presented before we were even finished with what came before. When the Kobe beef came out (the part I was mostly looking forward to) they started delivering all the other food and it took away from the presentation and time to enjoy that delicacy. I would expect a restaurant of this caliber to have timing figured out to give the guests time to enjoy each course and socialize a little instead of trying to get everything out so they could get us out the door.  I read that they give out certificates when you get the Kobe beef but either they don't do that anymore or in their haste they forgot to give it to us.",

    "text": "We dined at Bazaar Meats last night for the first time and it will be the last.  Oversized menu's, horrible food and ok/borderline acceptable service.  None of the meat on the menu looked appetizing to us. Paying per pound at min. $50/lb and we were told that most steaks were 2-2.5lbs each.  The veal chop was the only thing we were considering ordering. We decided to start with a bunch of apps and then maybe order the veal chop after we tasted some of the menu. Glad we did!  We ordered chicken croquets, just ok.  Dozen oysters - We are oyster connoisseurs and will always order oysters if they are on a menu. These didn't taste fresh, very very briny and salty. The three sauces they served with it were horrible. We just ate them with fresh lemon juice b/c we were starving. In hindsight they should have been sent back. Thank god we did not get sick!  Beef Carpaccio - was served wrapped around a breadstick dripping in oil. Beef was very good actually and tender, but the presentation sucked and the waiter suggested we order this one over another, but failed to explain that it would not be on plate, rather wrapped for us on a breadstick.  Tuna sashimi - horrible presentation. Got 9 small pieces of sashimi for $48. Took one bite and sent it back. Very fishy.  Salmon tartar - Also sent back to the kitchen. Very very salty. Too many capers. couldn't eat more than 2 bites. they also sent these greasy \"chips\" with it. We couldn't even look at them.  At this point, we had sent back 2 items in a row (tuna and salmon tartar) and probably should have sent back everything to be honest.    We told the waiter we were disappointed and got the check. He seemed embarrassed and just softly apologized. I think he was new to waitering. His service was just ok.  Would NOT go back. If you're a foodie like us, don't waste your time or money.",

The restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it and most of the staff were friendly on my visit.   The bar has a cool dripping blood sculpture as a chandelier. We had a glass of sake(good), truffles n bees(unique), don't be a lemon(refreshing), and the infamous magic mojito(don't get it). Mojito puts on a good show but falls short on taste. It's just waaay too sweet. It's like sucking on a sugar coated lemon lol. They tried to fix it by adding soda and putting it on the rocks but with no prevail, still yuck.   Eric was our server tonight and his choice of words to me were loose? Lol. As if we were homeboys..I guess. Anyway, just because I have nikes on doesn't mean I don't like the well spoken service. It's alright tho we played along.   1=never again 2=just ok 4=Delicious  We ordered: Cotton candy foie-1 Foiefle-2 Chicken croquets-4 Classic tartare-2 Chicharon w Greek yogurt-2 blood sausage and uni-2 --------- Wagyu beef cheeks-4 8 yr old Holstein bone in ribeye-1 Delmonico potatoes-1 Cauliflower steak-1 --------- Passion fruit / green tea cake-2 Salted caramel ice cream-4 --------- Honestly, the best bite of the night was the croquets. I would definitely order those again. I love foie gras so I had to order some foie inspired tapas but neither the foiefle or cotton candy foie impress me. Foiefle was over powered with peanut butter and the cotton candy was eeeh. Wagyu beef cheeks were oh so tender and delicious.  Finally, our \"Mindful meat. CA. 7-8 yr old Holstein cow\" ribeye arrives. Looks can be deceiving and no matter how much you hype it up. It all comes down to taste and that's where it missed. The steak was tasteless, bland, and non impressive whatsoever. Our side dishes came after we were half way done with our steak. I brought my concerns to Eric's attention but did nothing to suffice the problem but a cup of salt. Submissive laughs shared between my date and I, so we said \"f*** it\". finished up and left. Eric was wonderful nonetheless but he could've handled my complaint better.   2.5 Stars",

Having dined at Bazaar in SoBe Shady and VERY lucky companion were expecting a high standard and Meats delivered.  Starting with a nice bottle of Piorat Les Brugeres crisp white wine at the elegant bar, the meal commenced. A little skeptical of the cotton candy foie gras, Shady was blown away by the tastes as he devoured the swirl whole as recommended. Outstanding. 1 per person was not enough!. Next up was the Iberico ham board, which never fails to deliver. For the main, the Chateaubriand for 2, Robuchon mashed potatoes and some asparagus completed a meat lovers paradise. The meats were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were buttery heaven , and the desserts were spot on.  Having learned from previous meals, Shady did not over order and the meal was perfect for 2. Bill for all including wine + Shady's ALWAYS generous tip was an eye opening 405$. But sooo worth it. A fitting conclusion to another Vegas culinary eat-quest. Make the journey to the north end of the strip for this meat lover's masterpiece.",

I will say my first impression walking into the restaurant was a good one. The decor is very interesting and inviting.  The hostess was very pleasant.  We arrived a bit early so we were directed to the bar to wait for our table.   The cocktail menu was very unique and my choice was  the Smokey Manhattan that was delicious.   Shortly after arriving we were seated.  From that point on I was very disappointed.   The menu is so limiting.  All the steak sizes are huge and there are really no other choices. We all wanted steak however we didn't all want the same cut or to have it prepared the same way.  This was not a option.  The way they do it is large and medium rare we were told by the waitress.   My friend likes her steak well done and the only way they would accommodate her was for us to order a large steak, have them serve it to the table.  All of us were then suppose to take what we wanted and then they returned her portion to the kitchen to be cooked for a additional time.   Her part came back 15 minutes later.  Not a great way to enjoy dinner with friends.   Although the steak did have a good flavor it was tough and not a great piece of meat.  Especially not for the price!    For me I would have  to say it was the worst dining experience I have every had.  I guess maybe if you have a large group, all of you want the same meat, cooked the same way it would be a passable steak house but there are certainly many better options.",

    "text": "Holy Moly. This was the absolute BEST!  We came here for a couple of appetizers and everything was so so so good!  --Cotton Candy Foie Gras Lollipops- I would describe these as the perfect bite. These come on a stock, foie Gras in the middle, and cotton Candy wrapped around the outside. Like I said, the perfect bite!  --Suckling Pig Sandwich- my husband said this was the best sandwich he has ever had in his life. Although it may not be the best I have had, it was in the top best 3 I have had in my life. Every bite was perfect!  --Sloppy Joe - forget the actual full name but these were good too, not the best but really good.  -- Kobe Beef on Air bread - another WOW dish, this had raw real Kobe beef on top with some kind of parmesan foam in the middle of a light bread. Another \"perfect bite\" dish.   --We also had some of their cocktails, and all were amazing. This place is pretty expensive but worth every dollar. I love these types of places, but also hate them because I always spend so much money and don't even feel bad about it  Will be back FOR SURE!!!",

    "text": "LOVE this place.  $$$$ BUT WORTH IT!  Best meal/FEAST of my life!   SOME LITTLE STARTERS: Cotton Candy Foie Gras ($8 each): perfect little shot of foie gras. the tint of sweetness is perfect Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & traditional ($16): Very interesting.  So much flavor in your traditional olive and the Ligquid green olive is (literally) bursting with the same flavor Bagels & Lox Cone: ($6) Two-bite cone.  Perfect portions and strong (in a good way) flavors to capture that traditional lox & bagel taste with the cream cheese and salmon roe. Reuben ($14): I know this is silly but I like to think of them as bougie adult lunchables hehe Air bread filled with a cheese (white sauce - tasted to me like creamy ass cheese. glorious) with thin slices of yummy beef on top   FROM THE RAW BAR: Geoduck ($26): I have NEVER had this in my life.  and I liked it!  I'm not too sure about the TASTE itself but i loved the texture (which isn't what i say often lol)  Perfect with some soy cause King Crab & Shrimp Cocktail ($32): Uhh... Can't go wrong. amaze-balls.  Nice, big chunks of crab and big shrimp. More please!  Smoke & Ice Fresh Oysters ($24): You can smell the apple wood-smoke when you go to slurp down the oysters   FROM THE MEAT BAR:  The Classic ($24): Beef sirloin tartar with mustard, egg yolk, hp sauce and some hot sauce!  They make it AT your table.  Nice little show for you to see it all come together.  Serve with some cute ass bread rolls.  They make it pretty well but they will ask someone at the table to taste it and to add either oil, hp sauce, or hot sauce to their liking.  I had them add just a tad more hp sauce.  Perfect hot sauce kick.   Beef & Parmesan Brissini ($26): Washugyu beef wrapped around a breadstick.  The onion puree-- dank.   SOME LITTLE SANDWHICHES:  THE Foieffle ($12) Air waffles with a peanutbutter taste and honey drizzled.  Yum.  SWEET  FROM THE FIRE PIT Suckling Pig ($160 quarter/$540 whole): MUST PRE-ORDER. AND IT'S WORTH IT TO PREORDER!!  I've never had such a TENDER pig before.  Yummy, yummy skin.  Steak: ugh. Can't go wrong.  Nice thick ass pieces and done perfectly. They are pretty on point with making it the way you want it too.  Nicely cut and ready to share.  Fresh Sea Urchin($26): Uni flatbread. amazing. just... order it.   VEGETABLES & SALADS:  Grilled BAby Corn ($16) Baby corn done like elotes.  Good but I was aiite at this point  Piquillo Peppers ($13) perfectly grilled.  I love how it was charred  Setas al Ajillo ($15): MUSHROOMS with liquid gooodnessss  A SIMPLE TOMATO SALAD: ($15) My friend said that they put the tomatoes in boiling water for a bit to break down the skin of the tomato but it's not messy.  It's perfectly soft.  This was SO refreshing and definitely nice to have between the different plates we ordered.    POTATOES:  I wanna say i got the Robuchon ($19)  LOTS of butter and creammyyyyy!  Good filler. But at this point, I was already at stomach capacity! haha   DRINKS:  I forgot what we had ordered but their bar makes great drinks.  We also had a liquid nitrogen cocktail (?) a barcardi infused sherbet-like cocktail  -- My friend ordered so I can't recall.  But ask your server!   SERVICE:  Super friendly. Fast.  Great recommendations.  Ask for OPLE'S recommendations.  You won't be disappointed :)  GUARENTEED!   AMBIENCE:  Classy.  Upscale.  Quiet.  Intimate.  We had 6 people and sat in a round table.  Loved how it was easier for us to converse.    Be prepared to drop $$ But seriously... best feast of my life!   :D Highly recommend!",

They have a special fixed price menu at the bar which allows you to try multiple items without having place full orders.   I got the croquetas de pollo, fresh oysters, the skirt steak, the mini sloppy Joe, the beef & parmesan grissini, and a glass of wine.   The beef & parmesan was unbelievable! Order it. ORDER A LOT OF IT!!!  Almost everything was fantastic except for the steak (which I had been looking forward to most). In my opinion, it didn't have enough flavor and was a little too tough, even for a skirt. I ordered it medium, and it to me it was more on the rare side and may have lacked seasoning.  Above all, the ambiance, service, food, were all fantastic. I think I'll try a different cut on my next vist.  A must try if you're in vegas!",

    "text": "My boyfriend asked me, how would you like to be romanced on Valentine's day? Without hesitation, I told him I wanted a MEATgasm.  Get your appetites ready to be seduced by Jose Andres's creative menu and somewhat primitive du jour dining experience. The temperature of the restaurant's dining room was engulfed by a sweltering heat that emanates from the open concept kitchen that lines the perimeter of the dining floor. Massive broilers, sparkling coals and rows of professional ovens surrounds the dining room and views of the fierce open flames in the background was a dramatic touch. Every seating arrangement had a prime view of the kitchen, where all of the action happened.  We came already well versed on the menu, but we definitely had some questions to ask our server as well. He was very knowledgeable and gave us great feedback on menu selections.  Cotton Candy Foie Gras - crispy amaranth $8/per: Jeez. It was so incredibly tasty! At first, it seems like it is just simple ol' cotton candy, but the foie gras is hidden inside and just wait until you get that perfect bite, nothing else matters. You will want to get angry with how good it is. We were seriously considering ordering a second, maybe fourth round. Flavor rating: 5/5  Croquetas de Pollo - Chicken-bechamel fritters $12: the creamiest, most luscious chicken bechamel croquetas served in a glass sneaker designed by Salma Hayek's brother (!!) truly a cool presentation. The breading on the croquetas were so perfect and encased inside was just the most decadent bechamel and succulent chicken. The seasoning just takes it to an addictive level. Hey, if the glass sneaker fits! Flavor rating: 5/5  The Classic Tartare - Beef sirloin, savory mustard, egg yolk, HP Sauce, anchovy, Parker House rolls $24: dramatic table-side presentation with helpful commentary on every ingredient that is being mixed in. I adored the festive Valentine's heart-shaped plating on a cold, over-sized marbled serving dish sprinkled with edible flowers; so gorgeous! The tartare is exquisite, the sirloin is the highest of quality, the sauce is slightly tangy and left us with very moist bites. It is served alongside warm Parker house rolls which are baked in meat fat (!!!!) Meat fat! It's a genius way to utilize flavor and oh boy! You can really taste the richness in flavor from the meat! I die. Flavor rating: 5/5  Sucking Pig Sandwich: served with horseradish aioli and caramelized onions (secret menu). The presentation offered 4 small and handy sandwiches. The bread was super thin and extra crispy, which added the perfect texture with every bite. However, as delicious as it sounded, we were a little unimpressed with the suckling pig; it was leaning towards dry and flavorless. The horseradish aioli, although tasty, was super pungent and overpowered the flavor of the entire sandwich. My favorite part of the sandwich was certainly the expertly grilled onions which brought so much character and caramelized sweetness. Flavor rating: 3/5  Wagyu Beef Cheeks Mojo rojo, oranges $36: 4 pieces of Wagyu beef broiled and succulent to the extreme. The orange wedges added a splash of brightness to the meat, however, the sauce was not as complex or even interesting as I would have wanted it to be. The sauce could have been left off of the dish and we would have still been fine with the excellent quality and preparation of the beef cheeks. Flavor rating: 3/5  Robuchon Potatoes $15: Can they even call these potatoes? Here is the exact description on the menu: Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes  - \"The most fattening potatoes I will ever ingest\", said our server as he smirked and placed the dish on our table. They weren't wrong about that. It is 99% butter, no joke. Insanely creamy, very silky, super naughty. It is as simple as you want to make of it though; just cream and butter whipped up until its airy. But I have no regrets (until the next day) Flavor rating: 4/5  Setas al Ajillo - Button mushrooms, garlic, lemon, arbol chile $12: Served comfortably on a thin layer of garlic and lemon puree which was divine and cooked with extreme purpose. The mushrooms were broiled with just the right tenderness. However, my hugest complaint was the arbol chile was nonexistent, maybe removed off the menu that evening unbeknownst to us. The mushrooms are cooked well, but note that it's still an extremely simple side; imagine 7 grilled buttery, garlicky mushrooms. Unless you are mushroom fans like us, you might not be missing it if you don't order it. Flavor rating: 4/5  The final note on the desert tray is also an artistic and modern display of their playful culinary style. Lots of jeweled tones, rich dark chocolates and fresh creams detected. We opted for the fresh vanilla bean cream, fresh strawberry & bacon on a thin cracker and we also selected one geometric shaped dark chocolate coffee truffle. The petite thin cracker with cream, strawberry and bacon was my favorite! Flavor rating: 4/5",

Waiter wasn't helpful guiding us through the menu, forgot to bring our wine we ordered but did leave it off the check thankfully. Left him a $60. Tip for working on Thanksgiving but really didn't feel it was deserved for quality of service . Just felt bad for him working on a holiday",

    "text": "So this is clearly a multi part review  Location  This is housed in the SLS hotel. Traditionally the SLS is a modern ultra sexy brand with sexy people staying in the hotel and partying in the hotel.  I excepted it to be like the Cosmo hotel in Vegas, it's more like the stratosphere.  The restaurant itself is sexy, large open kitchen and cool meat lockers displaying the aged meats  Service  Was on point. Everyone was attentive and gave great recommendation on the menu  Food  We ordered an aged rib eye that ran $95 per pound. We had 6 adults and ordered 2 of them at a total of 5 pounds. Yes, that was $500 worth of steaks. It was the best steak I have every had.  It was about 2 inches thick, the slow cook it over the smoke for about 39 mins, before the sear it off close to the coal.  Amazing flavor, smoke and tenderness!  The rest of the dishes had Jose flair, creativity and flavor.  I am not sure if I thought the rest of the meal was amazing... But very creative. Jose has many items with a Spanish flair and flavor.   Even though they are executed perfectly! I don't think the flavor profile hit my palate perfectly.  Overall an excellent experience, I think I would order a simpler menu next time and soak in the amazing beef! Please go and enjoy",

    "text": "Let's be honest, when looking for place to chow down in Vegas, most of the world's top Chefs own a piece of restaurant real estate in Sin City so the search can be overwhelming. The Mr and I were looking for an intimate, upscale, romantic, long more-than-a-bottle experience and we narrowed the choices down by way of cuisine and again, no shortage of Steakhouse's either. After skimming through reviews and stars to assist us in finding that new culinary adventure ... Bazaar Meat was our target.  We arrived about 20 minutes early as we generally start off with a drink and relax at the bar until our table is ready. We were happily greeted by the hostess and shown to the bar instantly upon arrival.  The bartender was a younger guy, friendly and helpful,  he crafted our cocktails in front of us and waited for us to taste them to ensure we were pleased. We chatted a bit with him and we scoped out the restaurant and all its gorgeousness.  Mr W and I LOVE to cook so when we spotted the wood burning grills across the bar we had to walk over and admire/stare/swoon/adore the equipment, technique and woods that are used to prepare the meats.  Oh the meats! Beautiful marbled cuts, hanging suckling pigs, legs and sausages all encased and on display. Simply glorious. A True Bazaar that you just want to walk through and admire. Everything is open which is also eye catching and inviting to your dining experience here.  We did a tasting menu and as stated in most of the reviews the foie gras wrapped in cotton candy is a delectable experience. Creamy with a crunch from the amaranth ( a Mexican cuisine staple used in candies as well ) and the cotton candy delicately melts around the foie gras as you bite. Mmmm! Perfect with the light bodied Pinot noir we selected.  The giant chicharron was airy and crisp with a light smokey seasoning and a yogurt dipping sauce.  We each had the tomato gazpacho ... Hmmm, tangy, spicy, no bell pepper, no it's lemon ... Pretty much we didn't know if we liked it or not. Not good with the Pinot (FYI) but not a bad dish either.  The pork sausage was dense, firm and full of flavor. Loved it! The skirt steak was cut thick and cooked at a perfect medium rare. Very tender and delicious.  By this time our Brunello was well decanted and we moved on to the wagyu beef cheeks. Holy Mary! So tender, so perfectly done we dubbed them the favorite dish of the night.  As you can tell, this experience lasted a few hours just as we had hoped and everything was more than memorable including the mini desserts.  5 stars \"the best we've had Vegas style\" review.",

    "text": "Sooo, this place was slammed during World of Concrete and AVN. We took the semi-private room in the back which was great for us to converse without loud back noise. We started with the cotton candy foie gras which seems odd but had a great taste and was a nice way to start this four hour dinner.  Table side wagyu tartare, Carpaccio and the Charcuterie platter.   The tartare was served with little dinner rolls in a cast iron tray and this was one of my favorite flavors of the night.  We sampled four steaks, the pork chop, and few orders of lamb chops.  Sadly not one had a memorable taste nor impressed me.  Side we had asparagus, spinach, brussels, their version of the \"best whipped potato\".  Worst whipped potato I've ever had.  I'm a full blown fat kid, I love butter and fatty flavors, this was like eating a stick of extra salty butter.  Not one of us enjoyed this and honestly maybe we picked the wrong sides to accompany our main course.  NOW let's move on to the dessert and the wine! Dessert was a spectacle that I could have sat and ate every piece.  It comes on this circus like display cart advertising all items making it hard to resist.  I tried several of the treats and each one so different in taste but every bite enticing me to keep eating.  Our Wine Sommelier kept the bottles on flow after going through 10ish bottles.  Our service was impeccable and I would go back just to see our server. Unfortunate I didn't catch her name she was amazing!",

    "text": "I went here hoping to get the Bazaar Meat experience, knowing full well the expensive menu that this place has. Personally, the cost wasn't an issue. I expected nothing less from a Jose Andres establishment. However, what I didn't expect was to have the serving staff completely forget to bring out a main course that was part of my prix fixe menu. This was not just for me, but for everyone in our party of 3. We didn't realize this until after we drove home, but by then it was already too late. This is a top-notch, world-renown restaurant with $$$$ price tags. The fact that this happened makes me feel disappointed by the negligence that came from the staff, and also upset that I was shorted out of my meal.   There's a saying in the hospitality industry that I always honor: Service everyone like they are worth a million bucks, because you never know if that person walking around in ripped jeans, or sweat pants might be the very person that's signing your paycheck. While I'm most definitely not that person, but I still consider myself a potential loyal customer, and a customer that's willing to spend money on something I love to do, which is fine dine. I mean, I get it. I work in the industry too and understand how restaurants operate on the Strip. When it comes to service, certain groups of people will get more attention than others. I'm referring to the VIPS, or big spenders. This is completely fine since it's all part of the ways of this industry, however, that doesn't mean the staff should forget about their regular diners. I bring this point up because throughout the night our server was obviously more focused on the other parties than us. You can tell that these tables were spending big money because the managers would occasionally check up on them, start small talk and refill their wine glasses. We weren't surprised, or were we expecting the managers to come to our table. However, what we didn't expect was the server to come around only a few times throughout the night and whenever he did, he only did so to ask us if we wanted to order more food. Perhaps it's because our tab wasn't as big as he'd hope? We each got the $85 restaurant week menu, some drinks, appetizers and extra entrees. The bill was $145 per person before tip. While I know this is on the low end for Bazaar Meat standards, but it was our first time dining here and we didn't come hungry. We were expecting to just sample the tasting menu to see what options we had for the future. Regardless of the amount, we were still paying customers. The least the server could do was pay attention to our dishes to make sure that we received them all. After all, isn't that the key part of being a server, let alone a fine dining one? Honestly, I don't think I\"ll be coming back to Bazaar Meat because the whole experience was a let down.   Food Review Some dishes were a hit. Some were a miss, but one thing's for sure, Bazaar's meat quality exceeds its reputation:   Cotton Candy Foie Gras: 1 bite-size piece of cotton candy displayed on a stick. Very unique. It's sweet then savory from the foie gras in the center. Definitely recommend.   Pork Skin Chicharron: Crispy pork skin dipped with Greek yogurt. Comes out in a gigantic piece that the runner breaks in front of you w/ a mallet. Very interesting concept but lacking in flavor. All you could taste was Greek yogurt w/ a dash of cinnamon/cumin flavor.  Gazpacho Shots: Thick and creamy. Tasted exactly like Thousand Island. Our least favorite.   Butifarra Spiral Sausage: Missing course  Skirt Steak, Rosewood Wagyu, TX: For skirt steak, it was very tender and had good temp. The rosemary mustard sauce was subtle and provided a good kick to the steak, and it wasn't overwhelming at all. I'd give it a 4/5 stars.  Buttered Potato Puree: Potatoes with massive amounts of butter. It melts in your mouth. Definitely worth ordering but it should be shared b/c it's extremely rich.   Setas al Ajillo: Button mushrooms grilled with garlic and some type of sauce. This was our favorite course. Extremely fragrant, slightly sweet and savory. Definitely recommend.   Croquetas de Jamon: Cured ham balls, crispy on the outside with creamy bechamel fillings. Came out inside of a plastic shoe. The smokey flavor of the ham was delicious, but it's also very salty.   Grilled Pulpo a la Gallega Octopus: Delicious chunks of fresh octopus in a tart tomato sauce. Best parts are the baby potatoes. They were slightly sweet and added a good balance to the dish.  Veal Chop: The veal was beyond tender and fragrant. Perfectly seasoned. However, I didn't like the sauce that it accompanied. It had a gamey taste (goat cheese, maybe?) and that overpowered the taste of the meat.   Don't be a Lemon Cocktail: Super cool presentation cocktail. The staff mixed it in front of you using liquid nitrogen. It came in a tiny mason type jar, and \"eaten\" like a tart slush. It was very good and extremely alcoholic. Definitely worth the price.",

    "text": "It's now been 2 days since our experience here. I have been putting off my review because I felt that if I started I wouldn't be able to stop. One could write a thesis on this place. The two most important points I can make are, 1: This was the best meal I have ever had in my life and it really wasn't close. 2: The service was impeccable. The Food: There was not one dish that was less than spectacular. We are from Seattle and are proud of our robust restaurant scene and we are fairly adventurous eaters. This was an experience that I believe will be the yard stick for future high end dining experiences. The tomato tartare was fresh and bright, a clever dish executed spot on. The Bison carpaccio was delicious and whimsical. The chefs selection of cured meats was unlike any charcuterie presentation I have had. The iberico ham was aged something like 36 months but had none of that ammonia funk associated with cured meats or strong cheese. It was like perfect meat candy. The other selections were amazing as well and ranged from smoky and spicy to sweet and fatty. The butter whipped potatoes where life changing (yes, potatoes and life changing.)....order them. The grilled octopus was a fun change of pace in between our \"turf-centric\" feast. It was crispy crunchy but amazingly tender and well balanced with a little acidic kick to brighten everything up. The cauliflower steak and grilled leaks were fun and delicious as well. Now, for the meats...we selected the Rosewood Angus/Wagyu Ribeye and the Wagyu skirt steak as well as a roasted chicken because one of us isn't big on red meat. The skirt steak was fabulous, the mustard sauce was so well balanced, it didn't overpower the beef as one might fear and the acidity of it played so well with the fat from the wagyu beef, so well executed. The star of the evening was the Ribeye and it delivered, it was about 2 inches thick with a perfect crust on the outside and an amazingly buttery center tender enough to cut with a fork. They put this awesome finishing salt on it with these large, flat flakes of sea salt that offered a little extra crunch from time to time. The best steaks I have ever had and I am one of those people that typically steers clear of steak houses because I tend to stick to the \"I can make a better steak at home\" philosophy.  The food... this place is good enough I'd hop on a plane to fly down for dinner and fly back after, its that good. The Service: I can honestly say that I left in amazement at how well planned and executed the service was here. Our waiter was friendly and polite. Attentive but not pushy. The little things. When he noticed the first bowl of potatoes wasn't going to make it all the way around the table he brought another. He noticed this in a busy restaurant while serving several other tables. He brought it out and explained that he wanted us all to be able to try some, he didn't ask and i don't even know if we were charged for it, he just made it happen. That is attention to detail. The Bison carpaccio typically comes with five servings and our party was six, so he added one to the plate. The Sommelier was very nice as well. We are casual wine drinkers with an appreciation but not necessarily a deep knowledge of wines and he wasn't snooty or standoffish. He offered some information on the wine and we discussed the selection as it related to our tastes and that vintage vs others. Just really friendly and welcoming to someone that is a little intimidated by the wine selection process. I guess I can sum up the experience by saying that when the check was presented at the end of the meal, and it was not an inexpensive meal, the proclamation was \"Worth It!\"",

    "text": "We've learned from the fare at the Cosmopolitan that Jose Andres can mix up some fine eats. At Bazaar Meat inside SLS, he shakes things up a bit, by breaking some rules and introducing diners to a new way of fine dining. I think he's offering a model that is pretty great. You can customize a meal here; more so, than I've seen elsewhere. Whether you're a party of thirty or a table for two they have you covered. For example, you can order a few tapas or a whole suckling pig. Even a vegetarian can have their needs met.   I suppose with that wide appeal, you would want seating for many guests. Bazaar Meat does not miss that mark. The dining room is huge. It seemed to go on for days when we were seated in the back not far from the raw bar. There are private rooms, communal tables, just a big ole mishmash of options. The decor is pretty eclectic too. It definitely brings the bizarre to Bazaar Meat. Open kitchens, mismatched chairs, antler chandeliers, alligator heads, I could go on and on...   You might run into some trouble snagging a reservation. I did. Open Table showed no availability. Upon calling, I was told they were fully committed. Odd for a Monday evening, only a major convention could fill the space. After checking with management the hostess said that she could squeeze us in. I was appreciative. It was a surprise to find a near empty cavernous space on arrival. Our two top was in the depths of the restaurant we only passed a few diners on the way. It was peculiar at first, but toward the end of our meal we weren't entirely alone.   The menu is extensive. In fact, our two framed menus were larger than our table. We had to joust to share the space. The menu is broken into a few sections: starters, raw bar including carpaccios and tartare, then there are soups, sandwiches and cured meats, and fire pit selections are followed by other meats, vegetables and salads. It takes a short bit to decipher the best attack plan. We started with the signature Cotton Candy Foie Gras ($8) and Classic Tartare ($24), followed by the Suckling Pig Sandwich ($14) and entree selections were Lamb Neck ($25) and Beef Cheeks ($36) with sides of Robuchon ($15) and Brussel Sprouts ($12).   The husband has been on a Moscow Mule kick lately, he was disappointed that it was not part of the cocktail program. He was told, they did not have the proper glassware. I opted for the Salt Air Margarita. I prefer the foam to the salted rim, since I tend to have a real knack for getting salt in my eye. I enjoyed the cocktail.   The Foie Gras Cotton Candy is a playful bite, at the center of the ribbons is a decadent torchon coated with amaranth. The Classic Tartare is the real star, I've heard it has tableside preparation, but ours did not. I've never had a better version. The sirloin is so velvety, almost buttery, what really sets it apart is the robust flavor from the Savora Mustard. The Parker Rolls are light and airy, and a nice accompaniment. The timing of the rest of meal was questionable. We had the Beef Cheeks first, they were tender, but overall fairly pedestrian. Next came the Suckling Pig Sandwich, and the Robuchon potatoes. These dishes are magic. Jose Andres pays homage to the man with the most delicious potatoes in all the land, with butter, butter and more butter. The sandwich is really stellar. I cannot recall ever having a better panini; succulent pork, sweet caramelized onions, tangy mustard and crispy bread. Again, it's the mustard really makes it sing. This, coming from a girl who detests yellow mustard, let it be said, all mustard is not created equal. The braised Lamb Neck and Brussel Sprouts were the last to arrive. The lamb was the weakest link of the meal. It was heavily salted. Not nearly as tender or flavorful as I had hoped. I'll stick to shanks, racks and chops. The Brussel Sprouts were just petals, they were light and refreshing. It was like a breath of fresh air after all the rich courses.   I've heard such high remarks given for service, our server was accommodating, but he was unpolished. He assumed we were dining for half price, while we'd love to, we weren't SLS employees. So, instantly, it left an impression we were overpaying for our meal. Then, he went on to explain how gamey and chewy the steaks can be. If it he had good intentions it certainly didn't entice us to try the steaks. Toward the end of our meal, we heard another server offer a nice welcome spiel to diners (that did qualify for 50%) that really showcased the restaurant's offerings. Despite a few flaws, overall, it was a pleasant experience... I'd return for the pork alone.",

We enjoyed snacks and drinks during happy hour in the bar and continued eating all the way until dessert.  The aged tomahawk ribeye was delicious as was the suckling pig.  The downside is that it is quite expensive and difficult to realize what the cost will be because the meats are priced by the pound.  With the compulsory 20% tip for 6+ people, it was $150 each.  The only negative is that my hair stunk from all of the meat smoke - not sexy.  The primary cause was that a table nearby ordered some meat that was grilled tableside and there probably was not any ventilation above their table.  Our waiter Chris was excellent, although I did have to push back quite a bit on the portions he recommended.  The cocktails were stellar - as expected.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had made reservations to Bazaar Meat for our anniversary - but you definitely don't have to wait for a special occasion to enjoy this restaurant. I had wanted to try it since we are both fans of Jose Andres' other restaurants in town and did not think we could be disappointed by this one. Plus we hadn't checked out SLS since it had opened.  Our reservation was for a Sunday night at 9pm. Before leaving, I had read other Yelp reviews to get an idea of what the must-try items were and what others had for suggestions, so I pretty much knew what I was going to get before we got there.  We arrived to SLS about 45mins early to walk around the place and explore. The hotel was smaller than we had imagined (and pretty dead inside) so we had a ton of time to kill. We figured we'd try to check in early in hopes of getting sat a little before 9, but to our luck, they were pretty full and the hostess suggested we wait at the bar with a couple of cocktails, so we did. I ordered the New York Sour and my bf got the Salt-air Margarita. Both were good. We've had the Salt-Air margaritas before at China Poblano at the Cosmo, there was nothing spectacular about this one, but it was tasty.  9pm came around and I was watching the hostess, hoping that our table would be next. She sat 2 other parties, that seemed to have arrived after us, before finally coming to get us around 9:15. I was a little peeved since we showed up early and the parties she sat before us showed up after. But who knows, maybe they were late for their 8:45 reservations. So whatev.  We started with the Cotton Candy Froie Gras ($8) which is a MUST-TRY. Heck order 2... or 3 each, but save room for other stuff too. It was spectacular in my mouth. We also order the Bison Carpaccio ($26) which may have been the most memorable and unique *flavor-wise* dish that we had all night. I felt like the pickled celery, blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce went nicely with the bison meat. Not your average buffalo wing. I had to try the Jamon Iberico ham as well, but it didn't come cheap at a whopping $70 for a platter of about 10-12 pieces of ham. However, it may have been the most delicious cured meat ham I have ever had. And since it was a special night, we said 'what the heck?!' and went for it.   For our main course, we decided to just get the Washugyu Ranch (OR) Flat Iron steak. My boyfriend chose that one because it had blue cheese on it, which was unfortunate considering it was possibly the WORST steak I've ever had in my life! I'm not sure if it was the cut of meat, or how it was prepared, but it was incredibly tough and chewy. I was even having very hard time cutting the steak with a knife. I would not recommend that anyone ever order the Flat Iron steak from here, unless you are wanting to eat beef jerky for dinner.  Due to the season, the veggies were limited and the one I had originally planned on getting (the Grilled Baby Corn) was not in season, so the waitress had recommended the Roasted Cauliflower ($12) and we also order the Delmonico Potatoes ($15) and the Robuchon Butter ($15) mashed potatoes (I'd read amazing reviews on it) Both were delicious. My only criticism would be that perhaps the Robuchon potatoes were a little too rich for my taste, but it did say it was basically ALL butter. haha.  After that, I was so full, that I couldn't even think of dessert, so I just ordered a coffee and watched my bf enjoy a Tiramisu cream puff and a bacon and strawberry thing.  This restaurants only flaw was that awful flat iron, but I've heard the other steaks are killer, so we may have just ordered the wrong piece of meat. Next time, we'll know better.",

I loved they have table side service and the server explains what they're doing.   The restaurant is beautiful, the seatings are so comfortable. Their open kitchen is what makes the experience different from other restaurants.   The foie gras cotton candy is a must have.  The steak tartare is by far the best I've had in a restaurant. It is served table side.   I am looking forward to The Bazaar in NYC!",

    "text": "First, let me be clear.  We did not officially eat at the restaurant.  Instead we sat at the bar and ordered the various appetizers.   Some were amazing, others I could have done without.   So here is a break down.   The cotton candy foie gras was strange.  The idea was better than the execution.   However, it was a unique taste.   The sloppy Joe was also a bit of a miss.   It is basically meat on an open toasted bread.   It was just okay.   Not great, you can skip it.  A MUST SKIP is the shoe fries. Salty, salty, salty, salty.   We sent them back and they did a new order which were equally as salty, salty, salty.  AVOID the shoe fries unless you like salt.  Now, moving to the MUST TRY.  The baby corn was amazing.  Small baby corn each covered in mayo and chilly.  I thought it could use more spice, but it was great.   The ensalada Lucia is also a must try.   Little bite size Caesar salads.   Each bite is delicious.  Another must try is the suckling pig sandwich (open food, not on the bar menu: but ask for it).   The roast pig is perfect on the bread with a dash of mint.   It is an amazing sandwich and ten times better than the sloppy Joe.  Ask for the pig, not the slop.  Now, if you want to try something different.   It is sweet, salty, and buttery all at the same time its the foiffle waffle.   It is an expensive little desert-like dish.   The mix of salt and sugar is interesting.   It is an acquired taste and thus would leave it as a must try for those who like to experiment different flavors all at once.   Over all, I would have given them 5 stars, but the sloppy Joe and the shoe string fries lowers the rating to a 4.   Great atmosphere and will go back and try the restaurant in the near future.",

Everything was fabulous - the food, the atmosphere, the service.  Everything is served tapas style, thus everyone at the table gets to try everything.  We enjoyed many items, and i honestly can't remember ever going to a restaurant where I totally loved every item.  Normally a few stand out, but everyone at the table loved it all.  The tastes were simply incredible.  We enjoyed the following. Jose's Asian Taco Croquetas de Pollo Vittore 1950 Carpaccio Jamon Iberico de Bellota* (Fermin, Salamanca, Spain Harris Ranch, CA, Black Angus Beef Rib Eye Dessert sampler  While when I go back, i would love to try some different items, it will be hard not to order these same items.  With cocktails and wine, and tip, we spen about $150 per person, and I great value in my opinion, by Vegas standards.  Can't recommend this restaurant highly enough.",

    "text": "Let me place this DISCLAIMER- I am not a traditional \"Foodie\" .. As much as I LOVE food I sadly am typically about QUANITY over QUALITY because I am CHEAP! I would NEVER and I mean NEVER in my life select and pick a restaurant like this on my own but I came to SLS for a YELP event and heard about this place and REALLY REALLY was dying to try it so my boyfriend SURPRISED me with reservations for my Birthday dinner... I barely could allow myself to look at the prices so I guess it was a good thing the menu was super Heavy! that is the one thing I honestly would say could use a change. The menu is on this huge heavy board that yes looks beautiful but it makes it hard to hold and frankly I probably would of ordered more items had it of been easier to handle but it was best I not look  because its so expensive  for someone like myself who is not usually a fan of spending more than 50 dollars on a entree/plate but I will say its worth EVERY penny...   I noticed some reviews had issues with servers so let me just say hands down our server rocked. Elias was his name and if you get a chance ASK for him because  not only was he REALLY REALLY friendly but he was not pushy at ALL. Plus he was attentive and paid attention to what was going on and kept us updated on the status of our food.He made sure we were aware of all the items and showed us the various tasting menus some of which looked really great to me but my boyfriend is the pickiest eater on earth so that was not a option for the evening but if I went again I would definitely try one of those out because it makes sense for the most bang for your buck.  Its a tapas style restaurant that seems best shared with numerous people if you want to try lots of stuff. Since I am mortified at the idea of anyone spending money on me I truly didn't order as much as I probably could have but we did have a amazing meal. I started off with a Cotton Candy Mojito that was delicious and definitely tons of fun to look at. For our starter we went with the - Chicken Croquettes which were really really delicious but also came out in a fun little converse style mold that is apparently Jose's favorite shoe and I love all that CHEESY stuff so it was definitely a winner. For our main course we went with the Suckling PIG which is so freaking AMAZING. It was the whole reason I wanted to try this place and it didn't disappoint me at all. I felt the balance and flavor was to DIE for and even if there was some fat that my boyfriend refused to partake in I seriously LOVED it. They serve the pig with a salad and it was super fresh and the tomato's were so great! I wish I would of known how much I would of loved the salad because I would of ordered more lucky for me the picky person I was with doesn't touch them so I had it all to myself but it really helps to add to the flavor of the pig. The QUALITY is so worth the $ and the wait so if you are looking for a speedy meal I would not waste your time trying this place because they warn you about the cooking times. Our potato side Pommes Paillasson made its way to our table before our pig did and it took ALOT of will power for us to hold off from eating them. I guess they make sure to bring the items out as they are finished but I usually HATE when stuff comes out separate but Elias made sure to let us know that it would be right out.  A fun part of the evening was getting to sit around and watch what other tables were ordering and all the fancy fun drinks and events that they were able to enjoy! I was peeking around the corner watching someone make a Awesome drink/Sorbet that has a lemon in that name  with Nitrous Oxide and our server must of noticed because a few minutes later he sent someone over to make me one as a Birthday gift! it was so fun to watch and really tasted amazing . I was so impressed with our server especially since we weren't the traditional diners ordering tons of items. Once the suckling pig arrived we dug into the Pommes Paillasson and frankly its like a hashbrown with some bacon and I was not a huge fan. It was pretty DRY and I didn't want to waste space in my stomach when the pig was there to be devoured. You do get a large portion of potatoes and it was nicely seasoned. Overall even if we didn't order a huge variety of items we left FAT and HAPPY and I had a amazing birthday dinner. If I make my way back to this restaurant I will be trying the Tar Tar and some of the veggies because I heard people o0o0o and ahhhh over them but once again being in love with a picky eater I didn't try any of it. This place also has Tons and tons of wine options and really cool people to help you with that but I am a beer and hot wings type of girl so I don't have the class or the taste buds to really go for any of that stuff but I did dress up and look the part to be at this restaurant and was treated AMAZING on my special day! so if you have a love for meat, the time and the $ give this place a shot and if you get the chance ask for Elias",

What I didn't know, is that this was going to be by far one of the best dining experiences of my life.   Going through each section of the menu, the waiter was more like a guide than a waiter. The service was spectacular. During our meal, a friend was commenting on how we all didn't receive knives for a particular round of tapas, well, the waiter must have overheard, because just like that, the waiter snuck a knife next to his napkin without my friend even noticing. It was almost as if the knife magically appeared.   On to the food. Below are some of the dishes we got. Nothing disappointed.  Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional  -   4/5  Croquetas de Pollo  -  3/5  Reuben - 5/5  The Classic Tartar - 6/5 (my favorite)  Sloppy Joe - 4/5  Bone In Strip Loin - 5/5  Whole Turbot - 5/5  Wagyu Beef Cheeks - 5/5  Robuchon - 5/5",

What really put it over the top for me was our Somm, she helped select a perfect wine for each section of the tasting menu and pulled real gems for us, top quality at a reasonable price. Wine list is amazing, great selection of Spanish wines from top producers, old vintages and small production unkowns.  Will definitely be going back!",

Outside of the possibility of put on a good show because she told them we were coming, His place is truly FUCKING phenomenal!!!! So for the F bomb adjective but sometimes that is truly the only adjective that works! From the presentation of the dishes to the flavors top notch!  The wagu RibEye was by far the best I have Ever, and I mean Ever tasted. This has perhaps become our new favorite restaurant. Sorry \"Steak\"!  I will add more to this later. Thank you Breanna Armstrong for setting this up, and thank you to my wife for all of it.  In conclusion, if you want your taste buds blow and you have a good appetite, don't waste your money at any other Meat house on this town. Go here!",

We chose Jose's Way which gave us nearly everything I wanted to try. The food is amazing - the cotton candy foie grass is for real. If you saw the video where the woman pretty much melts after tasting it, that will happen to you as well. The table-side beef tartare was impressive. Everything is timed very well and all small delectable bites, so we left full but not uncomfortably so. Service was professional but not particularly warm or friendly. At these prices, it should be impeccable.",

    "text": "A carnivores paradise.  Huge slabs of well aged beef cooked over wood burning grills sit alongside the likes of suckling pig, cured hams and the bounty of the sea.  The playful musings of Jose Andres clear in the molecular gastronomy of many starters.  To begin, do not pass on the giant chicharon.  18\"x24\", crisp and lighter than air with the perfect porky flavor.  Lightly dusted with the spicy chili powder and served with a zesty Greek yogurt. Broken with a hammer tableside this is simply good eats. Other Great starters include the Andres classic cotton candy foie and liquid olives.  Modernist cuisine at its best.  Raw bar selections are outstanding. The live scallops with green peppercorns finally diced onions tomato and spicy togarashi makes the sweetness explode.  The abalone with dashi gelee, soy, lemon, and salmon roe vibrant with great complexity.  The geoduck, like candy from the sea when paired with its yuzu, lemon, finger, soy sauce.  Toothsome and oh so good.  Next up, a fantastic carpaccio. Classically prepared with the light sherry vinegar dressing, shaved Parmesan, and fried capers. Nice texture and good umame.  Tartars, equally good and classic in their preparation. Finally a great selection of cured meats including the Jamon Iberico de Bellota (acorn fed, free ranged, black footed pig). Opt for the chef selection ($60) to try them all.  To the steaks. Do it right and order a rib steak. Understand portions are huge with the typical cut at 2 pounds. Price varies based on the producer ($65 - $98/lb)  All steaks are very well trimmed, properly seared, and cook to temp over a wood burning fire.  The Lindsay Ranch Washugyu is decadently rich and tender with great beef flavor.  Try it along side a True Kobe A5 ribeye.  The A5 Kobe ribeye is a do it yourself, have it your way ordeal. Raw slices are self cooked on an 800 stone and finished with aged soy.  2oz minimum at $45/oz and worth every penny.  Sublime.  Finally the suckling pig. Golden brown and crispy skin on the outside tender and juicy porky goodness on the inside. $160 per quarter that can be easily shared among four as a starter.  Devine.  Great cocktails including Andres' signature gin tonic.  Very well chosen List of wines by the glass and bottle focusing on very high end Spanish producers. There are few bottles below $150, with the average bottle price $450.  Service is very friendly and efficient considering the number of large parties on a typical evening.  Note: don't let its location within the SLS fool you, this is a great restaurant with prices to match.  Expect to spend $300pp with modest alcohol selections.  Outstanding.",

For a restaurant that is at this price point... Below are a few reasons why this place is not a 5 in my opinion.  - We asked for straws and they were handed to me with the busser's barehand.  Yuck!!! I know this is done behind the scene, but I really don't need to see it.  - Table top was so thin that it kept moving - When I am paying $185 per person I expect not to have spots on my utensils. I would like clean and polished silverwares  - Toilet paper was rough - Drink was empty for about 30 minutes and was never removed nor offered another drinks.  -Food was really salty except for the steak, the steak could have used a little more seasoning.   What we like: -Crossed eye Mary was super delicious- perfect, none of the ingredients was overpowering  -Bagels & Lox Cone had the best salmon roe I ever had -Beefsteak tomato- was so innovative and delicious  -The boys enjoyed the Robuchon Potatoes the most- unfortunately the Rib Eye should had been the highlight of our meal.   Will not be back to this location but will try the LA one....maybe.",

Upon being seated, the service remained the same - slow and leisurely. Our drink order alone took over 20 minutes to arrive.   As far as the food goes, the Secreto Iberico de Bellota was phenomenal. A very tender, flavorful cut of pork from Spain. The A5 Kobe was solid, but pricey. Cooked table side on a stone is a nice touch. Lastly, the Wagyu/Black Angus Ribeye was good, but I would order multiple smaller, cheaper cuts if I were to return. It just didn't carry it's weight.  All in all, the food varied from good to excellent, but can't go any higher than 3 stars due to the poor service.",

I recommend this approach if you can because you can try some of the cocktails and appetizers for half the price. We got oysters, chicharron (YUM), this parmesan foam cream puff thing, and 4 drinks for $70 which I feel like is a pretty good deal consider its Vega$.   Once we sat for dinner we were greeted by our server Elias. Elias was great in his recommendations and was thorough in describing all of our options. There are so many amazing choices on the menu -- obviously you can't go wrong with the Wagyu (this is one of 9 restaurants in the U.S. with Japanese Wagyu). We loved the classic steak tartare, and the ribeye tasting as well. The butter potatoes are incredible, but heavy on the butter -- this should be no surprise since the menu literally says \"butter\" three times in the item description.  The standout of the night for me was when we received Jose's Asian Tacos. I had never tried Jamon Iberico but knew it was the ham equivalent of Wagyu. I asked Elias a few questions about it, and he suggested I speak to their in house jamon expert, Freddy. Elias walked us over to the kitchen where there were tons of hams on display ready for slicing. Freddy (jamon expert) explained to us all the nuances of each type of ham, how it was aged, what the pigs ate, qualifications to be jamon iberca, etc. Freddy cut us samples of everything as he was describing it so we had a miniature jamon tasting!   I loved that the kitchen staff were willing to spend time with customers like this, Freddy was in no rush and was happy to just chat about his craft. I thought this was excellent customer service and really was the cherry on top of an already excellent dining experience.",

We looked through the menu & our waiter also spoke to us about his recommendations.   He was very knowledgeable about the menu but he was very pushy about us trying certain items. It kind of seemed like he wanted us to get the pricier dishes. I'm not a huge a fan of beef tartare & the butter potatoes seemed like a boring dish to me but due his persistence at how amazing they were, we decided to order them. To no ones surprise, we did not like those dishes. Bare in mind that for a tartare enthusiast, I'm sure it would be great. But for the potatoes, don't waste your money! They are literally just butter & potatoes & are NOT worth $19. You can make this at home. It's extremely heavy & rich with no freshness or acidity to cut into the fattiness. We also did not receive our order of octopus even though that was something we actually wanted.   That aside, the steak & roasted vegetables we ordered were amazing, as was the overall service of the restaurant. Ultimately, I understand that it was our choice to order everything but I would have really appreciated getting recommendations based on what we told our waiter rather than what was more expensive.",

They also have a large selection of wine and when I say large I mean large there's probably 100 choices? Don't forget to try one of their signature drinks their signature drinks or something that will have not been created her on anyone else's menu. We really enjoyed the fried pork skins! The cotton candy was nice as well although I probably would've preferred it at the end of my meal rather than the beginning as an appetizer. The desserts are good just be prepared that they are very small one bite options. I did leave for but I think next time if I were to return I would order a dish rather than a tasting menu. I was extremely excited to try the suckling pig but when I did for some reason it tasted like the hay they eat.... i'm guessing that this is probably because they are grass fed may be a good quality of meat? I was kind of disappointed because I couldn't bear to swallow it but the steak we had was extremely tender and well worth the visit. The many choices are very creative which allows you to explore different food options so you can come back multiple times and not feel bored. We probably will come back and do some appetizers at the bar the next time we're in town",

    "text": "There are days when I would make reservations to restaurants just based on a picture I saw online. And this place was one of them, the food item that caught my eye was the cotton candy appetizer (not knowing that it was foie gras, which I cannot eat).   We ordered: * Cotton candy mojito * Bagels and lox cone- dill cream cheese, salmon roe * Full blood wagyu- 4 year old, 21 day age dry, full blood  * Tartares- The classic * Potatoes- forgot the name but it came in a cast iron skillet * 2 items from the dessert cart  Little starters were really little, I mean by bite site but the steak was humongous. They come by your table with a carte to mix the steak tartar which I felt gave it the additional star. When it was dessert time we were both stuffed however it was so hard to resist when you see the dessert cart, thus we ordered two piece to try. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience, quite pricey but worth every penny.",

I feel in love with the Grissom wagyu beef carpaccio aka beef on a stick lol. It LITERALLY melts like butter in your mouth. The foie gras wrapped w/ cotton candy is perfect you get sweet & a finishing salty taste that goes well together.  Kobe steak was Delicious, cauliflower steak & Brussel sprouts are you kidding me made just right! Rosemary chicken & buttered potato puree. Please don't forget to try the sulking pig, it's been a wk & I'm still thinking about that dish. Basically if your in Vegas & want a GREAT steak house that is swanky, this is the place.",

So tender and fresh. We had oysters (smoked and raw), Cotten candy foie gras (not a huge foie gras fan, but this was a very good one), beef carpaccio (my kids loved it!), tomato carpaccio (great palate cleanser), and the wagyu!  Delicious. My kid was eating it so slow because she was savoring it (she's 14)!  Great bit sized desserts. There were more!    Service was wonderful. The waiter was so helpful in Explaining everything to us and substituting items.   Place was a little dark for my liking.  It is quite pricey and I wouldn't bring my little kids here.

    "text": "I was at the SLS on a business trip. I've been to Vegas a few times, usuAlly on vacation though. So I was flying solo dining here, which is probably much different than what they typically serve. Fair enough.  To me the mark of a good restaurant is how they treat a single diner. Even when I am in a group I tend to look around and see how the place prioritized a solo patron: do they automatically point the person to the bar to seat, or do they ask? Does the restaurant make sure the single patron is not forgotten -- drinks filled, dishes cleared quickly? If sat at a table, is the person tucked into a corner? Does the wait staff modify the presentation of the specials, since solo diners are not as into the \"meal as show\" idea?  Well, on these points my experience fell flat. I was first offered a seat at a the kitchen bar (not the drink bar) and when I asked for a instead, was placed almost in the last table in the back of this huge restaurant. I was sat at a table with room for four, but was walked by a dozen other open 4-tops in a much luckier area of the restaurant.   I hope you like reading, since I was handed five different menus. Three explaining the fixed price multi-course options, the standard menu, and the huge wine list. The waiter's explanation was it made the menu easier. But with five menus in front of me, I felt like I was studying at a college library.   I ordered the $125 multi course option, so there's lots of small plates with a bite or two coming out. Dirty plates stayed on the table for a long time. Drink glass (no alcohol) stayed empty for really long times (a good 5-7 minutes). Since I was way in the back I was near a back kitchen entrance, probably where the dish and prep areas are, so wait members frequently went by my table without grabbing something dirty off the table.  I'd say the single diner experience here is less than desirable, to be nice.  However, the food is very good. Endive Caesar salad was tasty. The crunchy pork skin, a super light pork-find style poof, is tasty. Tartare slider was quite good too.   The buttered potatoes are decadent and should probably come with a side of Lipitor. Seriously, a scoop on your plate looks like a slab of butter. But they are delicious and have a fantastic rice/potato mill consistency. Chateuabriand was tender but came to me chilly -- another common solo diner challenge as food often sits.   The $120 per person fixed price menu is plenty of food for one person, without a doubt.  Overall the food was well above average. If you're in Vegas with a group, you'd probably like it here. But on a simple business dinner, even with a group? Maybe not so much.",

We picked Bazaar Meat because of the whole suckling pig, which was the perfect special touch we were looking to add to this occasion.   We were also able to pre-order the rest of the meal (a few appetizers and additional sides) by getting in touch with the restaurant ahead of time. I really appreciate this, as it helped us realistically budget for the expensive meal and then made the actual experience seamless.   After sitting down and ordering drinks, we enjoyed dish after dish with amazing table side presentations. Our server and the rest of the service team were impeccable. He gave us good advice and provided a lot of great info about each dish.   We were all really, really impressed with the experience and it was perfect for a special occasion. If you have certain desires or expectations about your evening, I would get in touch ahead of time as everyone was great about answering questions and managing expectations.  THANKS BAZAAR MEAT TEAM!",

    "text": "Atmosphere: 4 Stars  Food: 4.3 Stars Service: 4 Stars   I have been to Bazaar Meat in Vegas for a few times and this place is definitely my preferred one out of the four Jose Andres restaurants in town including e by Jose Andres. I recommend to come here as a group since most of the items are designed for sharing.   The environment is nice and quiet. It is tucked in the corner in the SLS closer to the BLVD entrance.   The services I've received were decent but not memorable.   Some of the things that I've tried:  1. Cotton candy foie gras (4/5): a must order here. It is delicious with sweetness of cotton candy reducing the gamey flavor of the foie gras.   2. The classic tartare (4/5): a tartare that is mixed with caper, mustard and egg yolk that is made by your table.   3. Beef Parmesan grissini (5/5): this is one of my personal favorite here. The carpaccio is so tasty with the breadstick.   4. \"Beefsteak\" tomato (5/5): don't get confused with the name. There's no meat in this tomato tartare. The flavor of balsamic, cucumber, black olive came together so nicely and refreshing.   5. Wagyu beef cheek (3/5): maybe it was a off day for this dish. I didn't enjoy my meat at all and it certainly did not taste wagyu.   6. Catalan spinach (4/5): it was delicious with apple, pine nuts, shallots and raisins.   7. Brussels sprouts (3/5): it was a meh for me. Not seasoned enough.   8. Robuchon potato (4/5): the famous 50/50. It looks like butter and taste like butter. It's very rich so couple spoons was already too much for me. It seems like they changed the name to buttered potato, so they don't have to pay for the name maybe?! Lol.   9. Wagyu/ black angus (5/5): the steak is pricey at $75 per pound. Each steak is about 3 pounds. I think this is good for 4-5 people. We made the mistakes getting two pieces and end up having too much steak left.  The drinks that I have tried here such as Cabernet and Syrah were quite good. The magic mojito is very yummy and pretty. Overall, its a place I would come back. A steak house with many other creative and delicious dishes other than just steaks. A must try!",

    "text": "Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!!! Where do I begin? My dining experiences at most Las Vegas restaurants bearing the name of celebrity chefs have not always been stellar. Emiril, Bobby Flay, Mario Batali to name just a few. It alway seems like they slap their name and then wait to gouge the patrons.  This is one restaurant that bucks that trend. Under the stewardship of Chef Andres, this place is a meat lovers' paradise.  Located in the SLS resort, this is one huge area. Five kitchens, all open to the diners' curious eyes.  The menu is short but filled with goodies that are the product of the chef's creativity and innovation. Some highlights: foie gras, authentic kobe and wagyu as well as carefully sources other cuts.  My dining companion and I remained focused on the red meat (yes it's supposed to be not good for you).  Kobe is offered by the ounce and prepared tableside on a hot stone. We tried each of the three kobe varieties offered and all I can say is we were happy as a clam.  We followed this up with a roughly two pound steak (bone-in). While the Kobe was all about tenderness and marbling, this two pound beast was all about flavor.  For appetizer we ordered a no-protein veggie dish prepared with cactus and other healthy ingredients. Wunderbar!!! To accompany the steak we ordered shishito peppers that complemented the steak perfectly.  Although feeling pretty full by the end of the meal, we decided to order a combination of small desserts which were the icing on the cake.  Service was impeccable and our waiter was forthcoming in providing recommendations.  So any not so good things about this place, you ask.  Well, all I can say is be prepared to take out a second mortgage to dine at this place! All of what I have described does come at a price. But then you get what you pay for.   Sent from my iPhone",

This is new glass of wine but less than I have in my glass of same wine I've been sipping on for an hour\"...my meal consisted of a small bowl of halved cherry tomatoes and their Delmonico potatoes+that 1 glass of 'house' chardonnay-it's dark inside not inviting, nothing like I purposely choose-I love chefs, famous chefs even better, fortunate to have met several through the years-I know this chef is highly acclaimed I am also sure if he was doing the cooking it may have been better-I doubt it would have made a difference- we won't be back-sorry unimpressed-",

    "text": "I finally got to Bazaar Meat this year! I take an annual trip to Vegas because of a work conference. My colleagues and I always seek out the best restaurants in the area. While most experienced Bazaar last year, we had to go back because of Jose Andres. His actions to support workers and the community this past year is just incredible and supporting him by dining at his establishment was the least we could do.   In short: if you are meat lover then this is the place for you. I absolutely recommend it. For steak, it's one of the best I've been to in the country. There seems to be a mix of traditional dishes for the old school steak lover and funky and unique dishes for the more adventurous. I think molecular gastronomy is really neat and love experimenting with unique plates- but after trying quite a number of plates here I would recommend sticking to the more traditional. I found the more experimental plates to be executed a bit lazy- relying on the wow factor presentation to disguise the not very impressive flavors/textures. The most impressive dishes were the simplest. I almost gave it 3 stars bc of my disappointment in the fun dishes- but when you add service and desert anything under 4 stars wouldn't be a fair representation.   The Details:   I'll start with service:  We were a large group. I think we were about 20 people, maybe more. That's a difficult sized table to serve, but they did a truly wonderful job. We all felt attended to, they make alternative plates for folks with allergies/dietary restrictions as communicated that very clearly so everyone felt comfortable and safe (we had 1 shellfish allergy and 2 religious dietary restrictions). Water glasses were always filled. I specified I would only have one glass of wine during the first pour and they remembered to skip me every time when refilling glasses- something I very much appreciated. The servers joked and spoke with all of us individually at some point even though it was clear who our hosts were. I dine in large parties often when at conferences and this was without a doubt the beat service I ever received with a large group.   The Food: Because I was with a very large group being hosted by someone I never got to look at the menu. Our host just ordered a bunch of their favorite dishes. We had a large number of appetizers. The kitchen uses a little molecular gastronomy for some 'wow' factor, but it was their simpler dishes that were best. We had the foie gras s'mores and cotton candy - I love foie gras and with a little sweet added in its divine so I was quite excited for these dishes. The execution wasn't great. I didn't like it as a cold ball under cotton candy at all. The s'mores were okay- but if they would have seared the foie gras I think it would have taken it next level. The tuna tar tar was good, the fried potato sticks (again, I never got a look at the menu to see names of things) were fantastic as were the cheese empanada or 'air bread' thingies with Kobe beef and the real surprise gem for me were the meatballs. Holy Jesus they were the best meatball I ever put in my mouth. It reminded my of my grandmothers right of the frying pan before she'd drop them in the sauce.   For entrees we had two types of steak - I can't remember which ones anymore but they were fantastic. If I had come here and only had the steak I'd have rated them 5 stars. We had to order them medium rare for the table (bc of my party, not restaurant orders) which was a bummer as I prefer rare-blue. The steaks were perfectly prepared if maybe leaning towards rare, yay! They had a perfect sear, perfectly seasoned and was hands down one of the best steaks I've had.   Dessert:  There is an adorable desert cart that you can chose tiny pastries off of.  Our host ordered 2 or 3 of everything so we got quite a sampling. Everything was delicious. The cream puff was filled with the correct type of filling- pastry cream folded into whipped cream, a small thing that I appreciated. The pecan pie cake bite was one of the table favorites, the caramel chocolate resulted in minor scuffles over who got last bites and the caramels with edible wrappers were a lot of fun.",

    "text": "One word... WOW.  And I was beginning to wonder if people didn't know how to cook meat well and simply, letting it shine.  Came here for a later dinner date (~8pm) on a Saturday night since I'm a fan of Jose Andres.  Venue: slightly on the dark side, that we had to bring out our iPhones and use their flashlight.  We were lucky to be put in their more private dining room, which is a lot quieter than the main dining room (and that was pretty loud) but you don't get to see the impressive cuts of meat or the grill (you only see the seafood display).  Decor is \"interesting\" with their taxidermied heads with bling hanging off of them; almost a mix of modern and Wild West style.    Service: ranks on the higher end in terms of quality.  Frequently came by to fill waters and let us know how long to expect food to come out, but not intrusive either.    -- Cotton Candy Foie Gras (Crispy amaranth)($8 each) - one of the more interesting dishes I've ever had period.  Sweet cotton candy contrasting with the super rich, savory foie gras flavor.  Not sure I would order this every single time I visit, but it definitely is one of those dishes you ought to try at least once.  -- Croquetas de Jamon (creamy bechamel filling with jamon de bellota)($14) - one of the best croquettes I've ever had!  Nice crispiness on the outside without being too thick, cheesy enough on the inside without being too overpowering, and enough jamon that you can taste it in the filling (though not quite sure why it has to be served in a shoe-shaped container... kinda weird...)    -- Gazpacho Shots (tomato, cucumber, green bell peppers)($3 each) - if you have slightly heavy, rich appetizers, this is a great palette cleanser to refresh your mouth for your entrees.  Bell peppers added a nice touch to the typical tomato / cucumber gazpacho taste.  -- Catalan Spinach (apple, pine nuts, shallots, raisins)($15) - interesting to pair the spinach with the shallots and raisins since they added a much needed sweetness to the otherwise somewhat bitter spinach.  Kinda wish there were more pine nuts and raisins so you make sure you get one in every bite.  -- 1.5lb Bone-In Magnuson Ribeye ($65/lb) - simple, pure, and just letting the meat shine!  This was on their special menu and is seasoned with just plain salt and pepper.  This is as good as my mom's steak (which is a massive compliment); the meat was cooked really well and we like how we could taste the meat (vs. tasting butter or other sauces / spices thrown on top of meat at other places).  This dish may seem simple / boring, but I would recommend this simple preparation if you really just wanna enjoy meat.  -- Merino Lamb Rack (New Zealand)(oak-wood fired)($60/16 oz.) - wow; again simply prepared, but one of the best rack of lambs we've had in a while (and my date LOVES lamb).  Again, just grilled with salt and pepper, but the lamb flavor shines through.  Definitely to be shared with other people (they give you a full pound of it), but worth trying if you aren't feeling like having cow.  $250 for two people, which isn't the worst damage to our wallets I've ever seen / was totally worth it just for our meats.  We probably went a bit overboard with our meats (bone-in ribeye and lamb) and our veggie choice was on the weaker side, but we left super happy and satisfied (albeit super stuffed and needing to hit the gym).  I don't say this much, but this is probably one of my favorite steak / meat spots of all time!",

Coming to a restaurant like this with this type of reputation I except a certain level of enthusiasm from the servers and it just wasn't there.

They have some items that are best suited for adventurous eaters, but also a lot of mainstream items. My go to's for the sides are the Brussels Sprout salad and mashed potatoes (I'm not exaggerating when I say they're the best I've ever had).   They have a great cocktail list and are always ready to offer suggestions. My boyfriend likes the smoked drinks. Cool presentation.   Save room for at least a bite of dessert. A cute dessert cart comes by with a lot if different options.   This is expensive, but you can choose one of the least expensive steaks and get out without it being outrageous.

Seats were very cozy, like we were eating in someone's lounge. Service was knowledgeable, friendly, attentive and welcoming. The restaurant is a bit off strip but it was a cheap Lyft there and back. Took about 15 minutes.   We really struggled with how to order as two couples with very different tastes and priorities but our server helped us sort it out. I'm glad we had a little extra time to get some of the fun showy / tableside cocktails. A MUST. I also adored the cherry martini which was more of a personal show . Our server also did a little something special for our Anniversary which was really sweet and meant a lot to us.   This is True tapas with 4 kitchens each specializing in something different. The meat selection is unparalleled but they also have fantastic \"meats from the sea\". I also adored the Brussels sprout petals with lemon foam.   This is very much a dining experience so come with an open mind (and an open wallet). Try some of the molecular gastronomy cocktails and don't leave without having at least one foie gras cotton candy appetizers.",

I really wish i had written this review last August when I dined here... first night i came in..they were closed ..we sat at the bar and they were kind enough to offer to cook us up something...not full menu options...but enough to make sure we came back the next night for the full experience.  husband and i did 2 different tasting menu's so we could experience as much as possible... the dining experience was truly magical... there was smoke...and sparkles and i think there may have been unicorns. Every single item that we put in our mouth was divine! service was impeccable ....atmosphere was bustling yet intimate.  i really hope to be able to come back here again soon!",

    "text": "This was a lovely dining experience! The venue itself was stimulating to the eyes and educational. Bazaar is equipped with 4 different kitchens, all specific to the dishes like meats, seafoods, appetizers, and charcuterie.  The staff was really nice and welcoming as we entered. They said it would be fine to walk around and take pictures! They said that's the reason they have an all-open kitchen.   Our server, Chris Rosen, was very knowledgeable in the menu and was able to answer all the questions I had. He made suggestions to us about our menu choices such as the texture of meats, taste, and quantity, which allowed us to make our choices strategically and effectively.   The cotton candy foie gras was innovative. It's a creamy foie gras morsel wrapped in cotton candy. As you put it in your mouth, the cotton candy melts, and it covers the foie with granules of sugar. This gave the foie a nice contrast of textures and flavors.  Gazpacho soup seemed to be a basic item on the menu, but for $3, why wouldn't you add it? After having the foie, it was a nice chaser. The gazpacho was surprisingly pleasant. It's cold tomato soup, but the flavors were delightful on the palate. It also had tiny onions or shallots that gave it a nice crunch.   Chicharron comes in a big sheet, and the runner breaks it for you table-side. It is served with whipped creme fresh and vinegar. It was nice, but nothing too impressive. It reminded me of eating baken-ets and sour cream.   Croquettes de pollo, which I thought was a fancy name for chicken nuggets, was a culinary delight. It's shredded chicken with bechamel, covered with a light crust. Chris described as a tiny chicken pot pie. They were served on a glass chuck.   The Asian tacos were.... interesting? It's Jamon iberico de bellota, which is their prized cut of charcuterie. This charcuterie had been aged for 4 years. They serve this charcuterie A la cart for about $75/oz, but we tried it as an appetizer. To me, it was like a condensed flavor and texture of prosciutto. I just didn't get the combination of seaweed and roe with this item.   Now we come to the belle of the ball - the steaks! We ordered the Voca Vieja tasting and Wagyu black angus. The Voca Vieja is an aged ribeye steak. This one had a much deeper taste in comparison to the wagyu. I enjoyed it more than the wagyu, to be honest. In my opinion, the wagyu was surprisingly dry. However, it could be because I was comparing it to the ribeye.   I paired these two meats with roasted leeks and buttered potatoes puree. I liked the leeks with the meat because it helped cut the fat on the palate. This potato was not your ordinary mashed potatoes. They had a thick, almost chewy, texture to it, and it was very moist!  All in all, it was a great experience, and I would definitely do it again! I think we can request the same servers if you desire for your future dining experience.",

The ambience is very nice as well as a public fire pit/grill was smack dab in the middle. Our party of five decided to try the tasting menu specifically 'Jose's Way'. Everything was absolutely delicious however there are two things to point out.   1) While our waiter was an amazing guy with great knowledge, we did feel a bit rushed with the tapas and didn't have the chance to enjoy them slowly but rather quickly as the next plate immediately would come in   2) While their specialty is meats, the desserts were quite disappointing. It didn't compare to the melt in your mouth steak or to the tapas, and it could be easily bought at a bakery for the same or even BETTER quality.   We had an amazing night and we're definitely eager to go again.  Side note** our table got pretty crowded for a party of five wish we could've had more space",

Me and some friends planned to eat dinner at Katsuya in SLS; however, when we went online to see the hours, we learned it was permanently closed. Then we decided to see what Ummi Burger was about, but it looked too casual to me. When we finally went, we realized it was actually much too casual for what we had in mind. So, we kept walking and ran into Bazaar Meat. We didn't even look at the menu; we just asked to be seated.   The menu confused me a bit at first, but we eventually suspected it was a family style/sharing menu. It is pricey. We wanted a great dinner, but not THAT great. Lol But, we decided to treat ourselves for our last full night in the city. And splitting a shared meal works out okay in the end. Including tip, we spent right around $100 each.   The service was fantastic and we were taken care of by multiple people. The drinks were great, the food was impeccable, and the restaurant's design and style were cool. It was dark, warm, and moody and we sat in a curtained booth.   We shared the lobster, flat iron steak, delmonico potatoes, and grilled asparagus. All were very good. Their desserts are served in small bite sizes and after the main meal, those sizes are a smart idea. I had the key lime tart and jasmine cheesecake.   Look...every meal should be this way. I highly recommend.",

    "text": "What an outstanding meal.  We were lucky enough to be seated in a smaller room next to the kitchen. Others may not dig this but we did. There was also the choice of the long main dining room.  We were on a time constraint and they didn't disappoint. We ordered the tasting, Jose's way and supplemented a few things.  Let's talk about the food. I don't love traditional steakhouses because I get bored with just ordering a steak. This place solved that problem. Our tasting included olives, a salmon tartar appetizer, foie Gras lollipops, cured meats, beefsteak tartare, vegetables, mashed potatoes, ribeye and a flight of five desserts.  Everything was fantastic but there were a few standouts. The first was the iberico ham in the cured meats. Whoa. The small piece just blew my mind. So we asked our waiter if there was anything else we could get with the iberico. He brought us the tacos on seaweed which was both unexpected and satisfying. We also added the A5 tenderloin and kobe, which was prepared chairside. It was prepared perfectly. As a personal preference, I would have liked more salt/seasoning but the meat itself was perfect. He then mentioned the Philly steak airbread and I immediately said yes, since a yelper mentioned that if they had anything with airbread, you should jump on it. Wow they were right. It was filled with a melted Swiss cheese and I can say that besides the iberico, that was my favorite bite.  Dessert was small and just right.  Our service was fantastic, approachable and fun. We had a great time, ate some amazing food, had a great bottle of wine, and I still made my show across town.  I will recommend this place to anyone who wants to listen. This is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

The menu is extensive, with a lot of options, and has a sort of gimmicky essence to some of the dishes that reminds me of Barton G but with food that is much better and less outlandish.   We had the cotton candy foie grois, which was super interesting to eat because of the sweet cotton candy on the outside and the cold, savory foie grois on the inside. We then shared the patatas bravas, the sauce of which resembled the patatas bravas I had over and over again in Spain. Then we had the Setas al Ajillo- savory mushrooms as a side. As a meat, we had the skirt steak which was good but oddly enough, a little colder than room temperature. We even asked them to reheat it, or do something so it would not taste cold, but it came out the same way. A little confusing, but the food was overall good. They also brought out a cute assortment of chocolates for her birthday which was very sweet.   The drinks and service were also very good. Worth a visit.",

We were early so we sat at the bar and ordered a specialty cocktail, I had a Tequila drink serve in a small coupe glass when the bartender asked me how the drink was I remarked it could be colder which resulted in no response whatsoever, a bit weird I must say.  We were escorted soon after to our table where we were seated and began going through one of the most extensive menus I have read in many years!  There was so much detail provided as to each cut of meat available truly mouth watering, we ordered the shrimp and King Crab cocktail which was wonderful! I had the Scallop appetizer it was nice.  Our dinner came the steak which was cooked over a hot wood burning fire was amazing over all, it was a fine meal and I would return.",

The whole suckling pig is a neat oddity to have at least once in your life so if you get the chance you should try it here. However for the most part the pig isn't my favorite...you really need to try all the appetizers and the steaks.   The best dish on the menu IMO are the lamb chops - they're fantastic and you get a TON of them, so good.  The deserts a nice but they're really small and they were out of the one I wanted.

    "text": "There are some fun decor items to look at in this restaurant. I won't ruin the surprise. And you can see all of the meat and the fire cooking fun right when you walk in. So that's fun!   The service was great. Our server provided a lot of interesting details as she described menu items, and she was good at picking up on how much and when we wanted to chat throughout the meal, which is a very tricky skill to master. I was drinking water extremely aggressively, and my glass always had water in it.   We didn't do a tasting menu, which I kind of regret, because we ended up paying around the same for a few la carte options (including a massive steak) as we would have if we chose the tasting menu. We attempted to go with a more traditional American steakhouse approach of potatoes and a huge slab of meat. I think that there are better places if that's what you're into, and you miss some of the most interesting things that this place has to offer otherwise. There are some really creative items on the menu that I wish I could have tried because I'm sure they're delicious. But alas.   The classic tartare was so on point. Sometimes I get this slimy, \"is this going to make me sick?\" vibe from steak tartare. The meat that they use is legit. This was delicious. I definitely recommend getting this.  The Delmonico potatoes are also like crack. I don't know if they brule the top or what is going on. It was like super creamy and cheesy hash brown cut potatoes with this crisp bruled top. That description doesn't do it justice and might not be accurate, but omg, so so good. I would come back here just for the tartare and potatoes.   We ordered a 2.5 lb wagyu/black angus ribeye. It was great. Cooked to perfection. Top quality beef. Rich in flavor. Lovely. But a tad pricey, which I mean, is to be expected, but still. It was pricey. I normally don't talk about price or care that much about it, but for some reason, it was a \"thing\" for me here. The biggest factor leading to it costing too much for me was that a 2.5 lb cut was the smallest size they had when we were there (we had dinner at around 9pm on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend for reference). If we could have gotten a smaller cut, I would have been perfectly satisfied and would have been more OK when the bill came.  I've been to some of the best steakhouses in the country. In Vegas I've also been to Cut a few times. I do prefer this place over Cut. My first experience at Cut a very long time ago was lovely, but when I went again about 1.5 years ago, I just wasn't feeling it. My benchmark that I compare any steak to is Press in St Helena (ignoring all of the fun other tasting menu things and focusing on the steak). The price tag when we go to Press for a similar meal is a few hundred dollars less than it was here, and Press is in Napa where things aren't cheap either.   I would say come here. Definitely make sure you have the tartare and those potatoes. But if you order a 2.5 lb steak, when the bill comes out to $500ish dollars (also includes bottle of wine), think about if it makes more sense to do the tasting menu here (or somewhere else). I feel like for $500, there might be some better options.  So overall I was satisfied. Great meal and service. But I wish I could have paid around $100 less.",

Upon arrival he didn't as of any dietary restrictions, special occasion, etc. nor did he give recommendations or directions on how to best to order until we asked. We had to wait extended periods just to get water. Nothing special or personable about the experience. Foie Gras cotton candy was great (tiny but mighty), and the classic beef tartar was amazing, cocquetas were very tasty but were extremely hot and I ended burning my mouth in them without warning of them being fresh out the fryer.",

My wife told him we were ready with our appetizer order and didn't see him again for 45 minutes.   Cotton candy foie gras is a terrible idea that should never have made it onto any menu.  It's one of those things people pretend to like because they think it makes them sophisticated.  It's gross.  Uni and pork fat tastes like pork fat.  And when you put it on toast, the texture is just toast.  A delicate ingredient like uni needs to be treated carefully.  This was a waste of an expensive ingredient.  Geoduck was okay.  Very small portion.  Not worth the price.  There were two sauces that conflicted.  The cream sauce that goes on the geoduck doesn't go with the yuzu on the side.  Pick a flavor profile.  Overall, a big disappointment.  We arrived excited about the concept of the restaurant because my wife and I both enjoy exotic meats.  But this completely missed the mark.  We left after appetizers so as to not throw good money after bad.",

    "text": "If you like Spanish food, it's just hard to do any better than a Jose Andres restaurant.  This one is more upscale than Jaleo (at the Cosmopolitan) and pricier too, but we were there for Restaurant Week and got a very good deal on the tasting menu.  No, of course it didn't include the $50 per ounce Kobe rib eye, but almost everything in the ten course dinner was excellent.  The notable exception was the Albondigas, which were dry.  I did particularly enjoy the Ajo Blanco Shave Ice (an ice-cold crab salad), and the Coca de Sobresada (sort of a cross between cheese bread and dessert).  For our entree we had the Iberico Pork, which was very flavorful.  The dining room is both elegant and romantic.  The bar area also looked inviting as we passed by.  Service was first rate.  Serving a ten course meal without any delays is a trick in itself, but the wait staff pulled it off and managed to explain the different dishes and answer questions without missing a beat.  So, while this restaurant is a bit more exotic than anything one would have found here back in the days when the Rat Pack was roaming the halls of the old Sahara, I think Frank, Dean and Sammy would have enjoyed eating here, and you probably will too.",

While the national steakhouse (high-end) chains offer great aged Prime beef, wonderful service and deep wine lists, Bazaar goes beyond the beyond and the typical steakhouse dining experience.   The Kobe Air bread - Kobe beef on a flatbread, Classic beef Tartare, Beef and Parmesan Grissini - Carpaccio on a breadstick, and Black Angus Ribeye were incredible.   They have my vote as the best steakhouse restaurant in Vegas for Foodies.   Bonus:  The open kitchens are very engaging for guests.",

They are tiered by size & I suppose quality, according to the server.   She warned me that it takes 45 minutes to cook. What?! A steak?! Whatever. Okay I still want it.   Due to the long wait, we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell. They too were supposed to be the best they offered, kusshis. I usually really like kusshis but these were terrible. They tasted muddy & fishy. I also expected to be served a decent cocktail sauce or mignonette with them, but no. Tasted like it was straight out of a jar and left a bad after taste. The other accompaniment tasted like straight vinegar. I did not complain or say anything. I was just eager for the steak.   An hour later, the steak arrived along with the sides we ordered, buttery whipped potatoes and brussel sprouts.   The steak was ordered medium rare and came out looking like a large piece of leather. It was dry, tough and overcooked.  I did complain at this point. The manger came over and tried to explain the cooking method for the steak. It didn't matter how it was cooked (long, slow smoke) it was terrible. It was hard and dry on the outside and hard rubber inside. I could not even cut it much less chew it! Due to cooking style they could not fix it.   The potatoes were okay but the brussel sprouts were not. They were undercooked and had a raw taste and crunch. I did not mention this to the manager because I didn't want to complain about everything.   He did apologize and comp the $65 steak. Have to give him credit for that.   It was still a very expensive meal for bad oysters, bad brussel sprouts, decent potatoes and wine. Also be aware that the wine list is very expensive, mostly way over $100++ a bottle   I strongly advise to stay away. There are too many good steakhouses in Vegas to waste money and time here!!!",

The lamb chops were also cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was so tender!  No fancy sauces were needed, just a little bit of salt.  Our least favorite were the brussel sprouts.

    "text": "I came to Vegas for my sister's Bachelorette. We decided to try out the SLS hotel's Steakhouse since it was conveniently located at the hotel we were staying at. The waiter was selling us on the $170/person tasting menu where everyone at the table had to agree on ordering, however, not all 10 of us were up for it. So we decided to order several dishes to take a bite out of. His tone of voice changed when we declined the tasting menu, but overall, I was very satisfied with the presentation and taste of all the dishes we ordered:   MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE DISH was the Super-Giant Pork-Skin Chicharron with Greek yogurt and za'atar spices. The slight saltiness of the Chicharron accompanied by the sweetness and spices of the Greek yogurt definitely left my taste buds dancing with joy.   The Salmon roe (a tartar dish) with capers, yuzu, soy sauce, avocado, wasabi and seaweed crackers was also a delicious starter!  For the entree, we shared the following: - Rosewood, TX, Wagyu/Black Angus - Merino Lamb Rack, New Zealand: Oak-wood fired - Grilled Baby Corn with Mayonnaise, chile piquin, popcorn powder - Brussels Sprouts Petals with Apricots, grapes, lemon air (foam) and lemon puree - Setas al Ajillo which are Button mushrooms, garlic, nasturtium - Lucia's Salad which is an Endive Caesar salad, Parmesan, anchovy, air croutons  Drinks I recommend:  - Jose's Gin Tonic: Hendrick's gin served with Fever-Tree tonic, kaffir lime leaf, lemon peel, lime wheel and juniper berries - Magic Mojito: Bacardi Superior rum, mint, lime juice, strained over cotton candy   If we weren't going to a pool party the next day, we would have for sure tried the suckling pig. Everything from the drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts were absolutely divine! I highly recommend this place to anyone. I'm not a big steak lover, but all the other dishes were amazing!",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat is not a conventional Las Vegas steakhouse by whatever standards one would hold a Las Vegas steakhouse to. As is typical of a Jose Andres restaurant, Bazaar Meat combines an irreverent, self-aware, and unconventional menu that features everything from massive slabs of beef and pork, to family-style shared entrees, to old-school wood-fire meat roasts, to $350 caviar flights.   Bazaar Meat is now one of my favorite steakhouses in North America, and can be mentioned in the same breath as my previous top 5: Moishes in Montreal, Cut in L.A., Bern's in Tampa, Luger's in NY, and La Boca in New Orleans. It may take another visit or two, but Bazaar Meat could very well end up at the top of my list.  On my maiden visit, I did the \"Jose's Way\" Tasting ($185), which consisted of:  - Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Crispy amaranth - Ferran Adria Olives, Modern & Traditional: Liquid green olive, gordal olive stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy - Bagel & Lox Cone: With dill cream cheese, salmon roe - Smoke & Ice Fresh Oyster: Applewood-smoked oyster, apple mignonette - The Classic Tartare: Beef sirloin, savora mustard, egg yolk, HP sauce, anchovy on a Parker House roll - Chef's Selection of Cured Meats: Ajo Verde Sausage, Wild Boar Sausage, Mole Oaxaca, Jamon iberico - \"Beefsteak\" Tomato: Tomato confit, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, cucumber, black olive, romaine leaves - Rosewood Texas Rib Eye Wagyu/Black Angus: Spanish-style bone-in rib eye, oak-wood fired - Cauliflower Steak: Pine nuts, preserved lemon - Robuchon Potatoes: Butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes - Grilled Asparagus: Romesco sauce - Dessert Cart: Cream puffs, assorted tarts (e.g. Raspberry Yuzu Tart, Pecan Pie Puff, Coconut Cookie Similar to a Girl Scout Samoa, etc.)  I enjoyed all of it, and especially loved the cured meats, which consisted of some of the best charcuterie you'll eat, the rich and cocoa-tinged Mole Oaxaca being my favorite. The foie gras covered in cotton candy was surprising, but interesting in the best of ways. The tartare was fantastic, and probably sweeter than you will expect it to be.  The highlight, of course, was the 10-ounce Rib Eye, which did not disappoint. The meat comes from Rosewood Ranches, an upper-echelon provider of responsibly-raised American Wagyu that delivers great marbling at a fraction of the cost of Japanese Wagyu. Hitting the tongue, the steak tastes as fragrantly oak-grilled as the fantastic aroma emanating from it, and then releases copious amounts of big, juicy beef flavor upon being chewed.  I was pleased with Bazaar Meat's tributes to other chefs: the quivering liquid olive a la Adria was interesting and well-executed by his understudy. I had Pommes Robuchon two nights earlier at Joel Robuchon in the MGM, and can confirm that Bazaar Meat's version is identical. The \"Beefsteak\" Tomato is virtually the same as Thomas Keller's tomato tartare, which I've had several times before, though buried under frisee.  My only regret was not adding some A5 Kobe Ribeye ($50/ounce) to my meal, as Bazaar Meat is one of only 9 restaurants in the U.S. that import it from Japan. Next time, next time.  There are way too many negative Yelp reviews for this place, mostly from geniuses who booked a reservation at a steakhouse only to order chicken and then complain about the \"lack of flavor.\" To restaurant management: Why even have chicken on your menu? Seriously, you're never going to please those people anyway at your price point.  I think therein lies the biggest challenge for this restaurant: does Bazaar Meat want to be a steakhouse, accessible to diners of all types? Or does it aspire to be something more evolutionary, funky, and forward-thinking? Currently, it is a little of everything -- a steakhouse, a high-end charcuterie room, a tapas bar, an avant-garde \"greatest hits\" menu of sides and appetizers made famous by other chefs (Adria, Robuchon, Keller, etc.), and a suckling pig roast luau.  I love Bazaar Meat for what it is currently, but for this restaurant to thrive long-term at the northern tip of the Las Vegas strip, it may need to narrow its focus and cater to a more specific dining audience.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.7/4.6/4.5",

    "text": "There are giant billboards all over Las Vegas advertising this place as one of the top 5 steakhouses in the US.  As a world-travelling foodie and husband of a chef, I can tell you quite honestly that it isn't even in the top 200. My wife and I had a disappointing anniversary dinner there recently that will be memorable only for how bad it was.    From the vacant-eyed hostesses who have absolutely nothing to say to you as you arrive or depart, to the constantly changing team of stressed looking servers who just throw your plates on the table, incoherently mumble a description of the dish and (literally) run off, the service was anything but what you would expect at a classy, high-priced, fine-dining steakhouse.  It only slightly improved once I expressed my displeasure to a manager.   The food was mediocre and badly overseasoned or underseasoned (mostly over). We ordered the tasting menu, which our main server advertised as a terrific \"showcase\" of chef specialties.  Instead, we got a lot of lazy, gimmicky little courses that were cheap and easy or tasted like they were prepared ahead of time and refrigerated, perhaps for days.  All I could think as they served me one of these dishes, a pork-rind the size of an elephant ear, was \"I'm spending almost $400 for an anniversary dinner and these folks are trying to fill us up with fried pigskin\".  The main attraction, the steak, was \"meh\"...largely flavorless and under seasoned.  The only thing about the entire meal that we enjoyed was the dessert selection...it was excellent.    Save yourself the frustration, disappointment and maybe even a little money and choose any of at least 15 other steakhouses in Las Vegas that are far better than Bazaar Meats for your next special occasion.",

    "text": "WOW. To be honest, I think the food here is too sophisticated for my tongue.  Some of the dishes were so amazingly unique, maybe I just didn't know what I was actually putting in my mouth!  A beautiful restaurant with a huge open kitchen with all the cuts of meat displayed. I felt very blessed to be in this restaurant. As for the food, they actually gave us way more than what is listed for our course menu. I think they gave us 3-4 extra items for us to try. They brought out so much food one by one that by the time the actual beef came out, the entire table could barely eat it. I wish we knew early on how much food was actually coming out before the steak. Then we could have totally paced ourselves a little better instead of trying to finish every single crumb before the next item came out. It didn't help that we were starving when we sat down. And as for the black angus wagyu? Sweet baby Jesus it was good. You can upgrade to a higher quality meat, but the meat we got was amazing. All in all, it was an amazing dining experience. We tasted food that we've never tasted before. But you better warn your credit card company because you're about to make a big purchase.",

The service, the food, the experience, everything was top-notch. The meal was a set menu. From the starter Cotton Candy Foie Gras to the Rosewood Texas Rib Eye Wagyu / Black Angus meat, each dish was mouthwatering. I have a gluten and shellfish allergy, and they had something prepared for for me at each course.  Our servers Adrion Biale and Elias Makridis were outstanding and our busser Victor Gonzales was very helpful..great to work with. We met with the executive Chef and the executive Sous Chef Rhonda Magbitang, who showed us how they did a few things. Pano Arguriades Chris Bugeya, the managers, stopped by to check in on us and Adrion Biale, the lead bartender,  took very good care of us. Erin Bauer helped us set up the event, and it was seamless.  Thanks so much, I will be back, it was outstanding.",

As a twenty-something just starting out in life, some of the prices were a bit out of our range, but we managed to find a few items that were under $45.  The best part is, is that even though the food is expensive, everything is shareable.  Our party consisted of three young women- we ordered two meat dishes (can't remember the names but one was $45 and the other was $38), asparagus (delicious!), the mashed potatoes (yum!), sloppy joe's (so good!), we each had a cotton candy fois gras ( a must try, if not just for the experience), and our own desserts to finish off the meal.   The best part was the cocktails.  All of them are probably delicious based on the three we did try - the Punk Lemonade (16 bucks... same price as a *disgusting* vodka cran at Drais nightclub!), the margarita, and a cotton candy cocktail.  Nick was our server and he was very patient and helpful in picking out items, but more importantly didn't make us feel stupid for being poor and ordering the cheapest things we could find.  I'd go back again a bit more prepared and try the tastings next time!  Our check was around $118 each. I think you have to be willing to spend $150- $250 individually if you want the full experience.",

Pano and the rest of the team at Bazaar Meat need to be recognized for serving my wife and I the best meal we've had in Vegas... ever. We've eaten at SW, Cut, Del Frisco's, Vic and Anthonys and more, and BM was the best. It's hard to say a steakhouse is the best for this or that - well, BM is the best, ALL AROUND.  You must consider (1) price, (2) service, (3) ambience and most importantly (4) the FOOD. But even food is difficult to judge. Did they just make the best steak you've ever had? Or did they make a meal so revolutionary that you not only loved it, but will never forget it?  That is BM. It was not only the best meal we'd had in vegas (and possibly the world) but it was so unique that we'll remember it forever.   I'm not going into the specifics, you'll have to see for yourself.  But I will tell you that my wife and I have been talking about each component, from the appetizers to the main course, every day.   Thank you to all the staff that made our meal amazing. You are miracle workers.    If you're in Vegas and need an amazing place to eat dinner, you MUST MUST try Bazaar Meats!",

I recovered and was able to come home a few hours ago. I had mentioned at least 3 times I was allergic to pine nuts, our waiter had made sure he knew our allergies...  So this made me think it wouldn't be a problem in my meal preparation.  Unfortunately, this was my celebration and dream to enjoy after finishing my first year of teaching public education. I wanted to celebrate, but sadly I spent my time almost dying from lack of oxygen. I'm truly upset my first and last time at Bazaar meats resulted in this outcome. This was not the \"Thank you for reforming public education\" I wanted. Thanks for trying to be the best Bazaar Meats, I just wish instead of asking about allergies you'd also listen. I almost died. My students would have been heartbroken. Try not to almost kill a customer next time. Sadly, my dream dinner resulted in my airways closing. -Christopher Madrill. MadDog710",

I had the opportunity to sit at one of the chef tables facing one of their kitchens, and the gentleman behind the counter could not be more welcoming. He answered all my questions and never steered me wrong. The young lady who was waiting on me, gave me pointers as to what drink I should try, meal options, and dessert. Pano, the manager, checked on me and made sure my expectations were met and exceeded. Of al the restaurants I have dined in this past week, this was best experience I've had where everything was perfect. I will definitely return before the end of trip, and when I return to Vegas I will make sure to visit with the family so that they may enjoy this wonderful place.  I had the Wagyu Hanger Steak which was cooked to the perfect temperature I requested. It was tender and delicious. I also had the buttered potatoes which were amazing, creamy texture and delicious buttery flavor. I had the opportunity to try the Tartar which I had not had before and was also delicious, the bellota ham with its melt in your mouth favor. For dessert I sampled a few and not a bad one in the bunch, my favorite being the White Chocolate raspberry cake and the s'mores inspired one.   Thank you again to everyone, Stephanie, James,  and Pano. You made my evening a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to return and dine with you again. From the food to the desserts but especially the attention to service I could not have had a better experience. I look forward to dining with you again before concluding my trip next week.   Pano, you are an excellent manager and your social media savvy is a plus to any establishment you are in. I look froward to speaking with you again.",

    "text": "I feel like a scoundrel writing a review of a Jose Andres restaurant that is less than five stars, but here goes.    First of all, the SLS hotel in Las Vegas is just weird. It's at the wrong end of the strip, located in the zone of despair surrounded by a half dozen unfinished construction projects and the generally seedy atmosphere of this downscale end of the Strip. Then there's the SLS Hotel itself, which feels unfinished and strange, like a shopping mall that has recently been converted to a casino.  Everything seems temporary. There isn't even a proper ceiling in the casino. (Compare the ceiling here to the phenomenal fabrication of light and glass in the Bellagio and you'll see what I mean). That said, the hotel does have a good selection of restaurants.  The oddly-named \"Bazaar Meat\" is located in the back, so you have to walk through the casino and past a bunch of other restaurants to find it in a kind of no-man's land in the back of the casino with some vacant rooms and a long queue of disused slot machines lined up in the corridor.  It feels like you are walking into a storage facility, not a top notch restaurant.   Once you enter the restaurant, things are a little better.  There are seven kitchens, all devoted to various forms of meat prep, and the waiters are happy to tell you all about it.   Now for the food. Okay, it's Jose Andres, so the quality of everything is excellent.  However, I was not as impressed as I normally would expect to be by a restaurant of this caliber.   We had the roast suckling pig, which honestly left me feeling kind of gross.  It basically consists of ultra crispy leathery skin stuck on top of pillows of bacon-flavored fat.  That's it. Not much \"meat\" here.  Eat it today, wear it tomorrow.   The best thing we ate was the Iberico ham. It is simply the best ham in the world.  Delicious.   Terrific wine list. Good service. We accepted a spanish red at the waiter's suggestion and we loved it so much we kept ordering more.",

The name of this place says it all MEAT. If there is a vegatarian or vegan in your group you may want to skip Bazaar Meat lol. Everything was excellent and  many of the cuts of meat you can order in whatever portion size/weight you want and are priced per ounce. Great specialty drinks and an amazing wine list. It may be considered pricey by some but the quality of the the food and level of service warrants the price tag in my opinion. The only drawback to this place is that it is inside the SLS which is decent but over hyped and WAAAYYYY on the far north end of the strip. I think in the long run the location will hurt this place.

We sat at the meat bar (like a sushi bar) and there was a really loud group right next to us.  I think the chefs felt bad and offered us a complimentary sample of the Asian Taco, chorizo and another meat (not sure exactly what it was, but it was similar to prosciutto) All 3 were delicious and greatly appreciated.    We wanted to try to tasting menu, but I don't think I would have been able to eat all of it, so we opted to start with the Classic Tartare.  OMG, we are still talking about it.  It was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  It was a very generous portion and I wish I had about 10 more of them.  They mix it all table side and all of the flavors compliment each other so well.The rolls that came with it were a perfect accompaniment.  The only thing that I am sad about is that I don't know the next time I'd be able to make it to Vegas to have it again.    For our entrees we had the rack of lamb and wagyu skirt steak.  Both were cooked to perfection.  The lamb was seasoned perfectly and had such great flavor.  The steak was served over a rosemary mustard sauce that was delicious.  We also got the cauliflower steak, it was good, but not great.  I wish we would have gotten the Robuchon potatoes, they sound amazing.    All in all, I am so glad we decided to try this place.  There are so many places to choose from in Vegas it can become overwhelming to decide when you're only there for a few days.  I would come back to Bazaar Meat in a second the next time I come to Vegas.",

If you've been to the Bazaar in LA, you might be thrown off a bit at first glance of the menu, but don't fret, it's still definitely all meant to be shared (or not if you come very hungry with a definite craving for a certain type of meat).  From colonial murals to crocodile heads with jewelry, the decor is pretty SLS with the exception of mouth savoring meats on display across the 5 separate kitchen across the floor.  What they produce is mouth watering success.  What we had: Cotton candy foie gras, Asian tacos, suckling pig sandwiches, 2lbs of the Harris ranch and mini corn.  Everything was amazing and we're all dying to go back for the whole suckling pig with a larger group.  The cotton candy foie gras is a great combination and awesome starter.  Asian tacos is Europe meets Asia and equally great.  The suckling pig sandwich is one of the larger appetizers but wow!  So juicy!  The steak was perfect and we all loved the shaved salt, or whatever it was, seasoning encrusting a perfectly cooked slab of meat.  And if you love corn, you have to try the mini corn with mayo and popcorn powder.  Out of this world!  Bazaar meet doesn't stop there though.  The service is second to none, and our server, Tony, was spectacular and knocked the evening out of this park.  If you can sit in his section, you won't be disappointed.  We can't wait to be back!",

I would Iike to point out to anyone on yelp that it's ok to not be into a dish and to yelp about it, even if everyone else seems to like it. This is what the Internet is all about. This was actually my second time to Bazaar and I'm still not into it. Am I a bad person for this? Perhaps. But am I entitled to my own opinion. Hell, yes I am!  My original review that upset the manager:   \"Salty blahness. Although I'm not a huge fan of Spanish/Catalan food, this didn't particularly elevate it. In general, if you serve me foie gras on a stick, I'm gonna pissed. Your cotton candy silliness around a little tiny bit of foie gras is an insult to those tiny lives that died for delishiousness.   Hype. Hype. Hype.   Best part is the music.\"  I still stand by that review and no manager can help me change my mind.  I'm just not into your restaurant. Sorry.   PS: staff was nice.",

    "text": "I've been to the Bazzar and was not particularly impressed. Tiny portions, trying too hard, all show and no substance.   That is why, when I came to Vegas recently and started hearing good things about Bazzar meat, I didn't have the highest hopes.  I was staying at the SLS though, so figured I might as well give it a shot.  The first dish came, the foiette. It was okay.   Then the grilled octopus, which was delicious. One look at our dish and our neighbors proceeded to add it to their order too.  Next the Bison Buffalo Style, which was a lot of fun to DIY and innovatively tasty.  Then came the Waygu skirt steak. I was expecting a tiny piece of meat, but it was actually reasonably sized. The meat just melts in your mouth yet doesn't feel super fatty. One of the best steaks I've ever had, and without breaking the wallet!  Oh yes and the white truffle honey drink is really good! Sweet and truffly and bubbly, but not syrupy or artificial tasting.  And the dessert tarts are all delicious too.   And the decor there is really cool, hanging whole pigs included.  I'm getting hungry writing this. Moral of the story, come to Bazaar Meat! It IS still fancy and artsy fartsy like its Los Angeles counterpart, but has way more substance when it comes to the food.",

    "text": "Service: We've been here twice now and service has been shotty both times. The first time was when the restaurant first opened so perhaps they just had some kinks to work out. We had made reservations and the place was pretty empty when we showed up (we're old and like to have dinner earlier). The hostess stuck us in a weird side table next to the back room. We asked the server to be moved to a different table as it sounded like there was a private event going on in the room since it was pretty noisy.  He did not seem pleased at all and it took a while to get moved (you know, the restaurant was soo busy and all..)  The new server was not as knowledgable about the menu as we would have liked. He had to get back to us about some questions.   We went again recently and service doesn't seem to have improved much. Not only was the server not knowledgable like the first, the timing of our food was weird. Some things came out too quickly, and our main took way too long (so long, in fact, the server came and apologized twice). Let's get these people some more training, shall we??  Food: This place should be renamed to Bazaar Dessert instead. We had the $25 platter both times and every single piece was delicious. Can't rave enough about the desserts. We would come here just for that.  The oysters are delicious (both times), just make sure to ask for no pepper on them, unless you like it like that. The lamb neck, mushroom, and cauliflower vegetable sides are amazing.   Surprisingly, for a meat place, the red stuff isn't that great. The Kobe isn't anything special (the best we've had was at Providence in LA). We had the Mishima ribeye and one would think it would taste amazing. It is a $100+ piece of meat, after all.  Sadly, it lacked flavor. The cocktails and Iberco Jamon are nothing special, save your money and get them elsewhere.   Overall, don't expect to be WOWed, and expect to spend more than what the stuff is actually worth. But do try the desserts, and it is still an interesting experience (menu/restaurant concept).",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice since grand opening (oysters, smoked oysters, chataeubriand, ribeye, suckling pig, asparagus, roasted corn, wild boar sausage, au gratin potatoes, etc.) Here's the bottom line, the food is good but not great ESPECIALLY for the price ($150-200 / pp for 2-3 pieces of 2.5 lbs of ribeye between 6) and the service is very lacking. I will give you that it's the first week of operation but come on, you don't bring the entree literally 20 minutes before the sides and you don't replace some of the party's silverware and plate ware and not the other halfs.  I will go again in a few months to see if things have improved but until then it's honestly 2 stars compared to it's competition.   My bonafides: I've also eaten at most of the major steak places in Vegas as well as across the country. I've also eaten at Robuchon with Robuchon cooking for our table, Guy Savoy, Latalaier, Alex, Le Cirque, E', etc etc etc.  UPDATE: I took Yassine, the GM, up on his offer for another meal for my friend's deployment going away party. The service was very good which is what you would expect if the GM is arranging your res and he kindly comped some of the meal. The chef sent out some apps: cotton candy, croquettes, chicharron, and we ordered the tartare. Shared the strip steak and pork loin for entrees with a variety of sides. Food again was hit or miss with the pork loin, for example, being very dry and while everyone was very nice, still had some service mishaps with the sides coming out well after the entrees, for example. I gave them another star (understanding that the GM personally invited us back) but they still have a ways to go to compete with others at their price point along the strip. I haven't totally written them off, though.",

    "text": "A confession: I planned a trip to Vegas just so I could try this restaurant. I mean, it wasn't too big of a stretch because I love Vegas, hadn't been yet in 2014, and it's not that long of a drive. However, my love of Jose Andres goes that deep (I mean, as a chef. You know.) So, yeah, I might be a little biased, but this was nothing short of fantastic.  We made a reservation for 9pm on a Monday and when we got there had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated because they were running behind. No big deal: new restaurant, I'm in no hurry. My husband and I got a couple of drinks and took in the sights. Soon after, it was time to be seated.  Now, I love steak, but I didn't come here to eat a big slab of cow. I came here to get a lot of different flavors, so that's what we did. After having our server crack open a nice bottle of Verdejo, we started with the cotton candy foie gras. I'll admit it: I was a little skeptical. Sometimes people seem to like the sweet and savory mixture better than me. But I'd heard so many good things I had to try it, and when I popped it into my mouth it was pure amazingness. (That's what she said?)   Next on the hit parade: a suckling pig sandwich. This was much larger than  expected. (That's what she said...again?) Well flavored pork, a bit of mustard, and some truly wonderful bread: I'd love to have this for lunch every day. The buffalo-style bison carpaccio quickly followed, which was a really nice experience. One of those dishes where you really get the flavors in sections when you take a bite: first some wonderfully fresh bison, followed by the wonderful bite of blue cheese, with some great celery flavor at the end. From the description I was expecting something a bit spicier, but this was very good nonetheless.  Given how much Jose talks about his love of vegetables, we had to get a few while we were here. The piquillo peppers \"confit\" came out first. This was a deceptively simple presentation that really brought out the wonderful taste of the peppers. The highlight of the vegetables, though, were the roasted leeks that came out next. Perfect flavor with a hint of chipotle in the sauce. I've had dreams about these in the time since our trip.  The overall highlight of the meal, though, came out next: the tortilla sacromonte. When I first started reading the description I was like, \"Omelet? Ehh...\" but then I saw kidneys, sweatbreads, and bone marrow and I was like, \"SOLD!\" And it did the opposite of disappoint. Such wonderful rich flavors brought together by the egg (and the raw one on top, even!) I could have gotten a whole other order and I'm not sure it would have been enough.   And finally, our little dessert was the foie gras smores, because my husband is a bit of a smores fanatic. The fattyness of the foie gras, the delicious slightly melted marshmallow. It was (should I say it?) astonishing! A wonderful way to end the meal.  Was it expensive? Of course it was. Was it worth every penny? Absolutely. Do I want to go again right now? Definitely.",

    "text": "1 - The drinks: Manhattan was delicious. Served with an ice sphere (no cube). Gf had the Leatherette. It was smoky, flavorful, and strong. One of the tastiest cocktails I've imbibed.   2 - The foie gras wrapped in cotton candy: what???? That's a thing??? Single bite. Experience of flavors you don't expect. Sensory explosion. Delicious doesn't adequately describe the experience.   3 - Chefs selection meat plate - fresh, and you can really taste the meat. The pig tastes like pig, not pig and chemicals. It also tastes like acorn, peanuts, or whatever the animal was fed during its life. We thank it for allowing us to eat it.   4 - classic tartare: slightly acidic (in a great way) absurdly tender, and the perfect consistency (I hate watery tartar!). Served with \"Parker Rolls\" that are without question the most yummy rolls I've ever tasted with my mouth parts. Tiny, salty, buttery balls of goodness. Pro-tip: Make sandwiches with the tartar and rolls!  5 - suckling pig sandwich: sizable portion. Carmelized onions, crisp pig skin with tender meat, buttery flakey delicious panini-style bread. Our favorite dish of the night.   6 - skirt steak: tasty, well cooked, whole grain mustard. Not \"outstanding,\" but still very very good.  7 - butter butter butter potatoes: essentially mashed potatoes (but don't call them that) that are incredibly creamy and well-seasoned. Oh so good.   8 - FORGOT: the chicken croquettes!!! These little buggers were terrific. Chicken and bechamel. Inside a fried croquette shell. And served in a LUCITE SNEAKER. Might be just me, but I think it tasted better that way...  Very pricey. I suppose I have to dock a star for that, right?",

We love small plates, sharing, and steak, so a tapas restaurant that serves large slabs of steak (2.5+lbs) for the table to share is perfect.  Instead of 4 people hovering over their own 16 oz steak, we can get 2 large steaks, cooked to perfection and carved for the table to share, along with 6 variations of potatoes (we loved the crispy straw potatoes), mexican mini corns, brussel sprout leaf, smoked raw oysters, delectable mini samdwiches, and so much more.  If you don't like small plates, sharing, steak, or large slabs of meat, then it will be difficult to enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres has a summer tasting menu with fewer items than their three normal tasting menus.  This was my chance to give Bazaar a try.  I was seated at a long bar that has two sushi style refrigerated cabinets and I was able to watch two of the chefs cut very thin slices from the Iberico ham and make steak tartare.  I was soon brought the iced tea I ordered and it was refilled several times during my time there.    I was given the three tasting menus and the huge regular menu.  I already knew I wanted the summer tasting menu and I asked my server, Edward, about it.  He was going to retrieve one for me but I knew that was what I wanted so he merely took my order afgter asking how I wanted my chateaubriand cooked and if I had any food allergies.  The first thing brought to me was the giant pork skin chicharron in some white butcher paper.  After seeing the huge piece of chicharron, the person took a mallet and whacked the pork skin so it was broken into more manageable pieces to eat.  It was served with Greek yogurt that was almost foamy and both the pork rind and the yogurt were dusted with za'atar spices.  It was very good.  Next up was a trip of small bites--a bagel and lox cone, a liquid green olive, and an olive stuffed with piquillo pepper and anchovy.  The cone was made was made from bagel dough and was filled with cream cheese and topped with salmon row.  The olives were both good but the stuffed one was the best.  Next up were 6 croquetas de jamon, small fried balls stuffed with bechamel with Iberico ham.  These were excellent.  There was a lot of bechamel flavoring but the ham flavor was not quite there.  The next item was an Italian grissini--a long breadstick--that was wrapped with very thinly sliced beef and served with a caramelized onion puree.  Really good.  Then the chateaubriand was brought.  The hot plate was put on a raised wooden platform and the server put two of the slices on my plate and spooned perigord sauce over the pieces.  There was also a folded napkin filled with pomme souffle.  These were puffed potatoes like 4D potato chips.  The steak was seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of salt and pepper. Along with all of this was a serving of Robuchon potatoes which the menu describes as \"butter, butter, more butter, some potatoes.  It was creamy and delightful!!  Still one more accompaniment to the main course was some grilled asparagus on Romesco sauce.  After this, I was brought three small desserts--a lemon meringue tart, a chocolate cream puff, and a chocolate bon bon.    Almost everything was very good but I'd subtract some for the deserts.  There's nothing creative there.  These type of small tarts and cream puffs are what you'd find on a higher end buffet line and was so out of character with the rest of the meal.  Service was excellent.  Edward refilled my iced tea often and was always around for anything I might need.  One thing of note, as I was watching the one cook making steak tartare, he would put a small tasting fork into the mixture and check the flavor and then tossed the fork.  I told him if he wanted a third party, neutral taster, I'd volunteer.  Just after my dessert was brought, he handed over the counter a steak tartar slider with a raw quail egg.  A really nice gesture and a perfect ending to a fun and flavorful meal.  This gave me a chance to try some of Bazaar's food in smaller portions.  I recommend trying the summer tasting menu.",

We made reservations for 7:00 on a Friday night and that seemed to be on the early side for the rest of the diners. The restaurant wasn't very busy when we arrived, but became more lively as we enjoyed our meal.  The timing and the show of all of the courses was what made this such a spectacular date night spot. Most of the tables had booths so couples could sit together for a cozy meal. My husband and I don't normally sit on the same side, but literally every table was doing it so he caved. Every item brought to us was a show, from the drinks to the appetizers to the meats. The staff did a great job of making the arrival of each dish and drink interesting.   Both of our drinks were spot on. It was one of those times where the cost of the drink was justified in the taste. I had a smoky Bourbon drink that was amazing. It was heavy on the smoky flavor and was strong enough to satisfy my Bourbon craving. The aroma was amazing too. My husband had a Mojito that was also delicious and prepared in a fun way table side.   The food! Wow! Everything was amazing with fun presentations to match. Cotton Candy Foie Gras- it's meant to be enjoyed as one bite, loved the texture of the foie gras and the sweetness of the cotton candy Pork Skin Chicharron- huge portion that is hammered into smaller pieces table side, deliciously salty Gazpacho Shots- loved the spicy flavor and all of the flavors in general Croquetas de Pollo- yummy, but not the best item on the menu Butifarra Spiral Sausage- my husband and I both thought this was one of, if not the best sausages we'd ever had. The bread and honey aioli served with this were tasty. Loved that they sliced this at the table. Skirt Steak- yum! Tender, well seasoned, and loved the mustard served on the plate Robuchon Potatoes- this packed all the butter that the menu promised, so deliciously rich Setas al Ajillo- even a mushroom hater would love these, loved the crust and the flavor Desserts- six different desserts that were all delicious and amounted to a very generous portion. The jelly with the edible wrapper was tasty and unique. My favorite items were the raspberry tart and cream puff.  The service was attentive, but not obtrusive. Our waiter and his assistant checked in constantly and efficiently cleared away finished plates. They really added to the experience in the way they presented all of the dishes. The menu is extensive and our waiter was well versed in every detail. He spent a nice amount of time explaining everything to us, but not in a pushy manner.   I left stunned that this restaurant isn't talked about more. I've been missing out and will definitely be back again. The dishes are so unique that I could see returning and having a fresh experience each time.",

    "text": "This meal was definitely in my top 10 dining experiences!  We had a drink in the bar before we sat down. Drinks were good, and bar staff was okay. Not over the top friendly, but they got us our drinks so that's always a plus.   Dinner was great. With a group our size we didn't know where to start with the menu so opted for a tasting menu. I'm certainly glad we did. The food kept coming, and everything was good. I can't remember everything we had, but the highlights: Cotton Candy Foie Gras- yum! Chicken Croquetas - delicious! The green olives -I could have done without. They weren't bad, just not my thing. The Classic Tartare- Amazing Pork Skins- surprising good (I was skeptical) The Potato Puree and the asparagus was also good, but the cauliflower was my favorite!  Tenderloin- was cooked to perfection  Desserts were mini tartlets and chocolates and a great way to end an amazing meal.  There were also a few other items we tried that I don't completely remember, but I can honestly say from presentation to taste- it was spectacular!  Our service was good, I wouldn't say over the top though, however, the manager did stop by a few times and also gave us a tour which was super nice and unexpected.   I hope this place is still around the next time I'm in Vegas because I would love to come back!",

The taster rib eye was disappointing in flavor and tenderness, it was a bit tough for wagyu beef. great ambiance, service and food quality.",

Last night we decided to try Happy Hour at the bar as you can still order off the main menu, or the Happy Hour Menu.  Happy Hour prices these are NOT!  The Happy Hour menu consists of items that are still priced at the restaurant prices.  I had two Margaritas, thought they would be Happy Hour prices, NOPE.  Still $18 a piece, my wife's Cosmopolitans were $16 a piece.  Why bother having a Happy Hour if you are still going to charge regular prices. If and when we go back to Bazaar Meat it will be for dinner in the restaurant. Really not impressed.  I will say that the bartenders were exceptional!",

    "text": "I don't know where to even begin. It was such a great meal, I want to go back already. I've been to the Bazaar in LA once and that was also amazing, so I knew I had to check out Bazaar Meat when in Vegas.  We made reservations for 5:30pm (time they open) for 12 people. We were seated right away at a long table. Since everything is served tapas style, we split the group in half to make sharing easier.  Pitcher of Sangria to share - Refreshing and light. The 6 of us each got about 2 full glasses. I wish I was able to try one of their more innovative cocktails, but I shall save that for next time.  Starters: Reuben - This is very similar to the Philly Cheese Steak in LA. Each order comes with one \"air bread\" filled with cheese and meat on top. Unfortunately, I liked the Philly Cheese Steak more. The swiss cheese in the Reuben was a bit overpowering.  Beef & Parmesan Grissini - 5 long breadsticks with beef carpaccio wrapped around. Served with a delicious parmesan sauce. This cheese wasn't too overpowering. It complemented the bread and meat very well.  Classic Tartare - Served tableside, which was awesome. I was drooling while they were making it. Very well seasoned and quite acidic, maybe from the mustard or sauce? We made tiny sandwiches with the cute parker rolls and it was perfect.   Entree:  Blood Sausage with Uni - Only dish I didn't really like since I'm not a fan of blood sausage. So although this is the best blood sausage I've had, that's really not saying much. I ate the uni separately since its delicate taste gets totally lost if you eat it together.  Wagyu / Angus Rib Steak - HUGE portion. And so it should be as this was pretty pricey. They price by ounce but a lot of the weight comes from the inedible bone. There are two different cuts, and I wasn't sure which was which. One was cooked medium rare and was very juicy and flavorful. The other was cooked more well done and was a bit tough to cut through.  Sides: Robuchon Potatoes - Soooo heavenly. Their description is literally \"butter, butter, some potatoes, and more butter.\" Can't go wrong with that! The texture was silky smooth too. I slathered the potatoes like sauce all over the steak and it made it that much better.  \"Dessert\": Foieffle - Comes with 2. A puffy waffle that when cut into, melted goodness of foie oozes out. It's a mix of sweet and savory. The peanut butter and honey gives it a sticky texture, but its sweetness balances out the fattiness of the foie. The waffle itself is light and crispy.     Foie Gras S'mores - My favorite dish saved for last! Also a play on sweet and savory which I'm realizing is probably the best way to enjoy foie. Comes with 4. The foie, chocolate, and marshmallow are sandwiched in between thin, crisp graham crackers. Yum!  Service was good, as expected from a high-end restaurant. Our waiter was a little snooty but he was very attentive and tried to suggest items based on our likes and dislikes. Our bill came out to around $120 per person, inclusive of tax and service, which I thought was very reasonable. Will definitely be back, not only to try new items, but to also order the same ones again!",

    "text": "I have wanted to dine at Bazaar Meat since before SLS opened! Well, Hubby and I were celebrating our 8 year anniversary and I decided it was time to take the plunge. We easily valeted at SLS and made our way to the players club to redeem a $30 dining credit for my birthday.   We were a tad late for our reservation, but I had called to confirm we were still coming. After being greeted by the hostess and who I presume was a manager we waited a few moments then we're told to follow the hostess. Right before walking off the gentleman, who I think was a manager, whispered something to the hostess about our table facing something. We were led through the dining room and past all the kitchens. Our table was a half booth/half table facing the closed, empty side of the dining room, to be fair had we chose to sit in the chairs instead of the comfy booths we would have faced the action.   Our server greeted us soon after sitting down, he went over the menu with us and let us know what the specials were. It took my husband and I a little while to figure out our plan of attack. We decided to pick a few starters- Passion Up cocktail LN2 Don't Be A Lemon! Cotton Candy Foie Gras Rueben THE Foieffle  We wanted to try multiple things vs. ordering one large Ribeye so we decided on- Merino Rack Of Lamb Chauteaubriand  Street Corn Delmonico Potatoes Setas al Aljillo   I ordered the Passion Up and it was AMAZING, I could have taken a bath in that passion fruit foam! The drink itself was a great balance of tart, sweet, and strong. The LN2 is meant as a palate cleanser, it's prepared table side using lots of liquid nitrogen. I loved the texture of it, \"the best sorbet I've ever tasted\" were the words I said. I used it as a pallette cleanser through the whole meal.   Onto food! I wish I had an endless supply of all 3 starters we chose. They were that phenomenal!!! The Cotton Candy was a great balance of salty/savory. We tried the Rueben next, the salty swiss was a perfect balance for the sauerkraut. Finally THE Foieffle. This crispy Belgian style waffle was full of this peanut butter foie mixture that I could have eatin forever.   Our lamb arrived first, prepared perfectly medium as asked, followed by the potatoes. Perfect pace to take pictures. As I started serving the lamb the rest of our order followed. Perfect timing. Every morsel I put in my mouth was amazing. I highly recommend just ordering exactly what we ordered. Maybe throw in the Iberico Ham, it's the only item I regret not ordering. After we finished my husband asked me my favorite, the lamb stoke the show for me. And THE Foieffle. But really I would order every single item over again.   Now to service. Somewhere between bite checking and when we fished eating, our server disappeared. I had bottled sparkling water but my husband had iced water. We sat finished for a little bit before an assistant offered to clear plates, we asked him for water. We sat a little while longer before I noticed a different server peek around to our out of the way booth. He brought over dessert menus. Then a dessert platter of an array of petite fours. We decided on the 10 piece chef selection of desserts. When our box arrived it was beautiful, but only contained 9 pieces. We stopped a waitress (not ours) to ask about it. She took care of it right away and we were given a chocolate as our 10th piece. Our new server then brought an 11th piece, a creme puff, for our anniversary. My husband's water sat empty through the entirety of dessert.  After such a tasty and down right joyous meal I feel like the ball had been dropped. We were given up by a server who never cared to stop and say bye. We were shoved off on to a server who never cared to introduce his self. From years in the industry it felt like we were being judged as a \"who cares\" table, maybe because we're young, or maybe we weren't dressed to the 9's. But from the manager sticking us in that awful table in the beginning to not one, but 2 servers, ignoring us I needed to take that 5th star away. When you're spending $300 (before tip) on a meal that tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD, service should make that meal BETTER. Not leave a sour taste in my mouth.   My PC is down, written on my phone. Sorry for errors.",

What we ordered:  Giant chicharron- literally a giant square that they break apart table side. The Greek yogurt dipping sauce added a nice flavor.  Reuben sandwich- the bread was air puffed with cheese inside. Amazing.   Croquettes- filled with ham, cheese, and onion. It was alright, cheese had a strong acidic taste for me.  Classic tartare-made table side, with just the right amount of heat. I ended up finishing the ample portion when my two table mates tapped out.  Paella pasta with squid and pork- the pan had good crust so the vermicelli had a good crunch to it while the top was soft and flavorful.  Double cut pork chop (1 1/4 lb) - the quince sauce had amazing caramelization, light pink throughout.   Robuchon potatoes-tasted like I was eating a stick of butter dipped in mashed potatoes. Sinfully good.   We didn't make it to the desert menu but they also had a wide variety of choices with multiple flavors of each choice such as cakes, tarts, cookies, cream puffs, candies, etc.   Our server Adrion was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave honest suggestions. Kept up with our drinks, which is a noble feat considering we drink fast and use lemons and limes with each drink.",

I had just returned from Spain on vacation and enjoyed paella, tapas and iberico pork and was looking forward to dining here.  I stayed here at the SLS so it couldn't have been more convenient to dine here. The restaurant is swanky and perfect for a buisness meeting or date out. Once checking in, I was seated immediately at the meat bar - which is equivalent to a sushi bar but had views of hanging iberico pork legs and other cured meats.  To get in the mood, I ordered a glass of red wine from Spain and selected the Lardys Madrid soup that contained a quail egg- soup was yummy. For my main entree, I selected the the lamb neck served with fried oysters and potatoes. I ordered sides of Catalan spinach and Delmonico potatoes.  Everything was delish except there was so much food I have no room for dessert! My waiter was spot on with service and very polished.  When I departed I saw the charcoal grill and could feel the heat coming off it to sear meats - I definitely have a reason to go back soon!",

    "text": "What a pretentious, annoying place. Went with a large party and were basically told we all HAD to order the same food and that you weren't allowed to just order whatever YOU wanted to eat individually. Everything was obnoxiously justified with painfully boring explanations about the chefs vision of a multi kitchen logistical nightmare.  Servers were pushy and snobby, food was absurdly salty and portions are stupidly small. Also what we had was not amazing innovative stuff, pretty normal stuff with a slight (mostly unimpressive twist). Perhaps croquetas and chicharron are groundbreaking to some Vegas tourists?  It may help to say I have eaten at MANY a fantastic Michelin rated restaurant. In many countries. I am not giving a bad review because I do not \"get it\" or appreciate fine dining. I just had a lousy experience here.  Getting one of the tasting menus is a horrid idea as you will get one thimble sized portion of everything per person vs six little bs thimbles if you just ordered off the menu.   The only redeeming factor was the fact that the meat from the $100 classic tasting menu was really good.   Literally I'd say skip this place, but if you must, do NOT go with more than two people, do not go hungry, know that you will spend $100-$150 no matter what you do, and honestly just pick three things eat them and ignore the idiotic instructions on not ordering a la carte and not sharing.",

We even got the upgraded steak that was $75 more a person. When the steaks arrived, the girl didnt even know which steak is which. Thinking we got the right ones, we started eating. Not having ordered this steak before, i didnt know what to expect. It was just ok. Was not worth the extra $75. Our waitress came by 10 minutes later and checked up on us. She saw the steaks and it was the other way around. So now we were half way thru the steaks and we had the wrong ones! Waitress switched the plates but the meat was almost gone at this point. Our original steak was cooked medium well instead of medium rare so we didnt enjoy it at all. At this point it was too late to exchange or return the steaks since they were almost gone anyway.  Bottom line is, if you are a steak restaurant PLEASE KNOW YOUR STEAKS. We came here because of good reviews but we didnt really enjoy our overcooked steak.",

Ridiculously complicated menu, complicated more by waiters wasting time bragging to customers about the Chef and pushing crazy priced steaks and wines. $150 per person dinners in Vegas is OK for us, but this place is a ripoff - just a bad experience for us and friends who had exact same experience on 4 separate occasions.",

    "text": "Latest visit was absolutely AMAZING! No surprise here with the genius chef, and the admiration of my life Jose Andres.   Came here to celebrate dude's bday. After a long day of partying and baking in the sun, we were famished. The hostess was very sweet and seated us right away. Our server John was super nice, very authentic and most importantly extremely knowledgeable about food, ingredients, where they came from, origins. Now, I'm not a foodie, I am a food lover and a food nerd. I love to hear about how the dishes are made, where the ingredients came from, and all the nerdy facts. Throughout the meal, John explained everything to us, and patiently answered all my nerdy questions.   We started off with the signature cotton candy foie gras, i've had a million times and love it every single time. Next up was the Super Giant Pork Skin Chicheroins, with a special greek yogurt dip mixed with extra virgin olive oil. I confess, I've traveled the world and ate lots of olives but Spanish olives and olive oil still holds a special place in my heart, and that small dash was just the right amount to activate the tastebuds. Next was the Smoke and Ice Fresh Oysters, Jose is a skilled magician with molecular gastronomy, and the oysters was topped with a foam full of flavors and ingredients. The Gazpacho was a simple, popular dish, but as always there's a twist, the soup still retained the old familiar taste but with an extra little something that makes you wonder what was THAT?    Now onto the raw meat stuff for this little cani-hoard, yours truly. The Classic Tartare was made with top quality cut, mixed in a bowl right in front of you with a raw egg and very few simple but top quality seasoning, garnished with eatable pretty flowers. The carpaccio was beautifully presented topped with capers and aged cheese. Of course, a perfect Spanish meal is not complete without the world famous Jamon Iberico, flown in from Spain. For those of us that are lucky enough to taste it in our lives, it's truly better than crack! This stuff is hard to get in the US, and I was very happy I got to have it here. Mix that with the Lucia's Salad 2 beautifully perfect pieces of Endive leaves with cheese and garnish, and I can tell my mom I ate some veggies. lol.   This place isn't called Bazaar meat for nothing, we got the ribeye with a side of mushrooms. The ribeye was truly a very quality cut and the meat was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. The mushrooms were no ordinary mushrooms either, definitely some magic mushrooms. To truly comprehend Jose's molecular gastronomy skills, we ordered one of the frozen cocktails, where a bowl containing several liquid mixture is stirred while liquid nitrogen is poured it making a very tasty but potent concoction that will truly \"knock your senses out\". Enjoy this while eating the variety of freshly made dessert bites in house, and I thought I had died and went to heaven: foodie heaven.   Dude and I absolutely loved our meal, everything was wonderful and I highly recommend one of the chef's selection coursed menus!",

    "text": "Jose Andres makes food that fascinates and delivers via unusual methods. This guy is the king of \"molecular gastronomy\" - which we have had the pleasure of trying at both The Bazaar in Beverly Hills and 'e (that's right, just e') the private dining experience at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. Both 5 star experiences also. There is a price that comes with this - but you will likely not have a more memorable gastronomical experience than at a Jose' Andres establishment, this I can say with great enthusiasm!   I am truly a more visual and tactile individual and my words could never provide any justice to my actual experience! We have enjoyed all Jose Andres restaurants and tasting menus for different reasons. This location has amazing decor, cures it's own \"meat\" as in the name! Has a pseudo hunting decor in the middle of the Vegas strip (makes sense...meat again)!    When we arrived, we were offered a seat in the private dining room which is known as the Silver Room (it has been passed on that this was an original control room for the roller coaster that was part of the former Sahara) - it is a stunning room and we are sure we would have been treated in grand style...however, we chose to eat at the counter, where we could watch the chef's in action. We also knew Jose Andres was in town during this period to work set up solar cooking at a music and culinary festival. We had no such luck of seeing him on this evening!   Since Jose Andres is known for working with liquid nitrogen...we wanted to start the evening off right, with a cocktail called the, LN2 Don't Be a Lemon. It is made table side of liquid nitrogen. Then our evening got off as a tasting menu of various meats and I will let my photos do the talking...  It was all pure love...",

They offer various types of tapas with a very confusing menu.  By confusing I mean just way too much information like you're reading a book!  Please condense it!  Lots of meat choices and if you're willing to splurge you can even order yourself a full blown pig.  We ordered a taste flight menu for $65 which lets you sample various items and includes a dessert at the end.  All of the items were good and impressive presentation.  However for the prices I felt the portions were extremely small.  Ambience is very over the top, the liquid nitrogen infused lemon drink was really good, but it didn't give me the \"wow\" factor.  It's one of those places you saw, you conquered and then left.  I really didn't understand how a party of eight isn't allowed to order whatever they choose?!  There was complications with the chef and the fact our parties had to order all the same thing?  Despite the reasoning for the explanation I really just can't comprehend the mentality of it.  Regardless, nice place, but I don't know if I'd come back.",

The pacing felt right though dishes filled the table at a couple of points. Two of us spent about two and a half hours eating which seemed perfect.  The real standout was our server and the staff supporting him. There wasn't a dish that was brought to the table where he wasn't immediately present explaining ingredients and why the dish was special. It added to the enjoyment of the meal tremendously. He also told us about the restaurant and went into detail about food and kitchen with pride. Empty plates were cleared quickly and settings were reset regularly. On one occasion a support person tried to clear an unfinished dish I was still enjoying.   The atmosphere is unmatched with five open theater kitchens to provide entertainment during an occasional lull in the conversation. The smell of wood smoke filled the air adding to the already exquisite ambience.  Be prepared to spend top dollar at Bazaar Meat but not to regret spending a single one. We loved it.",

And the Liquid Nitrogen Cocktail was actually better in Vegas.  The Beef Carpaccio, Cotten Candy Foie Gras and I can't remember what it was called but the succulent pig sandwich was amazing.  The most delicious thing I've probably ever had was the Jose Asian Tacos, served straight from god's serving tray. I was told why the meat was the best there is but I forgot. They're tiny but worth the splurge.   There were also these small little carmel tarts that were phenomenal!     The service was spot on and our waiter, John, was very attentive.

    "text": "Experience:  A friend told me about a summer tasting menu they were offering for only $65, and I knew this was my chance to not only taste many things on the menu, but actually afford it. We made a reservation for a Thursday night at 7pm.  Facility:  Located inside SLS, it was very beautiful with an upscale feel, but in typical Vegas style, you see people show up in jeans and super casual clothes. I guess they just don't want to turn away tourists. LOL!   Service:  the service was good, but not the best I ever had. This was a 10 course meal that there were periods of lull with no food, then only 1-2 minutes between courses, almost serving them on top of each other. The waiters were nice enough, but I had to flag down for refills on water and drinks.   Food:  This tasting menu was a lot of fun. It started out with pork skins that were delicious.  They were fairly light and thin for pork skins. Seems they were seasoned with just the right amount of salt and pepper. These were a big hit with the whole table.   Next we had a two way olive entree...one way stuffed with anchovies and served in a \"anchovy\" tin....and the other was a faux olive that was on a spoon. It held the shape of an olive, but once you bit into it, it was almost liquified and had the essence of olive. Bazaar, but unique. LOL! Anyway, neither of these were my fav, but still neat to try.  They served a row and caviar cone next. It was pretty good. The cone was crisp and filled with a cream cheese type filling which was perfect to balance the salty sea flavor of the fish.  The croquettes were round and crispy outside with a creamy mixture inside. They were decent. We had a young girl with our group who really liked these, as they were pretty \"normal\" for her palate.  The beef carpaccio on a breadstick was my favorite. The beef was delicious and tender and melted in my mouth. Meat is something they definitely do well here.  The asparagus, potatoes and main meat course we're all good. The mashed potatoes were made with half potato and half butter...who wouldn't love that!  The meat was so good, but of course by this time I'm getting pretty full. LOL!  They served these strange potatoes that looked like zepplolis...a rectangle shape, but the strange part is they were fried crisp and completely hollow in the middle. So it was almost like a potato chip  Oh my...won't be finishing the details on the food. Waited too long to finish, and now I forgot some of it. LOL!  Overall:  I'm so glad they had this tasting menu special. It makes the menu on a very expensive place more affordable to the broke folks. It was very tasty too!!",

    "text": "Great steakhouse in Vegas, albeit way out there on the outskirts of the Strip at the SLS.  The decor is less than perfect, but the food is solid.  Had both a ribeye and skirt steak here, and they were perfectly cooked.  Although it took over an hour for the ribeye.  The outside was nicely charred without being burnt, and the inside was a perfect medium rare.  The best appetizer and side here for me is hands down the fresh tomato and bread.    The worst side you can order here is the \"cauliflower steak.\"  It tastes nothing like steak at all, but mushy cauliflower.  The wine list is also pretty good here, about 2x-2.5x retail prices.  Do the Spanish wines, as you are in a Spanish inspired restaurant, and they have some terrific bottles.",

You have to be a little adventurous and try some of their appetizers. Some I love, others have been a little too odd for my taste. We've dined here with friends from Spain and they've loved it as well! On the date 12/17 we made the mistake of bringing a friend that doesn't eat red meat. We assumed there would be enough seafood dishes to keep her happy, however all their seafood dishes are more of cold appetizers than entrees and this really upset her. I approached our  server and asked him if it were possible to have a seafood bowl brought over from the Chinese restaurant in the casino. I offered to give him my card to pay for it. I was so amazed, not only did he make it happen for my friend but he also said his manager covered the cost for us! Thank you so much to Elias (our server) for saving the dinner! Will be returning here for sure and asking for Elias in the future!",

I don't even like gin and tonics but our server told me to try it. It was amazing and my new favorite drink (only will order at bazaar meats). Everything on the menu is excellent! Yes it is pricy but I would rather spend my money here then any other restaurant on the strip. Some of my favorites: croquetas de Jamon (trust me it is an explosion of goodness in your mouth), Reuben, if you like tartares you will love the classic beef tartare, sides robuchon and baby corn were soooo good! All the meat is great but we finished it off with something sweet the foieffle! We were stuffed but found away to eat it Since it was so good! Enjoy yourself it will be an experience to remember!",

    "text": "Bazaar Meat is the ultimate carnivorous experience in life and is yet another reason why Chef Jose Andres is one of my favorite chefs.  It requires a bit of effort to get to, being in the newly-opened SLS on the north side of the Vegas Strip, but it's well worth every bit.  What you lose in time getting there is repaid tenfold with the experience that you gain.  The restaurant is open and spacious to showcase the expansive kitchen and the expanding stomachs that fill the seats.  The bar, which is separated from the restaurant, is a perfect place to sit and enjoy some well-crafted cocktails while one is waiting in anticipation of the pending feast.    The cocktails are a solid A- at Bazaar Meat.  I started off with a mezcal old fashion (a drink that has perhaps replaced the classic old fashion temporarily), and it was spot on.    Then the meal.   We had an adventurous group and adventure, we did.  We started off with the foie gras cotton candy; a skewered block of foie gras that is wrapped in cotton candy, creating a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  It seemed rude not to get the chef's selection of cured meats, given the setting, so we took that on.  The choice was a great one, especially considering Jose was able to secure the elusive Jamon Iberico.  Then there was the Sloppy Joe made with beef bolognese - get it.  We decided that the Suckling Pig was a must and it definitely turned out to be.  Don't ask questions and just order it.  We decided we should also be a little healthy, so we ordered the chicken; it comes with heavily-buttered mash potatoes to make it even more amazing.  Needless to say, everyone left full and happy.    Come prepared to spend $100-150 on dinner.",

While the staff did make accommodations for my dietary restrictions (THANK YOU), the raw meat in my face at every turn was a bit too much for my tastes.  I do greatly appreciate the fact that they brought out separate dishes for me that were vegetarian options of what the group was eating but having a tomato \"tartare\" dish next to bloody beef tartare is NOT appetizing. It freaked me out.",

    "text": "One star is too much for this place. I say zero stars!!  Let me begin by saying that I am an avid restaurant goer and have had my share of bad experiences. Read my other reviews. I have been disappointed in several occasions. However few are comparable to my visit to Bazaar.  Let me also say the meat in Bazaar Vegas is objectively good (although good can also be found in Outback Steakhouse for 5x less).  Having said this, my review can be broken down into several themes: - Overpriced : everything here is 1.5x to 2x your traditional high end restaurant headline price. This approaches Michelin level prices while delivering miles below the Michelin experience. Any wine by the glass will start by setting you back almost twenty bucks (we are talking Spanish wine people, pre tax pre tip. The type you can buy bottles worth seven to eight bucks will be sold to you for at least 10x that price). - Fake: I have seen some peoples review mentioning the cotton candy tapa (cotton candy wrapped micro bite of low quality sugar crusted foie) and the olives (olive infused spheres). These have been written by people who have never had foie or good olives clearly. There is nothing authentic about the poor foie, the sphere is demode and you should get this as a free appetizer (of which there were none for the record), and I dare not mention the lack of authenticity that the tortilla, morcilla, or even the pre frozen croquetas exuded (the latter reminded me of the stuff you buy in big frozen bags back home in Spain). - Tiny portions: The whole \"tapas\" thing is a scam. Portions are just tiny. The waiters will do their best to try to sell you a Spanish tapas experience and you will end up having to order 2x what you typically would or end up hungry. At some stage I just started ordering twice the original amount and still ended up hungry. - Brash: waiters are running from one place to another with little regard for personal touch. At a restaurant like this, this would have been for me the obvious redeeming factor. Waitress was late, plates came with no logical order. Two of the orders were simply forgotten. Big fail. - Oversized: this place is huge and empty. About two thirds of the tables are unused. Huge corridors and empty areas make you feel this place was built for scale, and not for the individualized experience. I realize this may sound trivial, but the picky eater with high standards who makes his way here will be shocked by the disproportionately large size of the place that conveys a Cheesecake Factory feel to set foot into an unfortunate series of disappointing events.  All in all I wish I had made a generous donation to a noble charity proposition, and will probably do, to clean my conscience off this terrible experience.  You've been warned!!",
