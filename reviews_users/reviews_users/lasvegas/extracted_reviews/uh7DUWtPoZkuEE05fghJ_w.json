The reason for the four star instead of a five is we were seated next to the waiter station, and did not have much room to feel comfortable. As soon as we would start to talk or relax my husband would have to move out of the way as a waitress or waiter came to add something to the computer grab a rag or what not. We did make reservations, however did not know to state that we wanted to sit away from that area. I suggest if you are going there to make Make it very clear you want a roomie table that is not in a pathway.",

    "text": "AMAZING!! Went here for a friend's bachelorette one night and the food was incredible!! The menu is served family style where each item is served with a serving per person. At first the servings seem small... but the food comes out over time rather than all together. It makes trying the food, drinking, and enjoying company that much better!!  The decor was beautiful! You enter through a hidden door in a pawn shop and are instantly in an older era! I loved the frame wall with lockets hanging from the frames and the different mirrors along the walls. I'd recommend this place. Just be aware that the walk through the hotel seemed pretty long and it did get noisy while we were there. When we walked in it was loud but it became normal and we could talk/hear each other.",

I can honestly say everything about the experience was amazing!  Loved the speak easy feel and the vibe of the place. The server recommended ordering around 5-6 small plates for the two of us to share. We decided to go with the tuna poke, the roasted bone marrow, the grilled cheese and tomato dumplings, the thin crust goat cheese pizzetta, k-town bao burgers. Our server also recommended an amazing Pinot Noir that seemed to be the crowd favorite for the majority of the tables there. Beauty and Essex was definitely worth the wait, and I would absolutely recommend a visit to anyone visiting Vegas!",

It's a classy atmosphere, you'll wish you dressed up fancy but casual attire is welcome.  The menu is on the pricey side, think big plates, tiny portions. One of us ordered the ceviche thinking it'd be shareable among the 5 of us, but it's literally 3 mini tortilla cup shells. However, it did taste delicious! We also ordered the Short Rib Mac & Cheese, and a Kale & Apple salad, both have a good plate/portion ratio. There was way too much bread crumb toppings on the mac & cheese which made it really dry, but I mean, it was pretty good if you avoid it and get the macs at the bottom where all the sauce was. The salad was really light and refreshing, and was a good balance since the mac & cheese was so heavy.   We didn't order any desserts either, but it sounded pretty good; there's one named after Kygo! (I'm assuming). We didn't order any drinks either, but they all looked interesting! There was even a \"Virgin Cocktail's\" menu, which I thought was cool that they try to to cater to all ages.",

I'm really glad we ended up here because the speakeasy theme was really fun and the ambiance was awesome. I particularly liked the room where the wall was made of picture frames and necklaces. I think this place is worth it just for the decor and experience honestly. Now on to the food: Ceaser toast- this was okay, nothing I would order again. Bao sliders- meat was very juicy, buns were delicious. Cavatelli with sausage- very flavorful and a decent sized portion. Street corn ravioli- so so good. Takes your tastebuds straight to Mexico!  Tomato soup with grilled cheese dumplings- different kind of flavor, smoky and complex. Was good but not my favorite. Chicken meatballs- the most delicious part of the night. They come in this brown mushroom sauce and have a big ball of ricotta on top, these were to die for. And the sauce so flavorful, so decedent I basically licked the bowl.",

From best to worst:  =======Recommend======= * Tomahawk - $125 and not as big as you'd think but exceptionally delicious (surprising from a tapas place!). Didn't even need to use any of the sauces it came with. * Short rib mac n cheese: Definitely worth getting, perfectly creamy, cheesy and meaty. * Butterscotch Pot de creme: Solid! Super creamy, luscious creamy whipped cream perfectly balanced with the butterscotch parts. I ate the whole thing by myself * Scallops: Loved these perfectly seared, perfectly seasoned scallops sitting on a bed of delicious charred corn. Could've eaten 3 on my own.  =======Good======= * Grilled Cheese Dumplings: Interesting! Basically a cheese-tomato sauce concoction in a spoon. Recommend ordering for the table. * French onion soup dumplings: Not delicate like a XLB nor did it really taste like a dumpling, but fun to share. I love french onion and saw the resemblance. Not super impressed but though it was interesting. * Cauliflower: Standard but tasty side dish * Chicken Meatballs: A little too mushy for me. Nice truffle flavor though. =======Pass======= * Pulled Chicken Arepas: I'm hard to impress when it comes to arepas, and the flavors just didn't do it for me. Kind of blah tasting.  * Avocado Toast: Generous avocado, too much bread.  * Strawberry shortcake cheesecake bars: Cool concept, and I love strawberry but I just didn't like this cheesecake because the cheesecake bar was too hard yet not soft enough. Didn't enjoy the cheesescake flavor and I also don't like cap n crunch. =======Do Not Order======= * Caesar Salad Toast: Love caesar, love toast, didn't love this. Too creamy and not as crunchy as I'd expect. * Chile Relleno Empanadas: 4 tiny empanadas. Tasted kind of healthy and not in a good way. * Garganelli: I love the concept of this dish but it tasted atrocious. Like worse than Lean Cuisine.",

You're captured by the overall decor, the hosts, and thank goodness the food.   We went big, and ordered one to two of everything off of the menu. It added up in a big way, but our gang of 8 were hungry, and not interested in having a just a bite to eat.   Everything. Yes everything was delicious, and I'll do this place every time I'm in town -- all though lotus of Siam will always trump anywhere in my mind.   Lastly, be picky with where you are seated. Don't have them hide you somewhere in the back. They usually do that with the Hee Haw crowd who've zero style and don't fit in the look or feel of the restaurant. If you're wearing construction boots, white high heel pumps, sweat stains, denim jeans that you keep pulling up in spite of a fabric belt, then go somewhere else.",

Very cool vibe and just like in NYC you walk through a functioning pawn shop to get to the restaurant. We had a group of 4 and they recommend 1-2 plates per person in tapas style portions. We opted for the Pearls of the Sea which was great and included all the chilled items from the Raw Bar including Oysters, Clams, Lobster, Crab, and Shrimp. Next we got the Sea Bass tacos, Tuna Sashimi tacos, Lamb, and Scallops. We loved the Scallops and Lamb, and the tacos were delicious, but leave you craving more for the cost. Broccolini was also excellent and a good portion for 4-5 people. Lastly the drinks were superb. The woodsman is a great starter beverage and the muddled pear makes it stand out. Great experience and though it's loud in there, the ambiance speaks for itself.",

Doesn't seem like much, and then you enter into this beautiful lavish 20's style restaurant covered in chandeliers and a dining room enclosed through hung lockets.   They offer a wide range of tapas style dishes. Everything from oysters, to individual soup dumplings, to personal size strawberry shortcake bars and depending on your party size they custom order the amount so everyone gets their own (I just love that!)   Beauty and Essex also does a partner server style. We had two servers for our table which made it easier to order cocktails faster and explain the dishes as they were coming out-the restaurant was super super busy (Ana and Apolo were both so knowledgeable and picked out some of their favorite dishes for us to try)    Bottom line.....If your looking for a quiet romantic dinner skip this place, BUT if your going with a group of people and want some amazing cocktails and funky food options book Beauty and Essex! And request Ana and Apolo!!   Favs:  --walnut kale salad (and I hate kale!! It was so good!!!) --tomato soup dumplings --yellowtail sashimi --lobster roll (super tiny! But delish) --French onion soup dumplings  --strawberry shortcake ice cream bars (just like your childhood remembers them)  Wouldn't order again: --avacado toast (order the chicken caeser instead)  --empanadas-just eh.....just basically fried dough   My only complaint is beauty and Essex doesn't have a huge liquor selection. It's crazy to me that such a huge restaurant doesn't carry Kettle One, Grey Goose, or Don Julio",

Place is dimly lit and had a nice vibe to it.  Kinda hard to explain.  Music and ambient noise wasn't too loud. Great place for  small or large dinner.  Restrooms were really clean. Service:  Pretty great throughout.  We had servers just bring out food and she did a great job of picking out dishes that highlighted the menu.  This was the first time we had made that type of request and we weren't disappointed.  Water was constantly being refilled. Food:  Tapas (small plate) style so we got to try a lot of items.  Bone marrow was really good.  I could eat that all day.  I really liked their take on the grilled cheese with the smoked bacon.  It was a bite sized portion and I was planning on ordering another one.  But then the other items came out...The Bao burgers were also pretty good.  I have had similar ones elsewhere so it didn't really stand out.  The chorizo mac n' cheese was amazing.  Blend of creamy yet savory.  The chicken meatballs were interesting.  I have never had chicken meatballs.  But it worked.  I would order that again. However, our favorite was the deep fried Thai style shrimp.  IT was lightly battered, yet perfectly fried.  I have never had such a well cooked shrimp.  It was paired really nicely with a thai sauce.  We loved it so much we had to order a second one.  The most disappointing dish was the Filet.  NOthing special.  I would have rather had more of the small plates.  Overall, a great dining experience.  Food was good and service was as well.",

Some recommendations: the lamb chops, fried shrimp, chicken meatballs, soup dumplings. You can't really go wrong, though. Everything was great. Highly recommended.",

Lobster Mac & Cheese  I wish it was less expensive so I could go more often. Nevertheless, I'm excited to visit the location in NYC.",

They got us in early, even on a Saturday night.  Yellowtail sashimi. $19. The most amazing Ponzu sauce, I would definitely recommend  Bone marrow on toast. $19. This was my first time having bone marrow and it was delicious, would recommend as well.  grilled cheese dumplings and tomato soup. Around $20, I don't remember the exact price. Would not recommend. While they were tasty, they were just little pieces of fried cheese with some tomato soup.  Emerald gimlet drink. $17. I am obsessed with this drink! Basil basil basil!!!  Burger and fries. $19. Really good, huge slice of feta on the burger and side of BBQ fries that taste like lays BBQ chips.   This restaurant is very cute and a must try if you are in town.",

We also had the tomato dumplings which was good, but the best meal was the tacos, OMG delish. Service was good, venue too loud as others had mentioned. Overall experience was ehhh.

The menu is very modern so don't be fooled by the names in the reviews.  For example, the grilled cheese and tomato soup comes out in bite size spoons but is crazy delicious.  if you are looking for the traditional meal, this may not be your place but the food was creative, fun, and delicious.  You are paying for it because the prices are a little high but to be expected with this kind of food. The drink menu is a little obnoxiously priced but the bartenders are very good.",

I don't intend on waiting for 30 minutes to get seated. Once we got seated, it took forever to get anyone's attention. The server took forever to take our orders and the food also took forever to come out.   I understand that most people come here to have drinks for dinner, but my girls and I were pretty hung over, so we opted out from the drinks. I think the server was pretty annoyed of us for not ordering any alcohol and that is what mainly racks up the bill. So once our food came out, he literally handed us the bill 30 mins after and we weren't even finished eating.   The bone marrow, Kobe burger and salad were pretty good, but the chicken meatball was pretty gross...   Overall, the experience was whatever. Maybe if we had ordered drinks, it would've been a better experience. There are definitely better upscale restaurants in Vegas, so I definitely will not be coming back and I'll take my money elsewhere.",

Bill with tip $150.  You are in Vegas. At a celebrity restaurant, it's worth it to me.  We had the tuna tacos which were my favorite.  Short rib mac and cheese. Yum. Lobster roll was fantastic.  Caesar toast was different but my least fav.  The seared tuna was heavy on the pepper crust if you like it.  The quality was right on. And the grilled cheese and bacon tomato soup spoons hit the spot.  Recommends if you can appreciate it.",

    "text": "I was prepared to give this restaurant 5 full stars but service quality lacked a little for this fun, finer dining establishment and a $250 bill.  Beauty and Essex initially has you intrigued by it's memorable entrance. You initially think its a store front full of vintage guitars, swanky watches and other pieces of jewelry and art you see through the looking glass but on the left side of the store front is a big blue door. Look for that, it's the restaurants entrance.   Once inside, your ears are filled with music including Will Smith's sensual serenade \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It.\" You immediately know you're in for a good time, who doesn't love a good 90's throwback? We checked in at the host stand for our reservation and were promptly seated. We passed a large bar full of patrons sitting and standing drinking fun colored libations in vintage style glasses, sharing conversations and enjoying their sips. We were seated in the back, which to my conclusion is the nosiest room. Tucked in at a two top table wedged in-between two other two tops and larger parties of 10, 15 and 8 we were seated. I will say I was not happy with this table as I could barely hear my partner and we were talking at an extremely loud level all night. \"I think the salmon looks great\" \" Yeah, the steak looks great.\" \"No, I said the food is great.\" \"What?\" If you are looking for a romantic table for two or planning on bringing your elderly grandparents, I would suggest another place. This restaurant is for cool kids, food connoisseurs and those of us with excellent hearing.  We were greeted pretty quickly by our server and placed a cocktail order. Once that happened, we waited... and waited... and waited.   A solid fifteen minutes later our server came back around apologizing, took our food order and then within two minutes quickly brought back those cocktails we had ordered. I have to say, the mixologist knows what they are doing, and I commend their craft. The Woodsman drink tastes like Autumn in a cup, or in comparison a burly man chopping wood maybe. Notes of allspice, muddled pear and Bourbon make this an easy to sip man made cocktail. I also ordered the Garnet Gimlet and despite this being a virgin cocktail it did not disappoint. The muddled strawberry and mint were fresh and the bruleed lemon was a nice garnish.   The mood seemed to be set for an irritable dining experience after initial delays with our service but then the first of our food arrived, the yellowtail sashimi. You know that experience you have when you take a bite of food and time suddenly slows down and the room becomes quite while you slowly savor a dish? That's what this plate is. An experience. The yellowtail is cut into perfectly thin strips and is as fresh as a fisherman's market can be. Topped with pickled jalapeno that gives you a bit of a crunchy texture and served with an apple ponzu sauce you want to drink. The tartness of the apples plays so well on this sweet delicate fish. This was my favorite dish and for good reason.   We also ordered the Chile Relleno Empanadas, Grilled Cheese Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Short Rib Mac & Cheese, the dry-aged sirloin and topped our dining experience off with the black bottomed butterscotch pot de creme.   The grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings is my other choice for favorite dishes. The perfect bite of nostalgia brought together on one spoon. The Sirloin was also delicious, cooked to a perfect medium, fully covered in black peppercorns and served with a clove of roasted garlic. The steak is accompanied with three sauces, the spicy red chimichurri being my favorite.   Chris Santos and his team take you on a round the world journey at Beauty and Essex and the food here is truly memorable. I would recommend this place for locals and tourists a like, larger parties and smaller friends gatherings but I don't think it's a place to take your grandmother unless she is cooler than you.   All in all Beauty and Essex was a great meal and I hope to return for better service.",

The atmosphere is great from the dim lighting, numerous chandeliers and out of the ordinary lighting fixtures you are mesmerized by each rooms decor. The beauty of rich gem tones adorn each room and the front room with those deep velvet purples are so inviting. The cocktail  list is fun I love when these types of places have mixologist that know what their doing and create the best  selection for you. My favorite is the ODB (Old Dirty Bramble) yummy a great twist on a tequila cocktail! Food is divine their small plates are scrumptious my fav's are the Grill Cheese Dumplings the Mac & Cheese and the Avocado Toast perfect size portions very rich in flavor and spot on with presentation. Dessert.... yeah of course can skip this there so make room lol! \"NYC\" Doughnuts are so yummy served nice and warm I love the caramel sauce, then the Black Bottomed Butterscotch with Coconut Cream ahhhhhhh pure heaven  I honestly could keep going on about this place! So if you are looking for a trendy atmosphere with a rich vintage look, exceptional food & cocktails and not a huge dent in your wallet (remember it's at the Cosmo) then you must try!",

Inside it was swanky and dimly lit, with a bunch of picture frames that make up a wall that look like mirrors but aren't; entering this place has almost a speakeasy feel since there's a mock storefront on the outside.  I was surprised at the level of pep our friendly server had in describing all of the options to us, helping to explain what might make sense for us to order based on how hungry we were.  My wife and wound up trying 4-5 plates to share, and were pleased with them all.  The shrimp plate and corn & scallops were favorites of ours (also was a bonus that the shrimp could be ordered gluten free and still have the crunchy coating).  The salmon ceviche was very fresh and had good spice.  I can tell from some of the snooty reviewers on here that the four star average overall for the restaurant should tell you enough - worth a look if you're at or near the Cosmo.",

One appetizer portion is 6 pieces, meant to be shared - I ate them all since I was dining solo. No regrets. For my entree I had the elote style scallops which were outstanding. I loved the flavor combination with the corn, chipotle spice and tender scallops. I would recommend this restaurant to chill in their lounge or at their bar solo or with a group of up to 4, or an intimate dinner for 2. The dining room gets extremely loud, so I would not recommend this for a large group of 4 or more as you wouldn't be able to hear each other.",

Our server was attentive and all the staff was walking around clearing plates and refilling water quickly. Even the manager came over to ask how our experience was!  Not only was the service amazing so was the food. Make sure you try the toasts and the seared tuna!  I will be dreaming about Beauty & Essex such an amazing experience!!!!",

We ordered a nice bottle of wine and many dishes to share between the two of us. I really like tapa style restaurants since you get to taste many different dishes and flavors. The food was delicious! I had an overall good experience the only reason it's not a 5 star review is that even thought it was mentioned on our reservation and my husband reminded them of my birthday that night they didn't acknowledged it at all   It's not a cheap restaurant so I thought it was very tacky on their part. I guess if you have any special occasion don't count on them helping you celebrate it...",

They have a dj there which is a fun touch. Our server was great, but the busboys seemed to slack a little bit. They were standing around talking to each other when there were plates to be cleared. We enjoyed all our food, but the grilled cheese dumplings were the bomb!  I don't even like tomato soup :). There was one thing I wasn't happy with. We wanted to share a steak, but I like medium well and my boyfriend likes medium rare. They said they serve it sliced so we asked if it could be served at different temps and they said no. It doesn't make sense that a few pieces couldn't be put back on and cooked longer.",

I chose the spot because the interior design looked awesome, and it definitely did not disappoint! The vibe is very cool although it's a bit dark. All of the food was very delicious. It is tapas style though which I didn't know beforehand. The pricing was decent if you're willing to spend some money (about $75-80 per person). I highly recommend the tomato soup and grilled cheese thing!!",

They were busy, and B&E has a nice vibe to it. \"Zack\" was our waiter and took awesome care of us. For apps, we split the Thai Shrimp and the Ahi Wonton Tacos. Both were excellent. The tacos were extremely fresh and flavorful, but definitely on the extreme petite size (2 small bites each). The Thai shrimp (6 total) were of good size and perfectly crisp from flash frying.  My wife enjoyed her Beauty Elizir cocktail, while I sipped on a bottle of apple cider. For an entre' we settled on the buttery 10oz filet. The 3 dipping sauces it came with were tasty. The Chorizo Mac & Cheese side was the bomb and a huge portion size. Zack surprised us with complimentary Happy Anniversary cake pops (chocolate-fudge). They were a nice surprise, and quiet good.  I'd recommend B&E if you are not on a fixed budget for sure...After the meal, I'd suggest heading up to Rose. Rabbit. Lie as we did for dome awesome live entertainment (band + singers + dancers).",

It was pretty busy, definitely suggest making a reservation.  The food was good! Six of us shared a selection of dishes. (For the price I was hoping to be blown away by every dish, wasn't quite the case but still pretty good.) The grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings were delicious and unique. Thai-style deep-fried shrimp was just lightly fried with good flavour. Mediterranean cauliflower was good. The kale and apple salad was okay (pretty standard) and the mushroom salad had great flavour but was overdressed. The two pastas we tried were decent - carbonara mac and cheese (very rich) and a pasta with pesto, egg, and cheese. Also tried scallops which none of us liked - we all found them too spicy (not mentioned on menu) and had a strange flavour.  We didn't order dessert but the servers brought out cake pops for us to share as they knew we were celebrating our friend's bachelorette; they were delicious!   Overall a great night and I'd go back again, but would probably just choose 2 or 3 dishes for myself to keep the price down, rather than sharing so many dishes. Portions were all over the place so I'd suggest asking the servers for recommendations about the size of the plates and how many dishes to order!",

    "text": "On September 30th, my group of 10 ventured over to Beauty and Essex for a nice dinner before seeing a show. Due to our large group size, we made certain we had reservations a few weeks in advance. I'll admit. I was intrigued by the idea that we had to go through a pawn shop, which they assured everything was all purchasable, to gain entry to the restaurant.   To no surprise, the restaurant and bar had a speak easy vibe. There was a long bar with low lighting. If you turned right, there was a round room for enjoying cocktails dressed in long velvet fabrics and chandeliers. If you continued on down the long bar, it opened to the dining area with antiques mirrors, more chandeliers and close knit seating. The acoustics of the room made it extremely hard to hear and our kind waiter, who seemed to be losing his voice, had some difficulty trying to explain the menu so he was patient enough to repeat himself around our table to make sure we understood everything.   All menu items are served tapas style. There were certain menu items that seemed very shareable but some of what seemed like main entrees such as steak and fish, which typically would be enough for an individual, was also presented as tapas. My group was confused and looked to me to suggest what to do because we don't have all the same taste and perhaps didn't want to share in everyone else's meal necessarily. I told them just to order how they usually would and if they wanted others to try the dish, just cut them a few bites... problem solved!   With the inability to hear each other when talking due to the loudness of the room and the ordering situation, my group was having doubt in my choice of restaurant... that was UNTIL the food came out. The food silenced their doubt and they were immediately consumed in eating and all smiles. Two of my friends ordered the steak, and it was probably one of the best we've enjoyed ever. Had they not shared some of it, I never would've expected I would find such amazing steak there!  My husband and I enjoyed the following: Chile Relleno Empanadas - poblano peppers, manchego cheese, jalapeno lime cream. Spicy but delicious! Spanish chorizo arancini - a lovely Spanish twist to an Italian family classic.  It had piquillo peppers, tomato, and saffron aioli.  Grilled cheese, Smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - familiar comfort food served on spoons. Tasty and a home run since it's always been a childhood fav!  Woodsman Cocktail - I didn't want an Old Fashioned since that's what I always order so I ordered this. It was Makers 46 Bourbon, allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon, and muddled pears. I really loved this.  Would we return? Definitely but maybe with a smaller group or even just my husband and I. This place is fits an intimate setting and even though they accommodate large groups, you can only truly enjoy the company of those immediately next to you. I love the atmosphere, and they even offered free champagne to the ladies before entering the pawn shop entrance. The staff was wonderful. Our waiter whose last name is Heimer (at least that's what the receipt listed) was so accommodating and patient. The guy who opened the door for us at the entrance of the pawn shop was so fun and even after took our group picture! What an awesome place overall!",

Low lighting, romantic, great spot for a date or celebration. The bar looked pretty cool also.  We ordered the zucchini pesto pasta, the mac and cheese and the turkey meatballs.

    "text": "For as many restaurants as there are on the Vegas strip, it was surprisingly hard to decide on a place for dinner. Vegas is filled with restaurants owned by celebrity chefs looking to cash in on the glamorous Vegas scene. There were plenty of overpriced steakhouses that established it was acceptable to charge $70 for a steak a la carte and $20 for an appetizer. I'm sure the food and service would've been top notch, but I wanted something more memorable that I couldn't easily find in Chicago. I was looking for a menu that was slightly unique but still offered familiar dishes, without venturing into the fine dining category. Beauty and Essex was the exact type of place I had in mind.  Ambiance: This place was super trendy, which is no surprise being located in the Cosmopolitan. The storefront was an actual thrift shop where you can buy various antique looking merchandise. The entrance to the restaurant is a discreet door behind the counter, which almost felt like a cool speakeasy entrance. Inside was dark with a super trendy and sexy atmosphere. There was a DJ playing throwback hip-hop jams, and the crowd was super lively with a lot of energy.   Service: Service was just alright. Our server felt a bit procedural, and didn't have a warm or inviting personality. He almost seemed apathetic when interacting with us. We went on a Thursday too, so it's not like they were getting slammed on a Saturday night. Also, throughout the night, it almost seemed like he took every opportunity to pressure us to order more than we wanted/needed, just to pump up the bill. For drinks we just asked for glasses of water, and they charged $8 for a jug of still water. Then for the food he claimed that we would need at least 5-7 dishes to satisfy us, but we saw at other tables that some of the dishes were pretty large portions, and in the end, the 4 we ordered was much more than enough. Finally, he was visibly disappointed when we opted not to order dessert or coffee after the meal. It's not like we were cheap asses either, as our bill between two people was almost $200.   Food: The menu here was more tapas style, where you get to try a bunch of dishes and then just share them. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the menu was exactly what I wanted: familiar food that had a slight twist to make them unique.   Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was clearly the must-order signature dish that everyone posts on the gram. It was a literal American interpretation of Chinese soup dumplings. Instead of the traditional pork and broth you usually see in xiaolongbao, they used the classic American grilled cheese and tomato soup combination with a nice addition of bacon. It came with 6 soup spoons with a layer of tomato soup, and then in the middle was a cube of melted cheese wrapped with bacon. Each spoon was the perfect bite.  Mexican street corn ravioli - While it seemed like a great idea for an elote-pasta fusion, I just thought this was ok. The portion was probably the smallest of our order. Taste-wise, I thought it was a bit too sweet from the corn, and needed more kick from that crema sauce, or saltiness from the cheese. Texture-wise, it was just carbs on carbs, and just felt like it was missing a key element.  Spaghettini - From the description, it sounded like they were gonna use zucchini sort've like spaghetti squash, but the dish was indeed actual pasta. The portion was pretty huge, and was hands down the best value dish. The flavor was on point too. The sauce was creamy with plenty of cheesiness, and the pesto brought a little bit of freshness and garlicky flavor. Then the egg on top is a nice tough to any dish.   Dry-aged sirloin - I was in the mood for a steak, and was a little disappointed they didn't offer a smaller sized ribeye (only the tomahawk), just the filet or sirloin. We went with the sirloin and were pleasantly surprised. The outside of the steak was seared absolutely perfectly, and the seasonings on the outside just caramelized to the meat. The steak was tender and juicy on the inside, and they went above and beyond by tossing in a bulb of roasted garlic too. What also made this steak unique was the variety of sauces that came with it. They gave a red chimicurri, green peppercorn hollandaise, roasted garlic bacon. The chimichurri was like a spicy salsa, and the peppercorn hollandaise was just bomb, super creamy and rich. I was most excited about the roasted garlic bacon sauce since those are my two favorite flavors haha, but I was disappointed to find out it just tasted like BBQ sauce.   Cake pops - After they saw it was our anniversary in the reservation, it was a nice surprise that they brought out some complimentary cake pops to celebrate the occasion.   Overall, I think Beauty & Essex was the exact place I hoped for when I was looking for a post-show dinner. It was the perfect combination of trendy and unique, but with great dishes that I couldn't easily find anywhere else.",

The decor is conversation worthy, wallful of portraits.  The service was prompt.   For two, we ordered the following which was filling:    - orange kissed salmon ceviche  - yellowtail sashimi - roasted bone marrow toast - Thai-style fried shrimp - onion rings - spaghettini (this is my absolute favorite).",

I made reservations online for a late dinner. I did specify that my husband and I were celebrating an anniversary and wanted a nice table, if possible!   When you arrive at Beauty and Essex, you walk through a real pawn shop...it's pretty cool, you can actually buy items. If not interested, go through to the hostess stand. The area is nice! My husband and I took a photo op there, lol.   As we were waiting for a table, we noticed there were some available, but we weren't being called. When we were finally called, the hostess mentioned she had us wait for a couple extra minutes so she could get us a nice table since we were celebrating an anniversary! I thought that was pretty awesome!   Upon being seated, our server greeted us rather quickly! She was super friendly and fun! She had good recommendations on drinks and explained how the food/menu worked!   For a cocktail, I got the O.D.B \"OLD Dirty Bramble\"! I mean how could I not with that name? It was tequila, blackberries, honey, ginger, and lemon. It was sooooo good! My husband got the Woodsman...which he liked.  Now for the amazing food! Everything we ordered was shareable, which I love... so you can try everything! We ordered the grilled cheese, bacon, and tomato soup dumplings. O-M-G! Soooo freaking good! I can still taste it and it's something that's craveable. Tasty and cute presentation! You MUST get these! Next, we had the Thai style fried shrimp. I've had my fair share of shrimp, but these were amazing! They were packed with flavor and probably the best shrimp I've had! I highly recommend these! We also ordered chicken meatballs with ricotta and truffle. These were very good as well. I feel like you could find something similar to this elsewhere, but still tasty. We also had an Asian inspired chicken and some brussel sprouts. Everything was very good! We were pretty full and definitely had food to go!   Our server acknowledged it was our anniversary and told us to save room for dessert! We ordered the reverse smores. Those were amazingly good! They totally hit the spot! And then, she came out with a complimentary anniversary dessert; cake pops! It was definitely a night of indulging! 2 desserts...why not?   The ambiance is nice. They have on some really good music, old school hip hop and r&b. The room towards the back had a bit of a different vibe than the front.   The food can be pricy. It is Vegas. It is owned by a chef on food network. But, it's worth it! I enjoyed every second of my dining experience! Lovely ambiance, wonderful service, and tasty comforting food!",

    "text": "If you're looking for a nearly identical experience to B&E in NYC, you'll be excited to visit the Vegas outpost.   The food, cocktail menu and layout are very similar to NYC - just a bit smaller.  Has a similar pawn shop entrance, which leads you to a small lounge and a few good sized dining rooms behind it.  Largest downside is that the bathrooms are outside the restaurant, so ladies - don't look forward to indulging in the complementary pink champagne in the bathroom a la Essex Street. The Cosmopolitan is interesting because it's restaurant scene is marked by successful NYC locations - B&E is accompanied by Blue Ribbon, Scarpetta, Momofuku, Milk Bar, Milos, and more.  If you're missing the NYC dining scene when in Vegas visit the Cosmopolitan.   I came here twice during my week in Vegas - once for drinks and once for dinner. Both times I ordered The Woodsman - a bourbon based cocktail accompanied by allspice dram, maple syrup, lemon and muddled pears.  For dinner, we indulged in all sorts of glorious things like the tomato & creamy burrata on toast, k-town bao burgers, kale & apple salad, and the thin crust goat cheese pizette, and oven braised chicken meatballs. Oh, and you do not come to B&E without ordering the grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings. We ordered that last one twice.   Like NYC, kale & apple salad and the grilled cheese dumplings were my favorite.  But it was also my first time having the chicken meatballs and they blew my mind.    All in all the standard experience.  Good time, good company and good food.  Worth your time and wallet.",

The entrees we're full of flavor but ranged from cold to lukewarm. They remade mine,  but it was just slightly warmer. Add to that,  we were seated at a crappy back corner table while the dining room was barely full,  right next to the kitchen.  The waiter had to ak his coworkers to keep it down because there was so much noise coming from the back.   If you are looking to dine at the Cosmo, I'd say opt for Jaleo across the way.",

    "text": "I had no interest in going to a pawn shop in Las Vegas.  Especially, one located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan.   But, why we're so many people walking in?  While we dined at DOCG next door, we saw large groups of well dressed people walk into this pawn shop and never return! So, we only ordered 2 small plates from DOCG ( both were delicious- meatballs and eggplant parmigiana) and decided to check out what the black hole next door was all about. OMG.  After walking into the pawn shop, we were then led into a gorgeous restaurant with leather bound wood walls and a classic bar.  This is the epitome of a \"Swanky Place\". Having just eaten small plates next door, we opted for their raw bar while sitting at the bar sipping on delicious gimlets.  The shrimp cocktail was served with a spicy cocktail sauce.  The dozen raw oysters were served with three types of sauces: vinegar, horseradish and cocktail.  Service was excellent.  The seafood was top of the line. Clap! Clap! Clap!",

Giving you the illusion that there isn't anything but the Pawn Shop there. There is someone there to take your reservation and will open a hidden door to unveil the actual bar and restaurant.   Once inside - the vibe and ambiance is very swanky. Cool bar and lounge area with a huge separated dining area.  Service was stellar and very attentive.   Now onto the food!  They serve American Tapas style food. The food here is delicious!  We ordered:  Tuna Tacos - small but packed with delicious flavor  Yellowtail Sashimi - Great  Lobster Tacos - Bomb! So much meat  Lobster Rolls - Really good  Bone Marrow spread - Really good  Steak Tartar - Bomb!  Short Rib Mac and Cheese - Favorite!  Scallops - Cooked Perfectly!   Chicken Arepas - Cold....not good. Don't get.   Overall, the food and ambiance is amazing here!",

    "text": "We chose to dine at Beauty & Essex after a last minute change of heart. We decided to go with a lighter menu, instead of the Steak and Chops place we had originally picked.  From the second I walked into the Pawn Shop in the afternoon to check if they had any availability that night, I could tell this establishment understood hospitality. I was treated like a welcomed guest rather than a last minute bother.   When we showed up early for our reservation, we were greeted like regulars even though it was our first visit. We stopped at the bar and ordered two glasses of Cava from Casey, our pleasant, friendly, informative bartender.  Before long, our table was ready and we were escorted to our table in the beautiful, if a little dimly lit dining room. The menu here is mainly small plate, meant for sharing type of set up. There are a few larger options listed under the Prime Meats section, but since we had steak the night before, we decided to stick with the smaller options.  Dish #1 Roasted Bone Marrow with Rioja Braised Shallot Marmalade and Grilled Bread.  Bone Marrow is everywhere these days, but we love it and order it just about every time we see it. This was one of our favorite versions ever. The combination of the Rich, Meaty Marrow, Sweet Shallots, Crunchy, Perfectly Grilled Bread was one of the best bites I've had in a long time.  Dish #2 Grilled Cheese and Smoked Bacon Dumplings on Tomato Soup.  These one bite wonders were the highlight of the night. They brought back childhood memories of dipping my grilled Velveeta sandwich into my Campbell's Tomato Soup, only a thousand times better!  Dish #3 \"Fish and Chips\" Tacos, Beer Battered Sea Bass, Chile-Lime Slaw, Crispy Matchstick Potatoes.  This was our least favorite dish of the night. It was still very good, but more one note than our other selections.  Dish #4 Basil Pesto Ravioli with Rock Shrimp and Tomato Fondue.  Excellent little pillows of pasta filled with a flavorful Pesto. They would've been fine on their own, but the sauce and perfectly cooked, juicy Shrimp took it to another level.  We were filling up so we decided against Dessert, but there were several items that looked very interesting that we will definitely save room for next time. Beauty and Essex is easily wheelchair accessible and service is wonderful. With so many dining options in Vegas, we only have two restaurants on our must visit list (N9NE and Julian Serrano Tapas). Beauty and Essex is a strong contender to become the third member!",

The outside of the restaurant is a pawn shop decorated with jewelry and guitars that you have to walk through to get to the inside of the restaurant. It really nails the speakeasy vibe right on! When you enter the hostesses are always so friendly and the staff is phenomenal! The manager Jeremy is the absolute best and super kind! There is a DJ in the center of the restaurant so this place is great for any celebratory occasion, bachelor/bachelorette party or perfect dinner spot before heading out to Marquee! The restaurant is dimly lit and the decor is very upscale and sexy. The cocktails are all amazing but my favorite is the Bubbles & Berries! You really can't go wrong with any of the food options either but the empanadas are a must! Great food. Great ambience. Great service. Definitely a must when in Vegas.",

And if you can get someone else to pay for you then that's even better.  I came here as part of an organized conference dinner, with a set menu.  They have large tables in private rooms, and were able to accommodate a party of ~20.  The menu had 10 dishes to it.  Appetizers included orange kissed salmon ceviche (good, unique citrus from orange, recommend), wedge salad (typical, depends on how you feel about blue cheese), roasted mushroom pizzetta (mushroom flatbread, deep flavor from caramelized onions and goat cheese), and Caesar Toast (caesar salad on toast, like a bruschetta).  The main course dishes were a Grilled Atlantic salmon in a sherry vinegar sauce and Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin (choice of red chimichurri, peppercorn hollandaise, or garlic and bacon sauce, cooked medium with lots of pink inside).  Sides included Char Grilled Green Beans (delicious with the Gochujang glaze and toasted sesame on top), and Vidalia Onion Ring tower (sambal ketchup had a kick from chili peppers).  For dessert I recommend the Les'NYC Doughnuts, with the thick and rich caramel sauce (also have dark chocolate or berry sauces), instead of the Carrot Layer Cake (was good for carrot cake, but is after all a carrot cake).",

The fries was the only thing very mediocre to me, I tried a few pieces but left it because I didn't want to get full of fries. The sprout grilled salad was also really good but the best was the steak that was cut medium for us. Will definitely try and bring my family here in the LA location.",

B & E is on the 3rd floor with a \"pawn shop\" entrance. So very Cosmo (just the right amount of wrong haha) and a cool departure from the norm!  Chef Santos has described B & E's food as \"whimsical\" and some of it did indeed exude a certain whimsy- small bites such as grilled cheese/tomato soup and a yummy slider are more than worthy of a mention!   Drinks were a hit, and my fave was the Emerald Gimlet. This basil infused gem was fresh and packed a punch! The second drink we tried was a boozy Arnold Palmer which was very refreshing.   The decor is typical upscale Strip restaurant with a myriad of rooms with tables and booths. Service was great and I always saw a few employees available and checking with the tables on a regular basis. However, enclosing the patio was a bad decision in my opinion. Nothing beats a Strip view with a swanky cocktail in hand!",

    "text": "Everything good ages and fades and so does beauty, apparently.  Chef Chris Santos brought his highly renowned Beauty & Essex restaurant from NYC to Las Vegas and a majority of its menu along with it.  This is not without change, however, and many things that make the former location great have simply gone missing.  The pawn shop in the exterior front greets you upon arrival.  A door past all the purchasable items leads you to the actual restaurant.  The ambiance is fitting to the name; dim, posh, beautiful with frames, lockets, and pendants hanging from the walls.  A walk past the bar led us to the first of three rooms to dine in.  Gone are the strip views present in the former occupant of this space (Comme Ca') and in its place, a wall.  Our meal for the night:  Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings-  A signature of B & E.   My daughter and wife enjoyed this more than I.    French Onion Soup Dumplings-  Warning. This can and will burn you the moment you take your first bite if you're not careful.   Not sure if it was the onions, a bit of soup, or what else filled the dumpling, but it did a number on my bottom lip.  Cautiously, I enjoyed the rest of these afterwards.  Yellowtail Sashimi-  Eight thinly sliced yellowtail topped with peppers in a soy chili sauce.  Excellent dish.  Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs -  Three delicious, large-sized meatballs topped with sheep's milk ricotta in a truffle sauce.  A must order when dining here in my opinion.  L.E.S. Donuts - Essentially malasadas which came with caramel, chocolate, and raspberry dipping sauces.  The first caramel sauce came out solidified, unable to be dipped so we asked for a replacement.  Not really worth the price.  The service was okay with minor hiccups.  A few times we asked questions about the food which could not be answered quickly.  The ice cream / sorbet flavors of the night could not be listed without our server having to excuse herself from our table to check back with the kitchen.    Of things to note:  No foie gras on the menu anywhere.  We are in Las Vegas!  While their NYC location at least offered foie for a certain time period, foie should be a given here and it really is one of the defining items of which I'd come back for if it were executed well.  Another MAJOR missing standout experience:  No champagne bar in the bathroom like its sister location in New York.  In fact, no bathroom at all inside the restaurant!  I asked a host to show us the bathroom to wash our hands and he proceeded to guide me outside past the pawn shop to the common areas of the Cosmopolitan.  As soon as I realized this, I told him I'll finish my dinner first and went back to my table.  The pricing of the items were a few dollars higher and I suppose 'justified' being located on the Las Vegas Strip.  With that said, the food was fairly expensive for what you do receive and I'm not sure anything we tried would have us returning a second time.    Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 27 / 100",

Everything from bone marrow to oysters ensued and all were eaten happily.  I let our server know that I had to be gluten free and she expertly told me what I could and could not have and brought my own substitutions where needed.  For instance, to replace bread for spreading the bone marrow on, they made be herbs & rice fried in the shape of bread fingers and brought those out hot and fresh.  Impressive.  I've never had anyone make those as a substitute for bread before and they were perfect.  Bar set & nicely done. Be fair warned, this place is loud.  It's front room is a pawn shop and then you enter into a dark loud speak-easy... and yes, it's actually perfect.  Not quiet by a long shot, but loud and perfect and the food won't let you down.",

It's the perfect balance of swanky and accessible, and I could totally sit here all night enjoying cocktails, the atmosphere, and the great playlist.   Not to mention that the food is phenomenal! We had the Chicken Meatballs, which were so light and so moist, and the Elote Style Scallops, which were perfectly cooked and super flavorful. I'm a sucker for s'mores, so we had the s'mores for dessert - SO GOOD! The marshmallow wasn't overly sweet.   As far as cocktails, I had the Bubbles and Berries, which seems to be their most popular cocktail. They also brought me a root beer shot along with our dessert.   I will totally be back here again! (In fact, we made reservations as we left to come back for dinner and cocktails before the Britney Spears concert.)   Cheers to Chris Santos and his team. What a fantastic find!!!!",

Some of the best flavored food I have ever had. Drinks were top notch as well! Had the melon mojito which had amazing flavor. The Dj was hot... Great music and there was a man playing the trumpet live to the Dj beats!  Amazing!",

We had a big group so waitress did say that for smaller dishes she would put in two orders. However sometimes it wasn't necessary to double up. For example, we ordered chicken meatballs and spaghettini. She put in two orders automatically. These dishes were both ok. So one order would have been fine especially since you can cut meatballs in half. Also dishes should have been staggered out a lil more. First two dishes were staggered. And then all of the other dishes we orders came out at once. Noise level was a bit louOverall good experience.",

They told me exactly how to find the spot.  I'm so glad I did. I came here with some coworkers.  We loved their tomato soup, the one that has the grilled cheese dumplings in it.  Some of my co workers gushed for days about their scallops, the ones with the bbq fries.  The service here was wonderful.  I ended up coming back here on my own, to have a nice drink before catching up with some other friends before we headed out to Marquee for the night. Tapas menus are wonderful and it's the perfect place to share so many things.  I really enjoyed their wedge salad too, not too huge and not too over done with dressing or other toppings. Everything was perfecto!! Beware. . . this venue is pretty tight. So, I don't know that it's the place for a big group unless you make arrangements with management somehow. I only mention that because while dining here, a large group of about 10-15 people strolled in and they almost had to consider sitting in smaller groups throughout the restaurant unless they were willing to wait for a cluster of tables to open up. oops",

We had a party of 11 and I was the only one with dietary limitations (of course). Our servers, Erin and Ian, found out what I needed to avoid and let me know with each course what I could and couldn't eat. We had the tasting menu and it was out of this world. From salad, to shrimp, to scallops, to lamb, to steak, to sorbet... phenomenal.   Our drinks were never empty and the food came out at the perfect pace so that we were neither rushing nor waiting for our next course.   Coming from a service industry background, I pay attention to things that others might not notice and I often get irritated by little things while eating out. That didn't happen at B & E even once thanks to Erin and Ian and the rest of the servers/food runners. The doorman even got me a band aid to help me get through the night on a sandal that was starting to bother my foot!  We had a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend it!",

My boyfriend and I had one drink each at the bar while waiting for other friends to arrive and the total for just that was $40 so be ready to spend some money. We ordered about 10 plates total and only one of them really stood out to me as amazing (the dumplings). I'm a fan of music playing in restaurants but the music here was so loud I couldn't talk to anyone except the person sitting directly next to me, yet my boyfriend and I agreed it was hard to hear the music at the same time the sound was not clear at all. For my \"birthday dessert\" they brought out a shot glass filled with what tasted like just whipped cream and it was filled almost halfway with sprinkles, not a fan. The 3 stars are mainly just for the decor.",

Got our drinks and then gave us some good recommendations on a few dishes. The food was perfect we got a few key dishes. There was not one thing that we would have changed about the experience.

We got up to leave and let the girls at the hostess stand know what had happened.    One of the girls, Brianna, was apologetic and offered to send out some complimentary dishes if we wanted to give them another chance, seated in a different area.  We agreed and were sat with a very attentive server (Paulo?), who brought out a couple of popular dishes, at no charge to us.  Every dish we had was yummy, with my favorites being the tomato tartare, the grilled cheese dumplings with tomato soup, and the cauliflower.  (We ordered mostly side dishes)  My husband loved the bone marrow.  Brianna came to check on us during dinner, as well.  Good, craft cocktails, yummy food, the ambience and great customer service were much appreciated!",

    "text": "This was my first time at Beauty & Essex as I have heard good things about the New York location. We made reservations for a party of 3 on a Sunday night and were promptly seated at a nice booth when we arrived.   The menu is tapas style where everything comes in smaller sharable servings. We ordered the following:   1. East & West Oysters - exactly what the name suggests and tasted fresh. No complaints! 2. Apple and Kale Salad - this was okay, it was a little on the sweet side for my taste but someone who enjoys kale salads would probably like this dish. 3. Yellowtail Sashimi - our favorite out of everything we ordered. It was situated in a citrus soy sauce which complemented the fish well. Tasted fresh and would've ordered more if we weren't full at the end. 4. Roasted Bone Marrow - good flavor with the coarse sea salt and fatty like it should be. Pairs nicely when spread on the toasted bread. 5. House-made Cavatelli - comes in a light red sauce with sausage. Tasty but not worth ordering at a restaurant like this as it's not as unique. 6. Avocado, Lemon, & Espelette - a fancy version of avocado toast with a hint of a tangy twist. I liked it but not sure if it's worth the price. Order seafood instead! 7. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - these were good but came less as tacos and more poke on small wonton cups. I love tuna so I enjoyed it. 8. Shishito Peppers - average and was a little on the oilier side but I'm not a fan of shishito peppers usually so that could be why.  In terms of drinks, I had a couple Emerald Gimlets. Wasn't overly sweet and the basil provided good balance. It looked and tasted like a craft cocktail - I recommend it.   Definitely try making reservations if you're looking for a dinnertime meal as the restaurant was full when we arrived at 7:30PM on a Sunday night. The experience you get by walking into the \"pawn shop\" and led into a secret side door is pretty neat in itself.",

We started with the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos and Pulled Chicken Arepas  which were delicious, but tiny. For entree we had the Mediterranean Cauliflower which was okay, and the Szechuan Chili Dusted Scallops which were cooked well and nice and spicy.  Pricey and small dishes, but I'm used to that. Overall I would recommend!",

    "text": "This place was a tough review. I found my myself struggling to want to enjoy the experience but kept getting slapped in the face with the reality of eating slightly better than mediocre food at Ferrari prices. The restaurant has all the signs a of a promising culinary experience. When entering the restaurant there's a great facade of a pawn shop that is designed to emanate a speak easy style entrance. A back door behind the pawn shop display leads to a dark, interior designer assured looking restaurant with the usual Vegas hotness caliper of hostesses behind a desk.   I started with a dirty martini and instantly felt betrayed by the water-downed 18 dollar warm mixture. Even the cheese filled olives felt a gushy warm and soft mess as I mixed them with my wet martini sipping and chewing simultaneously ever so skillfully.   An interesting house salad it was. Comprised of tasty lettuce with a side spread of hummus topped with sunflower seeds. It was as though it focused on making a salad with a beauty and Essex twist.  Something special only found here it seemed to want to say. Successful on the twist and yet lacking any substantial flavor. My wife said to me \"it's missing citrus or something. Agreed - Blandish it ''twas.   The main course was comprised of scallops, lamb chops, and a side of their macaroni. While the scallops were cooked to perfection I wasn't impressed by their accompanied puree carrot stuff that they sat upon. There was also some sort of shaved plastic like transparent things sitting on top of the scallops that were colored orange. I was expecting them to taste like cheese or something. However they were absolutely and surprisingly flavorless.  What were these transparent pedal like chips I thought to myself? the whole time I ate this orange mess. Distracting for sure and took away from the excellent scallops.   The lamb chops were ok. They came on a bed of polenta, which was also ok. What I remember most about the chops was the way the fat on them seemed to wrap around them and how I needed to go about not eating this slimy layer. Sometimes when a steak or lamb chop is cooked to perfection I'll cut through the meat and fat without favor and chomp on what may be, because it all looks, cuts, and taste so good. Not this time. No sir I made sure to peel that squishy tape layer of mush off whatever tasty morsels I could find.    The Macaroni killed it for me. I mean it was good but... it just wasn't expensive restaurant good. I know I know - how good can macaroni really be. Well believe it or not I've had macaroni that will knock you on your ass but this was like a flavor I expect to find at Cheesecake Factory style restaurants. It just wasn't on par with any expectations.   So speaking of expectations - vegas strip, premium prices, upscale ambience - I expect the food to be top notch. It just wasn't. It fell short. Not super short, but short enough to say it was ok but I won't come back again. Funny my wife said the same thing.",

    "text": "Finally, I made it to the place everyone's been telling me to go: Beauty and Essex!   Food: Here, the cuisine is very diverse and is all about sharing! Tapas style cuisine is how B & E operates! We tried some simple dishes like their onion rings,kale and apple salad, along with the poke tacos that came recommended. All of the food was amazing and delicious with just enjoy flavor. I did think the poke tacos should've come with 4 versus 3 as an even number versus most people like us paying for the 4th.  Drinks: Beauty & Essex has some Handcrafted cocktails to die for! We tried the Green with Envy (pretty spicy) and the Delorean which was perfectly savory! The purees and add ins were fresh and there was lots of love and time taken to make each drink.    Ambiance: B & E has a pretty cool vibe! There's a pawn shop storefront before you head into the restaurant which was a cool surprise. As you walk in for dinner, there's a mellow DJ playing casual music you can talk over while bopping around to. The decor was super eclectic. There was lots of good and pearl and black mixed with small elements that made the walls hard to not stare at!   Service: Everyone from the front staff to our server to the bartender and service staff made the experience a positive one! Each person was friendly while offering recommendations and checked in on our experience. They were quick but didn't make us feel rushed if you know what I mean.  Overall:  I can't wait to visit here again when I'm hanging out at the Cosmopolitan. B & E is one of the awesome places you find that remind you of just why the Cosmo is such a unique hotel compared to most. The environment is hip and casual while also being a tad upscale for dinner!",

I didn't even have to use the sauces it came with because it was so dang good. The avocado toast was so dang good as well, and of course the grilled cheese in tomato soup dumplings are a must.   The service here is absolutely great - they filled up the water every single sip. The steak actually came out a lukewarm (not hot) and we told them, and they took it back and made us a new one. I don't mind that the steak was not served hot, but they still get 5 stars for remedying the stiuation.  Thank you guys!!",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is a very beautiful restaurant. From our food choices, most of them are pretty good and some are just OK. You have to go in through the pawnshop which is kind of cool. It is a tapas style restaurant and the portions are small & made for sharing. So, definitely don't go too hungry. They do not have any type of bread service. We did get the artichoke flatbread which had good bread but the artichoke topping was cold and had very little artichoke. It seemed like it had more onions and garlic.  Next was the mac & cheese which really was good. I didn't care for the little pieces of ham too much. And as for their famous tomato soup dumplings, it really didn't blow my mind. And, it comes in six little tiny teaspoons. So very little of it.  Next was served the Thai shrimp and chili dusted scallops, both were a little spicy and very good. We did enjoy both of those.  Lastly, we got the caramel cinnamon apple dessert. It was just bland. Nothing special at all. They did try to bring a second exact dessert to our table & we only ordered one. Then, when we got the check we did notice that there were two charges, I'm glad that we noticed. The service was pretty good. The gentlemen were nicer than the ladies. At one point a lady asked how was dinner and I said \"pretty good\" and she smirked at me and said \"it was good? Oh good.\" As if I was NOT allowed to say \"pretty\" good. There was a little sarcasm and fakeness with the two ladies. We had about four different servers which was a bit confusing. Overall, it was a nice experience. The restaurant is gorgeous and some of the food was very good. I don't know if I will come back. I would much rather go to STK next door, where there is more food and better service.",

On the most recent visit with a coworker on a  \"Tour De Cosmo\" we came here for a dinner with amazing cocktails, bites, and most importantly dessert. K.C and Alison took fantastic care of us and made recommendations as their menu had changed from the last time I came in.   To start, I recommend the tuna poke tacos, Mexican corn ravioli, and their Thai shrimp. Everything was coursed out appropriately and K.C & Alison always made sure our waters were full, and utensils changed at every course.   I couldn't leave without their infamous doughnuts for dessert, and was ecstatic when they came out piping hot with three dipping sauces. I wish I wasn't completely stuffed or else I could have finished all of them by myself. Although the place is dark, it makes for an amazing dining experience where you completely forget you're in the Cosmopolitan at all. Highly, highly recommend for your next Vegas experience!",

We got lucky and met chef Chris Santos, who came out and congratulated our table (mom just finished chemo). Really was incredible.   The grilled cheese dumplings and tomato soup bites were fantastic. Chicken meatballs were another favorite. We loved the toast. They let you add on additional bites to make sure everyone at your table is served at least one portion.   The service was outstanding, the atmosphere was so much fun, and the wine list was excellent.  The shop in the front was a great addition to the experience. Must visit!",

    "text": "This was my second time in.    The first time I came here (and totally forgot to do a yelp review) we had a lot of food.  Over ordered so much that we were rolling out of the restaurant.  But the menu is so creative and everything sounds so interesting we just didn't know how to stop.  Shout outs to the tuna poke tacos and the roasted bone marrow.  I also had quite a few of the cocktails, most of which were very strong (good thing I had a lot of food to go with them).  Hello O.D.B. and Beauty Elixir.  Soooo gooooood.    The only thing that bothered me was that my bf at the time had to go back to the room to change his clothes in order to eat here.  When we did come back, someone wearing almost EXACTLY what he was wearing the first time was seated next to us.  Apparently, my ex's nice grey cargo shorts were not as good as the pastel plaid cargo ones on the guy next to us?  This time around, I came with a friend who said he felt under-dressed which does make sense.  The inside of this restaurant is dark and seriously sexy with all the spot lighting and necklaces.  The \"booth\" side of the table was a crushed blue velvet recamier.  Sexy AF.  We were't terribly hungry so we just ordered a few things but man again, the creativity is spot on and the food just tastes good.  I have also never tried a dark Spanish rose and it was quite excellent.  Might become my new fave.    The service here is always on point.  You will never run out of water.  And the food comes out well timed and explained to you.    Overall, this is a really nice spot to bring anyone, a date, your friends or family, for a great meal with excellent service.",

This man is a gem so I highly recommend you request him & hopefully you get lucky.   We went for a girlfriend's Birthday & had a drink as we waited to be sat. The ladies in the front were friendly,  beautiful, and had great customer service. Once our table was ready the magic began. We had 3 in our party which was perfect in regards to sharing plates. A lot of dishes are proportioned  perfectly for a smaller group fyi so we ordered a bunch of different plates to share.   The first thing to come out was the ahi wonton tacos (DELICIOUS), the smoked tomato soup & dumpling appetizer, then we had a shrimp dish, mac & cheese (I wouldn't order again), lamb, meatballs, a couple of special items compliments of the chef, a delicious birthday surprise of donuts with 3 miniature ice creams to share, & of course cocktails!!! I'd like to mention I typically don't eat lamb, but the way this was prepared literally tasted like heaven on earth. Omg, just order it and LIVE your best life lol.

The waitress told us the dishes are to share, but they're pretty tiny, so you can eat on your own or share, up to you.  They suggested between 4-6 dishes for 2 people.  Tacos The best dish hands down was the ahi tuna tacos. We also ordered the octopus tacos, but don't waste your money. You can barely taste them and the ahi tuna knocked it out of the park. But beware, it's between $16-$18 each and you only get 3 tacos. You will still be hungry....  Entree We also ordered the mexican street corn ravioli - that was pretty innovative. It was truly a cool way to feel like your'e eating both mexican street corn and pasta. I'd get this again, it was around $20  We also ordered: Onion ring - hey no judging they looked good at our neighbors table (and they were)! Thai-style deep fried shirmp - 5 pieces of shrimp - so tasty and fully cooked  Dessert Les NYC Doughnuts - the dark chocolate fudge, berry & caramel sauces really made this dish 10/10.

    "text": "Seriously one of the best dinners I've had the pleasure to experience. You have to walk through a pawn shop before you enter the restaurant and they offer a comp glass of champagne to the ladies. When you get into the restaurant it is dark, mysterious, decorated in jewelry and feels like a speakeasy. All of the staff are good looking as well :] The restaurant is quite loud but it's very fun.  Our server was Erin and she was super sweet, recommended amazing dishes for our table, and very personable with our large group!  Keep in mind everything is served as small plates, so you will want to order quite a few to share amongst the table. Some of my favorite things to try:  -The poke wonton tacos....mmmm omg I don't even like raw fish but the flavor in these were amazing -grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings were small but delicious -my first time trying bone marrow and it was great -grilled salmon was the best I've ever had prepared -the lamb chops came up on a second to only Milo's next door but still fantastic -green with envy cocktail which had celery salt and was one of the best cocktails I've ever tried  I loved the food, ambience, atmosphere, and people. All of it put together made for a great evening!",

Small store front pawn shop (with actual things for sale) and the unassuming door which leads into the dimly lit and elegant dining rooms!   We were researching which restaurants were trendy and worth a visit. When Beauty and Essex came up in that list, we were glad we tried it out! Got a 7:45 reservation on a Thursday night on Open Table.   Taste: 9/10 Truffle Oil!  We shared the Mushroom Truffle flat bread, the sweet potato ravioli and the lamb. Peanut Butter sundae dessert.   Service: 10/10 Waitress didn't skip a beat, food came out very fast, super friendly and attentive.   Value: 9/10 For Vegas, this was exceptional value! Our bill total was about the same amount as if we had gone for burgers and wings in a moderate American sit down. Gotta love high end food that doesn't have an inflated price to match.   Bathrooms: Meh. This is the only thing we didn't like. Bathrooms are located outside the restaurant in the hall of the casino.   Location:  In the Cosmopolitan! Perfect location!  All in all, very cool experience, great food and awesome ambiance. We will be back for sure!",

My little birdies did not disappoint, the food was great!   To start we had the Caesar toast and tomato soup dumplings. The toasts were very tasty and I loved the unique and delicious chicken skin topping. The dumplings though were by far my favorite part of the entire meal, a must try! For an entree we shared the burger. It was good, but nothing above the ordinary. It was also the perfect size to share. To finish we had the Kygo cloud nine dessert. It's super rich, but very good! Great for any chocolate lovers.   I do have to say one thing though I don't recommend this place as a romantic night out since it's super loud and club feeling. It's definitely great for a birthday dinner before a night at marquee though.",

Chicken dumplings were lukewarm at best, this item should be served hot! 2.) dozen Oysters were soooo tiny and at $35.00 they should not have even offered these to paying customers... horrible! 3.) Chorizo mac and cheese: the Chorizo was so hard or gummy it was not eatable!   I am a \"foodie\" and dine out regularly at fine dinning establishments, but Beauty & Essex is one I can not recommend! Also the dinning room was very cold in temperature.",

We ordered the \"Les, Nyc\" Doughnuts and I believe my drink was called Green With Envy. They both tasted delicious and I have my server to thank for the suggestions. I can't remember her name but she was so welcoming and she walked us through the menu and answered all our questions.

They were happy to provide us with a vegan menu, and let me tell you.. it did NOT disappoint!  My cocktail was INSANITY, I loved the Pink Panther! But really, The whole meal was magical and I kept eating and eating until my stomach hurt.  To finish off the meal, we had these delightful alcoholic dessert shots which I also thoroughly recommend.

Our server was superb- she was sweet, knowledgable and attentive.    Now for the food... We ordered the 'Chile Relleno' empanadas, Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs, a Flatbread of some sort and a nice bottle of pinot. The wine was great; I have nothing but praise for our wine! As for the empanadas, I think I could get better frozen empanadas from Trader Joes. They're ok if you want that frozen, heated in a convection oven type of a meal- which I do sometimes, but just not at top dollar. The meatballs were ok, a little hard- like maybe they put too much bread crumbs in the mix. They weren't the worst, but they had a sort of golf ball element to them. The flatbread was good, because hey- how can you screw up bread?   I think this place is great to come for a cocktail hour or a glass of wine at the bar while you wait for a table to open up next door. Just know you're paying for ambiance, not the quality of food.",

The short ribs were amazing and the garnish was fantastic. The BBQ fries were also very good. My 3 issues were the short ribs came out warmish, not hot or even very warm. (I like very warm/hot food) also the fries seasoning was great but there was a little too much and was a little overwhelming at times. Also I sat toward the wall on a 2 person table the the AC vent was blowing at hurricane strength on me and my food. Please but some vent covers that directs the air in the center of the room.",

Besides cocktails, we ordered desserts! Donuts were pretty bomb and the one I loved the most was the Kygo Cloud 9!! Oh my gosh, can I please go back and take another bite of that deliciousness?!

First of all, the place was so incredibly loud that I literally couldn't talk to my husband who was two feet across the table from me. We could also barely hear our server, and I felt like I had to yell at him to order. There was a party of about twenty women right behind us who kept cheering and yelling and singing and honestly just being obnoxious. I understand that there is little the staff could've done to quiet them down, but maybe they could've been seated in one of the more private areas?   For cocktails, we each ordered the woodsman, which was meh. It was a little flavorless and really didn't taste like the description.   For food, we split: - caesar toast: very tasty and fresh; one of my favorites - k-town bao burger: needed more sauce and seasoning - chile relleno empanadas: quite yummy, but a little cold when they came out - grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings: our favorite dish; they were fun and inventive - roasted mushroom pizzetta: underwhelming; I didn't taste the truffle cream at all - carrot layer cake: the cake itself was great, but the ice cream just felt unnecessary and didn't complement the cake very well  I thought it was a bit annoying that you had to exit the restaurant to use the bathroom. The pawn shop idea in the front seems cute, but it's just another barrier when getting to the bathroom, especially since so many people were crowded in there.",

As far as the menu goes ... it's not traditional and is kind of all over the place. Most plates can be shared. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted but here are my must have recommendations: Thai style deep fried shrimp and their char grilled green beans. The salmon was also very tasty. I would not recommend the artichoke grilled flat bread or the spaghettini. They also had some good cocktails.  Overall a good experience.",

We shared: roasted bone marrow, grilled cheese dumplings(pictured), broccolini, bbq fries, chorizo mac and cheese, and oven braised chicken meatballs. Literally all of it was delicious. The bone marrow you scoop out of the bone and pile on top a piece of toast along with a nice marmalade. The broccolini sauce was amazing. Five stars!",

    "text": "When I heard that Beauty and Essex was opening their second location in Las Vegas I was so excited. It is my favorite restaurant in New York City and Las Vegas is much closer to LA than NYC. That being said, I was a little bit underwhelmed by my visit. Points were automatically lost when we had a reservation and still had to wait to be seated for 45 mins. With many shows and people needing to be places in Vegas, they need to get better about sticking to their reservation times. When seated, we were put right next to the POS computer stand which was a little annoying because servers would keep coming by to grab plates or menus. The food was good and the service was great once we were seated though. As always, the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings were amazing. The real disappointment was the lobster rolls. This is certainly a dish that you can skip. The server even suggested we get an extra one to split the order evenly since they generally come with 3. Needless to say the extra $11 or something crazy was a waste because we didn't even want to eat it. We had to rush through our meal because we were already 45 minutes behind. Call me crazy, but when I drop $200 on a meal I would have liked to savor and enjoy it a bit more. I am not sure what it was, but this location lost a bit of the magic that it had in NYC. I have reservations for the new location that just opened up in LA in a couple of weeks so hopefully, that one will impress me a bit more!",

I had a gimlet that was a bit heavy on the liquor for my tastes, but my husband got something with Beauty in the name (beauty elixir, maybe?) and it tasted like a strawberry starburst.  :).

    "text": "I was not expecting to love this place so much. I figured it was more about the vibe and novelty of the whole Beauty and Essex pawn shop in the front gimmick... I was so so so wrong, and I am so glad I was. I hadn't read the reviews and hadn't heard anything from friends who had dined here but I'd love to shout from the rooftops about how delicious the food here is, and exciting too..  Our waiter was amazing, I think his name was David (?), he was top notch and wish I could just have him as my waiter everywhere I go. Stellar job, amazing attitude, he made the experience fun and we were so grateful to have him as our waiter. That being said, I am not sure if I've had a dinner that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed our dinner at Beauty & Essex. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos, and then we ordered another order of them after we finished our entire meal - yes, they were that good. The flavors are perfectly balanced and these are just SO good. We may have gone back the next night and picked up a quick order of these \"to go\" because we could not stop thinking about them! We also ordered caesar toast (yum!), the french onion dumplings (holy moly!), the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumpling (amazing!), scallops (prepared perfectly) and... I think that was it. Oh, and bone marrow (ahh, why you gotta be so good?!).   Everything was phenomenal and I could have sat there all night, eating everything over and over and over again.  We had to get dessert, right? The donuts are killer good. Light and fluffy served with 3 sauces (chocolate, butterscotchy caramel and a raspberry sauce) - *sigh* these were so freakin' amazing. We also ordered the PB ice cream thing which comes topped with pretzels, I don't even have the words to describe how amazing this one was. Beauty & Essex, you done did a great job and I cannot wait to come back. Everyone who works here is so friendly and you really don't get that pretentious vegas vibe that a lot of other places give off. Oh, it is loud inside, but you wont be talking much because the food is really that incredible and there are no words great enough to describe it.  I really hope this place stays as good as it is right now and doesn't go through that rough patch of bad service and inconsistency. B&E, thank you for such a wonderful experience, and to our waiter, you are the man!",

While in the Cosmo you would never know it's there as it's 'hidden' through a pawn shop entrance, giving it a bit of a secret society appeal. The very first thing i noticed was how LOUD it was, even at the host stand we could barely hear each other and it got worse as we progressed to the back to our table. The guests has to speak loudly because the club music was over the top loud. It was like a JOB to be able to listen to and comprehend our server... Pros: great speakeasy feel and hidden, FOOD was amazing, server was wonderful. Cons: LOUD, too LOUD for quiet conversations, tables too small for a tapas restaurant and very very crowded.",

While it doesn't feel as authentic, because it is in The Cosmopolitan and not the Lower East Side, this 9 week old restaurant still managed to pull off an over the top cool vibe.  We loved the build out with the Pawn Shop in the front again and then the whole different world behind the secret door.   The DJ was great.  She set a great mood.   We shared the tuna tacos, chicken meatballs with a truffle sauce and grilled cheese smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings.  The tuna tacos were excellent, but the other 2 dishes were to die for. Just out of this world.   The only negative thing we have to say about this place, was that the male hosts at the check in area were quite rude and had serious attitudes.   We waited for a little bit at the bar, because we were a little early and did end up waiting past our reservation time.   We very much enjoyed the blonde bartender at the bar. I wish I asked her her name. She said she has been with the Tao Group at some of their other properties. She was very warm and friendly. We felt like we were watching an artist make drinks.  She suggest the Pink Panther and I really enjoyed the drink.   The Tao Group has another winner on its hands. Im still thinking about those meatballs and dumplings.",

My body also knows/tells me when to not eat something...that was tonight after ordering a $95 seafood dinner. Oysters and clams were nothing less than rotten. LITERALLY. I still can't get the smell off my hands. No one apologized, blinked an eye when they saw I sent back 98% of my  $95 meal. There was 3 bites taken out. I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan. Not shy of spending  $.....where it's worth it. #dontgetsick",

Started with oysters (slurp!), yellowtail sashimi with a ponzu sauce (Damn!), the grilled cheese with roasted tomato soup (double damn!). Then we had the amazing smashed avocado toast. Lastly we had the scallops and they were cooked to perfection. Wifey says we will definitely be back!!",

Next we ordered a main course, chicken meatballs. $21. Would you like to order another meatball sir? No. The meatballs were served with a sauce on top and nothing else. They were cold. Not that tasty. Next was the \"grilled cheese sandwiches\" with tomato soup. $19. The so-called grilled cheese sandwiches were tiny soggy, round sandwiches served on 7 plastic spoons. No bread service. I purchased bread that came out over toasted and dry. Hardly a meal. A glass of champagne and a beer and the tab was well over $100. We left and ate a proper dinner somewhere else. Atmosphere and service were great.",

We had passed by while sightseeing on the strip and I absolutely love it in my city of NYC. So why not go again?! Excited to try and show my bf what an awesome restaurant this is, we went for dinner. Date night in full effect. I had made a rsvp. Upon arrival, we checked in with the lovely hostess and were told that our table was not ready if we could wait. She gave me a buzzer. Ok no problem. So we sat down at the lounge area and ordered a drink. It was nice to relax. My drink got there and not even 5 mins the buzzer went off. We were then seated in the main dining room. Checking out the menu, I was kind of disappointed at the fact that some of the items I loved in the NYC menu were not offered here. For example, the short ribs with the hush puppies was no where to be found on the menu. What was on it was the short rib mac and cheese. So I ordered that. Also we ordered a tostada or pizza of some sort. It wasnt wow but was delish nonetheless. I ordered a hennessy on the rocks just to compliment the meal. I left satisfied yet not full. The food was just the right amount. I was not wowed here like at the one in NYC, but my dining experience was nice. I shall come back to see if they raised the bar.",

My go to dessert is the Strawberry Shortcake Bars. Liquid cheesecake, white chocolate and cap' n crunch.

Our problem was after waiting for almost an hour in the bar to be seated, we saw several couples who had arrived after us be taken to their tables.  My husband checked and they said they were running behind and they gave us a card for free appetizer, which would have been fine but we never saw a server in the bar.  Checked back and was told there was 1 reservation ahead of us, so great we would finally be able to order some food(starving by this point). I then saw 4 couples taken to tables ahead of us, at that point we had been waiting for our table for an hour and half and had enough.  Our evening was spoiled and I can't even believe we waited as long as we did! So very disappointing",

I've been to a lot of Vegas restaurants but this entrance was definitely cool. We had a variety of things, tuna tacos, k bao burger, thai shrimp, salmon, caesar salad toast, and chocolate tartes. Toast and salmon were good and everything else was great. Drinks were good and so was service.

We called when we were lost in the Cosmo and said we would be there soon.  We didn't get seated 'til about 8:30. They comped a round of drinks, a round of shots and an appetizer.  We were a party of 5 and shared the filet, lamb chops, crab legs, salmon, scallops, mac n cheese, grilled cheese bites with tomato soup, and green beans. Food was good and did not feel heavy at all for the amount we ate.  However, something didn't sit right with two of us.  One ended up sick (as in, threw up within hours) and I had an unsettled stomach.  Not the best feeling after a meal.

Well, perhaps because now I understad what your standards are when it comes to  flavor, presentation and creativity, the 3 main components that the Chefs get rated on the show....  The BBQ thai chicken was truly divine...... The chicken was cooked to perfection while marinated in BBQ sauce along with lemongrass & ginger sauce... And to make the dish even more amazing, there was this delicious parsnip puree flavored with coconut cream......   The tuna was as amazingly delicious as the chicken, perhaps more....It was seared to perfection, served with delicious yellow & green beans....  As a huge onion ring hater, I got addicted to the onion rings served here..... The batter was not too thick but flavorful.... The onions were seasoned perfectly while being sweet and delicious.....  I would have said, I can't wait to dine here again when I come to Sin City next, but guess what?! They are opening  another B&E location  in DTLA this January!   Anyways, Chef Santos, you are my favorite judge on Chopped now....  Thank you and you are welcome...:-)",

It was lush and blinged out with beautiful chandeliers. There was a D.J. playing great music. Service was on point & everything that landed on our table was enjoyed by all.   We ordered a variety of dishes to share which included The Roasted Bone Marrow, Chile Relleno Empenadas, K-Town Bao Burger, Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs, Mexican Street Corn Ravioli and plain MAC & Cheese made for my 10 year old at our request.   We ended this fun and amazing experience with The Carrot Layer Cake & \"Les, Nyc\" Doughnuts.   Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Top notch everything! Coming from NYC and Food Network's Chris Santos, B&E was already an experienced restaurant that knows how to provide a great experience. If you come with a group of all girls, you are treated to a glass of Prosecco in a little lounge area. You then enter the restaurant through what looks to be an upscale pawn shop and make your way over to the large door that transports you into the world of beauty. Every bit of decor is well thought out, from the gorgeous lighting fixtures in the entry which function as a work of art in themselves, to the frames with vintage necklaces hanging in them which create a faux wall. There is a bar/lounge and even a Dj spinning. Every staff member is courteous, experienced, and professional.  You don't have to spend a ton of money here although the atmosphere is upscale. Cocktails are on the pricey side so if you leave those out, your bill won't be too high. Food is meant to be shared family style and comes out pretty quickly. I wish they would have paced it a little better. But between 7 of us we shared 5 dishes and ordered one cocktail, and only spent $26 each after a generous tip. The food was phenomenal, and some dishes were quite unique.   The most unique dish was the French Onion Soup Dumplings. They are served in a little dish topped with a huge melted layer of cheese, and you pick it up with the toothpick. It gives you a burst of flavor! The Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs were another favorite of mine. You are served 3 large, juicy meatballs topped with a mound of whipped ricotta, sitting in a wild mushroom and truffle sauce. These are a must. The Garganelli is a lamb bolognese instead of beef, so the flavor was a little odd to me and this was the only dish I would pass on.   As for the desserts, we were served a complimentary sampler platter. The Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme was out of this world! The butterscotch was so smooth and creamy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. I basically ate this whole thing by myself. Another favorite was the Spiked Root Beer Float Shot. This was so unique and fun, and even had sprinkles in it. So much more on the menu sounded great that I can't wait to come back the next time I am in Vegas. Be sure to make a reservation far in advance because it gets packed in there.",

They do a decent job of recreating the vibe of the NYC original, but in grand Vegas scale. Staff is accommodating, knowledgeable, and will adjust any of your orders so everyone can have a taste. Recommend the tuna poke tacos and the bone marrow toast is a special presentation. Cocktail menu has a lot of interesting twists on the classics, try the Pink Panther. Not 5 stars because we did have to wait a bit even though we had a reservation. It wasn't an unpleasant wait, but if you need to be somewhere just pad your time.",

I made reservations via OpenTable for a Wednesday evening and off we met in Vegas with our plus ones (my husband and her friend).  You enter through a pawn shop into a dimly lit speakeasy. The menu is tapas style and all of the plates are meant for sharing. Drinks are strong and the service was friendly and attentive. FYI, the bathroom is located outside of the restaurant and doesn't follow NYC's \"champagne served in the women's restroom\" trend, wah!  Memorable plates: * Yellowtail sashimi * Tuna poke wonton tacos * Grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings * Elote style scallops * Ice cream and sorbet selection (housemade daily, flavors vary but all of the ones we had were the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!)  Just \"A-OK\": * Cauliflower (but it's hard to mess that up!)  The next time I dine here, I would pass on: * Short rib mac & cheese (way too salty!) * Oven braised chicken meatballs (the texture was odd)  Overall, I had a good dining experience here. It's one of the more fun and less \"stuffy\" dining spots inside the Cosmo, and I definitely would come back again.",

    "text": "Food-- disappointing dish after disappointing dish. Overcooked steak: I asked for medium. I got almost well done. This was disappointing. Even left a few pieces behind....   French onion soup dumplings: Served at room temp (barely warm), so the cheese wasn't  ooey or gooey.  Short rib Mac and Cheese: the mac and cheese tasted good but there were tiniest morsels of short rib that you could barely see or taste.   Ambience--not nearly as glamorous or stunning as the one LES. Not even close.  Also, the free champagne bar is outside of the restaurant, which is kind of weird, logistically speaking. Even weirder than a bar in a bathroom!       Drinks--Cocktail list is almost identical to the one in the LES. Drinks here are pricey and strong. Sadly, I couldn't finish my second drink, but since we are in Vegas they poured it into a \"to go\" cup for me.    Service-- the bartender was efficient and the server was extra bubbly. It's unfortunate the food was so bad.    Final verdict: I came here hoping I would have the same great experience as the The B&E in NY but the Lower East Side location is better than the Vegas location in all aspects.",

I ordered a drink with makers mark in it I believe it was called woodsman very delicious. Good portion was small but just enough, to leave room for the dessert. Some type of sugary cinnamon type doughnuts with three different sauces. Overall it was a good vibe. They have one in Los Angeles where I live so I will have to visit so I can compare.

She said the table was getting ready so my friend and I went to the bar to grab a drinks (we both ordered the bubbles and berries- V good). About 15 minutes later our table was ready. The table we were sat at was a nightmare. I kept getting bumped and requested that we be moved (which was no big deal and was taken care of immediately).   When we moved the new waitress came over introduced herself and discussed the menu. Since we had a late lunch we didn't order too much but the waitress guided us through what to order. I was bummed we couldn't order more.   Food:  Tuna poke tacos- AMAZING!  Peach and buratta toast- was not a fan. I would suggest skipping it.  GRILLED CHEESE, SMOKED BACON & TOMATO SOUP DUMPLING- so good!!!   Our waitress kept checking in on us, but it felt more like we were being rushed. We enjoyed our food ordered and sipped on a few more drinks but it seemed like she just wanted us to keep it moving.   I was also a bit bummed that nothing was done for my bday since it was mentioned a few times. Overall the food was delicious, the atmosphere was cool but I was not a fan of the service",

The most disappointing part of the entire experience was the service. It wasn't our server but it was the spend at which the would arrived.

Also had a smoked bourbon drink. It was good, but not Smokey enough. The atmosphere is pretty cool and the service was good. We finished the meal with a carrot cake and that was the best thing in the restaurant. Fun time, but was hoping to be blown away.",

I went in knowing exactly what I wanted. I was ready for the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli. I barely looked at the menu past that because I wasn't changing my mind. When we first sat down we were told that it was tapas style and to order 5-7 things for the two of us. That didn't work for my budget though so I started with only the ravioli and decided I would go from there. I'm glad I did because I actually didn't need anything else - other than maybe a bajillion more of those ravioli and dessert. I'm kind of joking. While I wanted to order another round of ravioli, I really was quite satisfied with the one order I received.  We also ordered the mini strawberry shortcake for dessert and they were so incredibly good. The waiter didn't recommend them, but I do. They were a nice light dessert and perfectly sweet.",

Our service was great, though the food took its time..  I will say that the portions are teeeeny. At one point, my friend and I wanted to laugh at how small the ahi tuna tacos were at the price they were at. We ordered the sashimi, which was delicious. I got the salmon for my entree, and this was delicious as well though a bit overdone. My friend ordered the cavatelli, and this was quite tasty too. Our drinks- ODB were super refreshing with this meal.  For our birthdays, the waitress brought out these absolutely delicious cake pops. We boxed them up after trying one, and I proceeded to have the saved one the next night. We had a great overall dining experience before a night out in Vegas- loved it!",

    "text": "Prepare your wallets and your earbuds. Beauty & Essex is a very ~Vegas~ experience. Similar to my sentiments on Vegas in general, I believe Beauty & Essex is more of a come-once-to-experience-it kind of place.   After stumbling through a very high-end jewelry/art storefront, we found the restaurant. On a Saturday night around 7:30, my friend and I had no trouble getting a table for two.  The interior is extremely hip and the place seemed huge. We were seated and were immediately surprised by how loud the place was. It was a little difficult to hold a conversation across the table because it was difficult to hear each other.  We decided to keep the meal light (after seeing the prices OUCH) and ordered some appetizers to share:   Grilled cheese, smoked bacon tomato soup dumplings:  This item seems to be a restaurant favorite, as most people had it on their table. It was, to be honest, okay. It was pretty much exactly what it sounds like, nothing quite exceptional or unique. It's also a little much for a table of two, definitely designed for larger parties.   Bao Buns: These have to be ordered one at a time. The bread to meat ratio was very off, so I ended up taking the top half of my bread off so I could get a better taste of the flavors. My bun was also extremely underdressed, compared to my friend's which seemed to have more sauce on it.   Korean fried chicken and kimchi: These bite-size chicken pieces were probably my favorite. I was worried because it was advertised to be on a bed of kimchi cucumber salad, and I am not a fan of kimchi, but the salad was extremely mild and I was able to eat the cucumbers.   Lastly, the common thread between everything we ordered which really knocked my experience down to a two star, was that EVERYTHING CAME OUT COLD! Our food arrived on the table about 2-3 minutes after we ordered. It was extremely clear that the kitchen already had the items prepared. I was extremely dissappointed to be paying top dollar for cold food...",

We had the tomahawk it was great and the grilled cheese dumplings that everyone raves about I personally thought they weren't anything worth talking about and arrived to the table cold. I definitely had better service the first time we ate there. I would say this time everything was just okay.",

    "text": "Came here to celebrate my boyfriend's 21st birthday and we were left full and speechless.  I had heard amazing reviews for the LA location of this restaurant so I knew this was somewhere I had to go when I went to Vegas. I made my reservation through OpenTable which was a breeze itself. All I had to do was pick the date I would be going, how many people, and they gave me time options from there. Our Vegas trip was a surprise for my boyfriend so he didn't know any of the plans I had made for us for the weekend, so walking up to the front of the restaurant (through the pawn shop) my boyfriend was very concerned and thought I had the wrong place hahaha. I had him open the door that switches us from the shop into the restaurant and his eyes lit up of amazement. Such a small little detail of the dinner but really set the tone for the night.  Our waitress was very welcoming and told us the ways of the road, she suggested to us that we order around 6-8 dishes since they are sharing plates and that's what we did. Out of everything we ordered, my favorites were the mac n cheese, grilled cheese dumplings, and the bao buns. Of those though, that mac n cheese was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten in my life. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was so rich and creamy and cheesy, and the addition of the egg on top really made it that much more decadent.  Lastly, I made a quick note in our reservation that we were going to be celebrating a birthday so at the end of our meal our waitress surprised my boyfriend with a little birthday dessert. The dessert was three flourless chocolate cake cake-pops that were I think was the best flourless chocolate cake(my fav dessert) I had ever had. Super yummy and very thoughtful, my boyfriend felt very special this evening. The overall service we received during this meal was amazing, our waters were never half full because they were always being topped off, any dirty dishes were cleared from our table the second we were finished, and everyone was just very friendly and kind as a whole. This place was such a great dining experience and it without a doubt a place everyone needs to try at least once.",

The ONLY complaint I have is that they sat a couple with a baby at the table across from us and the baby screeched and cried for the last third of our meal. (Who brings their under-one-year-old baby to an upscale restaurant in Vegas at 8 PM at night, really.)  Anyway, that's not really the restaurant's fault, and before the screeching child, I did love the ambiance. (The fact that you enter through a[n upscale] pawn shop is also very cool.)  We were a group of four and in the end each shelled out just under $100 for 2-3 drinks each and more than enough to eat. My favorites were the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings and the mac-and-cheese, though all of the dishes I tried were awesome as well, and they brought me truffles for my birthday, which was also a plus :) There were definitely a few menu items that I didn't get to try, too, so I'm definitely planning on going back next time I'm in Vegas.",

This is on the third floor of the cosmopolitan, directly off the elevators!   The prices are very expensive, and the portions are average to small. As long as you know what you are getting into and wanting to splurge a little, this place is 10/10. It is a dark atmosphere so it was a little hard to read the menu.   I got the beauty tonic cocktail, it was a little strong from my liking but it was well made. For eats, I got the herb chicken and the Asian chicken dumplings! Defiantly recommend these dumplings they were amazing!!   As a local though, I would not go here again just every weekend UNLESS I had the reason to have a fancy night out. I would recommend it that you must try this place out though since you can't beat the fun atmosphere and vibe. And well who doesn't want to go to a place where you enter in a guitar shop at first?!?",

The man attending the hostess table was kind, but the two ladies with him were absolutely miserable with their jobs. The place was beautiful, tried an overrated whisky apple drink that was just alright... not much more I can say. For such an \"upscale\" restaurant, customer service should come first!!!",

The food is also excellent, and I was able to try their famed grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings (not to be missed), the poke wonton tacos, and other shared items. A fun experience overall!.",

Lol The restaurant entrance is through the pawn shop (which is so cool)! The lounge seemed like an easy choice since it was Friday night and we had no reservation.  Our party of six enjoyed cocktails and fantastic music from the dj! (Thank you for playing every request!) We ordered lots of appetizers--sliders, flatbread, grilled cheese/tomato soup, wedge salad, etc.  All were delicious!!! Everything was flowing nicely and the apps came out evenly spaced...other than the sliders.  We watched plates upon plates of sliders go by to other tables.  After what seemed like too long, I gingerly asked if they were coming and was assured they were on their way.  70 minutes after ordering, I finally had to go ask the very nice manager who shared my concern.  Obviously there had been a mistake, but 70 minutes is just too long.  They came out, but just plain and simply too late.  The manager took them off the bill without even having to ask and honestly, we still left happy! My only comment to the darling waitress: just tell us that a mistake happened.  We would've ordered something else.  Otherwise, a fabulous place and I can't wait to go back (and I won't order the sliders!). Lol",

    "text": "I have found my new favorite dining experience in Las Vegas, and it is in Beauty & Essex.  You can see the bright yellow sign from the strip off the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, but what you'll find on the inside is culinary genius.  If tapas is your game, then Beauty & Essex is your place!  From the array of photos below, you can see that plates are small but shareable to the extreme.  We split about 9ish dishes between the 4 of us, 2 desserts and 2 rounds of drinks.  Needless to say, we ran up a hefty tab but it's the price you pay for amazing food and drink.  Let's break it down with food first: -Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -- probably my favorite of the tapas we had.  Cute little wonton tacos with fresh ahi tuna poke inside and a drizzle of wasabi kewpie on top.  Packed with flavor and a nice little punch -East & West Coast Oysters -- I forgot the \"East Coast\" ones but the West Coast oysters were the kumamotos (my fave), so needless to say they were good.  There was a mignonette served with it but it was too icy for my liking. -Greek Toast -- one of the simplist dishes we had, but super tasty.  Usually comes in a serving of 3 pieces, but our waiter was nice enough to get 4 so everyone could try.  Fresh veggies and flavors piled on and easy to eat -\"Chile Relleno\" Empanadas -- kinda heavy on the cheese, but I love me some Manchego so I didn't mind all too much!  I wish there was a tad bit more jalapeno-lime crema on top, but the tiny dot was enough to get the idea of the flavor -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings -- We almost didn't order these, but I'm really glad we did!!!  The waiter suggested one of the dumplings no matter what, so we opted for this.  Served on spoon, the tomato soup isn't piping hot making it easy to eat.  The culimination of all your favorite things into one spoon-sized bite was incredible. -Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta -- a very very safe choice for something with great flavors.  Wish it was a tad bit crispier but otherwise very tasy.  Very easy to share and even if you eat like a bird, enough for one person to have. -Pressed Jerk-Spiced Chicken -- probably my least favorite dish.  Not because it was bad but because jerk spice is not my favorite thing.  I'd probably opt for the meatballs next time. -Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings -- don't care for onion rings, but these were bomb!!  The sambal ketchup makes them oh so tasty!  They are huge and super filling too. -Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops -- I had a bite out of this because the guys got it to share.  Tender and pink, the medium rare lamb chops were tasty with a nice glaze on top. -Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme -KYGO Cloud Nine \"S'mores\" -- The desserts were honestly larger than any of the tapas.  The S'mores was a little too sweet for my liking but the marshmallow whip on top was delectable!!  Now for drinks: -Earl the Pearl -- a super strong tea taste to this one, so if tea is not up your alley don't bother.  I thought it was a good drink to have while you were eating because of all the subtleties to avoid washing out the flavor of the foods. -Bubbles & Berries -- if you're into more sweet this is for you.  At first it seems a little intimidating (champagne, vodka AND st. germain) but it's not as strong as you'd think.  Loved having it after our meal as something sweet on my palette.  SO.  If the menu doesn't win you over, I hope this does.  It doesn't hurt that the staff is AMAZING and the restaurant itself is gorgeous. Just do yourself a favor and eat here.",

The cocktails cost $17 which is average for a nice place in Vegas. Ordering was difficult since the waitress told us to order 2-3 small plates per person at the table and it was WAY too much food. Very difficult ordering with a group of 7 people. Cost came out to about $75 per person which was fair for the food we received. The best thing about this place is the ambience of the entire restaurant and pawn shop as you enter.",

They obviously know their clientele....its super packed on a Wednesday night! Cocktails are very good. My Manhattan Lemon was delicious and potent. Its all about tapas here.Food is to be shared. Small plates of mac and cheese, short ribs...grilled cheese bacon tomato soup dumplings..roast mushroom pizzetta...mexican street corn ravioli and molasses glazed pork belly. Myself and my wife as well as my two adult children enjoyed the food..all very tasty. I honestly believe our waitress(who was very good)...seemed intent on jacking up our bill. she had lots of food suggestions. portions are small,but pricey.

I have been to the New York location and loved it and the Vegas spot just doesn't quite hold up.    We were a little late for our reservation so I called ahead of time and made it within our 15 minute grace period.  I understand that it is busy and that we were late.  However - we were obviously being hustled out of there by our waitstaff.  We ordered drinks, and tried a number of different items on the menu.  We had the Thai Shrimp and the Scallops and they both had the exact same slaw underneath them which was a little disappointing as the flavors were exactly the same.  We also tried the onion rings which were exactly what you'd expect and had the double barrelled pork chop which the sauce on top was bitter and acidic.    Overall the menu was a little hard to order as things aren't really in a certain style or theme.  The meal was just not very cohesive and easy to put together things that went well together.    The waitress at the end of the meal basically said do you even want anything off of the dessert menu?  Never offered another drink or coffee...we were in and out in under an hour.  It was not a relaxing or comfortable dinner.",

I've walked by their facade countless times but never once thought that beyond the displays of jewelry, purses, guitars that there's a hidden restaurant inside. Quite cool I'd say. I felt very Bond-esque.  The decor is unique and it has a very mysterious lair-y vibe. Very interesting. But let's move on to the food!  I love tapas! It's the main reason I'm going to Spain soon. I travel for food! But I digress. I started with littleneck clams on the half shell. Although I prefer my oysters my SO thoroughly loved it and he hates oysters. So it's up to your preference I guess. Next we had the grilled cheese dumplings served on individual soup spoons laying atop flavorful tomato soup! It's just as delicious as it looks. My favorite dish of the night happens to be the Tomato Tartare. Now it's interesting because tartares are usually made of meat but in this case, it's just the good 'ol tomatoes. I admit I got it because the pics looked beautiful. Don't judge me! I expected to hate it then pass it on to my SO to finish (hehehe) but I fell in love with it instead. It was packed full of flavor and very pretty to look at as well. It also looked more like beef tartare in person!  We ended with some Reverse S'mores Bites which was perfect. My favorite part of the s'mores was the meringue. So gooey... yum! 10/10 would dine here again.",

He brought us two orders of empanadas when we only ordered one. We ate them anyway because we were starving lol... also kept asking weird questions about our order we already told him.

The management really hooked it up and gave us a free dinner I believe I can't recall exactly but they really did take care of us. But at the end of the day it's kind of annoying when you can't eat your meal---but they totally made it up to us. I really loved this place on second and third try,  food is great I love their tuna tacos and salads!  Great atmosphere-- great for a date and also it's good to have a birthday here, or just have friends there for a small party. I would recommend just getting a seat closer to the middle dining area and enjoying The busy atmosphere of it all. I can't wait to come back! Great tip is that on Mondays they have Key night  so they have two-for-one drinks I believe :-)",

You enter through a pawnshop and once your eyes adjust to the darkness, you can see that this place is beautiful in an illicit sort-of way, dark, intimate, and sexy.  No doubt there's a lot of footsie going on under the tables here, and if you think about it, after a couple of the excellent cocktails, you'll be doing it too for sure.  There are imaginative cocktails and the menu is filled with items to be shared.  The chef's favorites are pulled together as a single prix-fixe meal - for simplicity, and because we couldn't hear the waiter (too loud) or read the menu (too dark), we chose that option.    In general the food was quite good.  Portions were adequate and we did not leave the restaurant hungry.",

We called a couple of hours in advance to make a reservation for Thursday at 7:15pm. We were sat as soon as we arrived and the front desk staff acknowledged that it was my husbands birthday. Which was sweet since they all wished him a happy birthday. They sat us in a spacious booth. Our waiter Frank was super super attentive and knowledgeable. Our glasses were never empty and our food arrived fairly quickly. We ordered the Cesar toast, k town bao burgers, grilled cheese smoked bacon dumplings, Mediterranean cauliflower and the chicken meatballs and it was SO delish!! The bill was 115 minus tip which is nothing for two people that ordered that much + we had a few virgin drinks that were amazing as well. All in all I would definitely love to come back!",

    "text": "From the ambiance to the staff to the actual food, the entire experience was amazing. A bit on the pricey side, but it's sure worth it for a date night or a tourist spot.  When you first see the restaurant, you might get a little confused. The front of the restaurant is a pawn/jewelry shop of sorts that make you question if you are at the right place. You entire this shop and there is a door in the back (which looks like an employee entrance) that leads to the main restaurant. The restaurant is dimly lit with different shaped mirrors all around the walls; it has the ambiance of an old-time European royal's mansion.   We started off the night with drinks. I had a Ruby Iced Tea, a virgin cocktail, which was highly refreshing. The red currant tea was flavorful and the lemon juice gave it the hint of acidity that the drink needed. The mint leaves also gave the drink it the refreshing kick it needed, especially with the weather being over 100 degrees outside.  Most of the plates here are served tapas style, so our table of four got a total of 7 plates and 2 desserts. To start the night off, we had a half dozen East and West Coast Oysters. The oysters may have been small in size, but they were fresh. Next, the Steak Toast came out. This had a slight kick to it from the serrano pepper. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, allowing it to be juicy. It was lightly seasoned, allowing the Malaysian spices to be the star.   As the night went on, we had Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops, Short Rib Mac & Cheese, and Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta. The lamb chops were also medium rare and was very tender and juicy. It  had a delicious wine glaze and was served over creamy grits. The lamb cut like butter and was flavorful on its own, but the glaze accentuated the natural flavors of the lamb. The grits gave a different texture to the dish, which it needed. The Mac & Cheese was delicious; though it was not the best I've ever had, it was still good. It was filled with chunks of short rib, not just small, thin shreds, which was impressive. The Mac & Cheese tasted like it was made of a Parmesan base, with hints of truffle oil. With the creaminess of the Mac & Cheese, the cornbread crust that topped it gave it a different texture that the dish needed. The Mushroom Pizzetta was also very tasty; the crust had a nice crunch with juicy mushrooms that topped it.  After these 5 dishes, we were still hungry, so we got BBQ fries and Garganelli. These two dishes were both mediocre. The fries were heavily seasoned, making it hard to eat many of them at the same time. The Garganelli's sauce was very rich and sweet; and though I like meat sauces, this sauce had too much meat since it felt like there was more meat than pasta.   To finish the night off, we had \"les nyc\" Doughnuts, which were fried perfectly and not too sweet. It came with caramel, chocolate, and berry sauces. The caramel and chocolate sauces were good and very rich and sweet, while the berry was lighter and did not overpower the flavors of the doughnut. We also had the Root Beer Shots, which was dangerously good because it tasted like a regular root beer float.  All in all, the entire experience was amazing. Though some of the foods had some short comings, most of the food we ate were delicious.",

They laced the table with an assortment of different finger foods and top grade drinks.   The meal started off with a few glasses of champagne. Then they served us our favorite vodka mixed drinks. After the drink service, the food started pouring in. The first thing on the menu was a freshly prepared Cobb salad. The salad was loaded with fresh mixed greens and delicious rustic flavors. Once I was done with my salad, they served me a chicken parmesan flatbread. The chicken was crispy and the flatbread was laced with a flavorful tomato sauce. Then came tuna tar tar tacos. The tacos were loaded with a mix of flavors. It was sweet and salty. The soy sauce added a bitter yet salty kick. The crunchy taco shell was glazed with a sweet coating. The meal ended with jumbo glazed shrimp. The shrimp was so fresh and lacked all fishy smell. I do want to mention that the food we selected was super girly and made the girls night out even more girly and sexy than we anticipated.   The service was fast, professional and intimate. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for great food and great music.   When I went Timmy trumpet graced us with his music and presence. His musical talent was radiating throughout the whole restaurant. He let off great vibes!   May I add, before you enter the hidden door leading to the actual restaurant, you walk into a classy pawn shop displaying beautiful pieces of jewelry and gizmos and gadgets.",

    "text": "The low score is strictly food based. The service, ambience, and uniqueness of the restaurant were excellent. You almost feel like you're walking into a pawn shop when you first walk in, but then you walk through this section and end up in a vibrant bar area. The restaurant area is past the bar. The environment is definitely Vegas like, with music and just the right amount of lighting. People were dressed up and the vibe was very hip and upscale.   We had reservations and were sat down at our table right away at 8pm on a Friday night. The server and assisting staff were extremely courteous, professional, and attentive. The service was truly excellent.     The food was an entirely different experience though. My wife and I both had the filet, along with a cauliflower dish and a broccoli dish. You literally could not taste the actual food itself because everything was completely over seasoned.   What they did to the filet was borderline criminal. It had this thick barbecue seasoning rub all over it, like what you might to do a brisket before smoking it for three hours. Except the filet was grilled, causing this barbecue rub to caramelize. The flavor was overwhelming, and not in a good way. They also sliced the filet before serving it, causing all the juices to flow out before it even hit my plate. What was served were slices of dry meat that tasted like over seasoned barbecue potato chips. This is not an exaggeration at all.   The same thing with both the cauliflower and broccoli. The cauliflower also had a thick seasoning poured all over it, completely masking the natural flavor of the vegetable and leaving your mouth dry. The broccoli tasted like the chef tried to pour salt on it, but the lid came off and the entire container of salt fell all over it. It was truly perplexing why they felt the need to put such an incredible amount of seasoning on everything.   My wife and I had been to Vegas several times before, but we were there with my brother and his wife, and this was their first night ever in Vegas. We felt bad that this was their first dining experience.",

While we enjoyed the first plate, the subsequent plates came in such rapid fashion that many got cold and tasteless. When I told our server, he wasn't prepared to handle the complaint. He sent over a floor manager who seemed equally ill-equipped to handle. Quite honestly it was a bummer...we were really excited!

The ones that really stood out were the sashimi and the tuna tar tar tacos.  Our server was incredibly attentive and very friendly.  We were incredibly happy with the food and service.  The ambiance is really cool too.  This is a must try.  It's fun and tasty and doesn't leave you feeling completely gross and bloated.  I couldn't recommend this place more.",

While I wouldn't recommend this as a date spot (the atmosphere is loud with great music), again, it is perfect for a group to celebrate any special event, or a great pre or post event spot. There is a great tasting menu; items include an exquisite choice of oysters, dumplings, mini artesian tacos and raviolis, and great individual dishes. The food is so rich and delicious! We came here before a Duran Duran concert, and the entire evening was wonderful!",

    "text": "I love finding new restaurants on my travel adventures. When in Las Vegas, I had some down time by myself & stumbled upon this place. Actually saw it listed on a hotel marquee, checked out the menu, made reservations,  and walked in. This place was breath taking. Upon walking in I was greeted by 2 ladies in what appeared to be a pawn shop atmosphere. The checkered floor enhanced the ecclectic decor which included pendants, knick knacks, and guitars on the wall. This definitely seemed to be a fun place to eat. When I was ushered through the door to enter the restaurant... I was blown away!!! Once inside a beautiful hostess counter was noticed with  beautiful mirrors & fresh flowers. All I could do was simply smile. This was not casual dining but a fine dining experience for sure. The host ushered me down a hallway filled with antique mirrors as I noticed the glimmering chandeliers in the dining area.  Well after being seated and taking it all in, a server came over and was clearly knowledgeable about the menu. While I was hungry, but not famished, I only wanted a light meal. My server suggested I try the grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato dumplings. While I am not a grilled cheese fan, this dish was heavenly! The dish was served with bacon wrapped around the grilled cheese & tomato dumpling! The perfect blend of savory with a hint of salty had my taste buds dancing. This dish was served on 4 spoons which were beautifully placed on a rectangular dish. Next I had the Thai style deep fried shrimp served with a mango slaw. The shrimp were cooked to perfection & the sauce it was served with was a great combination of spicy & sweet.  This hidden gem was a great find & awesome experience! When in Vegas if you want your tastebuds to be tantalized as you experience a foodie's delight... look no further!",

    "text": "I have been to the original B & E in NYC at least 7 times so have something to compare to. It was not like the original, in short I will say this felt like a fake version of the real deal in New York made to fill the masses that pour through the door for the \"experience\". Quantity over quality for sure.    From the outside yes, it does look impressive and the inside has a somewhat similar vibe aesthetically speaking, thats it. The food was a far cry from the original, it was unsatisfying, cheap, tasteless and poorly executed with the experience going no further than a \"nice\" appearance. I feel terrible to say this but the food quality was a dressed up version of I HOP, if not even worse. If you want to know why keep reading why 4 people (2 from New York  and 2 from San Diego) left with more than 50% food on their plates after paying a $400 bill.   My husband and I ordered 1 porkchop entree and 24 oz bone in steak.  For sides we had the mac N cheese, bone marrow shots, and shishito peppers.   Friends Ordered steak, scallops and mac N cheese.    The food:  1. My steak was large, the portion is huge it is. They cooked it well I asked for medium but the meat was not good quality. It felt like i kept chewing and chewing and just never chewed it out. I spat the majority out in my napkin because it was too tough to swallow.  2. My husband said the same of his pork chop, it was undercooked and the meat was chewy, he isn't a complainer as I am not either so we ate the majority left unsatisfied.  3. We shared the mac N cheese, which everyone at the table had the same thing to say, you can make a better KRAFT box at home.  It was not el dente and felt a bit undercooked, which is not as big of a problem as it was lacking flavor.  I love carbs and rarely \"splurge\" on them but it was not cheesy it wasn't creamy it was somewhat dry with some sort of crumbs on the top. Literally took 2-3 bites and was done. 2 dishes were left almost untouched by all 4 of us. Disappointment.  4. My friends steak came cold, literally, i touched it. He ordered medium like me and it was not even room temperature.  He waited 10 mins for replacement and had to watch us all eat.  Not fun.  5. We ordered the Marrow appies, those were amazing, amazing! you get 3 and a lot so definitely recommend, especially with a whiskey shot but my husband asked for extra crispy bread because so little came with it, they said ok and no bread ever arrived. Annoying. 6. Drinks, they were O K, mixed review. I thought the cheap celery salt added to the mezcal drink was not good. It destroyed the flavor of a good cocktail. if you order it, ask for no celery salt, it devalues the drink. 7. The shishito peppers, you get a lot, but again like the rest of the food it lacked flavor. They were cooked well the texture was good but the flavor was just off. It could have been a little savory or sour? adding something to take it to the next level, but they tasted BLAH. Another dish we did not finish.  Atmosphere  This is Vegas, which of course doesn't disappoint so definitely amazing dark vibe, decoration is nice (again not as good as NY), great place to grab a drink at the beginning at the bar, and then dine in the back afterwards. Great place for a date or to start your night in terms of vibe and getting you in the mood.   In the end we were very unsatisfied, and felt cheated and robbed walking away.  I was embarrassed to have recommended this as the IT place to dine (given my previous experience, you can refer to my review at the NY location)   TO BEAUTY AND ESSEX MANAGEMENT: if you message me that you have made changes because of my review I will update it that I have been messaged and my complaints have been actioned in fairness.",

    "text": "I came here last night with a group of 5 for my friend's birthday. We had reservations, but our table was not yet ready when we arrived. So we sat in the lounge waiting for the pager to vibrate. After 20 minutes, one of my friends asked about the status of our table. The man at the front desk told my friend that it was still not ready, but gave us a card for a comp'd round of drinks for the table. That made the wait not a problem at all! I had the Emerald Gimlet and it was delicious! It's like drinking a refreshing green juice, and then next thing you know, you're tipsy! After the first one, we kept ordering it with added jalapenos...omg...spicy, sassy, and refreshing!  When we were sat at our table, the one problem we did have was the noise level. I don't know if it's the way the room was built or if the people dining that night were just extra loud, but it was LOUD. It was difficult to hear each other at our own table over the surrounding conversations.   Our server told us that for a group of our size, she would normally recommend about 8-10 dishes to share. We chuckled a little at this thought because we already knew we were going to surpass that number. I kid you not; we ordered just about one of every item except the oysters. My absolute favorites were the avocado toast, mushroom pizza, and Mexican corn ravioli! Everything we ordered was full of flavor and an array of textures.  To end our meal, we discreetly ordered a huge dessert platter for our friend's birthday. Our server put the candles we bought on the platter, and brought the beautiful presentation out singing. The birthday girl was pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, it was an AMAZING dinner experience!",

Our server was exceptional - attentive, thoughtful, helpful, and funny. She made sure we had enough - and the right food - and made certain that our drinks came out perfectly! Everything we ate was awesome (which was almost the entire menu) but the crowd favorites were definitely the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings and the chicken meatballs. The speakeasy ambience made it a great place to celebrate a birthday or just a fun night out! Would highly recommend and can't wait to go to the LA location",

Food: -Tomato and Creamy Burrata: I am a hugeeee burrata lover but unfortunately this was just okay. It was definitely missing something, maybe a pesto or type of sauce to brighten the dish overall  -Caesar Toast: I LOVED this- the lettuce was perfectly dressed and the crispy chicken skin crumbles elevated this completely, highly recommend -Grilled Cheese Dumplings: my coworkers felt this was the best dish of the night. I personally thought it was decent but was pretty basic flavors, nothing exceptional -Roasted Bone Marrow: I am also a huge lover of bone marrow and this was perfectly cooked. we could have easily eaten a whole plate to ourselves it was so good. definitely recommend to order- the onions, salt and parsley were perfect to brighten it up -Tomahawk Steak: I had high expectations for the steak but they weren't totally met. The steak was definitely good and medium but it wasn't as buttery or melt in your mouth as I was hoping for. the side sauces were a nice touch and added good flavor  -Tiramisu Sundae: heavily on the coffee flavors but overall well prepared",

Turn the lights up, just a smidge. It was so dim, it was a real buzz kill. It honestly made us so sleepy. If you're looking for a quiet place for dinner, this is not the place. It's very loud for such a dark place. The dress code: I saw every thing from jeans and tank tops to very formal wear.  The food was alright. Out of everything I ordered, The best item I tried was the Mexican corn ravioli. Tasted like elotes. Everything was served tapas style, so just order a bunch of stuff and share it.  Our waiter was very attentive which is appreciated, and they gave us stamps to get in to marquee night club for free. Over all a nice place to try our, but not a \"must go eat\" while in Vegas.",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is the type of restaurant that speaks to me - cool cocktails, an eclectic menu, a chic, swarthy vibe. And with three locations in these United States, it was only a matter of time until I got myself a seat in one. Odds, you might think, would be on their Hollywood outpost, only some 30 minutes away without LA traffic getting in the way. But over the last year and a half, when it comes to visits by me, Hollywood is losing 0-3-2 respectively to Vegas and New York (homes to the other Beauty & Essex locations). So my first B&E experience happened in the desert foodie mecca that is The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas, a (pricey) roll of the dice that left me a winner.  You enter B&E as a customer of their pseudo pawnshop, able to purchase jewelry, guitars, or intergalactic-themed tchotchkes before (or after) dining. Skipping past the display cases, you enter into the restaurant's small lobby, speakeasy reminiscent. Once inside, you're bathed in warming hip-hop and laughter and quick conversations. A cocktail was calling my name as soon as I sat. Any of their options would've done, but I went for the Beauty Elixir, hopeful its ingredients might wash away the circles under my eyes or scrub away laugh lines. These ingredients included rose and strawberries, cucumber and gin. A sultry combination, it thrilled and delighted and relaxed, the way a Vegas cocktail should. The circles under my eyes remained.  After drinks came the arduous task of whittling down the healthy list of tapas-sized dishes I wanted to try. A big party might have helped here, a group asking for a little of everything. But with just me and hus-bae, we'd have to make some tough decisions.  Ordering a few choices I just couldn't pass up, we ended up taking home a couple boxes of vittles that just couldn't be forced down (though we did manage to sacrifice a couple bites for dessert).  At the end, I call it an exceptional dinner date, an experience I'd love to repeat when the time and pocketbook can make it happen (yes, I would have loved to call FEMA for recompense of all the damage done with my bank card). Beauty & Essex is just one of the reasons why Vegas its little Cosmopolitan gem are something lovely.  kale & apple salad - Yippee Yahoo-ey \"chile relleno\" empanadas - Yippee Skippy thai style deep-fried shrimp - Yay crispy vidalia onion rings - Yip Yip Hooray oven braised chicken meatballs - Yip mexican street corn ravioli - Yippee Dippy Skoo peanut butter pie sundae - Yay Yay Yay",

Once entering through the big door (be careful for people exiting from the other side) you are embraced into a huge restaurant that appears from essentially no where.

We also stated that we were in a rush too but nothing happened.   Grilled cheese dumplings were creative but a no from me. You get 8 of them so portion wise it's really great but still wasn't enough for me to say I'd order it again.   The Mexican Street Corn Ravioli was top notch, really really great!   The bao burgers were really good too! $8 is a steep price to pay per bun but they were good!   The bone marrow, tuna poke and yellowtail sashimi were all stand points as wells",

Our party ordered around 5-6 items to share as well as the 34oz Tomahawk rib-eye.   Things that blew my mind (and my taste-budssss!!!): Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Tomato soup Dumplings.. Oven Braised chicken meatballs..  We didn't think the Tomahawk was anything overly special...  When in Vegas I will definitely stop by again!!",

He was very detailed and excited about describing the cocktails to us. We told him we wanted to eat here at B &E and he said we should swing by for dessert if we still have room after dinner. Well we took his advice and came by later that evening and got the Strawberry lemon shortcake he recommended. Super good! If the rest of the staff and food is as good as we got at the bar.... I can't wait to go back for dinner.",

    "text": "In town for a seminar for Husband, this was my one request.  To experience B&E!  I had admired all the food pics and admired the inventive menu...could picture my five-star review.... couldn't wait for it!  Finally made it to the Cosmopolitan on Sunday night right after they opened, feeling clever that I knew to look for a pawn shop.  What I didn't know was, GO through it.  Don't expect a pawn shop employee to be helpful and tell you to go through the closed door when you say you're there for dinner. (Gal simply said \"okay\" when we said we were hoping to dine). Soooo...TIP: walk in the pawn shop, turn to your left and open the door.   (you're welcome!)  Fortunately we were greeted a little more warmly at the hostess stand, and brought to a small two-top just inside the dining room near the bar, which meant one of us had our back to the dining room. Not overly comfortable, especially considering the place was pretty empty. Now I'm not the most observant human being on the planet, but I couldn't help but notice one of my forks had a big glob of something clinging to it.  Pointed it out to our Server and he removed it with a \"sorry\", but didn't replace it.  We were fine with tap water.  Husband is a Bourbon guy, so he ordered: The Woodsman:  Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Allspice Dram, Maple Syrup, Lemon, Muddled Pears, while I went with a Cabernet.  Both were quite good, which was a good thing as we were $33 committed at this point.  Two items I wanted to try after having seen all the pics were the tomato soup dumplings and the french onion ones.  Well they aren't doing the french onion ones anymore.  Wah!   But fortunately the tomato soup ones are still on the menu. That was a no-brainer must-try for me.  Surprisingly, Husband wanted us to try the Bone Marrow.  (surprising because he doesn't eat meat on bones, so I assumed he would never want to try the inside of bones).  And the Thai Shrimp sounded really good, so we decided to start with those three.  Loved that our Server asked if we were in any hurry or if he could put the dishes in to come out one at a time.  No hurry for us.  The moment I'd been waiting for arrived...the dumplings came out first.  Beautiful presentation on the soup spoons, but... a bit hard to eat.  After awkwardly throwing a whole one in my mouth, I got smart and cut the other two with a knife.  Never did taste the smoked bacon, but they were good.  $18 good?  Maybe?   Somewhere around this point, the young guy pouring water managed to dump some in Husband's lap.  Oops.  Another \"sorry\".    So, the Marrow arrives, and my silverware had been cleared after the dumplings.  I had to ask for more.  All of the components worked beautifully together...the jam, salt, and teeny bit of greens.  There was just enough for the six small pieces of grilled bread.  Good, but again...$19 good?  We were still eating the marrow when the shrimp arrived. Five beautiful shrimp, lightly battered, nice Thai flavor with a small salad underneath.  Slightly spicy.  Very good, but it didn't go with the marrow (remember, no hurry and one at a time?) and for $22...well...maybe worth it?  Ready for dessert, and knowing my obsession with fried dough, Husband ordered the Doughnuts for us.  We also each got a cup of decaf.  The doughnuts arrived before our coffee  (not the order we would have preferred).  They are round large doughnut holes with cinnamon sugar and three dipping sauces...chocolate, caramel and berry.  The caramel was both of our favorites.  We enjoyed it, but would have enjoyed it a lot more at half the $14 price.  Coffee was good and surprise-surprise not crazy expensive at $3.50 each.  Although we were not offered a  refill.  Two more things that we weren't crazy about...no restrooms in the place.  Yes, I know that's not unusual for Vegas, but for a restaurant of this caliber?  And the other thing that got annoying was the repetitive spiel that the Servers all use.  Tables are close enough together so we couldn't help but hear them recommending how many dishes to order, etc. etc.  Good to be trained on the selling aspect, but more attention to detail like silverware, and caring if you've gotten a lap full of water might be important also.  Yes I realize this is Vegas and the Strip and the Cosmopolitan, and we expected high prices, have happily paid them in the past for celebrity chef experiences, but this time the experience, especially considering the service, didn't warrant them.   Which is why the 5-star review I was sure I was going to write, is a 3-star.  A-ok.",

You first enter by walking into a pawn shop, which then has a door at the back of the store which leads to the actual restaurant. Such a cool concept! The restaurant vibe is very fun and chic, with dim lights and music and the restaurant is always busy!   For the most part, all the plates are sharing dishes which makes it great for a group! I went to the Vegas location for bachelorette party, and while some dishes only came with 4 or 5 pieces, being a party of 6 they were able just to add another piece!     Food recommendations:  - Caesar Toast (creamy garlic, crispy chicken skin) - Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings ~THESE ARE A MUST!!~ we got 2 orders of them because they are just so delicious!! - Asian Chicken & Dumplings  - K - Town Bao Burgers - Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos",

I had the Oaxaca old fashion and it was divine,  mezcal and I revisited an old affair we once had.

For a chef seen on Chopped that holds high standards for the food, I was sadly let down and he would have been chopped, especially for the prices charged, which I have no problem paying for if great high quality food!  I read a few reviews on Yelp before going in. We started with the Yellowtail sashimi: delicious! We then moved to the Greek toast: good, yet not the best I have had. We then moved to the bone marrow with marmalade: bone marrow very salty yet overall a very mediocre and not a memorable dish... very disappointing. We ordered the grilled cheese with bacon dumplings and tomato soup: it did not taste anything like grilled cheese and the tomato soup tasted more like chef boy-r-d ravioli sauce. Just no!!!  Underwhelming. We tried the onion rings and do not get the hype... not better than anywhere else yet overpriced. Our waitress recommended the Brussels sprouts: why???? They were horrible, and I like Brussel sprouts! We barely touched any of it as it was awful. Our last two dishes were the Thai chicken main course: delicious!!! The other was the scallops: again, why the hype? They were more bland and boring than yummy.  We did not bother getting dessert because we did not want to face more disappointment.  You enter the restaurant by going through a pawn shop. The restaurant is very pretty and the service is friendly, but a major tip is the following: each waiter told their table what their favorite things are and that we should order it... don't listen!!! Our waitress had horrible recommendations!  The food is mostly average, some really bad and some really good. Overall, just blah. I would not recommend it at current prices... way too many places that are way better in Vegas for that price.",

Our waiter, Ian, was adorable and informed. Thought we had found a new spot to add to our Vegas restaurants, but food wise it just wasn't amazing. The atmosphere sets you up for great food as you watch little plates and spoons circulate the room. I mean, presentation is everything right? But the food misses a note across your pallet. It's not that it's bad... But it lacks heat, acid, and most importantly, salt.  Quite simply, the food just doesn't pop in your mouth with tons of flavor.  We really wanted to like it and kept ordering stuff, but it was just a fizzle... What it boils down to is the food does not equate with the bill or the atmosphere. So come for drinks, a few little bites, dress cute... but know you are just there for the scene.",

They gave good suggestions on what to order. Highly recommend the yellow tail sashimi that was flavor town. We also ordered the short rib Mac and cheese and grilled cheese tomato dumplings. We got the dumplings because it was the most popular on the menu.  The short rib Mac was missing some beef barely got any. They were tasty, I wouldn't go back just for those dishes. It was quite pricy for these small tapas. We were in at 9:00 and left in 1hr. The service was very attentive in the beginning then it died down after we only ordered 3 dishes.",

There is nothing fake about the food when you finally get to your table.   Dishes are served family rustic style which was perfect for our group. The tomahawk steak was done to perfection as were the prawns and tuna poke. Dishes are not huge but it is well priced for the quality you get and their wine list is well considered.",

I love the ambiance of this place! Dark, artsy and classy.   We had reservations and were seated right away. Service was slow at times.... took awhile to order our drinks. Once our server came over, he provided good suggestions and mentioned that we should order 7-8 pieces per person (we had 4 in our group). When it came time to order, we had order 6 dishes and again mentioned that we should order 7-8 per person and that we should to order more. He was pushy and I didn't like that! We appreciate the suggestions but let us order what we want, we can always order more (and we did of our favorite dish).   Our order consisted of.... - Tomato Tartare - sooo good! We ended up ordering a second order.  - Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Dumplings - wayyyy overrated  - Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - standard tuna poke tacos.. good but not the standout dish.  - Thai Style Fried Shrimp - loved the shrimp!  - Elote Style Scallops - served with corn salad, very tasty!  - Garganelli - very good pasta dish!  - Sliders   Overall, the food was fantastic, service was mehhh!",

And the other reviews were right on,  the grilled cheese spoons were to die for.  I also highly recommend the steak toast.

We were planning on ordering more but we were actually very satisfied after those three items.  We ordered two cocktails, which were tasty and VERY strong. While everything is expensive, it is worth it to splurge at this place. The service was fantastic, the food was great, the cocktails were nice, and the atmosphere was high class.

When my friend booked the Cosmopolitan for her birthday in Vegas, and I saw that there was one in the hotel then it was a great opportunity.  I made reservations for Fri night.  I did not have high expectations for this place.  From my previous experiences with restaurants like this one, their food and service is usually subpar. We hadn't eaten all day and when we arrived we were all starving.    Can we also talk about the decor.. So beautiful and tastefully done.  The framed necklaces that hang from the walls.  Such a great idea.     For the 4 of us we must have ordered about 10 or more items from the menu to share.  I mean... come on!!  Everything was so delicious!!! We were very impressed.  We could not stop talking about the food.    Must try: Brussels sprout salad                Beef sliders                Bone marrow                Anything on toast. lol                Steak....like yum!!                 Chorizo Mac n' Cheese (minus the peas for me)  Can wait to try the LA location. Hopefully our experience will be the same.  Sometimes it makes a difference due to the chef.",

It's dimly lit and really loud especially bc they bump hip hop music & maybe because there were a lot of groups last night.  We started off with Caesar Toasts, Roasted Bone Marrow & my fiance ordered a Half Dozen Oysters. The only thing he mentioned was that he wished he'd order all West Coast oysters (I personally don't like oysters so I had no preference). Caesar Toast was good but I wouldn't order it again. It literally tastes like Caesar salad on a a piece of toast. The Roasted Bone Marrow is really good & the server will gladly explain how to eat it if you've never had it before.  The Garganelli was the biggest portion & the most filling. It had bolognese sauce & gorgonzola cheese. One of the most popular dishes, Elote Style Scallops, seems quite simple but is something I'll be craving from now on. It was that good!  This makes a great place for date night & I would come back.",

Hip spot with people soaking in the fabulosity. Ambiance was nice with dimmed lighting and cool decor.  We ordered the short rib mac & cheese and the rib eye. Both were pretty decent but don't think I would order either dish again. The $60 steak they served us was kinda cold & the mac & cheese was not creamy. This restaurant is definitely a good time. Food is not bad. They focus more on presentation and being unique. Go somewhere else if you're looking for GOOD food.",

    "text": "One of my all time favourite restaurants. I've been to the original location in New York which took me months to reserve in advance. I was happy to hear that Beauty & Essex opened a second location in Vegas!   The cocktail menu is impeccable. There's always such a good selection and my personal favourite is either the Bubbly or Beauty Elixir. Both are must tries when you go.   As a tapas place, the portions are quite sizable and great for sharing in groups of 3! However, you can always ask them to prepare a 4th portion on the plate if you're a group of 4. We were a group of 3 so it was perfect and shared 5 dishes (they recommended 6-8 plates).   To start we had the Apple Kale Salad -- my personal fav! There was enough for us to get 2 portions each or 1 full plate each. Then we got the Brussels sprouts (delectable) side with the ravioli, the spaghettini and the mushroom pizza (3 pieces each). All of them were so good and I would highly recommend each of them. Also, the mac and cheese and TO DIE FOR. We didn't get it this time around but I've had it in the past and I would say it's a must-get.   Overall the vibe is super trendy and young. I love the entrance in is through a pawn shop. It's great for parties and bachelorette celebrations. Also the service is on point. :)",

Well beauty and Essex is it, I went here with friends and when I walked in here at first I was like WTF is this, then we got escorted through a secret door and there was this huge restaurant. We had the oysters which was $35 and I didn't think it was worth paying that much for it. For wntree I ordered the lamb chops (medium rare) and boy Oh boy am I glad I ordered that, it was simply amazing I was in such a blissful place while devouring the lamb chops that sat on top of the bed of Yukon gold mashed potatoes.

We were ushered in through a non descript door and taken into the main area where once seated, we were in a loud and lively dining area. The rooms are split up a bit and there is a bar up front as well.   We ordered drinks and then proceeded to try a number of menu items: ceviche, roasted bone marrow, foie gras, dry aged chick sliders, short rib mac n cheese, and elote style scallops. Everything was good (especially the bone marrow and mac n cheese) though I felt the sliders were less juicy than I expected.   After dinner, we headed to Milk and got ice cream to top off a delicious meal! I recommend coming hungry because portions are well sized and I left stuffed.",

Who wants to buy something in a pawn shop prior to going to dinner? INtriguing?  Enticing?  Elegant interior design throughout! Nice bar too but very small.   It was opening so they were very overstaffed. It feels a bit bizarre because there is no room in the kitchen for the staff to stand around. They just camp out by your tables.  Service was impeccable for that reason!  Appetizers were spot on delicious but our pork chops very chewy, fatty, and we had to send them back.  The manager was fabulous though, very apologetic and brought out a tenderloin that was to die for, sliced thin and cooked to perfection.  We will go back.",

Went on a Saturday night at 715, Place was bumping- great energy, full house, very loud (Canada said would have been better is music was louder to drown out the loud voices). I thought the ambiance was great, really enjoyed it. Service was great too. And the food was good...it just seemed a bit disjointed to me, like they have an identity crisis and don't quite know what to specialize in. The menu doesn't seem to fit the space. We ordered octopus tacos: small portion, tortilla was a bit thick for the insides- think this would be better just plated- skip the taco part, overall was mediocre. Empanadas- I enjoyed these, flavors reminded me of a green chili tamale- I skipped the edges of the crust though, was just overkill, but Good bite size portion. Chicken & dumplings- cool presentation, but the sauce left something to be desired- we each skipped the sauce after the first one & just ate the dumpling- which was a bit thick but good. Mexican street corn ravioli- this was a surprise & delight- really enjoyed it and seemed inventive. And the Mediterranean cauliflower. This seemed to miss the mark. No where on the menu does it say 'curry', but it was curried cauliflower- I guess the yogurt was Mediterranean? Who knows. The whole meal was decent, but didn't seem to flow, seemed disjointed in flavor combinations. Atmosphere was good though. Honestly, not sure I'd recommend.",

What a beautiful space: sexy, dark, mysterious, cozy, romantic, & comfortable coupled with the most top notch service I've ever experienced (even compared to Michelin star spots in SF).   My boyfriend and I came in for his birthday on a Wednesday night, he was wished happy birthday right away by the hostess and as we walked to our table, every waiter, busboy, back-server said hello and welcome- even as the restaurant was packed!  Our server, Rozettie, was PHENOMENAL! She was friendly, smiley, knowledgable about everything, attentive and helpful! Our water glasses were never more than half empty, we were never without a cocktail and she coursed the food perfectly. Seriously, I would come back here again for the service alone.  We got to interact with one of the mangers as well and he was fantastic too! Warm, gracious, hilarious, friendly. (I wish I remembered his name!!)  The ambiance and the service give this place 5 stars- as the food itself is really 4 star worthy. Everything is very simple and a little underseasoned. For us, who go out to eat at great places often, we weren't that impressed, especially for the price. But that being said, it was still really good. The bone marrow & the soup dumpling were highlights for sure. I'd say to avoid the pork belly entree- a confused and incohesive dish.  For 2 people: 4 cocktails, 5 dishes came to about $240  TL;DR: GREAT service / GREAT atmosphere / good food",

I was a bit thrown off by the ambiance as the decor was very clean, old-fashioned, dark, and beautifully constructed in contrast to the DJ spinning the best in classic and current R&B/Hip-Hop tracks. Food was amazing and in tapas style so the more you order the fuller you are, and came out very quickly.  Drinks were strong--like put-you-on-your-back-strong--so the prices made sense.

The mains (we ordered the lamb chops, the sirloin, and the pulled pork) were also great. Of course, expect it to be on the pricier side, but it is Las Vegas, and it is the Cosmopolitan hotel.  The drinks were decent - classic martini, bubbles & berries, a mezcal drink, and red wine, but not out of this world.  We had asked our server to please parcel out the dishes if he could, and they ended up coming out all at once. He also asked us about dietary restrictions four times, where it become the running joke of our table. It's nice that he double checked, but asking 4 times made us feel like he was mixing up his tables. We get that they were busy, but we had to ask for silverware/sharing plates, with our food sitting there for awhile.  Love the food and the atmosphere but the staff could use some more support.",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is one Vegas restaurant that's doing absolutely everything right.  It's the full package -- gorgeous ambiance, gracious service, and outstanding food.  Located in the third-floor restaurant zone of the Cosmo, I was impressed by B&E before I even reached the host stand.  As you enter, you pass through a beautiful \"pawn shop\" selling jewelry, guitars, and (perhaps most importantly) copies of Chris Santos' cookbook.  The vibe changes entirely once you enter the restaurant proper, which is covered in stands of pearls and sumptuous decor.  My guest and I opted for seats at the lively bar.  Before long, the bartendress took our dinner orders, and I had a delicious glass of Malbec in hand.  B&E specializes in small plates, which are meant for sharing.  Three plates were just the right amount of food for a dinner for two:  1) Short rib mac and cheese.  Probably the best mac and cheese plates I've ever had.  The cheese was gooey and delicious -- but not heavy.  The short rib was tender and shone through nicely.  The jalapeno cornbread crust provided the perfect crunch.  2) Ratatouille with zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, and piperade.  The perfect accompaniment to the mac and cheese.  The dish was stunning to look at, and the flavor was excellent too, with a nice spicy kick from the piperade.  3) Kygo \"cloud nine\" s'mores with dark chocolate torte, pecan graham crumble, marshmallow clouds, and chocolate sauce.  One of the most fabulous, indulgent desserts I've ever seen.  It's a veritable mountain of delicious chocolate, swimming in marshmallow goodness.  The behemoth portion size was an added bonus.  Throughout our dinner, service was friendly and prompt.  Also friendly were the other patrons at the bar.  Everyone at B&E seems to be there for good food, good times, and minimum pretensions.  That's like my kind of place.  Bravo, Chris Santos -- B&E is exactly what the Vegas dining scene needed.  I can't wait to pay your restaurant another visit.",

Probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Everything from the kale apple salad, empanadas, Ravioli, to onion rings was delicious.

We stopped into the pawn shop, you have to walk through there to get into the restaurant. The woman told us they opened at 5:30. At around 6 I called for a reservation. They said that there wasn't an available table until 9:15. So we just decided to take a chance and walk in on our own time.   We got there at 8:30 and immediately sat down at a table. The wait staff is very friendly and our waitress helped us pick a drink right away. The drinks were great! The food was even better. We shared 3 things. The grilled cheese bites, the onion rings, and the burger with fries. Everything was so tasty. Service and staff were great.   The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I called for a reservation they said they didn't have any open tables until 9:15 and we were able to walk right in at 8:30. And there were many open tables.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located inside the Cosmopolitan. It definitely has a speakeasy theme as it's hidden behind a pawn shop. True to the theme, it's dark and dimly lit inside. The decor is retro, chic and sleek.   Looking at the pawn shop, you would think this place is small, but it's actually pretty large.   The food was good.   The portions were small (tapas style).   It's Vegas so it's not surprising that this place is pretty pricey. $15+ per order and you need at least 3 orders per person if you're there for a meal and not just drinks and a snack.   This is what we had:  ---Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp $21 (My favorite)  ---Roasted Bone Marrow $19 (Very small amount)  ---Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Dumplings $18 (They were unique and delicious)  ---Paprika Spiced Salmon $29 ---Maine Lobster Roll $19  --- Side of Cauliflower $12  Perhaps the fake storefront is too good at concealing this restaurant as it was nearly empty while we were there.    Definitely worth trying at least once.",

Fantastic, down to small details.   The food was excellent. My favorite dish, and one of their most popular, was the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. Taste like comfort food but in an original presentation.   My other favorite dish was the kale and apple salad. All predictable ingredients, but the dressing was perfect.   All the other dishes we ate were great.   My only complaint is that all of our food came out really quickly, leading to a very full table and dishes getting lukewarm. I like it when a restaurant is purposeful in the ordering and timing of dishes, and that was lacking here.   Overall though I recommend trying it out! You won't be disappointed!",

The menu is set up small plate style which is a perfect opportunity to try lots of different things.  We ordered the tuna tacos, empanadas, tomato tartare, tomato soup dumplings, & ricotta chicken meatballs.  The tomato soup dumplings were incredible - everything you think of with comfort food in one perfect bite.  The tomato tartare was like nothing I had ever had before - tangy and tart topped with a smooth quail egg.  The meatballs had flavor I didn't even realize could be created with truffle oil and ricotta.  This was an absolutely incredible meal.",

The only suggestion I would have for the restaurant (I swear I'm not old!!) is that it's extremely dark in there - turning the lights up even the tiniest bit would have been better so you can enjoy the surroundings more.  Looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "This was our first time dining.  We stopped here on a previous visit for drinks.  The menu looks great from a distance and obviously the hidden entrance through the pawn shop will amuse just about everyone (especially on the first visit).  For first time diners, it's small plates.  We personally really like this concept as you get to try a broader selection of dishes.  Prices are higher than you'd probably like but not out of line with similar concepts in Vegas (i.e. the Julian Serrano family of restaurants).  Upon arriving, we found the atmosphere to be far more odd than we recalled it.  No dress code what so ever - think gentlemen in jackets and ladies in nice cocktail dresses mixed with dudes in sandals they bought at Sam's Club for $9.99.  I know dress codes in Vegas are not what they use to be and the concept of dressy casual confuses everyone, but surely management can enforce some type of reasonable minimum.  I would also note that the dining room is very dark - so dark that we saw multiple tables using the flashlights on their phones to read the menu.  There are no windows.  The tables are very close together and the room gets pretty loud.  Our first impression of service was at the bar.  I was quickly turned off when the bartender poured my fiancee's glass of wine out of two different bottles and then precisely (to the drop) measured my $17 Woodford Old Fashioned.  Ms. Bartender, your accountant loves you.  Upon being seated for our reservation, service improved.  While I found our server a little bit casual for my expectations, she was extremely prompt, dishes came out quickly, and the whole service team was quick to clear out dirty dishes and keep water glasses full.  Our server recommended 4-6 dishes for the two of us which in my view will vary based on exactly what you order.  A couple of the dishes we ordered (the Korean Fried Chicken and Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings) were basically just single bites.  If you favor these, you probably want to be on the high side of the recommended servings.  I'd point out that having a starters menu at a small plates concept is confusing to me but I won't digress.    Some quick takes on the dishes we ordered (in the order they were served to us):  Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings - Presentation on the Chinese soup spoons was very cool but  unfortunately so was the temperature - the soup was cold and the dumpling was only lukewarm.  While I found the taste of the dumpling to be a nice contrast to the pungent soup, overall I found the flavors here to be very mild and lacking excitement.  Caesar Toast - While I would probably normally save my calories for something else when eating out, we were browsing Yelp photos and were intrigued by the presentation and volume of photos of this dish.  The concept was great (think bruschetta but with other stuff) and their toast was absolutely perfect (not too crunchy, thick enough to easily support the toppings).  I found the salad to have way too much dressing but overall though this dish was tasty.  Korean Fried Chicken - Think excessively-chewy, cold, boneless sweet and sour chicken bites from Panda Express.  Do not order this.  I'm noticing a trend here - are their dishes meant to be served cold?!  Chorizo \"Carbonara\" Mac & Cheese - Average mac and cheese with chorizo thrown in - it needed a spicier sausage to contract with the smoky flavor of the cheese.  House-Made Cavatelli - this was the best thing we had.  The sausage was spicy and the dish came out piping hot.  Overall, I just couldn't get into Beauty & Essex.  I'm confounded by the 4 star overall review on Yelp.  The flavors just weren't that great and the overall experience (cold food, weird atmosphere) couldn't compensate.  I doubt I'd return on a future visit to Las Vegas.",

The restaurant is located inside The Cosmopolitann Hotel and serves up tapas in cool and original ways!  The restaurant itself plays great music while you are eating, so be prepared and it is done in beautiful browns.....very romantic.  We started with the Grilled Peach and Burrata, went on to chile relleno Empanadas, herb crusted chicken w/watermelon and heirloom tomato salad.  Everything was delicious and featured flavors I would never put together but ended up pure bliss in my mouth!  Fantastic service from seating to our server the night was perfect! I would recommend reservations because the place was packed! Will be on our list next trip out!",

    "text": "Wow.  This Pawn ? Antique store is pretty cool. There's all sorts of interesting items for sale. Well, perhaps, interesting items to behold and wonder if your AMEX card has a sufficient available balance to draw from.  There's a signed pair of sneakers of Notorious B.I.G and a Batman Pez with all sorts of things in between.  But, wait there's more. Actually, let's backup.  Beauty & Essex is cleverly located in the Cosmopolitan. Take the escaltors up past the dizzy aray of strung lights and make a right turn into an area that has a weirdly re-purposed Foosball table.  Yeah, you want to check that out.  In the middle space before entering Beauty & Essex, there's an area that's best described as an adult play area. It is outfitted with champagne buckets, a round table and stools.  It's even gated off like one of those play areas at a mall.  Clearly, we were not special enough to be invited in the ' play area'  Oh well.  So, it is at this point after seeing the Foosball table, the adult play area that we notice the front facing Beauty & Essex.  Again, it's an Antique and Pawn Shop or is it?????????  We entered and started chatting with the attendant and all the while, a couple who looked liked they just arrived from Burning Man walked into Beauty & Essex and went straight the back door and we never saw them again.  I thought, \" Okay.\" then with a puzzled look on my face, I turned to my two companions and said, \" Who were they?\", Josh replied, \" Probably the owners\",   Possible?  Maybe, Highly Unlikely, More like it.  Anyways, we're looking at old matchbooks from the Casinos of yesteryear when two Hipsters, a Vegan, and Warlock walk into Beauty & Essex with a purpose and go straight to the door and disappear.  Now, my interest is peaked and I had to go to the door.    I open the door, and I suddenly realized that it is bigger in the inside than the outside.  It's a freaking Tardis, Doctor Who reference, No actually, Beauty & Essex is actually a speakeasy.  How cool is that?!?!?!  I immediately went back to the Pawn shop and retrieved my brother and my friend and said, \" Guys, Guys.  Come with me.\"   We walked into the waiting area and a troop of hostesses asked if we had reservations, we politely responded by saying no, and asked if we can sit at the bar.    The restaurant and bar were full with patrons. The music was thumping classics like Technotronics and Run DMC.  The ambiance was really cool. Perhaps too cool for me and most likely too cool for us three guys but hey, we're in Vegas, so why not.  Josh decides to order a drink. I apologize that I don't remember what it was called but he said it was really good. I had an Espresso Martini.  We were at the corner end of the bar and it was spectacular scenery.  Watching the barmaids and the bartenders make all sorts of foo foo drinks, Hearing servers interact with the Barfolk, and then the patrons spilling into the bar and the restaurant. This is definitely a people watching spot.  My brother was tempted to order appetizers but we had recently ate so we just finished our drinks and left.     In the end, it was an amazing adventure.  The old Pet Shop Boys song comes to mind,  'You've got the brawn a and I've got the brains, let's make lot's of money.'    Looking forward to going back and running into the two Hipsters, a Vegan, and a Warlock.",

The cocktails were really the-the ODB bramble had a rotten BlackBerry and tasted like fungus.  The shishito peppers were not blistered but somewhat boiled in oil.  The caesar toast was just overdressed salad on bread.  The cavatelli was overcooked, and the BBQ fries were way too seasoned.  It seems that everything is much too bold, and they try to hide it by making the lights as dim as possible until you cannot see the food, and the music so loud you cannot talk to your dining party without telling.  I feel sorry for this spot because when they opened it was good, and I think it may be replaced in a few years at this rate.",

I shared cheese, beacon and tomato soup dumplings, kale & apple salad, Mexican Street corn ravioli, and Thai style shrimp.  The dumplings were good, but they weren't hot.  It is as if they were under a lamp and then served.  I think if it was served hot I would like it a lot betters.  The kale & apple salad was my favorite.  The table next to me had it and it looked so good.  The salad was fresh and very tasty.  I love the crunch of the apples.  The Mexican ravioli was really good; like an elote, but the flavor is on the ravioli.  The Thai style shrimp was on top of a bed of papaya-like salad.  The shrimp were jumbo-sized and pretty tasty.    If you dine here you get complimentary entry to Marquee.  A plus in my book.   Overall, I really loved the food here.  The service is great and I would love to come back.",

    "text": "Wifey took me here to celebrate my birthday and it was the best boomerang dinner! Parking was a breeze if you enter off Las Vegas Blvd, take the elevator, restaurant is right there...which is a HUGE blessing when you're in 6\" inch heels quietly reminding yourself that your toes can handle the pain as long as you look good.  There is a cool pawn shop upon entering and everything is for sale...even some of the people walking in (I'll explain later).  Once you get through pawn shop the actual restaurant-  Atmosphere: Elegant, sexy, dimly lit with a fantastic DJ mixing our favorite jams from when Aquanet clouds were a thing. The vibe is intimate but don't expect to hear anything without yelling or reading lips as it's quite loud early on. It's really like a nightclub with good food.  Food & Drink: Good selection of craft cocktails, wine, and even virgin cocktails with names like \"Garnet Gimlet\" served in coupe gases that let you fit in with the other inbibers.  The menu is mostly tapas style options with a few entrees. Oysters with a frozen mignonette granita--refreshing. Beets & creamy Burata was good, served a top a shmear of beet puree. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - 2 bite crispy deliciousness. Tomato soup dumplings - surprisingly this filled us up. Nice bites of cheesey dumplings with crispy crumbs.  Homemade Cavatelli - Soo good. I was expecting something different when I see cavatelli with broccoli but this dish blew us away. My wife was the lucky one who ordered it. Perfect pasta in a light tomato sauce speckled with spicy Italian sausage and dots of ricotta to mix in. I am so getting this dish the next time.  Mexican Street Corn Ravioli - It's exactly how I would have made it. Elote & ravioli got married here surrounded by their saucy guests.  As I mentioned earlier, everything is for sale especially in Vegas, on the Strip as evidenced by a large group walking in as we were leaving, of buxom ladies in \"uniform\" minis held together with shoelaces accompanied by unremarkable, blue pill poppin, grey haired old men paying the night forward who will probably bring home a contagious souvenir. Hope the Beauty & MEH-Sex was worth it.",

We had our 11 and 14 yr. old kids with us, we knew the restaurant wasn't for kids but the service towards us wasn't pleasant from the hostess to the waiter. They may as well put a sign up that says no children allowed if they're going to treat families differently. And no the kids weren't behaving badly, the table next to us even complimented us on their behavior. The setting is dark and seating comfortable.

    "text": "Overall it was a generally mediocre experience and definitely not worth a return visit.  We decided to try B&E out since numerous things on the menu looked interesting (if a bit disjointed with mexican, spanish, italian, and asian dishes interspersed).  Server explained about small plates, how much would be appropriate, etc, and we ended up ordering 7 things.  The pacing of the food was terrible.  Some dishes arrived within minutes of ordering (10 minutes faster than our wine), and all 7 arrived within a short period of time resulting in too much on the table at once and things going cold.  Small plates coming out randomly is not a new concept, but most kitchen pace things over a period of time to avoid the problems we ran into.  The various dining rooms are packed pretty tightly with tables, to the point where staff had difficulty moving between tables.  This may contribute to the noise level which many people comment on which is louder than expected.  Here's what we ended up getting: Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - Decent flavor, but nothing that you haven't had at a dozen other places that serve this with the poke craze going on.  Yellowtail Sashimi - Probably the best dish of the evening.  Again something everyone has on the menu these days, but this had it's own standpoint with the flavored ponzu and the texture/flavor of the toppings on the fish.  Caesar toast - It's ceasar salad on toast topped with crumbled crispy chicken skin.  There's not enough chicken skin to provide a change in texture or flavor.  Roasted bone marrow - 3 half bones, well roasted, with salt and marmalade on the side if you want it.  The salt was key, but again the was nothing special about this if you've had roasted marrow before.  Tomato soup dumplings - Cheese tortellini sitting in tomato soup, very underwhelming.  Neither component had any particularly interesting flavor.  I thought for sure this was going to be some sort of xiao long bao presentation, which would have at least been a novel form.  Spanish braised octopus tacos - Good cook on the octopus, which is appreciated.  It's an interesting way to attempt and meld the traditional spanish octopus into a taco, but the beans didn't really add anything and the saffron made things taste \"fishy\" which took away from the octopus.  Croque Monsieur Mac & Cheese - Pretty boring mac and cheese.  I didn't understand what made it \"croque monsieur\" and definitely didn't taste the dijon.  The noodle to sauce ratio was also off resulting in too much noodle not having a good cheese sauce coating.  This was the last to arrive on an already full table and was lukewarm by the time we got to it. I do give kudos to the server who replaced it with a fresh one after we commented on that fact.",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is the sexiest restaurant in Vegas. Located inside the gorgeous Cosmopolitan hotel, it's hidden behind what appears to be a quiet jewelry shop. We gave the woman behind the counter our reservation name, and she led us to a side door which almost made us feel as if we were being taken back into a speakeasy.   Once inside, the atmosphere instantly changed and was a whirlwind of nightlife and energy. Lots of dark accents and soft lighting, beautiful people, stunning plates of food, and lounge music playing in the background. I loved that they had matches in a bowl by the hostess stand too, as it reminded me of all the ones I collected from fancy restaurants over the years when I was younger during special family occasion dinners.   It was easy to make a reservation through OpenTable, and the corner booth we were given was ideal for people watching during our meal. None of us were particularity starved, so our game plan was to order a bunch of smaller plates and share them tapas style. That way we could also each try a little bit of everything.   My friend and I each got a glass of wine while my husband ordered a beer, and we decided to first start with their dumplings since those were what I had heard so much about. The french onion soup ones came out first, and were presented in what appeared to be an escargot dish.  The dumplings were filled with an onion soup broth, and were at the bottom of a toothpick. When you lifted it up, a string of melty cheese would follow and you simply pop the whole thing in your mouth and pull the toothpick out. A crouton is at the end of each bite which gave a nice added texture. They were insane! Putting french onion soup into dumpling form was a downright genius idea.   I didn't think it was possible that I would love anything else that night as much as those, until the next dumplings came out which were grilled cheese and smoked bacon dumplings that sat on a spoonful of rich tomato soup. STOP IT. Actually don't, because I would like to eat about 89,000 more of those in my lifetime please.   We also ordered sweet and crispy Vidalia onion rings that came with a deliciously kicked up sambal ketchup, street style BBQ thai chicken with fresh picked carrots, mango, and a flavorful parsnip puree, and I believe french fries may have come into the equation at some point too, don't judge.   Each plate exceeded our expectations and kept our taste buds singing. I can't wait to make a return visit to try some of the dishes I didn't get to the first time around. In particular the bone marrow toast, chicken arepas, the short rib mac and cheese, elote scallops, strawberry shortcake bars, peanut butter pie sundae, and birthday cake shots.",

One thing I have to say...$50 corkage fee was really extreme and ridiculous.  They should really bring that fee WAY down because it made them look petty. Other than that, it was a fun and checked that off our list of restaurants to try. On to other restaurants that don't charge such an exorbitant corkage fee.",

This place was crowded, but the service was pretty quick. The food was spectacular.   For our apps: -Tomato Soup Dumplings (a special of the night) -Onion Rings - Jewels on Toast- Ceasar with Crispy Chicken Skin  They were both fantastic. The dumplings were absolutely incredible.  For our dinner:  -My mom got the filet- medium rare- cooked perfectly -I got the lamb chops- also cooked perfectly and the best chops I've ever had.   We shared a side of the Mac and Cheese. I'm not a huge fan of bacon or 'smokey' flavors, so it wasn't my favorite, but my mom loved it.   All-in-all the vibe was 100% what we were looking for. It was unique and quirky how when you walk in, it looks like a jewelry shop. We had a great experience and would be back next time we are in Vegas.   Expect to pay about $150-$200 for two people (before tip) if you're drinking.-",

Being that it was Sunday many of the places I planned on were closed, but luckily beauty & Essex stays open til 12! Perfect.   Walked in without reservations. Looking super bummy compared to the other diners lol, it's a place you definitely want to dress up a bit.   Food:  Oysters - 4 stars. very good. Fresh tasting. I liked the flavor of the mignonette here, however the bf and I both thought it would be better if it wasn't frozen.   Bone marrow - 3 stars. I felt this could have been roasted more it wasn't that melt in your mouth texture I look for. I enjoyed the cilantro salad it came with as it added a much needed freshness between the rich marrow and hearty bread. Carmelized onions were also a nice addition I could have eaten those by themselves.   Sliders - 5 stars. Cooked to perfection, topping with pickled onion and tomato jam. the simple toppings were done so well they really didn't need anything more.   The service here was absolutely great even though we didn't fit the dress code haha.  We both really enjoyed this as our last meal in Vegas.",

From the service, the ambiance, and the food- everything was spectacular. The only difference is that the music was still really loud in the dining area so it was hard to have conversation without yelling across the table.   We ordered the tomato soup dumplings, the ahi tacos, the scallops, the steak, salmon, Mexican corn ravioli, their curry carrots, their bao mini sandwiches, and the meatballs...so technically the whole menu haha Jk. Everything was cooked and seasoned to perfection and with a party of 7, we were all stuffed considering the tapas style servings. Everything was divine but I did have my favorite dishes of the night...you can never go wrong with the tomato soup dumplings! It's like heaven in your mouth! The scallops were perfect and had a little spice to it! I love spicy but I didn't find it spicy at all versus my friend who has a more sensitive palate found it too much. Lastly, the salmon...I've never had salmon cooked the way they had it. It was moist and perfect and the couscous with the spinach complimented it perfectly. I honestly cannot wait to go back and eat there again!",

Half the restaurant was still empty and we requested to be seated at a larger table, but they never moved us.   We ordered the K-town Bao buns, Grilled cheese dumplings, scallops, ravioli, Thai shrimp and chicken meatballs. The grilled cheese dumplings came out kinda cold, the Bao buns were a little strange because it was like hamburger meat with Asian slaw, it threw me off since it was like a fusion between and American burger, but would be better off with pork belly inside. The ravioli was a little too rich for us. The sauce the put on the ravioli was pretty rock and the Mexican corn elote was too dry. The scallops were super salty and over cooked, that we had to return it. The chicken meatballs were too mushy for us. The only thing we really enjoyed were the Thai shrimp, which had a great batter and was deep fried. I enjoyed the papaya salad that came with it as well.   I really wanted to try some of their other dishes that I saw on yelp, but they change their menu seasonally which is a shame. I also wish they had their butter popcorn ice cream that I loved at their Los Angeles location.   Having been to the Beauty and Essex in New York and Los Angeles. I had high hopes for this Vegas location.   Overall, it's a cool spot to check out, but there are a lot of better restaurants to eat at the Cosmo.",

My husband happens to mention that we like scotch and whiskey and so Casey basically hooked us up with the most amazing selection of mixed drinks and tastings.  We ordered oysters and the avocado toast and some other apps as well and everything was incredible. At the end when Casey found out it was his birthday he hooked us up with birthday drink shots and dessert that was like fresh donut holes to be dipped in different sauces. One of the best experiences of our life for sure, not just for the amazing food and drinks, but because we were able to talk to an awesome guy who loves what he does and his passion and love for his job were clear as day!!  Will def stop by again and look forward to running into Casey; the best bartender we encountered in Vegas!!!",

Apparently, the idea is that the restaurant is hidden behind a pawnshop, speakeasy-style. Drinks were fine. We had bottled water but the bottles looked homemade/ reusable, like maybe they had been filled in the back from a big jug or something; they didn't look commercial.  The food could have been amazing but the meat was not hot- tepid turkey breast with gravy. We ordered the Yukon potato puree; the waitress brought the sweet potato puree. They did make that right with no charge. We ordered the glazed baby carrots but the vegetable they brought out didn't seem like carrots; it was some kind of an oily root vegetable we'd never had before, parsnips? The pumpkin ravioli was good but not great. All the food seemed to have a slight soggy consistency and wasn't hot. Both of us had tummy troubles afterwards; I don't know if that was a coincidence or related. The staff was courteous but distracted and we probably won't be back. Two meals with one drink each and 20 percent gratuity was $135.",

Day of the reservation, I received a call with confirmation and once again I stated we are celebrating 2 birthdays. I wasn't expecting for them to sing happy birthday or give us a comp'd dessert but I was hoping for good service.  The reservation was at 6:30 and didn't walk out of the restaurant until 8:30. We ordered 5 different plates which included the seared rare tuna. It took the kitchen 45 minutes to finally give us the seared rare tuna. It should never take that long. My party and I looked around and saw other tables that sat after us get all of their food at once while we were waiting every 15-20 minutes for one dish. We asked our server why our meals were taking so slow and she stated \"we like our guests to enjoy each bite before bringing the next meal.\"  The manager was walking around greeting tables and I was hoping he would have stopped at our table but he did not. Not only will I not come back, but being a Concierge on the strip, I will not be recommending this restaurant to my guests!",

Hoping for the same here at our favorite Vegas resort. Fun entrance with the whole pawn shop look and beat up grey door to push your way through. We were seated at our reservation time at a 2 top facing each other. Not our favorite seating arrangement, we like sitting to each other for the intimacy and easy conversation.  The restaurant has low ceiling's and it is loud. Conversation across the table was almost impossible. one star  Service was the second star missing, very slow and spotty. Our waitress was slow taking our drink order. Then when we ordered our food, Lobster roll, excellent. Thai Shrimp next..... well almost next... When our entree came out, an excellent fillet, we asked about the shrimp, she rushed over to the computer and we soon had our long over due app. A to go order for some excellent dounts with chocolate and berry dipping sauce. So great food, service needed work and very loud... and I normally like loud.",

It was featured on the Cosmopolitan channel in our room and my husband decided he needed the meatballs. We were a bit confused as we walked in because your in a \"pawn shop\" but another door leads you into the restaurant. You almost feel like you're in a super secret club. I knew nothing of the restaurant but our server was very sweet and helpful. The food is meant to share, tapas style. I will be dreaming of the soup and grilled cheese dumplings until my next Vegas trip. These are a must! Another winner is the Mexican corn ravioli. My only complaint is I wanted more of everything but honestly I had no room. We left full after sharing 6 dishes between 3 people.

All of the people in our party did not arrive yet and she told us we could not be sat until our whole party arrived, which I understand. However, she was very rude and did NOT look happy to be at work. Once our whole party arrived she told us we still had to wait to be sat? My friends and I waited 45 minutes only not to be sat. We were fed up with her attitude and the way she was talking to us so we decided to sit in the lounge since a full menu was offered. The cocktail servers took EXCELLENT care of us! They were all so nice and made great recommendations. I tried new food that I did not try on my last visit! We were happy that we were taken care of in the lounge. It was a great atmosphere too!

We were 12 girls celebrating a birthday - we ordered tapas style and tried a little bit of almost everything on the menu and it was all delicious - even got a nod of approval from our very picky eaters.  Very cool vibe, DJ was great, and the girls are still talking about the mojitos!  I highly recommend!",

The yellowtail is the best I've ever had, the same for the oysters. You cannot ever not have the French Onion soup dumplings. Not kidding. Lamb chops phenomenal, and the lobster and sweet potato thing, doesn't sound like it would work, it does. Great cocktails, great wines. Desserts are superb. Can't wait to go back.",

The pawn shop entrance is cool, and the restaurant itself is beautiful although very dimly lit. We waited in the lounge for our table and were promptly asked for drink orders which was nice. Once our table was ready we were led through a (dark) maze of tables. A word of caution, if you are looking for somewhere to have a conversation, go somewhere else! Also, if you like to have space around you, go somewhere else! If you don't mind rubbing elbows and yelling at the top of your lungs, then by all means proceed. The music selection was fun, it is definitely somewhere to go before hitting the club. The food was AMAZING! We ordered a variety of small plates, the server was very helpful when it came to describing portion sizes. There were six of us so she made sure each order had six pieces so we could all taste them. So-So dishes: pulled chicken arepas, chile relleno empanadas, short rib mac & cheese, onion rings, butterscotch pot de creme Delicious dishes: Tomato soup dumplings, tuna tacos, basil ravioli AMAZING: thai style shrimp & doughnuts (the server said the devils food layer cake was also good)",

    "text": "Truly Meh...maybe it was the night or the weather or the crowd but this was a mixed bag. Got to the restaurant 15 mins early to make sure all was good with the reservation, the hostess was friendly and got us to a table a few mins early. First thing I noticed was an odd light smell of BO, kind of weird but it was one of those things that just seems weird. The place was pretty crowded and really loud. Waited a bit for someone to notice we were there, might have been because we weren't with any scantily clad ladies. Anyway, once the waitress arrived she became the True star of the experience, very nice, overly attentive and agreed that the place was just way to loud. So really a hit in stars for ambiance, the food came out quickly it was good but also hit or miss. Steak tartare, awesome and wonderfully presented; french onion soup dumplings were a congealed cheesy mess; oyster platter so-so half good half tiny and lame. On to the mains, Thai chicken was very good juicy well flavored but too heavy on the ginger, Lamb chops presented beautifully and they were cooked perfectly but to my dismay they were cold! Since the place was a mad house figured it wasn't worth complaining. So there were highlights and low points, all in all wanted this place to live up to the hype. Maybe next time...",

You walk beyond the door and immediately are greeted and sat in the dining room, so beautiful!! My husband and I started off with the beauty elixir and their version of an old fashioned and both were great. We then preceded to order everything, eggplant pizzette, French onion dumplings, chicken ceaser toast, grilled cheese and tomato soup, double rack of lamb and broccolini. I don't even know where to begin it was all heavenly!!! I am a big foodie and my husband not so much but for once he couldn't stop talking about the food I was shocked.  We then finished up with the birthday cake shots OMG we could of ordered 6 or more they were soooooo good. I can promise you this is one of the best places on the strip, I should know I eat everywhere. We can't wait to go back and try more things no matter what I'm sure you will never be disappointed. So thank you Chris Santos and staff for making all this happen you have a client for life!!!",

    "text": "Meh.... Not worth the money. There are better restaurants in Vegas to try out. Was looking forward to trying Beauty and Essex since the one in New York City is wonderful. The concept of the restaurant is really great. You walk into what feels like a pawn shop with no signs that the door you're walking into will walk you into a beautiful restaurant. I enjoyed the decor and environment but unfortunately the food and drinks just left little be to excited about. We ordered a few plates that were recommended by our waitress and a few others that we picked out on our own. The cocktail I ordered (the mango mojito) tasted as if they poured half a bottle of lime juice in it. I wasn't even able to put it down. Their take on lobster rolls was disgusting. It tasted like cat food.   Our meatballs were the only thing I was able to eat without leaving me with an awful taste in my mouth. I like to consider my self a 'foodie' and I enjoy expensive flavorful food with a creative twist but I wasn't impressed. Overall, I think may we dined on a off night or maybe ordered incorrectly.  If you're looking to try a tapas restaurant in Vegas I highly recommend Cleo in the SLS it's fantastic!!",

We were in the back room and the acoustics were pretty terrible for being able to hear each other as it was very loud.   The tapas themselves were decent but nothing special. I tried the cheese empanada, avocado toast, raw salmon cup, kale salad, and thai shrimp. Out of everything, the Kale salad with walnuts was probably the best thing we had.   On a non-food note, there are no bathrooms in the restaurant. You have to walk out of the restaurant and down the hall to be able to get to a bathroom. Why would you want to encourage people to leave your restaurant? Seems like a strange decision to me.",

The restaurant was packed and super loud but the service stayed on point. It was fun and all but lets not forget about the best part, the FOOD. It was absolutely delicious!

It all came out under 4 minutes. That sounds good but with some food it needs to be made to order. It feels like #mcdonalds but 30x the price. Even the #onionrings were not fully fried to order. You could tell by the temp. Luke warm when they hit our table. It's a clever trick by many a smart chef and operations manager to have things prepared to go straight to a table. No long ticket times and you can turn tables much faster. But when you get to higher end #restos show me a little love cooking the food. #grilledcheese #dumplings and #tomatosoup genius. Truly #delicious and superb presentation. That needs to be pre cooked and ready to serve. But the #boa #burger please cook a slider patty to order. Fuckery of the restaurant biz at its finest. But I'll be back to try more. Flavor don't lie. #foodie #foodporn #Vegas #thestrip",

I had heard mixed things about B & E, but generally speaking that there was some good food and vibes to be had.  so I had to make it a point to get reservations while in Sin City. Arrived slightly late at the entrance and noticed the facade which had a pretty neat vibe and the staff were friendly in ushering us in. The front seems to be kind of like an older antiquities kind of store feel to give the speakeasy kind of vibe ( but in a different light)...Anyhow, I digress, we met our group and were placed at our table. Space was nice and table was dimly lit. Overall really nice vibe although a bit loud to have good conversations with some of the people across from you. Service was solid and waiter was more than helpful in laying out the variety of tapas they have on deck. Had many different types of food but came away loving the grilled cheese ( which had a burst of flavor in such a small bite), the tuna poke wonton tacos which were stunning ( we eventually ordered 2 more)  of, and the salmon ceviche which was delectable! We also ordered the burrata bruschetta which was brilliant...drinks were on point and overall a meal not to be missed! Would most definitely recommend if you are in any of the cities (LA , NY , LV) they are in. Only thought the prices are a bit steep, but if you want an excellent meal at a really trendy and cool establishment this is your place ! Enjoy !!",

The food is good, but the ambience swayed towards loud music and dim lights -- not somewhere you can have a decent conversation at. The food is served tapa style, so order 4-5 items for every 2 people. The plates came out 1-2 at a time and everything tasted great, but most of our dishes were at room temp. I didn't enjoy my tomato soup dumplings since it came out cold, but the thai shrimp came out hot -- I ended up ordering that twice, it was so good!  We also ordered the Korean Bao and scallops. Both were good, but again, didn't come out hot. I like cold sandwiches though...it prevents the vegetables from wilting so I would have ordered the bao again if I weren't so full.",

The best part was when our server brought out cake pops to wish me a happy birthday! It was totally unexpected considering my husband only told the hostess it was my birthday. Thank you Beauty and Essex for turning what started out as a sad birthday dinner into a fabulous one!! This is our 3rd visit here and we will definitely be back! Each meal has been worth every penny!",

We kept wondering if it was possible for the food to get better and it did. Not to be overlooked is the atmosphere here which is a crowded restaurant that somehow gives an intimate touch when you're at your table. I look forward to going back.",

It starts with the location, upstairs in the Cosmopolitan's odd, mall-like Main Street of restaurants, a corporatization of food seemingly set up for conventions and business folks rather than anything special or romantic. The pawn shop (?) entrance was nice and the rooms interesting, but again, it felt like a Disney version of a genuinely charming restaurant that exists somewhere else. In an almost empty room they tried to seat us next to some kind of cashier or bussing station where a bunch of waiters were hanging out--no thanks, we'll take a booth, please. Quickly that same bad table was taken by another couple--shouldn't you give it away last, once the room is full? In short: Waiter: great, very professional and pleasant. Food: nice oysters and the frozen mignonette sauce is a pleasant surprise. The tomato soup/dumplings were disappointing--strong tomato flavor mixed with a weird, sometimes chewy, sometimes doughy, sometimes crispy bag of something. Truly not great, and meanwhile the broccolini swam in an odd fish-type sauce. They're trying very hard to make B&E feel special, but it just isn't.",

I agree it's loud (and dark) but it didn't bother me much.   It took a while to be seated and get our food. I expected this a bit because it is Vegas after all and this is a \"cool\" place but it took a bit longer than what I'd consider to be normal \"hollywood buffer\" standards (wow I sound kind of douchey) We had an additional minor issue w/ the food served but long story long... I was happy w/ management's response when we brought it to their attention. They had a great attitude about trying to make it right vs. arguing with us. Yes, that sounds crazy vague and bizarre but i wanted to give them points for it without going into the gritty details of our situation.  Overall there's a lot to love about this place from ambiance, to drinks, to flavors of the food (all exceptional). the slowness of the kitchen, etc was very much overshadowed by the really good customer service we received. so Yay i'm a fan. and yes i'd be back.",

(1/2 doz $18) Another fav is the Caesar Toast  Creamy garlic, crispy chicken skin ($12 3pieces). Short Rib 'Mac & Cheese' was just ok. Pressed Jerk-Spiced Chicken was full of flavor and the chicken was juicy and tender ($27) Dessert was hands down the best! \"Strawberry Shortcake\" Bars: Liquid cheesecake, white chocolate, cap'n crunch ($11) and Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme ($13)",

Similarly, to the Las Vegas location, I've referred many, many people who ask for my opinion.   It's always been wonderful. Last night, was perfect again, but only perfect until the last 5 minutes of the meal. Then it got disappointing. Haimer (our waiter) was not of the customer service level I expect when coming here. We ordered a drink, never received it, were charged for it, and then when I asked about it, was given a rude response. Finally, as the bill is being signed, the drink comes. I ask for it to be taken off, and was given another rude response as if I'M being out of line.   Wonderful food, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth at a restaurant I've been coming to for years. May go across the way to Jaleo next time choosing where to eat....",

Not a great place for romantic encounters. More for party groups.  The menu is all over the place. You have Italian, Asian, Seafood, Steak, the works. This lack of focus shows in the food, unfortunately.  We ordered the following:  Grilled cheese, bacon and tomato soup dumpling - WTF was this? Not a good mix of flavors at all. We only ordered it because the server went on and on about it.  Short rib mac and cheese - This actually would've been pretty good if I could've found more than 2 pieces of short rib in it.  Spaghettini - What a disaster. The pasta was way overcooked and just drowned in flavorless pesto. We literally took one bite each and left the rest.  Filet mignon - Ordered it medium rare, got it medium to medium well. Since this was the last entree we ordered, we were so over the experience already so decided not to send it back.  Cloud Nine Smores - So so overly sweet. And there was some inexplicable blue streak on the plate as if a smurf had left skid marks on it. So strange. This is the one dish the waiter actually asked how it was and when I told him it was too sweet, they were kind enough to take it off our bill.  Overall, a very disappointing experience and I will never be back.",

    "text": "The wife and I continued to \"unlock our Monday\" at Beauty & Essex for dinner.  We had reservations for 9PM.  The place was jammed, literally and figuratively, when we got there.  Although I haven't been to the NYC original, Beauty & Essex's dining room, unsurprisingly, reminded me of a lot of some NYC restaurants where space is at a premium and tables and diners are squeezed into close quarters.  The noise level of the dining room was tinnitus inducing with thumping club music and a full house of diners practically screaming at each other trying to be heard over the unnecessarily loud music in a room with hard floors and walls unadorned with anything that could be considered sound dampening.  They only sound absorbing materials in the house were basically the diners and service staff.  I'm not too old that I can't or don't appreciate loud music and energetic crowds, but Beauty & Essex seemed to amp it up to an almost intolerable volume.  Not surprisingly, the combination of close quarters and cacophony resulted in service slips.  I noticed multiple cases where food runners delivered dishes to incorrect tables.  In fact, one of our dishes was delivered to a party two tables down from us.  We were more in need of food than more drinks, so we passed on selections from Beauty & Essex's appealing list of cocktails.  For our food, we shared orders of the Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche ($15), Roasted Bone Marrow ($19), and Garganelli ($22).  The Roasted Bone Marrow was a nicely sized portion of two big marrow-filled bones, which came with grilled bread and a rioja braised shallot marmalade as an accompaniment.  It was simple in its presentation, perfectly executed, and delicious.  On the other hand, the other two dishes were failures in presentation and/or execution.  The ceviche tasted all right with bright mango notes complementing the fresh salmon, but it was lacking in execution and presentation.  The knife work on the salmon appeared sloppy.  If you eat first with your eyes, then it was difficult to differentiate between what was salmon and what was mango in the dimly lit room based on sight.  Exacerbating the issues with the dish was that the salmon was drowned in its \"cooking\" liquid and spooned into what amounted to be three Tostito Scoops, which became soggy, losing any hint of crispness.  Perhaps this dish needed to be eaten immediately upon being served.  However, this was the item that had been delivered to the wrong table.  The Garganelli, topped with a sweet & spicy lamb Bolognese and whipped ricotta, while edible, was not enjoyable.  The pasta was overcooked and didn't taste much, if any, better than overcooked, store bought, dried pasta.  The Bolognese was all sweet and little spice, unless you equate saltiness to spiciness, so much so we had to ask our server what was the sweet component in the dish.  It was a balsamic glaze.  Nevertheless, the sauce had a cloyingly sweet component that overpowered everything else save for salt.  It wasn't good.  We left our Garganelli unfinished after only our initial of bites.  We probably should've sent it back, but didn't because we'd had enough.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things.  Maybe we caught them on an off night.  The staff all seemed personable, attentive, and eager to please.   Other diners seemed to be enjoying themselves.  For whatever reason, Beauty & Essex was a swing and a miss and the biggest dining disappointment of our trip.  That said, I'd definitely be willing to give it another try, if only for their cocktails.",

I LOVED the Emerald Gimlet drink, so fresh and basil-y.  My friend really enjoyed The Woodsman.  The place was packed, and if there was a criticism of this restaurant, it was that it was VERY LOUD. We really had to yell to communicate with one another at the table.   I would totally recommend this restaurant experience.",

The place is a little loud so in a group setting it might be hard to hear someone if they are sitting far from you.  So as I was sitting at dinner thinking maybe this wouldn't be a very good date spot because it's not very romantic ... Then 5 minutes later a guy proposes to his girlfriend at the table next to us.  OK so maybe I'm wrong?  It could be romantic just depends on the person.  :)  Our waitress was super attentive as was the rest of the staff, the food came out really fast which was nice since we had a show to catch.  All the dishes we shared were yummy with the exception of the chicken arepas ... I'd skip that one.  But everything else we ordered was DELISH!!    I'm excited to check out the LA location once it opens up!  :)",

The atmosphere is fun and different, tucked away behind a pawn shop. The restaurant is very loud, practically have to yell to have a conversation. The other issue is our table was sandwiched between two other tables with maybe 2 feet between. So not only did you get to hear the parties next to you life story, it was hard to carry your own conversation. There was very little personal space. The food was average, nothing special.",

Nestled on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, this place didnt disappoint! Tapas style food is great for a group to share food. The sliders were awesome, lobster roll crostinis were tasty, all the salads were fantastic and refreshing. Short rib mac n cheese was rich and flavorful and the drinks were satisfying. The NYC location has a more \"clubby/popping\" scene which wasnt True in the Vegas location but it was still fun. And if you eat there you get a stamp to get free admission into Marquee-the club in the Cosmo which was fun!",

It's great to share and pretty substantial without being too heavy.  2. French onion soup dumplings. It's not as soup as you'd imagine, and the cheese on top can harden quickly, but don't worry once you have one the rest go quite quickly.  We also got the kale salad and the meatballs which were also delciious. But I'd say the ones listed above won it for me.",

Everyone we went with has worked in the restaurant industry before so we have a pretty good idea of how things work and this was awful. Their motto is \"we always make sure there's enough for the table\"... AKA, we will charge you for extra bites of food even though you didn't order it. Never mind the fact that my bites of food never came and our server couldn't have cared less. When we complained to the manager about the service and bill he offered to give us a reservation at the LA location. Oh yah! We get to drive 100 miles away from our house to go through this horrific experience again? No thanks. He ended up comping the drinks that actually made it to the table (two never came) and our bill was still close to $200. We all left and went to the hidden pizza place across the hall. I would suggest avoiding this place at all costs and just throwing your money away on a slot machine.",

Great music - There was a Asian Female DJ who was on Fleek with the 90's and early 2K hip hop joints. Since that what me and the company I was with, enjoyed, we knew it was going to be a good night.  The food - had the Sashimi Yellowtail with Jalapeno - excellent grade and thinly cut. Definitely something that you crave a night or 2 after. Had the lobster Roll which was good too! The roll is what made it too... It was like a grilled King's Hawaiian type flavor bread. The lobster was made to perfection and its mayo mix was on point! The grilled cheese, wrapped in bacon and tomato soup was a great presentation and good. Had the house salad which was pretty amazing. The bone marrow was probably one of our favorites! We were celebrating a promotion so we indulged on the cowboy ribeye steak. As you could probably tell from my previous reviews, I am a big steak guy. Though cooked to perfection, it didn't hold up to Golden Steer's Ribeye. I wanted it to, trust me! I wanted it to be the best steak I've had and taste as pretty as it looked but it was only partially there. Was it better than most... Yes. But not the best that I have had.  We had the donuts for dessert, as well and they were great!   All in all Beauty and Essex was awesome and we had a great time and the food is great here. It is in a premier location and do look forward to coming back. I know the set back was the 125 dollar steak but that is ok. I know that they will improve cause they know how competitive the strip and well just Vegas in general is! Good owners who will definitely step it up!",

We ordered the Beauty Eliquer, which was ok but more fruity than I typically care for and the Gimlet martini, which I highly recommend if you like basil and a refreshing cocktail ($17 each). The plates are small and mostly come in 3's, which aren't great when sharing between two people on some of the items- like the ahi tuna tacos.. But they are AMAZING! Also ordered and fell in love with the kale and apple salad, the chicken meatballs and avocado toast. My friends fav was the tacos, but mine was the avocado toast- it was surprisingly amazing!!! Lastly we ordered the birthday cake shot- it was just ok and likely wouldn't order it again- Makers Mark forward and comes in a milkshake form with a straw and sprinkled rim. The atmosphere is dimly lit and it was packed the time we were there! We left spending about $200 and without being full- it was the perfect amount of food!!",

The food was outstanding and I would have given this 5 stars HOWEVER, our waiter didn't seem to think a party of two was important enough to check on us or fill our water glasses.  He and his trainee were too busy tending to the larger party who were going to spend A LOT of money.  That part was a bummer.  The short ribs mac 'n cheese is to die for!!!",

Given the quality of the cuisine and attention from the staff that won't keep us from coming back.  The scallops here are the best I can recall ever having. They were properly seared, seasoned, and melted in my mouth.  They were served on an amazing corn relish as well.  The portion of fries is pricey - even for here ....they're fries.  Great ambiance.",

    "text": "My friend and I went for dinner, we had a reservation for 10 P.M.  We did get there about 5 minutes early so we were given a pager and said we could wait in bar area. A waitress came and asked us if we would like a cocktail, we said yes but we wanted to look at the drink menu. She said ok and walked away. We waited a while and she did not come back so we asked someone passing by if we could get a drink. They told us they would get some one. The same waitress comes back and starts by saying \"I'm guessing you changed your mind?\" We ignored her comment and ordered our drink. The drinks came out right away I ordered one of their mixed drinks and my friend ordered wine. My drink was awful and my friend did not like hers either. By this time it was 10:15 and we had not been paged yet so I went to check and I was told we were next. We waited 10 more minutes and we finally got pages at 10:25. As we walked to the front to be taken to our table water drips on my friend. The person at the front sees this and says there is a leak and that they know about it, like it was no big deal. We get sat at our table and start to look at our menu. The table was dirty and still had the check from the previous customer. We ordered some kind of brisket tacos as an appetizer. As I unfolded my napkin I noticed it was very damp. I asked my friend if hers was dry and she said no. We asked for replacement napkins and they gave them to us right away. The tacos came they were underwhelming. We then ordered the bone marrow, pork chops, lamb chops, broccoli, and two more cocktails. I ordered a rose it was ok, she had champagne and it was very flat. The only think we really enjoyed and seemed to have any effort put into was the lamb and the bone marrow. The bill came and it was 200 dollars. For the amount of money they charge you would expect a better experience not the mediocre one we had. Very disappointed over all. Next trip to Vegas I will not be visiting here again.",

Our server, ANNA, was FABULOUS...yes....FABULOUS...if you want an attentive, informative, and just overall kind human being to serve you, ask to sit in her section...you won't be disappointed! She guided us through the menu and we trusted all of her suggestions!!! Thai Shrimp was crunchy yet light...the tomato soup and grilled cheese dumplings were so divine we ordered 2 (don't judge me)...ahi wonton tacos were incredibly delicious I could've made a dinner out of those...my husband loved the bone marrow and shallot marmalade so much he texted pictures to all his foodie friends...they were instantly jealous...we left there happier than we could've ever imagined...Anna made our night so fantastically special...we can't wait to come back and do it all over again...thank you B&E, Anna, and all the wonderful staff...",

Our waiter, unfortunately I can't remember his name, but was bald with a chin strap beard, was atrocious. We had to practically stand on the table for drink refills. One of the Members of my dining partner was not served his meal at all. Instead of the 14oz sirloin he was given a plate of chicken meatballs.  The check arrives and to my astonishment not only did he charge us for the missed meal, but for a second plate of chicken meatballs. I'm assuming they have quite a few drunk patrons who don't notice the mistakes on their meals. It's a shame the service destroyed our meals because those of us who actually had the correct meals enjoyed what we were served.",

We had already tried the other restaurants on this floor and were really looking for something new. I was not crazy about the pawn shop look so I was a bit hesitant to go in but do not be fooled by it. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely stunning!!!!! We ordered a dozen of their oysters, East Coast and West Coast, and loved them. We also got the ahi tuna tacos which were amazing! We tried the salmon ceviche but I would skip on those. I would recommend ordering 2 of the tacos instead because each order is 3 small pieces. The lamb was amazing and the portion was surprisingly big considering the other items that we ordered. We also go the lobster mac and cheese..or was it something else.. Not sure but it was a Mac N Cheese item and it was delicious. My husband ordered a Long Island and it was strong. The wait staff was also on top of everything! Very knowledgeable and kept refilling our drinks! All in all, 5 stars in my book.",

There are few selections on this menu that are not in the NY menu that I was happy to try. One of my new favorites are the French Onion Soup Dumplings! Soooooo good! They also have Short Rib Mac And Cheese that could have had a bit more short rib but still delicious. The Jerk Chicken hit the nail on the head in flavor. I wanted to eat the whole thing myself. Majority of plates are for sharing and they will customize the amount of food on the plate (one or two more) so everyone can enjoy the selections. We wrapped the meal up with Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sunday topped with pretzels, Butterscotch Pudding, and a few had Milk Shake Birthday Cake Shots. The pudding will always be a favorite of mine. I loved that they carried much of the New York layout and decor into this new location. The music was great and it kept the atmosphere fun. The wait staff was fantastic! Plates were cleared and drinks were filled very efficiently, they all worked well together to not be on the way and replace dishes and flatware swiftly. Props to them! I will definitely be coming back along with my friends! It's a good balance of high end restaurant without the stuffy atmosphere. I recommend you try it.",

I'm all for quick service, but this was far too quick for a sit down dinner. We loved the atmosphere so much we sat at the bar after dinner. Next time, I will be more slow to order to properly enjoy the evening a bit longer. I will also mention, I'm a lightweight, I ordered 2 drinks during our 45 min dinner and another at the bar afterward. All martinis. I didn't feel the slightest bit tipsy, and after 3 martinis in less than 2 hours, I should have been stumbling home. Thinking the pours were quite weak.",

    "text": "Had to open up a yelp review just for this place. I live and dine in Vegas. Have no problem spending money on quality food and service. You will not receive quality here.  Had reservations for a small group and was seated in the lounge with tables below your knees. The noise level was so loud that a conversation was impossible. The food was not bad but was not worth the price charged. We tried the Mac n cheese, raviolis, hamachi, some pasta, grill cheese and tomato soup, over cooked sliders, ahi tacos, some other stuff too, nothing memorable. Saw the tomahawk ribeye that our neighbor ordered for $125 and laughed. Was not about to order that piece of sh#t. Bill was $985, with tip $1200. The desert was mediocre, no one finished it, yet we were still hungry. Left still hungry but wasn't about to order anything more. If you're getting tapas pass this place up and go to Fire Flies (salmonella isn't that bad), better yet go to yard house, food is the same quality but will fill you up. You are paying purely for the hype. Go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, Carnivino, Le Cirque, Joel Robuchon, Strip Steak, L'Atelier, Blue Ribbon (when they where open), all are high end dinning with a price tag to match, but you will leave with an experience that was worth it. There are so many good restaurants in Vegas. I feel used after leaving this place. Rarely in my 20 years of living in Vegas have I felt this way. On a positive, our service was excellent. It did not feel like you were in a 5 star restaurant, more like a club/ lounge but our waitress was attentive. I would not blame her for our experience. If the price was 1/3 of what we were charged they would receive 4 stars but with their prices comes expectations, that were not met. I also cannot say we were shocked when we saw the bill, actually thought it would be more, just disappointed every time food was delivered. Pass on this place and go to a restaurant that cares about the food they serve. Price does not always equal quality.",

The grilled cheese-tomato soup dumplings were so good I couldn't speak after the first bite. My friend described it as a party in the mouth. It was crazy good. We also tried the kale/apple salad, salmon, Thai BBQ chicken, and tuna poke tacos. All amazing.",

If an F-16 was taking off from Seattle Seahawks stadium with Aerosmith playing over the loud speakers, it would have been quieter than Beauty and Essex. I sat in a booth with my wife and daughter. I was on one end, my wife on the other and daughter in the middle. My wife and I gave up trying to talk to each other and just used our daughter as go-between.   Another thing I noticed is that the guy holding the door open to the pawn shop that precedes the restaurant has yet to smile...ever!  Our food was great. The tuna tacos were our favorite. The service was nice and especially accommodating. And the layout, decor and vibe were all cool as could be.  And it's loud. Did I say that already!  Smiley face",

    "text": "Second time at B&E in Vegas in 2 weeks. You've read all the food reviews so I won't detail those here except to say that it can be hit or miss. The first time our Short Ribs Mac and Cheese was dry; better last night but still not very creamy. Steaks were totally over salted but this is the \"newer\" way of cooking and is my problem.  Two issues that prevented them from being higher starred:  1) noise level 2) presumptuousness of the servers  I get that hip vibe that noise is exciting and makes everyone think this is the place to be. But both times I have come home with a sore throat from having to literally yell at the person across the table from me. At least last night the music wasn't as loud. But the acoustics are just flat out awful. I'm not looking for a fine restaurant ambience with servers talking to you in hushed tones, but when the servers can't hear me/me them and I can't hear my friends, its a problem.  2) Both times I've found the servers a bit presumptuous and last night, even bordering on rude. Apparently last night the server asked the table if there were any dietary restrictions; well perhaps because of the noise level, perhaps because he didn't speak loud enough or make sure we were all noticing he was talking (I certainly didn't), I didn't hear him to tell him about my issue with seafood.  When he came back and I inquired about the appetizers which he ordered (they like to do that there, the server decides what to bring you) and their seafood/fish content, his response was arrogant and blaming me for not hearing him. \"I stood right here and asked and no one said anything\". He did not apologize and of course, the entire first course of appetizers was fish. I will say that he took care when ordering the side dishes for our main and made sure they were seafood free.  We had a large table of 10 and when he returned to take our entree orders, I wasn't ready (this was a business dinner and we were talking shop). I asked him to come back to me and he refused, responding \"I'll tell you what to have\". I'm sure he meant it in a confident, \"we have a lot of great things here and let me advise you\" sort of manner but it came off as condescending especially when its a man speaking to a woman. If I had wanted his \"advice\" I'd had asked for it. He did the same to another female patron at our table who was eating gluten free vegetarian - talked down to her, basically told her there was very little on the menu for her. I get that you don't like dietary restrictions but staff doesn't need to be rude about it.  Otherwise the food is good, the decor is lovely albeit very dimly lit (hard to read menus), drinks typical Vegas overpricing ($17 for a cocktail) but its nothing special in a town full of great places to eat.",

    "text": "Well, if you read the other Yelp reviews you would think this place is really great. Not so much. We got a res at 6:30 because we drove in late from CA. The four of us sat down for a relaxing meal and to chill on a Friday night. It was not to be.  The cute and well groomed server waited on us in a timely manner but from the outset we got the \"bums rush\". Not within 5 minutes we were asked if we were ready to order, really? Come on, this is not a cheap dinner. You expect a different level of service. The server also had not mastered the art of peripheral vision necessary to be an excellent server. When one of your customers is waiving to get your attention, you should immediately respond rather than whisk by the table without a glance.  I do agree that the pawn shop entry is novel and kind of fun but the rest of the interior architecture was disappointing. The decor was not the problem but rather the open floor plan that resulted in an extreme level of noise such that you could barely hear each other at a table of four. Unacceptable! You are about to drop $100 a head, you should be able to enjoy your meal.  Now, the important aspect of any review, the food. WTF, the menu read better than the food tasted. While I applaud the small plates concept, it creates a great deal of pressure on the chef to produce distinctive vibrant tastes within the small portion offered. This they did not accomplish. If you have been to Spain, Joel Robuchon or any of the similar high quality small plate outstanding chefs, you know exactly what I mean.  The tomato soup and grilled cheese spoon offering is a good example. Great idea, poor execution. The tastes were muddled and largely unremarkable. The fire roasted corn and scallops also were a good menu idea but again nothing remarkable. Each separate ingredient was good but nothing to bind them together. The salmon dish was overcooked, an inexcusable tragedy for any fish but especially salmon. The sauce with the fish nothing to add any distinctive taste but a useless addition. The brussels  Sprouts were well prepared and perhaps the tastiest thing about the meal. Companion ordered the beef filet a poivre that was well constructed but essentially tasteless. What a shame to waste a descent piece of beef. And finally, the dessert. Tried the $6 root beer float, 2 oz of root beer and ice cream float-maybe a little too small even for a small plate restaurant.  I would not return to this restaurant and cannot in any context recommend it. They I am sure will do fine because it is Vegas. However, there are too many other good choices in the new culinary capital that Vegas has become.",

She had great suggestions for us both visits and some ideas for things to do after! We had the tomato soup dumplings, fried shrimp and papaya salad, onion rings, hamachi, empanadas and the peanut butter sundae. All excellent choices. The soup dumplings are served on soup spoons with cheese wontons nestled in tomato soup. Such a different take on a classic! Very fun to eat and share. Hamachi was clean and fresh. They were so good, we ordered them twice. The shrimp and papaya salad was filling and perfectly fried. The acid in the papaya salad played nicely off of the shrimp. Empanadas were great, perfectly crisp. Onion rings were stacked high and delectably crunchy. The peanut butter sundae was crazy good. I'll be dreaming of that marshmallow fluff for months.  Excellent place. Definitely recommending it to all my friends.",

The temperature of the soup was tepid and the surface temperature of the dumpling was just warm. They come in bite sized portions so I just popped that little sucker in and molten hot cheese squirted onto the roof of my mouth. I also ordered one of their gimlets the waitress recommended and it was disgustingly strong. It's a cute place but super crowded and LOUD, the hotel itself is pretty cute but you will encounter Young drunk idiots who can't handle their liquor. I saw a drunk topless girl try to get her drunk friend off the bathroom floor to no avail and an hour later found a drunk girl who had fallen and smashed her face against something (HUGE lump on forehead) she was laying on the floor covered in her own vomit. This all happened BEFORE 6pm on a Friday!!!! They have no problem serving young adults who have clearly had too many stiff ass drinks that  a seasoned drinker can't even drink!",

    "text": "My husband and I dined here on Valentine's Day during a whirlwind trip in Vegas. We live in Queens, NY and have dined at the Manhattan location, but we had not realized they had opened a Vegas location until just two nights before Valentine's Day when we were waiting for the Bellagio's fountain show and saw their sign on the side of the Cosmopolitan. When we managed to snag a 10PM reservation on OpenTable, we canceled our booking at Gordon Ramsay Steak, and-- though I do not know what we might have missed out on at Gordon Ramsay Steak-- I am not sorry we decided to spend our evening at Beauty & Essex.   The Drinks: I ordered the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mmm... think smoky mezcal and citrus) and my husband had the Woodsman (Also very good... think deep bourbon with well-balanced maple and citrus notes).   The Food: Between the two of us we shared 4 Maine lobster rolls-- fresh lobster salad served on impressive little \"rolls\" made of crispy corn dog batter; 6 grilled cheese, smoked bacon, and tomato soup dumplings-- savory, smoky, grilled cheese dumplings nested over a rich tomato puree; and 4 chile relleno empanadas-- crisp, fluffy pockets stuffed with a smooth cheese and a mild to medium poblano sauce.   The Service: All staff, ranging from the doorman and the hostess to the servers and bussers were friendly and welcoming. Despite the restaurant's exclusive appeal (its pawn shop facade, speakeasy vibe, and dramatically intimate decor) the staff was very friendly and welcoming and before we left we had a wonderful chat with one of the waitresses [her name escapes me-- grr!] who recommended we visit Santos' sister restaurant, \"Vandal\" when we returned to New York.   In summary, I highly recommend a visit to Beauty & Essex to anyone looking to splurge on a high quality cocktail and an array of small bites in a romantically hip ambiance.",

I was so excited my husband surprised me and made reservations here because he knew I had been wanting to try it. First thing that bummed me out alittle bit was they they sat us at one of those two top tables like at Cheesecake Factory where you are next to two other tables (Almost sitting on top of) normally it wouldn't bother me but it was our anniversary and my husband said that when he made the reservation. After that I was still not completely upset until our food came. We order the ribeye steak medium plus and I said to the waitress I don't like a lot of pink...which mind you was 125 dollars. Not only did it come out in my opinion pretty rare.... it was COLD and on a COLD plate. Maybe I'm wrong but i thought when you pay that kind of money your food should be correct and hot. By this point i was so disappointed we didn't even stay for dessert not that they did anything for that either. The only nice part of the night was when the manger came over to check he actually seemed like he cared and tried to have a conversation. I don't like to complain and so I didn't say anything and now i regret it because we are clearly that bummed out. Stick to other places when selecting where to other eat",

The ambiance and environment was really very beautiful with a vintage and romantic feel, which begins which begins with you walking through a pawn shop to enter. The server did a complete review of the menu with us, seemingly pushing specific items from the menu. He encouraged cocktails over the wine menu, but I ended up handing mine to my husband because it was too sweet for me.  The food was New American but also resembled tapas. This place was also pretty expensive for the amount of food you get.  The menu boasted lots of small, sharable plates, which allowed us to try several things. Here's the rundown of what we ate. We tried: 'Chile Relleno' Empanadas - cheesy, bland flavor Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings- my favorite thing we tried, but my husband was annoyed by the presentation (served in Asain soup spoons) Broccolini with garlic, soy, chile- strong on the soy sauce, but pretty good Short Rib 'Mac & Cheese' with pickled jalapeno, herb cornbread crust- meh, I could barely notice any short rib meat & overall bland for mac & cheese Cocktails: Emerald Gimlet- husband gave it a B+ Bubbles & Berries- too sweet for me",

Oh I wanted a couple of those antique bracelets - they have  merchandise buyer on board with a great eye!    The appetizers are pricey $12/per but worth it.  Those carrots are spectacular and crunchy crunchy onion rings.  My salad was delicious and my companions loved their scallops.   Worth the price.",

    "text": "I never knew this place was even a restaurant until I saw it on yelp.  I actually thought it was a freaking jewelry pawn shop ... *facePalmNutz.    Anyway, while the prices are Vegas Strip premium here, a lot of their dishes were on point.  Roasted Bone Marrow - This dish was fantastic.  The bone marrow was cooked to perfection as well as the carmelized onions.  I kid you not though, the place that sets this place apart was the bread.  Something about that buttery garlicy-ness sets it off.    French Onion soup dumplings - While the cheese they used was really good, I didn't care too much for this dish.  I was expecting soupy dumplings...like a french onion soup xiaLongBao.  All you get is a dumpling filled with carmelized onions.    Grilled cheese , bacon, and tomato soup dumplings - This was more my style.  There was actual soup this this.  Too bad they don't serve this by the bowl.  Thai style deep fried shrimp - Great dish.  The shrimp was good quality and the slaw was perfect.  Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - Ordered this by somehow it came with a bunch of pepperoni and meat.  I wonder if this was intentional?  This dish was okay.  Never thought I'd say this but there was actually too much meat too the point where it made the pizza too salty.  Brussel Sprouts - They could have done a better job carmelizing the outside of the brussel sprouts but this dish was solid.  It was a bit soggy because it soaked up too much oil.  Short rib mac and cheese - I liked how the short rib flavor got into the guts of the cheese flavor.    Basil Pesto ravioli with Rock shrimp - I wasn't a fan of this dish as it was bland.  It had the least impact in terms of flavor.    Jerk Spiced chicken - While the flavor was good, the chicken came out a bit dry.  Tear.  Scallops - Good quality scallops.  Can't go wrong here.  Devils food layer cake - Imagine the richest and sweetest chocolate cake of all time. It was nice that the did have the milk ice cream to \"lighten\" the load.  If they eased up on the sugar, I would have enjoyed this dessert much more.  Drinks: I had the Electric Avenue which is pretty much their own version of a manhattan.  While it isn't cheap at $17, it was really good.  Compare this to the Chandelier bar outside the restaurant that serves a sh*tty old fashioned for $17.  It's expensive, but you get more value here.  They also have pitchers of Sangria, but that'll set you back $80.  Did I mention this place isn't cheap?  Service was good and for the most part, the food was tasty.  If you have a large party, this place is great because you can order it \"tapas\" style.  For example, you can add one scallop to the scallop dish.  The waiter/waitress will help you along the way.    4 stars!",

The food is off the charts and the service (Ian is our favorite, but we had a great experience with Apollo last night) is spot on! The staff is knowledgeable, attentive, and great at pairing dishes. The noise level is pretty darn high, but depending on where you're seated, you can still have a conversation. It's hard to highlight the winners - since there are so many - but the Thai Fried Shrimp, K-Town Bair Burgers, Mexican Street Corn Ravioli and steaks are consistently amazing! Oh, and the desserts are phenomenal. We will continue to go back over and over!",

Blue cheese stuffed olives in martini weren't fresh. The tapas were just ok - we got the Korean fried chicken, Chile relleno empanadas and fried shrimp. The pretzel ice cream sundae was good but tasted like peanut butter overload.",

We tried:  The Woodsman $17 Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Allspice Dram, Maple Syrup, Lemon, Muddled Pears  The Garrison $17 Basil Hayden's Bourbon, Mount Gay 'Black Barrel' Rum, Fonseca 'Bin 27' Port, Sour - Both drinks with Bourbon were lackluster.  Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon &  Tomato Soup Dumplings $18 - Cute and tasty but not worth $20.  Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings $12 miso honey mustard and sambal ketchup - Onion rings, good but not outstanding.  Short Rib 'Mac & Cheese' pickled jalapeno herb cornbread crust $18 - Not enough cheese, not enough short ribs. Pass on this and try something else.  Elote Style Scallops 33 charred corn salad, chipotle, lime, cilantro - Exactly as expected and described. Get it!  Grilled Double Cut Lamb Chops 44 port wine glaze - Delicious, juicy and prefectly cooked at medium.  \"Strawberry Shortcake\" Bars 11 liquid cheesecake, white chocolate, cap'n crunch - Liquid cheesecake was interesting but the cap n' crunch was far too sugary.  Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme 13 coconut chantilly - Exactly as expected. No complaints.  Glad I had a gift card.  1 star for the Lamb Chops, 1 star for the Scallops.

Ahi tuna tacos, sashimi, a tomato bisque spoon, a french onion-and-mushroom on a stick... honestly the best thing was the lobster roll, which really wasn't special at all.  Even the \"s'mores\" dessert was more a brownie covered in marshmallow whip rather than anything resembling a s'more as they were hoping. I admire the ambition but somewhere along the line they should've realized it was a gigantic miss in execution.",

No idea if they stay in business because the drinks are strong and everyone is drunk or what. We went for my birthday and I have to say it was the worst birthday meal I've ever had. The yellowtail sashimi was drown in sauce. It was too salty. You couldn't even taste the fish or try to appreciate it's flavor. The pickled jalapenos were the best part. Too bad they were microscopic.  Thai-style deep fried shrimp. They didn't look or tasted fried. That was confusing. The shrimp was cook well, great size but no flavor! The only thing hinting at Thai was the green papaya slaw.  Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. It's really hard to mess up cheese and bacon,right? This was the best dish. I'm just not sure if it was the best because it was the only flavorful one or if it was really good on it's own. If I had ordered it on it's own and tasted nothing else, would I have still enjoyed it so much?  Oven Braised Chicken Meatball. Nothing special. No flavor other than the ricotta.  Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings. They were huge, crispy. That was a plus. My favorite part of the entire meal was the housemade spicy mustard and ketchup. How sad that that was the most flavor the entire meal.   I didn't bother with dessert. I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was really disappointing. I think I would have been more satisfied anywhere else. I felt bad that my husband paid for this meal.",

    "text": "On the first night of our recent stay at the Cosmopolitan, we were wandering around reading the menus of the new restaurants.  Beauty & Essex's menu intrigued me but it was the description of the \"Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup dumplings\" that was on my mind for days.    On the afternoon of our last day, I could no longer resist and booked a last minute reservation.    The front of the restaurant is a small pawn shop with a security guard outside.  Don't be offput by the guard.  This isn't a club nor is it overly snobby.  The inside of the restaurant is dark but decorated in a way that makes it more clubby than dismal.  What you would expect for Vegas.  Our reservation time was pretty early because of being booked at the last minute.  There were a good number of tables already in the full swing of dinner.  I was glad that they didn't seat us right next to anyone.  In fact, I noticed that they carefully seated people so that they had as much privacy as is possible.  I truly appreciate that at a time when many restaurants seem to seat tables for the comfort of the servers and not the customers.  We were promptly greeted by Roszettie, our server.  She was super knowledgeable of the menu and offered to make all of the dishes served as even numbers because there were just two of us.  Given our varying tastes, we declined, but it was an offer that you don't get everywhere.  I ordered the Emerald Gimlet \" Absolut 'Elyx' Vodka, Basil, Lemon Nectar, Fresh Lime\".  It didn't disappoint.  The fresh smell of the drink was almost as enticing as the flavor.  It was also a great palate cleanser.    We had four of the dishes.  1.  The Tuna Poke Tacos - both of our favorites.  A small crispy taco shell with tuna poke, soy, radishes, etc.  The flavor, crunch, heat, etc. was perfectly balanced.    2.  The Lobster roll - My husband's second favorite and my least favorite (of the four, it was still excellent).  The roll is either made in house or they are delivered daily because they couldn't have been fresher.  The roll had a sweetness that enhanced the lobster salad.    3.  The Bone Marrow - I am a lover of bone marrow.  One very large bones split lengthwise into two pieces.  As a note to Chris Santos, the celebrity Chopped judge who lends his name to this restaurant, the marmalade and salad didn't really seem to have a purpose and could have been left off the plate.  All this dish needs is the marrow and the crispy, fresh, buttered bread chunks.  4.  The Tomato Soup Dumpling - while good they were a little misleading.  The soup is not in the dumpling (one of the reasons I ordered it was to see how they got it in there without it getting soggy).  It was a small, crispy, bacon & cheese dumpling resting in a spoon of tomato soup.  The soup was excellent without being overly acidic.  It was a perfect complement to the dumpling.  I can not say enough good things about Roszettie and the rest of the employees.  They were professional and courteous and each item came out as we finished the prior one.    I did have to chuckle at the self promotion postcard regarding Chopped and Food Network that arrived with the check.  It was unnecessary and cheapened the overall feel of the restaurant and the meal somehow.  My biggest regret is that we didn't eat here sooner because it wouldn't have been the only time during this trip.  Hopefully it will survive the grind that is the Vegas restaurant industry and will be here for our next trip.",

    "text": "This is my first time to Beauty and Essex, and I really loved everything about it. When you walk in the idea of the pawnshop makes you feel like you've entered a speakeasy. The interior of the restaurant is stunningly beautiful it looks like the inside of a jewelry box with found objects everywhere. The walls and carpet are warm deep tone that create a wonderful soothing environment. The chandelier in the main dining room is stunning and has just enough light. Our waitress introduced herself and explained about the dishes being shared. The first dish that we tried was the tomato soup with grilled cheese. The soup was a little bit on the cool side and probably would've stayed warmer if it was filled higher. I can understand how it would be difficult to keep a small amount of soup warm in a plastic spoon. The grilled cheese bits were buttery and delicious.  The next appetizer that we tried was the deep-fried Thai shrimp which was very tasty. We have three people in our party and it was just enough for everybody to have two pieces. Next came the ravioli and mushroom pizza. The mushroom pizza had lots of caramelized onions and truffle oil which were very delicious. We all really enjoyed the ravioli, the sauce was great. There was definitely an issue with keeping many of the items warm enough at the table. Our ravioli was cold too. I think it would be really helpful if they were serving things on warm plates it would help to keep things hot as they come to the table. One of the main issues that I had with this restaurant was that the waitress said that everything was shared but in reality only the appetizers are shared.  There was a problem with the way things were brought out we ordered two entrees and the pizza for an entree main dishes and unfortunately only two entrees came out together. So one person in our party was left with nothing to eat while the other people were eating their entrees. That was very unfortunate and left everybody feeling a little uncomfortable.  I feel like our server could've done a much better job explaining things and maybe she does not understand that the entrees are not shareable.   All in all it was a wonderful experience we also had a delicious dessert which was a marscapone cheese filled chocolate cake.  I highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be back next time I visit Vegas. I think this is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas even with the flaws.  I feel like next time I would be better at ordering since I understand how the restaurant works.  On the way out stop by the mirror and take a cute video it will be sent to you.",

    "text": "We came here last night to celebrate one of my best friend's birthday/graduation. Her husband had made reservations for 8:00pm. We got there and they said the table was not ready. We didn't get seated till around 8:20pm. I don't understand the concept of making a reservation when you still need to wait?  The restaurant was incredibly loud and you could barely hear what anyone is saying. We sat at a small round table. Our waiter was on the other side of the table talking and I couldn't catch anything he was saying so no idea what his name was either. The noise didn't bother us but for others who are looking for something more intimate, this isn't it.   SERVICE - I felt like this was very poor last night. It took our waiter forever to come back to take our drink order. My two friends said \"I have not even seen our waiter again. Did he forget about us\"? So after awhile, we ordered drinks. I would say took 15-20min for those to come out. Even when we ordered food, that didn't come out until 9:25pm. Sometimes when it takes awhile for your food to come, you don't notice it too much because though the wait is long...it's not THAT long. This was one of those waits where your entire table kind of has the realization of \"Wow they are slow. Our food is STILL not here\". And not to mention, we all got our food except for the main guest...our friend celebrating her birthday/graduation. After about 10min of waiting, we had to flag down our waiter to remind him that we were still waiting for her food!   DRINKS - The drinks were not bad but not very strong either.   FOOD Short Rib Mac n Cheese - This was tasty and the flavor was good. Only thing missing was the short rib. We didn't find very many pieces of meat in this.   Spaghettini - Our friend got this dish and he said it was \"too good to be True\" regarding the noodles being zucchini. He really liked this one.   Garganelli - This wasn't as good as we hoped. It had a very strong tomato based sauce.   Beauty & Essex Burger - This was a very juicy burger. The meat was not even close to dry so it was well cooked. Flavor wise, I wasn't crazy about it. It was a little bland in my opinion.   BBQ Fries - This was the star of the night. Perfectly crisp fries seasoned w BBQ.   Overall, it's a beautiful restaurant. Very hip and the ambiance was great. Service wasn't amazing. Food was okay.",

If you want a place for a quiet dinner this is not it, loud, raucous, dark, trendy, all the above. The place is mainly a small dish tapas sort of place. We started with tuna poke tacos, these will go down as some of the best appetizers I've ever eaten. My least favorite menu item was the Korean fried chicken, the chicken could've been a little bit hotter. They came on of bed of pickled cucumbers and kimchi. The sausage cavatelli was spectacular as was our side of sh peppers were great as well.   OK this is our second visit and I wanted to update my review. First time was not a fluke. The food was just as good the second time, maybe even better. I upgrade my review to 5-stars. My new favorite restaurant in Vegas. Loud, noisy and buzzing.  Don't come here for a quiet getaway. Just really delicious food.",

You enter through a pawn shop, where everything is 70% off according to the hostesses (at least that's what I think she said) and there's a side door that leads to the entrance of the restaurant.  It's pretty dark in there but the place is very plush and romantic - lots of velvet couches, crystal chandeliers and peacock feathers everywhere.  I love peacocks!  I enjoyed the Beauty Elixir cocktail to start.  I was hoping to was an actual elixir that would beautify me but it was just gin, strawberries and sparking rose, garnished with a cucumber.  It was delicious and refreshing.  I ordered the Garganelli pasta with a lamb bologenese.  When it arrived, it came in a pretty little bowl with Parmesan and red pepper chili flakes  poured out on the side.  Cute presentation.  The entree itself was pretty good but I wasn't blown out of the water by it.  I definitely think it was a bit overpriced and I probably could've gotten a bigger portion size.  I finished with the Peanut Butter Sundae.  A fun dessert presented in an old fashion sundae bowl, topped with loads of chocolate syrup, whipped cream and mini pretzels.  I liked the peanut butter ice cream; I could have done without all the other stuff added on top for looks.  Overall, it was a great place.  Nice ambiance but very crowded and a bit pricey.",

    "text": "Let me start off this review by admitting that i really dislike the frou-frou \"new American\" cuisine trend where it seems restaurants are just dressing up a pork chop with an apple \"reduction\" and charging $50 for it. But now that I've been to Beauty & Essex a couple times, I feel like this place is legit.  Hands down, my favorite dish on the menu is actually the garganelli. It's hearty but with just enough kick at the end to make it really interesting. My other must-haves are the tomato soup dumplings and chicken meatballs. The caesar toast is my favorite of the toast offerings but to be honest I like all of them; the wedge salad is also killer but I'd prioritize other, more interesting / different things on the menu first.  And don't forget dessert. The affogato milkshake shot (an affogato with godiva liquer) is one of my top guilty pleasures anywhere - I'll admit I don't usually even wait until dessert to have one.  I don't know why they've taken some of their best offerings off the menu (french onion soup dumplings?) but this is still a place I always look forward to visiting.",

We made 645 reservations and barely made it (they will hold for 15 minutes and then it's on a tbd basis).   Order small plates to share! So many delicious shareable plates. The French onion soup dumplings (6 to an order) and the yellowtail sashimi is amazing (6 slices to an order). I wanted to try it all!  I loved how flexible they are with custom orders - no bacon. Cheese on side. Light sauce. Didn't feel like it was a burden to ask.  Lighting is dim and the space is a little tight but it's a great atmosphere from initiate dinners or larger groups!",

The burgers, tacos, Mac n cheese, meatballs, carrots , carrot cake, ice cream, tandoori chicken, tomato and Gilles cheese soup were all a party I my mouth. I love the guitars and the pawn shop when you first walk in ......you would've never known there is a restaurant behind those doors. I promise you won't be disappointed.

Their service, drinks and food were all on point!  It was my first time at this restaurant chain, and it definitely didn't disappoint.  I had a great first impression.  Our favorites for the night included chicken meatballs and grilled cheese and tomato bites.  I also enjoyed the chicken arepas and Tuna tacos.  For dessert, it was strawberry shortcake bars and doughnuts.  Deliciousness!!!!  It's family style, tapas type dining so we ordered plates to share amongst us.  Portions were on the smaller side, and some dishes only included about 3 pieces but we left full and satisfied.  We tasted a good portion of food, and ordered more of what we loved.  There's so much more that I wanted to try but my stomach did not allow LOL.  There will be another future dining experience here for me soon! The ambience was what stood out to me the most, it was absolutely perfect.",

    "text": "I have heard great things about B&E, which opened about a year or some ago in LA. Fancy, shiny, and bougie - all the criteria above desired when choosing a dinner spot to reunite with one of my best friends! We decided we wanted to glam up on a Saturday night and there was indeed, not a more perfect spot. First and foremost, my experience was probably one of the best dining experiences I've ever ever had. Location, service, food selection, style, taste, and company- all were remarkable 10/10.   We ordered:  1. Old fashioned: one with the reserve whiskey option and a second with the makers option. Then a shot of bourbon for a fun activity (see #4). All the great food that is about to be listed was later 'wasted' because of this decision here. But still, worth it! 2. Yellowtail sashimi : this came first and was really refreshing. I love the acidity and the dressings that came on top. A great starter to really prepare your palette for the great things about to come next.  3. Dumplings in tomato soup : presentation was beautiful. 6 perfect spoon bites prepared beautifully. The cheese in the dumplings mixed well with the saltiness of the tomato soup. Warm and a play on texture.  4. Bone Marrow: my favorite dish. 3 bones with flakey toast assembled in a jenga-like manner, served with a marmalade and salt on the side. I have to admit that one bone did not have any marrow which was disappointed but nearly forgotten because of how tremendous everything else was. It was buttery and the marmalade paired with it harmoniously. We also poured down bourbon shots into the bone marrow- a fun experience but taste is .. well, bourbon.  5. The scallops: buttery freaking goodness. When you read reviews and they say \"get this!\" .. yeah, it's definitely an understatement. These scallops were cooked like I've never tasted them before. They melted in my mouth and the puree underneath was just a bonus. I could eat a hundred of these. It was the perfect end to an amazing meal.   Our waitress, Erin, was the best waitress I've ever had. She was fun, bubbly, and seriously had the cutest personality. I literally wanted to befriend her so badly, but that would be creepy (only slightly). She gave recommendations, advised if we ordered too much, showed us how to take our bone marrow shots, took videos of it for us (with commentary), and even told us that we should go to Marquee because they stamp us for free access when you eat at B&E, which led us to a full an fun night even after our already tremendous dining experience. Erin, you are so cool!",

    "text": "I liked Beauty & Essex for a lot of reasons. The restaurant is comfortable, tables are nicely spaced, it has a unique design and concept and the service is very good.  The menu is eclectic and defies classification and because of this there should be something available for most people.  Food is nicely presented and while most portions are not huge they are sufficient enough if a few items are ordered. Everything we had was okay and nothing overtly offensive was on my plate but just about everything was in the \"not bad\" category.  Chicken meatballs were okay, Korean fried chicken was also okay and donuts for dessert were okay and that's the problem, while everything was decent, nothing really was outstanding.   Beauty & Essex is more of a concept restaurant that is part gimmicky but its certainly not a bad place and there are many worse options in Vegas. It is a good place for drinks and an escape from the noise and chaos in Vegas.",

What our party of 4 experienced at the Vegas location of Beauty & Essex was one of the top ten meals I have had alltime.  I highly recommend going to the restaurant with a party of 4 as almost all of the items on the menu come out tapas style that are perfectly sized for 4 people.    The restaurant is all Vegas.  Dark and bustling, but the service is friendly and our server was particularly knowledgeable on the food.  All in all we had 14 dishes (3 of those were desserts) without a miss in the entire bunch.  Each and every dish I would order again, but the cool thing about the menu is that there were so many other items on the menu that sounded delicious that we didn't get to try.  Makes a return trip inevitable.    Too many dishes to describe each, but the standouts among the standouts were the Tomato Tartare, Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup dumplings, Mexican Street Corn Ravioli, Double Barrel Pork Chop al Pastor, and the Chorizo Carbonara mac & Cheese.    Just outstanding, not much else to add.",

We ended up getting a few sharing plates AND our own meals because it all looked so good. I'd recommend this place to anyone!  We started with the grilled cheese and tomato soup spoons which were incredible. The mini grilled cheese had so much flavor pack into such a little bite I was very impressed and highly recommend these to anyone! (They were able to put bacon in the side as one of us were vegetarian). The crab rolls were also purchased and great as well.  The three main courses we all five start as well. We got the burger, ravioli, and spaghettini. I got the spaghettini which comes perfectly topped with an egg in top. The pesto is a little atypical but still fantastic. It doesn't look like much payday when it's all wound up but as soon as you dig i. You realize how large the portion is.   It was great getting a very high end meal in a nice hotel for a very reasonable price. It was nice to be able to treat ourselves with out spending a crazy amount of money.   Service was really great. Our server Ian was very attentive without being overbearing and had great recommendations for our orders. Also like mentioned early was very accommodating with the vegetarian requirements. Also they have us a free birthday shot as it was one of our 21st so definitely ask about that if you are celebrating!",

The service was a miss and although they have a separate vegan and a gluten free menu, the plates just lacked finesse. The description on the brussel sprouts sounded amazing without the bacon but what I got was plain Brussels with salt and pepper to make it vegan which is not what i was expecting. This is after they brought out the dish with bacon first after telling them I'm vegan. My husband ordered onion soup meat balls which were hard and nasty and the cheese around it was wayyyyy too much. The chicken meatballs came with cold cheese and looked too mushy. Empanadas were good and the slider was decent.   Def order the BBQ fries as it was the only good thing on the menu for those who are vegan and gluten free. The sweet and savory fries were fried to perfection and paired with some spicy ketchup, this dish alone would make me come back ten more times but only for the fries. The tofu dish I ordered for my main meal was $30 and came with three tiny grilled pieces of tofu which were seasoned with salt and pepper and not much more. The parsnip puree was delicious but the entire dish was boring compared to many other places in the same casino.   Surprised by the service and meal. It was overall a very mediocre experience.",

    "text": "I had never heard of this place before, but when my hubby took me to the Cosmopolitan for a surprise birthday dinner he stopped in front of a trinket shop. This is it! Huh? So we walked into this TINY store, around to the back, and opened up a door that led to a MASSIVE restaurant. WHAAATTT? Amazingly cool surprise. The food is a similar style to Rose Rabbit Lie, in that it's small portions that are meant to be shared, so you get to try a little bit of everthing. And we most definately did. The server suggested 5 items would be good, but we decided to stuff ourselves and went for 6 + dessert. Tuna Poke Wonton tacos - really fresh but way too spicy for me. Hubs loved them, though Roasted Bone Marrow - This was a hail mary because we've been wanting to try it for awhile. On it's own, we weren't fans, but add the frills they serve with it, very good. Brussel Sprout Salad - TRY THIS!!!! It was my favorite out of everything. Grilled Cheese, Bacon, and Tomato soup dumplings - The soup was so flavorful and the \"dumplings\" were potato (I think) filled with melted cheese topped with bacon. AMAZING! Lamb Chops - another try this! Delicious and huge! K-town Bao Burgers- Good flavor, but too spicy for me Reverse S'mores bites - They were ok, but I was pretty full by then All in all it was an amazing meal. I would love to see more places that do this style of food.",

We left hungry and the food was awful.  The steak was mediocre at best.  To be honest, outback has better steaks. The server was great but the food was tiny and awful.  Not to mention, I told them it was our anniversary and I wanted it to be special.   The girl on the phone tells me congrats we'll be giving you a free dessert with your dinner.  I didn't expect that but I thought that's a cool touch. Did we get a free dessert,  NO. We paid for it like everything else.  A $200 dinner that was awful and we left hungry.  Never never never eating here again and highly recommend you don't either.",

Let get straight to the point and say the food was BOMB! My favorite was the grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato dumplings. Usually when I order grilled cheeses anywhere else I make sure to get an order of tomato soup to dip the sandwich in there. The fact that each bite spoonful of each dumpling had tomato soup was just exquisite. I will be trying the one out in NY soon. Hopefully it's as good as this one in Vegas.",

    "text": "Step inside Beauty & Essex and your initial reaction may be, \"where the restaurant and what kind of miniature pawn shop is this?\". Well, the postage stamp-sized, pawn shop-themed retail spot acts as a fake front for the restaurant, presenting no hint of what lies beyond the secret door.  Fortunately, what's inside rocks. There's a sexy interior dressed in necklaces swinging from gilded frames and most importantly, a creative and tasty menu to match.  The restaurant offers guests the same approachable comfort food served at the original location. To start, there are fun tomato soup dumplings. They're served on Chinese spoons and wrapped like Chinese dumplings, but with a grilled cheese and bacon filling, the flavors are pure comfort American treats.  Fans of red sauce cuisine might initially sneer at a deconstructed garganelli. The bowl of pasta arrives with an artful (or pretentious, depending on your perspective) arrangement of chili flakes and cheese on the side. But a hearty ladleful of lamb Bolognese and a rich whipped ricotta topping will remind you of nonna at first bite.  Beauty & Essex is a pretty place for pretty people to nibble and sip--a perfect fit for the Cosmopolitan.",

The atmosphere is very fun and lively, with a DJ playing awesome music. There are multiple dining rooms so the place is huge, and dim lighting also makes it really fun. There is a fun video booth at the front so you can mess around with it while waiting for your table. We got seated in the largest dining room in the middle which was a great place to sit. We tried the Mexican street corn ravioli (amazing!), the chicken meatballs (amazing!), the salmon (amazing!), the Thai fried shrimp (amazing!). The bone marrow, mac 'n cheese, and tomato soup were also all very good. For dessert we had the donuts which were served warm with three different dipping sauces. This was fantastic! And so was the espresso ice cream which had little bits of espresso in it. Over all I loved the food and vibe of this place and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a fun dinner spot.",

Nothing too great. The decor is great and it looks stylish inside. Love that you walk through a store with Chanel bags for sale to get into the restaurant. I've been to better restaurants with better food and with lower prices. I was very disappointed that the server didn't take my food allergies into consideration. That is very important and I think that's one reason that I'm giving the lower review.",

For a high end brand such as this I would have expected top of the line food and service. Yet the only thing I would give this place a star for is their ambiance.  We ordered a 60 dollar steak which came out cold. We had to hunt someone down to get our server to take it back. They didn't even offer their apologies, never mind provide a credit, when we'd all almost eaten the rest of our meals before it returned.  The scallops were bland with a sweet potato drizzle and peas... really? I could have done better on my own and you only get 3 scallops.  The Mac and cheese was one step up from kraft dinner... shredding some au gratin on it does not make it gourmet...  The drinks were not delicious they were either too sweet or oddly salty. I've never heard of using a celery salt rim for a spicy drink, other than a ceasar and did not compliment the tequila nicely.   Overall, for a 400 dollar bill I wouldn't waste your time. Sad.... just sad! Do better with your customer service, ensure you have enough waters on staff.  Props on the bussers going around topping up water and clearing dishes, plus the music and ambiance was great.",

    "text": "I'll caveat this review by saying that I was very excited to come to Beauty & Essex but for a very specific reason. I had seen the carnival peanut butter sundae online and got it in my head that it was going to be the best dessert ever. Based on other dinner plans and reservations, we decided to come just for late night drinks and dessert. Unfortunately, that's where we went wrong.   The sundae was not what I expected and ended up being pretty trash to be honest. There was a weird thick meringue or marshmallow fluff all over the ice cream. The ice cream itself wasn't very good either and didn't have a strong peanut butter taste. The potato chip that comes with it was overly salty and a little stale.   I'm sure if I came for food my experience would have been different. Our server was very professional and courteous about us basically dropping in to order dessert, and then running out 20 min later when we were unsatisfied (don't worry, we still tipped!). She even offered us to-go cups for our unfinished drinks, which makes a lot of sense, and I wish other places did that!  So long story short.... be careful about what you want here and do your research. I'm sure a lot of the food is great, and probably the other desserts, but don't bother with the carnival sundae.",

Pros: great decor, dimly lit, vegan menu options, accommodating (as we came 30 minutes before our scheduled reservation), free sundae for my birthday   Cons: I did have to give back my plate and ask for a new one because there was food on it before we even stared ordering. Blah! And the dusted tofu had too much of a charred taste for me, I regretted my dish choice and next time will time something else   Tips** I recommend making a reservation, we went on a Wednesday and around 7pm, the place seemed to fill up very quickly",

    "text": "I rarely give restaurants a five star rating as typically I find some things that don't hit the mark. However, our dinner at The Cosmopolitan's Beauty & Essex delivered across the board.  You enter the restaurant through a Pawn Shop located on the Cosmo's third floor. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by multiple staff members. They graciously took my daughter's birthday cake that I brought in for them to present at the end of our meal and escorted us to the lounge to wait for the rest of our party.  There's plenty of stunning photo ops for social media here as the decor is upscale and well done. Once our entire party arrived, we were whisked in to eat.  The service was impeccable! We were there for my daughter's 17th birthday and our server discussed with me ahead of time exactly how we wanted things to go for the evening. They did amazing from the appetizers to the main course and finally to the cake.  As far as their food, I had an Artichoke flatbread which was flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't get photos of all of the food ordered for our party of 11. I was too busy socializing ~ lol! However, everyone had glowing reviews of the food. I'm not one to go without dessert, and I ordered my own carrot cake too. It was hands down the best carrot cake I've had. Moist cake, delicious cream and it comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant. I've had friends recommend it to me previously, and now I have seen first hand why. Finally, a huge thank you to all of the staff who made my daughter's birthday such a special event!! We truly thank you for a memorable evening!",

I ordered the bone marrow again and then the Aged Sirloin medium rare.  The taste and temperature were on point.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent food and service.  I'm a big fan of steakhouses and Beauty and Essex serves up quality filet mignon and sirloin that is just as good if as the best steakhouses around.   The ambience is good for date night or dinner with friends.   Thank you Manuella and Ros for an awesome experience.  The back of house team delivered once again with great tasting food. There's only a couple of restaurants I have to go to when I'm in Las Vegas and this is one of them.",

The waitress (Irene) approaches our table politely and gave us a tour of the menu. We began with cocktails Berry's and bubbles; and exilier (strawberry cucumber) my sister says it's very strong. The berry and bubbles (sour and sweet) you can barley taste the booze. Then we ordered bbq fries and apple and kale salad. They are both very good! Fries remind me of the bbq chips from grade school at the snack shack served with ketchup and mayo. The salad was perfectly balanced in vibrant flavors. For dinner we had the meat balls (salty and savory); and the roasted chicken with the jalapeno cream on the side (very good ! ) I should have had it with the crema on it. An old friend Johnny recognized me and he sent me out birthday dessert",

Came here for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7pm. It wasn't too busy but it definitely picked up as the night went on. (Bar area was crowded, of course). Our waitress informed us everything is served tapas style, it's cool to try different dishes but be warned: your bill racks up QUICK! Our appetizers and drinks alone were already at $96.00.  We ordered the following appetizer items: -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings (6)-one of their most popular/ordered appetizers. My boyfriend loveddddd this. -Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp (5 pieces) -Shishito Peppers  -Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (6) -Yellowtail Sashimi (6) I'm not a big fan of raw fish but this was delicious! You don't taste the fishiness at all. Actually it was very flavorful with the ponzu sauce and pickled jalapenos.  For our main: -Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs (3) -Mexican Street Corn Ravioli (6)-this was another one of their popular items. Literally Mexican street corn in a dish form.   Main dishes may not look like we ordered much, but believe me, we were already full from the appetizers alone!!! As you can see, most items are six pieces or less per dish so plan accordingly if you have a large party if you may want to order two of the same dish.  Our waitress brought us out a complimentary dessert platter (see pic attached). If you're a fan of carrot cake like my boyfriend is, this is a must! Even though he was super duper full from dinner....he still had enough room for that cake. There was no way he was just gonna let that sit there untouched lol.   Being locals, we've been wanting to dine here for over a year now.....glad we finally were able to. Fancy and bougie, Cynthia likes.",

    "text": "I would definitely recommend Beauty & Essex especially if you are staying in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  My husband and I wanted to fancy it up a bit so we started searching online for highly rated restaurants within the vicinity of our hotel.  Luckily Beauty & Essex came out on top and we were staying in the Cosmo so extra bonus.   I would highly recommend reservations.  We got very lucky that they had an opening since I booked our reservation last minute.  The restaurant is a little difficult to find because you first enter a very small store front area, then open a door within there that reveals the restaurant.  I was a little hesitant when we were first approaching the store front thinking that there was another entrance.  But once we explained to the up front help that we had dinner reservations they opened the extra door and we passed through.  There was a bit of a line even to check in for a reservation so that is why I would recommend making one especially if you are more than a party of 2.  The restaurant is a bit on the \"dark\" side of lighting so if that is annoying to you because you can't take fabulous pictures of your food for Yelp than you may want to take a pass.  Other than that please save up some extra bucks to enjoy great food and service from Beauty & Essex.  Our server was fabulous and always on point.  Would check in regularly but not too overbearing.  And the servers helping her we very courteous as well.  This is what my husband and I ordered to share for dinner:  -Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos -Roasted Bone Marrow -Korean Fried Chicken -Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings  My eyes are typically bigger than my stomach and I like to go hardcore and get 5 or 6 sharable plates, but we thought it through and held back and went with 4.  I am very glad we did because I could barely finish those four my stomach was so full.  Very plentiful shareable plates.  The Tuna Poke Tacos usually come with only 3 tacos and they are about the size of your palm.  We opted to spend a couple of extra bucks so we could get a fourth taco.  The main reason we were won over by B&E was that they served bone marrow.  It was my favorite part of our meal! If I ever go back to Vegas it would be tough to not give this place a try again.",

We waited out the 25-minute wait for our dinner reservation by ordering drinks named Pink Panther & Beauty Elixir at the bar & enjoying them in the gorgeous lounge area.   My group of five ordered a lot:  -- Thai-style deep fried shrimp: my absolute favorite of the night! Next time I'll get an order of five just for myself! My other faves include: crispy vidalia onion rings, chile relleno arepas, & the adorable spoonfuls of grilled cheese & tomato soup dumplings.  -- the seafood dishes, shrimp cocktail & lobster roll, were good, but not great. -- pulled chicken arepas & short rib mac & cheese sounded delicious, but didn't meet my expectations.  -- By the time the 10 oz. filet & 14 oz. ribeye arrived, we were too stuffed to really enjoy them; next time we'll request that they be served somewhere in between the many smaller courses.  -- did not try: garganelli, pressed jerk spiced chicken, tuna, & braised chicken meatballs.  -- desserts: petite cupcakes, devil's food layer cake (super delicious), & butterscotch pot de creme   I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Chris Santos the night we went & he was so sweet & charming!! I'll have to give B&E in New York a second chance (in hopes of running into him there!) ;)",

    "text": "You know, I had such high expectations of this place because I absolutely love every restaurant I've ever been to at the Cosmo, but this one... did not meet my expectation at all. First off, they changed their menu, so a lot of their delicious mouthwatering pictures you see, are probably gone.  For our group, we shared the tuna tacos, pork chop, avocado toast, Mexican corn ravioli, yellowtail carpaccio, salmon, chicken and ktown bao buns. Out of all of them, I can honestly say the only one that was worth it was the bao buns, at 8 dollars a piece. They had a very good flavor and it all balanced very well. The ravioli was extremely bland, and I loveeeee Mexican corn. I just don't think it tasted good as a pasta dish AT ALL. The avocado toast was decent. The yellowtail carpaccio and tuna tacos were good, but honestly, I'd rather go to Zuma or Morimoto. The salmon was cooked very well. But I didn't like what it came with, which was couscous and mashed potatoes. It took away from what could've been a great salmon bc those two are practically flavorless. I stole the lemon from the pork chops to season the salmon pieces. The pork chop had good flavor, and the meat wasn't tough at all but I wouldn't choose it. The chicken was the same thing.   And to top it all off, nothing was done for the birthday celebrant, after telling the hostess upon making the reservation. Which only shows how -great- the service is.   All in all, we didn't even spend that much, but everything we got was not worth it at all. Now I can regretfully scratch it off my must try restaurants in Vegas.",

Even before the restaurant got full, I could barely make out what the wait staff was saying, to the point of having to ask them to repeat themselves.   The service was excellent. We were waited on by a couple of staff members and both were very knowledgeable about the menu as well as attentive and polite overall.   We tried the salmon ceviche, the arepas, the macaroni and cheese, and the mushroom pizzette. The mushroom pizzette was our overall favorite, followed by a tie for second place between the arepas and the macaroni. The arepas tasted like a small bite of a genuine arepa, with a nice twist of the jalapeno. The ceviche didn't impress, with the flavor being bland overall.   For dessert we had the donuts and the peanut butter pie sundae. Both were good, with the donuts having slightly too much sugar. We had to dust them off a bit before eating each one.   Overall it was a good dinner but for the price I would expect a slightly better overall experience. The acoustics really were my biggest complaint.",

But the Mac and cheese dumping with bacon was also good. There really wasn't a bad dish, and we tried around 10 of them. Even the desserts.  I wasn't in a cocktail mood so I had a bourbon and a few beers. Crazy hectic bar service as it was open bar, so hard to judge what the vibe will be like on a normal night.

We ordered so much food that I don't remember all of them but nothing disappointed.   If you like quiet restaurants and have individual courses for each person then I'd say avoid this place since it's the opposite to all of that. I'm not saying it's noisy (well it sorta is) but it's more of a lounge with great food so you have music in the background whilst being surrounded by beautiful people enthusiastically communicating with each other.  It's a five star not only because the foods good but the overall experience was spot on. If you spend enough they might even let you enter Marquee for free, just ask your server.",

Our group of 4 ordered perhaps 8 to 10 small plates. We loved the chicken meatballs!  The tandoori chicken was also fabulous. His is not the place for a quiet romantic dinner (at least not in the front rooms) but for small groups it is an excellent choice.",

I feel like we ordered one of everything. My top of the list favorites are the tomato soup/grilled cheese bite. It is served on one if those Asian white soup spoons and it perfect. My second favorite were the meatballs. They were spiced perfectly and the sauce was awesome. Very creamy and delicious.  My boss likes his red meat medium well so when we ordered the filet I was worried it might be overcooked for me. However despite the temperature and no red at all it was incredibly tender. Very impressive. The kale salad is also very impressive. I eat kale solely because it is good for me, but personally I don't really like it. However with the salad I actually Alex for seconds. The garden salad was also good. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Our server went out if her way to work with the tables food allergies. She was extremely knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable knowing that she was making an eye on everything. I sure this place is going to do very well.",

We called ahead to see about reservations and they were booked, so they advised us to walk in.   Well, we walked in and were immediately seated. So that was pretty nice.   Our waitress, Jessica, was the nicest and really personable. She gave us great recommendations. We ordered our drinks: The Woodsman (mine) and Bubbles & Berries (my wife). Both drinks were so damn good.   As far as food goes, we got the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings to start. Small portion but packed with flavor. We split the burger (which came with their BBQ fries) and grabbed a side of onion rings.   The burger was melt in your mouth good. The onion rings were some of the best I've had. The BBQ fries were great too.   Despite being full, I ordered the \"les, nyc\" doughnuts. 6 mini doughnuts that come with chocolate, caramel and raspberry dipping sauces. It was pretty much game over after we finished those off and a food coma was incoming.   Highly recommended. The food and ambiance is awesome and those drinks of theirs are fire.",

Yes I am gluten free and lactose intolerant, so the waitress if it's a good one should ask any restrictions before suggesting five menu items with dairy and meat. Wasn't even listening.  The drinks were mediocre at best. I got an aperol spritz that wasn't very sparkly and watered down.  I enjoyed the apps but when it came to the rest of the meal, Including this dish the waitress highly recommended I wasn't appeased. I was actually hungry after too, and got a treat at another hotel.   The ambiance is good service wasn't at all bad but I wouldn't come back for the price tag and quality of the food provided. I was hoping for more From this location inside the cosmo.",

    "text": "This place is consistently good. Much better than their sister location in LA which tweaks the recipes negatively like put mushrooms inside the chicken meatballs even though they're served in a mushroom sauce then serves it with truffle goat ricotta. Vegas does it right not overpowering the dish by over doing the mushrooms. Their grill cheese tomato bisque bites are insane, their steaks are amazing, their chicken, Mac and cheese, I could go on all day. Everything on the menu is amazing including their desserts. If you can afford the calories I would recommend you at a minimum try the pot du creme and the donuts both but all of them are over the top. Service is very efficient and with a smile. Although not my server but the one on the 1st table when you walk into the dining room was ranting super loud for what seemed like forever about her personal problem, including laparoscopic hysterectomies, cancerous cells and all sorts of sad things which took my appetite away. I know the couple trying to enjoy a hot date didn't know how to ask her to please leave them to enjoy their date. I was subjected to it as we were the next table over but I didn't want to be unkind and ask her to stop or complain to management. However, it's clear this woman is going through a lot which is sad and makes me feel bad for her but her boss should really tell her it is unprofessional to unload on their customers that go there to have a good time and get away from their own problems. My two cents.",

We decided to try it out and made reservations on opentable. We were seated at the end of a long booth right next to the register which was awkward since there was always a waiter or waitress there doing something and hovering over us. For the appetizers we ordered the ahi tacos (very good but tinnnnnny), Brussels sprouts ( not great), and we ordered two drinks ...neither of us enjoyed it. My glass was full at the end of our dinner and the waitress didn't care to ask if we wanted to try something else. My fiance ordered the steak and I had the corn scallops which were great. Most likely will not be coming back just because the service wasn't great. Maybe we'll give the new LA location a shot. We'll see ...",

If you are looking to have dinner in Las Vegas with a semi night club atmosphere, meaning music, cocktails and a scene then you have found the right spot. The menu is great with a really good variety of food to choose from. Some of my favorite appetizers from the raw bar are the ORANGE KISSED SALMON CEVICHE jalapeno, mango, crispy corn tortilla, the TUNA POKE WONTON TACOS micro cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie and the YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI with pickled jalapeno, barrel-aged fuji apple ponzu. The jewels on toast options are good my two favorite are the STEAK TOAST with  malaysian spices, garlic, pickled radish, serrano pepper and CAESAR TOAST with  creamy garlic, crispy chicken skin. You should also try the SHORT RIB 'MAC & CHEESE' with pickled jalapeno, herb cornbread crust from the accessory section of the menu. My favorite Main Course choices are The BASIL PESTO RAVIOLI with  rock shrimp and tomato fondue. The STREET THAI BBQ CHICKEN with lemongrass parsnip puree, pickled carrot and mango. The GRILLED ATLANTIC SALMON with sherry vinegar, pearl couscous, red chard & celery root puree and lastly the ELOTE STYLE SCALLOPS with charred corn salad, chipotle, lime and cilantro.  I'm not into lobster tail but if you are then you might want to try the ROASTED LOBSTER TAIL with spanish chorizo arancini and saffron it's a favorite among my friends. The dessert is unbelievable, especially the Strawberry Shortcake Bars which has Liquid Cheesecake inside with a White Chocolate and Cap'n Crunch shell. Simply amazing! If you have a sweet tooth you must try them.! My other favorite desserts are the Spiked Root Beer Float Shot, Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme and lastly the Cloud 9 S'mores. You can't go wrong with any that you choose. OK time to go I hope this helps Ciao.",

My husband and I started with the Ceasar Toast with crispy chicken skin. The dressing was a bit overwhelming and it was missing the crunch of the skin I was hoping for.  We shared the empanadas, which were good, but tasted mostly of jalapeno and melty cheese; no complaints, but not exactly special and were only four small pieces. We ended the savory portion of the meal with the chicken meatballs (three to an order). Again, they were just fine...not something I would suggest or eat again.  My husband read that the donuts with dipping sauces were supposed to be good, so we ended the meal with those. The portion was pretty good for the price (a pleasant surprise!) and the dipping sauces were rich in their respective flavors. The donuts were oversized donut holes coated in cinnamon sugar. I had no issues with them but again, I'm unsure as to why they came so highly recommended.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. As other reviewers have said, it was very loud. I expected to be wow-ed, or to at least be more full, upon leaving, but I left wishing we had chosen somewhere else to dine.",

You walk in through a pawn shop and enter a large door to gain access to the restaurant. Inside is a dimly lit area with fun lighting, pictures and decorations everywhere. The hostesses and wait staff are also very kind and quick to help. Each waitress or waiter we've experienced has shown a vast amount of knowledge regarding the menu and is quick to offer recommendations based off of describing your likes. As a vegetarian, there are several items I enjoy including the mushroom pizzetta and cauliflower. My boyfriend (meat eater) enjoys the wonton tacos. The cocktail list is also phenomenal at this place. If you're a fan of tea try \"Earl the Pearl.\" I would go to this restaurant just for this drink! Pricing is also very reasonable.

This place gives you a measly five dollar shot. Horrible service and then when I complained about it they made me feel horrible and didn't care. Less than mediocre and I would not recommend this place for a girls night out or a dinner. Not worth the money and the ambience isn't that great for them to act like it's a Five star!",

Honestly, I don't think I would have ever even looked at this place or considered coming here because the name and the pricing of the food, but again since it was comped.. why not?  This place was like a hidden restaurant. You walk into a shop, not expecting the open a door and here is this fancy shmancy restaurant! I wish I had pictures to show! It is a very dark restuarant, the table settings and decor were nice! The service was great! Food came super fast! They offered us a three course meal, one shot and one mixed drink! Everything was SOOO worth it. The portions were small for the comped meals, I am not sure if they are normally that small for regular entrees/appetizers, but I still recommended coming here because it was so mouth watering. I am so glad that I was talked into trying this restaurant, FOR FREE. We will definitely come here again, whenever we hit up Vegas again!",

I'd head so many wonderful things about the food but was a bit wary about the noise. The restaurant was not busy at 7pm during a weekday. The night began very awkwardly when the host placed me in the absolutely worst table in the entire restaurant in the highest traffic area. Are u kidding me!!! I immediately asked to be reseated. They reluctantly obliged. I frankly don't care if you're trying to \"spread out\" the diners. Everyone else seated ahead of me seemed to seated just perfectly. The food was just ok but beware that there are bad seating options that they try to fill regardless of how busy the restaurant is. Bad form, really bad form.",

We all ordered main dishes and tapas.  The scallops apparently comes with 3 nugget sized scallops and when 1 order of the salmon came out, it looked as though they forgot half of it. Our food was EXTREMELY salty. I originally got my food first and after one bite, I sent it back for a new order. Once everyone else took a bite of their own food, they said the same thing. TOO salty! We were already there for too long. We got up, paid for our drinks and tip and left starving. Very unfortunate experience given I have heard great things about this place. I've been to the NYC location and loved it. Maybe it was a one off night, but we were very disappointed. Our server was very sweet and so was the manager, but I would have thought an invite back would have been nice.   It seems as though all the reviews from my weekend in Vegas were just as bad. :(",

    "text": "I am seriously disappointed with this place after the hype is has received in this city.  I am local and work in the food and beverage industry and usually give new restaurants a fair chance on the strip even though they are pricey.  For starters it took almost 20 min to get water.  I received my cocktail before anyone ever got their water glass filled at the table.  I couldn't even drink the cocktail.  I think it was called Beauty Elix.  I'm not sure what they did to it but it was watered down and and had no taste.  The prosecco it was topped with was flat.  Everyone at my table tried it and agreed there was no hope for it.  We sent it back and the server was very nice about it but didnt seemed the least bit surprised we stated it didn't taste right.  The next cocktail I ordered was called the Woodsman it has Woodford reserve, all spice dram, maple syrup and pears.  I expected this cocktail to be amazing but it again tasted watered down and had ALOT of ice in it.  I felt it was shaken instead of being stirred like it was probably intended to be.  It had potential but should have had more complexity to it for the ingredients it stated to have.  The server Holly seemed sweet but she was not that knowledgeable when we asked for recommendations and also forgot to put some of our food in.  She tried to play it off as if we should have gotten it already but that didn't make her look that good either.  She seemed fairly flustered the entire night.  Our food came out slowly and we had to wait a little while between dishes.  Keep in mind I work in food and beverage  management, and our group was of all bartenders or food servers.  It not like we haven't all had off days.  There was no service recovery attempt and it seemed like a downward spiral at this point.  The Dessert we ordered was the S'mores dish.  It was VERY sweet and not quite what you would expect given the description.  Should have played it safe with the donuts.  They did put a candle in it and sing happy birthday as we were celebrating my best friend's birthday, which was a plus!  The food here was good, but the portions were so small.  The server suggested the group of 4 I was apart of share 5 or 6 items.  That would have no way been enough.  We ordered way more and spent almost $100 each on tiny shared plates and a few mediocre cocktails.  After the wait for the water, returned cocktail and forgotten food items you would have thought a manager would make an attempt to touch the table to get a feeling of the situation but that was most certainly not the case.  I would normally go back to give another chance but after all that I'm not sure I want to spend my money there again.  Highlight was the decor and ambiance despite the very loud music.  The entry through a small shop and the hidden feel are definitely intriguing.",

The restaurant is very trendy and a great place to people watch.  It is pretty dressy for Vegas standards so prepare accordingly.

Not only was the music loud, but the place was FULL of bachelorette and girls trip large groups who accounted for a significant amount of the noise. If we were able to do without that, maybe it's a whole different experience, but I was ready to leave as soon as we sat down.",

    "text": "I have been to the NYC outpost, but it has been a few years at this point. Things have changed a bit. The menu is definitely smaller and they have taken of some of their best options. Tomato soup dumplings anyone? The Vegas location has updated the look of the restaurant, which the NYC location was needing when I went so I can only imagine how the old boudoir look is aging. Both locations have kept with the pawn shop speak easy entrance (you can actually buy things in the shop), which is cool. It's clearly their signature.  When my party arrived, I gave our name for the reservation and was met with a very snarky, \"I don't see that name just go to the bar.\" It was rude and unnecessary, and um....we made a reservation I'm not just going to go to the bar. The place was packed and she was clearly overwhelmed but she truly did not need to be so rude. Luckily someone else stepped in and helped us and we were seated. I will say, for the rest fo the evening, we were treated to absolutely excellent service from our server.   We were a very large party so we decided to go with a pre fixe menu and appetizers, entrees, and desserts were ordered for us from one person in our group. I am a vegetarian so there were a few options for me and a few for everyone else. here was also a vegan in the group and they were incredibly accommodating with how items were cooked and prepared to make sure we were satisfied. The food was pretty good, but not as good as I remembered it being in the NYC location. Overall, it was fine but I wasn't really that impressed. I did hear that the tuna tartare tacos were quite delicious. We weren't wowed, but it was good.",

I thin the stuff on it just didn't vibe well with the dish. Our server actually suggested that we get an extra scallop, since there's only 3. I didn't realize they were giant scallops, so we kind of regretted getting the extra scallop, especially since the dish was not that great.  The mexican street corn ravioli was really good though. I'd suggest getting that item if you come here. Service was so so. They would take away our plates  and utensils and not give us  new ones until bringing out the next dish and realizing we had no plates or utensils.  Also, seemed like the servers were dropping stuff as well. I heard dishes break a few times.",

    "text": "What a fun place to dine with your girlfriends! Walking up, the outside looks like a bar. They have a small lounge area where you can get free champs. Go inside, it looks like a jewelry pawn shop. Turn right and go further inside, and you enter the dark and sexy restaurant.   We were almost an hour late for our reservation on a Saturday night, but the restaurant was super understanding and accommodating. We only had to wait about 5 minutes before they took us to our round table for my 5 girlfriends and me.   We all weren't suuuuuper hungry, but the dishes are all small and pretty much like mini portions, so we ordered a bunch of things. The waiter made sure that our dishes came with 6 portions so each of us could have some, which was nice  Maine lobster roll- OMG so good. The bread reminded us of the breadsticks from Olive Garden, but in a good way. The lobster was buttery and melted in my mouth  French onion soup dumplings- We didn't know what to expect, but we knew we had to order them based off other reviews. They come in an escargot-like dish, with the dumplings in its own little round section and the whole thing is covered in melted cheese. Biting into the dumpling, the taste of french onion soup just oozes out and fills your mouth.   Grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings- These were just ok, in my opinion. Made for an interesting bite  Short rib mac & cheese- I like my mac & cheese to be creamy, and this one wasn't super creamy but the sauce was flavorful. The added shredded short rib was a nice touch   Roasted brussel sprouts- These were just ok too. Tasted like typical brussel sprouts, not anything particularly special about them  We had some good, attentive service, and we found all the food to be good. Our favorites were the lobster rolls and french onion soup dumplings though! We also learned that there's a location in Hollywood, so my friend and I really want to try it!",

My boss had recommended Beauty & Essex to me the day before I left for my trip and after doing some research I wanted to give it a try.   My mom and I were staying at the Cosmopolitan and she had played a lot there during our stay. It was our last night and she went down to the identity club to see if she had another free buffet on her card and it just so happens she did. We were going to go to the wicked spoon until we found out it closed at 9. The girl at the identity club was nice enough to call a host to see if he could get my mom comps for a restaurant. The host was nice enough to give my mom $100 in comps so we decided to go to Beauty & Essex. The girl at the identity desk made a call up to B&E to see if they could take us and to let them know that my mom had $100 in comps.   We were seated right away and I immediately started taking all the scenery in. It's pretty dark and really gives off a more intimate dining experience. Some people were dressed fancy and others were dressed pretty casual so it goes both ways. A lot of other yelpers expressed how loud it was, but honestly I can't remember it being loud when we were there.   We decided to order the asian chicken and dumplings and grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings to start. Hands down my favorite thing about the meal were these two dishes. These two dishes were the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1. For my entree I ordered the herb crusted chicken. It was just meh. It was a little on the salty side.   The service is what ruined this experience and it continued to go downhill as the night went on. We had multiple different servers coming to our table which was extremely confusing. One would say they were going to do something and then never do it. So we would have to ask the next person that came to our table.   The person that brought us our check was the first server that took our drink orders and he definitely had an attitude. My mom gave him the players card and told him there were comps on it and she would pay whatever the balance was. He came back saying he didn't see anything basically saying we can charge this to your room and deal with it later. Well my mom wasn't taking no for an answer so he got a manager involved. The same thing happened with the manager saying he wasn't able to see any comps. Both were not too nice about the situation which then pissed me off. 20 minutes goes by with people running around trying to figure it out. The hostess also tried to act like she had no idea about the comps when she was the person that talked to the girl down at the identity desk. He then comes over and said he had another manager look into it and its being taken care of. Not once did anyone come over to our table to apologize for the mix up. It wasn't until we were walking out the door the second manager apologized saying that he was new and it wouldn't happen again. There are a lot of things that won't happen again for me and that is coming back to this shady restaurant.",

It's got a darker atmosphere inside, but our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable about everything on the menu - so it made the entire experience that much more enjoyable. We decided to try as much as we could so we decided to go small plates style and share some of the dishes that we had seen pictures of or looked most delicious from the menu. My favorites would be: grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings (uniquest dish I have ever had and the dumplings melted in your mouth), the croque monsieur macaroni and cheese (breadcrumbs to make it crunchy and a delicious mix of al dente noodles and creamy cheese), and the chicken meatballs (so tender in texture and mixed with a mushroom cream sauce and ricotta). I would order all three of those a second time! We also had the tuna tacos which had a crunchy wonton as a shell and the empanadas which were good, but not as special as the other dishes. Our waiter also made sure to tell us how many items came in each order since there were two of us - those little things go a long way to make the experience a five star one!",

The drinks were amazing, the food was perfect and delicious. We then found out they were going to open a location in LA, we were ecstatic and talked about having our wedding reception there.

    "text": "So ... it's really hard to go from the NYC location to this one... NYC is so much better in ambiance, layout , and food/drink in my opinion.  I would rate this place between 3-4 stars so my 4 stars is being generous.  This location is located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The entrance is like NYC's - you enter thru a pawn shop( actually the pawn shop was nicer than NYC) .  There is a bar near the entrance then several dining rooms. It's very dark- too dark in my opinion. Ambiance is very loud and a lot of chit chatter. Eh.  Our waitress was very nice and efficient.   Drinks-- eh- nothing that me nor my friends loved. I got the Beauty Elixir and it just didn't seem as good here.  One friend had the bubbles  and berries. Forgot what my one friend had.   Food- its family style. You get several dishes and share which I think is fun and you get to try different things.   Oven braised Chicken meatball was ok. Thai fried style deep fried shrimp was ok. Pulled chicken arepas ok.   Short rib mac and cheese yummy Yellowtail sashimi yummy  Ended it with dessert ... L.E.S. donuts ( lower east side is location of the NYC location) . Yummy warm donuts with 3 sauces to dip- chocolate, caramel and a berry.   There's a photo booth there that's fun to pose with friends and you can email it to yourself.   I recommend reservations on weekends or special holidays etc",

    "text": "Jenny was are awesome server!   This place was just awesome!! We went all out and ordered a lot of dishes which you should too be expecting to pay $200+ for a couple to eat and drink. For everything posted (we had 4 drinks total) plus all the food you see, our bill was $277.   Dishes are well thought out and good portions. Not sure what the theme of the menu though.   The must have - bone marrow toast. Omg it's like butter!!!   Their oysters had a unique condiment, instead of the vinegar onion concoction they normally serve with oysters, they serve an onion/vinegar shaved ice.   This is an awesome place for a date night, with it's slightly hidden entrance, fun vintage shop, and live DJ in the restaurant.   If you read this far, my only qualm was the hostesses were far from hospitable. I am in the service industry, and it is so aggrevating to have to initiate the interaction. I said \"hello how's it going?!\" To the hostess and she said \"good\".... and just looked at me instead of asking me if she could help me with something. I had to tell her why i was in her restaurant after a 5 second silent pause. Like hello, I'm here because I have a reservation and want to dine in your establishment.... they need some work :)",

    "text": "If you are looking for a sophisticated and unique restaurant Beauty and Essex is the place to go. Their concept is family style tapas with a large diverse selection of items. This restaurant also has a high end pawn shop with very unique items for sale.    One of my favorite dishes is the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The dish is small but this small bite is full of flavor. The grilled cheese just melts in your mouth. Also you cannot go wrong with any of the sushi items as they are so fresh and flavorful. For dessert the best thing to order is the platter, this way you can try some of their best signature sweets.   However, I have not told you the best part. If you are a girl you can get some free champagne at the entrance of the restaurant.   Chef Chris Santos also does this at his NY restaurant but in that location they do it at the girls restrooms. Overall a great restaurant to try!",

And did I mention FREE champagne !  Upon entering it's a pawn shop then entering the doors is the dark lit restaurant. It is kind of hard to see and the music is loud but the food makes up for that. I've been here many times and tried a bunch of their food, and it's always a hit. Recommend their avocado toast, ahi poke tacos, meatballs, bbq fries, broccoli, and more I can't even remember.  I also tried their expresso shots(not sure what it's called) and it came in a really cool carrier. I also tried their lemon shots, super yummy.  Highly recommend ! And a great place to go to if you're visiting Las Vegas and it's right by Marque night club. This place is pretty fancy and people usually go to the club after so dressy/fancy attire is what most people wear.",

Hidden inside of an actual high-end pawn shop that sells memorabilia and jewelry, you'll find a gorgeous restaurant with food made for kings and queens.  From the moment we arrived we were greeted with perfect hospitality. The service here is really great they made sure our every need was met. The decor is beautiful and the vibe is edgy yet reserved. Many people comment on the volume of the music but we did not think it was loud at all (many of those are probably used to dead quiet dining).   The menu is very diverse and provides options that anyone could enjoy. You have to try the Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Dumplings, one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  For our entree we went with the 12 oz filet. This steak was melt in your mouth perfect! Served with a whole head of oven roasted garlic, truffle hollandaise, and truffle au jus. This steak was in my top 3 pieces of meat ever eaten.  If you are visiting Las Vegas, this is a wonderful fine dining experience. You will be very pleased with your visit.",

We also tried the scallops (meh), Thai style fried shrimp (yum), Mexican Street corn ravioli (yum), chicken meatballs (yum), and the carrot cake (bomb).   I'd say the tomato soup grilled cheeses and carrot cake are a must order.   We also had Hennessy side car cocktails that were great as well!

Just be wary of its Hollister-store lighting (it's dark) and double-check your bill, our server accidentally added an extra dessert to our check.  The GOOD: Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos, Chile Relleno Empanadas, Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp, Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings, Blistered Shishito Peppers, and BBQ Fries.   All of these choices were the group favorites of the night. If you're limited in options get the poke tacos and grilled cheese dumplings, you won't regret it.  The MISSES: Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs, Croque Madame Mac & Cheese, and Korean Fried Chicken. The meatballs and Korean fried chicken were very very dry even with limited sauce to complement. The mac & cheese simply had no flavor even with the egg on top. Save your money with these options.  In the mood for dessert? We got the 'The Dude' Shake Shot, Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme, Tiramisu Sundae, and 'Carnival' Peanut Butter-Pretzel Sundae. All choices were yummy. I highly recommend the peanut butter sundae, especially.  Good times and good hangs. Happy with my experience with this location.",

We choose 4 items + 2 \"sides\" 1) Grilled Cheese Dumpling in tomato soup ***** 2) Mexican Street Corn Ravioli ***** 3) Fried Shrimp**** 4) Korean Chicken*****  You MUST order the grilled cheese dumplings!!!!Just do it. If you don't love them, I'll reimburse you! Haha (jk) but you will love them!    The Mexican street corn was just as jaw dropping delicious!   Side 1) Onion Rings: Jumbo rings.  Nothing unique about them, but dang a they were delicious! Side 2) BBQ Fries: this is the one item that wasn't good.  They were just heavily seasoned fries.  Nothing special.   Crystal was FANTASTIC! Bubbly fun personality yet extremely professional.  One of the best servers I've ever had anywhere.  She offered recommendations for cocktails and food and they were all spot on!   We will definitely return to Beauty and Essex!!",

It is literally next door to some of the top restaurants on the Strip and I was so glad we went here.  Each and every appetizer was LIGHTS OUT good. Totally amazing, insanely flavorful, perfectly cooked. I mean PERFECTLY.  This place has ruined scallops for me because I don't think I'll ever get them that unctuous and delightful anywhere else.  I particularly enjoyed the pork bun and the grilled cheese / tomato soup bite as well.   You really can't go wrong here! Shout out too to their delicious drink, The Pink Panther. I'd been dying to try something with The Botanist gin in it for a while and this featured it oh so nicely, and was lovely with the pink peppercorn liqueur. It was a nice way to get some liquor with your meal and have it not be as dominant as a Scotch or as fruity as other pink drinks can be :)  5 stars!  My only complaint is that the music is so loud here I may need hearing aids. In all seriousness, though, your voice may be hoarse the next day from trying to speak clearly to your friends!",

The smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings are my current obsession and I'm contemplating a second flight out just to indulge in more.   We also sampled the salmon ceviche, Mexican street corn ravioli, octo-tacos (just renamed because man that's fun to say), and onion rings. The ceviche was probably our second favorite as it had very good flavor and texture. I wish the street ravioli had something else to it. Although it was good, I don't think we would order that again. The mustard and ketchup that came with the rings added just the customizable change-up that was needed. We also really enjoyed the octo-tacos!  All in all, we had amazing service and a beautiful restaurant with delicious food. It made for a wonderful anniversary dinner.",

    "text": "Overall, my best meal experience while in Vegas. I popped in for a quick drink and dinner and really enjoyed the ambiance. It's sophisticated but also way more chill than the vibes I got compared to basically everywhere else in The Cosmo.   Wine was great but no joke the Croque Monsieur mac & cheese was by far the best dish I've had, anywhere, in 2019. I'm already declaring this the dopest dish of '19. It's heavy and decadent - I recommend it as an appetizer or side to share with your table as I only had a few bites. I shared some with my new Brit buddy next to me at the bar. Then had a few bites of leftovers the following day and there was still plenty left. Delicious but meant to be shared!  Only negative of this place was the chick in charge of the \"pawn shop\" area when I left. I inquired about an item and the nice guy there gave me a quote when I first walked in. When I left, he was gone, and replaced with a cranky rude chick who tried to upsell me. I asked about the same item and she quoted me $30 more. Not sure what was up with that but it was really a bummer after having such an awesome experience otherwise.",

After you walk through that, it's got a cool contemporary hip vibe.  We FEASTED.  I have a love/hate relationship with tapas/small bites restaurants.  You keep eating and eating and then you get up feeling ridiculously full when you get up.  But even if you know this is the result, you still go crazy enjoying the shareable sized plates.  Kudos for them having a vegetarian menu for my one friend who lives that lifestyle.  The rest of us enjoyed the following: BBQ fries Yellowtail (2 orders) Tuna tacos (2 orders) Chicken meatballs Onion rings  Thai shrimp Korean chicken Butterscotch pot de creme Donut bites with dipping sauces Grilled cheese soup  Loved loved love the yellowtail. I could have eaten BOWLS of it.  Chicken meatballs and thai shrimp were just okay.  Tuna tacos and the Korean chicken were flavorful too. Both desserts were ridiculously good.  Drinks were also tasty. We got multiple rounds of the berries and bubbles! Would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "Wow, what a fun and yummy restaurant all balled into one. So don't get confused, there is a pawn shop/store before the main entrance of the restaurant- super cool and creative! Once you're in the restaurant it has such a cool \"speak- easy\" secret/backroom vibe; I love the ambiance!   Our server, Crystal was cool - she provided the right amount of attentive customer service.   The concept for the food is small - plates, sharing style. My gf and I ordered 5 dishes to share and we were more than enough full to the rim. The gentleman and his wife next to our table bought us the dessert Ferris Wheel which features a little of everything (peep my picture)!   For foods we tried the following items:   1) Roasted Bone Marrow - the meat was tasty which went well with the caramelized, sweet onion paste. The bread that came with it, was a little to crunchy for my tasting by the bone marrow's texture along with the crunchy bread made up for it.   2) Dumplings in Tomato Soup - was recommended by our server, Crystal. These are tasty with a nice after taste of the tomato soup. A change from the normal dumplings you'd get from China Town.   3) Salmon-Mango-Jalapeno- Ceviche : this was tasty, order it! All the different flavors make the one bite worth it! So fresh too!   4) Korean Fried Chicken: the sauce was slightly overpowering and the chicken was a little tough - I would pass on this next time. Not what I expected.   5) Poke Tacos: 3 come in one order, these were tasty with a sight hint of citrus. Order them!   I would highly recommend this spot not only for the ambiance but for the food. It's priced right, for all of our dishes we were right around $100 for two people.   I'd visit again in the future.",

Music was a bit too loud...we definitely had to yell to order and conversation across the table was impossible. Food was mostly good... Meatballs were recommended by the waitress and we could see why. The zucchini pasta was underwhelming. Everything else fell somewhere in between. Cocktails were quality.

I loved the Roasted chicken pozole -- which we didn't have the chance to take a photo of because it's hard to take photos in the dark and people will probably get annoyed if we continuously use the flash. I would also recommend the Mexican street corn ravioli and tuna poke wonton tacos. The grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings are basically bite sized grilled cheese dipped in tomato soup already but it was good.   Would definitely come back to try other items from the menu. ;)",

Came here for the 2nd time hoping it would be better but it was worse food wise. Had the chicken dumplings and they were disgusting. The broth was a thick soy sauce gone old taste - and the chicken was dry. The ingredients individually were gross and the combination was worse. Also ordered the empanadas and it tasted like cold fast food from a drive thru. What I don't like about the food menu here is that it's a bunch of food that doesn't go together - like going to an office potluck.  To get to the restaurant that's beauty and the beast feeling, you walk through a pawn shop which is very unique. I think it's worth it checking out for drinks, just wouldn't plan on a full dinner here.",

    "text": "Gah, I love this place!!!!!  It makes me so happy to come here.  Only thing I don't like about this place is that when you have a reservation, you still have to wait.... like up to 20-30 minutes... eye roll.  But it is worth it.   Quick overview on process:  Enter through the pawn shop.... it's a real pawn shop which is fun!  I always take a peek at the jewelry.  As for dinner, this is a shared plates place.  Even the steaks come precut so it's easy to share.  I'm not sure the minimum of bites they bring out per dish.  We ahd 10 people and for everything we ordered they brought the exact amount so each person got one bite.  I've been to this location twice now and the food does not disappoint.  Here's my rundown: Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - delicious. fresh. crunchy. perfect. Kale & Apple Salad - one of the best salads I've had.  Great dressing. The House Salad - this competes for sure with the above.  The crispy chickpeas make this salad for me. French Onion Soup Dumplings - They come in servings of 6.  Cheesy, salty, onion. soooo gooood!!!  MUST ORDER for me!!! Chile Relleno Empanadas - Creamy goodness in a pastry.  What's not to love?? Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings - Heaven on a spoon.  Easily orderable Vegetarian sans the Bacon.  I could eat like 20 of these!!!  Another MUST ORDER! Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta - did someone say truffle cream and caramelized onions?  This is my kind of pizza.  Flatbread style.  So good. Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings - I mean they are good... but nothing special here.  I would say pass.  Short Rib Mac and Cheese - also, for me, this was good but something you can get elsewhere.  If you are short on stomach space, I would pass on this guy.  Les NYC Doughnuts - the dessert go to.  Love the berry sauce.  Think beignets. Strawberry Shortcake Bars - Unique. Too sweet for me but tasty.   Other table favorites that I didn't try: Paprika Spiced Salmon, Elote Style Scallops, the Filet and Sirloin.  Service is friendly and fairly quick.  Great atmosphere.  Also be on the look out for flashers and photographers wandering around the restaurant.   Also, last time we were there, they had a DJ spinning some great throwbacks.  They ended up clearing out tables from the bar and a huge dance party started.  Great night!!!!  Lastly, be sure to check out the video postcard station near the bar.  Us girls had so much fun making these!!",

We also had the lamb chops that were perfect and the scallops with corn and i cannot recommend these enough. Our waitress was really good and we loved the atmosphere as well. We were in the back room and it is much quieter than the main dining room. One of our party had The Woodsman for his drink and we all really liked that. It is not too sweet and really complimented the meal.  The Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme  is oh so good and the smores dessert is not to be missed. I could not resist buying the cookbook on the way out to try and recreate some of these amazing dishes.  The pawn shop on the way in is really cool too!

So, don't be fooled by the (very cool) pawn shop entranceway. It's all part of the experience and only the first stop on your dining experience. If you're ever in Vegas, be sure to stop in. It's not the cheapest by any stretch of the imagination, but you won't be disappointed in the value.",

Our bartender was phenomenal.  She was so attentive and even took the time to ask us about our preferences to see if she can recommend something, which she did and it was delicious.  I loved this place and the jewelry outside in their \"pawn shop\" was really nice, added to the experience.  Will definitely come here again.",

I ordered the scallops and when they arrived, they smelled overly fishy, when I sent them back the waiter said that they where made with fish sauce..... sigh.... can you please warn me about fish sauce? It's a very strong and aquired taste. Apart from that, our service was below par our server seemed very annoyed and upset in general, saying we were \"cutting him off\"  and that he was \" just explaining the concept but if you want to do something else, then we are happy to accommodate\" funny part is, he didnt seem too happy about it. My husbands drink took about 20 minutes and for a group of 10 we were stuffed into a table for 6. Needless to say this wasn't underwhelming, it was downright disappointing.",

    "text": "I've never been here for dinner (although I have sampled some of the menu), so this review is for the lounge and bar area only. Cutting to the chase, this is one of my favorite lounges on the Strip and is *fully* deserving of five stars....with one annoying and easily-remedied exception.  This is a fantastic place to bring Vegas newbies, and always feels like a special experience.  Wind your way through the pawn shop, through the unmarked entrance door and past the hostess stand, then hang an immediate right into the lounge.  Yes, it's essentially just the holding zone for diners waiting for their tables to be ready, but it's a far cry from standing outside Applebee's waiting for your buzzer to go off.  The lounge is dark, moody, and dramatically draped with strings of pearls that all meet in the room's central chandelier.  The couches and chairs are upholstered in supple, purple leather, and textured walls with brass sconces complete the atmosphere.  Everyone is dressed to impress (as you should be), and the high turnover of gorgeous denizens ensures primo people watching.  The bartenders are fantastic, the drinks are imaginative, and the DJs are spinning 90s hip hop. Oh, and French onion soup dumplings.  What more could you ask for?  The subtracted star is due to confusion & inconsistency regarding Cosmopolitan's property-wide \"Unlock Your Mondays\" offer.  According to the Cosmo website, Beauty & Essex offers \"buy one cocktail, get one complimentary featured cocktail\" from 9-11pm every Monday.  When I visited in June, my group used this promo to order 2-for-1 signature cocktails, but when I visited in July, I was told that the promo only covers house cocktails...so for every sublime signature cocktail we ordered, we'd get, say, a complimentary old fashioned with soda in it. Ack.  It's a minor niggle, but annoying nonetheless.  Still, don't let the Monday Cocktail Crapshoot keep you away, because Beauty & Essex is still a very special place to spend an evening.",

Food was excellent, and it's nice to be able to try so many different small plates. Everything we tried was great. The ravioli, tuna tacos, steak toast, lamb bucatini, avocado toast, tomato soup dumplings and hamachi were favorites.  Wine list is fantastic with many great choices.  Service was excellent and very nice.   You walk through a pawn shop to get inside - I wish I'd had time to shop! Great jewelry and bags.   Definitely would return.",

At the advice of my fellow yelpers, we focused mainly on the \"must-haves\".  Grilled Cheese Dumpling and Tomato Soup: delicious but arrived more warm than hot. A bit odd but the flavors were on point.  Thai Shrimp: perfectly crispy, seasoned well. Papaya salad was meh at best. This one came out hotter temperature-wise.  Dry-aged beef slider: perfect size and very good! A great few bites!  Mexican street corn ravioli: again, delicious but a bit heavy on the cheese (for me).   Pork chop: this was the dish that was most meh for me but hubby enjoyed it.   All in all, a great first experience. Service was on point which is always a pleasant surprise! Great spot for groups also.",

We were a part of six and even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready for at least another 30 mins. They were so apologetic that they gave us a bottle of champagne on the house. And then loads of appetizers and also an entire (overly generous) dessert platter. There was a delay with my food and they comped it - we didn't even ask for any of it or weren't even very annoyed. We were enjoying ourselves.  My food was incredible. I had the lemon zucchini pasta and brussel sprouts. It just was such a lovely evening. Everyone at the table loved the food.. we weren't hurried or neglected even once.  I'd go there again just for the service!",

    "text": "A total mixed bag, but not one that I can recommend.  We had reservations for 7pm mid-week, and we needed them. The 'enter through the back of the pawn shop' gimmick is really neat. The room is gorgeous, and we were seated in a small curved sofa towards the back wall. Probably the best seat in the house.  Water came, ordered cocktails, sent one water glass back with a chip. 5 minutes later, cocktails come, ask for the water glass and get it. Yeah, small thing, but it was an sign of things to come.   Our waitress suggested 2-3 items per person, so we ordered 4 to start, and I asked her if I should order them two at a time so that we weren't rushed, and she assured us that she would take care of that.  So yeah, all four dishes came within a few minutes of each other. So rather than eat in the order in which we wanted, we had to eat based on what dish would taste best lukewarm.  On to the food. Considering the provenance of the chef, we found the dishes to range from decent to mediocre.  So yeah, 4 dishes was plenty, we ended up eating faster than we wanted, food was underwhelming, and our waitress had too many tables.   Bill came and it was the better part of $300 after tip. Considering the obvious defects, we could have done so much better. Too bad because the room & concept is outstanding.",

    "text": "Literally one of the most underwhelming meals I have had at any restaurant - ever. Service .5 - food - 1.5 - and that's only because there was an ice cream root beer shot for dessert .. lol. I mean .. from the start - I asked for a different table because we were squeezed into the corner and the hostess gave me the dirtiest look and said \"well what would you prefer then?\". Well what would I prefer then??? Wtf. I would prefer not being spoken to in a rude manner - by a 18 year old in heels, when we are trying to have a nice dinner at a semi pricey restaurant.   The female server didn't even tell us anything about the menu- \"are you ready to order\" well.. no - we've been sitting here for about 4 minutes. I was looking for some inspiration and suggestion perhaps ...but - nothing. I asked about wine, and was greeted with a blank stare. I resorted to asking our neighboring tables how their meals were and what they suggested. We chose a few things hoping to get something great - but none of it really hit home or worked that well. Just uninspired and basic dishes. I'm not just trying to be a jerk - but it was pretty weak, and the despondent service made it so much worse.   From that point on, we were repeatedly underwhelmed by the food and we were literally so hungry. Elote corn scallops? - Baja style fish tacos? - the most un flavorful Brussel sprouts ?? What is the direction of the menu meant to be? It was so all-over-the-place.   We didn't finish one single dish and it was cleared away without question. We just had a couple of martinis and hoped dessert would save the meal. It was helpful- the root beer floats - but didn't make up for how weak the rest of everything else was.   To make it worse - The server disappeared for nearly half an hour and eventually I had to get up and chase down a guy in a suit with an earpiece - just to get our check. Terrible. I know things happen - but c'mon. The place was packed and we could not get our check so we could just leave.   This was a fail to say the least. The room was cool and the decor was fun. The 90's inspired music track was a cool vibe - but the service was absolutely terrible and the food was so basic. Seriously.   No one will read this or care - and the kids that think this is good good will continue to support blandness because they have no idea what good is anymore. At around $100 a head - you would hope for, at least, very good. This was REALLY not  great.   Let's hope you have a better experience.  Happy Eating!",

The grilled cheese and tomato dumpling was amazing!   The Staff - The staff was attentive, maybe too attentive? We had four different servers either taking our order, bringing us food, and cashing us out. We always had one waiter standing within a couple feet of our table, it felt like we were being watched over. My husband and I felt very rushed once we were done with each meal. The second we are the last bite, the plate was taken and we were asked what else we wanted. I guess typically this would be nice but we felt rushed and pressured to get more then we wanted. Cashing out was extremely rushed and almost uncomfortable too. The waiter stood over us as we were pulling out our card to pay and as we were deciding how much to tip. We got two drinks and three shareable plates and we were only there for forty minutes. For the price we paid, we would have liked to sit and relax a little longer without being rushed off.  The Atmosphere - Was amazing! The place is beautiful and we love you have to walk through a pawn show to get there. It gives it a speak easy feel.",

    "text": "My whole experience at Beauty & Essex bounced back and forth from being exceptional to awful all throughout my meal.  The staff really tried hard to make up for the problems I experienced, but there's only so many times and so much they can do before you question things. I still greatly enjoyed my meal but it was filled with errors all night long.   We came at 10pm on a reservation but weren't seated until 10:45pm. Considering we had a reservation, that's fairly ridiculous. I do understand they can't seat us until a table is open, but don't offer me the reservation option in the first place then. It's an easy thing to honor.  We were offered a free drink ticket to compensate us for the wait, however, which was a nice touch.   The food and drinks were very good during the meal. To drink we had the woodsman (bourbon based, little too sweet), the electric avenue (strong, old fashioned type, very good), and the bubbles and berries (fruity, boozy, great). To eat we had the tomato tartare, sliders, fish tacos, and ratatouille. Here's where the biggest issue came - the pace of the meal. The only explanation I can think of is the kitchen forgot about us. The tartare came out fast enough. It was exceptional; it was one of the better dishes I've had in Vegas actually. It had a sundried tomato taste with a small runny egg on top. Our next dish, the fish taco, came out literally an hour later. The fries on top were exceptional while the actual taco was just fine. The sliders were quite nice and actually an ok deal at $8 each. The ratatouille came last, a little out of order if you ask me, but was very good. I wish it came out wth the sliders to make that a full meal but whatever.  The presentation of all the dishes was a nice touch.   Because we waited so long for our food we were again offered free drinks and dessert. The staff was really trying to make it up to us but at that point it was getting kind of funny that our meal just kept getting wrecked and fixed nonstop. So in the end we tried the donuts and root beer float. I would say the donuts in chocolate sauce were great but the float and the rest of the sauces were a pass. Very good coffee here as well.   So after a good meal and all the free drinks and dessert, the meal only cost $75. That's a ridiculous steal even after a 3 hour atypical food excursion. I would come back because I really think they were having an off night and they deserve another chance. They do try to make it up to you if they mess up so I appreciate that, but my advice is, as a customer, give yourself time, don't make plans right after the dinner, and expect a long meal.",

Once you get into the restaurant is where all the magic happens... they've got a very cool ambience and I would suggest dressing up a bit for the type of restaurant it is. The bar area is cool and the food is really good. Truth be told, if I could give it 4.5 Stars I would because some of the food is not 5 star food, but some of it really is (you HAVE to try the grilled cheese in tomato soup tapas). My wife and I have been here twice now and the first time it was VERY busy so I'm thankful we made reservations. The 2nd time was also a weekend night, so we made reservations for 7pm and, to be honest, I'm not sure that they were busy enough to warrant the reservation (better safe than sorry though!). Overall this place is really a must-try if not only to experience the entrance/ambiance and the really good tapas... I have a sneaky suspicion that the next time that my wife and I stay at the Cosmo, we will be dining for a third time here...",

    "text": "The famed NYC hotspot where the beautiful, A-list, jetset come to lounge and be seen has finally opened in Vegas and...  Thud.  I'll explain.  Enter a pawn shop, through the secret back door, and into a posh Victorian world bordering on museumesque with excess, with theatricality that Elizabeth Taylor would look at home.  Dark colors, glittering jewel boxes, mirrors, pearls.  LOUD music.  Posh, quirky, with swank star appeal.    But this is Vegas, step out of your limo without panties showing off your woohoo, no one would care.  Mega clubs, ultra lounges, world class food, the likes of Cirque du Soleil.  Hotspots and quirkiness abound.  Exclusivity?  Ha!  Anyone with a credit card is welcome.  Basically, it's NOT special enough and if not for its Cosmo location, it wouldn't make sense in the already over the top city.  The food is good but except for a few provocative gems, isn't special enough for the ambiance.  Gem 1:  Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumpling, the perfect bite size reinterpretation of the classic.  A crisp \"dumpling\" filled with a molten core of five different cheeses in a spoonful of rich, creamy tomato soup garnished by the smallest pinch of bacon and chives.  An incredibly pleasing nostalgic bite whose wow factor brings a smile.  Gem 2: French onion soup dumplings. Think XLB of heavily caramelized, beefy onion soup baked in an escargot dish topped with melted cheese, a crisp crouton atop each.  Be careful, the dumplings contents are HOT. Inventive and just fun to eat.  The remainder of the dishes sampled were correct but not over the top special.  Tomato tartare (tomato and quail egg atop a parmesan crisp - good salinity, acid, and creamy richness), Maine lobster roll (classic prep in old bay, mayo in a sweet potato roll - sweet lobster, well seasoned but just OK), lobster tacos (beer battered lobster topped with a red cabbage slaw and poblano crema - great flavor becoming cloying with fatty flavors but on first bite, great combination, the lobster remaining crisp with gentle chili heat).  Correct lounge service.  Meaning dishes come when they come, you're given what you need to eat, drinks are the priority, always delivered with a smile.  Price to experience; let's just say it's the poor man's Rose, Rabbit, Lie, delivering a somewhat cohesive, intriguing experience at literally a quarter of the cost.  Worth the visit?  I'll leave you hanging.",

    "text": "Wow! This place is so amazing! They seem to have a little speakeasy thing going on. Upfront it just looks like a fancy little pawn shop of sorts. When you enter in, walk towards the end of the jewelry case, there will be a swinging door for you to enter through.  Once inside, they ladies up front will greet you and get you where you need to go. Feel free to wait at the bar, it's beautiful! Great service, fantastic drinks. Full menu at the bar also.  In the restaurant they have an eclectic yet stunning decor. It makes you think about all the one of a kind pieces and who thought to put them all together.   The food? Amazing. It's tapas styles and our server said 4-6 plates for 2 people, we had 4 and they were all great. The house salad is good, but I wish they didn't put chickpeas fried, it's very light and refreshing and the chickpeas add a heavy oily taste :(. The shrimp cocktail has a great spice! And we also loved the bone marrow (they give you a lot!) and the Pizetta (mmmm truffle oil!)  And the service? great! The only thing is, just be ready to dish out some $$, remember, it is in the cosmo!",

    "text": "Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and it's such a cool place!  it is located behind a pawn shop.  you can even buy stuff at the pawn shop.  They open a door and lead you through a nice restaurant and to your table.  you would never guess how big of a restaurant is behind the pawn shop.  The service was impeccable.  I spilled my glass of wine and there were 3 people immediately on it, getting me a new plate, a new napkin and making sure it was cleaned up as soon as possible without notice.  When my boyfriend and 2 other guys we were with went to the bathroom, 2 servers came to our table and refolded their napkins nicely and placed it on their ends of their chair.  The restaurant is not really a speak easy, it was pretty loud actually. But I did like the atmosphere.   The food was delicious.  Everything we ordered.  It's portions to share so it was nice that we had 6 people in our party.  We each chose a dish and it was perfect amount of food.  We had some leftovers that we asked to box up.  they took it to the back and boxed it up for us, the only thing is, they forgot to give us our chicken packed up.  So we were missing one of our items.",

    "text": "No. Not impressed at all with the food quality. If you're coming here to eat, think again.   The empanadas were tiny and tasted like they came out of a cardboard box. Absolutely no flavor. Couldn't taste the poblano and the jalapeno cream was bland. For $14 this is unacceptable.   The arepas were a poor attempt at Colombian food. They are so small and they come out cold. Which to me seems like an \"easy\" way to get avoid actually spending time on creating this dish. Pretty sure the manchego cheese wasn't even on them and the jalapeno salsa was again, non existent.   I felt like I totally got ripped off considering how poorly put together these dishes were for the price that we paid. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the Mac and cheese was decent.   Overall, I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you want to visit a lounge with expensive drinks. I'll give them that- very nicely decorated and a cool concept- (behind a \"pawn shop\") But if you do come here save yourself some money and don't eat. Go somewhere else where you'll actually get good food.  Very disappointed.",

    "text": "Walked by B&E several times and never realized that it was actually a restaurant as it is hidden behind a pawn shop. I really liked the unique decor and setting of the restaurant and it was the perfect intimate place for our date night. We were instructed that the plates were meant to be shared and we should get 4-6 dishes for two people. At the end we thought the portions were actually pretty generous and three dishes were enough. We tried the beef tartar which we both really liked, the bone marrow which was tasty but there was almost no marrow at all so it was not really worth. We also tried the cauliflower dish. My wife liked this dish but I wasn't the biggest fan. I guess because i was expecting the Korean style red, hot and spicy cauliflower that we've had in a few other places before and this was not that. We also tried the layer cake with ice cream that we both liked. We couldn't finish it though as it was very generous portions. The staff were very nice and friendly and considering that it was nice restaurant in Vegas, we thought the prices were reasonable.  Food: 3.75/5 Service and atmosphere: 5/5 Prices: 4/5 Overall: 4/5",

Was sat at 9pm. As others have noted, the place is ridiculously LOUD.  The tables for 2 are close together, but the interior is beautiful. The bathroom is out in the casino :/  Grilled cheese dumplings were served in a set of 6 spoons over room temperature tomato soup. The mac and cheese came with a small amount of tender short rib.  Yes it was cheesy, but the dish lacked kicke. The Pearl of the Sea ($96) was served cold (waiter prepped us) and sure there were the staples- lobster, shrimp, oysters- but it lacked imagination.  Desserts were the best part as the donuts were served warm with 3 choices of sauce.  If you care about the food, pick another venue. If you want a fun time and some decent cocktails, this place is right up your alley.",

You walk up to Beauty & Essex and are greeted by a doorman/bouncer who lets you in, and it looks like you're in a pawn shop to be honest.  We walked thorugh what to me looked like a secret door, and then we are greeted by the hosts. They took us to our table and we got started deciding what dishes to get. The menu is like tapas, so we got a bunch of plates to share, and a few drinks too.  Honestly every dish was delicious. I don't have any complaints. My favorite dish was the steak tartar on toast.   This dining experience was what I expect from a Vegas restaurant. We were pampered and waited on by multiple waitstaff, and it just makes you feel great.

Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs - one bite and it was good but sorry the last remaining room in belly was for...  14 oz. Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin - Cooked the way it should be...medium rare, and was full of that beef flavor.  Overall great food, atmosphere and service...",

We had dinner reservations and got seated the minute we got there. The whole restaurant want was very awesome. You walk into a pawn shop and they have a few different spots in the restaurant. We sat in the main dinning area which had music playing through out our dinner with all old school songs. I truly loved that. Everything on the menu looked so delicious. Of course my boyfriend picks the best dishes on the menu with the short rib mac n cheese and my most favorite lamb chops.",

    "text": "My fiance and I dined here for first time a few nights ago. We have walked by here many times, but never realized what it was. From the outside it looks like a pawn store. It actually is the store where you can buy things but under Las Vegas strip law, you're not allowed to pawn anything. It has a collection of jewelry, purses, accessories, and interesting Notorious B.I.G. figures, (photographed below.) There is a security guard at the entrance who opens the door for you and a very pretty and welcoming girl working at the store. You enter the restaurant through the store. When you approach the restaurant there are many lovely hostesses waiting to seat you. My fiance and I showed up sans reservation and also starving. Luckily, they were able to take us right away. There is the middle dining area that is very busy and lively, and then there is the back room that is little bit darker and carries a different ambience. There is the front section where the bar is. We were walked to the back room. We had a lovely booth. Our server, Crystal approached us and asked if we wanted water. What we heard was \"sparkling or still?\". We order the still water. Come to find out later we would be charged eight dollars for this bottle. Make sure when you go there if you're not planning on spending money on water, you say specifically tapwater or make sure that they will not be charging you for it. Due to how crazy expensive everything is, we only got three dishes. We went with the tomato burrata toast, the tuna tartare tacos, and the wedge salad. She said for two people they recommend 4 to 6 dishes. I thought that was a lot when she said it, but once we got our dishes I understood why. Everything has incredibly small portions for how expensive it is. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and my fiance had the craft cocktail \"The Woodsman.\" It's their style on an old fashioned and it was delicious. Overall, the service was good, the ambience was definitely cool and unique, and the food was good. The prices seemed unreasonable to me. Otherwise it would've had five stars. There is also a Beauty & Essex in Hollywood down the street from where we live that I didn't know about. I definitely want to try that.",

Sad to say we were sorely disappointed. I shit you not, I have had a better steak at Chili's before and I fucking hate Chili's. Bf paid an exorbitant amount for 3 meatballs and over-seasoned mediocre fries. I got an awful over-seasoned (COVERED in black pepper), under cooked (ordered medium rare and got rare), tasteless, dry filet mignon steak. It came pre-cut so I assume the juices disappeared once the chef or server carved the meat before it got to our table.  Only redeeming dish were the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, but even that wasn't enough to make this more than a disappointing meal.  Total came up to $105, which is crazy for the quality (or lack of) we received. I was kind of expecting the bill to be discounted a bit because the manager came by to ask us what was wrong since we told our server the food was \"alright.\" Not coming back again. You'd make a better decision choosing ANY of the other Cosmo restaurants. Even secret pizza would've been better.",

There isn't really any directional signage and the front appears to be a retail store rather than a restaurant. I would recommend making reservations for sure. We came on a Sunday night and there were still a number of large groups and smaller, full tables. I loved the unique decor. What looked like empty wooden frames and window panes surround the dinning room along with vintage looking baubles. The restaurant menu is really designed tapas style which is, in recent years, my favorite way to dine. We tried a few different items including the chicken meatballs. They were very savory, tender but lean which isn't all that common for a meatball. We also had the sashimi which was very fresh and sliced into delicate thin slices. The only drawback we had was a very loud table behind us that kept dropping cutlery and and just generally being rowdy. However we received a free round of drinks, which may have been our servers way of making up for it. Or maybe he was just really nice. Either way I won't complain :). Check out their website to get a peek at the full menu and the decor. I would definitely recommend this place as a great date spot to get your evening started.",

Of course there's music playing, but every table is trying to talk over the next. I was sure I was going to have no voice the next day. I'm assuming it was loud because the tables are kind of clammed together in this closed in space.   Came on a girls comp (yes, yes... 6 girls can get a comp) for a birthday dinner before the night out. I'll have to say that my experience with comps, have been far better than this one.   We were served family style: ONE plate of yellow tail sashimi- which was by far the best dish we had!!! Full of flavor ONE plate of \"Cesar toast\"- which is basically a Caesar salad on toast.  TWO large plates of kale salad with pecans on the side (nut allergy) ONE pesto pasta dish (for 4 to share) and ONE non nut pasta for the two allergens to share.   That's it food wise. Of course it came with a drink and a shot each, but a meal of basically salad to hold us over. If we would've gotten TWO plates of each ( instead of just the salad) maybe it would've been a meal. This clearly wasn't enough for us as we ordered a plate of chicken meatballs to help hold us over, it was that or go to inn n out after! I don't want to be a girl complaining about a comp, but who wants to leave a restaurant hungry? The plates are extremely small as well. We also bought a desert for the birthday girl.   Service:  Our waitress is what keeps the stars at a good standing. She was informative and accrediting towards our nut allergy. Although, the timing on the shots miss the mark on what we requested (same time as desert), she was pleasant so kudos to her.   Nothing really makes me want to come back and spend my hard earned money here.",

I'd keep coming back for the braised chicken meatballs over their tasty truffle sauce. 3 large scrumptious meatballs for $19 totally satisfies my hunger!   Other menu items that are worth mentioning are the poke wonton tacos, yellowtail sashimi, avocado toast, grilled cheese smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings, broccolini, scallops with charred corn, and last but not least their strawberry shortcake bars!   This is definitely good spot to fill up on food and drinks before going to marquee.  Minus one star because it's ambiance and liveliness isn't as cool as their NYC location.",

The menu styles are the same, plates are Made to share and a few larger selections. The menus are completely different! The choices and offerings don't have anything in commons besides the BBQ fries.  We ordered the following.... Tuna tacos, kale salad, cod tacos, seared scallops, French onion soup, and broccoli.  Wow. Was everything amazing or what! It's impossible for me to pick which was the BEST because they all melt in your mouth.  The only dish we sent back was the broccoli, they were over salted and it was impossible to eat.  The French onion soup was so interesting. They are little bread balls with grilled onion soaked in French onion broth. When you bite in, you get the full effect of it.  I can't wait to come back and try more!",

    "text": "Ok let me start out by saying the first half of my experience was a 2 and then they somehow bumped up my experience to a 4 by the end of the night. I'de wanted to try this place in New York but didn't get a chance to so when I saw it opened in Vegas I asked my parents if we could try it. I called in to make a reservation and they were fully booked but told me that I could just come in and wait for a table. When we got there the girl at the front told us they had no available tables and no waiting list. My mother being the intimidating arab women she is somehow convinced them that they had to put us on the list and somehow we were put on it with only a 30 minute wait.   When we came back my mom was carrying friendly conversation with the hostess who was this pretty tall girl who was a complete b**** and was being so condescending to my mom and thank god my mom was tipsy cuz she didn't realize how rude the girl was being.   The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing, such a beautiful restaurant. Seriously every detail was so beautiful and unique. I liked the music but it was so loud we literally had to yell our order to the waitress.   We ordered the paprika spiced salmon, the yellow tail, the cauliflower, and the spaghettini.   So we waited almost an hour and then the waitress realized that she forgot to Put in our order. I don't understand how this happens but she had to retake our order and reenter it.   So after waiting even longer we get our food and all I can say is I was underwhelmed. My my parents liked the spaghatinni, I thought it was super average. The yellow tail was such a small portion, and the spiced paprika salmon was HORRIBLE. It was dry burnt and I couldn't even finish one piece. So at this point I probably would have rated the restaurant a one or 2 but they decided to bring us out some comped desserts and this was the redeeming factor.   They brought us the les Nyc dougnuts, the kygo cloud nine smores, and the strawberry cheesecake bars.   The kygo smores weren't great, I took like one bite  BUT THE LES DOUGHNUTS AND THE STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE WERE SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOD.  Seriously some of the best dessert I've ever had, especially the strawberry cheesecake bars. Omg so amazing. Thank God they brought those out because if it weren't for those and our reealllly nice bus boy, and the decorations, I would have never come back.",

Decadent flavor bomb. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - Magical. These were DAMN GOOD and very refreshing. Very crunchy too. Grilled Cheese Tomato Dumplings -Piping hot and flavorful, not the kind of soup dumplings you're used to. This is a pretty heavy dish and also heavy handed on the sodium, although tasty. Spaghettini - was my least favorite of the group, very average. It was super pesto-y and overwhelmed by parsley and lemon. Butterscotch Pot de Creme - OMG, so smooth, so good. Perfect amount of savory and sweet.  Service was phenomenal and the dishes were timed and tiered perfectly. I couldn't have asked for a better evening and this didn't even involved booze.",

Staff was well versed with the menu and good with recommendations.  Pricing - Acceptable however certain dishes can feel like they are overpriced when they are not matched with extraordinary tastes.  Little Neck Clams - Served on ice on the half shell. Presentation was just like what one would receive with Oysters however these were just small clams. I got what I asked for. Nothing special or beyond average. Chile Relleno Empanadas - Presentation was good. Taste was average. The Empanadas were a little too floury for my taste buds.  Chicken Meatballs - Thus dish was exactly as titled. Meatballs made out of chicken. Average dish.  Scallops - This is an awesome dish. Priced as such as well. Tasted delicious right down to the bed of corn the scallops were laid upon. This saved the day and the glass of wine.  Summary - This is a Tapas style restaurant. Small portions designed to order and taste several items in one sitting . I get that. However, when the restaurant is a Tapas style restaurant then it better hit a home run every single time on every single dish. This establishment fails to do so. We left Beauty & Essex feeling like we consumed several items of average appetizers.",

    "text": "First I want to say, EAT HERE!  This is the best dinner we had in Vegas.   Now, the negatives.  This is why it isn't 5 stars... - The beverage service was quite slow.  A guest should never be letting food get cold because they don't have their wine.  Yet this happened twice. - It's super loud.    Now, that said, the food is great and the food service is terrific.  Our waitress was well versed in the menu and able to guide us expertly.  And not what I'm used to in Las Vegas which usually comes down to 'my favorites are the kobe with foie gras and the lobster with truffles', i.e. the most expensive choices.  She guided us to some great options that looked fairly pedestrian on the menu.  To wit, the mushroom flat bread was sublime!  So we had that flatbread, the tomato carpaccio toast, the onion rings, and the chile releno empanadas.  The onion rings were really well made with dipping sauces that make you rethink ketchup and mustard - and as good as they were they were the least impressive of the dishes.  The carpaccio and the flat bread were inspired.  The former used a dried tomato to amp up the flavor.  The empanadas were a bit doughy on the corners, but the center was amazing.  Really really good food.  We had wine by the glass (as I wanted red and my husband white) and again the waitress guided us to really good options that weren't just the most expensive.  The venue is quirky, a speak-easy venue 'hidden' behind a pawn shop.  That's kind of fun.  The food though - well, eat here.  'nuff said",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is a spawn of the one from New York, a simple pawn shop on Essex street but hidden behind it is a bustling high end restaurant.  The same concept is brought over to Vegas and the Cosmopolitan is the perfect place for a concept like this. The entrance is a fully functional pawn shop and there's even a small lounge area with goods in glass cases out front where hostess take reservations as well. Upon mentioning your reservation or intent to walk-in you're lead through a door and on the other side of that door is what seems like another world. Very dark, modern interior as well as very loud ambiance. Mirrors adorn the walls and people dressed in high end fashion lounge by the bar waiting to be seated or sitting in for a drink. Upon checking in, you're quickly led down the rabbit hole into the main dining area which is like a modern day speakeasy inspired by Lewis Carroll novels.  Service: We've been here twice and we've had the same waitress. The place is loud but our waitress seemed to always be able to manage it quite well and never got any of our orders wrong. She wasn't pushy with drinks and would only ask once. Knowledgable with the menu and had a good idea of how much food to order to be satisfied. We always had an idea of what to get going in but her recommendations either reaffirmed it or provided perspective on new menu items.  Timing for food was good, water was always full, and waitress gave us our space when we needed it to eat and talk. Also props to them for not rushing guests out as they let everyone take their time and hang out as long as they want even when the place is bustling and there's a que in the lounge.   Dishes: The food here is meant to be shared family style therefore the portions are usually smaller. But unlike other places the portions here are exceptionally small for alot of dishes and high price point makes certain dishes hard to stomach.   Chile Rellano Empanadas: Comes in 4 and although good it isn't anything mind-blowing and definitely not worth the $14  Grilled Cheese/Smoked Bacon Dumplings: Comes in 6, fun to eat, and pretty tasty. This is one of Chef Santos' more popular dishes and fun to try out.   French Onion Soup Dumplings: Comes in 6, Very hot, pretty good as well with the melted cheese. Hot soup inside the dumplings provides a mini explosion of flavor and goodness.   Short Rib Mac n Cheese: One of the more bigger dishes, very hearty. Doesn't really stand out flavor wise as it felt like I was just eating basic pasta.   Beauty & Essex Burger: Best bang for buck dish right here as you get the burger and bbq fries. The burger is quite delicious as it's a mix of lamb and beef while everything else simply melts in your mouth. Bbq fries are also good and seasoned very well as it doesn't feel like they just sprinkled it on there.   Dry Aged Chuck Sliders: Sold by the piece, ended up getting this on the second visit to switch it up and it pretty good as well. The touch of jam gave it a sweet touch that was interesting.   Elote Style Scallops: 3 pieces on a bed of corn, The scallops were fresh and flavorful while the corn was charred just right.   Kygo Cloud Nine S'mores: A very fun dessert named and based off of Kygo's \"Cloud 9\" album with the similar blue streak. It was fun getting a dessert based off a popular DJ and the dish itself is quite good with plenty of s'mores and chocolate cake. Not overly rich but will still have you feeling a small sugar rush. Great dessert for two people to share.   Thoughts: This is one of those places that you go to say that you've gone there. The experience is fun and the overall presentation of everything is top notch. The food is good but leaves alot to be desired. This is very much a social restaurant where one goes to see and be seen. You'll be engaged in conversation while sipping on a crafted cocktail and picking at various dishes throughout the night. You won't leave smiling and thinking back to the delicious food but you'll leave smiling remembering the conversations, people, and little world tucked behind that pawn shop.",

    "text": "Talk about classy! This place made for a fantastic celebration dinner, after our party finished up the Rock 'N Roll Half Marathon. Couldn't have picked a better spot!  Our reservation was set for 10:45 pm, just 15 minutes before the kitchen was scheduled to close. The server was incredibly accommodating and we didn't feel rushed at all. Despite the lateness of the reservation, everything came out as desired and well-prepared.  We started things off with a series of cocktails. Mine was the Oaxacan Old Fashioned, which was a super tasty spinoff of a classic. The chocolate flavor was evident and the tequila/mezcal combo made for a surprisingly smooth sip.  Apps included the burrata toast and roasted bone marrow. We are obsessed with both burrata and bone marrow, and these flavored didn't disappoint. Only wish that some of the bones had a bit more marrow in them. Otherwise they were excellent!  I ordered the lamb, but snuck a few bites of the filet as well. I absolutely adored the lamb, and how well it paired with the polenta and accompanying sauce. The filet was also well prepared, both at medium and medium well (tried a bite of both!). It was actually surprising tender when prepared medium well, which usually isn't the case.  And of course, it's worth noting that the ambiance is a 10/10. The pawn shop in the front makes it feel like you've walked into the Vegas equivalent of a speakeasy. Love it!",

Lets be clear, this place is 100% one of my favorites in Vegas. That's why I am so critical.   First of all, I have zero complaints about food. Chris Santos had created a beautiful menu with a little something for everyone. This place will leave you satisfied and wanting more all at the same time.   Lighting- I understand they were going for a very noir feel, however, it's like eating in a closet. There's almost no light and it makes the presentation of these wonderful dishes really fall flat.   As far as the drinks, They need to step it up a notch in order to meet the menu standards. Cocktails were strange selections to pair with the dishes, and wine list was lacking a few that every good list should require.   The communication between staff, and menu knowledge needs to improve as we had to clarify orders twice.   With a few small changes, I really believe this place can be top notch.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place, and honestly, i think the reason why the hubby and I didn't enjoy it is becauSe we let our waiter choose our dishes, we knew we were taking a risk.   The entrance and decor is very chic ! You enter through a pawn shop, and then there is a hidden door. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. Our drinks came out promptly, but i wasn't a fan of the drinks either. My husband ordered two old fashions and i had a bubbly berry and another lemony drink. Both were too sweet for my liking.   Now onto our dishes! Our first course was the tuna wonton tacos and yellowtail sashimi. They were both delicious and refreshing. Specially the sauce that came with the yellowtail sashimi. So we started off good. Second course, was some Mexican arepas style mini bites and a street corn style ravioli. Being Mexican myself, it was not what i was expecting but the ravioli actually tasted pretty accurate. But we were already feeling full, bc the ravioli was super fulfilling. Our third course was pork (pastor style) medium cooked. This is where it got bad for us. The flavors were good, and tasted very similar to pastor meet from a taco stand in Los Angeles, but the problem was that we don't eat pork ! I know the waiter asked if we had any restrictions, and we said no but that's because we are not used to eating pork. He noticed we didn't like it and was very nice and offered to take it off our check, and brought something else, he brought chicken lettuce wraps. They were good and refreshing. Along with the lettuce wraps, were some green beans that were delicious! I couldn't stop eating them. Our forth and final course was dessert!  We got the milkshake shots and a carrot cake a salted caramel ice cream. I absolutely loved the the dessert!!   I am still debating whether i should go back to the one in LA and give it another chance. My hubby says he would go back, so maybe we will and we will be the ones to choose our dishes!",

It's too loud, you can't even hear the people sitting at the table talk unless they're in your ear (this is not a club or lounge.  I don't get it).  The food was toooooo salty and extremely mediocre.  Did I already mention that everything was salty??  Service was ridiculously slow!  Took over 20 mins to get our first round of drinks!  Took 3 hours to eat here, and we didn't even do a tasting menu; everything was ordered a la carte.  If you're looking for quality go elsewhere, if you're trying to be seen, then I guess this place will serve your purpose.  The empanadas were good.",

The place has zero sound dampening. The crowd wasn't a young one, either. Mostly late 30s/early 40s convention people. Not at all conducive to conversation.  Service was polite but extremely rushed. They looked like they couldn't wait to churn the table. Dishes arrived all at once instead of coursed out as they should. If this restaurant was in Italy, dinner would have taken twice as long and been all the better for it.  Cocktails were obviously prepared by a \"mixologist\" who is more interested in being \"creative\" than putting out good drinks. None of the three we tried were worth the money.  Food was a mixed bag. The wedge salad was good (how hard is it to screw up?) with a tasty buttermilk blue cheese dressing. The chorizo arancini were way too dense for the dish. Aioli was bright and helped. The standout small plate was the grilled cheese and bacon/tomato soup dumplings. Creative and delicious. The short rib mac & cheese was a tremendous disappointment. Very bland and dry. Like they ran out of cheese and flavor half-way through prep.  Desserts were top notch. The pot du creme surpasses even that served at Wynn Country Club, while the New York donuts were light, airy, melt in your mouth gems.  All in all, Beauty & Essex is a place I'm glad we tried, but I'd never go back to. There are much better places to eat at Cosmopolitan, where they don't rush you and actually care about the food and drink they serve.",

The ambience was very cool- sort of dark with leather chairs, big booths, and tons of art on the walls. It was pretty loud, though.   The food is tapas-style, and our server recommended ordering 3-5 dishes per person. We had 2.5 for each of us, which was plenty (4 girls), although the portions are by no means overwhelming. We had the Thai shrimp, which was the best dish we ordered. We also had BBQ fries (fries with some BBQ-y dust on them), mushroom flatbread, poke tacos, and 2 of the tomato soup with grilled cheese wontons. They really hype up the grilled cheese/ tomato wontons but you should know that you're just going to get a wonton spoon with a little bit of soup and a cheese ball in it.   I also had the emerald gimlet, which was very refreshing and basil-y.   We were only there for about an hour, but it seemed like our server was trying to get us out asap. We hadn't made decisions about food when she brought our drinks, which we ordered pretty much as soon as we sat down, but she stood there and waited at the table until we decided and ordered. For a pricey place, it would have been nice to get better service and a little more food.",

I was really surprised with the chicken meatballs, my friend recommended them to me and they were incredibly tasty.

It is definitely a bit pricey, but it is worth it with great food, atmosphere, and drinks. I would recommend the grilled cheese dumplings- never had anything like it, they were great! Also the yellowtail sashimi was delicious, as well as the ahi tuna tacos, and the roasted Brussels. There were two of us and that is everything we ordered, and we left full and satisfied!",

    "text": "It was about as empty as the stands of a Los Angeles Rams game when we dined here on a Sunday night.   Beauty & Essex isn't a Vegas OG, but at least it fits in there (especially inside Cosmo). And nobody is telling them that they should've just stayed in NYC.  Things were pretty chill at the start, but a dose of energy was injected into the place once upbeat music (largely from the 90s) came on. The effects of the libations began to kick in. Service was on - plates came out left and right. A few other parties trickled in. It was already more exciting than being at an NFL game in LA (well, so is watching grass grow).  But when it came to the menu, the \"Accessories\" and \"Shared Plates\" were more intriguing to me than their \"Mains.\" It was as if we only selected the Mains we did out of a feeling of obligation that we should get some dishes from that part of the menu. A few didn't seem to square with their upscale image, and it was actually some of their smaller plates that impressed the most. For that reason, I'd recommend B&E as more of a 'drinks and apps' type of place.  4 STAR WORTHY *Drinks: BEAUTY ELIXIR and PINK PANTHER - these are both gin based cocktails *FRENCH ONION SOUP DUMPLINGS: WOW! These bad boys were HOT! This creative dish stood out above everything else, the melted layer of cheese on top might mask that these are in fact dumplings  *ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: sprouts are in now, and B&E is in the game with their version featuring applewood bacon  *OVEN BRAISED CHICKEN MEATBALLS: can't go wrong with wild mushrooms and truffle  3 STAR WORTHY *ROASTED BONE MARROW: not bad, but I've had better  *KALE & APPLE SALAD: refreshing, but not remarkable  *STREET THAI BBQ CHICKEN: this was pretty average   We opted to get dessert elsewhere inside Cosmo,  but i was tempted to stop at their stylish PAWN SHOP (which is their entrance/exit ) on the way out to snag that Notorious B.I.G. doll (pictured).",

You enter through a pawn shop and they open a secret door to go into a classy, dark, and trendy restaurant. We made a reservation so we were seated right away. We were a group of 6 and were seated at a table that was definitely meant for 4. Despite being a bit over-crowded, I still started off impressed. Knowing the portions are smaller and meant to be shareable, we ordered several dishes. Unfortunately, we didn't get 2 of the plates. The rest of the table finished their food while two people still didn't get anything. When confronting the server to ask what the status was of the rest of our food, she was bewildered at what we could possibly be bothering her for. She told us she would ask the kitchen. Ten minutes later, we tried to flag her down again for an update and she said, \"They didn't start it yet so I told them not to make it.\" Enter confused Nick Young meme here. We just asked for the bill at that point. They did bring out complimentary donuts for the birthday girl at the table, but the irony is the birthday girl was the one who didn't get her meal. But hey, at least they gave her donuts instead? Overall, while we had high hopes to start, the food that we did get was just okay (warning about the spaghettini: make sure you LOVE pesto if you get this dish, because it is completely overpowering), and the service was completely disappointing.",

First, I'm not sure what the capacity is in the place but considering they literally jam pack all the tables in I'm thinking they maybe over \"comfortable\" capacity lol. Our chairs were touching the chairs around us and we are not huge big people. Picture this we did have a group of 10 but when our server was one one side of the table in order to get to the other side of our table she had to walk around the table that was next to us. Seriously, she had to go around another table?!!! BC that is how close the chairs were. Totally uncomfortable seating BC even the people at our own table were elbow to elbow. Now granted the booth eating or tables on the outer edge of the restaurant did seem to have more room. But geez if you dont have seating for a large party just say so, dont make it up.   As for the food it was ok. Nothing too unique that would draw in someone on food alone. I will give props for the grilled cheese, tomato soup. Loved how it was served on individual spoons and the soup itself was really good. Tuna poke tacos very good!! Yellowtail sashimi, disappointing,  being an avid sushi lover it definitely didnt taste fresh at all and for that price you would think it would be somewhat fresh.   Service was great. She was friendly, attentive and you could tell she was working hard especially since it was almost impossible to get to parts of our table.",

And its a great place for sharing.  The staff was great and attentive.    Here is what we had.  Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche - jalapeno, mango, crispy corn tortilla Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - chiffonade cilantro, radish, wasabi kewpie Yellowtail Sashimi - pickled jalapeno, barrel-aged fuji apple ponzu Shrimp Cocktail - charred jalapeno cocktail sauce East & West Coast Oysters Avocado, Lemon & Espelette toast  Tomato & Creamy Burrata toast - sweet & sour tomato agrodolce, micro basil 'Chile Relleno' Empanadas - poblano, manchego, jalapeno-lime crema Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings Mediterranean Cauliflower - pickled shallots, mint, yogurt Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings - miso honey mustard and sambal ketchup Chorizo \"Carbonara\" 'Mac & Cheese' - Spanish chorizo, sweet peas, ancho breadcrumbs Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs - sheeps milk ricotta, wild mushroom, truffle Spaghettini - zucchini, lemon, parsley pesto, parmigiano, sunny-side up egg Mexican Street Corn Ravioli - roasted poblano creme, jalapeno, cotija, cilantro Tandoori Spiced Chicken - curried cauliflower, almonds, grape  I loved both of the toasts we had.  Great flavors on both.  Also loved the onion rings.  Nice and crisp, easy to eat.  The shrimp cocktail had big shrimp and a spicy cocktail sauce.  Yum.  The meatballs were really good too.  Loved the ricotta with it.  That was the best part.  Overall everything was super flavorful and tasty.  Great for sharing.  The restaurant has a fun vibe.  You actually have to walk through a pawn shop to get to the entrance.  Then its sort of dark and mysterious inside.  A fun place!",

We were so confused lol! And then this girl directed us to a back door, then that's where everything was really at. The place is dark, too dark for my liking, especially cause I like to see my food. My eyes are always the first thing that meets the food so I'm big on that. I got the Korean bbq boa, and the buns are hard on the outside and soft on the inside. That really bothered me. To me, when I eat bao, I want it to be soft everywhere. The flavor was mediocre. My boyfriend got the chicken tiki, which had a really sour flavor. We had to add Tabasco to it.  The appetizers were yummy though, my favorite is the yellowtail.  Since it was considered an upscale restaurant, I figured the server would at least do something for my cousin ESPECIALLY because we told her we were here for her birthday and she encouraged it.  Overall experience, food is 3/5 and the server was pretty nice. Environment, I would have preferred it with a little more light.",

Now, nifty pawn shop from is still cool, but what is beyond is better. Surprise, its actually a large and very cook restaurant in the back. What's better is the food. I'm all about the food and service. Variety is good but the quality is excellent as they offer broad base of menu to include Vegas! Yes, vegan and its not bad. If you'r in vegas and you're looking for a decent atmosphere and best of all good food and service, this is the place. Yes, people care about how you are! They come by and ask about your food, and service not to mention a good old fashion conversation of caring. Give it a shot as lot of restaurants in vegas and it can get kind of muddy. For my friends!",

Nice atmosphere inside lights dimmed low gives it a nice romantic vibe. For apps we had the grilled cheese and tomato soup bites which were amazing, the Mac and cheese which was absolutely to die for please please order it you'll be happy you did, and the avocado toast which were very tasting and refreshing. Main meal I had the spaghettini which was a parsley pesto. It was a great size portion and cooked perfectly to an al dente that I enjoy. My wife had the salmon and she always gets that from there and she loves it. Would love to go back again soon",

Ordered flatbread, ricotta meatballs, bao burger buns, bacon mac n cheese tomatoes soup bites and star of the night tiramisu sundae.  I'm not a sweets guy I actually never order dessert.

    "text": "Beauty & Essex - heavy on the style points, but there are some issues.  Hubby and I were very excited to come here.  The premise of it - a pawn shop facade housing a rousing bunch of party guests behind it - was all very clever and fun.  But oh my goodness - this place is a perfect example of how atmosphere can equally reflect on a restaurant just as much as it's food - and not always in a good way.  But first, what we ate:  Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos - good, but the raw tuna presented a texture issue for me Wedge Salad - heavy (as bleu cheese just is) but very good Roasted Bone Marrow with Onion Marmalade - good but not the best I've ever had; Jean George inside Aria is my favorite Grilled Cheese Tomato Soup Dumplings - their most popular and really quite a unique take on something so familiar; loads of creamy cheese inside; however, it was just too thick with cheese for me Chuck Sliders - good; order by the EACH, which is good as I don't always want a trio of sliders Onion Rings - homemade; always a plus!  We wanted to have dessert but we couldn't bring ourselves to it.  Not because of the food, which was fine.  It was the NOISE.  This restaurant is the noisiest place I've ever been to, and I've eaten fine dining all across the U.S.  It was awful.  The dining room was packed to the gills with tables, lights were very dimmed, and the hum of voices was so loud, all I felt was claustrophobia.  I could not enjoy my meal AT ALL.  We had to get out of there - fast.  Probably the quickest fine dining meal of my life.  I recommend this place to people if they are okay with noise and tight spaces.  Because the food is fine.  We liked what we ate.  But considering the atmosphere, I'd always make a point to mention it before a full-on recommendation.  Maybe one day they will re-work the aesthetic and then we would definitely give it another go.",

The portions may be on the smaller side, but each dish was so fresh, plated beautifully, and of course delicious.  We ordered the tuna poke wonton tacos, yellowtail sashimi, mediterranean salad, grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings, and the basil pesto ravioli -- I don't have a single minor critique about each dish I ordered.  The decor was also on point!  Love that the restaurant is hidden behind a pawn shop.  When you walk through the mystery door, you are welcomed by a lively atmosphere.  The walls are full of mirrors and  the walls dividing the dining rooms are made of frames with hanging jewelry.  What a unique interior decor!",

Everything we ordered did not disappoint.  While it did take a while for the food to arrive the wait staff was very professional.   What made the experience disappointing was the level of noise inside the restaurant.  I'm not sure it it was all the old mirrors or kitsch interior design but it was prohibitive to conversation.  Yes I can read lips but felt completely over stimulated and would have preferred a a quieter dinning experience given the money I paid.  It was very expensive.  About 125.00 a person.    A talented Chef undone by the ambition of a restauranteur trying to make things current/cool and pushing to pack in as many people as possible with no regard for how it would affect the dinning experience.",

The Busboy, I'm guessing, wasn't too pleased with me when I asked for new flatware. He ignored me the rest of the night after he rolled in a table for a larger party sitting next to my table (he hit my friend with the table and didn't apologize either) and didn't refill my drink (6/23).

The food was mediocre and way over priced for the quantity. What concluded was that the waitress expressed that our billed could not be split and that she'd have to get the manager approval for splitting the bill. When she returned, she said she could split the bill 4 ways and that's the best they could do and walked away without any apologies. If you're looking to come here, just know it's appetizers and  a loud ambiance, that's all you'll get.",

I was solo and she was pleasant to speak with.  The fries were a bit too crispy and the burger maybe a little too fired but I enjoyed my meal. I had the Woodsman cocktail and it was great.

We hung out at the bar while we waited for our table. It was fairly crowded but in a good way. The DJ was awesome, she played a great mix of music! Once at our table, we had quite the dining experience! Just loved it! Everything from the decor, to the roving beauties, to the food, made this an awesome experience. But I have to say that the best part and the reason why I enjoy any place is the service! The service here was excellent! The bartenders, our server, and everyone we encountered, was super welcoming and genuinely nice but still super cool! Looking forward to going there again!",

    "text": "Don't bother making a reservation, it won't be honored in a timely manner and they hold a credit card and do not allow you to cancel with 48 hrs of your reservation or who knows what the consequences would have been if we didn't show up it was never disclosed to me as to why my credit card was necessary to hold the table. We arrive we wait well over an hour to be seated, when seated we were placed in an awkward half circle booth with a chair on the end and in the back corner of the room next to the waiter station, probably the worst table in the entire place. The noise of the room was awful, deafening, so loud when our waitress finally walked up and asked how we were, the birthday girl, (yes I said birthday girl whose night was just about ruined by this dinner) said \"we are pretty disgruntled\" and our waitress only laughed and then asked if we wanted cocktails, when we declined because we had plenty of time waiting to get a cocktail or several out front, she promptly asked would we like any of the 4 different waters out there and said I'll just get you some ice water but decided we didn't need ice upon filling our glasses. Most of the food actually tasted good but there is some breakdown between ordering and actually receiving it. Our appetizers trickled out. We had 6 people each couple ordered an appetizer for sharing but for someone reason we would get one and then wait again 10-20 minutes for the next one, and then it was time to get ready for the big wait, actually receiving an entree. 1020pm is when we finally received our dishes, meantime during the wait we had time to witness a stack of trays falling and nearly hitting one of our party members in the head, a water girl hitting another water guy in the head with a water pitcher, a waiter digging in a bag behind our round seat for whatever another one trying to get around him so causing one to pretty much step into our dining area standing between me (the unlucky one in the added chair to the table aka the uncomfortable 6th wheel spot to the half circle table) let me tell you this table got a lot of passerby action but not so much attention. Drink glasses left unfilled, empty dishes on the table etc. The esthetics are lovely but it is overshadowed by horrible time management and service. One complaint about the food would have to be the 10 oz thick cut filet for $48. I love steak and this was almost inedible. In that the rub used was so spicy I literally cut every side of this steak off and only consumed the middle section. And trust me I'm Cajun. I eat spicy each and every day. But I am also usually aware when I'm going to consume something spicy and thick cut filet for $48 is definitely not something one expects to be spicy. And it was almost a reminder of a pepperoni type of spice. It was a very poor decision to ruin a beautiful cut of meat that way. I literally was unable to consume at least 4 oz  If not more of the 10 oz steak. I was really excited about this restaurant, but that excite was definitely ruined and sadly there will not ever be a return visit. Even more sad I didn't even mention a few other things that happened during dinner because it was too much to type.",

It's hard to choose which one was better - but if you are a fan of butterscotch you will LOVE it. The atmosphere is really amazing - pretty chill and not pretentious as most Vegas restaurants can be.

Food was good but the entire experience didn't make up for the quality of the food.  I even had an encounter with the manger about the disappointing birthday surprise and he Jesse Woods I think was his name could care less.  He definitely didn't care if I came back or not so I won't!  If you can go to STK, right next door, never a bad meal, they must train their wait staff because they are always on point, all 100 times I have been their the staff of amazing! Their managers care.

The pulled chicken arepas are not anything like traditional arepas - they are a small wafer with some plain, cold chicken on top (at least as we received it).  It tasted like homemade chicken salad and was not impressive.  The fish and chips tacos were good - probably the best dish we tried.  The chicken meatballs' taste was a little offputting, almost like it was gamey.  The short rib mac and cheese was good but would have been better had it been warmer.

I love that you walk into a pawn shop. We were able to take pictures behind the counter which was hella cool. As you walk back to the host stand, the vibe changes. Dark speak easy feel. Very VIP feeling with the elegance chandeliers. Restaurant presentation alone gets me so excited. Service is also on point. Food was just ok for me. Maybe it was so hyped up, but it was so so. I spent more here than Mastros the night before and did not enjoy it as much. We started with the highly recommended tomato soup dumplings - delicious as you would imagine, but not something I would order again due to the price. Next we had the chicken meatballs- just so so. I was hoping for more flavors. Then we had the filet, which was super tender but again the flavor in the meat alone was just ok. They did provide roasted garlic and a few sauces, which made it more tasteful. We decided to try the Caesar toast and the pasta last minute. The chicken skin crumbles on the toast made the dish. I personally don't like the focaccia bread. Seems a little dense but I also understand it needs to be stiff enough for the food. The pasta was just so so as well. The pasta was not quite al dente. The chorizo was flavorful with hint of spicy. Overall, I still enjoyed my experience. I may just wait a few more years to come back again.",

    "text": "Christmas Dinner 2017 -- This proved to be a completely enjoyable dining experience for an essential holiday evening dinner. Go adventurous with cocktails such as O.D.B. \"Old Dirty Bramble\" and Velvet Orange. If you start off as we did with the surprising grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings, you will be dazzled with the attention to detail in combining the ingredients and then the presentation in small tasting spoons. The same can be said for the pulled chicken arepas, the dry aged chuck sliders, and the Mexican street corn ravioli. But, do not overdo on preliminary items because the main course awaits you. The classic thick cut filet is perfection. Same can be said for the Tandoori spiced chicken. For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the bite-size LES, NYC doughnuts or the peanut butter pie sundae. As experienced local diners in Las Vegas, we were so pleased with our entire Beauty & Essex night.",

    "text": "The short review: 4 star food, 2 star service.  Beauty & Essex is a highly pretentious and over-priced \"speak-easy tapas bar\" with mediocre service, horrible acoustics, and your typical rowdy vegas crowd.  Its only redeeming quality is the fantastic food.  If you want less pretentiousness and better service, go to Cleo.   The long version:  The restaurant was largely empty when I arrived for a reservation at 6pm for me and 6 friends. We had a last minute add-on and wanted a table for 8, but the hostess up front gave us misinformation saying that we had to wait to be seated when the whole party arrived or if we were seated early they would kick us out at 7:45pm. We decided to wait at the bar. Then when we went to get seated at around 6:30, she said we missed our reservation by 1.5 hours (wrong) and that we would need to give back the table at 7:45p. This made no sense as the restaurant was largely empty at the time, and the idea that a restaurant (a high-end one at that) would have a seating time limit is odd. She also clearly had our timing off. But whatever, we get seated at a table and our waitress comes by and states that \"we must be in a hurry and that we'll need to leave by 7:45\". Again, what is with these people trying to get rid of us?? Luckily we were able to clarify this situation with management, but it definitely didn't start our evening off well.   The hidden restaurant is sneakily located behind a faux \"pawn shop\" with a cool secret entrance and fabulous decor. It's a cool spot that makes you feel swanky and part of the in-crowd just because you know about the place. The interior is dark and lush and very romantic. But other than that, the restaurant is not very well thought out. First, no restroom in the restaurant (I guess that might be a vegas thing?). Second, the whole seating area is filled with 4 person tables that are basically touching each other, and more than once wait staff dropped dishes. I can only imagine this is bc the restaurant is hard to move around. Third, the acoustics were absolutely terrible. I could barely hear the person sitting next to me, let alone others at my table or the waitress herself! The atmosphere, while dark and seemingly intimate, is not conducive to enjoying other people's company.   However, the food is phenomenal. Dishes are small plates meant for sharing and the prices are pretty high. But man, the food is GOOOOOOD. We all ordered about 3 dishes per person and shared amongst the table. Would highly recommend:  1. French Onion Soup Dumplings - Incredible. Cheesy. Flavorful. Bite-sized deliciousness.  2. Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings - It's the perfect combo of tomato soup and grilled cheese in one bite.  3. Garganelli - One of the best pasta dishes I've had in a long time 4. Thai style deep fried shrimp - Very tasty, not too sweet, not too salty, and shrimp was fresh.  5. ANY OF THE DESSERTS. THEY ARE ALL GOOD. (my fave was the donuts, but the devil's food layer cake with milk ice cream was also incredible).   Tips: *Get here early *Free champagne for ladies *Good for small groups *If driving to the Cosmo, park on east side and take east elevators up to 3rd floor :)",

The food wasn't the best I've had in Vegas, but that had some notable items to talk about. We started with oysters and the yellowtail sashimi.  The oysters were great, I'd pass on the yellowtail sashimi.  I then got the bone marrow toast.  The bone marrow isn't your normal sized bone marrow, it was one of the biggest I've seen, and it was delicious.  This is a must try if you are checking out this place.  We also got the chili relleno empanadas, those were good.  Next favorite item was onion rings, now who would think onion rings could taste really good, but the one they have here is he best I've had.  Next item we tried was the lobster roll, this wasn't great at all.  I got the pork chops with a side of brocollini. The brocollini was made with chili paste, possible sambas oolek, I think it's better the way it's made at STK next door.  The pork chops were cooked a perfect medium rare, but the crust was basically a lot of black peppercorn or so it tasted like.  It was spicy, but didn't hit the spot, I thought they could do something different with it.  He cocktails were good.  Their version of the old fashioned  was a hit for me.  I had the Oaxacan old fashioned, which I've had at a restaurant in Portland before, but it didn't taste as great as it did there, but still good. I'll definitely go back and try other stuff that they had on their menu.",

The French onion soup dumplings were essentially a piece of bread, a few caramelized onions and cheese. Very dry and minimal flavor. The chicken arepas was chicken salad on three pieces of what tasted like rice crackers.  I've had amazing arepas and sadly there was no resemblance.   We spent $90 on two drinks and three apps and had to go to Secret Pizza for a slice because we were still hungry.",

I will say that the front \"Pawn Shop\" idea doesn't work as well in a high-end hotel, as it does on the streets on NYC, but inside is beautiful.   Service: Top Notch.

We had the tomato soup grilled cheese, empenadas, the mushroom pizza, and the fries. Everything was very aesthetically appealing and service was great. Minus the part where I told them it was my birthday, and I saw them bring the couple next to us a birthday dessert with a candle, and they didn't do s*** for me. Whatever though.  Everything tasted good, but Trader Joe's good. Like they went to the frozen section and bought different appetizers and plated them all pretty, and maybe put in a half ass effort for the sauces to make them a little extra. The grilled cheese tomato soup was the best out of those, but the soup part tasted like Annie's canned tomato soup, and the grilled cheese tasted like Trader Joe's cheese quiches. It was also soooo loud that you can't even hear your waiter. That's all I've got to really say.",

We were quickly seated and the music was loud,but really helped with the buzz.  All plates are meant to be shared & we ordered 4 full of flavor and great presentation.  Cauliflower - delicious! Apple & kale salad - my favorite! So fresh, light, and flavorful  Tomatoes soup grilled cheese won tons - served on little spoons and packed with delicious cheesy flavor like weekend lunches back in elementary school! Chicken arrapas  - tiny adorable puffs with great presentation and lots of flavor!  Also drinks - great selection, a little pricey at $17/cocktail but delicious.

The food is tapas/family style so it's better to come here with more people. We were able to ask for 5 pieces/portions of each dish so everyone could try it without double ordering. The cocktails were delicious as well. The decor and atmosphere fits the Cosmo very well. Great spot for dinner and drinks before going to a show or club.   I particularly enjoyed the tuna poke wanton tacos, the lobster rolls, and the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings. They even offered to put the bacon on the side because two people in our group didn't eat pork.   Service was great. The waitress also gave us stamps to skip the line at Marquee. We didn't end up going that night but it's a nice perk.",

I was confused, but when I entered, there was another door that leads us to the restaurant. It felt really magically, it was like entering a whole new world! I was then greeted by tall and gorgeous hostesses. The moment I stepped in the restaurant, I was continuously in awe with the decor and furniture.   Ambience: The ambience was really relaxed and intimate. The dimmed lighting and soft background music  made it feel romantic in a way. I definitely recommend this for first dates, second dates, third dates, girls night, etc.  Service: The service was excellent, I had about 4 different staff check up on me to see if everything is ok and if I would like to order another drink. Even though the restaurant got really busy, they didn't rush me at all and I was there for about 2 hours just enjoying the decor, food, and drink.  Food: one word, AhMaaaaZinggg! I had the grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling which consisted of 6 dumplings on a spoon and the grilled mushroom pizzetta (goat cheese, truffle oil, herbs, and mushrooms). I paired that with the platinum peacock (virgin cocktail). The platinum peacock was so refreshing and sweet, perfect for a hot day when you're not feeling like drinking alcohol and want something different.",

I'm glad I did.  From start to finish, our meal was fantastic and exceeded my expectations.   So it is a jewelry store our front, lol, which confused me as the door to the restaurant is somewhat disguised like a hidden door. But once you get in, there is no mistaking it.   A warning now: if you wanted a private, intimate dinner, go somewhere else. B&E is crazy loud. Reminds me of being in a club at South Beach. You will have to lean in and yell to have conversation. Definitely a lot of energy.  Normally this is not my cup of tea, but I can make exceptions for extraordinary food. The menu is setup for sharing with small plates, so for 2 people we had 5 plates. Wagyu sliders, tomato soup and cheese pot stickers, pork belly, lamb chops, and a lamb Bolognese pasta.  Each and every plate was amazing. I really didn't think it would be, but they were all perfect. Each of them were very unique, and we felt they all hit the spot.  For dessert, we had the carrot cake and smores. Both also good, but perhaps not as unique or creative.  Regardless, an excellent meal and something I would come back to with proper hearing protection. :)",

For my cocktail I went with the Pink Panther which was made with gin and peppercorn and a very loving and kin and amazing bartender because it was one of the strongest drinks I've had at a stripside restaurant but also tastyyyyyyy. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Got to try the Beauty Elixir which was also very good but sweeter.  For our plates that came out we received yellowtail sashimi (always a good choice), avocado toast (not my favorite to ever get at restaurants but this was surprisingly good and would order again), kale and apple salad (so good and one my personal favorites from the night) lobster tacos, and the god damned spaghettini (pesto and eggs and delicious carbs, this is the numba one favorite).  Finished off with a fancy round of shots because we were fancy like that. And definitely spoiled. Thank you Beauty & Essex!  Still so many things on the menu I would like to try - will definitely be back.",

Unfortunately, I am highly disappointed by my dining experience and can't recommend this restaurant. The food was tasty and perfectly satisfying, as was the ambiance, I think.  The problem is we were so rushed through our meal by our server that I barely had time to enjoy any of it. Only moments after placing our order the food arrived, quicker than some fast-food restaurants I've been to. We were never even asked if we would like a second cocktail, the plates were promptly cleared, and then the bill arrived.  The message was clear, the restaurant values turning tables, not customers.",

From my experience, the Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Dumplings are a must. Very unique, and an homage to a favorite dish of childhood past. Not only are these a cool little touch that taste good, but you'll never see anything like it elsewhere.  The Maple Glazed Pork Belly is very rich and if you like bacon, this will be right up your alley.  Overall, there are a few unique items that are really great, but the main course(s) are nothing to write home about. It's a little loud (not a negative, but be aware), but the atmosphere alone is worth a visit. On top of that, it's fairly affordable compared to other Strip counterparts.",

    "text": "This was one of two special, standout meals during my trip to Vegas for a bachelorette party over Labor Day weekend. Everything here is tapas style, so it's good to come with a group and share. But even with two people, all you really need is a few dishes and dessert for a full meal.  The vibe here is really bustling (and LOUD). It's pretty dark but there's cool, classy decor. You enter through a pawn shop of sorts with interesting, edgy trinkets that I unfortunately didn't get to really look at much, but the ladies who greet you are really nice and smiley. The crowd leans younger and well dressed, but definitely some older groups as well and people not dressed up for a night out. Either way, it's a good time!  The standout, and what they're famous for, is the grilled cheese tomato soup bites. That doesn't sound like much, but it's so well executed, and the moment that you get to the part with the cheese inside the bite of bread is just...life's small pleasures that you live for, haha. I only wish that I could have more than one of them! There were 4 of us and it came in 6.  We got 5 tapas (the waiter actually pointed out that our order was heavy and if we wanted any veggies...hahah hmm ok then), and they were all delicious. Another standout is the tuna poke tacos, very clean tasting and fun to eat.   Service is great too and our waters kept getting refilled. But awkward that for whatever reason, our waiter thought we were celebrating a birthday...and brought us out complimentary happy birthday cake (really it's truffles on a stick) pop. We also ordered dessert (s'mores) and that ended up being free because of the mistake/misunderstanding. The s'mores were interesting (not what you'd have at the beach) and the cookie is more like a graham cracker flavored puff crisp of sorts, which I'm sure takes some gourmet chef genius to do, but overall the \"s'mores\" were disappointing. The complimentary cake pops were actually better and hit the spot; very rich, so all you need is one max. I wish we had stuck with their most popular dessert -- donuts/beignets which looked generous with a bowl of them and three dipping sauces. Maybe next time!",

Cool lighting fixtures, mature modern decor, and generously open rooms that flow gracefully one to another set to a smooth soundtrack of hip hop classics make this spot a hidden winner. The pawn shop entrance is a fun decoy, but I feel like it could be executed just a tad bit better.  Drinks are slightly overthought here. Even the bevvies on the \"sweet\" side tasted like plants. And I tasted a lot of them. Think hipster mixologist with curled moustache and a tight vest making them. (but in reality it was a hot chick with long, pretty hair and a short dress)  So many food options, and my group tried most of them. 3 out of 6 of us have food allergies, and staff was only semi-attentive to that when bringing dishes to the table. We were constantly asking \"Does this have nuts?\"  Most of our selections were decadent and well executed, however a few details went missed here and there like burnt burger buns. The tomato tartare seemed to be a crowd favorite, but the Thai chicken was super bland. A dessert platter came out aiming to please, but the L.E.S. donuts had a choking amount of sugar on them. Apparently \"Les is more\" here.  High profile hideaway with high prices to match. Wouldn't really consider this fine dining, but it is an experience to have at least once while in Vegas. Good try, Cosmo. Definitely fits the brand.",

Instead we were met with average music, an awkward neither here nor there vibe, a rude waiter and average restaurant staff overall, and seriously disappointing food. Every single item we ordered was significantly worse than the NYC version and the experience was just sad overall. That said, if you are from a smaller town and have never been to another version of this restaurant, you might think it's good.

I'm a huge fan of French onion soup and these dumplings were better than any soup I've ever tried! Once the soaked bread hits your tongue, you then taste the sweet onions and hot soup come in and then all that melted cheese all over them and a crispy crouton for texture! My goodness! Please don't skip this item when you come here...  So the menu is a lot of fun and inspires you to share small plates. We also tried the Maine lobster rolls. I loved the baked roll itself but I didn't care for the filling that in my opinion had too many crunchy components. The scallops and charred corn were orgasmic with a great Spanish twist and the Garganelli pasta dish with sweet & spicy bolognese and whipped ricotta rocked my world!   It was V Day so we also had to end on a sweet note. Decided to try the Kygo cloud nine s'mores and let me just say that I made a loud sound after the first bite! Another holy crap moment! So rich & decadent and that marshmallow cloud will live on in my dreams forever!   We loved this place! Cool music! Fun atmosphere along with elegant & unique decor! Great and extremely fast & attentive service! We will definitely be back for more French onion soup dumplings and other items we want to try!",

    "text": "LOVED this place and was BLOWN AWAY by their vegan menu! I was the only vegan at our table so when all the courses kept coming around I got to indulge in everything they had to offer! Was so impressed by the entry dish which was a faux sashimi. It was so cool! The seasoned fries were amazing but I loved the Beyond Burger meatballs (they tasted so real that I spit it out and ask them if they were vegan) HAHA! The avocado toast was divine along with another dish that I can't remember. It had a relish and tomatoes and watermelon salad on the side. Oh! That's right. It was the tempeh \"baked chicken\" and the Thai-style deep fried tempeh was awesome. That was my fav! Reminded me of buffalo wings. I will definitely be back since I'm a local! I even spotted some NBA players at one table and Chantel Jeffries at another. Fun night!",

Everyone was very kind and accommodating, especially after we told them we had to see a show and be out in an hour and a half. Our server, Jenny, was very helpful. Initially, she gave us food suggestions, but given that we had such a large party, she recommended doing a bachelorette prix fixe menu at $40/person and talked to the chef about which plates to serve us based on dishes we already expressed interest in.  From what I remember, we had the tomato soup dumpling, tomato tartar, sashimi tacos, yellowtail sashimi, a shrimp dish, the veal bolognese, steak filet, onion rings, Brussels sprouts. The food came out quickly and efficiently, and it was all delicious--our favorites being the first 4 dishes I listed. It was definitely enough food for our entire group.  Also, as many people have written, the restaurant is gorgeous with amazing decor. I would highly recommend Beauty and Essex to any large group wanting a nice meal for a special occasion!",

This is a cool trendy restaurant that serves tappas (small plates, unfortunately) of delicious food. it's a cool trendy hip spot with cool people. There was a lounge with a sexy female dj and different rooms to dine in. My waitress was a little slow but they were busy so some other guy stepped in. I ordered the Thai Style Shrimp which was delicious. i wanted dessert so I got the birthday shot (delicious, I could have had 10 of them, should have said it was my birthday, might have got one for free) anyway... and the Les NY donuts with fudge, berry and carmel sauce (delicious) This is a trendy cool restaurant that makes it seem like a speak easy. You walk into what appears to be a store with jewelry and guitars. The attendant says nothing. I asked to see the restaurant and he buzzed me into a plane door, which when opened, out pops music, screaming and a party atmosphere. Definitely a place to try!",

    "text": "I am totally a fan of kitschy spaces, I don't mind loud spaces, nor do I mind tapas/shared plates spaces. While I enjoyed the atmosphere quite a bit, this place is quite the comedy of errors. It's funny to look back on the meal and laugh at how silly this place is in nearly every way.   Staff must be told to be a bit snark/snobby and to aggressively push not only sharing but that only ONE person per table to order. They must realize how comically loud the place is. Don't get me wrong, I like hubbub and loud restaurants are fine with me, but this is a bit goofy. Another reviewer shared that each plate had literally a bit of food for each person- and some of them really, truly were a bit or 1/2 a bite. I've eaten at many tapas places, but this was sort of shameful. It's great to share and have shared opportunities but this place could really leave even a weight-watching crowd quite hungry. The prices are off because the quality of the food is not that high. I would be more ok with the small/micro-portions of some of the plates if the food was of high quality. One of the plates LITERALLY tasted like a cheap child's lunch- like one of those Lunchables that kids might take for a school lunch. It tasted like processed food on white bread.   What was funny to me was how off the proportions were. Some of the tapas were so tiny while others were WAY too big. For example, the avocado toast looked so unappetizing because there was the most disgusting pile on top of what ended out seeming like a small piece of bread (which it probably wasn't). The burrata appetizer had an enormous amount of this almost cloyingly sweet tomato base to it that you could not really taste the cheese. At least if there would have been a bit of salt on the burrata to offset some of the sweetness. The flavor palate of the chef(s) seems quite off at this resto and the balance between plate sizes. It doesn't seem like a well-thought out menu for an executive chef-led resto and therefore, for a discerning foodie.   The dessert tray was astonishingly blah. Carrot cake seemed ok while the pot de creme was gritty. The donuts were truly about the best part of the entire meal. The chocolate sauce with the donuts had a gross consistency. There was a strange blob that was nearly flavorless on the plate that none of us could detect what it actually was supposed to be.   Finally, the staff was not very helpful. The host staff were the most friendly and the security-like guy at the front door was the most friendly. We asked for simple things throughout the meal and we did not receive some of the or they showed up 20 minutes later. The server was aggressive and somewhat friendly- I have a feeling she is a nice person but simply the work environment is not conducive to being a pleasant person. The expediter/busser staff asked over and over if we were going to finish a few of the items on some of the plates, interrupting conversations with a group of friends who had gathered from different corners of the world to have an enjoyable evening. It was bizarre how many times they inquired as we would continue to eat a bit more and yet to be interrupted once more. One time, the same guy asked about the same two plates within a two-minuted window. Isn't that just obnoxious. And we surely weren't the dawdling type of group either.   Clearly this resto is busy, and there are many folks that want to be seen- if you are desperately into that, I guess this might be the spot for you! I typically enjoy these types of spots, but this was uninspiring, low-to-mid quality food for high prices (like I said, if the quality, presentation and inspiration were better, I'd be ok with the prices) and lousy service (granted I bet most of the folks are wonderful people- they just work in an environ that makes people unhappy and unfriendly).   Skip Beauty and Essex. Maybe come for a drink and people-watch and then go eat somewhere else excellent in Cosmo...",

I guess they want you out fast. It's their loss tho because I think people would drink more if lingering were encouraged.  Sooooo the food:  I loved the tuna tacos and the burger.  It was silly to order oysters. They were meh and we can get them at home. My partner loved the ravioli. The green beans were pretty good too. Our neighbours at the next table had enviable and gorgeous onion rings. For some reason they didn't like the mushroom salad and the staff were gracious and removed it and didn't charge them.  Our server kind of ruined the mood. She was kind of snooty about the wine. In fairness she let us return a bottle we didn't like but she wasn't warm and friendly. Quite the opposite. For me I love to chat w the server and those interactions really influence the experience. She did nothing to enhance our experience. Quite the opposite. And I felt other tables got better attention.  I would maybe go back but it's in the cosmopolitan which offers lots and lots of choice so I'd probably try another restaurant there first.",

Long lulls between \"dishes\" (small plates) so, since it is difficult to communicate, you spend a lot of time yelling and staring at your phone waiting.

I will say the cocktail I had was great, but that was the highlight. We ordered 4 dishes and they were all mediocre at best. The atmosphere was fun, kind of clubby, and loud. The room was dark, but good ambiance. Severs were great and accommodating.  Food fell very flat. With endless options in Las Vegas, we won't return.",

It is a swanky/retro/chic kinda place that is almost a speak easy style...you walk into a Pawn shop of the Cosmo and then there is a door that leads into the restaurant/bar section. The tomato grilled cheese spoons are amazing! Give it a try.",

Once in the pawnshop there is a side door or I like to call it a secret door.  You walk through the side door a short distance and we were greeted by a friendly and inviting hostess which showed us right to our table.  The staff and server were great, very attentive.  The decor was updated and intimate.  This would be a great place to take your honey on a date night.  The food is Tapas sized, unique and very delicious. The price of the food was on a little on the high side for the amount, but worth it. I would recommend checking this place out and enjoying some great food and a good time.",

I also loved the giant scallops perfectly cooked and BBQ seasoning French fries (but you need to like BBQ), crispy outside and fluffy inside. I couldn't complain about anything including the chicken meatballs, poke taco , empanadas,and mac and cheese. For a drink I had the Earl the Pearl which tastes just like an Arnold palmer.   Next time I'm back, and I WILL be back I need to try the lobster roll and one of the toasts!",

Thai pork belly was bursting with savoriness and flavor. Brussel sprouts were also a huge hit and cooked to perfection. The rib eye was everything and was the perfect dish to share. The meat was so soft and buttery. Every bite was tender and your teeth just sank right into the flesh of the meat!   Also, don't forget to try their cocktails.

    "text": "Wow, just wow!! I saved the best restaurant for last and it didn't disappoint, in fact, the food and ambiance exceeded my expectations. It was really cool and fun to walk through the pawn shop into the restaurant. I loved seeing all the guitars on the wall.  Based on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!  Based on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that's artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I'd go back for this dish alone it was so good.  Next, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I'd ever had.  Sadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine \"S\" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below.   The restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.  Amazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I'm already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.  Make this your #1 restaurant pick in Las Vegas. It's pure heaven for foodies!!",

I love hip hop classics, but not at a swanky restaurant when I'm trying to have a romantic night. The service was very good despite how busy the restaurant was. My fiance and I ordered the sirloin and while it tasted great, we both could not sleep that night because it gave us the WORST heartburn. So, although this place has it's merits, I would not return to this place...and I would never recommend it to anyone. There are much better restaurants to try in the Cosmopolitan.",

My boyfriend and I had no interest in clubbing so we chose to have a romantic date night here, and needless to say, we were not let down!   Ambience: You make your way through a brightly lit pawnshop, and open up a door to the lounge, where it is dim and quite crowded. The decor by the bar caught my eye with the red couch and art pieces on the walls. It is brimming with energy, and the loud music definitely uplifts the mood.     Food/Drinks: We ate earlier in the day so we just ordered the yellowtail sashimi and the grill cheese/bacon/tomato soup dumplings and the bubbles n berries drink. My mouth is drooling from just thinking about how savory the yellowtail sashimi was! The texture was a perfect pair of smooth and crunchy, and the flavor soaked in the taste buds. I liked the soup dumplings as well, but I personally am not a fan of the slightly overwhelming cheesiness of the dish. My favorite part of this dish would be the presentation of the dumplings in alternating soup spoons. Perfect for sharing!  Our server gave us amazing customer service, especially when he first came out with the menu and talked about some of the dishes. My only complaint of this place would be how loud it can get--my boyfriend and I resorted to yelling over the music multiple times to be heard.  All in all, it was a great choice to come here for a date night! Next time I'll hit up the LA location with my girls :)",

I tried the pulled Chicken arepas, grilled cheese, bacon and tomato soup dumplings, thai styled deep fried shrimp and roasted mushroom pizzetta.

They were very gracious and held our table for us even though we were running about 30 minutes behind schedule. You try gathering six ladies!!! It's tough!!  We went family style and decided to share everything we ordered. Our server asked us if we wanted to double a few things that came as a trio, since we had six in our party. We thought it was a great idea, but he doubled everything which was way too much food and wasn't cheap. That would be the only part of the experience that wasn't stellar. I never like to feel mislead or taken advantage of and I felt both of those things. Otherwise, the service was stellar. The wine was flowing, my water was always full, and the food was timed very well.  Highlights were the scallops and the avocado toast. Call me a millenial, but avocado toast has my heart. The bone marrow was mouthwatering with all it's little condiments. I was too full for dessert, but I'm coming back for that Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot De Creme.",

Our waiter did a great job and arranged a tasting menu for us since it was our first time here and we couldn't really decide on what we wanted to eat.  He got an idea of what types of food we wanted and also a price range and made it happen.  All the dishes were phenomenal.  We started off with some Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos and Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche.  The food first started off light and then went heavier. We then got the Caesar Toast.  Next came the french onion soup dumplings.  We then shared the tomahawk ribeye along with sides of broccolini, short rib mac and cheese, cauliflower.  The ribeye steak was amazing.  The restaurant is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo near Jaleo.  The decor is neat, on the outside of the restaurant it's set up like a pawn shop.  At first I was wondering if I was at the right place.  You enter the restaurant through the door on the right of the shop.  The decor inside kind of has a retro chic vibe going on which totally works.  After we were seated for a while, the lights got dimmer.  It was almost like a lounge vibe with the music being louder and the lights being low.  Don't expect to have any conversations with anybody sitting far away.  Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Beauty & Essex is a great example of a restaurant that oozes in style and although I personally need to come back and explore more of the menu to make a final call, the first impression is absolutely terrific.    The restaurant is located on the third floor near the restaurant village.  You'll walk through the speakeasy-like doors of the storefront before heading into a really slick and dark restaurant.  Service is absolutely on its A-Game here with lots of help and all the servers being super attentive.  Lots of people too seem to pre-game here and celebrate birthdays too in case you're wondering the crowd you'll see as well (at least on a Friday night).  You can definitely come in here however you'd like but on a weekend night, people were definitely dressed up.  We did see a young guy pretty drunk that was dancing around for a while surprisingly.    Let's get to the food.  You'll most likely notice two things - one is the numerous amounts of food options here - many with special little twists.  The second thing you'll notice is the price.  Even for a tapas restaurant, it's not super cheap and the food portions you get will be pretty small.  Be aware (and don't be that surprised - you're in the heart of the Vegas strip).  But the food itself is all fascinating and some fantastic.  For instance, the tomato soup dumplings which is a mix of grilled cheese and bacon - an absolutely FANTASTIC combination and really explodes in your mouth.  You only get a few pieces so you may have to order more.    We also had the root beer float shots (which has some alcohol mixed in) which was small but super tasty.  The drinks here by the way were super strong otherwise.  Had an old fashioned made with tequila and was surprised by how mighty strong it was.  Just a fair warning.    Beauty & Essex is a cool cat and fits in nicely at the Cosmo.  Expect to pay a bit extra for smaller dishes but come out feeling like you had a fascinating little experience.",

    "text": "Beauty and Essex is a wonderful place to dine at The Cosmopolitan! The Entrance is hidden like a speakeasy. So the restaurant is kind of hidden in the back of a pawn shop. The courses are quite small - but the server will notice you about that.   We had the tomato soup dumplings as well as the tuna tacos. We also had the Corn-Ravioli (they are awesome!!!) and the Dry-Aged Sirloin Steak.  The most exciting about Beauty and Essex is the whole atmosphere. You are seated in a dark eviroment - all heavy leather and wood! I personally liked it very much. But it might be that you have to use a electric torch to read the menu.  Cocktails are 17$ - a bit overpriced for what you get - but they were tasty.",

    "text": "Oh snap!  I first went to B&E about 7 years ago when they first opened in NYE. loved everything about it from the concept to the wonderful food (and huge menu!) to the champagne in the bathroom.  So cool!  They've been expanding and it seems that means they are sacrificing some of what I used to love.  In November I was back in NY and in March I tried the Vegas one.  Their menu has shrunk and their food is hit or miss.  Some bites I loved, some I didn't.  The Vegas atmosphere is quite hip, fresh and new.  (Vs NYC that is starting to look dated).  So, if you are looking for a scene restaurant with reasonable prices and some good food options - this is a good spot to try.  Liked: Tomato soup bites Corn ravioli (surprisingly good- I don't even like corn) Carrot cake- wow! Tacos - can't remember which kind we got  Moderate: Chili scallops  Dislikes: Tandoori chicken Brushetta",

Fun atmosphere, excellent service, outstanding food. The speakeasy pawn-shop front is a fun and unique touch.   We started with some fun cocktails while we waited - Pink Panther and Bubbles N Berries. Both were fantastic...expensive, but delicious. We got a ton of stuff, everything is served as shareables or bite sized which was great because you get to try a bite or two of everything!  Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche (tasty) Tomato Tartare (good) Grilled Peach & Burrata on toast (sooo good) Korean Fried Chicken (yummm) Crispy Vidalia Onion Rings (order them!) Mexican Street Corn Ravioli (don't miss these!) Kale & Apple Salad (very good) We also had two great desserts - the Tiramisu (which was freaking amazing) and another that I can't even recall at this point. There might have been a couple other items but these were the standouts for me. I would happily recommend Beauty & Essex and will return next time I visit Vegas! Bravo guys!",

So when I saw there was another in Vegas I had to check it out. I was here on a business trip during the week and I was able to get a reservation at a normal dinner time.   First, I'll address the elephant. This place is inside of a pawn shop!! Like a real pawn shop. You have to stop and look at some of the items here. They're really for sale.   As for food, you have to order the Grilled Cheese Dumplings which are served with Tomato Soup spoons. This is a signature item and I could eat those dumplings all night! Delicious and creamy cheese in the middle.   You also have to order the Tuna Poke Tacos. I have never been a fan of tuna or any poke, but my server said they were a hit so I trusted him. Game Changer! I am now a fan and credit Beauty & Essex for getting me out my comfort zone.",

The restaurant serves tapas style dishes and they recommend that you order 3-4 dishes per person (each dish on average cost about $20-25). I went with a friend we ordered 4 dishes between the two of us and that was more than enough food. (We ordered the grilled cheese soup dumplings, which we loved. We also ordered the Korean fried chicken, oven braised chicken meatballs, and mac and cheese, which we liked, but not enough to justify the prices.)  The restaurant had a great ambiance, but with so many great restaurants in Vegas, I'm not sure if I would go back.",

We had a group of eight, and I knew it'd be a mess with everyone trying to navigate the menu and ordering Individually, so I took the wheel and ordered for the whole table. Everything was a double order, and it was the perfect amount of food for a group of our size. First up was the Pearls of the sea seafood tower. These were a hit, and really set the tone. Any fear my guests had of me not ordering enough for the evening, quickly dissolved. Next up we're the poke tacos. These were a hit, and I probably shoulda ordered a third set. Next items were chicken meatballs, tomato tartar , scallops, Mac and cheese, and the lamb chops. The lamb chops were out of this world good, and as a person who rarely eats lamb, I will definitely be ordering this again on my next trip. Our server Candyce was amazing, and very helpful with making sure I ordered the right amount for our party. Thanks again for helping to make my mother's birthday enjoyable.",

The dining area is dark and moody, which we liked but some may not! Our waiter was prompt and gave good suggestions. He suggested six tapas between the four of us-we for seven. The Caesar toast was dissapointing... literally Caesar salad on toast- maybe I should have just expected that! The tuna poke tacos were delicious and had a crispy shell. The Mac and cheese was creamy and decadent. The salad with goat cheese was very disappointing, apparently there is \"shaved goat cheese\" well they must have shaved it into thin air because I didn't see any! The star of the dinner was definitely the grilled cheese dumplings in tomato soup, so good! We also got a bottle of wine which was nothing to sneeze at at 70 US a bottle. Overall it is an expensive place but has a great ambience and good for small groups. I wouldn't bring a big group here due to the lighting and noise.   They also brought over a cute cake pop for my upcoming birthday which was a nice touch!",

Also really enjoyed the Carbonara Mac & Cheese, Tomato Soup with Cheese Dumpling, the Scallops and the Hamachi Sashimi.  I thought the poke tacos were disappointing.  They were fine, but I didn't get much flavor.  The donuts and pot de creme were also great.  Overall, I would highly recommend coming here if you're looking for somewhere with tasty food that is swanky.",

    "text": "Seriously? Cold tomato soup and a mealy dumpling? And that's your signature dish? We basically got a whole mess of fancy plates of blah food, accompanied by a price tag that would suggest so much more. The decor is lovely, the service is fine, and the \"enter through the pawn shop\" gimmick is amusing. But at the end of the day its about the food, and at least on the night we were there, the food was pretty damn bad. Very sad we went, and will definitely go elsewhere next time we are in town.",

    "text": "We found Beauty & Essex by accident as we were wandering the Cosmopolitan.  While I did see the name on the outside of the Cosmo, it sounded more like a beauty salon business than a restaurant so didn't think much of it.    We walk into the \"pawn shop\" area and look around... only to speak one of the attendants who mentions this place is a speak easy.  Wha??  Really?  So go in because we have time for a drink.    OOhhhh!!!!!   was my first response.  Not only it is amazingly decorated, its in a way I think is just classy and chic.  I'm in.  We sit down for a drink and luckily its pretty quiet still since it was just a little after 5pm.  Had a couple of drinks and decided we would have dinner there that week if possible.  Open Table does the trick and yes, we are able to.    Couple of days later, we have dinner.   We start with the Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup dumplings which I read rave reviews about - it did not disappoint!  Then we moved on to caesar toast, mexican street corn ravioli, roasted bone marrow, k-town bao burgers and grilled lamb chops.  HOLY COW it was all good and filled us up!   The biggest surprise?  We ate like this and the tab with our drinks included was still under $200.  WTF!!  Last year we had a meal someplace that was similar and more than double... I won't mention where.    Would I go back - YOU BETCHA!  Not only is the service on point, the ambiance is just too unique.  When you sit down you feel as though you KNOW you're going to be eating good food.  Love this place. I would rate it higher if I could.  A must for anyone coming to Vegas.",

Vegas Beauty Essex is so so so much better than the LA venue.  Definitely try them out when your At Cosmo Hotel",

Best thing we had were those grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling things. Everything else was just okay. Skip the chorizo carbonara unless you want to split it with 3-4 people. It'll just fill you with carbs and isn't good enough to justify the calories.   Check my pics for food ratings on what we ordered.",

There was a live DJ on the right side of the restaurant with just the right amount of volume and another dining area to the left. We just came for drinks cause we had dinner reservations else where. We sat at the bar and Casey was super knowledgeable and friendly. We decided on the Emerald Gimlet and Green with Envy. Casey whipped up our drinks in front of us with precision all while making great small talk. The drinks were amazing! He asked us about our plans for the night and enlightened us about their dessert menu. We paid our tab and went on our way. But long and behold we came back for dessert and Casey wasn't lying the strawberry lemon short cake dessert was light and delicious. We will definitely be back next time for dinner.",

They brought each item out at different times which worked out because we had room on the table.  We got the octopus tacos, thai style deep fried shrimp, orange kissed salmon ceviche, grilled cheese dumplings, and mexican street corn ravioli.  The ravioli was my favorite, but everything was awesome.  We got the peanut butter sundae for desert.  It was massive and 3 poeple could not finish.

The menu is tapas style, so the portions are on the smaller side. My friends and I shared the kale and apple salad, the chicken meatballs w/ ricotta and truffle, the char grilled green beans, and the tuna poke wonton tacos. The salad, chicken meatballs, and the green beans were all to die for. The tuna poke tacos I've had twice now, and they're kind of forgettable. I'm also a huge fan of their Mexican street corn ravioli and their Garganelli lamb bolognese, although I haven't tried them at this location.   Ambiance is upscale and trendy. No reservations were needed on a Thursday night. Great service and recommendations from our waitress. Overall very satisfied.",

The server was so attentive with getting the drinks out quickly and keeping the table cleared.  The kitchen gets your food out to your table timely. The kitchen server who brought out the dishes was great with explaining how to get our bone marrow toast on: Spread marmalade, add the marrow, and then the salt and greens. Fantastic..  B & E cuisine:  Take a guess, you know I'm going to love the Roasted Bone Marrow toast.  Delicious and I'm definitely ordering again.  The K-Town Bao Burgers were scrumptious and put together well.  The lamb chops is my go to here and I don't see that ending soon.  The carrot layer cake is unbelievable.  It's a tower of carrot cake, cream cheese filling paired with salted caramel ice cream.  Every appetizer I've sampled (Empenadas, Cuban Rope Vieja Tacos) has been nothing less of great, these are just my current favorites.  B & E Ambiance:  The facade is a pawn shop where you can actually purchase the items displayed.  You walk through the 'employee entrance' to get the lounge and the main dining area, totally cool speakeasy experience.  The beautiful chandeliers are set to a dim lighting for an intimate dining experience.  Picture frames showcasing mock jewelry throughout the dining area makes for a lovely setting.  The tables and chairs are high quality classy and the whole room gives me a Great Gatsby vibe.  Lots of fun.  The pricing is a premium but unlike many $$$ restaurants on the Strip, Beauty and Essex delivers.  The dishes are all high quality tasty and the service is top notch.   I'm on a mission to try all the toasts dishes (\"Jewels on Toast\") on their menu and I'll get there.  But that's another Yelp story, enjoy! =)",

Wait staff and cooks were good with any modifications needed to accomdate folks dietary preferences.  The drinks were good....I think. The vibe in here didn't feel like a lounge or too hip.  There was nothing here that didn't taste great. Definitely a solid menu. Whatever they cook they cook well.  Since there are two locations nyc and vegas.. I wanna reach out to those who been to the NYC. The pawn shop entrance feels more awesome at the NYC location...The vibe with the DJ and the amazing decor does not translate to this Vegas location..NYC is unforgettable   This is still pretty good :)  Anyhow enjoy the pics n videos n restaurant!",

We were seated in the main dining room which consists of booths around the perimeter and tables in the center of the dining room. We were seated next to a couple who was clearly in a food coma but telling us how they loved everything they ate and insisted we get the Mexican street corn ravioli. Ok we will!  Our server was a young lady who offered us water and cocktails to start. They have a craft cocktail menu that looked interesting but since it's Vegas, I was already 3 vodkas in before dinner so I passed on this part of the menu.  She explained that the menu is meant for sharing and for two of us we should go with 3 or 4 dishes. We started with the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings which were amazing. Little bites of grilled cheese sprinkled with bacon dust sitting in tomato soup.  We then had the Thai fried shrimp which were very good. Light and crisp, not greasy or heavily battered. Our neighbor table told us to get the bao burgers so we tried those as well. They were good but in hindsight I would have tried something different. And finally the ravioli which was something I am still thinking about - pasta filled with Mexican grilled corn and cojita cheese topped with a poblano cream sauce. OMG- SO delicious.  We were stuffed and had no room for dessert.   I will be back again. I would love to just come and sit in the lounge area here and have a few bites. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Had a reservation for 730 on a Monday, took about 15 minutes to get seated it was super loud and surprisingly busy in there. Its quite dark overall but they have a nice lounge and good looking bar. All the food is tapas size and they recommend 4-6 dishes per person which is absurd. Start with 3 per person and you can always order more.  Some of the highlights were the Mexican street corn ravioli, Thai lettuce wraps, grilled cheese dumplings, and Smores dessert - all are a must get in my opinion.  Some of the not so highlights were the bone marrow and the cuban tacos. Bone marrow was very buttery and the marmalade didn't completely help. Cuban tacos were very bland and uninspired.  Overall they had some good dishes but not enough memorable ones.  3.5/5",

When you walk through the door one is waiting for the ropes to part and the red carpet to roll out. The staff is so friendly and helpful with the menu . I decided to go healthy since I will be indulging in dessert.   I ordered the apple and kale salad and was so good that I almost forgot that I was eating something healthy. I also at the servers advise ordered it with pancetta which was so tasty. And red wine is so divine I know now why it is 45 a glass. I also wanted to stay hydrated and they kept refilling our water glasses four times and we did not even have to ask.   This restaurant is so very upscale and has great service and the best wait staff have had the honor to be the customer of that I would revisit another time. When it was time for check out it is like they can read minds or body language since they bring the check without even a signal from us mentioning anything",

It is the epitome of eclectic - you walk through a pawn shop to get to the restaurant - SO FREAKING COOL. This time we started with a drink at the bar, which was fun, as it is completely separate from the restaurant, so a different experience than the dining room.  The dining room is dark and full of funky items on the wall, nice leather half-booths make it cozy - the room is full of energy so not the place for a quiet romantic evening, but that is the charm of Beauty & Essex.  It is a tapas-style menu, but they also have entree items - we prefer the tapas vibe. We always order the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings - SO DELICIOUS. We also had the Chicken Meatballs, and the Asparagus & Proscuitto \"Jewels on Toast\" - the toast was actually nice thick pieces, I was expecting little \"crostini\", a nice surprise, and really tasty.  Service was good, the manager stopped by to check on us (and we recognized him from the first time we went to Beauty & Essex, right after they opened - he was our waiter, so it was great to see them promoting good people)  We always save a night for Beauty & Essex when we are in Vegas.",

The overall atmosphere and dining experience was 5 star: the decor was beautiful, the servers friendly and efficient, and of course the food was superb. And I don't use those words lightly! My friend and I split the empanadas, tuna poke tacos,  Mac & cheese, grilled cheese dumplings & tomato soup spoons, and the chicken meatballs. The standouts were the tuna tacos and meatballs. omg the ricotta and truffle sauce, I'm still thinking about them 48 hours after. I also really appreciated that the waiter said upfront that a few dishes came with 3 pieces and asked if we wanted to have 4 pieces (yes there was an upcharge but it's better than trying to split a mini taco!). Like most small plates restaurants, the portions might feel small and the prices might seem high. So it's the kind of place that is great for 2 or 4 people, but not great for large groups.",

I think the best dish es they have are the shishito peppers and the avocado toast. Sometimes simple is better and a lot of the things on the menu are very complicated in terms of ingredients and don't really equate to much in the flavor category. It is pretty pricey but it is a great place to bring a couple of friends to grab drinks and share some food. All the plates and designed to be shared. The drinks are very good as well but I would recommend drinking at home and getting a ride there and having one drink for the best experience. The atmosphere is nice and dark and the service is very good.",

We went to cosmo to take my 13yr to a concert but had arrived much earlier than anticipated so decided to look around and find a good place to eat. All other restaurants have menus out with pricing but B&E only had menus out without pricing. Sorry but I like to see how much I'm going to pay before getting surprised at the table.  My wife and daughter were dressed very nicely even though I wasn't in a suit, I still didn't look like a bum.  Walked in asked for a menu. Hostess A said they were inside.  I asked her if I could get one. She said no cause we couldn't go in yet. I then asked if she could get us one. She looked lost at that request. Hostess B then said we couldn't go in yet cause they werent ready to open. I said I didn't want to go in just wanted to look at a menu, if she could go and grab one. They both looked at each other and final B said to A, \"just go grab one\".  A came back and gave the menu to my daughter. While looking at the menu B said \"do you guys even have reservations?\" I told them at this point we were just looking to see what we want to eat.  She said \"well, you should really think about reservations cause we don't know if we will be able to seat you at this time or the time you want, so you might want to call and do that\".   I get that we might have needed reservations and know if they are busy or full we might not be able to get a table. But the snotty way she was talking to us like if she was there to do us a favor.  This place isn't a vegas nightclub but the hostess already have the \"better than you\" attitude.  Plus it was a Thursday night at 5pm!!   Oh well we ended up at scarpetta's spending close to $300.  Won't be back to this place if this is how the front of the house is. Just imagine how much of a bother you must be to the serving staff.",

Each time I was impressed by the service, the ambiance, the decor, and the food itself!  I've tried a good portion of their food now; ranking below are in terms of food taste!  1. GARGANELLI  - Just pure amazing! Loved the taste, I ended up ordering this for myself the next time I came here! It was just perfection  2. KALE & APPLE SALAD  - One of the best salads I've ever had! - Perfect blend of dry cheese, kale, apple, and nuts!  3. TOMATO & CREAMY BURRATA - Must try for an appetizer!  - Perfect mix of toast/bread with Burrata cheese!  4. GRILLED ATLANTIC SALMON  - Came with 3 pieces of salmon - Great presentation - The salmon tasted really good! - The couscous and the other sides/sauces complimented the salmon really well  5. THAI STYLE DEEP-FRIED SHRIMP  - Great if you love shrimp  6. SPAGHETTINI  - Generous portion (for a tapas style) - Tasted very unique and different - Good try once, but will not get it again  Below are the food which were very average:   K-TOWN BAO BURGERS - Tasted very average, nothing special  THIN CRUST GOAT CHEESE PIZZETTA - Very average thin crust pizza  MEXICAN STREET CORN RAVIOLI - Some people loved it, I thought it was okay  Food not to get:  14 OZ. PRIME DRY-AGED SIRLOIN - Worst thing  I tasted on the menu - Would avoid",

I ended up getting there early so I sat in the lounge area, with one of the girls I was meeting, off to the side of the bar. Dim lighting, moody feels, good vibes throughout the area. As we waited the service was great, the waitress were very attentive. Once our whole party arrived, they took us down the hallway into the dining area. We got a corner booth, plenty of room. However it was very noisy for it being in a smaller place to eat.   Most of us ordered the pasta pesto with shrimp, a flat bread and the mac n cheese. For dessert the s'mores cake and butterscotch pudding. All the food was very tasty, fresh and well made. Presentation of the food was perfect to for it being a higher end restaurant. It is a bit expensive but if you plan to share it's worth the price points, along with the quality of the food.    Great customer service. Overall a wonderful experience. Just note that when you walk in it's like a pawn shop.. go through the door and the vibe completely changes !! A must try for a new underground high end restaurant.",

Our dinner turned out to be terrible, and the concierge recommended this place for dessert. No joke, we ordered 5 plates of dessert. List in order of my favorite to least favorite.    KYGO Cloud Nine S'mores: Most highly recommended dessert, and I understand why! Tons of flavor and a variety of textures - chocolately, soft, crunchy, gooey. Highly recommend a glass of milk with this!   Devil's Food Layer Cake: Rich balance of chocolate and vanilla.   Strawberry Shortcake Bars: Frozen cheesecake covered in fresh strawberries, covered in captain crunch pieces. It was like an adult version of a strawberry shortcake ice cream pop that you got off the ice cream truck!   NYC Doughnuts: lightly fried covered in cinnamon and sugar. I'm personally not a big donut fan, but my friends loved it!   Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme: Served with two cookies, and the pudding wasn't overly rich and has a subtle hint of coconut. Highly recommend if you're a butterscotch fan.   Also, first place I saw in Vegas with a \"Virgin Cocktails\" menu. I like that the restaurant was able to appeal to everyone.",

Theres a ton to chose from on the menu. We chose the Pre-fixe menu. For $75 a person there was about 20 menu items to chose from. It was nice because they were basically small plates and they came out on perfect timing. The food was decent, but we did send the filet back due to extreme saltiness. I enjoyed the food much more at Santos sister restaurant - Vandal in NYC. We also ordered 2 crafted cocktails - a rose and gin cocktail, and Bourbon- that were priced a bit steep ($17) but delish!   The waitress and bus staff were really amazing!  I enjoyed the ambience and hip vibe of the restaraunt",

I tried: -poke tacos  -empanadas  -Thai style shrimp -steak tartare -mac n cheese -donuts (for dessert, comes with chocolate, raspberry, and caramel sauce)  Total bill was around $120 for these small tapa style plates among 4 girls.

When you first see it you think it's some type of expensive pawn shop or something. But then you walk through the door into this really trendy lounge/ bar area where you can get drinks while you wait for your table. I'm glad we had reservations cuz this place was packed. Reservations are a must. It was busy all night.  So we get to our table and are greeted by our server who was pretty awesome. She made great recommendations and was spot on. I wish I could remember her name, I know it started with an R and she looked some type of Pacific Islander maybe, very pretty. Anyway she made our night a good one and I'm thankful for that.   The food is all shareable which is nice so everyone can try everybody's dish. We ate so much I couldn't save room for dessert. But they did bring out some happy birthday chocolate cake pops that were really good, and I don't even like cake pops;)",

I'd been wanting to try Beauty & Essex after my excellent experience at The Stanton Social a couple months ago so I figured it would be a nice spot for my girls and I to have our last dinner in Vegas at. I made a 10pm reservation because it was the only time available so I would recommend making reservations as far in advance as possible. The host was very friendly and we had to wait about 10 minutes before our table was ready which was fine, we were told there was complimentary champagne in the pawn shop if we were interested. Once seated our waitress came over and explained the menu and the recommended amount of dishes we should order based on our party size. There were 3 of us and the recommendation was 6-8 dishes, having been to The Stanton Social previously I felt like that was way too many dishes so we started off with 3 - chorizo mac and cheese, ropa vieja tacos, and the grilled cheese & tomato soup dumplings. My dinner companions were initially skeptical having never had tapas before they were quickly convinced that this was the right choice  because everything had so much flavor and was finger licking good. After we finished the 3 dishes we decided to order a larger dish from their \"entree\" section and another side- we went with the pork chop and onion rings. The pork chop was incredibly flavorful. We concluded our meal with the doughnuts of course- soooo delicious. Our waitress was incredibly kind and attentive and informative, she was consistently checking in to make sure we were ok  had such a pleasant demeanor, I wish I could remember her name to shout her out. Also, my friends and I had no trouble communicating over the music, it was definitely not blaring by any means. I love the vibe of the hip hop music against the swanky dark interior and yummy food, it's certainly a fun, tasty, memorable dining experience. I will be trying the NYC location soon.",

It appears to be a jewelry store but upon closer inspection glancing at the writing on the walls we found out that this is a bar and restaurant establishment.  When you come up on the establishment their is a round section that looks like a little Lounge area with ladies at a jewelry counter which in fact is the waiting area for the restaurant.  Ladies enjoy a glass of complimentary Prosecco!  The menu prices are better than most of the places in the Cosmopolitan!   These tapas like type of dishes are paired for two people to eat from so all you need are really two or three dishes.  The selection of adult beverages are phenomenal.   I had a VIP tour from Alec. He showed me around and showed me the Vault where there is a pricey looking (faux) necklace and room filled with mirrors.  Their is an exclusive provate room w 2 Crystal Swarovski UFO chandeliers where celebrities host dinner parties like Kevin Hart, Kardashian's, award show after functions, etc!  On Monday Knights, Alec mentioned to me it is called lingerie night starting at 9:30 p.m.    The Tao Group has various models that walkthrough the dining area along with secret agent (trench coated tall supermodels who model jewelry lingerie).    I had to return the car to the airport and catch my flight so I was unable to stay for another hour and a half to catch the show.  There were 6 tables of (10 men) each who filled up the dining area!!  I don't think they wanted to buy any jewelry nor lingerie to take back home to their wives or fiance's!   All in all..... this place is fabulous and I would suggest everyone who is visiting Las Vegas to check this classy area out.   They have in the jewelry cases really Nifty types of jewelry and exclusive items like a pair of Diamond Guitar earrings Crystal bracelets and watches, classic guitars, and celebrity dolls!",

The food was okay, I thought it was overpriced, it was dark and honestly just way too loud (typical for Vegas, but I just wasn't a huge fan). We ordered the tuna poke wonton tacos, dry aged chuck sliders, ratatoille, roasted brussel sprouts, french onion dumplings, and grilled cheese soup dumplings. The food was okay, nothing was terrible and nothing was mind-blowingly amazing. I just couldn't get over how loud and dark it was inside. We were also seated at a super long table in the middle so you could only really talk to the 2-3 people closest to you, and it was a little difficult to move around to mingle with the other diners at our table. I wish I could give it a 3 1/2. It's not really a 3. but it's not a 4, so I'll round down.  I'd come back if I had to, but Vegas has too many good restaurants to waste an opportunity to eat like a queen.",

We did sample a bit of everything (avoid the west/east oysters as they are disappointingly small) including their signature cocktails which were more ice than signature.  The dining rooms were cramped and the design is not conducive to civil conversation. Even the servers complained if the noise levels and mentioned it only gets worse when the music starts playing.  There are too many other options in Vegas with better surroundings, food and pricing. Won't be back.",

Was rather confused when we first walked in, you walk in what looks like a guitar shop, but are greeted by a door man for the restaurant. The decor was very electric and felt on trend. I got the Emerald Gimlet after our server suggested it and it was so good!  For our meal, we had a little bit of everything... I was torn between the Steak Tartare and the Tomato Tartare but our server suggested the tomato and she was so right, the perfect balance and really a great amuse bouche. Of course we got the French Onion Soup Dumplings (what we came for) and the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon &Tomato Soup. They did not disappoint on taste. We also ordered the Roasted Mushroom Pizzetta and the Caesar Toast. One of the best Caesar salads I've ever had.  Definitely a great place to try when in Vegas. Cannot wait till the LA location opens later in the year!",

Our server was very nice and helpful, and always stopping by.    One tip...do not come here for a private, romantic dinner date.  This place is LOUD and busy, so know what you are getting into.

I personally have dietary restriction, no dairy, no wheat, no glutton and no fish. Not only did he recommend the most perfect items for us he personally brought me each item prepared with my dietary restrictions adhered to. I'm kind of over the top impressed and want to highjack him to join our team! We had 9 our party & everyone was exceptionally pleased. Ian, I hope you read this you are without a doubt the best.

As you walk in, you are immediately immersed in the vibe. The bartenders smile at you, everything about this place is inviting. It's nice when everyone is welcoming and not just the one person seating you, or serving you. Makes a HUGE difference.  Third star for the FOOD,  dishes nothing short of tastebud nirvana. We had the lobster rolls, which were a mixture of lobster nestled inside of a miniature sweet potato roll.  Ahhhhhmazing. We had the scallops, and okay my husband doesn't even eat scallops and LOVED them. I had the Mediterranean salad, beautiful presentation and simply perfect. We had the short rib Mac & cheese, a little too heavy for us, but delicious nevertheless. We also had shrimp cocktail, nothing much about shrimp cocktail as you know, however their cocktail sauce was delicious.  FOURTH AND FIFTH star for David H, our server. Who was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but extremely helpful and patient while we decided what to pick of all the fantastic choices. Obviously 2 people can only eat so much food, so we wanted to choose 5 items to share. He was extremely helpful and pleasant.  There is nothing greater than experiencing fine food, in a luxurious atmosphere with an amazing server. So thank you David H. for providing us with an amazing experience. We will be back!",

Servers and diners had to practically scream at each other.  Made it really hard to enjoy dinner and Conversation with our friends.   Food came out fast, but anything that was supposed to be hot came out cold.  Everything was just average no great standouts.  One pasta dough was so cold it was inedible and they removed from our check, no questions asked.  Not a great dining experience.. couldn't wait to leave.  Wish it was better!

The pawn shop entry is a nice touch but I would have liked to have seen a bit of a challenge to gain entry. Something like find the Moonstone broach and it has the password written on the price tag.   When you enter the place is dark and elegant. Definitely hits that speakeasy vibe. We had a drink at the bar before being seated. It was comfortable and prompt even for a busy night. I had the Emerald Gimlet which was herbal and refreshing.   We were seated in a mafia booth in the back of the dining room. We couldn't have asked for a better spot. It was private while being completely in the energetic vibe of the place. Our waiter was the bomb! He walked us through the menu and made some fantastic suggestions.   We started with the Yellowtail. A mainstay dish but their take was unique and delicious. The fish was fresh and perfect. The pickled jalapeno was a nice departure.  Next up was the tuna poke tacos. They sounded tasty but I had seen similar items at many other restaurants, so I wasn't expecting to be blown away. I was so wrong. They masterfully captured the essence of the Poke bowl and transfigured it into a Taco. It was bright and crisp and flavorful. It lit up my entire mouth. We next went for the Bao burgers at the recommendation of our server. They weren't on my radar, but he sold me. Wow! So different from the tacos but another knock out. Savory and decadent and simply dripping with umami complexity. The gochugang sauce and slaw were perfect contrasts to the heavy flavors. They rounded out the flavor rollercoaster delightfully. The fried bun was ridiculous. I think it is probably illegal outside of Vegas. Next up was the Chile Relleno Empanadas. I am a huge fan of both those dishes so I was excited to try them. Dear God in Heaven!!! I wanted to order 17 more plates of these and bathe in their glory. They were everything I wanted that combination to be and then some. Things were well into stride and we selected the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli. They absolutely could not have packed any more flavor into this dish. The roasted poblano creama was unbelievable. We licked this plate clean. For dessert we had the Black Bottom Butterscotch Pot du Creme. It was decadent. The deep chocolate balancing out the sweet. Then came the worst part of the evening. We were too full to order anything else. We very sadly had to part with the rest of the menu untasted.   This restaurant will be at the top of the list for our next visit to try the rest. This chef really has the magic touch when it comes to transcendent fusion.",

Overall phenomenal dining experience and I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I came to Beauty & Essex with a group (total of 6 people) and we had a reservation for 8.30pm on a Wednesday night. Despite the reservation, it took quite a long time to get seated (20-25 min), which was a little bit frustrating and definitely contributed to not achieving 5 stars.  Our server was great, very friendly and helped us to order just the right amount. The food was delicious and I would definitely recommend that you check it out. In a nutshell - It's a fun place, great atmosphere, great food and friendly service.  Here are my thoughts on the foods we shared: - TUNA POKE WONTON TACOS: very tasty (4/5) - YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI: delicious (5/5) - TOMATO TARTARE: not bad but probably my least favorite (3/5) - AVOCADO, LEMON & ESPELETTE: very good, lots of avocoado and the toast had a nice crunch (4/5) - ROASTED BONE MARROW: So good. Try it. I love bone marrow (5/5) - WILD MUSHROOM SALAD: Positively surprised how good it was. Would recommend (5/5) - GRILLED CHEESE, SMOKED BACON & TOMATO SOUP DUMPLINGS: Yummy (4/5) - MEDITERRANEAN CAULIFLOWER: Good but nothing special (3/5) - MEXICAN STREET CORN RAVIOLI: Very tasty but very rich, good to share (4/5) - GRILLED DOUBLE CUT LAMB CHOPS: Amazing. Would recommend (5/5) - CARROT LAYER CAKE: Super tasty (5/5) - SELECTION OF ICE CREAMS: Delicious, loved the coconut ice cream. (4/5)",

You enter the restaurant by first going through a really high-end jewelry store, it then gets dark and intimate inside the dining areas; I really enjoyed the lighting, chandeliers and complimentary champagne while you await your table.    The food is good, like really high-end tapas; however they ask you to order everything at one time for the whole table. We were there on a Friday night, for a friend's birthday- we were literally yelling to talk to each other and our server.  Our bill was around $600 w/o tip, not awful for 6 of us but 1 is vegan/no drinks and two hardly ate.  The dinner is a longer process because the tapas come out at different times (they are shareable, we had a lot of food at the table and some left-overs.  THE ISSUE: There was a restaurant host who had mentioned (several times throughout our dinner) getting us a comp. table at Marquee Night Club. When the club host FINALLY shows up and asks how he can help, my friend says \"well it's my friend's birthday and we were told maybe we could get a table\", he literally says \"I don't give a fuck\"!! I am not sure why he said it, maybe he was intimidated and/or joking..Either way totally inappropriate to say to any ladies and my friend went off, a glass was broken and I called the restaurant manager over to diffuse the situation.     I don't want to blame B&E for the entire situation going south, the restaurant is neat..maybe I am just getting to old for all the hype of a club-style dinner.",

Like, I'd need an ax pick to get that food out. Other than that, I would honestly say the location in LA was monumentally better. There are better tapas places on the strip but this place is okay too. For the money I'd rather go where the tapas are the very best. Is rather have the better food over a cool looking restaurant.",

Again, everything in the Cosmo is undercover... what looks like a fancy little pawn shop is actually a restaurant hiding behind a secret door...   I LOVE the picture frames with necklaces in them. Wish I had a pix, again too dark. But I really loved that look.   Our server was amazing... we came in with 2 kids (awful ppl I know, we were the only ones with kids there) but they didn't look down to us or make us feel unwelcome. They didn't have any coloring, which my kid was in desperate need of something after a long day of roaming the strip... server brought paper and pen to keep my kid happy!   We ended up going with the fancy 40 day aged steak to share... and it was the best steak we've ever had... so flavorful. Perfectly cooked. Sauces were remarkable.   Mac n cheese was slightly disappointing BUT only cause of the type of pasta, it was just too much pasta not enough sauce. Highly suggest a smaller pasta. It was rigatoni I think?  I had recently seen the French onion soup dumplings on some random video floating around the internet which brought me here... I was very disappointed they took it off the menu... but glad I still ate here. It's amazing, and I will be back!  And I guess it's a chain? Have to look more into that...",

The low light situation and close quarters gave this place a unique ambience.  We got a taste of the entire menu it seems like.   Started with the Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos to the Yellowtail Sashimi to the Pearls of the Sea coming in on an iced platter with an assortment of seafood.  The Bone Marrow was delicious with the toast. Best part? Do the Bone Marrow shot. Think of an ice luge, but you're using the Bone Marrow. Cool and different and delicious.  The Short Rib Mac & Cheese was delightful. The Onion Rings had a nice pop to them. The Chicken Meatballs were delectable.   What got me the most was the 14-oz Prime Dry-Aged Sirloin, medium rare of course. Delicious.  As for dessert, we got the Strawberry Shortcake Bars. Wow. THIS IS A MUST GET FOR DESSERT. Doesn't matter if you're full. Got a taste of some other desserts as well, but the Strawberry Shortcake Bars stole the show to end our meal.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a nice meal and try out a bunch of stuff.

The few good things are their waitstaff and the food  (THE VERY LITTLE WE RECEIVED). I had a party of 13 men for my brothers bachelor party and they had us do a \"fixed\" menu for $85 each. Needless to say we each had the following....  1) 1/2 inch taco 2) piece of bread 3) spoon of tomato soup 4) 1 shrimp 5) 3oz of pasta 6) 2 small slices of fillet 7) fries 8) a doughnut ball  Now, remember this is for each of us. We are probably more hungry now than when we came in.  Yes, they offered to give us one more round of the pasta, fries and steak but I never saw it come out and they insisted it came out. I would have rather ate at Burger King.  In the end, it takes a lot for me to bash a company but I will not be returning here and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.  Don't make the same mistake I made. Go eat anywhere else.",

Felt like I was drinking a green juice.)  - Pink Panther (The peppercorn syrup and lemon just didn't taste good to me.)  - Beauty Elixir (Refreshing. Would order.)  - Earl the Pearl (Perfect for me. I ordered two.)  - Bubbles & Berries (Also refreshing. Would order.)  We also ordered several small plates (multiples of some):   - Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (WOW. I could probably demolish three orders of these. The tuna was so fresh and the tacos were so crispy. They're so good and would definitely order again.)  - Pearls of the Sea (Beautifully presented and quite a bit of food. Everything was fresh and delicious. Would order again.)  - Roasted bone marrow (I love bone marrow, but it's always tricky ordering it to share when your party has first-time marrow eaters. Not an easy plate to split, so we ordered a second. So rich and buttery that I'd certainly order it again.)  - Grilled cheese, smoked bacon, & tomato soup dumplings (I was highly skeptical when we ordered this, but I became a True believer once I tried it. I can't believe how flavorful the dumplings were and that they were able to put all the flavors into a little dumpling but keep each one distinct. You weren't having a mix of grilled cheese and tomato soup flavors--you were having each distinct flavor plus smoked bacon in one dumpling. Would order again for the taste explosion.)  - Oven braised chicken meatballs (Solid and delicious. Juicy and tender and worth ordering again, though it's pretty hard to mess up meatballs at this level of restaurant, so it's almost average compared to other dishes.)  - Chile relleno empanadas (A delicious counterpoint to our other orders. I don't know if I'd order it again because there were so many other interesting items on the menu, but it's worth having at least once.)  Service was excellent, and it helps if you come in a group of reasonable size--smaller is better. The venue is dimly lit and the background noise from other tables can be overpowering. We were at a four-top and I had to strain to hear my friend sitting across from me. I don't recommend this place for large groups, especially large groups of hungry people. It's a tapas-style restaurant, so unless you'll fill up fast, you might have to spend a lot to eat a lot.",

Their was three of us and we shared five dishes along with two desserts (we couldn't decide they all sounded amazing) Its served tapas style and at first I didn't think it would be enough but we were overly satisfied with the dishes and the portions were perfect to try a variety. Of the dishes we tried the Mexican corn ravioli was my favorite, as well as the platinum peacock mocktail.",

The whole table ordered the Chef's selection menu which makes it easier since everything is TAPAS style. The food just kept coming and coming.  Our menu comprised of: Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche  Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos  Greek Toast Kale & Apple Salad Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings Thai Style Deep-Fried Shrimp Short Rib 'Mac & Cheese' BBQ Fries Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs Paprika Spiced Salmon  34 oz. 40-Day Dry-Aged Tomahawk Ribeye Everything was delicious but my favorite was ofcourse the Dumpling, kale salad,  Ribeye and Shrimp. The vibe in this resto is loud, fun  and dark so if you're having a work meeting this place is NOT the right place to have it. BUT if you want to just have a fun dinner, this is the place to be. The women get free champagne if you love champs. This place is definitely a good resto for ladies night, bachelorette dinners or good friends hanging out. Would definitely come back and try other TAPAS here.",

    "text": "Hubby and I had our dinner here this past Friday and it was a night to remember.  For me, in particular, since I had three virgin cocktails, Garnet Gimlet (I should have had this over ice), Platinum Peacock (my fave, very refreshing), and Ruby Iced Tea (tart).  Hubby was a bit over-buzzed after The Woodson, Goose IPA, and the Garrison.    Ranking from Most to Least Favorites: 1. Elote Style Scallops: Scallops were perfectly cooked on top of charred elote.  Delicous! 2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Creme: Just the right amount of richness.  Ooh, a piece of heaven with this dessert.  The ganache at the bottom adds a different texture to this elevated pot de creme.  Came with a spoon shaped thin cookie wafer.  A must order dessert. 3. Hand Cut Steak Tartare: The steak tartare was on top of crispy sticky rice cakes.  This was quite unique and flavorful. 4. East and West Coast Oysters: Ordered the dozen and got to try all fresh raw oysters.  Very satisfying. 5. Roasted Bone Marrow: Spread the marrow on some grilled toast, then topped with coarse salt and shallots marmalade...Yum! 6. Yellowtail Sashimi: Latin spin on this plate.  The sashimi was topped with pickled jalapeno and the ponzu sauce gave it some acidity.  I had to really try hard to taste the fish, but the flavor profile was there. 7. Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumpling: I liked this rendition.  The dumpling was nice and chewy.   8. Caesar Toast: Exactly that, except there are pieces of crispy chicken skin.  It delivered, yet, I wasn't satisfied. 9. Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche: When I think of Ceviche, I think of lime cured salmon.  This plate was just sweet.  It was missing the acidity that I am accustomed to, as well as salt.  A miss for me. 10. Kygo Cloud 9 S'Mores: WAY TOO RICH!  Need a glass of milk with this.  Overly sweet too.  Bleh!    I must say that the dishes are pretty pricey for the quantity and quality offered, but I believe guests are paying for the location and ambiance.  Service was fantastic!",

We were led to our seats after only a few sips at the bar. My melon mojito was on point, the bartender was quick and friendly. The interior of the restaurant is warm, 30s-50's style, night cocktail chic, and slightly boudoir feeling in a very subtle way. Business and young professional type diners.   The young woman who served our table was prompt and knowledgeable. She recommended a great oaky white whine that I kind of loved. Our tapas starter, the steak tartare and salmon ceviche were a 3.5 out of 5 for me. The lobster elote was an absolute 5 as the lobster was done perfect. I had the lamb chops with Brussels Sprouts as a side. As a whole, 4.5. I'm sad that I had to leave a whole chop and most of my sprouts behind to catch the flight home.",

    "text": "I was referred to Beauty and Essex from a friend in the hospitality industry as a \"got to go\" while in Vegas, so my girlfriend and I had made reservations.  Approaching the main entrance it would appear you are walking into a pawn shop as there are an assortment of guitars and other un-related trinkets that are actually for sale.  We were then directed to the entrance of the restaurant as we had advised the person in the front we had reservations to dine. The initial appearance brought me to a speak-easy style establishment in NYC.  The overall decor and detail of the surroundings definitely made it a great place to have an intimate dining experience with a loved one and or friends.  The wait staff was so cordial and courteous.  We had the pleasure of dining with Kaitlin who was extremely attentive, as well as the rest of the staff who worked together as a team to ensure we had a positive experience.    For drinks I had their emerald gimlet which was delicious.  I then had to try their oaxacan old fashioned as I have never had one containing mezcal - wow!  My girlfriend had the bubbles and berries which she really enjoyed as well.  We also tried several appetizers, all unique in their presentation and flavor - my favorite being the pulled chicken arepas.  We also really enjoyed the tuna tacos as well as the the grilled cheese and bacon tomato soup dumplings which were surprisingly tasty.  We also had an order of the empanadas which were my least favorite of the bunch.  For the main course we shared the elote scallops and the short rib mac and cheese - together they made a combo!  Would highly recommend!!!",

So when I saw that they were opening one up in Las Vegas I had to come check it out and being that I visit frequent Vegas often it was gonna happen finally.   So it's set up is definitely great. I like the flow of the space. Eye catching things/decor all around.   Music sets the vibe at a perfect sound level.   The food is good. We (my party) ordered several things off the menu. The Lamb was by far the best thing we ordered. It was soooo good.  The empanadas that we had were a little cold & so was the dumpling soup. If that wouldn't of happened it definitely would of been 5 stars.   Service was great as well.  I'll definitely be back.",

I'm glad we chose this place. The atmosphere was exactly what we were looking for (dimly lit, not too noisy, just the right amount of nightlife). The only minor complaint I had was that the service was a bit slow (but to be fair, it was pretty crowded that night, so I couldn't blame them). The food and drinks were great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and there was nothing I wouldn't recommend. A must try!",

Felt like a secret adventure...the bar and restaurant were decorated well, empty frames with necklaces dangling in them divided the rooms from the hallway.  Great waitress, but the servers bringing the food seemed not happy to be there.  Granted it was a Thursday night and about to get busy but that's what you sign up for if  you are working a restaurant on the strip.  Food was OK, tomato soup and grilled cheese was cute but just ok, salmon ceviche was ok but nothing notable, lobster roll was a tad salty, small pieces of lobster and I did not like the roll...onion rings were a bright spot, hot and crunchy,  the way they should be. Scallops were also good, had some heat but again a little on the salty side.  Cool vibe but I'd only recommend a drink and the onion rings just to see the inside of the restaurant.",

Very rude to say the least.   Our waitress made up for her rudeness. Probably one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was attentive and made several recommendations. We decided on meatballs, beauty and Essex burger and the tomato dumplings. The plates were well proportioned and full of flavor.   I read a couple of reviews stating the restaurant was loud, we sat in the back and the noise level was just fine. As we were walking out the dining room closer to the bar was louder, in case that's what you're after. I'll definitely return with the girls next time!",
