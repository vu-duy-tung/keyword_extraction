A variety of banchan at the table from kimchi, kimchi cucumbers, mashed potatoes & pickled radish.  They bring you rice, salad & japchae.  Rufio & Jason were our main wait staff, who were AMAZING.  Thanks for suggesting the flat iron brisket, it was delicious & full of flavor! Plenty of FRIENDLY & quick support staff on hand bringing food, making sure we had our water filled, grill changed & everything in between.  Keep up the exceptional service.  Currently no bar service (pending liquor license) but plenty of non alcoholic drinks to choose from.  Looking forward to our next visit when we are back in town.",

The lighting gives it this cool retro look. Food was amazing, but what really won my attention was the service. We were first greeted with a warm welcome by the hostesses, I believe her name was Kaley. Once we were sat, our server Criza did a phenomenal job with making my first experience here memorable. She gave me the best recommendations. The beef tongue, as strange as it sounds, was my favorite item on the menu. Criza catered to our every need! Whether it came to drink refills or making sure we got all our orders. Outstanding job Gen! If you ever dine in there, ask for Criza, you'll be in for a treat!!",

After asking him politely if he could please put the flame back up for us he turned his back on us without saying anything. He came back with a new grill and I said politely \"oh no thank you tho we just got that changed if you can just please turn the flame back on cause it turned off\". He replied rudely \"I already grabbed it so I'm gonna change it\" like he didn't have any patience, so I just said \"oh ok\". The when my boyfriend started putting the food on our grill, he said \" Dude wait for the grill a little bit\" when my boyfriend said its ok he replied \"I'm just saying bro\" and started slamming some of the plates on the table. We spoke to the manager after paying for our bill and I wasn't sure what happened after. Now I'll think twice about coming back here again if I see that server still serving at tables again.",

I recommend the Gen Signature Galbi. The meat and the marinate just taste perfectly savory on the grill. The Premium Pork Belly is amazing as well. Very little seasoning but packs a lot of flavor. Their drinks were really good. My table got a Strawberry Soju Cocktail and a Lychee/Peach Soju Cocktail and they were both really tasty and their sweetness complemented the saltiness of the meats. They also had a bar, which was amazing with their wines and hard liquors. The service was also very excellent. Our server, Jan, was very helpful and attentive and he had a wonderful energy. I really, really wanted to give the place five stars. But the location had problems I couldnt ignore. One is their ventilation. With KBBQ places, one would expect smoke. But the building had poor ventilation that as soon as you walk in, the whole place was so smoky it looked like a fog machine was on. The place also had a lounge/club type of feel, which is not a bad thing. But the music was so loud, it was hard to hear anything. Granted, they played really good music. But instead of background sounds, the place just had a club feel to it which was off. Other than that, I'm really glad that there is a Gen on the westside now and its definitely worth a trip back.",

Our dinner was fun, exciting and yes undeniably delicious!!!  I have passed this restaurant several times but finally decided to try this restaurant when \"Herbs and Rye\" (down the street) messed up on our reservation. After not being accommodated at \"Herbs and Rye\" everyone in my group was hungry and no one wanted to have to wait a long period of time to be seated. I called Gen prior to showing up and was told that the wait would only be 10 minutes. We rushed over with grumbling stomaches and a big appetite.  When I first walked in I was amazed of how \"cool\" it looked inside. I've never seen an AYCE that looked like this. With its cool \"club-like\" lighting and hip ambiance it definitely stands out when comparing to any other kbbq places around town.  We were greeted by the hostess immediately and was seated (less than 10 minutes like what was said over the phone). Our beautiful waitress came over promptly, introduced herself and gave us the warmest welcome. Criza's bubbly personality, knowledge of the menu and her promptness of taking orders definitely made our experience wonderful. Criza did not hesitate to give her knowledgeable input of what to order and cooking techniques. It is rare to get service like hers around town!  We will definitely be returning to eat here again as this visit earned getting my #1 spot for favorite kbbq spot around town and I will definitely be requesting Criza as our waitress!",

Very modern, clean, and comfortable.  For the AYCE dinner, it's $21.99 a person.  And I believe there is 39 options of raw meats (some marinated and others not) and already cooked appetizers.   The selection for the most part is very good.  I was wishing they had skirt steak but they have lots of other choices.  They have a few varieties of pork belly, chicken, cuts of beef as well as calamari and shrimp.    I've been to a few different Korean BBQ AYCE places and don't usually see the seafood selection this place had.    The only big knock on Gen was the quality of meats.   Most of the items we tried were chewy and not the quality levels I'm used to at a Korean BBQ place.   And we weren't a fan of most of the marinades when the meat was pre-marinated.     My favorite item was the KFC.   Also thought the spare ribs were pretty good.     Considering most of the people there are grilling their food, the ventilation seemed quality because it wasn't very smokey at all.     Servers are very attentive, helpful, and nice.   Restaurant is really well done and on a Saturday at 7PM, we only waited like 3 minutes to sit.   Everyone else seemed to like the food here a bit more then me so you should probably give it a try for yourself.",

This is definitely the best spot i've tried, their food is fresh, the kimchee is awesome, and the service is hard to believe. They had 4 people running around, getting whatever I wanted, super quick. My server (Jade) explained the menu and gave great reccomendations. The lunch menu has 32 items, I particularly loved the premium steak (which is an actual 1 inch thick sirloin steak) and the brisket. This place is definitely my go to Korean BBQ from now on.",

I stop going to the one in Henderson cuz #10 galbi is label on the menu but it's NOT galbi, its chewy and w tendon beef which they claim it's galbi(I know my meat) .  When I saw on Yelp that the new location have it cuz they just open and was excited to try it, BUT was disappointed  in the quality of the meat, omg it lack flavors and was sooo chewy..  I love marinated meats and all their meat lack in flavors..  Appetizers are very limited now, not like before.. NOT planning on coming here again, I'm going to stick to my new love  8ounce kbbq",

    "text": "Came here on a Tuesday evening with my parents after i got off work late. I heard about this location a few months ago but for some odd reason, it took them a few months to open. Maybe inspections and renovations stuff? Dunoe !   Anyway, this is located on the SW corner of Sahara and Decatur, in the same center as where Circuit City used to be (ahh millennials will not know what this was... XD fyi my definition of millennials is those born after 2000). It took over this standalone building that used to be some buffet (never been...)  Renovations are somewhat similar to the Henderson location but without the high ceilings and more seating (or so it seemed).   My parents were already seated by the time i arrived and had some food ordered. I arrived and started cooking (sad face i still had to cook after working 11 hrs... zZzZz)   Customer service for this location was pretty on point (for now...). I got my drink order almost as soon as i sat down and had people asking if i wanted to order more stuff repeatedly pretty often.   Menu wise, seemed quite similar to the one in Henderson. The only thing i noticed a change to was the amount of beef tongue each order gives, and the \"premium steak\" was a sirloin steak. Iirc it was a NY strip or maybe even a rib eye at the other location but i havent been there in months. Not too much of an issue as i can start cooking on the fat cap, rendering it down then cooking it on the other sides.   Aside from beef tongue and premium steak, got pork neck/jowl (whatever they call it), brisket, spicy pork, pork belly, bulgolgi.. and a repeat of a few. XD They finally have sliced pickled radish here !   The weird thing i noticed was their salad used a \"spring\" salad instead of the usual romaine lettuce.   The ventilation is pretty bad. The ones without the hood above doesn't to suck as well (....ha...). I've seen the same type ventilate very well to point you saw the smoke curling in but this did not have this affect at all. I feel bad for whoever has to clean those glass walls daily... I actually overheard a someone telling another that they are supposed to turn down the gas if it smokes .... (most annoying thing they do at kbbq's without ample ventilation. why can't they upgrade to the ones like in korea where you can bring it down while cooking?)",

The restaurant space is more spacious with way more seating. Went in on Sunday afternoon and we were seated right away. We had great service. Not once did we ever go, where is our server nor did we have to ask twice for anything to eat/drink. We ordered beef belly, brisket, beef tongue (for my bf), & kfc. I LOVE that their meats are perfectly sliced. Portion wise, they serve more each plate so I would start off ordering at least 3 plates at a time to avoid wasting. We definitely do appreciate clean chairs, tablets, and restaurants (even though it's new). Props to management for also helping the wait staff and for the wait staff doing a good job of tending to your tables. It really satisfied my Gen craving until next time!!",

One of the times they even remeasured her after dinner. It always comes down to something the manager said. I don't even bother arguing it but they should all be on the same page.",

The wait wasn't long, on a Saturday at 1130am, for 2 people. We were asked if we wanted lunch or dinner, we chose lunch. Our waitress kept forgetting to bring us sides when we asked twice. We asked another person on the third try, finally got them. Another waiter came to our table to tell us that today is only a dinner price day and we said that's not our fault the hostess asked us which price point. She SHOULD be trained well enough to know BEFORE she's put on the floor. We shouldn't be penalized for YOUR mistake. All the while, their \"manager\" is on the phone for what seems to be (what we've heard from customers and employees) a computer issue with their Point-Of-Sale system. He actually brings a check to a customers table and handles it and them in a manner that should not be present in a leadership position because that attitude trickles down the chain of command. If your boss doesn't give 2 sh*ts, why should you? Henderson treats you like a professional establishment should. Food tastes of same yummy quality at both, you'll feel better spending your money at Henderson. We'll make the drive. Sahara is closer to home fo, but not worth it. One male server was the only one who kept it professional with communication open about the computer issues and fixing the hostess' mistake. Thank you, G. You should work at Henderson lol.",

We ate dinner on 7/7 Our table was right in front of the bar and this Asian blond hair server was one of the most amazing server I've ever had. Always big smiling always taking care of us with our orders and needs. Just A+ customer service. Food was great, price was unbelievable.  But only KFC was not like Korean FC at all, more like sweet and sour chicken. But that's ok, the server was so nice we didn't care. We had most amazing time.

Sat afternoon, not that busy but c'mon, changing grills almost every 10 min is annoying, especially if you've still got food cooking and then have to transfer it to whatever free plate you can find so they can change it, because they're already standing there with one on hand. Imagine just taking some meat off, in mid chew so couldn't answer but had to nod when server asked if we could move the meat somewhere. Four pairs of chopsticks had to hurridly move meat. Sure, the service is fast but with so many different servers working at break neck speed, the lack of time between grill changes, being asked about another order, eating said order and just trying to enjoy the meal... Let's say it's chaotic at best. This is our second time here, First time was better.

I don't know if I spelled right, but she was the sweetest lady ever! Best customer service I've ever had, she filled our drinks without asking and even consistently checked on us even though it was quite busy! A plus experience, hope she's my waitress every time I go here.",

I've been to Gen about 5 times since it opened and it has the best service  and excellent quality of food.   It is all you can eat for 2 hours and has tasty hot food from the kitchen delivered which is nice to have while we cook your own meat. The staff always asks if we need anything and changes our grill top frequently.  We will absolutely be back at Gen time and time again!",

    "text": "Introduction: So while we were on our way to Cheesecake Factory, we saw this amazing Korean BBQ Gen.  Therefore, we decided to stop here instead of Cheesecake Factory. So excited that they put one here, WHOO HOO!  Customer Service: 5/5 So there's quite a few Gens in CA, their service is not quite as good in comparison to this one.  Which we stopped going. Everyone was on point at this location and our orders were served quite fast.  I hope they don't lose this awesome service when they get busier in the future.  That tends to happen after a business gets picked up, they lose their  loyalty to their customers that once bring them revenue to stay in business.  Price: 5/5 Omg! Finally a REAL Korean BBQ that belongs here. The Menu is outstanding with such an amazing price.  Most importantly, it's simple, in both pricings and categories.  I have a hard time locating a Korean BBQ restaurant here in Vegas that is buffet. And when they are, the meats are not AYCE or the Menu is annoyingly complicated.  With this pricing, you can only order this and/or that or, it's not a buffet. WTF? Super annoying well not at Gen, simple to the Max.   Atmosphere: 5/5 Gorgeous, cozy and Modern! I love the fact that the grill is kinda deep, therefore, you avoid the splashing. In addition, the ventilation is exceptional. I usually have to change after lunch from the one in CA. I did not have to do that here.   Quality: 5/5 One word OUTSTANDING! Everything was so freakin amazing, even the pre cooked items. I can not say that there's one item in the Menu I do not care for.  Everything we ordered were YUMMY!  Quantity: 5/5 A LOT, so much I could not walk afterwards.  They don't serve you those tiny little annoying small steam rice bowls that I always had to order two. Here, one is enough.  Every portion was super generous.    Tips to the Owner: Please ensure your TEAM don't lose their momentum, in both service and their attentiveness.  Right now, they are AMAZING, I will always be back and give you guys referrals if it stays like this.",

I usually drive 40 minutes to go to Henderson location, now i only drive 10 minutes to eat here at Gen bbq in Sahara. I say this place is a bit smaller in a older building.   Its very busy at this time when we came in. We were greeted and welcomed by the staff. They had us seated in about 5 minutes. The menu is the same just like the Henderson location. I always order the Brisket and the skirt steak. I also recommended getting the beef belly, its a different type of meat than most places.   Thankfully they only give little portion just incase you dont finish it all. The quality of the meat is 8/10. The service is 9/10, they always check up on you. This place is gold for any special occasions with friends and family. They still working on their alcohol license, all in all i will come back to this awesome kbbq spot.",

When you walk into this place, you notice how open their seating is. We were seated 5 minutes after we arrived.   Food - They offered a lot of different menu items, from intestines to pork belly & spicy octopus. My table ordered pretty much one of everything. Some items lacked flavor but I'm very impressed to the different types of meat they offered. The salad was a no for me, tasted too much like grass. The sides were all very tasty. The kimchee radish & potato salad would be my favorites. The food came out VERY quick. I mean like 10 seconds after we ordered from our server. We got right to business and before you know it, we have 20 plates of different meats on our table.    Customer service - Our server Jeremiah gave us exceptional service!! He made our time here very pleasant. Although we were only a party of 5, my table made it feel like we were a party of 8 (we were honestly very needed) but he catered to all our needs.  Overall, I will return to this location again! I'm very pleased with the food and the service. I suggest anyone to try this place out for Korean bbq!",

The hawaiian style is a marinated meat such as beef, pork or chicken with a pineapple slice. Very tasty. They also now have actual Kalbi with the 3 bones on the side. My favorite is still the super tender beef tongue.   The quality is good for an AYCE. Service is fast, friendly, and your grill gets changed out regularly.   During dinner time it is pretty packed and popular so make sure you come ready for a waitlist.   Fyi this location is waiting on it's liquor license. Hopefully it will come soon as I can't wait to have their drinks.",

My favorite was the KFC which is a sweet and spicy fried chicken . The beef bulgogi was heaven , melt in your mouth -we had about four orders of that I'm also a huge fan of pork belly but next time I'll be adventurous and try the Cajun pork belly . The table comes with an array of sides. Edamame is always good but it was my first time having \"sweet\" mashed potatoes . There was also a green tea salt and pepper that was so good , I wanted a bottle to take home with me . All in all my family and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and service and I can't wait to return .",

The service is unmatched & the food is just simply beyond amazing. This gen offers japchae & gyozas as appetizers before your meats arrive. Like what! That's amazing. The japchae was another level of deliciousness.   Service- hostesses and waiters were on top of their game. They constantly checked if we needed more meat. The best part was how every plate was equally fresh and delicious as the first. Other gens give you lower quality meat as you eat more but this one maintains quality.   I highly recommend this place!

The head on shrimp and calamari was good also. we also had chicken and the thinly sliced beef and pork as well as pork belly, fresh veggies and mushrooms,  2 hour time limit... they changed our grill 3 times...  all the condiments were also a great compliment to the meal.  Too many choices to try it all, need to come back again.... especially for the premium steak.  They give you tongs and a scissors to to cut your meat, surprisingly works great, better than a knife and fork...  Ventilation great, not smokey like other places...  Lots of parking here.",

    "text": "Oh man, where should I start. My overall experience was not the best. I eat Korean barbecue pretty often and I've eaten at multiple places including their other location in Henderson. Good pricing, but would spend it elsewhere.  Place looks great on the outside and inside. Great parking space amount. Table set up was alright, just wish they looked at the items they bring out. Not that I really care, but might as well point out for someone with kids or something.   Customer Service from our main server (Neil) was alright. Came by to change our grill before we even needed to ask. Checked on our table only a few times over the course of our meal. Always needed to wait a bit to order more and by the time he came, our grill was already empty of food. However one of the food runners or other servers came to bring some food out with some attitude. I didn't get her name, but she had a tattoo on her right arm with the number 92 or something. She even looked me in the eye and rolled her eyes while saying \"I have brisket on this side as well, hold on let me put it together.\" Right in front of us. Usually you would do that so customers don't see, but I guess they don't care here.  Makes it seem like these meats are just frozen and thawed out for grabs when needed. I even had to bus some of my empty plates because no one would check up frequent enough to clear our space.   Anyways, lots of better places out there like 888, Hwaro, Hobak, Gangnam worth your money instead of this place.",

    "text": "The staff was helpful and willing to explain the way KBBQ works for me and my dad - since we were unfamiliar with the process. The food was delicious, the building was clean, parking wasn't a problem, and they had a good variety of options to choose from.   My only critique is that, closer to the end of the night, we were wanting to order a couple more items but we waited over an hour for our waiter to help us before we just decided to leave. Our waiter told us that he would be back to take our order but never returned. We saw him walking around but even after we made eye contact he didn't return. This may have been an isolated incidence because the rest of the staff was very kind, but I'll have to go there again before I can say whether or not they have good responsiveness and customer service.   A recommendation I would make for the restaurant is to invest some time into training employees on how to deal with customers who are trying KBBQ for the first time. We were told about a couple recommendations in the beginning, but there were a few missed opportunities to make a really good first impression. This is asking a lot, but that would have earned this place 5 stars instead of 4.",

It's super clean, and it's not that long of a wait.   Their premium steak is one that you should definitely order, along with the brisket. They give you pretty small portions, which gives you the opportunity to try more from their menu. They have a pretty wide range of meats to select from, but not many appetizers, in my opinion.   The only thing that sucks is that there's no dessert included like other KBBQ I've been to  They have ice cream macarons, which taste pretty good, but I don't think is worth the price. They had a good variety of flavors from vanilla to coffee though if you wanted to try!",

I rarely find a KBBQ place that exceeds my expectations but I really found that the 30+ menu items and the pricing here was actually really great. Start off with 3 items at a time, usually not something I would do but was recommended by the waitress and that became my routine throughout the night. I believe it works best because the service is a bit slow and I'm sure it's due to how busy the place is. It did however take me asking 3 different times for a part of my meal. And waiting about 10 mins for a pair of chopsticks to replace the one I dropped in the middle of my meal. Coming here just be mindful that the staff may not be as attentive as is standard in many restaurants due to the high occupancy the restaurant has at certain hours.  We got there for dinner in the mid week.",

Service was fantastic - we had multiple servers and they were all very nice and quick. We didn't have to wait for meat or banchan more than a minute or two and getting our grill changed was a breeze. All the food was fresh. I was a big fan of the spicy pork bulgogi and Hawaiian pork belly. I didn't remember having the green tea sea salt at the other location, but it was super good here.  Only downside when I visited was that they didn't yet have their alcohol license, but they said they would have it soon. I'll definitely be back if I'm craving KBBQ on this side of town.",

The layout of the restaurant allows for large parties or small intimate settings. I particularly enjoy eating at the bar as I dine alone most of the time. The prices are reasonable unlike some of the other Korean restaurants I have visited in Vegas  which offer none of the atmosphere for triple the price and slap on \"unfinished meal\" charges. The location is in a safe area and the music in the restaurant makes it appealing. They could have a few more selections in drink like bokbunjaju but I won't take marks from it. I particularly enjoy that they will give you the appetizers you want if you ask for more, they are very accommodating. All in all, this is definitely a top choice to take friends, family or business associates. I even did my retirement from the Army party there!",

I have to say this was probably one of the best dining experience I've had at a new restaurant. They staff were all on point. Service was impeccable. The food came out quickly after ordering and servers came by our table constantly checking up on us.   This will be my new go to Korean BBQ spot. They have all you can eat for $22. Great selection of meat & appetizers. The quality of the meat was great. Two thumbs up!   They are in the process of getting their liquor license.

Eugene was a wonderful manager in Henderson so it's no surprise that he's doing a fantastic job here! The staff here have the same bright, friendly, fun personalities that made us fall in love with Gen three years ago so prepare yourself for really great and entertaining service! All you can eat meat is not just a gimmick here, they will happily feed you to the brim and still offer you more. You'll love it here! Trust the Gen Regulars!  Shout out to Mizzo, thank you for the fabulous service!",

    "text": "Have tried many Korean bbq joints in Vegas. This one is good but the whole family agreed it doesn't better our favorites. They all do a decent job so it depends on your point of view, but what we didn't like about Gen was the following:  1. Banchan dishes are small and we had to order some of them repeatedly and oftentimes the waiters would just forget to bring them.  2. Their bulgogi marinade is unlike any I've tried. Seems to lack the traditional sweetness, soy and other requisite ingredients. Not sure how you can mess up this quintessential Korean dish.  3. Very loud music, too much party atmosphere. It's not the strip.  4. Full price for any kid over 7 years old, based on height. Not even my 9 year old was even close to eating $22 worth of bbq.  Thumbs up for the nice green tea salt, a nice surprise that you can't find too easily elsewhere. Banchan recipes were tasty and fresh. Garlic calamari was a hit. So was the head-on shrimp.",

They sat us at one of their big booths that only had one grill. It was hard as heck first because there was six of us and waiting for food was no bueno. It would have been nicer if they sat us at their other tables that had two grills.  We requested to have us move and instead of moving us to the two grill table they split us into 2 groups of 3. I  suppose that was better than one grill.  Each time we ordered meat, we ordered some Gyoza. And they were bomb as fuck!! So while waiting for the meat to cook, we were eating something. And I love gyoza and their gyoza was bomb.   They didn't have egg which was kind of lame.  They don't do half orders of meat which was odd. It was hard because after awhile you don't know if you're going to finish the meat and they charge you for not finishing so not being able to go half order was hard.   The meat tasted pretty good there, they also had seafood which I'm not a fan of but my group was so they seemed to enjoy it.  I rate this place a 4 because they have great service, the food was great and the ambiance was nice. I would have given this place a 5 but they didn't have egg and they don't do half orders.",

They got our order wrong twice and they always seem to be rushing and frazzled.  I understand though, it's a new place and I'm sure they're still trying to get the hang of it all. The food itself was good. Some of meat was a little dry, but you can't really go wrong with all you can eat for $22.  Heads up though, \"until further notice\" they don't serve alcohol yet because they don't have their license. That was a bit of a let down, lol. But that will be resolved after the grand opening.  I'll be back then.",

It's so great to have one closer to us. For all the KBBQ lovers out there, this is a must try! When we first walked in, we were surprised to see how spacious it is and a lot of seating. We were thinking it's going to be crazy pack with a long wait like it is back in the Bay. We were happily greeted by everyone that works there. Let me tell you something, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! They are so on it! I love it!! Once we got seated, our server, Justin, was literally there to take our orders and the food came out to cook less then 2 minutes later. They would come and check on us so often that we always had a full glass of water and more food coming in. They would seriously take the empty plates as soon as we put it down. Talk about GREAT SERVICE! I mean I can go on forever about how great they all were but I'm here to tell you about the food too! The must order is the Jap Chae, Brisket, Pork Belly, Premium Steak, Spicy Calamari, Shrimp and Spicy Bulgogi. The lunch all you can eat is $16.99! I know dinner is around $20-$26 a person but I haven't had the dinner at that location yet. I'll update this once I do! No beer or alcohol served yet but they will soon. My advice is, use the tongs to put all your meat in there slowly versus throw in everything on the grill.. especially if it has liquid on there! Some people were new and saw flames go up pretty high on their station lol. Let's please keep this location for a long time.. they just opened the end of December haha! This location doesn't have rice paper which was sad on my part because I love wrapping my meats with it but they do have daikon. The sides that they give you are great selections like fish cake, kimchee in different ways, potato and a few more that I just forget but ate. I wish I took more pictures but I was hungry. Lol next time! Enjoy my fellow foodies!!",

Service wAs great, our food arrived promptly to put on the grill, drinks always kept full, and the grill plate swapped out twice to make sure we could cook up our proteins! My favorite protein was the bulgogi, we ordered 3-4 plates of this. Pork belly was good, maybe could have been sliced a little thinner as it took awhile to cook and if not cooked through, it is chewy. The only thing we didn't care for was the shrimp and squid, the shrimp were fine just a bit fishy ( it is seafood tho) and re squid was way too chewy.  For dessert we each had a macaron (mango and strawberry). We love these.  I definitely recommend this place, makes me want to explore similar concepts where I'm from.",

    "text": "WTF?!?   THIS IS NOT KOREAN BBQ.  This place is terrible!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY GOING TO THIS PLACE.   Remove the fucking Korean from your name, because this is actually Gen Filipino Korean BBQ.  THIS IS NOT KOREAN BBQ.  I don't mean this in a prejudice way.  Most of the employees are not korean, they are Filipino.  Not a problem... I don't have an issue with Filipinos.  But if you're going to run a restaurant, you might want to ensure that everybody is on the same page.   I will tell you right now that I will not go to Korean-owned sushi bars.  The rice and seaweed usually isn't the same quality.  If I was going to a Filipino restaurant, I absolutely would NOT want to go to one run by a bunch of Koreans.  Hell no!!!  By my observation, there was one employee who was Korean and he was manning the bar.  My gut tells me that he is the owner's relative and he is there due to the fact that the liquor bar has the most exposure to profit-loss.    I get it, but I think they should have a Korean at the front desk and a few serving the various tables.  They had none.  Zero!!!  That is why is say...  Gen is NOT a Korean restaurant.  Gen is a Filipino-Korean BBQ joint.    We came here because we were craving Korean BBQ but our regular spot was too packed. I knew that this place just opened up so we gave it a shot.   BIG MISTAKE IF YOU KNOW KOREAN BBQ. We asked for Po-di-cha (regular Korean barley tea) and the guy had no idea what we were talking about.  He brought us Nestle green tea.  Lol.  This is not a joke. My 9-year old pointed to the tea bag and started laughing.    I'll start with the chadol (brisket).  It was cut way too thick. We usually start our Korean bbq with the brisket, but it was terrible here. Almost inedible.   We asked our server for things but he didn't understand us.  None of the servers are Korean.  THAT IS A DISGRACE BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT COOK ANYTHING FOR YOU. Most Korean servers will flip and cut and do most of the work.  At Gen, they do not do shit.  They literally just deliver your AYCE order.    They do not use real sesame oil for their sauces.  That is our main \"dipping\" sauce but theirs was terrible because I think they use vegetable oil. Trust me...  sesame oil is 3x thicker than any other oil out there.  They did not use Sesame oil unless it was watered down.   We asked for go-chu-chang and they gave us the Vietnamese hot garlic sauce.  Wtf?!?!     The beef tongue was good. We asked for the standard lettuce leaf as a side and they don't offer that.  Of course not. That would be way too authentically korean.    Worst part was at the end, we asked them what dessert was included.  The guy said we could choose macaroon ice cream sandwiches.  We ordered five but then when the bill came, we were charged $3.50 for each of the desserts.    I told the server that they were wrong in charging us. He said don't worry about it because they shared tip.  He said just remove it from the tip!!!  Wtf?!?!  This place is TERRIBLE!!!!  There are too many real authentic Korean bbq joints in town. If this place stays in business, they will thrive off the non-Koreans. There is no way in hell that Koreans gave this a 4-star review.    If you want authentic Korean AYCE BBQ, go to Honey Pig or Lee's.  I am so disappointed that I brought my family here.  This was not very tasty.  It wasn't very authentic.  Service was mediocre.  Ugh.  I wish I could say something positive but I can't.",

The atmosphere was wonderful to walk into and very welcoming. Just a fair warning they do not have a liquor license yet (went Jan 9th) so if you are looking to have some beer with dinner you will need to call before going.   When you first sit down you have a variety of different samplers that are offered to you. And they take you order right away and it comes out in a matter of minutes! Never had a wait for slow service which was excellent, however they could of checked on me every so often instead of every 2 minutes. (Then again I was eating alone so they were just trying to friendly) overall the food was a very delicious!  I think this new place has a lot of potential to be a 5 Star but it still needs a little more experience!",

Came in for dinner on a Wednesday night & it was moderately packed. The restaurant is huge with a lot of seating. The smoke that builds up in this restaurant is horrendous. The vent on top of us did not even seem to work.  The front doors were left wide open during dinner service to get some fresh air in the place.  We noticed that the host would go outside several times to gasp for fresh air & when she returned she had to squint her  due to the heavy wall of smoke. I really hope they do fix their ventilation.  Overall good Korean bbq selection, attentive & quick service.  Tips: - Hawaiian steak one of my top favorites.  - 2 hour time limit. - Mango Ice cream macaroons for the finale.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to try this place out for a long time. I normally wouldn't have picked to be here on a Friday night because it was extremely busy. Ventilation was bad I think the venting system was being over taxed the side door was open and a portable fan placed in front to help ventilation. We were lucky enough to be seated right next to it, so that really helped with the smoke. Also, because of the amount of people, the noise level was extremely high. Other than that, everything else was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Especially since we needed to have our server explain how everything works. Since we wanted to try a variety of different things, our server suggested that we should do half orders so we took his advice. Here is the run down of what we tried (it's not in order): Premium Steak, Beef Tongue, Beef Bulgogi, Spicy Baby Octopus, Korean Fried Chicken, Signature Galbi, Gyoza, Jap Chae, Shrimp and Garlic Calamari. All of the items we had tasted great, but some stood out more than others. We ordered them multiple times! That list was Beef Bulgogi, Premium Steak, Spicy Baby Octopus, Signature Galbi . The whole staff was constantly working. They all moved very efficiently. It was an awesome sight to witness! Since I work in the service industry, I pay close attention to things your average customers wouldn't. Also, I have to mention that when we first got there they said it would probably be a 30 minute wait, but they sat us in about 5 minutes. They get a pass on the bad ventilation and loudness of the place because of how crowded they were. I'll be back here again. I definitely will try to come here on an off time.",

    "text": "Have to give 2 stars sadly.  When this place first opened up, I raved about it a lot because not only was the food amazing but the service was always pretty good too.  The past few times we've gone though, we've been pretty disappointed. The hostess at the front are always rude and snappy. They're really young too so that might have something to do with their attitude.  One of the hostesses was on her phone the last time I went, she didn't even bother looking up at me or apologizing, instead asking rudely \"how many\".   This past time I went, the waiter was really rushing. Made my boyfriend and I feel like we needed to hurry up and eat. Earlier before we sat down, I saw a booth on the other side and so I asked the hostess if we could sit there. She said those booths are for parties of 6 or larger. Being a former hostess myself, I understood. Literally 10 min. later, a couple sits down there. Then to the other booth to the right, a 3 top sits at that one. Ok cool? You didn't have to lie to us haha.   I had to ask for the server to fill my water up 3 times. He kept looking at my empty cup on the side of the table but not once did he offer to refill it.  Our grill wasn't even on, even after they delivered the food, I had to ask someone.  The food runner with glasses looks like he hates life. He kept putting the wrong things on our table, he just looks like he's lost. Every time I see him actually.   Overall, probably won't be returning. What a shame, I've been telling everybody and they moms about this place..it's going down hill real quick is all I gotta say.",

I called and they said it's a 15 minute wait, I arrive 20 seconds later and they now say it's a 20 minute wait.  There were many empty tables around the restaurant and still many people waiting. We ended up waiting 30 minutes and got sat, after me asking what's taking so long because there were so many empty tables.  The shrimp and calamari and the octopus tasted and smelled like chlorine, I kid you not.  The mushrooms and veggies had no mushrooms.  The chicken had an inedible taste. Some of my beef orders were alright but not great. Water tasted and smelled like chlorine as well.  I also had to flag down our waitress every time. She wasn't coming to see if we wanted anything else or if we were OK, so I always had to either ask for her or flag her down.  Horrible experience.",

The guy couldn't seem to remember that I wanted a coke and when we asked for an extra set of Tongs he ended up giving us a dirty pair! I definitely don't need to be touching my food with that! After that it just kept getting worse. The manager came up and asked if we were all done but before I got to order my desert he walked away. Then at the end after getting the check back they forgot my card and had two people running around to find it like it was misplaced.  Overall the place is a good place to go if your craving KBBQ. We will probably be back again. Just hoping that was a \"off\" day for them.",

We had asked for two clean trays to place our cooked meats and they were so efficient that before we could even move them onto the table for use in the area we were needing them someone attempted to pick them up multiple times, assuming we were finished with them based on location on the table.   There is a 2 hour limit on your occupation time at the table, plenty of time since they were so efficient with delivering items with little to no delay.   There was a short line when we went because it is such a popular establishment around dinner so plan to wait a little especially with a larger party.  Well worth the wait however!",

    "text": "KBBQ is not one of the foods I crave. However, I have tons of friends who do, so eventually I get dragged out to most of the major places in town. Gen's new west side location finally warranted a visit, as the new location eliminates the hassle of hiking out to Henderson.  I love this building and have watched it go through three other restaurants over the past few years. Gen feels like the best fit so far, and the clubby lighting isn't as off putting as I normally find it. Space is large, several seating options, plenty of larger tables for groups, $22/pp is more than reasonable for what you'll get here.  The menu is pretty huge, as are the portions. Come with a group or after a day of fasting for the biggest bang for your buck. The banchan were plentiful not quite as great as my favorite spot, but the meat is definitely swoon-worthy: platters of pork belly in several different styles (red-wine marinated being my fave), beautiful towers of rolled brisket, and my personal favorite, the garlic calamari. I haven't even had all they offer across a couple of visits, there are so many choices. Save room for macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert. I'd rather allocate space for that than drinking, but they have a huge bar menu too if you're into that sort of thing.  Shout to the super attentive staff who are on top of drink refills, always asking what they can bring you next, change out the grill before I even think it's needed, and just generally have a good attitude, no matter who I've had so far.",

    "text": "I mean...they're still only charging $22 for dinner and they'll seat my fata$$ solo (meaning they seat parties of one).   My personal pro-tip. If you want a side of fried chicken or japchae have at least three other people to split it with. They say the portions are small but the portions are too big for ppl who want to use their most of their stomach space for grilled meats and seafood.   Another (possibly obvious tip) stagger your marinated and unmarinated meat because the only thing they have to grease up the grill is unmarinated meat. They're very liberal and quick with the grill changes but if you go unmarinated then marinated, you won't have to ask as much.   I like spice and calamari so I recommend the cajun calamari as something different to try here that you probably won't find or try other places. I don't recommend it if you don't like calamari. I don't think it'll convert you but If you do it's tasty.   The quality of the meat is good for the price. It's the best I've had among ayce places and they don't overdo it with the marinade on the marinated meats.   I was in the mood for soondubu. I'm not an expert or aficionado. I just like it. But while I liked mine as an owner, I'm not sure I'd recommend it to the discerning or the newbies. This is tofu soup for someone's who's thinking, \"yeah, tofu soup from an ayce kbbq place seems like a good idea tonight, and goodness that's a long sentence, and why am I still talking to myself?\"   Lastly, I guess I went during the grand opening. I can understand you want a lively atmosphere, but I don't need the bass booming during my meal. I don't know who does. \"Time to eat, let's turn up the music!\" said no one ever, \"I want to have to nurse a headache after my meeeeaaal!!!\"   Now, after all that. You might be baffled by the five stars. But the service was good, the food was good, the price was good. And after complaining four times (two before being seated, and twice after being seated [they asked]) the music got low enough that I didn't try to run to Walgreens and get ear plugs.  4.5/5",

    "text": "I really want to rate them 3.5 stars, but the lack of attention during the last half hour of our dining experience made me round down to 3. Definitely not a 4 star in my book. At first though, the service was top notch. We got our orders out quickly and the drinks were refilled promptly. After the restaurant got busier our waiter disappeared. We ordered meats and never got them. Finally we just gave up and asked for our check as the waiter was delivering food to another table. Now for the food:  The ban chan left much to be desired with very small portions (literally 2 tablespoons of potato salad). Additionally the taste of the ban chan was meh. The fish cake strips had no flavor, the Kim Chee was very mild and the pickled onions with jalapenos had no jalapenos.   The meat:  Premium steak: a slab of beef with a huge strip of fat. Definitely wasn't ribeye but top sirloin I believe. It really didn't have much flavor but cooked nice and tender on the grill.   Galbi short ribs: these weren't as sweet as I'm used to but still tasted great with the crisp of the grill. For a party of 3, the portion was 2 short ribs, which we reordered 4 times but got 3 actual orders.   Beef belly: another tasty meat we ordered repeatedly due to the tiny portion size. This might have been my favorite meat of the meal. The beef bacon was thinly sliced and fatty which meant it cooked up quickly.   Beef tongue: thinly sliced tongue that was very tender with a strong beefy flavor. It was very lean and went well with the sesame oil with salt and pepper combo.   Red wine pork belly: tasted nothing of any pork belly I've ever had. This was more like a bland really tough piece of pork. Even though they only gave us 2 pieces of pork belly (bacon size), it was really hard for the 3 of us to choke it down. I'm not ashamed to say that I hid a portion of it under my rice!   Spicy baby octopus: the portion was nice, 3 whole baby octopuses with a spicy red sauce tossed with sliced white onions and green onions. The taste was bold and flavorful.   KFC: fried nuggets of chicken smothered in what tasted like a ketchup based sweet sauce. It was cold by the time it made it to our table and was therefore less appealing.   Overall the food wasn't bad but when you're used to eating at other bbq joints with amazing sides (like Hwaro) it just leaves something to be desired.   At the end of our meal we waited what seemed like an eternity just to get our check. This is my number 1 pet peeve. Don't make me chase you down to pay you!",

Was surprised and I like that they expanded that far.   Anyway, this is a newer location. Used to go to the one by the galleria mall in Henderson.   The place is nice, the service is on point and super quick and the long and many choices of meat is superb. Small portions to try more meats is definitely up my alley. All for about $20? Yesssssss!! Haha.   It is a little loud sometimes but its not too bad. You can tell it caters more to the younger demographic instead of an older group of 60yrs plus. But who am I to say what people's preferences are? Grandma can eat and jam to some loud tunes for sure.   Anyway, TRY THE PREMIUM STEAK. Cuts like butter and holy hell, it so good if you know how to grill it. Brisket, thick pork belly, tiny intestines, Korean Fried Chicken, Pork Cheese Katsu!!!,Jap Chae and a lot more. The list goes on and nothing I've tried has disappointed.   Not my ultimate fave kbbq spot, but I am a repeat guest here. It's on the cheaper side, more choices, service is great and all around delicious. Try it out!",

I definitely will come back to enjoy the great food!!!",

Waited about 5 min and we were seated. The best part about this place are the servers and the quality of their meat. Our server was Austin, he gave great recommendations, provided quick service, and was very attentive. Our cups were never empty. Not only him, but all the other servers who came by to check on us and drop off food. It was a nice change because usually at ayce places, they tend to forget about you after the third order. Also, the way they season their protein here is very good, very distinct and different flavors rather than everything tasting like sesame oil. Although this place is great, I had to subtract a star for two reasons. One, our table did not have a vent fan above it (some tables do, but our particular section did not). Two, the only dessert they have here is ice cream macaron and it's additional cost at $3.95 I believe, and they are tiny!",

I will add that we came here for a birthday dinner so yes our party was a little big but we gave this server no reason to be rude to us. I work in a high volume customer oriented place as well so I know how stressful it can get. At the end of our meal, we asked to have a check for our table of FOUR since our party was split up at different tables AND SHE SAID that we can only do ONE payment. So after paying, we asked ANOTHER server just out of curiosity if it was possible to have paid with two payments and she said we could've done 3 payments if we wanted. Our server's name was CRIZALAYNNE so if you want to have a good experience there I would ask for a different server if you end up with her. She DID NOT deserve our 18% gratuity for ruining our first experience here. For a 70th birthday dinner which we thought was going to be a memorable one, it just sucks it had to be memorable in a BAD way all thanks to our server.",

We always go to Henderson location and it's always been a great dining except that we have to wait for 30 to 1 hr to get a table but its worth a wait.Meanwhile the new location in Sahara ave. has always been a disaster.  The First time dining experience was GREAT! Second time sining experience was not so lucky, we order the kfc chicken and in the middle of our dining I was chewing on a RAW CHICKEN  and the rest of the chicken was crispy except that some of them were RAW when I cut it with the scissor. The Manager apoligize and got my meal free of charge but i got sick for 4 days. We gave it the benefit of the doubt that we went their with my 17 year old daughter and 8 year old son. Unfortunately they charge us a full prize for my 8 year old which is $21.99 coz he is above the height limit they have at the door which I even brought his birth certificate to show but they didn't even consider to even look at it, they just say, it is company's policy which is BS. We are both tall parents and our child's Grandparents are also tall which means we expect our kids to be above height average. So they should remove that 10 year old sign of the kids price for dining. We just left coz I don't want to argue and dine somewhere else. Third and last dining experience was HORRIBLE!!! Listen people we like this place so much that we put aside all the negative experience we have BUT this time we found a leg of a cockroach in my Chadol beef and I point it out to our server. Manager came and he says he things it's from the pineapple on a Hawaiian beef. We told him it didn't came from the Hawaiian beef it came from the chafdol beef brisket, he says ok I will just replace your Chadol beef order. THIS PLACE HAVE THE WORST ASIAN MANAGER  and AMERICAN MANAGER! GUARANTEED WE WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN! THREE STRIKES YOUR OUT!!!",

    "text": "This was my first time ever eating at this place and it started off great. My first problem was that I had trouble using chopsticks. I tried, but after a few minutes we asked for a fork. We were told they would bring it right out for me. A few minutes past and still no fork so we ask again. Now with an annoyed look by our server he says yes, but never returns with the fork! We ask for the 3rd time, get told yes and he still never brings it out. We give up and I continue to struggle with the chopsticks to eat my rice, and I just use my fingers to grab the meat! After a couple of servings I looked at the sauce I had been served and saw what looked like antennas. I looked closer and saw that there was a moth type of bug floating in it. We immediately told our server and after he closely investigated the sauce himself, he asked me if it was there the whole time. He takes the sauce away and brings me out a fresh one. No apology at all!! Now my friend and I are grossed out. After sitting there another server sees our expression, notices that we aren't eating then comes over and asks if everything is alright. I tell him no, there was a bug in my sauce, and that we are disgusted. He apologizes and proceeds to get the manager. The manager comes over and asks us what's going on. We explain what the problem was and he asks us if we know what time the bug got into the sauce!! How the heck are we supposed to know? It looked just like the flakes from whatever seasoning they put in it, so it wasn't noticed right away! The only reason I did notice was because I happen to see the antennas which made me look closer! We told him we have no clue, and then he asked us if it was right away when we first sat down to eat, or closer to the end. We tried to give him our best estimate of how long we were there, and how long after that I noticed it. He starts asking us, \"So was it about 5, 10 minutes ago\"? We tell him it was longer than that, and he tells us we literally told him about 5 or 10 minutes ago. NOT TRUE!! We never mentioned a time. He starts going back and forth with us, so we told him to ask our original server that we told so he could verify how long ago it was, but he (the manager) brushed that off and kept saying we told him less time. We explained that nothing was done by our original server other than him bringing out new sauce. We FINALLY got a hold of a different server, told him what happened, he apologized and said he would notify the manager, and NOW here we are talking to you 5 minutes later. He gives us this long spiel about how bugs come though open doors all the time and that it's possible the moth looking bug flew into my sauce after it was brought out to me. He says the moth was probably on it's last leg ready to die and happen to fall in my sauce. The sauce was right in front of me so I would have seen it moving around trying to escape!!! He tells us it's just something that happens, it's not their fault, and that there's nothing he can do, thanked us and walked away. He was very rude and cold!!! He spoke to us as if we were lying and trying to get out of paying for our meal which was not the case whatsoever!! We will NOT be returning to this location again!! If you like RUDE with service and EXTRA BUG protein in your sauce, this is the spot to go. If not, you may want to try a different location.",

She was awesome explained to us how the ordering worked and using the grill...now we started ordering alot we began with the gen flat iron steak was delicious! The shrimp was alittle difficult to deal with so we didn't really enjoy that so much but then we moved on to the pork belly and the red wine pork belly was amazing! The beef tongue was so tender and flavorful keep in mind they give you seasoning and sides and hot sauce to accompany all the meats! Then we ordered the KFC which was the Korean friend chicken wow mind blown delicious after the first one my table ordered 7 more!! When it comes to the food it was definitely to my liking the service was great!! I like that they change your grill out for you as often as you want so it keeps it from burning your meats!! Like I said everything was great!!! It was time to pay and my card for some reason wasn't working with the machine there and same came to my table and basically yelled out sorry your card was \"Declined\" super loud I was shocked for one cause my card works perfectly fine so I don't know but the way she came up and yelled it out embarrassed me in front of my friends! She could have come up to me alittle more quietly and told me but other than that it was great! I would definitely be recommending this place and I will be going back!!",

    "text": "To be quite honest with you all, I am not sure where to begin with this review of Gen Korean BBQ House, much like how the server had no idea when to begin refilling our water cups. It takes approximately 10 days without water for the average human to die of dehydration, which was clearly taken into account by this establishment as the all-you-can-eat-but-not-drink time limit was set to 2 hours. I must commend them for their forward thinking. It got so bad that at one point, myself and 8 other patrons were forced to participate in an in-house spelling bee contest in order to gain access to the coveted cup of water. We were asked to spell \"rondayvoo,\" which apparently is not the correct was to spell rondayvoo. To the surprise of nobody, their thirst for literary excellence was not quenched.   There is much more to say, but I am writing this review with what is left of my withering energy. I can feel my senses numbing. I struggled to decide whether or not to contact my loved ones for the last time, or warn all future customers of Gen Korean BBQ House. My decision is obvious.  I farewell thee, and hope for a equally brighter, more hydrated future for our children. With that, I tip my glass (and a mandatory 18% gratuity) to the readers of this review, a final sip for us all, because that is all you are going to get.",

Well, this is like the feeling finally feels like the middle of town and a God send.  It was difficult to choose as Aloha Kitchen was just on the corner.  This is like old stomping grounds for lots of people including me.  Anyways, it was like accident for my girlfriend and me to find this place we had to U-turn to double check that our peepers did see \"Gen Korean BBQ\".  Ok, let's go and the parking lot was packed.  A host was there and we were sat quickly in a booth around 8pm on a Wednesday.  The low slung ceiling made the place a bit hotter inside which i loved.  The music was more of your popular music which was I thought easier to listen to the constant, loud rap music of the sunset location.  I think our server was Jomel but everyone was just awesome. For 20.00 the portions just kept coming.  My favorite is the Gen premium steak, beef bugolgi.  I can just eat that all day. The red wine pork belly was interestingly sweet. Mixed vegetables with mushrooms is good just don't burn it.  We had the hot plates changed probably twice.  I am getting hungry while typing a five star review of Gen Korean bbq. I have to go again.  Taking the girlfriend as she will be impressed but, it almost feel like a personal need to dine here.",

The service is always excellent and fast, which if you've read my review of the Gen in Henderson, you'll know that's almost unheard of in any Korean restaurants.  This Gen on Sahara meets all my expectations and I am super happy that there's now not only one close to my house but one close to my office!  The meat is always decent, some much better than the others.  For example, the beef tongue.  No one I've introduced beef tongue to at Gen has ever disliked them.    The price is more than reasonable. Actually, it makes you wonder what kind of margin they are running at because it's just so much bang for your buck!    I don't see why I should try other Korean BBQ anymore because Gen has everything I want and need.  I highly recommend any locations of Gen.",

Although this yelp page is for the Sahara location, I went to the one in galleria mall. The meats are exceptional quality. I have never had Korean bbq that is so delicious! And you don't leave smelling like the place, which is a perk. Service but Shea was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this place!",

The side dishes they have are pretty good and they also serve a salad.  They have rice if you want but if I'm doing ayce i don't want to get full on side stuff.  All of the meats are good so depending on what kind you like you really can't go wrong.  The sea food is alright for Korean  bbq i dont recommend getting it.  For dessert we got ice cream mochi it's not included with the ayce so it was a extra 3.50 for each.  We loved them definitely worth it.",

So normally I have to book one yr in advance at my favorite restaurants due to the fact that it's my birthday and Valentine's Day and normally it's hard to get a reservation...  But here I am one day prior to deciding to come check out this restaurant. I called at exactly 11 a.m and. a young lady answered the phone and politely took my reservations with no problems, no issues, no complaints.  Then the next day... they sent you a text message to confirm your reservation which I like so that's pretty cool..  So as my first time here ...the atmosphere is cool.. the bathrooms are clean but to me the tables were small.. You need space it's when you know what it is that you want to order... however the food was really good.. the flavor was good and even when you cooked it the meat was good..  For the menu and what you get I thought was pretty good so the only reason I gave four stars is because I wish there was a little bit more space for my dishes I don't like to rush when I eat...  All in all happy birthday to me I would come here again.",

Came here on a Saturday night, and it was a pretty full house, fragrant with grilled meat that you will definitely leave smelling like your meal.  Love that they have drinks here! Soju galore! The soju capri is a fun choice if you're feeling adventurous. (Not included in AYCE)  They have appetizers like gyoza and jap-chae, veggies, and your typical side dishes.  Hostess failed to greet us, but the rest of the staff was friendly, attentive, gave reccomendations, and solicitated feedback. They were also very fast is bringing out what we ordered within a 5 minute timeframe. So good job there guys!   Now for the important stuff! The meat! Porkbelly dishes were thick, most of them weee pretty good with acceptable flavor. Except for the wine porkbelly. That was the most bland and dry/chewy piece of porkbelly I have ever eaten, also the purple color was a little off putting. Briskets and beef tongue were cut thin. We ordered a steak, or something along those lines, and it was huge! You definitely get some quality meat here, and they don't skimp at all.  They have seafood here as well! The squid/calamari was so tender and tasty! The octopus wasn't bad either, but it did look scary at first uncooked haha. Shrimp were not marinated, but a good option to start out your meal with(you peel off the shell yourself).  They have ice cream macarons here (not included in AYCE, so 3.50 each). Totally worth it if you love sweets! They have strawberry, green tea, coffee, and mango flavor.  The only thing I have to say is that I was incredibly thirsty after the meal. I'm usually a very hydrated person, but I was so parched and guzzling down water hours later. So that might be an indication of what they use to marinate thier meat/seafood with.  Overall good! I'll be back!",

Not horrible, but just ok.  The space is big... lots of cooktop tables.  That also means lots of smoke and grease in the air.  The owners need to turn up the exhaust fans or something.  They need better ventilation pronto. Plenty of meats and apps to choose from off the menu, but the quality of meat wasn't great.  Everything was too sweet... too much sauce or marinade... really mediocre cuts.   Not the worst, but many better choices for Korean BBQ.",

Definitely try her variation of the peach and mango Capri drink (if you are of age of course). My friends and I love to come here and will continue coming back for the food, service, and drinks. Haven't been to the happy hour just yet but will be back to do so. Our favorites from the meats are usually the beef tongue, brisket, and the Hawaiian steak. For the appetizers you have got to try their KFC and gyozas. They are really yummy and come out in a timely manner depending on high volume or low volume time. I love their fish cake and house salad personally because I like to save my appetite for the meat but feel free to ask their staff, they can usually help you try something you might like, and if not, well at least you can say you tried it. This place is great for small or large groups and has a beautiful interior with great lighting and music for a relaxing day or evening of food. Hope you love it as much as I do!!",

I brought my son here for his birthday and we barely left the restaurant for 2 mins to the parking lot and my son forgot his birthday card at the table and when we went back no one helped! I even went in and spoke to who appears to be the manager and she was rude and unhelpful! I get it it's busy but this would only take a minute of your time and from the money we spent on this place was ridiculous to be treated like that. Also she did come to our table once when we were dining and we wanted to order more food and she didn't even wait for the next order instead she just took one order didn't say anything and left! They only want the money and they could care less about the customer dining experience!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO TO THIS PLACE!! Your not the only Korean bbq in town that's for sure!!",

My friend was able to get a table before we arrived so that was nice compared to the other location where they will not see you unless the entire party is there. And our server was very nice and once we ordered are Meats they came pretty quick. The only downside to our entire experience was they are always trying to take the plates and I like to keep one for the done meat so that was kind of irritating when they took the plate that I had the cooked meat for. We will definitely be going back as it is much closer than the other location!",

Hopefully they can keep it up because it seemed like the service at the Henderson location could be hit or miss.  It's been a few months since we went to the Henderson location but there seemed to be a few differences between this location and the last time we went to the Henderson one. This Gen had two kinds of salt vs. just the green tea salt at Henderson. The galbi at this location also came bone-in whereas the galbi at Henderson was boneless. This location is less busy for now, but I'm sure it'll fill up as word gets out.  One negative about this location is that the ventilation isn't as good as the Henderson location, at least at our table. Other than that though, for sure a great experience overall and we're very happy to see Gen come to this part of town.",

    "text": "Two different perspectives...  By my Korean standards, I would've give the food a 2.5. While you can't really go wrong on meat, it was ok. And then the japchae, soondubu and side dishes... meh. It mimicked the real thing, but tasted nothing like it was really supposed to.  By my normal standards... a 3.5. The portions were pretty small. My friends tried about just everything that was beef and chicken, and I would say to stick with the steak meats if you're looking for real korean bbq but the flavored meats weren't too bad.   service was amazing though. I loved the attention by the servers and our cups were rarely left empty long.   I've been to the gen in California and this is NOT what it was like. Which is why I think I'm more disappointed. Was hoping for a new bbq spot to go with friends but moving on.... So overall, ok. Will I go back... maybe.",

You definitely get your moneys worth.  My most recent experience was amazing only because our server Jovanny was outstanding! Although he had 3-4 other large parties to tend to he always came by to our table and made sure we had everything. He's the best server I've ever had not just at this place but in general. He made us feel welcomed and always took care of us despite his manager Linette who didn't make our last visit so good. We would order drinks and she wouldn't let him serve us drinks then proceeded to tell us they were out of a specific drink we ordered but then we were notified that she had lied for no reason in particular. So when Jovanny had served us our requested drink she proceeded to lecture him in front of us even though Jovanny did nothing wrong but serve us. She was merely upset at the fact that she was wrong for lying but used her title as manager over him. If it wasn't for Jovanny's excellent service I would've gave a low rating but he made a bad experience into a great one simply because of his service and personality. If you ever visit this location I recommend you have Jovanny as your server.",

Lots of open space made for comfortable dining especially with KBBQ since it's always filled with smoky goodness. The place is super modern and \"club like\" blue lights, new decor, the music selection is great too! Made for a fun atmosphere! The service was terrific, our server was super efficient, friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to order. He also frequently changed our grill, which was great. The price for all you can eat was way decent for the quality and service we received. I believe it was $22 a person for dinner! The Bulgogi, Brisket, and short ribs were delicious! We will definitely be coming back!",

If you're  under 40 inches... you eat free! 40-50 inches 9.99... and 50 inches + full price...  I'm in love with this Korean bbq place.. and I'm not only saying that because the hostesses here are 11/10 but because this place is well structured.  The moment you finally get seated.. your table is set up for you with multiple little condiments to dip your meat in. In addition, there is an order of house salad which goes well with the meats!  There are 36 different options you are able to order for 21.99 ALL YOU CAN EAT... and the ones with the thumbs up are chef recommended. The stars or asterisks indicate that they are spicy.  My personal favorites are the spicy pork belly, brisket, garlic chicken and short ribs.   Service is great too. If your hungry.. you're gonna thank them... they are as quick as this year going by",

    "text": "I came here last night with some friends and had a good evening but wasn't blown away by the culinary experience. The best thing about Gen in my opinion is the service. I received my drink order and our first round of meats in literally less than a minute. We almost became overwhelmed with the amount of food piling up on our table. I do also like the interior here, and it's very spacious and modern chic.   As we cooked the meats over the stovetop grill, I felt that the meat was sticking to the grill much more than it should and it continued this way the whole night. Our grill actually became covered with charcoal and became unusable pretty quickly. However, the service helped us change out the stovetops promptly.   The complimentary appetizers were very standard, but I did personally like the salad. The best meat i had of the night was the premium steak and the pork belly since both of these were tender and flavorful. I really also enjoyed the tofu soup since it added some tanginess to break up the heavy savory dishes.   I did not enjoy the galbi one bit since it just tasted like sweet ambiguous meat. Most of the pieces I had were hard to chew through and very fatty. I couldn't even dip the meat in the dipping sauce to add some depth of flavor since the dipping sauce here consists of sesame oil and salt. The beef tongue was better, but it still lacked the succulent high grade quality of meat that I enjoy.   I understand that you get what you pay for. You can't expect the highest quality meat with a very affordable AYCE price. I am impressed at the large selection of meats and dishes and again I am very pleased with the great service we received here. I would come back here with a large group or for a big celebration, but I wouldn't come if i'm looking for an intimate date setting or gourmet meats.",

    "text": "Pro Tip: Bring a change of clothes if you're planning on going out after eating.  I've now been to Gen 3 times.  I was reluctant to go that second time, because I did not have a good experience the first time around.  To my surprise, the menu had changed and the meat selection was definitely an upgrade.  And the best part is dinner is only $22!!!!!  You won't find another AYCE KBBQ place that serves kalbi for anywhere near $22!!!    Here my list of Gen's Greatest Hits:  Gen premium steak - oh so tender and juicy, might be my favorite item. kalbi - well marinated, tender, and very tasty.  cajun shrimp - i'm not sure what the cajun seasoning blend is, but i do  know it is delicious  spicy baby octopus - smothered in kochujang sauce, these ocotop.odes were scrumptious and not too spicy.  i highly recommend this item.  bulgogi - sliced thicker than what I prefer, the meat was a tough and put on my never order again list.  chadol - thinly sliced brisket that melts in your mouth. a must have item.  KFC - korean fried chicken was a bit disappointing.  tasted more like orange chicken from panda express than KFC from other korean joints.  japchae - this one is ok.  A bit on the sweeter side for my taste, but a descent appetizer choice.  gyoza - i admit, i love me some friend dumplings.  Especially when waiting on meats to cook, it is nice to have a cooked item to munch on.  soondoboo - thoroughly disappointed in this dish.  The broth was ok, pretty tasty actually, but they used the wrong tofu!!!!  You don't put firm tofu in soondoboo!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone knows that!!  You use the soft, silken tofu!!  Duh.  If the soondoboo and kfc were better, I'd give this place 5 stars.  As it stands, I can only do 4.  Also, I don't waste my time with pork or chicken.  I only go for beef and seafood.  For the price, service, atmosphere, and quality of food, Gen is no doubt my #1 choice for AYCE KBBQ place in Vegas.",

I've been to a few different Korean bbq places where it's more expensive and you only get around 5 options for meat. Here, for lunch, you pay $16.99 for 32 options! I never had to ask for a water refill and we never had to flag someone down for more meat. Our server was very attentive and I definitely will be coming back soon! I highly recommend :)",

The freezer with the dessert is dingy and dirty looking. As for the food we got a bunch of different types of meats all were great. I did ask for two extra Tongs they only give u one but cross contamination could be an issue especially if u order a chicken dish. And I asked for an extra dish to be able to place the cook food on so it could be cut to serve so I did not have to put it back on the dish it was served on.",

    "text": "I love that they finally opened a Gen KBBQ House in Las Vegas! No more driving all the way to Henderson for Gen! This restaurant looks a lot bigger compared to the one in the galleria. Ambiance is the same -- very hip & modern while they play hip-hop/r&b in the background.   I've been here a couple of handful of times to finally write a review based on all of the different experiences I have had. Service can be spotty. I've had good and bad service -- it's not really consistent. It also depends on who you got. Some servers offer spectacular service compared to others. Last time my family and I were here (last Sunday), we had to ask for our radish paper three times before they finally gave it to us. Also, our seating area wasn't clean. There was a piece of japchae on my seat (ew..). Cleanliness is extremely important to me, especially if it's a place where you'll be eating.   Food quality also varies. I usually order lots of brisket (so good with radish paper, lettuce, garlic, & ssamjang), & often times it's delicious and melts in your mouth. However, it's not always consistent. There are times it was really rubbery -- & mind you, we did not overcook it. That would be my only complaint about the food, though. Most often than not, it's delicious. And my husband and I love coming here time and time again because the size of their booths are huge (we have twin babies & an 8 year old), plus their price is just right for how many items they have on their menu.   My person favorite food items here are their Hawaiian pork belly, brisket (chadol), wine pork belly, & bulgogi (hubby's favorite)!   Highly, highly recommend coming here to try it out for yourselves!",

Figuring out where to eat for dinner we ended up at Gen Korean BBQ House. And my God that was some of the best food I've eaten. We had wait for about 20 mins to sit down but we had a large group and it was a Friday night. So it was fine. The service was great! We ordered alot of food, we didn't expect to come out so quickly so there was no space on the table for the trays of food. So they provided us with a separate food tray stands to hold the rest.  The foods were very flavorful and seasoned well. They have a huge menu that carries beef, pork, poultry, and seafood. Quite a variety to choose from. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone and would come back again.",

Plenty of decent size flat screen television for entertainment.  Once seated you have your appetizers all set up so you could dig right in!  Menu is pretty simple to read with over 30 choices items to cook on your grill. Ranging from steaks, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp and calamari!  It's an endless all you can eat! Worth every buck!",

As soon as we got there, you can feel their welcome. Totally different atmosphere! Thankfully, we only waited about 10 minutes for them to get a booth ready. As soon as we sat down, ordered drinks and the first round of food. Food was cooked and in our kids bellies within 10 minutes from the time we sat down. Waiters and hostesses were amazing!!! Made sure our kids were ok with everything.   Crappiest service ever!!!! Every where you turn, there was an employee. I think there were more employees than there were guests. All those employees, and they still couldnt get our business. Three groups were seated before us. Ok, they were smaller groups. Fine. A party of 3 seated at a table that we could've fit on? Wait, why? Ok, whatever, maybe there's a better location for us. I ask the manager how much longer and they said they're getting the table ready right now. But then, a bigger group gets seated before us? And they came in after us? Wtf?! That's when they knew they f***ed up. You can see it in their faces. The hostess started talking on her headset and looked around and started typing on her iPad. Yup, we left. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there until they figure out their flow. It's like no one knows what they're doing.",

They are very generous with the portions and keep bringing out more and more meat.    I had never been here before so it would have been good for them to tell you how the place works.   The vents above us didn't seem to work well. There was a draft in the restaurant pushing smoke from the table next to us directly to us.   I wasn't impressed with the variety or quality of the meat. The marinades were too mild and most of the meat to fatty for my likings.   Very limited non meat options.  The KFC came out ice cold. We had to ask for a second order that was warm. Not room temp cold but refrigerator cold.   The place was poorly ventilated and too loud. The music was too loud and made it difficult to talk. Your clothes will smell like the poorly ventilated restaurant.   A lot of people obviously love this place. I don't think it's for me.",

I brought my family and we had a party of 8 and everyone I mean everyone is awesome that work there. They are so nice and attentive. Even did things I didn't expect.. The upper management helped out and I was shocked that they would be helping out..   All the meats was good and fresh. Came out fresh and fast. I can't complain of all the meats and veggies. Just wished they had a dessert option but never fear I went to Dairy Queen lol.  But I'm not  going to lie this place is good.. it's not Mom and pop place but the employees are awesome and you all deserve a high five..",

    "text": "We got horrible service! My whole table we all work in the industry from servers to managers! Let's start off the night so we came we had a reservation but only 3/4 of our party was here so we told the hostess to just sit others 1st we will wait but they kept trying to hurry us! But their rules are once you sat your 2 hours starts! Once again that's why we said let others go before us! So finally we sat! Server comes over....no greet no nothing...just what do you want to drink? Ok I guess its Saturday night it busy! Ok fine...when it came to ordering so my daughter is vegetarian wanted just the cheese corn! So I asked our server...do u have a la carte or can I just order just ayce corn only bc that's literally all she wants! He says no (no explanation, just a blunt NO) He said he will charge me still for the corn and her 2 bites of salad? Because we technically haven't order yet just our drinks! So I said that's fine dont worry about it I'll leave so you dont think im going to try to eat! (With a attitude) he tells me 'well ima charge you still' we both (my daughter and I) just had few bites of salad! I asked him is he serious he said yes...continues to argue and popping a attitude! At this point I'm irritated so I asked a manager! Rolls his eyes and walked off. Manager comes over at 1st she had a attitude too. But calm down after I apologize for having issues! After a few times of her telling me that she will charge me $5 for the corn everytime I order (which I got it, the 1st time) after this when the server comes back like 10 mins with 1 of my guest asking him to come over to get my order btw! I also apologize to him bc i didn't want to make a big deal! Once again just gave me a attitude instead! So onto dinner! My friend is drinking her strawberry lemonade when she happens to look at her cup (the cup is clear btw) it had lipstick all over it! So she got grossed out and ask for a water not charged for it! Server came back slams her water down as shes asking about it being on her check! He snaps back ITS ALREADY DONE! Not necessary! When we asked for forks...he said WE DONT HAVE FORKS! Overall we kept getting our plates slammed  attitude left and right! His name was Prince! We found out thru his nametag! He had another server come finish us off! He didnt even come get payment! His partner Jan and the foodrunners were better! Manager she was Ok Jan and foodrunners were great! Server Prince horrible! I will never come back! No recommendations for this location!!! Work on your attitudes! Dont like your job peace out! I understand it's a busy night but learn customer service skills under stress! I dont think Gen is going to even care about this post but I just want to let the city know! Good food but horrible service!!!",

The ambiance was very lounge like with blue neon lights reflecting off of mosaic mirrored vases. The standard  Korean bbq set up with the round grill in the center of the table where you prepare your own foods was surrounded by salts sauces Kim chi, & ginger and was presented on lovely simple white saucers and plates. The menu was AYCE top quality beef, seafood, chicken and pork. The bulgogi  was so good we ate four servings of it! Not to say the servings were small they were adequate and replaced almost immediately with more by quick service! We also tried or shall I say devoured, shrimp, premium pork belly, garlic pork belly, KFC (Korean fried chicken which is prepared in the kitchen) calamari, beef brisket, Hawaiian beef steak, & gyoza. Last but certainly not least is service! All that food  was served quickly with a smile by Justin and assists. We were gratefully full and ordered the icecream macaroon sandies to go we feel so stuffed we are going now To \"walk it off!!\"",

    "text": "I wanted to go check out this Gen BBQ in Las Vegas since I've been to the Gen BBQ in Cerritos, CA. That location had excellent food and service. I came with a group of 8 and we waited for about 30 minutes on a Saturday night, which was fine since it's the weekend. When we sat down, there is a 2 hour limit. First, we weren't greeted by the hostess and one of them had an attitude and just didn't seem friendly or want to engage with customers. We sat at our table and our server was also not too friendly and didn't seemed like he was too happy serving us. I understand it's a Saturday night, the restaurant gets busy, but don't show that attitude at the table, especially when most of my friends work in the food and beverage industry. There was an issue with my friend's daughter (she's a kid); she's vegetarian and only wanted salad and corn and the server wanted to charge her full price of all you can eat just for eating a salad and corn. Instead of explaining that she can just pay the a la carte, he straight up told my friend that she still had to pay full price. Eventually, she asked for a manager and they sorted that issue. The food was delicious, I ordered the beef bulgogi, Hawaiian steak, iron steak. The service was slow; I had to ask 2-3 times to get extra tongs and forks for our table. Our table didn't really get checked up much and it was frustrating. One server or busser name Elden and another server at the end helped us and was really attentive and helpful. I appreciated that. That's how service should be. Overall, the food was good but they lack service and the hostess should probably change their attitude if they are the first contact as a customer walk in the restaurant and seated to start their dining experience. I will not come back to this Gen BBQ.",

The mashed potato (one of my favorite) green salad, pickled raddish and kimchi are so so good. Also try their fresh seafoods like cajun calamari and garlic shrimp. About their services, they are very fast on giving what you need, they will give you 4 different item and then after that you can order again. We tried their mouthwatering macaron ice cream and it taste good.",

    "text": "My first Yelp review ever. Originally went to another yakiniku type restaurant on Spring Mountain but their wait was ridiculously long so was frantically searching in Yelp for somewhere <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fto.eat&s=b22821c0639dc09a738176c6400fc1e2366d2495ab0157ab41ae0cb7eb2bf8f8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to.eat</a> with my Hangry family. I then looked up Gen on Yelp to see how far the one in Henderson was then remembered seeing a Gen restaurant on Sahara every Sunday as we pass by it after church. I checked on Yelp and low amd behold there were already 7 reviews. I then made a quick phone call to ask how long the wait was. The friendly girl over the phone said at the moment there was no wait so we went ahead and made our way over.  And now my review begins: -Upon entering we were greeted with such a warm and kind welcoming by a lovely girl and three guys. Before we even walked through the doors we could see the excitement in their attitudes that patrons were coming in. Right before we got seated all of the front of house employees in the restaurant yelled out \"Irashaimase\" pardon my rustiness on my spelling.  -The second we were seated Anthony was there ready to take our orders and literally within a couple of minutes our food and drinks arrived. As dinner progressed I noticed how attentive and consistent they were. Another thing I noticed is that it got crazy busy.  -Despite the craziness in the restaurant, every single worker remained enthusiastic and happy to be working there. I believe the owner was there that night waiting on the patrons happily and making sure every single guest was satisfied. The manager even came by to change our grill and wait on us.  -The food was 10 stars out of 5. It was absolutely and Incredibly yummy.  -The restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms. I definitely don't see this place end up on dirty dining...and I am a stickler for cleanliness.   It's so awesome that we don't have to drive a 30 minute drive to the Gen in Henderson. We will definitely be coming back and recommending this location to others.",

The thing we noticed right away was that the ventilation, it was either working poorly or nonexistent.  Smoke was so bad that it made us think twice about staying. But we wanted to give this location a chance. So we sat down and ordered. I really have to say, the serivce was on point. Grill was always changed and our tea was always refilled, the server was really attentive. The food on the other hand, different story. One item we always order is the Galbi. Too plain. it was not marinated at all. It tasted like someone just dipped it in sauce and brought it out.  Very disappointed! We would love to order more and enjoy the ambiance but the smoke was too much so I just wanted to hurry up and eat and get out. I truly hope Corporate/Management takes this seriously.

We went around 8 o'clock without reservations and we were seated within minutes which was extremely nice. We loved the decor and how spacious the whole place was. We got seated into a booth which was very roomy, which I personally loved. All the food fit perfectly onto the table and we ordered a decent amount. The service was astounding! As soon as we got seated our server acknowledged us and told us he would be with us shortly. Even after he walked away someone else stepped right in to make sure we would get drinks quickly. Our server returned no later than 2 minutes and recommended some great meats to try. Our favorites were the Hawaiian pork belly, spicy baby octopus, and the garlic calamari. One of the biggest things for me when going out to eat is having the water glass continuously filled, and our server made sure that it was always filled and that it never reached the bottom. We were always checked up on, made sure our empty plates were taken away almost instantly, and always had the grill tops changed. This place was all around spectacular from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. This place is a definite favorite now and we will DEFINITELY be returning!",

We arrive only to find groups of people hanging around the entrance. We go to put our names in, and the hostess said 2 hours at least. I tell her I just called and they said 20 to 30, and she tells me \"that's just what we're telling people on the phone.\"  As much as I like the food, I'm not sure it's worth dealing with people who'll jerk you around on a special night.",

We came during happy hour and he said we would be charged the happy hour price for drinks.  Unfortunately he left without any notice and it was hard to get service after our initial order.  When we finally waved down somebody they were a little rude and acted like we were an inconvenience for trying to order more food.  We ordered more drinks about fifty minutes before happy hour ended as well.  When we got the check only our first two drinks had the happy hour price.  I would have gladly given this place five stars had we had our first waiter the whole time.  Our waitress just seemed unconcerned and stingy after he left.  She was also kind of rude when she brought our second round of drinks because she almost tossed the glasses and straws on the table.  I teach first grade and deal with rude children all day long, and I expect to be treated better when spending 100 dollars on dinner.",

We normally come on weekends and parties of 4 or more .. tonight was a special occasion as it was the night my girlfriend graduated from college... we got Denise , she was polite the first second we sat down, but we weren't sure of what to order and she seemed to get agitated... we then ordered, even repeated what we wanted.    So out came the food... we only got the food one half of the table ordered and double of one item we ordered and had to eat that because we didn't want to waste.   We ordered a soju carafe(mango), and a Capri drink (pomegranate) The Capri was supposed to be pomegranate.. but it came out in a carafe... I tried to explain it to the person who brought it out but she was confused, so when Denise came back, we explained it to her and she said OK! I got it, she comes to the table with a Capri soju when it should have been a carafe!  I asked 3x for gen sauce, we got one water out of 4 ordered, then when we asked for 3 we got 4... we had to re order some items because it never came.  Quality of the food didn't seem the same either....Such a crappy experience especially when it was to celebrate a big accomplishment.    And no, the place was not busy at all. Truly sucks,  I hope the place isn't going downhill. We always hype the place up to our friends. Not sure when we will return",

They measured him 2 times. Same price for him every time we go. Cool. We have a meal. Service from our serve and food was good as usual.   When we went to close our check we were charged for 3 full priced meals. We mentioned it to our server and he went to go fix it. He tells us the front told him our son was full price. A few minutes pass and one of the ladies from the front..maybe the supervisor comes over. She was rude first off. We explained to her that we were told when we first checked in that our son was half price. She kept saying we had to go and remeasure our son. Keep in mind we were sitting in the back by the restrooms. It was the weekend so trays and people everywhere. At that moment when she kept insisting we get back up to have him measured for the 3rd time We got irritated. As I went to get up to take my son up there she said never mind and that he was half price.   And then to add..with it being a super busy weekend and the commotion of everything. A full tray was spilled all over my guys shoes. Food and liquid went all over and some came on the table. We got an \"oops\". Things happen I know, but with the way the night was going it just added to the frustration.   All in all we ended up being charged correctly and everything was ok. Just the whole situation and how it was handled was pretty irritated. We would frequent pretty often. We haven't been back since.   :/",

Instead of having him cry, out of convenience she asked for another cup since refills are supposedly free.  But we got charged an extra drink over 1/4 cup of soda.  The manager even sided with the server.   Even though kids under 40\" eat for free apparently they are charged full price for drinks!!  Fortunately there are plenty of good Korean bbqs in town, I will not be wasting my time and money on this one again!!!",

Though everything was tasty I think my favorite was the Hawaiian steak and the garlic chicken. The garlic chicken comes with a cheese dip but it's a low profile flavor so it doesn't overwhelm the meat. It's not just meat though on the side we had edamame, kimchi, cole slaw, mashed potatoes. And they serve lots of different sauces, salt and pepper, and a green tea salt and pepper to give a variety of flavors. Our server happy was so patient and kind and answered all of our questions along with impeccable service. We finished up with complimentary ice cream from the GM (who was also extremely nice and helpful). As if amazing food and service wasn't enough the prices are so reasonable and it's all you can eat!! Try it for a date night, with a group of friends, or just to catch up with a friend like I did...you won't be disappointed!",

The host pops an attitude to my cousin who just asked not to be seated yet because not all of our party was there yet. Then our server who's name was #prince by the way who kept giving my sister an attitude because she went to ask to speak to a manager because he won't stop with the eye rolling or slamming plates down or even when she just ask if the corn can be charged separately from the all you can eat price. Because my niece doesn't eat meat. Mind you everyone at our table are all managers in the food and beverage industry. Even us as managers understand it's a Saturday night, it gets busy we understand. The only people who was nice and gave us good service was the busy boys and the other server #jan. I visited the Cerritos, California location and I got really great service on a busy Friday night. I won't be coming back to this location ever again.",

Staff are friendly and accommodating. They let you know everything you need to know if its your first time in Gen's (stuff like; not allowing discovery card, a 2 hour time limit, and charge of $5 if you did not finished everything you ordered...etc). **They do not allow unfinished foods for take outs since it is a All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant.  NOTE: foods quantity are given in small portion but nothing to worry about, you can just reorder until your tummy is satisfied.   RECOMMENDATION: Grab a Macaroon Ice Cream before you go. Its not part of AYCE though, but $3.50 is worth it.",

We had meats being delivered and then sitting idly uncooked while we constantly kept requesting our grills to be fired up. Then the rice orders along with several other menu orders never showed up if it weren't for our constant nagging and subtle reminders. I mean, it's somewhat understandable that dropping in as a large group at 8:30 pm means the staff is probably dead tired and catering to our needs is probably the last thing on their minds--I get that. But is it too much to ask for proper service as good paying customers? Heck most of the sides we requested for were out, how could an AYCE KBBQ joint run out of potato salad--on the first round?!? Don't even get me started on hunting down our server for soda refills. Good thing the meat quality was okay and the staff, despite the subpar service are polite and apologetic about the inexplicably long delays--I'd never ding them for that.",

    "text": "I took the family here for late night dinner instead of the usual buffet. We all agreed that this was the right choice since there was no preparation, cooking or clean up. We also made sure not too dress too nicely since we knew we would be smelling like BBQ after all the table cooking we would have to do.  We arrived late 9ish thinking that Gen would be crowded like it normally is, but we were surprised that the place was not even half full. We still had to wait for almost 10 minutes since there was not enough servers. The queue behind us continued to grow but it was not until once the manager showed up and let us know we will only have until 45 minutes left to sit & eat and we told him we only 30 minutes. We were asked to seat then the clock was set. I guess they were closing early.  However, once we got seated we quickly made our choices but still had to wait for our waiter as he was still servicing his other tables. The policy of ordering the meats is only four meat dishes ordered at each round and you cannot order more than one of the same dishes. For the non-meat dishes, you can order at the same time as the meat without limits.  Together we finished off 18 orders of meats and seafood. Most of the pork and beef orders came out in roughly 2 strips each, calamari were one rectangle, shrimp was only five each time and the bulgogi came in a bowl. Overall the best dishes were the cajun pork belly, head on shrimp, Kalbi and the all pork belly varieties. We were bummed that they ran out of tongue. Overall the meats were easy to cook and the controls for the gas grill easy to modify at the end of the table.  The veggie plate was a joke with cuts of bell peppers, onions, zucchini and slices of corn on the cob. The japchae noodles were disappointing with the portion size and lack of meat. The tastiest non-meat dish was the fried dukboki with a sweet and sour sauce.   Service was efficient and each time the meat dishes were delivered the waiter took our next round of meat orders. The pace was slow initially but picked up once we got into the routine of cooking and eating.  Definitely worth a return visit.",

The menu is a bit different, same price though ($21.99). It does not have calamari steak but it does have small garlic marinated calamari. Gyozas, KFC Chicken (Orange chicken) and assorted vegetables - you could order all of one of them in my case mushrooms!   We went at an off time, which meant that they weren't that busy and the service was perfect. Quick, efficient, caring and helpful!  I honestly think I liked this location better.

As we went in, the dining area was upscale and up to date, more of a night club scenery. As for the food, it was very delicious! We ordered many dishes and cooked the way we wanted.

    "text": "Got treated like a KING by my fam at Gen Korean BBQ House on Father's Day!  After talking about it for months we finally paid a visit to Gen.  But...yeah, it was super busy for lunch on Father's Day!  No worries though, we still only waited 15 minutes or so for a table.  Is it just me, or is Gen reminiscent of some kind of dance club with lots of neon?  I personally found it very inviting - tables and seats were clean, the high ceilings helped to dissipate the endless amount of smoke coming from tables, heck - even the AC was ON!!  Some of these K-BBQ places...they let you burn while cooking your own food!  Gen was a nice change, comfortable manning the grill.  For the menu that day, since it was a holiday Gen was doing dinner menu all day.  But DAMN - their AYCE pricing is pretty on point!  $21.99 per person?  That's like a good $5-6 less than the competition!  They may not have the biggest AYCE menu compared to others, but you know me...I love a great deal!  Cheap is fine with me!  Apps included too!  Even with a tinier menu, the fam & I ate a ton of food:  *Gen Premium Steak (we had like 6 orders of this LOL) *Gen Beef Belly *Gen Beef Bulgogi *Gen Flat Iron Steak *Beef Tongue (seriously we ordered a TON of this, so melty) *Premium Pork Belly *Red Wine Pork Belly *Gobchang (yummy intestines) *Cheese Pork Cutlet (so tasty!) *Jap Chae (nice addition) *Crispy Cajun Chicken (spicy good) *K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken) *Soondoboo (spicy tofu stew) *Assorted banchan (with extra helpings of kim chee!)  A TON of food!  Really!  Don't even worry about the 2 hour time limit, we were near stuffed after like 50 minutes!  The quality of the meats were not like the fancy non-AYCE K-BBQ places, but none of us seemed to mind while we savored every bite.  The beef tongue was a favorite of the table too - the only issue we had is that only 4 thin slices come to your table per order.  We had to keep asking them to bring at least 4 orders (16 slices) to our table each time.  The Gen Premium Steak is a like cut of ribeye I believe, so it was rich everytime.  Delicious!  The apps were pretty good, our favorites were the Cheese Pork Cutlet (we ordered 2) and the Crispy Cajun Chicken.  Each person is allowed rice as well, but don't forget to ask!  Otherwise your meal will go rice-less.  Tip - if you like spicy, ask for a bowl of the Gen Special Sauce!  It's some kind of in-house made dipping sauce for their meats made with lots of garlic & jalapenos.  So good with their K-BBQ!  One thing I did notice with Gen is that you don't get a dessert to end your meal like other AYCE K-BBQ places do.  But I did not miss it one bit.  I believe I finished my meal with some Soondoboo and a side of intestines, HA!  Certainly was a great end to my Father's Day lunch!  For the value & variety of Gen Korean BBQ, I can easily say our fam will be back for another visit.  Mother's Day?  Birthday?  Probably almost any day!  GEONBAE!!",

No one asked me questions while I was chewing or interrupted while we were talking but they slipped in and out to clear our plates and give us refills often.   You cook your own meat, right at the table. Which was an adventure. I wouldn't recommend bringing granny toddlers as the grill is build into the table but my kids, age 4 and up didn't try to touch it.   The food was good. The ice cream was tasty and fun.",

    "text": "Gen is doing their job in joining the AYCE scene on Sahara. They have a great selection of meat on their menu.  At a price of $22pp is not bad at all, my main gripe is how they charge the kids by height.  My daughter is tall, but skinny and eats like a bird.  So buyer remorse just hit reality, it's the same feeling you get after you buy a car.  Tons of rolled brisket is always a hit at my house.  Hawaiian steak was the winner as the kids kept fighting over the one slice of pineapple.  So we had to order two more Hawaiian steak to make everyone happy.  Gen Signature Galbi for this price NICE!  Must order the onions and mushrooms, garlic, jalepenoes, and bean paste.  Tons of banchan and the service was amazing as my cup was never emptied.  What's most impressive is how fast the food came.  No complaints whatsoever.  Not my top place for kbbq, but ranks top three when compared to AYCE kbbq joints in town.",

Yet, I wanted to do just that on my birthday!  The atmosphere at Gen, had a cool vibe. The staff was very friendly, accommodating and the service was superb!  We were seated fairly quickly in a nice booth with a hot grill.  I explained to the waiter, this was our first time at any korean BBQ.  He explained how everything worked and he gave us some recommendations, such as starting off with gyoza, which was perfect!  The server took our order, our raw meat arrived at our table in about 2 minutes.  Then it was on like donkey Kong!    We grilled our meat and all the meats and the rest of the food was very tasty...I was impressed!  This AYCE was only $21.00 for dinner, not including drinks.  The time allotted to us was 2hrs, which was more than enough time!    All in all, I was very happy with my  experience at GEN and I will be back!!",

Our meats were brought to us quickly upon ordering and banchan replenishes were quick as well.  Our lead server was great with changing the grill and keeping everyone's drinks fresh.  All the staff in general had a upbeat and positive attitude, fantastic.  Gen BBQ: Everything we ordered was above average but the premium steak, bulgogi and pork stood out for so these received repeat orders.  The salad was really fresh and paired well with our meats.  The usual banchan side dishes were good but the servings were tiny.  I especially enjoyed their Jap chae noodles.  Ask your server create the Gen Dipping Sauce as it doesn't automatically come with your orders.  This is a delicious in house dipping sauce that I will request at future visits.  Gen Ambiance:  A large dining area smartly designed with multiple tables, booths to accommodate large crowds that are popular with ayce Korean BBQ.  The open room restaurant dimly lit with some great Tron blue accent lighting but you're eating area is well lit for dining.  At an initial glance, you could mistake this place as a high end cocktail lounge.  I frequent the Gen House in Green Valley which I enjoy and they're doing well with their newest location.  This is another great option in this great foodie city of Las Vegas and I'm sure i'll be back.  See you under the blue lights! =)",

    "text": "The best places are found spur of the moment.  My wife and I have been on a personal trek to find the best Korean BBQ.  Invariably, the services comes at a cost of ambiance or service.  Not so Gen.  they've stepped up their game by offering a massive 36 item menu for an AYCE - reasonably priced at $21.99.  Their premium steak is served in 12-16 oz cuts 1/2 in thick.  All the fixins you can expect from a Korean BBQ.  The ambiance is bathed in blue hues - we'll have to come back at night instead of dusk.  Service is over the top.  As you'll have guessed, I am impressed by the sixth sense good servers have - realizing before you do, that you've finished your pop or need a refill of bean paste.  Special mention goes out to Prince, who did just that.  Have I mentioned that their hosts announce party size and the line cooks cheer?    I recommend this place and give it 5 stars for service, ambiance, cleanliness, and for the delicious food.  We'll be back.  Update: Mothers Day dinner.  Consistency ranks high with me.  This place delivers.  Having worked through the food coma this place put me in last time, I was able to take my time with dinner - I'm ex-military, so I eat like it's my last day on earth with one plate I'm sharing with a fat kid.  The crew here is the envy of any 5-Star, Michelin rated establishment.  When was the last time I seen a cleanup guy really put some elbow grease to a particularly stubborn stain?  I did.  Tonight.  Everyone works.  In a full service restaurant, table turning is key.  The faster you can have an available table the greater it is in profits to the owners.  They trained their crew exceptionally well here.  I had the privilege of being part of a tightknit unit during a particularly exhausting mission.  We were on point.  Finish each other's sentence, already done, sixth sense on point.  These guys reminded me of that tonight.",

They didn't have a lot of the menu options that general Korean BBQ restaurants offer but at the same time they had a variety of other items on their menu for lunch that are not available at other Korean bbq restaurants. If you're looking for a spot that just gets that Korean barbecue craving out of your system then by all means, but overall this place would not be my number one spot to go to While in Vegas",

This was unfortunately my last meal while in Vegas, and I'm really disappointed I ended my trip at Gen. Gen in other cities are great, but I recommend going elsewhere if you're looking for a KBBQ place in Vegas (we tried Biwon when we first got to the city and liked it so I recommend trying there instead.)",

We ordered the AYCE and the food was average nothing spectacular but on par with most other decent Korean bbq places I've been to. Specific things to call out food wise: the shrimp was old and tasted off noticed we couldn't get the peel off easily which isn't usually a good sign. However the squid, and I don't even like squid was awesome!!! As was the beef short rib and the steak. Which my bf ordered 7 of bc surprisingly for the quality it's unlimited. That's different from most spots that only allow one order per person.   Overall nice experience and I'll be back",

Standout meats were the Hawaiian anything (pork belly, galbi, chicken) beef tongue, and brisket.",

We came to this place for a going away dinner so we had a fairly large party and I brought my kids. 9,8,5 and 2. I have to say it was quite pricey paying full price for my 9 and 8 year old who doesn't eat as much as a full grown adult. I also didn't get a high chair for my toddler so it made it hard for me to enjoy the experience. I would have given 5 stars but I was not happy with the cost for children.",

However today I came in with my five year old and three month old baby and four adults. I requested a table with two grills for two people had a seafood allergy & she told the manager. The manager walked back to the host stand and just stood there not acknowledging me or letting me know what's happening, then Before getting sat the hostess asked my son to stand at the line to see if he was 40\" to qualify for free dining. He was and the hostess confirmed. At the end when receiving our bill we were charged for two children all you can eat dinners. My son only ate a rice bowl and we thought he was free. But my three month old baby got charged for just sitting there. The manager had my son go back up to the front to see if he fits the height requirement and had an attitude when she saw he was. Bottom line, double check your bill when dining with children.",

The table was already set with some banchans, napkins, wooden chopsticks and salt. I don't know how long the Banchans were set but they were all dry and not appetizing. I ordered some side dishes which are all part of AYCE...Sunduboo, Gyoza and Japchae. There sundooboo was the least tasty soup I've ever had.  We ordered Gen's Prime steak, Bulgogi, Shrimp, Cajun Shrimp, Garlic Squid, and Spicy Octopus. Everything was ok and not so memorable.  All the staff we encountered were very professional and excellent with their service...But the food...not at all worthy of a visit. Maybe their dinner would be better?...but I don't think I will try to find out.",

It was relatively busy, but we were seated promptly at the BBQ house.  The decor and ambiance is amazing. It feels very laid back and relaxing. I was quite stunned at how modern the Korean BBQ house was inside. It's a all you can eat Korean BBQ House and you pay per person.   The service was pretty good for the most part. We had a few different waiters that came by the table to help us out - either for drinks, utensils, meats etc..   We ended up selecting a wide variety of beef first and then chicken.  -Steak -Gyoza -Beef Bulgogi [2] -Hawaiian Chicken -Garlic Chicken -Sweet & Spicy Chicken  We had our plates transitioned [3] times during the course while we were at the Korean BBQ. My boyfriend ended up cooking all of the meats, but still, the food was delicious and the experience is always a lot of fun! The cuts that was brought to our table was top-end. Even the chicken breasts that were marinated had barely any fat on the cutlets. I'm very impressed with the quality of meat that was served to our table to cook. I'll be back here again!!",

    "text": "I gotta admit AYCE KBBQ doesn't excite me much but if you're looking for quantity, this is your place.  Mass amounts of raw meat and endless plates of banchans may be the success for Gen Korea BBQ House. We decided to check this place out in the city known for indulgence before the dinner crowd on a Sunday night. The hostess escorted us to a booth full with blue neon lighting and plenty of customers already packing the heat on the grill.   As we sat down, the staff heated our grill in front of us and placed 8 different banchans to accompany with our selection of entrees. With a menu filled with 36 dishes, we were completely overwhelmed from the KBBQ meats and seafood. All of those dishes come raw and are cooked by your grill. Some of the other dishes such as the jap chae, gyoza, soondooboo comes out cooked to order.  We slowly paced ourselves and started off with the beef tongue, spicy chicken, spicy baby octopus and a few side dishes. Not long after placing our orders, the dishes were delivered and we began grilling it at our table. They served three different dipping dishes which were a bit too salty for my taste. All the dishes were seasoned enough and didn't need the additional sauces. The beef slices were decent and didn't exceed the fat content like many other restaurants who uses lower standard beef cuts. After an additional order, we completed our meal and the server looked at us with an odd expression. He said we were atypical and ordered below average quantities versus the other customers. To us, we believe in quality versus quantity.  After our meal, we skipped the next 1.5 days worth of eating due to all the MSG and sodium we ate. Overall, for $22 per person for AYCE Korean BBQ this is definitely worth your waistline.",

Most of the bon shon were good and the waiter was quick to replace any empty bowls and favorites we had. We enjoyed some bulgogi marinated meat 4/5, octopus 4/5, shrimp 4/5, brisket 4/5, and strip steak 5/5. Additionally we had some volcano chicken, extremely spicy but still good flavor.

I have loved these types of Korean BBQ places since my LA days in the 90s and I love it more that I live in city with so many choices on Korean BBQ.   I came to this location with a friend who had not tried Korean BBQ before. Right?!? I know!! So I figured that $21.99 would be a good starting point in case he did not like it, there would be little loss. Well, suffice it to say my friend LOVED IT! He kept ordering different items that I would not even eat, he was very experimental. Anyhow we have come here twice, my friend definitely likes the place.  This Gen location on Sahara I like better than the one in Henderson. I have been to the Gen in Henderson a couple times during lunch and I was just okay with it. The staff at the Sahara location are quick and friendly, very pleasant.  So if you are looking to try Korean BBQ for the first time and not spend a lot of money for it, this is a good place to go.",

    "text": "Vegas is absolutely FULL of K-BBQ places.  Some are all you can eat, some have better quality meat, some are \"hole in the wall.\"  Well, Gen is definitely an excellent K-BBQ experience.  The interior features a very cool and modern decor, and it was not busy at all later (around 9:30pm) on a Sunday evening.  When you arrive at your table you will find the assorted side dishes already in place for you to nibble on while you review the menu.  The menu is basically one all you can eat package, though, for $21.99.  There were about 37 items on the list ranging from assorted meats to tofu soup to gyoza dumplings to more.  You can order as much as you want to, and there is no limit to the Kalbi as there sometimes is at other places.  Soft drinks are served with unlimited refills which is a nice touch as you enjoy the various meats since you'll get thirsty.  Service was excellent!  Empty plates never sat more than a couple of minutes, and servers were always asking what else we wanted to order.  You will grill the meats yourself at your table unlike other places where the staff will come to your table and cook it.  Personally, I like the \"cook it yourself\" option as you can do it at your own pace without a staff member awkwardly reaching around your party to grill meat.  We ordered a large variety of meats.  The quality was quite good for an all you can eat place.  I liked the Hawaiian steak which was nicely marinated and served with a pineapple slice.  The Kalbi was also excellent.  Flavorful and, while not as sumptuously tender as I've had in the past, very good for an all you can eat place.  And, you can have as much as you want.   Overall, this was an excellent choice for all you can eat, and for $21.99 person the price is also excellent!",

Then we had macaroons for him and the waitress put a candle on it for him and we sang happy birthday. Flavors were strawberry, coffee, green tea, and mango. Everything was delicious and service was excellent!  It's a fairly large Korean bbq restaurant nicely decorated. Excellent food! We will be back again.",

Gen is just like most other Korean BBQ restaurants in that it serves what most other KBBQ joints serve. My first thoughts walking in were focused on how cool the interior design was. The lights were dim, the chairs were high, and there were small hints of neon lights around every corner. Almost felt like I was in the club. A little more fancy than other KBBQ places I've been to. What I really liked here was the super fast service. As soon as we put an order in, it was out within a few minutes! For some reason their clear noodles (japchae) was ridiculously good. Such a simple side dish, but man I couldn't stop eating it. I also enjoyed the fact that they had cute little macaron ice cream sandwiches as an option for dessert.",

Kaithlyn definitely took care of us and kept checking in. She was very friendly, attentive, and had great customer service. Highly recommend.",

Our server was phenomenal and got us everything we needed impossibly fast, and was beyond friendly. Although there were so many of us, we were never neglected and all our orders came correctly. I definitely recommend the beef belly, Hawaiian pork belly, and Korean fried chicken! Can't wait to come back!",

We do prefer the this location to the Sunset one.  We have always been seated immediately. The lunch is $17 per person and dinner is $21. I don't find that the difference in dinner price is worth it, unless you looove short ribs. There are obviously other differences in the menus but to me, it isn't worth it.   The quality of meats are always delicious. We eat the ENTIRE time we are there. Our friend is an amazing cook, he's usually the one to cook. Since he knows what he's doing, we cook and eat very quickly so we consume a lot of meat.   We always order premium steak, beef bulgogi, and pork cheek. It's not a lot of variety but we order a lot of each.   The service is great. They are quick to refill our drinks, take our orders, and change our grills. Even when we are on our 10th order of premium steak, they still bring it out quickly. We have never had any issues with any of our orders or the service.   Bottom line: If you like Korean BBQ and want AYCE, I definitely recommend them!",

However, for their price point, i didn't mind that they didn't have some of my favorites. I do love that they have tofu soup and japjae on their menu!  Their desserts are basic unless you want to buy an ice cream macaroon sandwich (I'm not a fan of but they're cute and yummy). I know everyone comes for the Korean bbq but sometimes you just want a good dessert to top off dinner lol.   Overall, i think Gen is a very successful franchise bbq spot. I don't exactly understand the hype but it's a well rounded spot that has good customer service and ambiance. I'm all about consistency and quality when it comes to ANY all you can eat spots. Vegas is getting more and more saturated with Korean bbq spots but I'd definitely recommend checking Gen out if you're in the area.",

Neon lights, beautiful upholstery, staff with a smile on their face. Great indicators and atmosphere settings for the start of a great meal!  AYCE was great and definitely affordable. I didn't check if there was WiFi, although dinner was so fun I didn't bother checking my phone once. There's no bike racks or outdoor dining area. Bathrooms are gender specific and clean.  Staff was on point. My server was a little unfriendly, although the bussers and other servers were nice. They checked on my table frequently to change my grill and to see if I needed anything. They did a great job! The only reason I didn't give this spot 5 stars was because of my server being a little rude and clumsy while grabbing empty plates or placing items on the table.  Overall, I'd definitely return to this restaurant. Walking in, there's lots of space for seating. It looks like a nightclub with Korean grills placed ever so well. Grills are hot and new. Very clean place. Affordable price. There's dessert for a separate purchase after you eat. Complimentary candy while you pay for your bill. Great KBBQ spot that gives you the bang for your buck!

Also, rather than having one server we had about 5 different people approaching asking if we were in need of anything or wanted refills and all of them unsure if someone else had already asked so it was a bit much and disruptive. otherwise, very good and fairly priced.",

Prior to these guys showing up in the Vegas valley all that you would ever hear from ex-Californians was \"OMG you have to try Gen\" \"Gen is the best KBBQ place ever!!\" Honestly to me it's the in-and-out nostalgia complex defined.   BUT I will say the following statements: The Gen product is consistent across their chains; the Vegas locations are on par with the Tustin, CA location.  Gen provides a environment that's comfortable and appealing to wehgukin/baeg-in. Meaning that the customer service what you expect from a standard restaurant in America (using Asian bias standard for all restaurants).   They provide a solid spread of Bon-Chon and are very prudent in ensuring that your little dishes never run empty.   The cooked dishes are OK however nothing to write in detail about. It's hard to write overflowing adjectives about the KFC and gyoza. Both are ok but not what you come here for. The main event here is the meat. First and foremost +1 star on the fact that they have Kalbi on their AYCE menu. Most KBBQ places either charge extra for Kalbi or limit it to one order.  The cuts of the meat are good quality the Chadol (brisket), Samgyubsal (pork belly) and Hangjungsal(pork jowls) are some of my standard favorites and were top notch.  The saucy meats: Beef Bulgogi, Kalbi and Spicy Pork were very good as well.  My suggestion is to starts with the unsauced meats and then do the saucy stuff; this way your taste buds are not killed from the Gochujang if you are not used to it.   For those who are just venturing into Korean foods, Gen is a good starting point to get introduced to the flavors w/o getting yelled at by an Ajima or getting blown away by the power of Gochujang.  Enjoy the wait for this place; it's worth it (as long its less than a 1/2 hour).",

    "text": "GEN! I loved going to Gen when they were still in SoCal. They used to have unmarinated short ribs and it was so delicious. Then they switched suppliers and they no longer carried the unmarinated short ribs so I stopped going as much. Then they came to Vegas but they were in Henderson and that was far. But they are pretty much the cheapest AYCE BBQ in Vegas at $21.99 per person. And now that they have opened up on Decatur and Sahara, they are much closer and maybe we can go more often!  Came here on Thursday night for dinner with my husband and some friends after my friend told us about their soft opening. Their establishment is pretty big with similar layouts to their Henderson location and Cali locations. What we did notice is that some tables, they have a hood for ventilation while other tables, their vent was on the sides of the grill.   We ordered a bunch of their beef tongue and beef belly. They were really delicious. Just be sure not to overcook them or the meat will get tough. We also got their pork belly, brisket, steak, hawaiian, steak, bulgogi, japchae, and some other things.   Everything was pretty good. Meat was decent. The japchae was so-so .. I've had better japchae at other places. It's still nice to have though so you won't be eating meat the whole time. There's salad as well. Unfortunately, they don't have the rice paper side dish yet since they are in soft opening. Though, honestly, I wouldn't count them having it all the time regardless of soft opening or grand opening cause their Henderson location doesn't always have it.   Service was pretty good. They didn't have a limit on how much you can order, which is fantastic. They used to limit you to four a few years back but now they don't! The meats got delivered super fast but who knows if that'll stay that way.   They were actually supposed to open earlier. They were working on getting some disposable grill plates for the grills since they are really hard to clean. They figured that it may be easier for them to just dispose it after it's been used. However, the problem with disposable grills is that it causes a lot of smoke when you use it. And because of that, they couldn't pass the health department with it. In the end, they had to scrap that idea and go along with the traditional grills.   If Gen could get the adjustable hoods like the ones in Korea or the ones at Hobak and Doh, it would be so much better. Even though the establishment is brand new, their ventilation is horrible. Normally, a place takes a while for it to stink up with BBQ smell but I walked out smelling like some grilled short ribs and keep in mind that they are still in soft opening!",

    "text": "I have always been a huge fan of Gen. I have lost count of how many times I've been here over the past 2 years and I have never had a bad experience. The wait times are sometimes annoying but it is always worth it for the food. Unfortunately this last time I went made me question whether I should go back again. This past time I went I was with a party of 10, which of course is a large party so we knew we were going to have to wait a while. The wait time the hostess gave us was 45 minutes. Which we though was great. We had also asked her to not split up our party since I know sometimes they do that with larger parties. She assured me we would not be split up. After waiting 45 minutes we asked the hostess how much longer she thought it was going to be, and she pointed at a large group at a table and said she was going to seat us at that large table and that the guests at the table were paying and then leaving. She said it would me no more than 20 minutes. We waited another 30 minutes and watched the staff clear that table, then they called our names after waiting for a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes. When she walked us in she walked us to a different table that the other hostess said we were waiting on and tried to split us up into 3 different tables, which is something I had asked them not to do since the beginning. I voiced my frustration and after speaking to the manager she reluctantly moved us to the table we waited an extra 30 minutes for.   Once we were seated the food and service was exceptional as always. It just really bothered me that they had us wait an extra 30 minutes on top of the 45 originally and told us they were putting us at one specific table that we waited the extra 30 minutes for then put us at another table that was open the whole time!   I probably will not be coming back to this location, instead I will go back to the original Las Vegas Gen at Galleria Mall.",

The menu was all you can eat and like most all you can eat places they will charge extra if you do not eat everything. We started.off with the Hawaiian Pork Belly, Gen Bulgogi (korean beef), and the Korean Fried chicken(KFC) which was already cooked and similar to Chinese Orange Chicken. The Hawaiian Pork Belly was awesome. We liked it so much we had a second order. The Bulgogi was good  also. We ordered Garlic Chicken and the Briskett next along with some vegetables. The Briskett was extremely thin and cooked really fast. It was goid but I thought needed more seasoning. The Garlic Chicken was also good but I'm from Hawaii and Hawaiian garlic chicken is much better than it was here.   Overall the atmosphere was great and the reataurant was very clean. The service was really good.One of the best service I have experienced in Vegas. I definitely would reccomend this place to friends.",

I told her that we were there for less than one hour and she said she will check since they clock everyone.  I told her you better!  She came back later and apologize in a very quick fashion!  Good thing that our server Neil came and did a better job of apologizing- I did tell him that I was really offended by that lady's action - only to find out that she was a manager... Wow I don't think I will pass her as a manager!  She definitely needs retraining in customer service!!!! And my advice, if you are to eat here check your watch for the time!!!!",

My fav items include the marinated short ribs, premium top sirloin steak, brisket, cajun calamari, cajun shrimp, and premium pork belly.   Clubby atmosphere. It's loud and dark with electro music playing in the background. A downside for me personally to this place is that it doesn't have the authentic feel of a Korean bbq joint. I didn't see any Korean workers, and you have to ask for a lot of the little things like sesame oil, samjang, garlic, etc.   In the end, $22 for all the variety of meats makes this place worth it.",

Then we got the volcano, which was unnecessarily spicy. Not worth getting. The gyoza was solid.  We got the brisket, which when they brought out looked very different than the second time they brought it out. Kind of confusing- overall we ordered five orders of brisket and two looked very different and tasted worse.  Spicy bulgogi (pork) was very yummy. Corn cheese when you ask, so good! They offer chicken, which is very cool for people who don't eat pork or beef.  The meat was pretty low quality but for 22$ and all you can eat, that's to be expected. However, the service was great and the line wasn't too long on a Friday night, so overall a very nice experience.",

George was our serve but a few other servers helped us out as well Kaithlyn I believe was one. They all work together and I love that cause it helps give you the best experience.   The food here is always delicious. From the salad to all the appetizers and the meats. Our favorites are the chadol (beef belly), the beef brisket and beef bulgogi. We always get extra brisket sauce and salad dressing sauce to dip our meats and gyozas in.   We often come during lunch because it's such a great deal. It's only $16.99 for all you can eat which is awesome, we get around 8 plates of meat for the both of us usually and come out more than satisfied.   I'm so glad they built this location, it's a lot closer to us and local to anyone that comes to the strip. We live up north and it's so much nicer to drive only like 30 minutes vs an hour to the Henderson location.",

Everything was good but I have had better.  The kids and I also got a macaroon icecream sandwich each.  For me the best part was the service all the waiters were very attentive and they changed out our grill two times.  When we ordered the meat would come out in about a minute or two.  So quick.  Also the water cups were never empty and they had the Stanley Cup Playoffs showing on all television screens. #GoKnightsGo!",

Can't beat the price $21.99 for ayce and they serve it to you,  no need to get up and get your own food.. The quality and flavors are on point! I pretty much enjoyed everything we ordered.. Spicy baby octopus was my favorite, all the meat tasted fresh and well seasoned.. There was a manager there that was very accommodating and welcoming,  she made sure our meal was exceptional!! Along with all the servers they provided excellent service.. Sorry I didn't catch any names... I will definitely come here more often for my kbbq fix!! Good job Gen keep up the good work!!",

No disappointments though since we knew what to expect and always enjoy the food at any Gen KBBQ. The only downfall is that they don't served steamed egg which I enjoy with my KBBQ. Anyway, the price is reasonable since it's an AYCE joint and the food is good. Nothing out of the ordinary here - just a delicious KBBQ dinner!",

We checked with a waiter and he said we don't use oil here. Excuse me ? With out oil do you guys know how hard to cook meat? 2. Each time I must call by myself if I would have a services. No buddy helps cook and no buddy coming. 3. Food like fast food, come on.   And yes , the price is really good. But I won't come again",

One of the waiters who is a Caucasian male wearing glasses gave us a huge attitude when we asked for an extra bowl of rice. He even gave one of my friends a dirty look.  Sad that it's such a good place with great food, only for the waiters to be so unfriendly and lacking in customer service mannerisms.

Meats are pretty average quality. Satisfying for our palate. Will always enjoy korean food because of their meat options and side dishes. Theyir first location began in Henderson next to Galleria mall. Being new, they had <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmore.menu&s=b9ea73b03f2012f44d09f7333a21e05f98ece3d5313f26201bf9fdebfb67dd1b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more.menu</a> items and through time, it decreased. It was nice for them to have appetizer options. My fave was their fried calamari topped with sriracha/mayo sauce. They no longer serve appetizers that as it might've been a budget issue. Don't exactly know. Other than that, meats are marinated well, boasting of flavor. Our usual is beef bulgogi, galbi (short ribs), smoked garlic pork belly, premium steak ribeye, and shrimp. Their chicken options are great also it's just I don't have much patience cooking it, takes longer than beef. Drinks are additional charge on top of ayce price. Sahara location isn't far. If your visiting Vegas, it's conveniently in the middle. Main landmark is Palace Station, head west to Decatur on Sahara, look left then you got AYCE KBBQ!",

This time seated within 5 minutes while they turned over a table. Jade my server was very good. She kept me well-stocked. You can order off a menu of meat smogasborg of around 36 items for dinner. My favs are the galbi and brisket. The belly and steak are thick and take awhile to grill. Red wine pork belly, beef tongue, spicy bulgogi were great. The beef intestines were chewy. Iam adventurous with food but I didn't like those innards. I tried the prawns and baby octopus which were the main seafood items. Anyways, I ate until my heart was content. The kimchi and the sides were nothing to write home about. They also give you 3 dipping salts. I ask for their excellent house spicy sauce. Service at this Vegas location is really good. My 1st visit was one of the top 10 best ever service I have ever experienced. They tag team so any server or helper will drop by and check on you. This visit they checked on me often but in August I had 3 asking if I needed my grill changed or to order more off the menu in like a few minutes. Amazing service during my summer visit. I saw Gen has a few Bay Area locations and they have Yelp reviews with poor service. Not likely at this Vegas location. Not sure about the Henderson location but reviews look like service is good there too. I hit up Gen each time going to Vegas now. A great new tradition!!",

    "text": "This was my first visit to this establishment. Korean barbecue is one of my favorite cuisines in Atlanta so I was super excited to try this out in Vegas. We drove past it the day before and I was told that it was a pretty popular spot so we decided to try it today.  Immediately upon walking in I was impressed with the decor of the restaurant.  It is very modern and has an upscale ambiance. For some reason it reminds me of the W Hotel, probably because of the blue lights LOL   When I first entered it took a while for them to turn around and greet me but once I was seated and our server came everything was great. They have an all-you-can-eat menu for $21.99 each. The menu stated there are 36 different items to choose from, we stuck with the beef bulgogi which is my favorite (because I like marinated meats), so we had several servings of that. We also ordered the an order of the vegetables and mushrooms, Hawaiian steak, and Hawaiian chicken. All of the marinades were very delicious and I was very impressed. They had most of the usual side dishes that you'll find such as salads, radish, kimchi, potato salad, pickled cucumber and even coleslaw.  I ate a whole bowl of a potato salad LOL   The service was very prompt and the servers were very attentive. The other servers would stop by and check on us as they pass by even though they weren't are assigned waiter. I always love going to restaurants like that so you don't have to sit and wait on one particular person. I think every restaurant should do this.  My overall experience was very good, I definitely will be back again. My only gripe is, the meal didn't include a dessert, which most Korean barbecue at least give you coffee or a small ice cream or something (there's a separate charge). I give it an overall 4 stars would recommend you try it out.",

    "text": "Friendly, clean, and not too smoky spot for Korean BBQ. Our server Austin was on point and made sure we were taken care of. He suggested some good soju and meats to start the evening.  We started with the odds and ends first. Intestines and tongue were good, but needed quite a bit of cooking time. The volcano chicken was not as spicy as I thought it would be, but was one of my favorites. The ribs were a definite hit too. Andrew the bartender made a tasty and pretty soju mojito. Banchans (side dishes) were refilled frequently which was nice. Dinner service got busier later in the evening causing a slight delay in our table getting the meats we ordered, so some of the table mates were a little hungry in between orders.   Lastly, for large groups, you can only split the check 3 ways. They can take 2 different credit cards and the third payment would be cash for the remainder of the balance. Which made math time extra fun after we had a round of drinks, but we figured it eventually. Overall, decent bbq, good service, and cool atmosphere.",

    "text": "AYCE: I have to say, for the price at the time that we went (dinner) $22.00 approximately per person with over 35 items to choose from and all-you-can-eat in a clean and modern environment, I was really impressed.  If you've seen any of my other KBBQ reviews, you know I am a sucker for Kalbi mainly LA-Kalbi.  Here they have Gen signature kalbi which is not too bad.  It is not as tender as going to other a la carte KBBQ restaurants but since they do not limit you on how many you can order, I was just impressed with the overall experience.  Perhaps you can choose to grill the kalbi more on the rare side for a more tender mouth feel.  But I did enjoy the 'tae-jee buhlgogi' spicy pork a lot and the chadol=brisket was adequate so long as you don't overcook it and use the dipping sauce.  There were other great choices like a huge bowl of japchae noodles and a simple but yummy sunduboo tofu soup.  Not to mention ppan-jhan side dishes were refillable.  Service-wise: they were for the most part very attentive and fountain beverages were refillable not commonly seen in Asian restaurants.  There is music but despite other reviews it wasn't obnoxiously loud.  I'd definitely go back if I want an affordable KBBQ that can accommodate a variety of taste buds.  BTW, I braved the Volcano chicken contrary to the WARNING on the menu.  It is a slow burn that can get you over time but when you have some Korean blood in you I think you'll be ok like I was (wink!)  But try it, there isn't much to lose.  I wish it had more chicken and less breading.  This is a great treasure here in Las Vegas's \"china town\"",

This could have been totally avoided if they sat smaller groups at the respective small booths, but for some reason they don't do that.  It was frustrating to see a couple eating at the \"large seating section\" meant for larger groups.      No sense of urgency.  This is ironic as this restaurant has a time limit. It takes too long for the wait staff to refill drinks, take more orders, bus tables and generally speaking, tend to customers.  We had to write a list down of \"refill soda, more X, Y, Z, extra spoon, etc\" because the time in between a waiter checking on us was a rare occasion and the list of things needed kept growing.  Hiring a few extra workers would do this place wonders.",

Our server explained to us how it worked since it was my boyfriend's first time. The plates of meat that we ordered came immediately. There was enough meat per plate for 2-4 people, depending on what you order. The servers were prompt when it came to changing out the grill during our meal. I loved that the macaroon ice cream sandwich was in a fridge for us to look at right when we entered. Made me excite to get dessert as it was delicious and not to sweet. The atmosphere was well lit even though it was dim lighting with cool blue lights. They were waiting to get their liquor license for their bar. We will return once that happens. The service was great! Favorites: Cajun shrimp, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), chicken with fondue jalapeno dip, thumbs up that had the ribs and #1, the mushrooms and I liked the green tea salt. Not sure if Korean BBQ places do fish, but I felt that's all that would've been a nice choice. Great place for groups or a date. BTW, they have a couple of TVs at the bar if your special someone wanted to catch up on sports.",

So We were so happy to find out that they have just opened up a second location in West Las Vegas. But first huge disappointment was a terrible ventilation system. Unlike the henderson location it was \"\"really smoky,,\"\" secondly maybe because its a fairly new place, the service wasn't that great, my waiter forgot to bring few items from the first order, we ordered soju but he forgot to bring shot glasses(??) then we asked someone else for the shot glasses after a quite long wait, then he brought us tall beer glasses :-(( My favorite appetizers at Henderson location wasn't on the menu anymore (Crispy spicy Rice cake, Fried Squid legs) Very good quality of beef tongue, ok pork belly, ok galbi, very good K.F.C. (Korean Fried Chicken)..No doubt it's a still decent dining spot for the price but we are not sure if we ever go back again because of their bad ventilation system and they don't offer my favorite appetizers anymore.",

We were served at first by Jay Ar ans he did a fantastic job, we loved his sense of humor, but he had to go to lunch and that is when we were served by Caylin Tran, yet another superstar in GEN. Thank you for your great service and awesome, delicious food!!!!",

Me and my bf been in Gen 3 times and its ALWAYS A GREAT EXPERIENCE for us.  I love the ambiance its spacious and the contemporary and modern design made it look expensive but really its very affordable, the quality of the meat i love how the brisket is thinly cut (personal preference). The taste of the marinated meats is well balance. They also have a bar!! Yay  Customer service i love it! The smile on their faces it made me feel welcome i dont care if its fake smile or what, they check on us often if we needed anything and everyone seems to be so friendly and approachable i just hope this will never change guys this is my new favorite korean bbq now  Props to our server tonight MIZZO and the hostess (sorry forgot her name) and the other staff for giving us wonderful customer service everytime, highly recommended this place everyone if you wanna try something different than the norms.",

They do apply a 18% gratuity for a party of that size, which was no problem but that means the server can lack service and they will still get almost a 20% tip. The reason for my review being 3 stars was they had barely any vegetarian options. I had to eat glass noodles (10/10) and peppers, onions and mushrooms for $21, which was there all you can eat price. My family, who eat meat, seemed to enjoy it but vegetables and noodles did not fill me up. I was hoping they had tofu, but nope. If I was a meat-eater, this place would have been better, very cool idea. Also, ventilation of this restaurant was bad, left the restaurant REEKING of bbq smoke. NOT VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY.",

(asked for rice 3 times, salt twice, and gave up trying to refill banchan) also tends to confuse things (asked the green salt, gived me reg salt and sesame oil instead... k.)   annoying issues. fix up your ventilation. it gets so smoky in there it almost looks like fog during peak times.   also. no rice paper. sad face.",

This last time we had Anthony as our waiter and he was very kind and continually checked on us throughout. The meats were great and the Galbi and the spicy pork was the favorite. Food comes out very quickly and they ask to change the grill plate a few times. Sides were pretty standard, but limited in comparison to other AYCE places. There aren't any extra appetizers available or desserts included so that's the main reason for the star loss. You can order a macron ice cream sandwich for like $3.50 extra? The place is huge so the wait is minimal, which is a big bonus for us! Customer service has always been on point, which is a big reason we have been back a few times.",

We asked to be moved and felt like we were being punished. They seated us by the kitchen door and we were lucky if anyone came to ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. We had dishes on the table that needed to be taken away and sat at the edge of the table table for 15 minutes before I was finally able to flag someone down.

The wine pork belly looked and tasted like literal crap. I don't understand how they can charge for any of this?? The service from our non-server, Austin, was the only amazing part. I think our server thought he was working in a Chinese restaurant because he said \"I don't read Chinese\" when we accidentally pointed at the Korean portion of the menu.. he was always not really around which was unimpressive because the other table's servers were around a heck of a lot more. Also, we asked to change the meat pan and he threw away pieces of our meat without asking if we wanted it.. this was our first course so we were pretty freaking starved after waiting for an hour after they told us it was a 30-45 min wait.. Everything we ordered was appalling. I cannot believe I wasted my calories and money on such mediocre food.. it makes me so sad!! My friend said \"it was edible..\", but I disagree.. I forced myself to eat it with copious amounts of sauce on everything.. that is a disgrace to my Korean heritage.. I'm sorry, mother.",
