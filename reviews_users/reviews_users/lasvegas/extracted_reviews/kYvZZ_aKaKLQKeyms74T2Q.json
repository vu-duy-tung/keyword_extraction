    "text": "I've heard good things about this place from a few people so after attempting to try frank and fina's Mexican Cocina (which was closes when I gt there) I decided to travel across the street to get my Mexican food fix taken care of.   Decor is nice, authentic and the service was mediocre. Waiter was polite but it was one of those feelings like he was smiling his ass off through his teeth, hiding his horrible day and unhappiness.   I'm not sure if this is a complaint but.. their menu selection made cheesecake factory's look like in-n-out's. Just.. Wayy too much. Strange that I'm talking about this but I had to tell the waiter about 4 times that I needed \"just another minute\". I ended up ordering a combination plate of a wet, enchilada style carnitas burrito, corn tamales and chile releteno. My friend ordered a chicken fajita plate.   When I took a bite of my burrito, I felt as if they had microwaved something bought out of a supermarket. The temperature was way off, there were many parts of the inside that were barely room temperature. The tamale was bland, and the chile reletno was mediocre. My friends chicken fajita didn't even come out sizzling. He also said it was cold and the chicken was very dry.   Would have gave a 2 star if the service was great and the prices were reasonable, but at almost $20 per person after tax and tip I was left extremely dissatisfied.  Maybe the other original location can do it right.",

I love Lindo and I have never had a bad expirience like I did Yesterday.6/11/2015 I normally go to the one on Centennial hills and I always have great expirience with great cutomer service. Let me begin with the fact that the beans had no taste the soup was cold... and by cold I mean Cold... Their customer service sucked , seemed like they were in a rush or something , they only had like 4 other families . I asked for Fish Ceviche.. ( i know how ceviche is made) This ceviche was disgusting .. I normally dont complain when something tastes bad. But I couldnt eat this . It has a nasty bitter taste .. as if the lemons had gone bad .. when limons arent fresh they get some type of yucky taste , and the limon the fish was marinated in was horrible. When I told the waiter about the taste he said thats how ceviche is made... I told him i know that ceviche is marinated in lemon but the limons are bad. I dont think he understood. He went to speak to the cheff. came back with a \"NEW\" plate and when i tasted it ... it was exactly the same but with more salt. (Guys you need fresh  limons.). I didnt say anything at all . I simply didn't eat it. They didnt apologize , didnt say anything . I  most definitely wont be going to this location Ever. I will stick to the one on Centennial Hills..  The only reason i gave 1 star was because i liked the candy they have in the front.",

The rice & beans were probably their best thing on the menu... usually I would turn back the food I didn't like for something else but gave up after eating a bite from the rest of my friends dishes. Also smelled like rotting fish + bleach? How they manage to pay their rent is what really boggles my mind.   Their only saving grace is the quality of customer service. Poor things can't be held liable for this venue's overrated kitchen staff based on the original Lindo Michoacan.",

We disagreed on which was the better one (so really the house margaritas here are delicious... and there's only a 2 dollar difference). Fresh tortilla chips, bean dip and salsa are complimentary and the baskets/bowls never get close to empty before being promptly replaced. We ordered fresh guacamole which was made at our table to our liking. We also ordered the carnitas with the coca-cola sauce on the side. The sauce was very sweet so I'm glad we had the choice of how much to put onto our food but it was delicious. Overall I left feeling satisfied and almost stuffed (I definitely take advantage of the chip refills). One of the better Mexican restaurants in town but a little pricey.  On a side note: I have also heard great things about Lindos on Flamingo and Hualipi just west of the 215.",

This time we received a 1/4 of the bowl full of  salsa (barely enough to dip your chips in), the beans were tepid, but the chips were great! We asked for more salsa and it was delivered directly from the fridge. The main course was equally disappointing. We both had the taco plates (beef and steak). The rice was molded on our plate (cafeteria style) along with bean puree vs. refried beans. The taco meat was completely void of taste. We added cold salsa and salt and pepper to the taco meat for some type of flavor enhancement. We are so disappointed, this was our favorite mexican food restaurant, and so convenient too. If your tying to reduce food costs, I get it, but don't serve premade ice-cold salsa and cafeteria molded rice. We like the authentic that Lindo did so well before.",

The bad thing was with the food....My hubby had the Arrachera meat which was hard, dry and stiff he had a hard time even pulling it apart, his corn tortillas were not good, and the beans seemed to be from a can or something...I know my beans...Yes, I'm Mexican and a great cook according to every single person that has ever tasted my food..    As for me, well I had the Carnitas platter with the flour tortillas....The carnitas were stiff, over fried pieces of pork meat, and dry also...So was I dissapointed  \"YES\"...The good thing was the salsa had OK taste and the Flour Tortillas were GREAT I know they are hand made because I make some a few times a week at home myself.  So I gave 1 star for place being nice including the server, and the other for the salsa and tortillas....but ok...After paying 70 dlls for good flour tortillas and salsa ONLY...I figure I could have made my tortillas for about 2.00 at home and a good salsa for another 2.00.  HMMM...maybe I should think about opening a REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant myself. :-)",

I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking, so that got me tipsy in a few minutes. The menu had a good selection of dishes - not your typical Mexican restaurant menu.  I settled on the Torta de Pierna (Roast Pork Mexican Sandwich), served with a heaping helping of french fries -  the first time I've seen french fries in a Mexican restaurant! I ate everything on the plate. Lol, the busboy even commented that I almost ate the plate! Good sandwich. Veruka ordered the Beef Chimichanga. She only ate half then said she was full - geez, I can't take this chick anywhere! ;-)  At some point in time,  I want to come back to try the other dishes on the menu.",

There are always leftovers for the next day's lunch.  We always get the table-side guacamole, which i would recommend regulating the amount of ingredients the servers mix in.  Some of the servers just dump a whole bowl of onion, one of tomatoes, and another of jalapenos into the mix.  It should just be a touch of each of those.  I sat outside on our last visit and it was very pleasant.  Inside is a little more typical, but still nice.   Food update:  I didn't like the Chile Verde as I found it too sour.  But I did have the Chile Relleno, and I recommend!  They use Pasilla Chiles (i'm purdy sure), and nice creamy cheese that mixes well with the enchilada sauce that its covered in.  The sauce is almost as good as mine! (almost.)    I generally disagree with the other comments about service.  I have generally had very good luck and received extremely friendly service.",

    "text": "We came here on Superbowl Sunday which happened to be nice and quite. I was extremely grateful for that!   We started off with the fresh Guacamole dip ($8.25). It is my favorite way to start a Mexican meal! I like the fresh pieces of jalapeno, tomato, onion and a squeeze of lime. I love when  my guacamole has a thick and chunky consistency. This was delicious!   My main dish was the Camarones Abuelito Timo. It was plump Gulf shrimp stuffed with cheese, peppers and wrapped in bacon and deep fried. It was good but not great because it was little bit too salty for me. I had to peel off some of the bacon to make it a little less salty.   I saw that they had a Tres Leche Cake on their dessert menu but they ran out! We settled on a cheesecake that tasted similar to the Tres Leche but it wasn't my favorite. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake but it still tasted decent.",

    "text": "Short version: horrible service, inedible food and nonexistent management.   And for those of you who are bored enough to read the long version, here we go! We came for dinner on a Saturday night after spending the whole day at the Highland Games and we were both starving. Thank goodness for the chips, salsa and small cup of soup cause I seriously would have been famished after we left.   I ordered the Tia Esther, a grilled chicken dish with a sauce that was described as dried chilies, secret spices and blended with a touch of mayonnaise. I like grilled chicken, I like dried chilies, I like spices (secret or otherwise) and I like mayo...on paper it sounds like a good dish. On paper. I literally had three bites of the chicken. The second two bites were just to make sure I was tasting it correctly and my guy had a bite. It was seriously like taking a bite out of a salt lick. To the point that it was inedible. I almost never send back a dish or even complain. I usually convince myself it's my fault for picking a dish I didn't enjoy. This time I couldn't stay quiet. My boyfriend could barely even swallow the bite he had.   We flagged down our server (since he never came to check on us after the plates hit the table) and explained what was wrong (at this point I was chalking it up to an accidental over salting incident) and he said he would have them remake it and package it to go. He wasn't apologetic or even kind about the situation. Twenty five minutes later he comes to the table drops the bag with my refire  in it on the table, throws the check on the table and disappears...never to return. First of all, if I had known it was going to take that long I would have said never mind, especially since we weren't able to flag him down until after my guy was done with his meal so we just sat there twiddling our thumbs. Secondly, don't be a turkey when someone is unhappy, especially when said person is almost in tears from guilt and apologizing to YOU for the inconvenience.   So basically we paid $16 for a side of beans and rice and free chips and a small cup of free soup. I'm not a happy panda.   If you think this sad tale is over, think again! I go to heat up my refired dish. Our server snarkily (I believe I just made that word up lol) pointed out that I must not like salty food so he did me a favor by packaging the sauce separately from the chicken. I'm the girl who asks for extra salt on my soft pretzels so that dog don't hunt bucko. I had high hopes that this batch would be better, I was still holding out hope that it was a mistake the first time, but lo and behold, the chicken was super salty, the sauce was super salty and together they were inedible again. I tried to do some kitchen magic by making a cream sauce to hide the chicken in and that didn't even help.   We asked for a manager to stop by our table, he never showed. The only time I saw the manager he was joking and talking with employees. I'm extremely unhappy, not only about the food but by the service and lack of empathy. In the past we have had decent meals at this establishment, but not even the soup (which is the main draw for me) will bring me back unless management reaches out to us and offers an apology.",

I usually order enchiladas at any Mexican place and decided to try their mole enchiladas with Steak. When my plate arrived I couldn't even find the enchiladas because there was a gigantic piece of well seasoned carne asada on top that was so amazing! Needless to say, portions were huge. We got to-go boxes and it felt like we barely touched our food even though we pigged out. The only disappointment were the churros for dessert which were nothing special, just the typical street fair kind and I suggest that they improve on this. All the Fine Mexican restaurants have home made churros on their menu accompanied with dipping sauces. Not so here. A minor detail, but I'll let it slide and will definitely be back soon!",

My carne asada tacos were so bland and the rice and beans so ordinary that I could'nt believe it. My wife's  vegetable fajitas were greasy and unappealing. Clearly this restaurant is doing what other top rated Mexican restaurants are guilty of: get popular, raise your prices and fail at the quality of food served. What a shame. Also, the organic margarita priced at $13 was ridiculous. Sorry guys, I'm done with you. Good tacos, cold beer and no inflated pretenses will get my endorsement. By the way, service was poor.

The chips were great but the \"salsa\" was chipolte like flavored red sauce.  It tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.  The table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we ordered it with everything included, it didnt seem to help.  The tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the meat was barely seasoned.  When I ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped  flavor from the rest of the dish.  There should have been a acid to combat the oiliness, a fresh salsa would have worked well. The restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the  children.  This is no fault of the restaurant, however I have to ask, when did it become  acceptable to not take the kids outside when they act up?  Why do some people think it's ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices?",

The entrees (tacos, an enchilada and a chimichanga) were lukewarm. Lindo's prices are roughly 20-percent higher than the other non-strip Mexican eateries around Vegas and this is the overall quality you get?  On a side note, I ordered a Michelada.

Our drink order was taken within a minute or two, and the food and service was all good! They brought our drinks quickly, as well as chips and salsa. I had the chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend had the fish tacos. Both were delivered faster than we anticipated and were delicious. Good portion of food, although it was a little pricy. We paid about $45. There was no mariachi since it was a weekday, but they did have a live singer singing mexican music. The best part was the horchata I ordered - yum!",

A few pieces of the meat were really fatty, and they do the version which is cooked to order and not the version in which the meat simmers in the chile sauce for hours.  To make it worse, they must have had some \"bring your screaming young child\" promotion or something.  For that I blame the parents for not giving enough of a shit about teaching their kids about proper public/restaurant etiquette.",

I wanted shrimp and asked for a recommendation that also had a spicy kick. It was meeeh. About 6 medium shrimp with a cream red sauce that was not as spicy as I had hoped for but remedied that w extra condiment. Certainly wasn't worth the nearly 20 buckaroos. Margaritas were not bad.  Take away got a steak burrito and that was good.   Have to say it's been a chore finding stand out Mexican in this town, and thought it would be the opposite!",

Love coming on the weekends when they have some live music. Its a 1 man band on his piano, but non the less I love it. Little kids tend to get up and dance the night away. It is a good family place where we can come as a family and mommy can drink margaritas and daiquiris.   They have good lunch specials for around $10 found on the back of the menu. They also have great Fideo soup. The shrimp cocktail is good as well.   I tried the oysters one time and no bueno. I guess i should have known better than to order them at a Mexican restaurant. They skip the fixins like the horshradish, etc and just give you plan ol lime.   The steak dishes are great and beef tacos are the bomb diggity. And of course rice and beans with everything!  Make sure to grab a sucker on the way out cause they are the best.",

    "text": "OMG! Best Mexican food we've ever had. Hubby made reservations as it was Valentine's Day and we weren't sure how busy they got. We walked in and were greeted immediately. The host was very friendly and led us to our booth. The place is nicely decorated with flags, wood carvings, and brass decor. A mariachi band played great music in the background and they had us dancing in our seats within minutes. =]  Our server, Oliver was very helpful and attentive. He brought us some chips, salsa, and bean dip. We also ordered Tamarindo juice and Jamaica juice. Both were delicious and not to sweat. We decided to start off with guacamole, which was brought immediately to the table. They prepared it right in front of us using fresh avocado, lime juice, cilantro, onions, and tomatoes. Oliver asked if we needed help with the menu and made his suggestions. Hubby finally decided on Buey al Cilantro and I ordered Toro a la Coca Cola. Both of us ordered our steaks medium rare and crossed our fingers. Surprisingly, for a place that claims to have amazing restaurants, Las Vegas falls short when preparing steaks properly.   While we were waiting, we were served fideo soup, which is thin noodles in a tomato based soup. It was delicious and very savory. When the food came out, both of us were shocked at the huge servings!   The Buey al Cilantro is a rib eye steak cooked with cilantro and spices, covered with verde (green) sauce! The steak was perfectly cooked, we were both thrilled. The steak also came with beans, rice, and your choice of corn or flour tortillas.   The Toro a la Coca Cola is cooked in Coca Cola, garlic, dried red chiles, cloves, and secret ingredient. Yum! This steak was also perfectly cooked. The first bite was absolutely amazing. Their steak is tender, juicy, and wonderfully marinated. Their flour tortillas are huge and we had plenty of food to take home!  The employees are amazing. Even those who were not our servers came by and checked in on us. Our beverages were refilled constantly and was never below the halfway line. If management reads this, please recognize Oliver and Marcos for their wonderful service! Our bill came out to a little less than $60. My husband and I had no problem leaving them a $20 tip. We will definitely come again!",

If you go here for someone's birthday it's quite the extravaganza. Over all I feel that it's one of the best Mexican restaurants in town and would highly recommend it. The only drawback I would say is their pricing is a little high on a couple dishes for what it is but I will pay that for the good service. The location is very convenient and easy to find.   If anyone is looking for good solid Mexican food this is definitely the place on the West side of town. You really can't go wrong by going here.

    "text": "This review depresses me because I really wanted to like this place. Let's start with the service: slow, unfriendly, and terrible. The best service came from the bus boys who circulate and clean our table and refill our drinks. The only friendly people we encountered that night. Chips and salsa: salsa had a nice kick to it but had zero flavor. Same with the bean dip. Nothing special, you can buy a better one in the chip section of your grocery store. I came here for handmade tortillas which are popular in San Diego so I guess my bar was set pretty high anyway. However these were probably the worst tortillas I've had. I would have rather had the ones that I buy from the grocery store. For one they are not fresh which they don't advertise so that's fine but they were super dry and just not good. The queso fundido was okay nothing special but very stingy with the chorizo. My partner got the Carnitas plate which he said was flavorless and dry. I got the beef fajitas which were also flavorless and dry. I literally ate three beef strips and could not stomach the rest. When I bite into the beef the inside is pure white because it is so overcooked, tough and ridiculously dry with a zero flavor. it went to waste because I took it home thinking I could make it better with some salsa and sour cream but it still tasted like rubber so it was a wasted meal. I guess I would understand more if their prices were lowered to accommodate for the non seasoned and over cooked food, however it is pretty pricey for the low quality that you get. I do not recommend this place if you like authentic flavorful Mexican food. And obviously if you're on a budget this is not the place to go. even going through the reviews I did not believe that a place could not have flavor and have so many reviews on how is overcooked and dry their meat is. But my initial thought was well who can mess up beef fajitas it's literally a stir fry. WRONG. I seriously cannot get over how bad it was. :( I wanted to like this place but I will not be returning.",

    "text": "We just ate here and we come here at least a few times a month, me and my family love this spot because SERVICE and food is aways great, but this time was a total miss not because of any issues with the waiter but the food and how the managers attempt to fix anything. I ordered the Campechana and as i was eating it i bit on a small fish hook.. thats right a fish hook! Thank goodness i never swallowed it or it never cut anything in my mouth. I understand with shellfish and some seafood sometimes small objects like shells, bones can get overlooked and missed when kitchen is preparing but this was a major thing that was not properly taken care of by the manager. She was a female, and when coming to apologize she never introduced herself \"name\" and first thing she said was \"so who's the lucky one\".. really?? Thats how you introduce yourself after such an incident. I never like to complain at restaurants or ever make a scene and because i love this place and the service i was very forgiving and just accepted the managers very weak and unprofessional apology, \"keep in mind i just almost swallowed a fish hook\" my wife lost her appetite but i ended up eating and finishing my Novillo al Cognac which is my favorite dish from them. The whole point im getting to is that i'm a restaurant manager myself and i know how complaints are and i would have deal with this guest experience differently. When i received my check everything was on except the Campechana. All the soft drinks kids meals, entrees was still on. Not another apology, table touch or even a nice gesture to take off a few things of the bill. Keep in mind also im not looking for anything for free and i never asked or complained about it but the whole point is it would've been thoughtful for the manager to do because if you think about it and not to exaggerate anything but if i would have swallowed that fish hook it could have been life threatening.",

The chips are complimentary and served with a mild salsa and a warm yummy bean dip. I was recently here for Cinco de Mayo. There were 5 of us and 3 had never been there before. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I like flan and theirs is excellent not too sweet or \"eggy\" tasting. The one thing that stands out for me is their excellent service even during the crowd during Cinco de Mayo the wait staff always made sure we had drinks, chips and water. The music they have on most nights in the bar is a nice touch also.",

How great it was to have someone else do the work, all we had to do was show up and enjoy ourselves. Every single employee was amazing.

We went here yesterday, and let me start with the hostess sitting us all the way in the back, as if she was trying to hide us in an empty restaurant.  Secondly they brought out the chips and salsa with their bean dip.  The beans tasted so gross.  They tasted burnt.  Anyone who knows the difference in cooking beans, or leaving them out overnight will understand this nasty taste.  We ordered the guacamole they prepare at the table, and started to explain to the server.  When we told him about the beans, he stood there and argued with 3 Hispanic women that the beans were fine, not burnt that that's how they are suppose to taste.   GROSS!!!!  We told him no.  No amount of salt would fix this.  He had an attitude that we did not deserve.   We proceeded to order our entrees at this point I was ready to leave sick of his attitude. However Out of town company was here so we tried to make the most of it.  The food came and was lacking flavor the chicken was dry.  The milanesa was tough.  We left, and said this place has gone down hill.  Either they changed cooks or sold the business.  No more Lindo in my families future.  This is sad because I have booked parties in the past, and was never put off by the food like Thursday 4/20/17.",

    "text": "My family and I frequent the Lindo's restaurants a lot. We always alternate from this location to the one on The Loma in Henderson for the fantastic view they have!   We always get exceptional, superb service at both locations.  The staff always go above and beyond. They're very social. I haven't had a bad experience yet. The food is always good, the alcohol, even better. Their strawberry margaritas are mighty tasty.  I try to get a different dish each time I go, but top three are the chicken fajitas (come out sizzling hot), enchiladas suizas (made with cream cheese, you can't go wrong with cream cheese!), and their shrimp salad (tossed with lemon and avocados). You can't go wrong with those dishes. Tortillas are always fresh and handmade and come with some dishes, not all.   Meanwhile you wait for your food, you can either order an appetizer or just stuff your face with the chips/beans/salsa that they put out for you. If you're going to go with an appetizer, the queso fundido is a must, lot's of cheesy goodness! You can opt to get it with green chile strips or chorizo, both are equally delicious.   Nothing but good vibes and good food every time we come.",

I gave one star for the customer service and two stars for the live music which I didn't understand because it was in Spanish which I like as well. Also I loved the atmosphere of the place. Now why didn't I give this place 4 or 5 stars. Well at a restaurant you have to base some on the food. Everything was bland. I ordered a chimichanga shred beef inside the shell wasn't crunchy and lol I said it didn't really taste like much even though it has red Sauce all over it. Had a good time but the food wasn't great. Thanks for the customer service :)",

If you go to Lindo, you MUST get the table-side guacamole. They bring all of the ingredients to your table, ask you how you like it, and then they make it right there. So good! I'm boring and I always get the steak fajitas, but they are bomb. Can't really go wrong with food here.   Margaritas are delicious, too ;)  Service is normally good, though sometimes it can be a little iffy.",

Very bland. The shrimp dish was over $20 and wasn't that great for the price. Also the shrimps were tiny. I thought this place was going to be good since it had so many great reviews but it wasn't. It's way too over priced. The quality, flavor, and price made me give this place a 2 out of 5 stars.",

I One would MAYBE feel that they were being rushed to eat and go because I did notice they immediately kept taking the dishes away after we finished eating, rushed with bringing the check, etc .. But, thats how I like it .. I like getting my food/check/water/service .. everything prompt so thats why I didnt mind, (coming from an impatient person) while others maybe don't like getting rushed .. But overall, the food was great!! They start you off with unlimited nachos with hot/medium sauces. For drinks, we ordered the frozen Mango and Raspberry Margaritas .. which were good. We shared the Carne Asada knowing that their plates are HUGE and we still were full. For desert we ordered the Flan, which was the only one that was \"eh\" .. I had better! But overall, the place is pretty big, they have a live entertainment with some nice Spanish music and the whole atmosphere and decor was very nice. I'll definetly hit this spot up again if I am craving Mexican.",

Hell visit the table next to us but won't check if we need anything. For what you get, it's pretty pricey. They give you chips and salsa-which is really spicy. I ordered the chicken flautas with flour instead or corn. They charge extra for flour. This alone was $15.95. My sister ordered the beef chimichanga for $9.95. Beef was unfortunately dry.

The \"cry today cry tomorrow\" dish was REALLY GOOD, the meat was DELICIOUS where it was cooked medium rare, but majority of it was way too rare for me so I got a few bites. I recommend maybe ordering it medium so that they can accomplish the medium rare steak. The sauce wasn't spicy at all and had great flavors! I'll come back and get this next time!

My daughter and I ordered the Tamales Al la cart and we could barely choke down a bite. My daughter was like Mommy why do these taste funny, so I took a bite and I can tell you they tasted like they had frost bite from the freezer and then were covered up by a can of Hunts Tomato Sauce. The cornmeal was a weird texture and all around just horrible. I just couldn't eat it and still have flash back about the taste. For the prices they need to cook authentic Mexican food. I don't know maybe there is a magical dish there that everyone loves but we sure didn't find it. the other person at my table ordered Carne Asada well done that came out rare at best, sent that back and it still was not great. All in all if I was ever forced to go back I would just order a drink and call it a day. There are way to many Mexican Restaurants in this town with yummy food to waste your time on this place.",

I had a margarita-frozen which was just okay. We had this appetizer that I crave. I forget the name. Basically it looks like a shrimp burrito. It's fantastic. My daughter got a child's plate with a quesadilla and rice and beans. I got a combo plate with cheese enchilada, tostada and taco (I hate shredded beef) and rice and beans. My son got a #13 Combo with a burrito and enchilada which he promptly doused then bathed in ghost peppers and habanero sauces to the the shock and awe of the staff. They inquired as to his need of water or milk which he declined. Ghost peppers aren't hot enough for him. At this point, I think he would delight in chemical burns. He has a vast array of hot sauces at home.   Our food was tasty and satisfying. I asked for cherry cheesecake for desert and they told me they were out. Then they found some squirreled away and made my day. The next thing I know, they bring out a sombrero, churro desert and a shot of tequila along with 3 free hot pink Mother's Day T-Shirts! They sing Happy Birthday Panchita and my son got the entire humiliating scenario on camera. The tequila was very smooth, I gotta get me somma that! It's Giro. Smoother even than Patron!   It was a nice birthday/Mother's Day that my kids and I will always cherish. We will be back again and again.",

If you can't do simple things like that then who know what tips will be.   I ordered the Fillet Relleno I had to try it but it wasn't to my liking. I mean for $20 you thinking it would be amazing. The spouse ordered the carne asada. Not bad but it just didn't have that taste. The taste of carne asada which you can taste it's True. I've had my share of carne asada but this is OK. Maybe next time we will pick something different. The kids well she ordered her usual bean and rice side. No matter if it is amazing or blah, she will still love it.",

The tacos had very little of the cabbage slaw that the menu listed, and included one giant wilted slab of cabbage. The serving of rice and beans was stingy.

Stopped here at the insistence of a friend before we hit the strip to club and build our regrets. I was pleasantly pleased with the vegetarian options. I chose the Veggie Fajita plate and it was a huge portion of perfectly seasoned veggies (and not just like, broccoli in some salsa, actual squash, mushrooms, onions, etc that made a pretty decent dish). Beans were ok. Rice was bomb. Tortillas were obviously homemade. I wanted more, but did I need more? Absolutely not.   Price was pretty fair, I think I paid about $15? Not including tip.

The waiter dressed as Robin hood I think and the waitress was in camouflage like a commando.  It took a while for him to come to the table. He obviously didnt want to be there. I was thinking he might be either hungover or just not feeling like he wanted to be there today.. he asked the normal, drinks first. Never mocked at us was looking to the sides and to the floor. Took our drink orders and left. Waitress came with chips and beans and salsa for the table. I asked, \"Do you have hotter salsa\"? She said that is the hot salsa and pointed at the red sauce. I said so u dont have a hotter one? A habanero salsa? She just stared at me, then said yes we do...and kept staring... I said, well can I have some or no? She didnt say anything just stared for a sec longer and turned and left while she let a big breathe out because I was apparently putting her out or I was being a pain, anyway she also was obviously not wanting to be there.... Waiter came back and took our order.  Again rubbing his temples like we were a bother. Very uncomfortable for me and my mom... we got our food and drinks and started eating. I wondered if I was gonna get hotter salsa. I heard her yell in the kitchen for the habanero salsa. She came out from the kitchen walked around the restaurant with the salsa, like she couldn't remember who ordered it. There was only one other table with customers. She came over and sat it on my table and pointed at it. I didn't say anything, then she said \"That's the habanero hot sauce\" then just walked away. The whole time she  just seemed upset.  My mom and I just ate and talked and was almost finished when she came back and asked if I wanted more ice tea. It's the classic I'll be nice now that the tip is coming soon. Even the waiter now comes over with a smile and asked, \"cant I get you more tea?\"  I said no thanks. I was already set on no tip...I NCR complain about food or complain about anything while I'm there. I know what ppl do to customers that complain...she asked again nicely but too late if I wanted more tea. I said again \"no thanks\".  I never do this but I didn't leave a tip at all. I was upset at the rudeness and misery of the two workers.  The good food isn't enough to make us go back. I tossed the remainder of the giftcard I used. I just dont want it...will not go back...  It's too bad that the management did t pick better servers/waiters for their staff. That's a real deal breaker..",

They start you off with on the house chips, salsa, beans and once you order you get a small bowl of their special Fideo soup which is delicious. Didn't even have to order an appetizer. Food portions are generous and each main dish will cost you around $15-$20. I had the steak/chicken fajitas which came out sizzling and served with rice, gauc, and beans on the side. Big plus is that they have Hand made tortillas made right at the restaurant. My wife had the carne asada plate which was really really good and huge portion. Good energy, they come out and sing and make a lot of noise for birthdays. Being Mexican myself, I definitely recommend this place for a good authentic dinner.",

    "text": "After we were seated they brought out a complimentary cup of soup for my son, which he proceeded to grab and dump in my lap. Luckily it was only luke warm and didn't do much damage other than irritate me and soak my shorts. Despite that unfortunate beginning, we had a good time at Lindo.  I've only been to Mexico a few times and can't speak to the authenticity of the place. But, judging from it's location in Spring Valley (btw, thanks Misti for finally establishing the neighborhoods for Vegas Yelp, otherwise I would have thought this place was in Summerlin ; ) and the surrounding neighborhoods I'm guessing they cater to a gringo audience. Since I'm a gringo myself I don't mind.  The service was excellent. Our order was taken promptly, food came out quickly, water was refilled frequently, dishes were picked up right after we were done, and the waiter(s) stopped by often to check in on us.  The food was pretty good overall. I liked the chips, salsa and bean dip. The guacamole is made tableside to your desired level of spiciness and it was some of the best guac I've had in a long time. The amount was more than enough for the three of us and would have been good for four adults. We got an order of flautas (3 beef and 3 chicken). The beef was a little dry and not too flavorful. The chicken was tender and tasty -- definitely the better of the two. We  also got a beef tamale. It was oversauced and too mushy for my liking. My son had the cheese quesadilla, which he liked.  The atmosphere is great for families -- and there were a LOT of families there. One side of the restaurant had a mariachi band and the other side (near the bar) had a guy on keyboards singing. There was even a little \"dance\" area where kids were getting their groove on. This is definitely one of the better family-friendly restaurants in the area.",

I attended a family dinner here earlier in the evening and it was only a 5 minute wait to seat all 15 of us (we were assholes and didn't even make a reservation beforehand so bonus points for them being able to accommodate all of us so gracefully). At no point did I have to ask to have my drink refilled (and I go through a glass of coke in like 5 minutes flat you should see it in person) and the waiters were extremely attentive. The food is amazing; I usually get the chicken enchiladas and the fideo soup. The interior of the restaurant itself is super cute--lots of Latin American inspired decor and they frequently have a live performer who sings and plays on a keyboard. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it yet. If you decide to go, play a little prank on the person joining you and tell the wait staff that it's their birthday. Trust me, you won't regret it.",

We ordered the Marinated Chicken Castillo,  Flautas and a Shredded Beef Burrito. Man it came out quick cause we barely got through one bowl of chips. I like the fact all the meals came with guacamole which saves you a ton of dinero, cause what's Mexican food without some guacamole. Drinks were always full to help put out the fire  cause I like it spicy. I really should eat here more cause the shits da bomb.

We received our food and as I took the first bite, I had something in my teeth that felt odd or weird, as my wife looked at me and said maybe it's cheese, I then began pulling it out of my mouth and it was a long black hair which did not belong to me, because I shave my head and my wife's hair is brown and it was physically impossible to have her hair fall into my food cause she was sitting across from me when the waiter placed our food down.   Once I noticed this, I immediately asked for the manager and both the waiter and manager were shocked and the manager actually had the nerve to ask me if the hair possibly belonged to me and or my wife, I laughed and had to ask are you kidding me my head is shaved and my wife's hair is brown not black, he then said we can remake your food and comp this meal.   I said no to the manager and appreciated his comp, but I had lost my hunger after having that in my meal. I took one bite and had a long black hair in my food. Now other than this it was an alright place, but since then I won't and refuse to return, because not only did I walk out without a comp which I honestly didn't have to have, but the respect of the manager should have been there and he should of said your next meal for myself and my wife should of been comped.   Normally in a situation like this I never complain I don't care about spending the money it was the fact I was asked is the hair mine lol or my wife's when food was just brought out.",

Always refilling water, chips and salsa without needing to ask.  we always sit in the room to the right because my kids do not like the music in the other room.  We were two adults and  3 kids. My wife and I ordered the Gallo mojo de ajo which is chicken with garlic gravy. The gravy has chunks of garlic which I love.  the chicken here is pounded thin which I like as well. The flour tortillas are thin and excellent and are served with the dish.  One of our kids split with us and two ordered of the kids menu.   we also ordered the table side Guacamole. They come to the table and make it right there. They ask how spicy you want it. it was good.   If you order order a meal they bring a red soup with noodles is very tasty.   The food came very quickly which was nice because we had our kids with us.  overall. it is a good solid restaurant.",

I tried the chicken but despite it's compelling description, it just tasted like chicken in tomato sauce. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet not particulary moist either.  The seats were comfy, there was live entertainment, so the atmosphere was nice and comfy. My overall experience was nice, I think it's partially due to the servers being super attentive and accommodating. :)",

The food always taste fresh, hot and lots of flavor. Have had the carne asada dish, tacos, fajitas. All taste excellent. Drinks are good as well. Good selection from bottled beers to drafts.  I don't really have anything negative to say about this restaurant. Every time i have come here it has been excellent.   Staff and service is on point, and friendly.

As other reviewers have said, the soup is delicious! It was probably my favorite part of the meal. The portions are pretty large, the chips/salsa was good and fresh.  Now the negatives - the flavor of the food is just okay. Compared to Cantina Laredo or the now closed Agave, it's a 5 out of 10. The chicken in my enchilada was a little dry. There was too much cheese in the chile relleno. I like cheese, but it overpowered the dish. The beef taco was a bit bland.  All in all, I was satisfied after dinner, but it didn't leave me counting the days until I go back.",

We ordered a side of guacamole, the waiter seemed to hesitate but finally delivered it after being reminded again. When it arrived, it was poorly prepared (lumpy and tasteless).

Sometimes it takes 15 or more minute before you see your server. They serve a lot of authentic Mexican dishes so don't come here for tacos or a burrito. Try something new and enjoy the satisfaction of an experiment that panned out in your favor. My favorite is called Chicken Stephania.  The margaritas chips and salsa are all great.",

It has the same fresh, awesome taste as the other locations.  Good start.  After browsing the menu for a little while, I settled on the Lunch Special #3 \"Tres\".....Beef Chimichanga.  I was going to order a Dos XX or a Pacifico, but since my friends were on lunch from work, I didn't want to throw it in their face that I can drink at lunch and they can't....so I abstained and had an Iced Tea.  The food came out pretty fast.  The Chimichanga comes with Rice, Beans, and Sour Cream & Guacamole on the side.  It was cooked just right.....the fried Tortilla was crispy, flaky, and not greasy.  The Beef was shredded and full of flavor.  I like to get their signature Salsa and pour it on top of the Chimichanga....because the Salsa packs a lot of heat and has that Smoky Chipotle flavor to it.  I mixed the Beans & Rice together and devoured the plate.  The service was excellent and everyone had a good time.  We spent an hour after lunch talking and catching up on stuff.....even though we settled our bill, the server ensured our glasses were full and that everyone was ok.  It's the signature service I've come to know and love about Lindo and his restaurants....glad to see it was the same here.  Will I return?  Of course!",

Have been there at least 10 times and what brings me back is the nuance of spices in every dish. My favorite is the Gallo el Chipolte Estilo, a smoky, spicy, moist and tender chicken entree. Another in our party got the Gallo al conaq (lemon and garlic), something I would have never <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fordered.as&s=013446da92312d66bd1b67ca3715597f28247189512d2482bfc3fb08607290a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ordered.as</a> it sounded too simple.. but one bite changed that! Love the Fideo soup they serve with every meal. Typical Mexican decor, cheerful and comfortable and a staff that aims to please. Good bang for the buck... $25 per person can get a great meal and mojito!",

So we drove across the street and checked out Lindo Michoacan.    -Authentic Mexican food in a convenient area. -Chips, salsa and sopa de fideo were great starters -Camarones al mojo de ajo - excellent garlicky, buttery, lemony sauce and the shrimp were not overcooked (which many restaurants tend to do for some reason) -Buey al Cilantro - steak was cooked medium and again this spicy green sauce was excellent -Tasty margaritas - yes they push their margaritas with their house tequila, but they are worth it!  I cannot understand the 3/2/1 star reviews for this restaurant - it is a solid 4 as far as I'm concerned.  Have my standards for Mexican food dropped after living on the East Coast where there is no good Mexican food?  Possibly.  But Lindo Michoacan West is worth another visit when we are in town again.",

Everything we ordered was very bland and not seasoned AT ALL. I had the steak chimichanga, and had to salt the whole thing, including the refried beans, which had zero flavor. We had the queso fundido with chorizo as an appetizer, and it was hands down the best dish of the night, but very small in portion. The place is very overpriced for the food that you get. Both of us agreed at the end of the meal that we would've been better off at Roberto's or even Chipotle.",

The servers are always very friendly and attentive and the food has never disappointed.  And the margaritas...yummm! Don't forget to try to pina colada.    I want to tell you my favorite dish here, however I can't choose just one.  The tableside guacamole is amazing, and cool to watch them make it fresh.  The shrimp ceviche is great.  Fajitas, fish tacos, flautas, carne asada, burritos...yep its all good.  And what I really dig is that they don't throw black olives, iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and sour cream on top of everything like many other \"Mexican\" restaurants.  Another cool thing is the live music.  I think its on weekend nights there is a guy singing traditional spanish songs.  Love Love Love Lindo Michoacan.",

I believe they also have outdoor seating as well. They serve complimentary chips and salsa, along with refried beans. Chips were delicious. Thick and cruncy. I hate the flimsy ones some places give you. The salsa was OK, it was smoky maybe or something, but I like mine with more of a tomato kick. The beans were good but they got cold quickly. I ordered the veggie fajitas. It's my favorite mexican dish. It was pretty good. Not the best I've had but good. My friend got the chicken enchiladas and she enjoyed. They had a chipotle cesar salad and I was torn between that and the fajitas. I wish I would have gotten that. It has grilled corn and queso fresco with chipotle cesar dressing....sounds delicious. Maybe I'll try that next time! Price was definitely pricey. Not cheap at all. Portion sizes were nice though. Service was good and food was good.",

We were seated immediately and within 30 seconds our waiter came to the table to take our order.   We told him that we were just seated and needed time to look at the menu.  We did order club sodas and the bus boy brought those over with chips and salsa within 2 minutes.  The waiter came back a few minutes later to take our order.  Our first course was a tomato based soup which was very good.  About 10 minutes after we ordered our meal it showed up to the table.  I was beginning to feel a little rushed.  A moment later the bus boy showed up at our table and tried to clear away our chips and salsa that we were still eating.  I let him know this and he left them and went away.   My husband ordered chicken fajitas and it only came with 3 very small tortillas.  We got the attention of our waiter as requested a few additional.  By the time he brought them back to the table 15 minutes later my husband had just continued to eat his dinner with a fork and no longer required them as we had finished eating.  We then requested to go containers.  The waiter brought them to the table.  As my husband and I were packing up our leftovers the bus boy again came by and tried to clear my dishes before I could pack up my food.  My plate was over half-full when he tried to take it.  I again say while the food was very good the wait staff needs additional training.  I do not think we will be visiting this location again.",

I am a vegetarian and I always order the veggie fajitas. Last night, I found a piece of steak in my fajitas. And the worst part about that is I found a piece of chicken in my veggie fajitas the prior visit. This happening to me twice in my last two visits only tells me one thing. They are extremely careless in the kitchen and don't give a crap about cross contamination. I can only imagine what would happen and how horrific it would be if someone goes in with a food allergy. If these people really don't care like this, I'm also pretty sure nothing is sanitary. Good luck eating in a dirty place like this where the employees (and owners) have no care about what their customers are eating. I won't ever make the same mistake again!!",

Upon entering, the hostess were NOT welcoming at all. My wife had asked the hostess if we can sit at the bar, and the hostess asked at the bar or at a table... and my wife said just in the general area, and the hostess replied with we only have a table. And then she said we can seat you at a table we don't have booths. My wife replied, okay that's fine, and the hostess seats us at a wobbly table across from an available booth.   I immediately noticed the table was wobbly so once our server came I had asked to move to a different table.   The server was nice upon arrival. Got our drinks quickly. However, at first the impression wasn't that friendly nor welcoming. As the night went on, he warmed up to us and became more personable.   The food was mediocre. I was actually disappointed. I didn't finish. The food was bland. Only thing I enjoyed was the Fideo Soup and chips/ salsa. Our shots were yummy and the drinks were good.   Would I be so eager to return? No. It was a disappointment altogether. Reason why I took off 2 stars. Probably being generous with the rating.",

We went during dinner time on a weekend and there were lots of seats and tables available, so that's not a good sign, but hey never judge a book by its cover. We were seated very fast  and were given tortilla chips, salsa, and refried beans. My sister ordered the Carnitas while I ordered the Stephanie. Both our foods came out dry and even though the Stephanie is covered in sauce on the chicken, it was still really dry. The chips and dips did not taste like they were fresh or hand made. Our chips tasted like it came from a grocery store, same thing with the salsa. Service wasn't that great considering our server never asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks or if everything was good or if we wanted more chips and salsa. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I had a friend that REALLY wanted to go here. Solid 3 star.",

    "text": "Having moved to Vegas last August, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to miss anything about LA. Well, turns out, I do miss several things about LA, but, number 1, hands down, is the Mexican food.  My wife and I came here several nights ago, and seriously, I'm still sad that THIS is considered the best Mexican food Vegas has to offer. We ordered several entree's, cause that's how we roll when we try new places, plus, we have food for a day or two more at home!  We ordered a combo plate that included a pork burrito, beef enchilada and a chicken taco. The carnitas plate. Street taco plate, and bacon wrapped shrimp.  The issue I have with ALL their food hands down, is that it was all just bland. From the beginning of the meal, the bean dip, blah. The salsa, blah. Then onto the entree's, just all flat. To the point where I started to get really sad. I love Mexican food, it's like my number 2 favorite cuisine, and I was sad because, THIS place is considered to be greatness.   The chef/owner has the audacity to plaster his face all over the menu, which is all fine, but you better come correct with your flavors. You're not on Iron Chef, you're not chef Gordon Ramsay. If your picture is on every other page, I expect your food to be mind blowing.   The best thing we had, was the carnitas, and again, not because of flavor, but because of how well it was cooked, temperature wise. It wasn't over or undercooked, as most places that serve carnitas fall under. It had nicely caramelized edges, but still moist. I just wish they had a pantry in the kitchen with herbs and spices.  This is all I'm saying to the owners/managers of this restaurant, please take a day trip to Los Angeles and head to a restaurant called Salsa and Beer, they have two locations. They have the BEST Mexican food, north of the border, and also, check out their pricing. Salsa and Beer is what I expected this place to be, but it wasn't even close.  If this is what Vegas has to offer as far as Mexican, I'm screwed. Also, it means there's a HUGE opening for someone to open a kick-ass Mexican restaurant, cause this ain't cutting it.  PS - My wife just brought something to my attention. With ALL the food we ordered, we didn't take a single thing home with us. As I mentioned earlier, we usually order multiple plates when going somewhere new, so that we can basically \"sample\" the restaurant. That being said, without even thinking about it, when our server came around and asked if we wanted to take anything, I instantly said no. If you know me, you know that's extremely unusual. I'll often even take things I wasn't impressed with home with me, in hopes of \"fixing\" them.   Two stars for atmosphere, and their margaritas are good, I'd come back and just drink at the bar.  Food: 1 Ambience: 4 Service: 3 Value: 1",

    "text": "I am Mexican , and i love Mexican food !  I do like Lindo Michoacan ! However there are just too many places near by that are easier choices !  The location and parking of this place is perfect.   There a couple things that keep me from coming here more often   1. The number one reason  I tend to choose other places is .....the pricing of Lindo. They are a little too pricey for me.   2. They have a large menu but it's almost too large and not only is it too large, they limit your options and almost force you to spend $12 or more no matter what. For example they have 1 side soup option which is Fideo soup . Everything else is offered as a main entree.... for example they have seafood soup entree, beef soup chicken soup etc . They don't offer cups just large bowls and the bowl of chicken soup we ordered was too large and far too expensive for the rubbery over cooked chicken that came in the chicken soup. A cup for $6 would have worked!   3. Their chips and salsa were mediocre and the bean dip was and is never very tasty.   4. The good thing about Lindo is they are not terrible as a matter of fact i enjoy going for brunch . They do have machines if you like to play and TVs at the bar , a good selection of seafood , good food and they do have good service !",

Food was not good and the service was HORRENDOUS!! But I figured maybe it was just that one time and I decided to give it another shot.... this last time was even worse! Food was nothing special, But Jesus the service was bad! We waited 10 min just to have our drink order taken, and over 20 minutes to have our food order taken.... the place was not that busy so idk what the hold up was... and obviously the waiter was aware because he kept apologizing about the service or lack of! And as the night went on the service got worse and worse! It was hard to enjoy the food because our glasses stayed empty for the majority of our dinner. Seriously get it together and train your staff properly! This was the final straw and I will not be returning! Juan's flaming fajitas is where it's at!!!",

Start with fresh chip with salsa and warm refried beans, that's great. Order shrimp Diablo and chicken pepian ... the flavor for the shrimp diablo was flavorful and just right amount of heat. And also come with fresh made tortilla ( that's best part) for chicken pepian lacks of flavor and chicken too dry. Service was quick and attentive.",

The queso fundido was horrible; a big glob of melted cheese with some chiles thrown in. We had to CUT the dip and plop it on tortillas to eat it. Not a good start. My shrimp dish was mundane at best and my rice was filled with Lima beans. Our waiter was inattentive, acting as though we were an inconvenience. The only person that was awesome was our busboy, who was not only helpful answering questions, but also made sure that we were taken care of at every turn. I am BAFFLED by the fact that this restaurant is consistently named Best of Las Vegas every year. I can overlook a mediocre meal but bad service I cannot. I will not be back and will not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "My wife, son and I used to love coming here but today was horrible. I came here with my son and two of my friends. The waiter was rude, I asked for a small sauce of Habanero to go with my Chips and he rudely just said \"Someone will bring it out\". Asked on 2 other separate occasions still nothing just ignored. It was the Busser/Buss Boy who I asked that brought it over. Waiter was only seen 3 times. One to ask what we wanted to drink when we came in and to take drink order, second when dropping off the drinks and taking food order and last walking by quickly and asking if I wanted another Margarita. The Busser/Buss Boy practically served/waited on us.   Personally the food here is a hit or miss as my son did not like his Chicken, my food was ok nothing spectacular today but I have had better on different days, so I will not knock the food it is good.   But Customers or Patrons do NOT need to deal with rude Waiters or people going through shit in their lives, you are paid to wait on customers and as a reward you get a good tip for your service. Today the service was worth nothing but a waste of our time. Someone should promote the Busser/Buss Boy and Girls at this place and fire the Waiters because this is not a unique experience at this place but the norm it seems.  We all need to support local businesses that actually care for their customers in Las Vegas and my family does its best. Businesses need to do their best to put a smile on their customers faces and not leave them disgusted with service or lack thereof. I even had to call over the same Busser/Buss Boy to run my card as we were done and the rude Waiter was no where to be found still.  So take it from a long time customer, and I have to say I have had great experiences with many of the Bussers/Buss Girls and Guys there, always pleasant etc. Take my word for it, if your waiter would rather be somewhere else and does not get you what you asked for of disappears and is rude take your business elsewhere.",

The salsa has some kick to it. It's not my favorite type of salsa but it still good.   To drink I got the horchata. I love me some of that. It was a little bit watery for my liking but still refreshing. They were quick to refill my glass though which is always good.    I like to get their table side guacamole. It's fresh and delicious. If you like salt you will need to add some but I'm glad they don't over salt it.  This time I got the Chicken Flautas on flour tortillas. They give you 6 which is more than enough. They also come with a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were alright. I have had better.    The service is usually excellent at both places. I give it a 4 because of the salsa.

I ordered steak fajitas, it was a bit pricey for food I haven't had but I took a chance,  $18.95, my husband ordered fish tacos.  I was so disappointed! The meat was tender but had absolutely no flavor, I tried the beans and rice, guacamole all the same Flavorless! Who has ever had refried beans they didn't like...  I have thrown away so much money in Vegas trying to find good Mexican food like back in the Oakland Bay Area. It's frustrating...I give up. Anybody heard of Mexicali Rose in Oakland? That's the kind of flavor I'm looking for.  The presentation was good, the steak was sizzling, I thought it was more onions and peppers than anything.  They brought 2 small flour tortillas, there was no cheese and I had to ask for pico de galo, again this flavorless meal was $18.95.  I would advise anyone wanting Mexican food to try Javier's inside the Aria.  It's not old school authentic, but it is good if you don't mind paying a bit more.",

The outside is big, beautiful and traditional looking. The Servers and Hostesses where dressed in traditional clothing. ( Love it!) The Inside is decorated like a Fiesta. Love the atmosphere- everyone that took care of us was great, attentive and had great conversation with us. And as if that wasn't enough the food and drinks were Great! The portion sizes and flavor was perfect. Couldn't have been happier with our experience here. So worth the drive off the strip..",

My absolutely favorite dish here is the carnitas a la coca cola. The meat is really tender and super flavorful. I also like their flautas. And their complimentary fideo soup is so delicious! Almost every time we come here, we're seated right away. Except for one time when we went on a Sat around 7:30 pm, it was super packed and we had to wait about 40 min to get a table. So you should make a reservation if you're going there on a Sat. It gets pretty loud when they're busy (I hate loud restaurants). The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes they get super busy & because their complimentary corn chips & salsa could be better. The chips are a little on the thick side, not light and crispy. And their salsa seems more like hot sauce than salsa (not tomato-y enough). But their flour chip that comes as a garnish in your entree is delicious. The food portions are a good amount for the price. And I like how they have lollipops instead of boring mints. I keep coming back here again and again.",

The Lindo Michoacan near the strip set the standard that I assumed all Lindo Michoacans follow.  However, this location did not meet my expectation.  We sat down and had our drink orders taken.  After the waiter brought us our drinks, we didn't see him for 15 minutes.  In that time we had finished our drinks and couldn't get a refill on the drinks or the chips and salsa.  I assume he was busy elsewhere because the wait staff appeared to be understaffed, as a man in a button up shirt and khaki trousers who appeared to be the manager was bringing dishes out to people's tables.  The man in the button up eventually motioned our waiter to our table and our waiter took our order.  The food came a little while later.  The food was fantastic, as it is at both locations I have been to.",

    "text": "BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! I cannot vouche for this restaurant enough! First time I went here I had flown out to Las Vegas, from California, with my dad several years ago when we were looking at UNLV as a possible college for me to attend. On our last night in town our family friends who lived in Summerlin recommended we go to this restaurant as a send-off for me and my dad. What an awesome dinner we had and not to mention, consumed my first shot of tequila here! It also happened to be my 18th birthday and upon my father and friends telling the waiters this information, they swiftly retrieved a gigantic sombrero, snuck up behind me and plopped that hat right down over my head and then proceeded to throw a shot of tequila straight down my throat! Everyone at the table was shocked (Whether it was because I was only 18 and took it like a champ or that the waiters had no idea I was only 18)! We laughed for days after this and still do til this day. Such a fun night, amazing food, killer guacamole, and super attentive servers and waiters (; This may have been the deciding factor in me choosing UNLV later on. Who knows! Loved the restaurant. Still do. Visit every time I'm in town and recommend it to anyone looking for a little Mexican fix. Every location in Las Vegas is great and they are always consistent with their food! Thanks for the memories Lindo!!!! Can't wait to be back in your delicious presence again! How I fiend for you all the way from the Bay Area!",

I ordered cheese enchiladas and was served beef enchiladas so I had to send it back.  The cheese enchilada they brought back to me had so much cheese you could not find the tortilla.   The food was not good and flavor was boring.   I was extremely disappointed especially since this restaurant had received best of Las Vegas 2012.   My guest felt the same way about his dinner.   If you want a nice bar and  want to listen to good music, then I recommend this place.  If you want good Mexican Food, I recommend going somewhere else.",

It was possible some of the least authentic I've had and I am able to compare after eating some of the best Mexican food at La Roca (in Mexico/on the border of Tucson and Nogales) and other places in California.  I prefer hole-in-the-walls over high-priced faux.  Ordered the enchilada and taco but before the entree, I thought the tri-colored chips (red and blue) tasted heavily of food coloring and the salsa was terrible.  But I am also biased because I like salsa fresca styles over the thick \"tomato sauce\" type that remind me of jar salsa.  When you order a taco, a True Mexican taco is not deep fried...but mine was.  This wasn't an issue, I only point it out that it's not \"real\" Mexican food and I would debate on how many people have truly had authentic Mexican food to compare.  The good part was the guacamole was fresh and tasted wonderful and I thought the wait staff was nice.   I won't go back again....overpriced and the food wasn't great.",

It was the most flavorful & tender steak I've ever had at a mexican diner. The tacos are crispy with shredded beef. By some stroke of magic the taco topping are still cool instead of all hot & wilted like other places. The service here is better than most any place you will ever visit. They take pride in their work and they want to make sure everything is to your liking. The menu is very extensive and reasonably priced and the servers are very good at describing all the dishes for you. If this place was in my neighborhood, I'd work a deal to wash the dishes for a free meal every day. Hats off!!",

This should not stop anyone from going here. Every other employee here is super nice and friendly. That's the only reason Grumpy is so noticeable. Who knows?  Maybe she just doesn't like the look of my face! Plus, you have to try the food here. The soups are amazing. Not just the small cup of fideo soup they bring before the entree,  the dinner soups are the best. In fact, our family has never had a bad meal. Every time we go,  whatever we order is fantastic. The dining area and Restrooms are always clean. They even have live music. For an even better experience, try the table side guacamole or the flaming ice cream dessert. That's right, \"flaming!\"  To sum up: One grumpy apple does not spoil the bunch. This outstanding restaurant gets Five well deserved stars!",

I was with someone else who always gets the chilaquiles there and they said it was great like any other time.  Maybe they have hired new chefs now, I don't know.

    "text": "Went here last Sunday morning, I've been to the other michoacan on sunset and always liked it. Didn't realize there was a location so close to me until seeing it on yelp. My gf had a craving for chilaquiles so we decided to give try this location out.          We went her brother, his gf, and their uncle. The girls got the chilaquiles, the brother and I had the menudo, uncle had some shrimp dish. We also had a couple bloody Mary's and some horchata. The menudo was good, it had a nice clean flavor and wasn't gamey at all. Chilaquiles were ok and shrimp was just ok too. Everything seemed to be a little bland and we need to use a lot of condiments to add some spice. The bloody Mary's had great flavor but I would prefer them a bit stronger since they were $10 each.        Overall it was ok but I enjoyed the other location we tried a little more. The service was decent except it took them like 15 mins to run our cards after we got the bill. Value is not that great, our bill was a little over $100 for some basic Mexican fare. Probably won't be back anytime soon, would rather drive a bit for better cheaper Mexican.",

Margarita's are good, but I wish they had a better happy hour.  On Sunday, they do a buffet, which is good, but not spectacular. I would just order a plate from the menu, but the buffet does give a good variety.",

The food was a pleasant surprise, and although dinner was a bit pricy, the portions were large enough for us to have next-day leftovers. My cochinita revolcada (carnitas sauteed in multiple salsas) was delicious, and the pork was cooked perfectly - juicy and tender enough to cut with a fork. I'm not a fan of refried beans, but the beans served with the tortilla chips and salsa was good enough for us to ask for a second bowl. The good food coupled with the excellent service will definitely bring us back again.",

Thinking back to the times I had ordered margaritas in the past, I figured they were good. Wrong!  I'm wondering if they use a cheap tequila in the two for one drinks, because it was awful!  When I want mexican food, I also want a good margarita. I think they need to use better tequila.

Before I needed to drive to the other side of town and while it was well worth it, a shorter drive is always better, if the experience is the same...  And I'm happy to say they have done a great job of bringing a similar experience to the west side of town. They staff is friendly, food consistently excellent and the ambiance feels authentic  (i.e. not like a Denny's with a splash of Mexican paint/art work!). I've already eaten there twice and the Carney dishes are still highly recommended.  The salsa seems a bit different in consistency (very blended) but the taste is the same. I recently tried the fajitas and did not love them. But the fish taco was great (soft, not hard shell!, you'll thank me).  All in all highly recommended, they do not get the five for a few reasons:  1) It was tough for me to find the address of this location. Internet Marketing please!  2) While the newer location is nice, it just doesn't have the feel of the Desert Inn location.  3) I have never been to Lindo and not heard at least one person be wished happy birthday by the staff. I haven't heard this at the new location.  I think Lindo Michoacan has an excellent management team. Never met them, just judging on how the business is run and the feel from the staff. Cheers!",

A small description of the Mexican named dishes would be a nice touch for those not in the know.   The salsa is a nice, but unique change from the usual pureed tomatoes served on the east coast, and with refried beans to boot. The chips are different also, with thicker chips help to mound up salsas, beans, and the queso fundito.  The fish tacos are decent, but nothing to write home about being overly dry, but not totally without flavor. I am used to an aioli or some sort of jalapeno mayo to help moisten the fish, so I just used the salsa instead. Maybe it's just how this place does tacos pescado???   All-in-all I think I would give this place another chance with another set of dishes, so there might be another update in the near future.",

They start with fresh chips, a bean dip and a decent red sauce. At the suggestion of the waiter, I ordered the taco, tostada and enchilada combo. I'm not sure how, but the meals were delivered in less than 5 minutes. I wondered if they were pre-made. The plate looked good and the portions were decent and the amount of chicken was very good. The downside is that there was very little spice or heat in the meal. I ended up putting almost 3 bowls of the red sauce on everything to get the flavor up. The best thing was the spanish rice, everything else was a little bland.",

I ordered the carnitas plate which was supposed to be one of the \"house specialties\" there and it was SO DISAPPOINTING.  The oil tasted old and the meat had a terrible flavor to it. I managed to eat the beans and a couple of spoon fulls of Spanish rice. And for $17.50, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.   The micheladas were the worst I've ever had anywhere! The red juice mix they use is nasty. Again, not worth it and way over priced!!  My gf ordered the carne asada it she had to send it back because it came out cold. Then, she tried eating the second one they brought out and the meat was rubbery. It was like chewing bubble gum. And for $15.50, TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT.  Overall the place is nice, has good service and nice decors  but the food and drinks sucks the big mojo and are WAY OVER PRICED. Needless to say, I won't be going back, now or ever.

    "text": "Well where do I start?   Service started out great. Even when the food was taking a bit long our waiter Noe came over and apologized and was very attentive.   The food was ok. The pre-meal chips, beans and salsa had me excited about the meal. The margarita wasn't as strong as it should have been given it's large size but it was good.   Our meal WAS going great until the large party arrived. This wasn't your average large party. No they brought little children approximately 8. Like between the ages of 2 and 6. Now I like children and can have patience when needed, within a certain limit. But when a child begins screaming, running and the parent is not even trying to control said child? But now remember I said children. At first it was just a little annoying, \"what's the sound interrupting my thoughts\" kind of annoying. But once you are aware of one screaming child it seems to amplify as the seconds go by.   Interestingly enough we realized that the parties around us were starting to become annoyed. Then the wait staff, all fidgety and and looking annoyed yet too uncomfortable to say anything, avoiding eye contact with us as if hoping by ignoring the noise it would just stop. I began to channel my friend Brianna with the occasional \"stop it!\" getting a good laugh out of my fam but it wasn't enough to make us forget about the banshee noises coming from the other room. Needless to say I could take it no longer and asked our waiter to ask the manager to please say something.   As I suspected they were too afraid to say anything. I can understand not wanting to upset a large group especially when most plates are over $10 as I have been a server and work in the service industry. However when you have children running from room to room and adults chasing them like they are wild chickens, you might want to attempt to control the situation. However the manager and Noe did come over to apologize and offer us free dessert. We couldn't be mad at him, after all you can't really control other people and their children. It wasn't his fault that they had no home training. He even bussed our table and hand delivered the dessert.   Back to the food, I had the Cimichanga de Camarones (shrimp) and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada had more flavor than my chimichanga but deep fried tortilla... My aunt had two tacos, one chicken and one beef. She said that they were missing \"the grease\" lol. She even put the spicy salsa on them to add extra flavor.   My mom and sis had no complaints they had fajitas and a chicken dish.  Free dessert or not a spoon should always be offered with ice cream. Especially when it's yummy chocolate cake and vanilla!   All in all we could have a great experience and should have been able to enjoy good food, drinks and conversation but unfortunately the evening was sullied by wild children and oblivious parents. We can't fault the manager on duty because the owners probably don't train proper etiquette on how to control potential bad situations.   Would we return? Maybe but not anytime soon. There's too many options in this city and to be honest we've had better Mexican food. I'm looking forward to my leftovers (in front of the couch with no screaming children) though!",

We sat down after about 5 mins the waiter came by to take out drink order I'm a sucker for a yummy Michalada but that's not what I got I got a glass with ice and lime and a bottle of beer on the side (which was left untouched) the we order our food I ordered the chicken salad in a tortilla shell and husband ordered a shrimp ceviche salad (looked awesome) so after the food arrived my dressing was left out so after 10-15mins I was able to get the attention of a waiter to have him bring it out! So disappointed with the lack of customer service ! I usually enjoy this place but what a waste of 50.00$ this visit was! Maybe if the waiters paid attention to paying customers instead of chatting he could have seen how disappointing this experience was !!",

It's obvious how much they care about making sure your dining experience won't be forgotten.  We had nachos, steak enchiladas, and steak tacos. Everything was prepared perfectly and we couldn't be happier. One more thing..I would recommend the fresh guacamole they prepare at the table. Amazing.  If you want real, authentic Mexican food, don't look any further. The menu is huge as well.",

    "text": "I love the atmosphere, food, and drinks at this restaurant. I don't often get alcoholic drinks with my meals. I have very specific restaurant settings were I feel drinks are in order - and this is one of them! I love their cadillac margarita's. I have such a difficult time in Vegas getting a margarita that is made right (i.e., not too sweet, not too sour). At Lindo Michoacan they know how to make a margarita.   My favorite item on the menu, believe it or not, is the table-side guacamole. I know, it is just an appetizer - but it is the best appetizer! I used to have an avocado tree in my backyard growing up in Miami, so I miss avocados and love guacamole that is freshly made. I have had too many guacamole's that taste pasty or bland, but not here. They spice it up to your liking - so I have them dump in the bowl of onions & jalapeno's. They also have really awesome refried bean dip that comes with the chips. It is a perfect combination for a pre-dinner appetizer that mixes scrumptiously with my margarita and entree later.  For entrees, I enjoy the chicken chimichanga, steak & shrimp fajitas, and fish street taco's. Some of the items are a little pricy. But, they serve all meals with Mexican soup and chips & salsa with refried beans. Many Mexican restaurants these days have been tacking on a separate fee for chips & salsa. So, I factor this in to the dining experience. Plus, I appreciate not being nickeled-and-dimed. When I start to feel like everything I want has a separate charge (e.g., sauces, chips, refill drink), I lose interest in the dining experience.   The restaurant does have a Mariachi band that plays at night and walks about the restaurant.  I will be back!",

    "text": "Coming from the Bay Area, where the SF Mission has some of the best Mexican food around and then living for 5 years in Socal, I thought the Vegas Mexican food experience would be very underwhelming. Lindo Michoacan has definitely changed my mind! The restaurant itself is more sprawling than other restaurants and there's a lot of different types of seating (booths, patio area, long tables, etc.). Our servers/runners were on top of it and we were never left wanting chips, salsa, bean dip, water, etc. The chicken in my enchiladas was soft and flavorful and my fiance really enjoyed the fajitas he ordered. I preferred this place over Bonita Michoacan (they might be the same owners),  where I had a Groupon, but that location was farther from us and the parking wasn't ideal. I guess the fairer comparison is against Frank and Fina's Cocina, which is right around the corner. I would say I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as much at F&F and the staff there definitely catered to the regulars a bit more, so we had to wait awhile to get worker's attention on a lot of things.  All in all, until I find a better restaurant, Lindo Michoacan will be the go-to Mexican spot.",

The guacamole tasted so fresh and had such little ingredients. All together, they used avocado, diced tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapeno; as well as dashes of salt and pepper and a squeeze of half a lime.  The shrimp fajitas came out very quickly as well. We asked for both flour and corn tortillas and it was not a problem. Will be coming back!",

There was nothing about the burrito that stood out. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst. I tried the shrimp tacos, they too were ok in my eyes. She however LOVES them. Sitting outside did help as spring nights in Vegas are always nice.  To me it didn't live up to the hype that was provided to me about this place. See for yourself",

They haven't proven to me the skill to do anything other than shrimp. The steak was not great either. The carne asada meat used is far better seasoned & cooked than the slab served. I should've known better to order this item in a Mexican restaurant unless the head chef may have been working. We go mostly at lunch time. Sticking with tacos and burritos, table side guacamole, margaritas and it's solid 4 stars. One bad experience doesn't make for a one star review. Don't get adventurous with the menu & stick to the favorites & you shouldn't be dissatisfied. True story",

Salsa no flavor. I thought, okay...bad night. Tomato-based noodle soup was next, and luke warm with little flavor. No big deal I don't come here for that. Coca Cola carnitas were a huge disappointment. Almost had a dulled, overcooked sauce flavor. No flavor to the meat. My FIL had carnitas, completely unimpressed. My wife got shrimp fajitas and said they were, unquestioned, the worst fajitas she's ever had. My FIL'S girlfriend LOVED her bone-in ribeye, and ate every bite. No one said anything negative until the next day when conversation started casually about being very disappointed with dinner. This is a very expensive place for Mexican food - I expect high-end.

After being seated and receiving our drinks, it seemed that the waiter began to actively ignore his  largest table.  It was 35 minutes before he came back to take our order.  He would constantly visit every other smaller table multiple times before visiting us.  Waters and ice teas were rarely refilled and only after we flagged down the waiter or his assistant.  They \"forgot\" the fideo soup, until we asked about it (after seeing several smaller tables, that had arrived later, getting theirs), at which time he replied \"you did not get your soup?\".  No, we did not, as he was supposed to have served it.   The food was excellent; the steak with the cry today, cry tomorrow sauce was wicked spicy, just the way it should be.  The lobster was great, the shrimp ceviche was outstanding and the margaritas were excellent.  The staff performed a birthday song for our 1 year old, which was very nice.   Last, what cost one star, is that the dining room was horrendously hot.  It had to be 80+ degrees in there, please increase your AC.",

I knew from the initial call things were not going to go great, should have listened to myself. The meals were sub par at best and we did not get what we ordered. Even more frustrating is my phone call to Jose the supposed manager. He was just short of rude and could not have cared less that our Easter meal was ruined. Did not offer a credit or even a replacement. Due to Jose lack of caring or customer service we will not be back. Juans Flaming Fajitas and Los Cucos will now be our go to mexican restaurants. Hope you are happy Jose, you lost a long time loyal customer because you did NOT care!",

I told him it was awesome and thanked him. After I was done, he brought me another one and told me it was on the house. He said maybe they will put it on the menu.  I hope they do!",

My favorite photo opportunity is in the lobby where a coat rack holds several sombrero hanging.   The service is always friendly, accomidating and accurate! Which is huge for me right out of the gate. Their menu offers a wide selection of traditional Mexican dishes, including a vegitarian section that can easily be made vegan. (Which I did! - delicious!)  Now on to the food. Warm chips, warm bean and chilled salsa are brought to every table. Along with each main dish a bowl of vegitarian soup is brought out. All very delicious and so flavorful!  When the main courses are brought out everything is plated with creativity in mind. My table ordered the #18 combo chili reno and cheese enchilada, and the Avacados tacos. Wow!! So delicious all the way around.  ProTip: For a little spicy kick, ask for salsa on the side to drizzle over your tacos. You won't regret it!!",

We receieved complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa is not very hot but tasted good. The bean dip was not that good. I started with a strawberry Margarita on the rocks. It was very weak and tasted all like mixer. Not worth ten bucks at all.  We decided to try the tableside guacamole for starters. For nine bucks, I was hoping the person making the guacamole would look at us or say hello. The only thing he asked is if we wanted the guacamole spicy, which we said yes. It was definitely not close to anything spicy. We decided to share a carne asada quesadilla, which the cheese was fresh but the meat was very chewy and not desirable.   Finally we get to our entrees. I got the birria de chivo. Might I add..I thought it was weird the waitor would ask me if I knew what I ordered. Uhhh... yeah I know. Thanks for assuming I don't understand what my meal was. It felt like he was treating me like I'm stupid. Anyways, the broth was delicious but there were chunks of fat floating around. There was a few pieces of meat but nothing exciting. It came with a side of rice and beans. It was a whopping $20 yet the quesadilla fed me more than this disappointment. I've had great goat here in town but this experience was not good. My boyfriend ordered the chille verde, which he said was just okay.   The atmosphere was quite boring and I felt let down. The vibe was stale and it seemed like nobody wanted to be there. We barely ate our main courses and just packed everything up to go.   There are so many other places in town where the people value their customers and can cook better dishes than this place. I was really hoping for more. Too bad.",

ICK!! I had to sop up the grease with a napkin.

My husband ordered #13 and I ordered #6. The shredded chicken in both of our entrees was dry and his green chile was drab in taste with some of it being luke-warm.  The Spanish rice was not worth eating. The pricing was okay.",

    "text": "I used to love this place two years ago, and always recommend  it to friends and coworkers, but last week when I went it was kinda blah.  Pros- friendly hosts and waiters/waitresses and bus staff.  Huge menu with lots of options to choose from.   The cons are- Why start live music so early?  I came in around 5pm and the hostess sat us right by the speaker, I wanted to have dinner and a nice conversation  with my boyfriend not get a headache, maybe start the musicians a little later on like 8 or 9?  So we moved from the bar side to the main area, even with all the screaming kids it was still quieter than the band side.  That says something right there crying babies sound better than whoever was singing in the other room.  For my food I was really craving a chimichanga, a nice deep fried burrito usually with beans cheese and meat stuffed inside and melted cheese sour cream some sauce on top, yum.  What I got was a soft tortilla with just shredded chicken inside nothing else, and a bare top, nothing, no cheese, sauce, or even guacamole.  I should have went to Cafe Rio, Zabas or Chipotle it would have been cheaper.  The kicker is when we were leaving they had at least 7 different parties of people waiting to sit in the dinning area, no one wanted to sit in the bar area and listen to the live music, that side was dead so many open tables, feel bad for the server who had that dead section.",

    "text": "This review will be short and sweet.  Lindo Michoacan is a very average, non-unique, Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is as plain as you will get in offerings and flavors; meat, fajitas, tacos, beans, etc.  Nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary.  The prices are the usual for a sit down Mexican like this (around $12-$15 for a meal).  There are also some lunch specials for, I believe, under $10.  Overall, this restaurant can be skipped unless you are craving that Mexican cuisine.",

She was so incredibly friendly and went out of her way to make sure that we were happy with our food and our drinks and actually made our visit a lot of fun today. Unfortunately, you just don't get that kind of service much anymore. We love this place and will be back again and again and again.",

The fish is the freshest and the sauce is complex and flavorful with mild chiles instead of one dimensional heat found at most restaurants.   And I love the thin tasty soup with thin noodles, brings back memories of the closed Banchero's in Hayward, CA.

There are three different locations but we were in Summerlin so that was the move. You pull up and you're greeted by a big yellow storefront promising delicious Mexican cuisine inside.  Speaking of inside, you walk in and kind of get an old school cantina vibe. Lots of booth seating surround the huge bar. We were quickly seated and got our chips and dips. Yes dips, you get your standard salsa but also bean dip. For my entree I went with the Fajitas de Marranito. Lots of delicious carnitas mixed in with your standard peppers and onions served sizzling on a cast iron platter. Of course you get another plate with rice, beans, guac and sour cream. I also got two large flour tortillas which were definitely hand made. It was a mountain of food. I ALMOST cleaned my plate but man, it was a lot. Service was really good and attentive.  Being a California native, I like to think I know good Mexican food and Lindo Michoacan passed the test. The interior is very nice and the expansive menu has something for everyone. Definitely recommended!",

Cute Mexican themed restaurant with 2-3 diff areas for seating w/hispanic decor and music playing. Always better then hearing Brittney Spears. The assistant(chips & water re filler) was prompt and friendly but we thought he was out server. We waiter for awhile ready to order wondering when our waiter was coming to take our order. One thing that drives me insane is when the restaurant is dead we went 2:00pm & service is slow. You're not in the weeds so where are you?! Anyway the chicken quesadillas were tasty and decent portion. The salsa none of us were a fan of bc it was very runny and just spicy -not my fave. Wish they had a diff salsa to choose from. Chips were decent. We all got the same thing so I didn't know what anything else tastes like. Its not too close to my new place so I am still on the hunt for a place I would drive more the 10 min for lol.",

I prefer the green sauce, because I don't eat super spicy food, and their green sauce is just perfect. Dinner also comes with complimentary Fido soup. That was also delicious. My only issue was with dessert, because they don't serve the Mango cake, like at the other location does. But who needs to eat dessert? I do! I really wish they have that cake!

    "text": "Actually wanted to try this place for a while after hearing a recommendation from a physician' assistant I shadowed a couple weeks ago. She mentioned to try the one in Henderson because she said it had a very nice view looking down to Seven Hills or Anthem. However, I ended up going to the one on Flamingo instead for my friend's friend's birthday party.    The atmosphere and appearance of the restaurant was nice, both outside and inside. Very decorative and festive. Very spacious. I liked that they gave tortilla chips with salsa and bean dip to munch on while we waited for the food. Someone ordered guacamole and they actually make it in front of you at the table! That was unique. I have never seen it happened at a Mexican restaurant before. However, it was a bit sour for my taste. Too much lime was added and turned me off from continuing to eat it. They also brought out the Fideo Soup for everyone. The soup was basically like Tomato soup with noodles that reminded me of chicken noodle soup. A little sour too.   Anyways, so I ordered the Mole Poblano with Lengua de Ternera (Beef Tongue) in their special mole sauce. Omg! This beef tongue was amazing. So tender. It wasn't dry or chewy. The mole sauce was good, but I have had better mole at other Mexican places before. The star of the dish was definitely the beef tongue and I'm repeating myself again because it was delicious! If you want to try something new, please get the beef tongue dishes here. The portion was more than enough for one person as it came with rice, bean with some cheese on top, and a small scoop of guacamole on a bed of shredding lettuce. I also ordered their Tamarind drink and honestly, it tasted and reminded me of Sweetened Iced Tea.   Overall, I will definitely come back to try their other dishes especially anything with beef tongue!",

The complimentary chips and dips were not a favorite. The chips tasted like it came straight from a bag at the grocery store and was bland.   For the entree I got the carnitas plate with rice and beans and flour tortillas. I was disappointed with the whole thing. There were pieces of carnitas that was way overcooked and dry. My brother got a chicken dish that was covered in sauce. On its own, the chicken was rubbery and overcooked as well.   Sadly I do not plan on returning. Service was decent in the beginning but when it came time to get the check, that took forever. To a point where I was becoming impatient. The only thing I really liked was the Mariachi band.",

But tonight- they were as steady as any other place for dinner-  but apparently that's too much to handle because my wife, daughter and I sat waiting to order for almost 20 minutes before finally getting tired of it and starting to leave-  once a waiter saw us leaving though.....oh, then they can try to ask to help us.  On the way out I asked the \"hostess\" if I could speak to the manager-  she told me \"I'm sorry, she is too busy\".  Literally told me that I couldn't talk to the manager-  So I asked the other hostess- she was awesome and told me absolutely yes and went and got the manager who came right over.  Explained to the manager the issue that we were ignored for nearly 20 minutes and then explained the first hostess told me I couldn't talk to her........ Needless to say, even though the manager was apologetic and asked if she could make it up to us, I will unfortunately refuse to take my family to this establishment ever again.  In this city, in my opinion, you get 1 chance to make an impression and it only takes 1 time to screw up your reputation for a repeat client.  So be aware-  if there's more than 2 tables being served, you might rethink eating here- unless you have incredible patience and don't mind waiting 20 minutes just to get your order taken.",

The colorless sliced chicken breast laid on top of the greens while all the other ingredients fell to the bottom of the plate, leaving the visual of the salad BORING. It was a very disappointing salad.",

Thought Lindo would be the answer...............Not!.. Decor is nice..Went for lunch. Was promply seated which was good..then things went downhill. Was asked by four people what we wanted to drink..none was our server. Omar was a server..I think he needs to go back to making \"tents\" He could barely speak english and this must of been his 1-2 day on the job. Each thing he did, he needed to check with someone. He needed help taking our simple order. Simple order 2 Tacos and 2 Enchalidas. He couldn't seem to understand that all I wanted was 2 cheese enchilda's. He kept asking me if I wanted beef or chicken. Told him i wanted just cheese,onion and olives. After the second waiter explained it to him he seemed to finally understand. They serve you some chips,salsa and bean dip while your waiting for your order. It's ok, wish the chips were warm. They are very attenative about re-filling your beverage glass, as long as coffer or ice tea. Order arrives..Tacos...rock hard thick shell w/ dried shreded beef..I think the beef was cured in Death Valley. You also get some crispy spanish rice and re-fried beans, actually the same beans as in the bean dip with a spinkling of cheese. Enchaladas. A very garlickly sauce..All the cheese was on the outside, nothing inside..Onions and olives...none. Had to ask for them. When Omar returned he had the onions, but said they didn't have any olives. Which I found a bit strange because I saw them on a taco salad. They try to hustle you out as soon as possible. Removed the utinsils I didn't use from the table, before I was half way thru our meal. Removed the chips,salsa,bean dip when Omar presented us with our check.  Spoke w/ the general manager before I left about our experience. He said he was sorry and would work with our server. But I have no doubt he was just blowing me off. Offered to comp me a future meal. Assured him that was not necessary as I had no intention of ever eating at one of their restaurants again. You'll get more bang for your buck, and better food if you go to Taco Bell...Order a platter meal..",

I've been in Vegas for a bit over 2 months. While I haven' t made the effort to go to the strip and try the festivities, I have made the effort to order a margarita at the non strip restaurants along the west side of Vegas with no satisfaction. But I came here on a suggestion by a friend and I have to say that I have found my new margarita place. That's not to say that their drinks are their only point of recognition. There food is delicious and a fairly diverse menu. But what really impressed me, outside of the drink, was the service. All of the service staff was attentive and friendly. I wasn't stuck with my server, everyone made an effort to check up on the table. Whenever we needed something, it was addressed right away. I would highly recommend this to any locals or tourists wanting to try something outside of the strip. Come on in, order some food, and have a drink!",

    "text": "If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. Other places that boast authenticity usually cater a more \"tex-mex\" palatte. Lindo Michoacan is the real deal. Though it is supposed to be \"gourmet\" food, the reality is that it straight-forward Mexican food. It is what most Mexicans eat at home, which is why it is a nostalgic place to go if you're Mexican. The food is well seasoned, and it is very similar to what you would get in Mexico. By this, I mean that the chef does not randomly use cumin and cilantro, like other places. I ordered the Milanesa, which was done to perfection, and the rice and beans that came as side dishes were perfect. My husband ordered the Carnitas, and they were also cooked very well, and perfectly seasoned. Before you are served entrees, you are treated with chips to dip in salsa and refried beans. The chips were sub-par (I would have expected freshly fried \"totopos\"), but the salsa was excellent and not ketchup-y at all. The refried beans were also delicious, and had no hint of the often confusing cumin! We shared a Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was very good, except for the tortillas. I would have expected home-made flour tortillas, but instead we got huge, burrito-style flour tortillas that almost put me off the entire meal. But, since the food was so good, I was willing to overlook this major detail. Further, you also get a cup of Fideo Soup, which is a Mexican noodle soup. It is a very simple dish, but so many get it wrong. This one was executed perfectly. Overall, the food is excellent and authentically Mexican. The decor is tacky, but so are most places in this town!",

The same foods are now better.   There are still some things on the menu that are a bit bland, or a bit overdone in some particular aspect, but there are others that I've had many times in the past and not really enjoyed (there were just the least-bad option) that I have tried here recently and were quite improved. One specific example is the corn tortilla chicken quesadilla on the appetizer menu. There is a Spanish name for it that I can't remember but it has the word Masa in it. Because of the corn tortillas, you see. These things are now AWESOME. I get them every time I come.   Overall I'm happy to be able to move this up to a 4-star, and whether it's just this one location that is improving or it is a company-wide effort, I applaud it and hope that it continues.",

I had the chicken Rebeca, also a chicken breast but with cooked with fresh cactus strips, onions, cilantro, and cubed tomatoes with a bit of chopped jalapeno.    We both enjoyed our dishes.  I was surprised that my wife liked the almond in her dish.  She's generally been averse to such additions to food.  Imagine my surprise!  I enjoyed the cactus with my chicken.  Both dishes had good flavors of fresh ingredients.  For dessert, we had their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was more than enough for two people. The cake was a round shaped and was filled with a liquid chocolate and was much like a lava cake.  The ice cream had caramel drizzled on top.  I'm not sure why we don't come here more often.  It's close to home and it's very good.  Service was excellent!",

The food here is delicious.The ensalata marinara is probably my favorite salad here. The avocados and shrimp in it are a very fresh combination. Gallo Al Mojo De Ajo is a great dish for all garlic lovers. Definitely try the fried ice cream, but get it to share with someone, the portion is very large. They have a large variety of flavored margaritas which are great!",

We came on a Friday night, so it was expectedly busy. Unfortunately, management elected to have a large party in the dining room. It sounded like Chuck E Cheese. 8-11 year old children running through the dining room with absolutely no regard for the other patrons. Not one server or employee said a word to the party (which isn't surprising when they're charging an automatic gratuity). Conversation across the table was impossible because it was so loud. Total let down as we'd heard decent things about this place and we enjoy Mexican food.",

You might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you don't happen to have bat vision. Service is great. The moment we walked in the door, the hostess greeted us warmly and seated us at a table of our choosing. A moment later we were seated our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chips, respectively. Our drinks never went empty and our server was always ready to fulfill all our requests.   It's definitely not my favorite Mexican food in town, the spice level is definitely toned down and I wish the flavors were just a little more dynamic. I have ordered quite a few things off the menu and have never really been blown away flavor wise, but it's definitely solid. On this occasion, I ordered a shredded chicken burrito, which was huge for the price. It definitely needed more flavor, but it was still a pretty good meal.   I'd be back, if I'm in the area again... I'll just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the side.",

I always order the bacon wrapped shrimp, which is excellent and recommend to everyone but on this visit I ordered something more traditional.Today I stepped out of the box and ordered the Fajitas de Res.  Muy Bueno!  The beef,peppers and onions were great.  They used to provide more  flour tortillas but on this order there were two, and they will give you more if you ask. The tortillas were fresh. All the flavors were good, not too salty but just right.  The order comes with rice, refried beans, which were really good, plus a tablespoon of sour cream and guacamole.  For under $20.00 you can not but leave full.  The tables were clean, and a little dark inside at the booths. (That makes it hard to read the menu). The staff were courteous and the service was pronto.  From the time you place an order it arrives within fifteen minutes.    On this visit they did not bring their opener of a Fideo Soup cup, I didn't know if that is something they no longer do but I didn't miss it since I don't think it was meal stopper.  Over the years of going to any Lindo I have never been disappointed.  I recommend to all for its' value and good food.",

All smiles no matter what any of us threw at the staff. Mind you we were a wedding party of about 50 people. They were prepared and handled our very large group with ease. Now, the food. Just a touch on the bland side. Not to worry though. There was plenty of salsa and seasoning on the table to spice things up. Normally, I would be critical about ok bland food. But this review is about the restaurant as a whole. If the food was better it would've gotten 5 stars. It's an easy fix. Don't be afraid of salt in the kitchen guys. It's our friend most times.

Their soup is SO yummmy   Service is VERY nice and REALLY fast   They are a little pricey though on their regular menu.",

It wasn't, the service was terrible, had to wait for our orders to taken, had to wait along time for our orders to be delivered, had to hunt  for refills and then waited a long time for the check.  Food,$$, the avocado dip was very bad, very strong taste of onions, the avocados were very bland. I ordered the beef taco combo plate, it was very plane, not the taste you paid for.My wife had beef on skewer, the taste was fine, until she found a very small chrome ring, about 1/8in. in size mixed into the meat, they didn't charge for her meal.  The couple that had been here before, had to add bowls of chilli sauce to make it taste good.  Food at a fast food stand tasted a whole lot better, and at a fraction of the cost.",

No lettuce, or tomato, salsa, or options for salsa,  The chicken was dry & bland.  Then they give you a small scoop of rice (about 5 tbsp) clumped (did I mention no seasoning) We actually had to put salt on our food!  and the beans are powdered!  We didn't see one bean. The Chips & Salsa = well the chips were good but the salsa=Gross! Nothing is homemade, the food is frozen then warmed.  The only item homemade is the table-side guacamole.  And the service, the waiters acted is if we're bothering them lol...Utterly disappointing and seriously overpriced for the quality of food and service you receive.  When I first came to LV I was taken to the original LM on Eastern and loved it!  But now that they have added locations, this place has gone seriously down hill!  What happened??? Service=horrible, Food=disgusting, Price=The price didn't match the quality.  Will never return!!!!",

    "text": "I hit Lindo Michoacan up with a few gal pals because we needed to down some margaritas.  Now I knew going in that they have a mariachi band , but sometimes it got so loud by our table that we found ourselves yelling in our conversation. on the plus side they have a huge menu , so many options to fish , chicken, vegetarian and your common Mexican food favorites. For my starter I chose the fideo soup, I love it with fresh lime squeezed in, its like a Mexican noodle soup with a tomato base. I grew a bit irritated for as long as it took for our waitress to get the lime i kept asking for. For dinner i chose the chili relleno with a beef taco combo plate which was very good, too much food with the rice and beans after munching on chips and salsa before dinner. I tried the Sangria which seemed too strong without much flavor, needless to say I have had better. My next drink was a bit better a margarita on the rocks , always a good choice. We decided to push it and have dessert , a caramel torte and also sopapillas which were my favorite sprinkled with honey they are like a square fried donut with cinnamon and sugar. SWEET!  Needles to say we must have had a good time because we were one of the last tables to leave on a Friday night. I would have given more stars if our waitress had been a bit more on her game and our drinks were mixed better.",

The restaurant was oddly empty considering we arrived at noon and left around 2pm (in fact, there was no one there by the time we left.) The menu had tons of choices and even a special \"vegetarian\" section, highlighting the few meatless dishes available.  I ordered vegetable fajitas. They weren't bad. The vegetable choice was great, but it was lacking flavor. I suppose it was \"healthier\" that way, but if you're going in that direction, why not offer wheat or whole grain tortillas?  The prices were pretty high, but the servings are large enough for 2-3 small meals. The service was outstanding--I think I was offered a drink refill at least five or six times. My boss joked that we were getting great service because he had four women with him. He may have been right. I'm okay with that.  Oh, and if you order guacamole, someone will make it right in front of you, to your specifications. That was pretty neat.  I probably won't return, but it wasn't bad--just not outstanding.",

    "text": "Winner of The Starbucks Syndrome Award. What is this award? Well everyone knows that Starbucks serves the worst coffee on planet earth and charge outrageous prices for same yet they continue to pack customers in for no other reason than the coolness factor and name recognition.  The same goes for this restaurant. It's in a well-to-do area without a lot of eating establishments and the people go because it's convenient and they can afford to throw their money away.   Hence, if you are looking for a loud, noisy, place with mediocre food that costs as much or more than eating on the strip, this is your place!   From the worst salsa I have ever eaten in my life to the greasy chips, I told my wife then we should run, not walk out of there. The average plate costs $15-20, which is simply absurd for what you get ....bland food with a lot of breading and little meat at a cost that will allow you to go to much nicer restaurants for a cheaper price.  Simply unbelievable that this place is in business. And, just like Starbucks, it just goes to show that American standards have become increasingly low compared to other places in the world. Hence, we throw away our money and don't hold people/establishments accountable for their actions and, in fact, reward them for ripping us off just as we do our politicians.",

They have a certain way of doing it but you can feel free to make a suggestion about certain ingredients to cater to your liking. i let them do their thing and it never disappoints.  The food was great, we had a Chile Relleno/ Tamale combo. The Chile Relleno was really good. The pepper was cooked just right, nice and tender but not mushy. The stuffing in the Chile was delicious. The Tamale was great a beef tamale and I could just sit there and eat that all night.  We also ordered a Gallo al Mojo de Ajo. It was a chicken breast cooked in a garlic wine sauce. I cut up that chicken, tossed it in a flour tortilla with the rice, beans, and guacamole and I was happy. Also ordered a Tamale with that, I think that is going to be a permanent a la carte order from now on.  Up next was the Banderillas de Torro. Grilled Beef skewers with onion and green, red, and yellow peppers. A little tough on the meat but tons of flavor. Good stuff.  Service is half of the experience for me. I can go somewhere with excellent food but if the service is lacking it's ruined or I can go somewhere where the food is OK but as long as the service is great, I will have a good experience. This place is a no brainer if you're in the mood for good Mexican food and excellent service.",

I don't understand how it is possible to screw up guacamole that us Made with\" fresh \" ingredients but apparently it very easy !   I got a three item combo , everything did not have good flavor . The chile relleno was covered in the same red tomato sauce as the chicken enchilada that has dry chicken meat . The beef taco was the best part of my meal and was comparable to Roberto's   My husbands meal was the worst part of our whole experience . His beef dish wasn't edible as every few bites had so much fat I had to literally ask for a new napkin just to spit the meat I couldn't swallow into . Who serves meat like this at an establishment that is so well known ?!?! I have literally had better quality meat from don tortaco ! WhAt a disappointment !   The only thing I can say was good about our experience was the service , our sever was very attentive and it was not his fault a \"Mexican food \" place was serving food that should not have been approved by the FDA .",

Normally musicians will move around so you can enjoy a song and then carry on a conversation!  After repeatedly asking where our dinner was, witnessing others receive their dinner who were seated after us and ONE AND A HALF HOUR later we gave up and walked out. I believe we exhibited great patience as it was Cinco de Mayo but it was a DISGRACE.  Extremely disappointed and will not recommend or ever return.",

    "text": "Man, I dont know what it is but lately I have been having bad experiences. Last place I went to had good food but bad service. Here I had both bad service and bad food. Im hoping the next place I go to I dont have bad anything.   So me and the wifey come here on thursday around 9:15 pm for a late dinner. Since these guys close at 11, we were thinking we should get decent service and decent food as well.  What I got was the Carne Asada Plate ($18.95). It is a thinly cut of New York steak. Comes with refried beans, rice, guacamole, and flour tortillas. My wife got a Shredded Beef Enchilada ($4.50) off the a la carte menu.  Before our order comes out, we are given a basket of chips, bean dip, and salsa to munch on while we waited. I guess we were really hungry because we devoured it in like a minute. Like all other Mexican restaurants, I assumed these things were endless. As our server walked by a couple times to refill our drinks, he never refilled the the chips and dip. So maybe I was wrong about my assumption. Until I saw the next table get another batch. Hmmmm. Sad to say the chips and salsa were the only things with great flavor.  We get our main entrees and it looks delicious. But turns out the steak was bland. The only things that had any kind of flavor on my plate were the grilled jalapeno and small spoonful of guacamole. I had to dip the steak in what little left of the salsa that was provided with the chips. My wife's enchilada was ok but it was obvious that it was microwaved as evidenced by the some of the enchilada sauce surrounding the burrito was crusted. You know when any kind of sauce gets microwaved too long? Yup. Thats how parts of the sauce were.   Service was just a tad below mediocre. I think the table next to us got chips and salsa refilled twice. Not to say that we could of ate that much as well but like I said before I was used to these places constantly refilling those things without hesitation. It also took a while for us to get our check and for the receipt to come back so I can sign it.   So in closing, maybe we just came at the wrong time? Maybe we need to get to the original location off of Desert Inn? If we do, hopefully the food and service will be much better. Until then, im not sure if I want to come back to this particular location.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #146 \"Should of just ordered chips and salsa\"",

Take them to go!   Customer service was attentive to our needs. My daughter spilling her soda, Her wanting extra sour cream, and us ordering more food after we ate. Difficult like always, but they didn't treat us differently. Food was fast and extremely hot. I like that,  no messing around.   The combos are big portions so watch out, if you eat correct portion size then share with a friend. the tacos are full of meat, and fully loaded. The quesadillas are really cheesy, too much cheese if you ask me, but my daughter loved it. The chile relleno isn't spicy, full of cheese and the batter is light and fluffy. I really enjoyed it. Beans and rice are good, but you can never finish them. My advice, take them to go and order a few flour tortillas to go. Lunch tomorrow my friends!   The deserts are huge too, so be careful. We ordered the fried ice cream. Big enough for two and extremely rich. Full of chocolate sauce, whip cream any tons of ice cream fried to perfection in a crisp cinnamon batter, holy hell it's amazing. What fat girls dreams are made of.   Mexican deliciousness, we shall see you again soon.",

We were placed in the super quiet area when later we found out that in the other area there was live music! Very disappointing! I got a salad with shrimp and it consisted 90% of iceberg lettuce for $18. There was no dessert, no birthday congratulations or anything. With a big group like this we expected a way better experience. It was so quiet in the room and waiters didn't ask everyone for drink orders so people had to wait 45 min to order their first drink. Sad.",

Shame on me for keep giving them a second, third, and fourth chance...but today was the last time fo sho. It's always a hit or miss with them. We are pescaterians (because we love animals so much) so we always order the same thing, Shrimp Fajitas. Super easy. 1. They always forget to pack the guac and sour cream. 2. They've forgotten to pack the tortillas. 3. Sometimes there's literally only 2-3 shrimp and the rest is just bell peppers. 4. Today, there was chicken mixed in with the shrimp (traumatizing) which was the straw that broke the camel's back for us.....  Will never order from here again. THE END.",

    "text": "I was looking for a fantastic Mexican restaurant because a dear friend was visiting from Scotland, and she enjoys Mexican food but there isn't much of it across the pond.  So I was looking for a \"best of Las Vegas\" experience for her.  My family and I had previously been to the Desert Inn location and it was pretty good, so I thought this would be good too.  To be honest, I'm sorry I chose this restaurant.  It was \"ok\" but not the type of memorable experience I was hoping for.  The minuses:  One of my enchiladas had a cold spot in the middle.  The shredded chicken was dry and flavorless.  Someone in our party said that \"she could taste the margarita mix but not the tequila\" in the margarita.  The flan was too sweet, (yes, I know that dessert is supposed to be sweet, but it was so sweet that the rest of the flavors were overpowered.)  The service wasn't all that great.  After our table was cleared, I waited for a while and then went to go find the waiter to ask for a dessert menu.  Things like water refills and the check seemed to take a while, even though they didn't seem busy.    Normally I would have scarcely noticed these things if it were just a casual dinner out, but under the circumstances, it mattered.  It was a weeknight and a bit late, so maybe that had something to do with it.  The pluses:  The tableside guacamole is a nice touch, even though the flavor was missing something.  Cilantro?  Also the food was not overly salty, which is often a problem with Mexican food.  And of course, sopapillas.  Sopapillas are always a plus.  We'll probably be back now and then if we are in the area, but not for special occasions or guests.",

The menu has a little bit of everything, from quesadillas and burritos to menudo and lengua. They also have a happy hour from 2-5 in the afternoon with 2 for 1 cocktails. Just wish they'd include appetizers as it would probably entice me to go a little more often.  The restaurant itself feels cozy and comfortable (we always sit in the bar area or on the patio). They also typically have some sort of live entertainment. You can't go wrong with most of the appetizers they offer but I really enjoy their plates. And of course the margaritas are delicious. One of the better options around for sit down Mexican food.",

This place has been here a lot of years, at least passed 31 plus...the owner I've known since the mid nineties when I worked at the cable company. Very nice guy and strict with his restaurants food, presentation and it shows!

    "text": "One of the three Lindo Michoacan locations in Las Vegas, this one can definitely hold its own. While not quite as good as its sister locations, this is the closest one to me so I eat here often. The signature stellar Lindo service is here (really, how do they always manage to give 5 star service no matter the time of day) and the food is delicious.   I love the queso here, it's basically a big plate of REAL melty cheese baked with charred poblano peppers and served with Lindo's delicious homemade flour tortillas! I love the tortillas here and I frequently eat my weight in them (bye bye low carb diet). The complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip is always a hit too. The food here is just delicious. You can't go wrong with many of the dishes (although sometimes the chicken quality in some of the specialty dishes is a little bit rubbery and \"off\" -- don't know why, but it has happened a couple of times at this location). I've never had an issue with the chicken quality in the chicken fajitas or with any of the seafood or beef dishes. The guacamole is worth getting, and they have yummy Diet Pepsi and fresh brewed iced tea. Again, the focus is on quality and service.   The prices are higher than your average Mexican restaurant but I think it's worth it. This location runs incredible lunch deals and specials during the week, and the kitchen is fast so it's the perfect spot for a quick workday lunch.   The hostesses will automatically try to seat you in the bar section of the restaurant if you are a party of just adults. There's an extra special atmosphere in this area on weeknights when a dude in a sparkly red shirt plays a synthesizer and sings pop songs in broken English. It's pretty rad and it's not too loud, which is nice. If you are looking for a quieter experience, ask to be seated in the other part of the restaurant.   Note that the parking lot here is deceptive and is often overflowing with cars. Even if it appears packed, do not be discouraged and assume there's a wait -- go in anyway. I've never had to wait here even on a very busy Saturday night.",

There was a singer singing some Latino favorites which I recognize the music but don't speak Spanish.  It was nice to have some entertainment.  It was all I could do to not get up and dance.  The chips, refried beans and salsa help prep you for the amazing food to come.  I just had two grilled fish tacos since I ate so many chips.  It was all I needed for a small meal.  The grilled fish was seasoned with the Baja seasoning, served with avocado and cabbage.    Since Loren F. speaks Spanish, we got instant rapport with Oscar, our waiter.  He was very attentive to us and we had everything we needed.  It's not necessary to speak Spanish there as I have been many times and always had a wonderful experience.  Lindo Michoacan is my all around favorite Mexican restaurant.  Everything on the menu is fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Can't wait til my next visit.",

The two margaritas we ordered had a horrible aftertaste - like rotten limes - undrinkable!  We had no less than six servers come to take our order.  The steak fajita had almost no steak and was $19 for nothing.  The Red Snapper was quite good, but the sauce was as yucky as the salsa, bitter and not very spicy.

When we're really hungry we start off with their \"QUESADILLA DE HARINA\" - flour tortilla with Monterrey jack cheese, sour cream, and guacamole ($7.25).  I get the \"FLAUTAS\" dinner - 6 fried rolled corn tortillas with beef, sour cream, and guacamole.  It also comes with rice and beans ($12.95).    My boyfriend gets different things each time, but we have yet to order something that we did not like.  You get complimentary chips and salsa.  Their salsas are so good.  We came here a few months ago on my boyfriend's birthday.  Our server sent over the mariachi band.  They made my bf wear a sombrero as they played a song for him and then made him take a shot of tequila.  It was a really fun experience.   The drinks are a little pricey.  I want to say the coronarita alone is like $18, if I remember correctly.",

Their fresh tableside guacamole is amazing and probably the best I've had in Vegas. I rate a Mexican restaurant by how well they make their guacamole and carne asada. Since this place gets both items very right all the time, it's easily one of my favorites.  If you come here, you have to know what to order. Don't go to a Mexican restaurant and order a simple burrito or quesadilla. There's really not much you can do with those items. They're going to taste the same almost everywhere. You might as well just stick with Del Taco or Taco Bell. See what everyone else is raving about on here and try those items instead.   * One interesting memory there was when I went for a birthday party and the server along with a legit mariachi band came to our table to give the birthday boy a shot of tequila. After their little song and dance, they tilted his head back and poured the tequila down his throat! Hilarious!",

We ended up sitting in a cozy booth in a back room.  I noticed a smell right away. Like a dirty dishcloth...we should have left right then.  Anyway the best and honestly only good part of the meal was the table side guacamole.   Hubby got a grilled vegetable wet burrito and I got the guac tacos. Bean dip was bland, hubby's burrito the vegetables were old and burnt, like they were re-grilled. My tacos...the rice was bland and hard...the beans again were bland.  I ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt... and it tasted like what Pine-Sol smells like...not good. Zero tequila taste.   The three stars were for the guacamole alone...otherwise this place is zero stars...but honestly I will not return for the guac. The place just plain smells :(",

Now the plate is only 1/2 full. We just went last night. Ordered the same two entrees we just about always order. One being the fish tacos, which have always been my favorite. But this time the fish had a funny smell & taste and the rice & beans were pretty much non existent. This place has become the Denny's of Mexican food. And it's all very bland. Sad.

It's got a great ambiance, a live musician playing the keyboard to Mexico's greatest hits (judging by my pal's enthusiasm for the songs), and delicious food.  At one point, some people even got up to dance the bachata - winner, winner, chicken dinner.  Pros: Delicious food \"Mexican approved\" (and I mean \"Mexican from Mexico City,\" not, \"this one friend I have who is kind of tan and I think his last name is Garcia or something.\") Well-decorated Good ambiance - great for groups or a romantic date - a rare combo! Friendly and prompt service The dude playing the keyboard had a good voice.  (If you have to listen to live music, it had better be pleasant, that's all I'm saying!)  Cons: A little spend-y for a Mexican restaurant - I usually think of Mexican as cheap eats. A little loud for first-date or similar chit-chat. No \"mild\" salsa option at the table - I'd say it was medium, which is cool for me, but might not be everyone's bag.  Or bowl.  Or container of your choice.  *A side note: The service was great, but they did forget to bring my side of guacamole, I forgot to mention the oversight, and when the bill came I forgot to check and see if I was charged for it - double fail on me!  Overall, this place is a win, and I will totally go again.",

Between our waiter, the server assistant and the manager, who all visited our table, we experienced impeccable service. The service alone earns a shiny star!  The restaurant is fancy-schmancy in an Epcot way. (Point on Andrew M!) They also have a nice patio with misters. We decided to sit inside, and I think it is a tad dark in there. I had to squint to read the menu.  After some squinting, I remembered one of the reasons we don't go out for Mexican too often- In comparison to my days in Georgia, Mexican spots are more expensive than I anticipate. $18-20 entrees were all over the place.  This isn't a Speedy Gonzalez combo type of establishment. My husband finally selected a fried whole fish, which for around $15 was a great deal, and I went with the vegetarian enchiladas with green sauce.   The whole fish was a sizeable tilapia that the husband thought was terrific, and it came with three sides. I was particularly happy that the veggie enchiladas weren't cheese, but actual sauteed vegetables. The tangy green sauce was the perfect complement. And, each of our dishes were under $15, so I felt like we were able to find some value options on the menu, especially given that each comes with a tasty cup of a simple fideo soup.   We had a delicious meal with great service and all the bean dip we could handle. That is a success in my belly.",

    "text": "I had wanting to try this place for a while after hearing how good it was.  Service started with the waiter bring chips, salsa, and bean dip.  There was something noticeably absent from both the salsa and the beans: salt.  The beans were incredibly bland.  I mixed the salsa and beans together and added salt, and this resulted in a much more flavorful appetizer.    I wanted to try the salsa used in the pollo llora hoy, llora manana, so the waiter brought a dish of it to the table.  My girlfriend and I quickly emptied the bowl onto our food.  By itself, it did not have too much flavor because it needed salt, but it was a nice addition to other food.  In this quantity, it had a kick but was not terribly scorching.  If it was served in the amount that can be found in the pollo llora hoy, llora manana, I can imagine the heat would build up to an ass-kicking level.  Being a big fan of mole poblano, I ordered the pollo en mole.  I was hoping and praying that it would be made from scratch and not come out of a jar of Dona Maria.  Thankfully, it was from scratch and was quite good.  The chocolate was used to round out the flavors of the chiles not to make the mole sweet. It is definitely one of the best moles I have had in a US restaurant.  The pollo came with beans on the side, which like the bean dip, needed salt.  My girlfriend order the sopitos, half with carne asada and half with chorizo. She enjoyed them but needed to add salt.  The service was great.  The waitstaff was quick to fill up our drinks and bring us anything we needed.  Overall, I would eat there again, but  what prevents me from giving it 5 stars is the under seasoning.  In truth, such egregious under seasoning probably does not even deserve 4 stars.   I am not really into salty foods, even buying reduced-sodium products at the market, but salt is the building block of flavor and without it food is flavorless.  Here, it did not seem like the cooks used any.  At least there was salt at the table.",

I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious but messy. Our food took way to long to prepare and we could not figure out why as there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at 11AM. Usually the food and service is really excellent but not at this location. I prefer the Henderson location.",

    "text": "I just love mariachis! The food could've been horrible, the service could've sucked, and I still would have had a great dinner. But it didn't. As always, we had a fantastic dinner with guac made tableside, wonderful fideo soup, tasty salsa, and unlimited bean dip!   I do feel the menu is a bit pricy and excellent Mexican food can be found elsewhere for half the price, but being serenaded with Cielito Lindo while sipping on a margarita makes for one unforgettable night!   Lindo has somewhat of a cult following and my cult friends get angry when I say that Lindo ain't all that - but I honestly don't believe it's the best Mexican restaurant in town.   Their lunch menu is a better value, so if you've heard the hype about how awesome this place is, you can get a decent lunch, drink included for around $10.",

    "text": "My favorite Mexican restaurant by far in Vegas. I love how (cliche) the place is decorated inside. The servers are always friendly. Guacamole always made fresh! The Fideo soup prior to your entree always tastes delicious! I love the salsa, beans, and chips they give you to munch on while you wait for your meal. As for the Entrees I always order Enchilada combo or Chicken Fajitas. Always great! And on birthdays it is so much fun! They put a sombrero on you, sing, give you a tequila shot (if you're of age) and dessert. The Churros are a must if you love sweets! They have a live band there and it's a very fun, friendly atmosphere. I always recommend this place and have been going for years :)",

    "text": "I have eaten at this Lindo about 5 times.  I have never been disappointed.  I usually order the Pollo Sarandeados with flour tortillas.  It is always good.  I cut up the chicken, put it in the flour tortillas with some guac, rice, and salsa - it is awesome.  The chips are always good.  The bean dip is spot on - good flavor and always warm.  I tried my daughter's quesadilla this time -  she loved it and I thought it had a good flavor.   The atmosphere is inviting - large and spacious.  The service is always friendly.  And, they had the basketball game on tonight - bonus.   I will continue to return.  This is a great place for dinner.",

    "text": "The menu is vast! Allow yourself 20 minutes to read through the 6+ pages of options.    The Summerlin location of this Las Vegas favorite is pricier than the rest.  All of the entrees are approx. $2-3 more than sister properties.  That said, the portions are more than fair.  Your dinner is likely to provide leftovers for an additional meal.  All the meals come with a tasty little cup of tomato fideo soup.  I would go just for this hot deelish little soup cup.  A house margarita is $10 - that's a bit steep for off strip.  On our most recent visit, we started with fresh guacamole.  It is fresh; and mixed up right at your table.  I dined on the coca cola carnitas.  The tender chunks of pork are coated in a rich, dark, flavorful sauce.  They will curb your craving for delicious pork!  My husband was quite pleased with his fish tacos, and my sister in law was ga-ga for her steak tampiquena and cheese enchilada.  Smiles all around.    Dinner was $110 for 4 with 1 marg, 1 beer, 1 tea, 1 guac, and 4 entrees.  Like I mentioned, a bit high on price but high on portion and flavor as well!",
