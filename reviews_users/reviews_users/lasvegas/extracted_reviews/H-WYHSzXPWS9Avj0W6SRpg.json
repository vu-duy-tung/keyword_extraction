In the early years buffets were great and pricing was awesome not the case as the years went on. We went to the Excalibur buffet in the early years but stopped going because we were not impressed with their selection. I noticed this year it was the new buffet so we gave it a try again. Wrong decision again!!! The food was cold as a matter of fact the lady was complaining to the chef on the floor...that is when we should have ran. The meats were cold, potatoes, etc. now onto desserts I said to my husband well the dessert should be cold because everything with this buffet is cold. Wrong!!! We had those little ting desserts in a cup and oh my god they were warm. The jest here is what should be cold was warm and what should warm was cold.",

I do not believe that any of the chefs have actually been tasting the slop they are putting out.  Not even a decent salad bar.  They should buy mashed potatoes from Popeye's out in the food court, at least Popeye's taste like potatoes.  Save your money, go elsewhere.",

I would recommend especially if you are on a budget, most food is very expensive in Vegas so overall is a good deal.",

To be honest when i did my first walk around it was disapointing nothing really caught my eye and some of the dishes looked like they just scraped food onto a plate and brought it out so i grabbed a little bit of everything. I even over heard another family tell there kids not to get a plate because there going to go somewhere else. Me and my wife were both super surprised once we started eating. everything was very tasty and for the price it's not that bad. If youre into seafood this is a must go they had a nice selection of seafood. The deserts were pretty weak they did have a nice selection of sugar free if youre into that kind of thing.",

We plan on going for dinner tonight, and I can't wait to see what choices they have.

We have been at this buffet 5 years ago and it's huge difference between now and before. Better quality food and apperance. I used 2 for one voucher from myvegas rewards and comps from mlife card - total paid $1.87 for 2 of us. Pretty epic deal right there!! Brunch time -little bit of lunch/dinner/breakfast foods. Eggs Benedict were really good, perfectly made bacon, scrambled eggs were good and huevos con Ranchero along with other mexican breakfast food (can't think how it's called) but it was all delicious. Made to order crepes station is die for- I had 4 different ones but strawberry whipped cream was my favorite one. Freshly made whipped cream and diced strawberries. Waffles and pancakes were thick and fresh, chesse blitz with strawberry topping yum yum yum. Overall we were shocked how good food and service was. There is bar inside if you want alcoholic beverages  (extra charge) and soft beverage station with coffee, tee, sodas and 4 variety of juices-orange, apple, grapefruit and pomegranate something mix. Worth trying that place out. We were pleased. Longer line to get in but if you have pearl or above mlife card then you skip the line (we did yay).",

Though always huge, the quality of the food has become similar to a Home Town Buffet and lots of the seating shows it's age- needing to be replaced.  This buffet is paired with the Luxor with an all in one option. Seems like a good deal but it really isn't. The lines used to be an hour long and wrapped around the thunder from down under. The last time I was there there wasn't a line as I feel people who came here before realized what I realized many moons ago. I was a fan before as they used to serve horchata but those days are long gone.   If you happen to be staying at the hotel and do t want to eat at the food court, then you'll be satisfied with this place. Eat away!",

She was rude and quite short with me, I expressed my displeasure to her and another employee chimed in to say that \"she was doing five things at once, so maybe that's why I found her to be rude\".  Oh I'm sorry , so that is an excuse to be rude, got it. I'm sorry that I'm trying to spend $64 and your attitude sucks, that's OK, you're multitasking.  This  completely soured my experience and and doubt I'll be back.",

Word of advice don't be fooled with the desserts, they look delicious but everything was stale and tasted like it had been sitting there for days. Not impressed at all, don't waste your $30 on this place.",

They have a large variety of desserts and someone making fresh crepes, adding ingredients that you want.

So usually buffets include the mimosas, well not here at the Buffet at Excalibur. The food tasted old and my chicken was pink inside! That's when I lost my appetite really... Such  a bummer cause I saved my appetite for this all day. Save your money and eat elsewhere like Bucca or Friday's, otherwise you'll end up disappointed.",

Waitress did not refill drinks, but did promptly take away dirty plates. Overall, the food was pretty mediocre and I expected better quality for $35 dinner buffet pricing.

I'm talking worse than bad mall food court fare.  Best item : Carvery ..although even this was too chewy for my liking.  Worst items : the Italian section, especially the dried out nasty greasy pizza.  For the dinner price you can eat really good food elsewhere in Vegas.",

He proceeded to eat and eat and eat a little bit more each time he went up to the different food stations.Finally the supervisor manager of the buffet goes up to him and says ,\"Sir sign says all you can eat - not all we have.\"  REVIEW  On Sunday February 24, 2019, I ate with a group of 5 at the Excalibur weekend brunch. The cost was around $25 with tax and we had 2 for one coupons which cut the price in half.  I personally do not think any buffet is worth $25 dollars unless you are REALLY a big eater and have the need to shovel that much food in your stomach in one sitting.   BREAKFAST The eggs were watery, the bacon very good, the waffles were sitting there too long, BUT best of all was the Omelet station made to order. This was abundant fresh and you could have a variety of ingredients in your omelet including spinach, mushrooms, bacon, onions and much more. Worth at least half what you paid.   LUNCH The shrimp was good they also had mussels, a variety of Asian food, Prime Rib and other meats.  DESERTS You can watch them make you a Crepe but truly the deserts were a huge disappointment with boring choices and a variety of selections on par with any article titled \"Worst desserts in America\".  Me, I would rather go to the Denny's on the strip and for 5.99 get Pancakes, French Toast, Bacon and eggs. ALL for the above price. A far cry from 25 dollars.   I understand the need to not want to walk too far and eat in your hotel. But you will pay for it.   Happy Tomorrow",

There was roast beef being served RAW. Completely raw and bloody, one of the plates I didn't get a picture of had what looked like guts all over the place. We called the manager and she came over but all she did was offer us a free round of drinks. The chef continued to serve the RAW roast beef also, completely disgusting and would definitely never come again. Not worth spending the money. Also in the photo you can see the actual blood spatter on the plate.",

Again, when it sits out for hours it gets stale.",

Very friendly up front, the servers are on top of refills or if you need anything like extra napkins, etc and the workers at the carving/omelette station were great!  But the food.......just felt like I was back at my high school but instead of you standing in line to get one thing, you had access to all the school had to offer. The meats were cooked well but absolutely flavorless....tasted really bland and dry. Even the omelette station that looked promising had no flavor even after putting in ham, bacon and other vegetables. The other stations just tasted like cheap takeout....  Even with a discount, I was still very unhappy with the amount I paid for this buffet. I understand it's a buffet and the quality of food goes down but you know it's bad when I wish I was back in my high school cafeteria.....",

The dinner buffet was even worse I enjoyed only the soup and salad I got, I got a piece of chicken from the \"American\" section and make my salad into a chicken salad and it was good. Tried the Mexican food it was tough to chew (the taquitos) the looked like the kind you buy in the frozen food section at your local grocery store but we're not easy to eat I think I had 2 bites and gave up. I was really disappointed in the lack of options for dinner. Got the fettuccine Alfredo from the \"Italian\" section it wasn't good and I would of got a slice of pizza but they were all burnt. The only other good thing I got was a crepe at the dessert section.",

One of them went out of her way to get my son some ice cream while he was watching his movie. We appreciated the gesture. She also came around to ask if everything was okay, if we needed anything, she would pick up out plates. The front ladies that let you in were a bit rude but whatever.

Quality of the food wasn't bad for a buffet although I did expect a lot more variety with it being a casino buffet.   I came for the crab legs though and they had it in abundance which was good. What was not, was the wait and that you had to go to a separate station once you got the crab legs to have them warm it up in a pan of water. So two waits possible. The legs were nice and meaty. The table did not have bowls for the shells or wet wipes for after.   Wish I had saved room for the fresh crepes that are made to order which looked tasty. Plates were cleared from the tables promptly which was nice. Desserts were delicious. They had little cups of tiramisu and flan. A nice selection everything looked good on the dessert section.",

There wasn't really anything BAD but some of the stuff I tried was the Italian station and the Chinese station. Both had a handful of delicious options to choose from. But the desert station is where it earns its stars. The banana cream puff, cheesecake, canoli in a cup, and fresh made to order crepes were all great. You get your own beverage in this place..... and they had chocolate milk. The only negative I can think of is when I was getting more food, someone cleared away my silverware and I had to ask for more.",

The mesquite roasted chicken was dry. The so called \"roast beef\" (pictured) is not your typical roast beef you get from a regular restaurant. It's disgusting. There's so much nerves through the meat it's not even chewable. The Mexican rice was so bland. It's like the store bought microwaveable uncle bens. Nasty! The lemon pepper piccata sauce chicken was very dry and my knife wouldn't cut through it without putting some good elbow grease into it. The salad was literally the only good thing. The deserts were waaaaaay to rich and sweet. Not enjoyable at all. My wife and I don't gamble but we gambled on this place and we lost!!!",

The desert bar did not have a quality assortment,  and there was no pie that wasn't sugar free.   My husband did love the crepes though.     We did get to try some new foods we had not had before, like beaded shrimp and sushi.   The crawfish look super creepy to eat though.

I did not have high hopes because you don't really hear much about Excalibur's buffet and I've been there before without it being memorable. We were running real behind and our breakfast ended up being more of a brunch/lunch .  Shock of shockers it ended up being GREAT!  I was able to put together an AMAZING BLT with really good bacon from breakfast, bread out for toast, and spinach and cherry tomatoes from the salad bar.  I also put together a GREAT spinach, red onion, beet, craisins, pepitas & goat cheese salad.  The best thing is that they not only have a crepe station, but they have neverending rice krispie treats!  YUM!  After that, I was looking forward to the following evening for dinner so I was pretty disappointed when it was just not very good the next day.  There wasn't anything interesting to make a salad with although I did get them to drag out the craisins.  None of the meat was interesting, although they  had a beautiful display of roasted vegetables at the carving station that were only for show, not for eating.   Man, why doesn't any buffet do roasted vegetables like that???   That would be amazing!  Anyway, I don't recommend the dinner, but hitting up the breakfast to lunch changeover is AWESOME.",

You really can't go wrong with clam chowder and cheesecake to begin with though. The beef steak was decent. Ice cream is the best here, only complaint is the waitresses are rude.",

I wish I would have reviewed the reviews before coming here. Sad to see a major hotel on the strip having such a crappy selection of a buffet. The food has been setting out for a while. I got some chicken and it was hard to cut. I didn't even eat it. The                  \" waitstaff\" are really just bussing the tables. I'll be walking to one of the best buffets here in Vegas from now on. \"B\". Sorry MGM",

The good: The lady checking us in to the buffet was nice and explained our options i.e. one time vs all day. It was a free meal.  The buffet offered a very reasonable selection of items from fruit/salad to traditional American  breakfast items to potatoes and pastries.  The selections include an omelet station and a variety of non-pork protein items.   The beverage station has soda, milk,  juices,  coffees (including lattes and cappuccinos) and tea. The omelet guy is a beast - I watched him whip out 5 omelettes at a time for nearly 2 hours without breaking a sweat or dropping any food.   The food was edible and I stuffed myself. I liked the omelet and apple crepes. I went  back for seconds on the chicken fried steak...not that it was overly delicious - the turkey sausage links were not that tastey.  The bad: Again,  I can't complain about a free meal. The coffee was just ok. We didn't get a lot of table service - I mean its a buffet but they make sure that you know gratuity isn't included. I'm wondering what am I to tip for? It was all self serve as best as I can tell.",

    "text": "I visited this buffet twice during my visit to Las Vegas in January 2017. I had received a discount for a weekday breakfast and a weekend brunch. I ate here in one of my previous Las Vegas trips so I was familiar with the type of food offered at this buffet.  The line-up for my weekday breakfast and my weekend brunch wasn't too long. I had to wait ~15 minutes to get to the front of the line where I presented my MLife card containing my discounted meal.  As buffets go, as mentioned, I would say that it is similar to Monte Carlo's buffet (maybe a bit larger in terms of area). It is self-serve for the soft drinks and juices. The drink dispensers was exactly the same as Monte Carlo's buffet so you had Diet Pepsi, Pepsi, Root Beer, etc. The machine was not as fancy as the one at the Mirage.  I'm not sure whether I would pick Excalibur's buffet if I wanted to have a relatively inexpensive buffet (when you compare it with Strip buffets). I would probably go to Monte Carlo just as a personal preference for that type of buffet. There was nothing bad about the buffet but there was also nothing that I was overly impressed with.",

I should have been tipped off by the all day all you can eat pass for $40 however due to convienen we were willing to give this a try. While I'm glad that I was able to see the early morning vultures descending upon their pray I myself couldn't indulge. Maybe it was the constant elbowing by adults while trying to serve my daughters plate or maybe it was the lack of human grade edible food  that finally forced me to leave without eating a bite. I was able to request a refund and should be seeing it in my bank account within 3-5 business days but I'm still irritated at their ability to call this food.   By the numbers I have alternative suggestions. For our family of four, 2 adults and 2 children this buffet set us back $67. My suggestions, take a nice walk down to the Paris buffet where you can feed your family recognizable and delicious food for $75 or if your feeling really fancy try the MGM buffet for $80. Both these options are far better and worth the little extra cash.",

They won't bring you an extra plates or refill your drink....nope, just remove your plate.  Lunch is pretty much 5 steps under a golden corral buffet that's been sitting for 6 hours, dinner is EXACTLY the same crap as lunch, only they bring out shrimp. The desserts are pre-made somewhere else and frozen, just like everything else. The fact that they charge more than $4.99 is laughable.  If the buffet had not been free for my family because it was paid for through our group special we would not have gone back after the first breakfast, and even then I pretty much ate a salad and got something else somewhere else. My kids opted for pop tarts in our room instead of the buffet if that tells you anything.",

I wouldn't say anything I had was bad though. The variety was a little disappointing compared to say Mandalay Bay or Luxor's buffets and not as good of quality. I did go on crab leg night which was nice. Shrimp and muscles were good too. Had some decent pork tamales. Overall pretty decent. A little cheaper than the other buffets I mentioned so if you wanna save $10 compared to dinner at Mandalay Bay buffet then go here.",

Cicis pizza. 7-11. Totinos pizza. Zesta crackers. Carlo Rossi wine. Anything but this - save your money.",

The deserts are the best thing they offer, which is only a small part of what should be looked at.  The crab legs were dirty. Me being who I am I ate them anyways, but feared I would get sick. Luckily I did not. The prime rib was super tough. The sushi had no trace of fish other than the Alaskan Pollock/ fake crab. They were so dry and bland. Some of the food was cooked well. This is a very average buffet. Nothing special here and I don't think they care to offer anything special. As for the Excalibur, I do love the hotel.",

    "text": "This place was horrible today on the Fourth of July I decided to take my family to the buffet at Excalibur. Because I'm a vet and they were having a military promotion I said why not. The brunch promotion stated that brunch would be from 7 AM to 3PM. the menu stated that there would be unlimited mimosa. When we got there the bar was still setting up. When I asked the bartender what time would he be open, he stated \"We aren't open yet. You'll know when we are open.\"  The bartender was very rude. His name was Erin. By now it was 7:20. I requested to talk to the manager.  The general manager came out named Alessandro P. He had horrible customer service too. He walked over and asked me what was wrong, I told him that we paid for a brunch with Mimosa's, I told him that his bartender was rude, and he then stated \"not again, I keep getting complaints about him\" he also stated that the bar does not open until 8. I asked him well why didn't the sign say that because I would've just showed up at that time then.  The way the manager was talking, it was as if he was like o well. So I asked if I could speak with his manager. He say I don't have a boss I am the boss, I told him that he was not helping me, he said \"well what is it that you want from me\" I stated that I wanted my money back because I didn't get what I paid for. Alessandro then stated \"NO\" that's there's nothing he can do for me.    My experience with this hotel buffet was horrible. I encourage people to stay away. Until they get another general manager because he should know better than to treat paying customers like that. I talked to fellow workers there at the buffet and they also stated that Alessandro was always mean and rude to the customers and staff. SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE. I uploaded a picture of the promotion sign. Justin Crowe and Steve Wilson were GREAT but it just did not take the bad experience and bad taste out of my mouth.",

The upgrade to beer and wine for $10 was a great call too...for this you get 2hrs worth of unlimited beer and wine. Fabulous!

    "text": "My family and I decided to go here for our last dinner in Vegas and we were intrigued by buffet renovation. The new interior design is fresh, modern, and way more appealing than the old buffet. They even ditched the old \"Round Table Buffet\" name for \"The Buffet at Excalibur.\" The inside is pretty nice and the layout is basically just a straight line of stations where you can get food from standard buffet cuisines including the Asian, Italian, Latin, a carvery (has various cuts of meats), salads, seafood, and there is even a bar! The desserts station is located near the entrance so you can't miss it.  The food selection was decent, but I was able to see everything within 2 rounds of getting food. The seafood selection is nice since there are shrimps, crawfish, and crab legs. One thing to note is that the shrimp is not fully peeled for you unlike in some other buffets. The seafood paella is also hard to eat because the shrimp still has the shell and head! Their sushi selection consists of California rolls with or without masago, vegetable rolls, and I think there was spicy tuna. The sushi was above average compared to other buffets.   High lights I found were the salmon, crab legs, and the made to order crepes from the dessert station. You can get nutella, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapples, and powdered sugar along with your crepe! The only downer is that the crepe is not as crispy as I would like it, but that's not a deal breaker for me. You can also get your crab legs steamed, but there is generally a line for that so just be warned.   There is a bar station located and you can get free champagne and mimosas along with your meal. All the other drinks will cost you additional money.   Overall, I'd say you guys should give this place a try if you like going to buffets. It isn't the best, but it also isn't the worse. And believe me, it is much better than what it used to be.",

They have a self pay kiosk were you can charge the meal to your room and I've never seen a line for those machines.  Some dishes were better than expected, like the pinto beans and my personal favorite, the fresh-made crepes with macerated strawberries powdered sugar and whip cream. I'd eat nothing but those and coffee if we go back.  Some other items were sub-par to be sure. The scrambled eggs for example were obviously powdered and reconstituted, poorly. The orange juice was very acidic, like hurt my mouth acidic.   There were lots of middle of the road options to meet all appetites. The country fried steak with biscuits and gravy  for example were well cooked, not tough and dry. The breakfast burritos were more like chimichangas, rolled at both ends and fried. They're small and crunchy with an acceptable flavor.  Basically, act like you should at any buffet: look with your eyes and judge how the food looks before impulse reaching for the spoon and you'll do fine.   If it were a bit cheaper this would rate a four star. There's just too many other good choices in Vegas at or below this price to give them more than three stars. If you've got an hour, walk over to Eggslut at the Cosmopolitan for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich instead.",

I do not get how they charge what they charge as this buffet is not comparible to similar priced buffets. The food resembled that of subpar cafeteria school lunches or something even worse. We were a party of ten and what a waste of money. I'm hungry still because there just wasn't anything worth eating. Everything I did try was gross.

There were only a handful of veggie options. I would havw appreciated beans in the latino section.  News flash excalibur buffet, good food is a lot more than just meat. I will have to commend the tasty cheese ravioli. The desert bar was amazing. They even had a sugar free section and some of the options including the carrot cake were better!",

    "text": "Was here end of January 2015, We had a couple hours to killl between check out & leaving for the airport & the buffet looked nice after the remodeling so we tried it. Got in about 3:30pm for lunch price & already they were switching over to dinner food, which initally was frustrating as there was almost nothing out on the actual line to choose from, but soon enough the dinner food was brought out, fortunately because one of the very few redeeming things about this buffet was the crab legs which are only put out for dinner. They are cold & snow crab and not peeled like other places, they are whole but with a useless cut in each to help you open them in a mysterious way. These crab legs were watery & not nearly as good as the one's at the bellagio buffet, but were good enough that I ate 2 plates full of them and not much else. My husband had to ask a random cook behind the line for the melted butter because it was not put out, like are they hiding it or what?   I actually love that the drinks are self serve, if i want orange pop once, then milk, then water I'd rather get it myself than be judged by my waiter person for being a beverage weirdo. I wish all buffets had a self serve drink station.. Anyway, the rest of the food was pretty terrible, the mashed potatoes were atrocious, a label I don't give easily to one of my favorite and hard to screw up foods, but seriously, I almost spit out the one tiny bite i took. ugh! my husband tried the roast beef from the carvery & said it was pretty bad, he got a crepe from the dessert station & loved that though. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts, but they did appear to have some sugar free pies & stuff if you're into that sort of thing. Overall, I will probably not go back unless Im planning on just loading up on crab legs and am unable to get to a better place for them. It was an ok way to kill some time and get a last minute crab fix before going home & that's about all.",

My first experience with this MGM phenomenon, I took gor granted that the food would taste as good as it looked. Was I wrong! I went down the line putting a little of 3 of the stations before returning to my seat and, to my utter amazement, I devoured everything on my plate from the ribs to the pizza to the fettuccine to the sausage. Needless to say, I couldn't, as good as it looked, sample everything in the dessert line. So, I took an ice cream cone to go. And, as I left, I thanked God that I had an all day pass! If you want GREAT food at a good price, this will well surpass your expectations.",

Service: Had a buy one get one free and it wasn't even worth $19 for two people- I can't imagine paying that for one person. 4 people in front of us and it took 2 cashiers 20 minutes to process them. When it was finally our turn, I had to tell the cashier twice that I wanted to use my BOGO coupon, and she still forgot to apply it. She says to me (rudely) \"I'm hard of hearing, EXCUSE ME that I don't understand you\". Well, then maybe you shouldn't be dealing with customers in a loud environment.   Food: No way this food was fresh. Everything was dried out- like it has been sitting under those heat lamps for 2 days. Food was tasteless. The only seasoning used is salt - LOTS of salt. Everything is chicken or pork. Cheap. No beef anywhere. At least not for lunch. Even the bread was stale.   The only positives: Self serve soda. Made to order crepes. But I can get self serve soda at McDonalds too.",

So what you have seafood and prime rib so does every other buffet in Vegas. The seafood was where? Some tiny tiny legs. And the prime rib... mmmkayyy. They didn't have much of a selection in any of their categories. Such a waste of money. Oh and they don't validate parking for locals.. I guess MGM doesn't validate anything!

So I'll say this buffet isn't busy and somewhat hidden so that's a plus. The hotel itself is kind of a dump unless you want to play carnival games, so unless you stay here I don't see why you'd pass through.  That being said the highlight of the breakfast buffet is the omelet station and crepe station. Everything else is middle of the road.   I mean you shouldn't expect much from this place, but based on price it's alright. If you're going to get overcharged in Vegas you might as well eat a lot right?",

The host was not personable and didn't really give customer service, she just moved people like cattle, and sat me at a big table and I never saw her again.  The food tasted old, nothing seemed fresh and flavor was lacking in pretty much everything.  Also, a huge killer for me, NO SALMON,  so I couldn't make a bagel and lox even if I tried.  Although its 20 bucks all you can eat, some might like that and find it appealing but. If the food isn't even remotely tasty, filling, or enjoyable. Save your money.  Do better Buffet, step your game up or keep getting low score reviews",

The asian food (I shouldn't expect much from it at the start) was bad, they didn't have crab rangoons but had a chicken taquito filled wontons. They served chicken tenders but no french fries, I was quite confused that they lacked the simplest items. Meatballs had no texture or taste. Cheese ravioli was God awful as the filling was looking a bit curdled. Dessert was bad, the german chocolate cake I had was stale.  Let's be honest, I know that buffets aren't known for their quality, but this was 24.99 I was paying. There was barely any selections that I could choose from. Even my college cafeteria has more selection than here!  The only saving grace was the roast beef at the carvery (and the tamales). That was delicious. I just wish the other items were just as delicious.",

The carving station only has a turkey and roast beef option. The meats are extremely over cooked, have no flavor at all and are horrible quality.  The \"Italian\" section is a joke and the only food in this section is cardboard like pizza.  The orange chicken is the absolute worst chicken I have ever placed in my mouth and is rock hard as well.  The Mac n cheese is neon yellow and leaves a unpleasant taste in your mouth for the rest of your meal.  All other options here are mediocre at best and deserts are not good. Ice cream has no flavor at all. For $25+ pick any other buffet on the strip. Do not eat here under any circumstances. Not if you're walking by, staying in the hotel or any other reason.",

If you do not have those two I would recommend you do because it provides you with a free Buffet ticket or a BOGO, buy one, get one free Buffet. In my case I received a BOGO dinner so I went in with my fiance. The cashier ladies are mediocre, they are not as nice as you'd expect them to be, they just take your payment and send you on your way. A host will bring you to your table where your server/ bused will greet you and give you straws, and napkins. Here you get your own drinks from an unlimited drinking fountain, there are an assortment of coffee, tea, and Pepsi brand product soda's.   The food line is just one straight away path, left to right they categorize the type of food they have: salads, seafood, Italian, carved meat station, Asian, Latin, and the bar station. Towards the entrance of the Buffet there's the dessert station where a crepe station is located followed by cakes, brownies, other dessert bakery items, and ice-cream machine. The food is okay and I really like the Asian and seafood station, the crepes are good but the guy working it is rude. He doesn't speak to you instead uses hand motions and when I would speak to him as to what toppings I wanted he would air me out or help the people behind me where he skips over me. I have been here five times and it happens all the time with the same guy. Crab legs are cut in half which makes things easier for you but it isn't steamed, it's in a bed of ice and the crab legs are not as meaty as you'd want or expect it to be. Butter for your crab legs is located at the carved meat station, just ask and the guy will give you a cup. Our server was nice but she only bused our finished plates so we barely seen her around.

The dessert selection was pretty good, but I disliked the carrot cake. A fairly boring selection to choose from.  You can pay by kiosk with a credit card, which was cool and a time saver. The price was also fairly good, which is what helped this buffet secure a 3 star rating (if it were just the food, I would have given it a 2 star.)  Worth a try if you're in the area and hungry, but nothing to go out of your way for. Good value for the money, but the selection is so-so. Maybe it's better for dinner.",

    "text": "There were so many issues I'm unsure where to start. First off... even with the buffet being complimentary    we would have much rather paid for a meal elsewhere. The food was mediocre and the staff was rude! From the check in clerk to the food staff just terrible service! As the patron in front of me was fixing her plate the food runner was removing the dishes. The patron hadn't even released the serving spoon into the dish before the worker was removing it from the serving Station. Myself and the lady asked for the eggs as we were both going for them. The worker threw the eggs back on the service station and said \"breakfast is over ladies I'm taking these they go in the garbage \" needless to say for this and other issues with this hotel I will NEVER stay at Excalibur or go to the buffet again",

Dinner: The sole reason we even went to dinner here was because it was comped for them not having our room ready on time. I still had to pay the $6 difference +tip. Thank god thats all I had to spend on this meal as it was pretty horrible all the way around. My husbands pizza looked inedible (and after a bite he discovered, it was in fact, inedible). The roast beef was dry and honestly nothing I had was great. I finally got to the crab legs and philly rolls which were at least decent and saved the meal for me. Also, the desserts are a win. But seriously, don't eat here for dinner. Anything in the food court would be cheaper/tastier.  Brunch: Now, here they get a bravo from me. It helps that I'm a breakfast person though. I could eat it for every meal. They really won here though with their Omelette bar,  crepe bar, their eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy. and the glorious glorious coffee. If you're going to spend the money on this buffet, do it for brunch only.",

At roughly $60 without drinks. Applebees or Chilis or Olive Garden would be a much better choice. As for the hotel the first room they gave us a stranger showed up with a key for the same room they put us in the wrong room after being given a second we found out the TV didn't work after being given a third room which was nice we found out there was a view of the roof instead of the strip view we had before. They gave us the buffet as a peace offering but the buffet was not worth giving. We bought five nights here prepaid to get a deal the deal ends up not being a deal after all but we're stuck here for four more nights we won't be back to Excalibur.",

Judy even specifically asked for them to bring out the sprinkles and brought them all the way to our table for my god daughters ice cream just to make her happy despite us even requesting them.   The food is just regular buffet food. Nothing amazing however their dessert bar has some good options. I wish we had come for dinner and not brunch but for the money probably won't eat there again. I'm not huge on buffets but it was easy. I wish they would have had pastas and what not but assuming they were lacking due to it being brunch.   The stars are for Sherry and Judy.",

I came with my 18mo daughter who has been sick the last day so she has been having plain rice , bananas and applesauce. You could tell she was getting burned out on the rice and apple sauce, being dinner time they didn't have any bananas out due to it being a breakfast item , the seater Sonia came over to ask how everything was going , I told he everything was fine and asked if they happened to have any bananas, let me just say at this time I had already asked the person by the fruit and they said it was only a breakfast item . She went out of her way to go I the back ( again she's a seater ) and ask , she came back and said they would look and see if they had any , she came back with not only one but two bananas and gave them to my daughter. This made her night. If every place had a person that went above a beyond for people they way she did it would make going places so much more joyful. Thank you Sonia",

    "text": "My husband's family who came in from Spain stayed at the Excalibur while we were all in town for our wedding last week and we decided to give their buffet a try the day of the wedding.   While we thought it was a little expensive for what it was, overall we were satisfied with the food and selections.  However, we will not be dining their again and will be voicing our distaste for the buffet based on the POOR SERVICE we encountered.  This was my husband's family's first trip to the United States and of course it took them a bit longer to get acquainted with the buffet process/sorting their American money, etc.  First of all, the woman at the cashier station seemed aggravated as they counted their money and seemed annoyed at any questions that were being asked through translation from my husband.  But the worst employee was an older Indian woman who was borderline rude and very condescending to his family as well as mine.  All she could do was yell 'How many?!' And when we explained that there were more in our party still arriving, and to please wait a moment as we wanted to have the right total.  She also was condescending to my husband's family and seemed annoyed that their English wasn't perfect.  She even went so far as to try and 'herd' us out of the way without explaining why as we were waiting for the rest of the family who was literally at the cashier station paying.  Very poor customer service.  As the manager at 5 star hotel here in LA, I felt perhaps the management could use our experience as a training tool to perhaps teach their staff the importance of EVERY customer EVERY time as you may have no idea who the people you are shuffling about may be and who they may influence.",

I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get into my poorly cooked crab legs because they only offer a fork. Again when asked about it they were rude. The crab meat did not come off of the shell well either, I had to dig it out of the shell and it did not taste good, the crab meat tasted old. The oysters tasted equally as old. I will never come back to this buffet ever again because of the poor customer service, the lack of a restroom, and the horrible food.

I only paid to be here for the crab legs and I feel cheated. Instead of not having the crab legs they have craw fish. I thought maybe that'll justify it, but they wouldn't even heat them up for me and the cold texture of the craw fish made me almost vomit. I never realized the crab made up for mediocre food that they serve here. I guess next time I come back to vegas I'll shell out few extra dollars to go to a buffet that actually has something decent. If I had to choose somethings to say that were good, I would say that the waiters are very nice and the crepes are pretty good.",

Lastly, I liked that there was a wide selection of desserts including cakes, pies, ice cream,  bread pudding (my favorite!), and even a made-to-order crepe station. Choose this buffet if you're on a budget and want decent food.",

Kids under 5 are free, which worked perfect for us because we have a 3 and 4-year-old! So hubby, me and our 2 kids ate for $18.99. Can't beat that! Buffet isn't too fancy, more like the quality of Hometown Buffet, but pretty big for the price. Dessert bar was awesome, and the drink station had many options. They also have all-you-can-drink alcohol for an additional $15 or $20, I think. Food and service were good, no complaints there. Don't think it's worth $18.99 per person, but as long as they offer the buy 1 get 1 reward, we'll keep coming back!",

There is a lot of competition in vegas especially with the older hotels since you have all the new ones dawning over you like city center. Most of the hotels these days are going through complete makeovers to keep up with what is hip and current. The old excalibur buffet was dark old and dingy and looked like it was built during mideval  times...and  let's just say the food wasn't that great either. But this place got a huge makeover brand new everything and the food choices are so much better. I used my myvegas comps to score a free lunch buffet and it was Soo good so many choices and the dessert counter is awesome and did I mention you can built your own crepes?  How cool is that. Excalibur great job on the makeover you will deff see my buisness again!",

    "text": "SHOCK AND AWE! Now one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas!  As part of Excalibur's new \"adult\" theme they completely remodeled and remastered The Buffet At Excalibur! Gone are any \"draw in the kids\" ideas and it worked.  The Buffet reopened late last December 2014. This was not a makeover. It was a rethink everything and make it the best value on the strip - competitive with likes of Bellagio.  Check in is a breeze! Customer-centric, they quickly check your players club card to see if you qualify for any comps or discounts! SCORE! My meal was $4.00!  What I LOVED:   - Bright, modern interior with bold but inviting jewel tone colors.  - Ample space  between tables and booths!  - Five diamond service. That is not an exaggeration. I was always being politely checked on and the staff is HAPPY and WELCOMING!  - TWO Self Service drink stations! No waiting for water. And a full service bar!  FOOD!  - By reducing the number of offerings by about 25% they focus on the expensive and delicious things!   - Food is HOT! No gimmicky crap like cold or lukewarm food in a mini-skillet!  - Everything I sampled was superb! The dim sum and pot stickers were served in authentic steamer baskets. The roast turkey wings were to die for. Especially with the portobello sauce with huge hunks of mushrooms.   - Omelettes made to order! Nothing like a sassy mushroom, spinach and bacon omelette!    - The Mexican station had a delicious nopales (cactus) and the most unforgettably scrumptious seafood enchilada I ever tried. Not only HOT but SPICY HOT! SO GOOD!    - No stale rolls here! Breads were abundant and the onion rolls were divine.   - A masterpiece of a desert station with fresh made crepes stuffed with every fresh fruit, berry or sauce you could imagine. REAL whipped cream. The flans were so good I had SIX! And the Molten chocolate cake SMORE cake had me licking my plate!     - Table service to clear the plates was unobtrusive and invisible. I scanned the entire place (and this was both visits) and never saw a dirty plate.   - Immaculate clean bathrooms located right outside the entrance.  HIGHLY recommended!",

Some of the things here were also a little cold. The food is nothing spectacular, really.. During dinner we had this tall older woman as our waitress, we did notice she was going around checking up on everyone else and picking up dirty plates, except our table. Pictures my husband took will be posted later..   My husband had to walk up to two women up in the front and complain. Finally she walked by and took our plates but gave us a nasty look. I am not one to keep quiet about anything but my child was having a good time so I left it alone.  Idk if it was a race thing or what, to be honest. All the white people's tables were getting their plates constantly picked up out of their way..   The next morning when went up again for breakfast. My son and I are not breakfast people so you can only think of what we thought about the breakfast here. The breakfast part of this review is based on my husband's thought only lol He really like the options he had to choose from, he stuffed his face that morning but I couldn't blame him because it had been his first real breakfast he had since our other hotels only offered the typical continental boring breakfast. Our server that morning was Sergio. He was amazing. Very good customer service with him. Really nice man.   Overall, nothing to brag about when it comes to food. I would not come back, I'd rather look around and eat elsewhere.",

    "text": "I really like the improvements that have been made to this buffet. It used to be nothing much more than a cafeteria. But, now they have good dishes and lots of selections. A good value. Live crepe station at the large desert bar.   I must talk about the Friday and Saturday crab legs. THEY ARE DOING A DANGEROUS PRACTICE, AND NEED TO STOP IT! First of all, they RUIN the fun part of eating crab legs. Like any crab afficianado will tell you, the \"prize\" is getting to that last largest piece at the end of the leg, getting it out unbroken, and we want it to easily slide out. None of that happens, and here's why. First of all, they over-cook the crab to the point of it sticking to the inner shell, making it frustratingly (sometime virtually impossible!) difficcult to get the meat out. Also, their practice of over-cutting the large section into the meat and into those skinny thin bones is DANGEROUS! They need to stop it! If they want to cut into that large piece to make it easier to crack, fine. But, they should only nick the outside of the shell, not cut into the meat! By doing so, they are leaving a half-length tiny thin bone inside the last section. This gets eaten by almost everybody who doesn't realize it's there! That's when you'll gag and cough to get it out, or choke on it until you throw up in public. PLEASE EXCALIBUR BUFFET - STOP CUTTING INTO THE MEAT AND INNER BONE ON YOUR \"COURTESY CUT\" ON THE CRAB LEGS! You will end up in court fighting a case brought upon by somebody choking on that bone which YOU dangerously create by over-cutting the legs.   100% self-serve, including drinks, means no servers. The only folks working there besides cashiers are the ones going around picking up your dishes. So, no tippping needed, since nobody is getting your refills or anything. Hint: go 1/2 hour before dinner, pay for lunch, then eat dinner. So, I cheat a little. I'm on a fixed income. So, I do what I can to save money.",

I was reading the sign in the front of the restaurant about the multi-meal pass when the manager called me over stating something to the effect of \"I can give you better information than the sign.\" I spoke with him and I honestly believe  I heard him say the meal pass was good for 24 hours.   When I brought back my receipt the next day (within 24 hours), I was told it was not good for 24 hours and only lasted for the day before.  I spoke with the manager who at first acted like I never spoke with him (even though it was less than 24 hours ago) and swore he never said it was good for 24 hours.    Be that as it may, I felt a little misled and felt he should have made that more clear when I spoke with him.  Had he let me simply read the sign as I was doing, I might not have had that misunderstanding.   His response was basically \"too bad\" and he refused to make any show of good faith on the misunderstanding.  Needless to say, I will not be dining her any time in the near future.",

There was a decent assortment of options that varied from southern food to Italian,  Mexican and Asian cuisine,  but the best part was their crepe station located in the desert section.  We payed in the mid 30's each for dinner,  but this came with unlimited beer and wine. We drank various varieties of wine and they all tasted a little light.  The best drink was created by my wife by mixing the sobe life water, with ice, and then adding chardonnay.   It was a light and refreshing drink. Overall,  there are better buffets out there.  This is not a buffet you visit to be wowed, but overall it hits the spot and can satisfy even the hungriest in the group.",

When I dine at a buffet, I always look at the food and it's presentation, most of all the cleaningness of the area's. It's always a safe way to eat at food that is made in front of you like a craving station. The Turkey and the Roast beef were both deliouses, most of stored properly and No cross- contamination with the employees utensils. A plus for this.  Employee hygiene was also up to par. Hair Nets and hats for all the employees who where working behind the line. The seafood area,the food was also stored properly on a bend of ice. The colder the better and most of all safe for us to eat. As the employee brought fresh and new food out they didn't mixed the old with the new. Great job for this.  Newly remodeled, relaxing atmosphere. Tables spread out with plenty of room to get around. Great Job to all the employees from the back of the house to the front of the house. Stay consist on Quality, Service and Cleaningness. 24/100 Yelp challenge.(2018)",

I can't say it tastes bad just didn't taste anything at all. Especially the desert which was surprising. I think the Golden Coral has better flavor and less expensive. ",

We only came here because the hotel comped us a free meal here and I still felt ripped off. I didn't even want to eat this food for free. The selection was very limited and the quality was just terrible. I got eggs benny and the English muffin was so hard I couldn't cut through it. For fruit choices they had some melon that looked like it had sat there all week, cut up oranges, and a canned fruit cocktail they dubbed 'tropical fruit mix'. The scrambled eggs tasted like plastic. I have had better continental breakfasts at motels.  The only positive I can say is they had a bubbly water machine and decent coffee. Oh and the ice cream machine was good! I mostly filled up on ice cream for breakfast cause it was one of the only edible options available.",

You might think that because this particular location is on the \"Budget\" category on many eat-lists that you may expect the experience to be less than. However I am here to tell you that is not the case. They have re-renovated the inside and the dessert Section rivals many other buffets. The real deal is when you get there during opening and get yourself an all-day-wristband.  You cannot go wrong with the wristband and it will also get you into the buffet at the Luxor. Also, the drinks package upgrade is always a great deal, it is still one of the most affordable places to have lots of champagne while you eat.  The most important thing to consider is which Crepe you want, see they make them fresh and delicious here, all are made to order and they have great ingredients , I like to go for the chocolate because hello I am in Vegas. The Service is Excellent  Pro Tip: Sunday Brunch is the Best at Excalibur especially if you are on a budget and don't want to break the bank.",

There were several large parties that had to be accommodated ahead of us. Yet, the restaurant is very large so there is plenty of seating. The price per person wasn't bad either and we appreciated that we didn't have to leave the hotel to eat.  PROS: Huge selection. Selection of meats are plentiful and quite tasty with carving section being the highlight. Eggs Benedict was very good and a surprise. Sushi, mostly California rolls, are fresh and flavorful. Mimosas are potent as is coffee. Fresh rolls and pastries are sweet. Large selection of soups. Crab salad available with a large selection of other salads.   CONS: Fresh fruit is not very fresh. Scrambled eggs are very \"cafeteria style\" and have to be seasoned to taste. No bathrooms in restaurant so you have to exit the restaurant and go around the corner.   Overall, you will find yourself with more than enough selections to fill more than one plate. Enjoy!",

Seriously though considering the price point it's pretty reasonable as far as a standard buffet goes. The food here is better than the Mirage buffet, but Mirage's highlight was that their buffet included beer and wine. For example, Excalibur's prime rib was a tad notch above Mirage. Their dessert selection is rather subpar, but they do have sugar free options.  Although Excalibur Buffet was on the smaller side it's still a decent buffet on the strip. Simple items. Not very 'wow' or unique. Seafood kinda smelled fishy, but I still ate it. I wasn't sick the next day so I guess it's alright.   Let me help you out: there are iphone apps called MyVegas, Popslots, and Konami Slots. All three of these are owned by MGM and is part of Mlife Rewards. For two people during the weekend excluding tip it's around sixty dollars. I paid 30ish. I like to play these games for fun and use the 2 for 1 buffet coupons(check the blackout dates). Most people also make the mistake tipping through card with a percentage but it's not necessary. Honestly, the servers like cold, hard cash :) Just because you got a coupon doesn't mean you should skimp on tip! Tip accordingly on the original price! Have fun!",

Food selection is pretty good from soups, pizza, meat carving (turkey, sausage, roast beef), pasta, and breakfast fresh cooked omelettes. Staff is very friendly and helpful if needed. They also have an alcohol happy hour that you can purchase a 1 hour pass which is decent for the limited mix drink menu but good for beers.",

If that doesn't convince you there's not enough variety and the food quality is bad. I only enjoyed the mashed potatoes. I got a slice of turkey from the carver and it was ridiculously pink, I don't know how their conscience allows them to serve pink turkey to other people freely when it could make you sick. it's terrible for a buffet on the strip and also expensive, the Luxor buffet is about the same price with much better customer service and better food quality. spend your time there instead.",

The deep fried shrimp were EXCELLENT. Everything else was good. The lady at the meat station on a day during the week seemed uninterested in helping others. Meat ran out and took over 20 minutes to replenish. Too long. The meat was also kind of tough and chewy. Other stations ran out of food (pasta especially and others) and no one was there to replenish, talk to, or order from. Great for something quick or for families. Need more staff to accommodate or check on items.",

    "text": "Decided to try the new buffet here as they recently re-opened, we love buffet, it was cheep-ish, and we were staying at the Luxor.   That was kinda a mistake. Wish we dropped more money on somewhere else.   While the staff is nice and the place does look quite sexy and new, the food was very \"meh.\" All of the stations lacked excitement and interesting good tasting options. Everything you would expect to be there was, but none of it was anything to brag about. It was all just okay.   Keep in mind by \"all\" i mean \"what was there\" because this buffet is SMALL. Smaller than any other vegas one I have been to. You can walk the line very quickly as you browse past all of the options at a breakneck speed.   There was a bar on the inside selling people more booze which I found to be weird. Also their beef was very weird as it was not only dry, but just unsavory. I really enjoyed the dumplings, but I had to serve myself and help rotate the dim-sum boxes because there was no one there to notice that all of the portions were missions. Also we had no idea that there was pizza until the end.   Really the most disappointing thing might have been the desserts. They were all out of soft serve and they said it would be a while to get it replaced, which sucked. The pre-made pastries and dishes were very unexciting, like the rest of the food, and to top it all off the dude burnt a crape.   It's a shame that this place is so new and could have had so much potential but is just so uninspired and the food is not worth the admission.",

The food has been to temperature, the wait staff attentive and the price reasonable. The variety of items is vast for each meal - especially lunch and dinner. It is a well organized place - you can pay for your meal different ways (kiosk or a cashier) and then you are quickly taken to a table. The longest wait to be seated for me was 2 minutes.   You can purchase an All Day pass for a low price which covers your meals - you get a wristband and simply walk in.   It is a very clean place - the wait staff removes used plates efficiently and I've never seen any food on the floor. Maybe there were issues in the past and if so it appears that they exist no longer.   The food was tasty with a carving station, custom made omelets, crepes and a wide selection of soft drinks/juices to choose from. There is a area to purchase alcoholic beverages from (though I never did)... I recommend trying The Buffet and I think most people will like it.",

Yep, MGM hotels are now charging for parking in Las Vegas. Wtf? I thought if I ate at the buffet that it would be validated. No.   You can choose to pay by cc by a machine rather than dealing with a cashier. You will still be seated by a human being and there is a server that will clear empty plates.   Food: so incredibly limited and basic. I can honestly say that a buffet in Reno is better (I just went two weeks ago). They will have a carving area with various meats, etc. There wasn't one during breakfast at The Excalibur. My 8 year old was underwhelmed (I came here for him).  Given all these idiosyncrasies...none of this translates into any type of value for the customer.   I give 2 stars because service was nice but food wise, I'll choose a different restaurant in Vegas. There are plenty of other choices.",

Desserts - lots of selection!  Over all, it was an OK buffet. We only paid $30 - would not pay full price for this buffet.   Staff was nice and kind. Our plates were always taken away.

Everything ranged from terrible to \"maybe ok if you're desperate\". We had $15 voucher from staying at the hotel and we paid about $46 for two for Friday night dinner. The lady who checked us in said it was good and that people come for the seafood. The seafood was abysmal. Everything was cold and we saw no crab at all (they had crawfish, oysters and shrimp). I basically tried everything and there was not a single item I can recommend, oh actually no, there was a crab/seafood soup that was actually pretty good. They did manage to screw up a freaking crepe though despite being made fresh by just dunking the toppings on, my girlfriend seeing this asked to only put a little and it was still too much. They just took a spoonful (the big spoon) and just threw it on. Overall, worst buffet I've ever been to and I don't give that title out lightly.",

For me, this wasn't bad because honestly, I got two free meals using MyVegas Rewards...  and although the food is by no means gourmet, it was filling, there were good options (including unlimited Mimosas during brunch!) and again...  it was free.    I was there during a weekend, so normal pricing I believe is around $24 a person for brunch and $29 a person for dinner.  I wouldn't be thrilled paying those prices for the amount of food I ate, but again, if you get it for free it's much easier to just say this is basic sustenance...  and move on.  And surprisingly, there were some good options.  For brunch, the omelet bar is the way to go - as it almost always is.  They have lots of different stations but stick to the basics...  a Mimosa or two, an omelet, some actually good bacon, and a passable biscuit.   The pastries are also not bad and there is a big selection.   My friendly server even gave me a coffee to go.    For dinner, I did some nicely rare roast beef, a decent ravioli and some passable mashed potatoes and gravy...  Again, plenty of selection but sticking to the basics will probably yield the best results.    The service both times was really good and very friendly.    True that I wouldn't necessarily PAY for this and be thrilled about it, but if you use your MyVegas rewards smartly or you get this comped, it's not going to be the worst dining experience.   And if you came for the gourmand experience, you probably aren't staying at Excalibur, right?    If you're feeling flush, there is a tip jar for the omelet chef...  OH VEGAS.",

I paid 97 cent out of pocket for the buffet. When I got in I found out mimosas were complimentary. That was a nice surprise. My coffee was great and staff was friendly. I sampled everything. Shrimp, crawfish which was cold. I heard you can ask them to heat it up. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The crepes bar was good not great, but the dessert station was vast. Honestly, the bottomless mimosas are the draw. I stayed at Excalibur and the restaurant was convenient, but when I come back I will definitely come back. Can't really say enough good things about this place.",

Crepes didn't have bananas or strawberries, only some cherry or blueberry puree to go inside.   The lady's taking the plates were friendly and quick.   I went to the Buffet inside Paris for brunch the following two days! Much better buffet that's about 22$ with a groupon.",

    "text": "WARNING: I do not recommend the buffet in the Excalibur. I'd recommend either spending more money on a buffet or spending less money at a Chuck-A-Rama. Either way you'll wind up eating better food.  There was no Prime Rib nor Crab legs like the photos advertise. You can tack on an extra $10 to your bill to add an old looking pound of crab legs to your buffet, but if you're going to spend $35 then I recommend you just fork over $50 for all u can eat freshly cooked crab legs at The bacchanal in Caesars Palace.  I'd also suggest anywhere else for cuts of meat. The meat portion of this buffet offered only two choices: chicken or roast beef. I'm afraid I get more tasty meat selections from a small town grocery store deli.  Their desert bar did have bags of buttered popcorn that were cold. Yep you read that correctly. They had sub par dollar theater snacks at their desert bar. The popcorn was as cold as the heart of the chef who designed this menu. I get that it's a budget buffet, but it's really terrible even for a budget place.  I will say the tables were clean, the area was well lit, and the soda fountain was just as good as anywhere.  Oh and there was some sandy muscles, spoiled shrimp, and soggy Crawfish. So there's that.  If you do find yourselves stuck here stick to the soda fountain and tasty stuffed ravioli. Any other dish will taste gross and leave you feeling ill. Literally 2 out of 3 of us got sick from eating here.",

    "text": "Las Vegas has quite a few notable buffets to choose from and although I'd love to try them all, sometimes you just have to settle for what's most convenient. Since we were staying at the Excalibur Hotel, we decided that it was most convenient to eat at The Buffet located on the second floor of their main floor. Unfortunately, our experience was just okay.   It was a Sunday night when we dined here and being that it was a weekend, they had crab legs available. The price for weekends also tends to be a bit more expensive than the usual nights.   Buffets usually sacrifice the quality of the food for the quantity and portions they dish out. Normally, I would be okay with that since you can grab seconds, thirds and fourths; essentially you can eat until your heart's content or may I say, your stomach's. But if the selection of foods to choose them are sparse, then there's really no point. I found myself from one end of the buffet to the other end with not a lot of interest from most of the selections of foods offered, but I made do. For my first plate, I had their Cath of the Day, fried shrimp, chow mein, steamed vegetables, an eggroll and a cheese knot.   As far as the selections went, their carving station had quite a few selections of meats to choose from, especially my favorite, Prime Rib.  That excitement quickly vanished when I took my first bite and found it to be tough and dry.   I'm not saying the food we had was terrible, but it definitely wasn't delicious either. And I don't want to seem like I'm complaining, but for the price we paid versus what we were offered, I couldn't help but to feel a little gypped. My mom is more patient and less critical than me. She seemed to enjoy her meal, and if she's happy then that's all that really matters, right?",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've been back to the Excalibur (one year to be exact) but let me tell you why I returned and decided to give Excalibur's buffet another go. Keep reading, this is a review you definitely want to know about, it will save you money and you will enjoy your food, I guarantee it!  One week ago the wife and I had a taste for crab legs and we decided to try the higher priced Wynn Buffet, what a mess and disappointment. The crab legs at the Wynn were so salty, there was no way I could power through and eat more than two small legs, I felt like I was on the Titanic drowning in salt water. So disappointing and we paid $114 for two dinners  Now fast forward to last nights dinner at the Excalibur buffet, i paid $66 and I finally got the crab legs I was seeking, were they big legs we've all grown to love 5 or 10 years ago, no, those days are gone due to depleting the ocean's resources, but they were good quality crab legs, NOT ONE was salty, actually they were sweet in nature.   As times change, so must we, I couldn't ravage a plate of crab legs the size of a full grown German Shepard's leg, more like a Chihuahuas' leg but the quality was what I was after. I just needed to bring my thinking more in line with a fine caviar, smaller quantity but greater quality. The crab legs were sweet, oh so sweet and that's what made the dinner so enjoyable and truly one of the best crab leg dinners in such a long time.   There are many other variables that are going on and happening at the Excalibur buffet that those visiting only once in awhile would never know. For instance, most of this staff have actually worked at this Excalibur buffet for more than 20 years, from the ladies at the cash register helping to check you in, many of the waitresses to the unbelievable, always happy and smiling man at the carving station, always willing to heat up your crab legs. Most of all, the glue that holds this staff together, the head chef who is constantly checking temps, wiping down the counter, talking to customers and making sure the food remains fresh, visually appealing and of the highest quality and standards.  I know it seems strange to get such an amazing meal at the Excalibur buffet, especially when it's thought of as more of a kid friendly casino, I too long ago thought this buffet must be about hotdogs, hamburgers and Mac & Cheese, boy was I wrong and this unfounded perception kept me away from the Excalibur for many years. Don't do as I did in the past, go enjoy the sweetest crab legs on the strip and be sure to say high to all the wonderful staff that have given two decades of their lives perfecting their jobs and making sure the food and quality remains at the highest standards for all of us to continue to enjoy.",

The cost was decent at $25 dollars, but the food was lit    Food consists of your usual bullshit, but this place is more well known for its dessert. They had apple pie, cookies, and weird ass cake-and let me tell you, it may have looked like Gordon Ramsey just took a fat deuce, but it tastes like heaven rolling by into the Persian Army via chariot horse, and by that I mean it was godly. Do yourself a favor and come here for a decent buffet. They got 5 stars because the place wasn't shit, they kept it clean, and there was some great food that didn't taste like spoiled trash from your local Smiths store.   The steak was on point (medium well), their Asian section has Genghis khan frying up some awesome shit, and their Italian section taste like it just came out of Italy's oven. Overall, don't listen to these negative reviews, don't let that be your deciding factor. This place is lit  (for a decent price).  The people that usually complain are the ones that may put one star for not getting a straw with their self served drink.   Thanks, will be coming here again.",

We decided on the breakfast brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. They had many different selections and variations of food.  The food was all cooked properly and looked very fresh. The buffet location was very clean and recently remodeled. Included in the brunch buffet are bottomless mimosas which was an extra plus!! Overall the food here was good and had lots of variety.",

Well, definitely worth it if you can drink the house alcohol and eat all the seafood.  I KO'd after 3 plates, (I'm allergic to shellfish and most alcohol so I can never get my money's worth no matter where I go) but watched my husband eat tons if crab legs, some kind of clam/mussel and shrimp.   I LOVED the fact that their guacamole had very little to no cilantro and ate that with some good Mexican rice.  Chinese part was just okay but they do have some great meat cut and the chicken fettuccine Alfredo was really good. The noodle was not well done and the sauce was flavorful.   Service was actually good and friendly vs the reviews. They walked around enough to keep the tables de-cluttered but not to the point where they were constantly. It's nice that we can keep to ourselves and we're not forced to have empty conversations constantly throughout our meal.  I liked the fact that drinks are self-service so you don't have to wait for refills! :D.",

    "text": "Ok y'all. Im Asian and I can eat anything. Literally anything. And I rarely complain about food. Knowing that... it's about to go down.   I'm staying at the Excalibur for a convention. It's 8:30pm and the place is dead and I'm starving from getting lost in Vegas. I thought this would be a great place to fill my belly. $27. I fill my own drinks, get my own food and talk to myself cause the \"server\" can't say \"you're welcome\" anytime I say thanks. Lots of singles here including myself.   Ok... it's Tuesday night. I don't expect them to roll out the big food but they got shrimp. And I was excited. But the cocktail sauce is empty and they haven't refilled it. The shrimp is low and they won't refill it. I left like 3 pieces. The roasted chicken is dry. The salmon is dry. Basically they overlooked the amount needed and let it sit to dry status. I'm not aware if I'm allowed to ask for fresh food as I don't want to mess the buffet rules. As I walk down to see what looks tempting there are so many items that have glazed over from not being rotated. The gravy has a film on it... not that sexy film either.   The cups you get your drinks with are nursing home  cups. Where you can't actually tell if they are clean or dirty or what's in there. It's quite smart really. I don't know man... this was my bad for coming in when I saw no peeps at all.   So best thing about this place? Desserts... cause... desserts. You can't mess that shit up. So I'm going all carbs to get my monies worth.   If you are thinking of coming here... stop... splurge at the Italian place next door. Even just each a burger at Dairy Queen. Just don't. $25 on a Tuesday and I'm leaving hungry. At a buffet!!!!! Ahhhhhh.",

I come to Vegas pretty often and currently have a Gold players card, so I can skip the buffet lines, although I've only had to once because of the lack of crowd. I haven't had dinner here recently, as I usually save my stomach for the \"good stuff\" in Vegas during dinner time. My last several trips to The Buffet at Excalibur have only been breakfast on the weekdays, or brunch on the weekends. Let me just say, this place has greatly improved from 10 years ago (when I just turned 21). They have renovated the place, made it brighter, added a bit more variety to the menu and now have a egg/omelet station as well as a crepe station. If you're here for breakfast/brunch, make sure to at least get the omelet and a crepe. Nothing else really matters here. I am pretty disappointed that they do not serve prime rib at breakfast or brunch, otherwise they would deserve at least a 3.5/4 star rating. Although I haven't had to pay out of pocket for a while, the regular breakfast price is pretty reasonable compared to other buffets in the area. I haven't been to every single buffet on the strip, but my order goes something like the following based on taste/price/variety: 1) Rio Seafood buffet (I think they just combined the 2 buffets now, but have 2 different price options, not MGM) Unlimited New Zealand lobster tail at dinner. 2) Wicked Spoon (Cosmo, not MGM) 3) Bellagio 4) Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace, not MGM) 5) Le Village (Paris, not MGM) 6) Aria 7) The Mirage 8) Planet Hollywood (Not MGM) 9) Mandalay Bay 10) Harrah's 11) The Excalibur 12) MGM (From here on down, it's not worth your money to go) 13) Luxor  14) Monte Carlo (The only place I didn't feel full when I left)  I've also been to the buffet at \"M\", but you would need to drive to get there or take a cab/uber. That one is ranked up there with Bellagio. I'm just going to list that in all of my reviews for each buffet.",

    "text": "I'd experience better food options in their food court rather than the buffet. Sorry it was said, but needed to. For every food item I kind of liked there was another item I hated. Everything wasn't fresh and you can tell by eating them. For instance the dough to make the crepe was good , but used fruit that may of been in a can for filling. Oh no, especially I've tasted what fresh crepes are supposed to taste like so that ruined my meal.   The service from the small bar was great. The lady there was engaging and informed me of what choices I would like (either the unlimited beer/wine option and what type of wine), and conversed with my soon to be married cousin and myself. So overall experience wouldn't have me come back when I'm in Vegas again. I will walk the extra miles for more food options for a better price.",

They have very cool \"pre-pay\" kiosks located to the left of the entrance, which allows to pay ahead of time and go straight to the hostess line, very nice for those busy days.  The food is excellent for the price you're paying, you have a very good variety to choose from, and they have an all day crepe station, which is nice too!  You have to consider the price you're paying for what you're getting in return and the food selection and quality is in line if not better than what you're paying for.    I highly recommend the \"all-day\" pass, it's a great value! Plus it comes with a wrist band that grants you priority seating, which is an excellent perk.  The all-day pass is a great value, especially when you want that extra money in your pocket to gamble with.  Another nice amenity about the buffet is that the drink stations are \"all about you,\" as well, they are completely self serve so you don't have to wait for a waiter or waitress to bring you your drinks, that's terrific.  Yes, there are better buffets in Vegas, but again, you get what you pay for and if you want an excellent selection for your money, this is the buffet to choose.",

My only downside was that they don't do senior portions as I had surgery and can only eat about 10 bites of the entire food choices. Was sad about paying so much for the little I had to eat. We had a party of 5 but 2 of us ate less than a 5 yr old would eat. The rest of the group loved tge amy of choices they had. Desserts were great. They had someobe making crepes to order. Loved that.",

Came back and got another crepe for lunch and some desert that our kid liked.  Was pleasantly surprised with Luxor buffet at dinner after reading all the bad reviews, but it was fine with some decent seafood and good, if inauthentic, sweet Korean short ribs.   Might be a tad overpriced on its own, but if you want to eat a lot throughout the day and you're not a food snob, I'd recommend the Excalibur/Luxor buffet combo.",

Most casinos have a chip shot breakfast buffet (it's hard to mess that up) and a fancy dinner buffet (they save the good stuff for night-time), but the lunch buffet is, more a less, a throwaway (the hotel guests are out on the town).  For 20 DOLLARS(!),  I expected more than a bland buffet.... no taco shells at the Mexican station, no gourmet meat dishes, too many sausage dishes, etc. One of those buffets where you have to search around looking for something you really want on your plate - they just didn't have much.  Good points: I like that I have to get my own drinks, a large dessert carousel, spacious dining room. Still, waaay waaay over-priced. The food was good (except for some weird-smelling beer-battered fish), but this was not much more than the average $9.99 buffet.",

We arrived at 8:30 am for what we thought was a Saturday brunch offering champs, nope. Price is $21.95 but on Monday - Friday is $18.95...same food so why the increase? I can go to the Fiesta in Henderson with champs and better food for $8.99 Sat/Sun but we wanted to try something we thought was going to be an upgrade....lol what a joke.   Food: everything I tried looked and tasted like food was leftover from the day before and reheated.   Shrimps were all water logged, the crab legs had a brownish color to them with an odd taste.   Pastries none..all offerings were donuts. They did have a fresh crepe bar, but then again looked very dry. I didn't want to stand on line for crepe paper.   Overall I'm rating this one star because I have no choice.",

    "text": "I had not been to this spot before the refurbishment, but it is just OK. We were curious about it as the myVegas game advertised about the re-opening relentlessly. We typically go to the more popular buffet locations at Wynn, Caesar's, Cosmopolitan, and Bellagio, so this was an interesting experience.   We were very surprised with the wait... considering there were probably only 4 or 5 parties in front of us. The queuing didn't seem to work well. It seemed like we were all pushed to use the kiosks but then were stuck in that queue waiting to be seated. There were actually no one in line for the queue to pay with the cashier. We wished we went through the cashier instead so that we could have been seated quicker. They eventually noticed the inefficiency and allowed people to move in the cashier line so that everyone would through and seated quicker. That then caused a back up in the cashier line for people who wanted to pay... it was almost entertaining if it wasn't frustrating. Maybe the whole system would run better if it had been busier and both lines were filled and it didn't feel like there was a \"better\" option available to line hop to...   Things that I thought were notable: there was a self served beverage island that had a special water dispenser... 3 types flavored water as well as this ultra filtered water that tasted really good. Although there was a made-to-order pasta option... there was this pasta with shrimp on the buffet line that was soo good. Probably the best thing that I had there. The decor was modern and the location seemed pretty clean.  Desserts were just OK. They had a made-to-order crepe station that I was excited about, but when I asked for Nutella (they showcased 2 huge buckets of Nutella on display), it was watered down and runny so that they could just squeeze it out of a plastic bottle. I didn't think you could ever ruin Nutella, but this buffet had found a way. Also, my husband was really looking forward to the hand-dipped ice cream station... we couldn't even find it so we had asked someone to show us. It ended up \"not working\" this evening and that was why we had passed by it multiple times. The hand-dipped ice cream bars were just small bowls of melted ice cream with a stick in the bowl. Maybe there was no attendant to work this station? I'm not sure, but my husband was disappointed.  When I visit Vegas, I do look forward (and am willing to pay) for top-notch dining experiences, so I will probably not return to this buffet. With that being said, I believe this is an affordable option for a buffet experience. I had trouble rating this between 2 or 3 stars, but went with 3 as I believe this buffet is priced to its quality when compared to other buffets on the strip.",

    "text": "What does one pick for their 300th review on Yelp?  Do I make it a special occasion and choose a truly fantastic restaurant to heap welcome praise all over?  Or do I choose something so disappointing and vile that it crossed the boundaries of both exceedingly low expectations and all semblance of good taste?  Oh, I'm going for the latter.  Jesus, was the place bad.  I used to come to Las Vegas often with my mother and her parents, back in the day, staying at many a hotel and eating at many a restaurant.  Sadly, my grandparents are no longer with us; and, no, the Buffet at Excalibur didn't kill them, but I can guarantee you that any man who is not in God's good graces has this dump waiting for them on the other side of Purgatory.  Alright, I should probably start with all that is positive...  With that out of the way, now on to the mediocre.  The price isn't too bad.  Considering the cost of other buffets on the strip, it could be much higher.  On the flip side of that, the quality of all of the food here is so substandard that I'm not sure where the money is going.  Surely, at $20 a person, you can find some fare that's a step or two above Golden Corral.  And yet, all there is are forkfuls, glasses, and cuts of utterly disgusting garbage.  Which leads me to the resoundingly negative.  When you start browsing the stations, everything looks like it's been given a glossy sheen, a spray coating to seal in appearance like you would before doing a photo shoot for an overhead menu at McDonalds.  But, they never bothered to make the food look it's best before freeze framing it for posterity.  Using tongs and serving spoons to break that plastic veneer, you heap crap onto your plate to bring back to the table before you start pushing it around into separate, unappetizing piles before finally pushing your plate away with a disgusted and disappointing sigh.  The Beer Battered Fish is processed, every piece the same size and shape, all fried and left greasy in the tub.  The Orange Chicken is an abomination, again processed and freeze packed into chunks of mashed up meat that is almost entirely unlike chicken and coasted with some sort of thin, stickiness that apparently is orange flavored because a few slices of dried up fruit are stuck on top of it.  Macaroni and Cheese has a fake coloring to it, making it offensively bright yellow; which, by the way, also perfectly describes the taste.  The Fried Rice, while having some nice variety to the meat and vegetables in it, was still coarse and chewy, like someone didn't properly cook the rice first before frying it up.  French Fires are out of a bag, frozen and stale.  The Grilled Cheese was cut into hardened planks that were inedible.  The Tomato Soup that went with it was salty beyond belief, akin to sucking down a spoonful of alum.  The Chow Mein was alright, not good to the point of being at the average mark, but much better in comparison to everything else.  The same goes for the Carnitas, the right amount of salt and nothing unnecessary added.  Not great, but not horrible.  The beef in the Beef and Broccoli was like the kind of meat you get on a steak-um sandwich, thin and mealy.  It tastes mashed up and processed, like all other meat before it, and fell apart in the mouth in a very unappealing way.  The Chorizo Sausage was dry, a terrible taste, and only a requisite amount of heat.  And those desserts, the Red Velvet Loaf was dry, the outer edges dried into a crust that you couldn't even really cut easily with a fork.  The cookies share the same level of stale.  And all of the sugar free treats are easily a step or two below what you find at other, similar buffets.  Only the Bread Pudding was a saving grace to our lunch.  Not too bad.  So, in the end, I wish I had purged after this binging.  We all walked away grossed out, disappointed, and saddened by our experience.  Only the fact that we got a two for one deal from a casino promotion brought a light ray of sun to this debacle.  As it stands right now, the Buffet at the Excalibur has soured my time here at the casino, tarnishing the fonder memories I have of this end of the Vegas strip.  Thankfully, the Tournament was still just as good, making me not hate Excalibur completely.  But, I sure as hell will never come back here ever again.",

    "text": "I don't understand the low reviews for this one. It's a buffet, don't expect 5 star gourmet food here. With the that said, we came here during weekend brunch. The line was rather long but we have Gold Mlife status so we hopped in the VIP line and were seated in less than five minutes. Also, be sure to look for BOGO offers, we got ours from MyVegas online games.   The brunch was $21.99 I believe and a great quality for that money. It's been ten years since I last ate at the Excalibur buffet and its good to see they recently remodeled. The food was good, all the basic breakfast foods, bacon, eggs, sausage, etc. plus they had lunch items out as well including Asian, Mexican, salads, etc.   Based on this visit I will definitely return here on future visits considering the short line and cheaper price compared to other MGM properties.",

    "text": "The Buffet at Excalibur was remodeled and opened for business in December, if I recall correctly. The renovation is great. Modern, comfortable, nice layout etc.  However, the renovation just wasn't enough to rate it anything beyond 3 stars. I have been to at least 10 other buffets in Vegas and the food variety and quality here is rated around the bottom 2 worse buffets.  Some of the staple buffet foods were either completely missing (ie. crab legs) or just tasted terrible (orange chicken).Overall, the food was nothing to brag about. They need more 'blow your mind' types of food here. Everything is so standard. I've also provided them feedback on the survey they emailed me after my stay was complete.  The staff here is great. Very helpful, friendly and quickly refilled our drinks and cleaned up the dishes, but this just isn't enough to earn a higher rating nor my future business.",

Otherwise they charge 12.00 always and Casinos off the strip are FREE parking, and they charge more too. And the chefs are taught at the same schools! , Locals don't go to strip casinos tourists pay double and triple for the same food. I  give it a 1 only cuz that's the lowest.",

    "text": "Our first time at this Buffet.  Since they just remodeled, I expected a little more.  Instead, I found a very basic buffet.    We went right when lunch started so the Italian station still had breakfast.  This is a plus and a minus.  If you were hoping for brunch, you loved it.  If you were looking for Italian, you were disappointed.    What was left of breakfast was the basics.  Eggs, Hashbrowns, Sausage, Bacon, Waffles, French Toast, etc.  The Orange Chicken was slobbered with so much of what tasted like fast food orange sauce, you could barely taste the chicken.  On the other hand, the fried chicken was delish.   The made to order crepes is a nice touch.  The desserts were pretty standard fair for a buffet.    If you are a gold card mLife holder or greater, they do have a VIP line, the sign is just at the FRONT of the line.  Kind of confusing.  They also have self service kiosks - which means only 1 or 2 people the cash register.    And don't expect much help once inside.  It's all pretty self service except for someone who comes and cleans the tables.    If you're hungry though, stop by.  It's fairly inexpensive compared to other buffet's so if you're in the area, go for it!",

If so, come on in to the Buffet at Excalibur. Imagine if you will, purchasing everything on the frozen foods isle at your nearest dollar tree, and then heating it all up and eating it for only 20 dollars. That is exactly what youll get here. As an added bonus youll get subpar customer service from the bartenders, and your empty cups will stack to the cieling as they pile at the edge of your table. And if youre as lucky as I was, youll get a small insect in your shot of baileys Irish cream! So what are you waiting for!?!?! Come on down!",

But damn they were amazing.  Sweet, firm and easy out of the shell.  Now I am going to be honest here I ate about 5 plates of these tasty beasts so I didn't eat much else.  LOL The roast beef.  Amazingly rare and fork tender.  Very tasty.   There were other things that were good, but damn that crab was simply amazing.   I probably won't eat crab that good for the rest of my life. You can get your own drinks and the whole place was clean.  Staff was very attentive and I got seated immediately.   Because we all hate those places like Aria that will keep you waiting even though there are 100s of tables empty and no line.  Excalibur doesn't do that bullshit.   Deserts were very good too.

The salad bar did not have a lot of salad toppings like seeds and olives, no proteins like egg, bacon and ham. I lost my appetite. I did save room for dessert though. This buffet does have a really nice dessert bar with various homemade pastries and real icecream. Yet, it wasnt enough for me to ever want to come back.",

My friends and I used a 2 for 1 voucher from MyVegas (a Facebook game) for the weekend bunch buffet so instead of paying $22 each, we only had to pay $11 each. This made the buffet very worth it!   It isn't as fancy or varietal as the more expensive Vegas buffets, but it definitely did its job. The food was decent and the service was super friendly! We also loved the instant lattes that they had at the drink station. Oh, and the made to order crepes were a great touch! The only negative I'd note is that some of the Asian food wasn't that good. Namely, the shumai (dim sum item) and chow mein. However, I never expect the Asian food to be that great at buffets.   Definitely a solid cheaper buffet option in Vegas.",

I think people come here to try it out, as it was just renovated. It is similar to the buffet at the Luxor. At $26, early Aug. 2015, it was rather expensive for the unremarkable offerings. As in: paella - wow, that was a joke. First the ladle was blazing hot to handle; next you have mussels that are unopened, meaning not fresh; then they have tiny, tiny brine to what, add flavor? Hardly saw a squid, medium sized shrimp, or clam...a useless paella.  The spaghetti is OK but soupy. The veal portions are ground veal, breaded. I did not even try the Chinese selection. I go to Vegas to eat and taste things I normally would not find in Los Angeles, Orange County, or the San Fran bay area. This buffet is a little below par because it should be grand! It is after all newly renovated. Their best offerings were the roast beef from the \"steamboat of beef\" (that's a new one, I have to look it up), and the made-to-order crepes, The dessert bar was not too bad. But overall, to me it did not offer the variety, value, and taste I believe are Vegas hallmarks. Maybe I'll try it again in a year or so.",

You can also add unlimited beer or wine for $10 more.  The selections are pretty basic,  nothing fancy.  You have your standard salad bar, pizza and pasta, taco makings, Chinese food, carved meats and some seafood.  They also have a dessert area with lots of yummy treats.  For the price I think it's a great buffet and would return again.   The one thing I miss from their old buffet menu was mini corn dogs. THOSE WERE THE BEST!  Please bring those back!",

I thought the selection was great. Again though, vegetarian here, so maybe meat eaters expect more? I get excited if there's more than salad. The omelet station was great. The French Toast was tasty. And when I was done with breakfast their asian section had some yummy options.  The best part was the friendliness of the staff though.

They do, however, have a nicer dessert selection, which gave them the 3rd star. Overall, I was disappointed that I paid the same price for a better buffet just 2 days earlier.

    "text": "What a disapointment our lunch buffet at Excalibur was today. We were celebrating my birthday, so instead of our usual locals' casino buffet, we decided to splurge and go to Excalibur on the Strip. Big mistake! We'd been a couple of times in the last year or two, since they upgraded their buffet, and it was pretty good then-- better the first time than the second. This time was not great at all. The salads were really bland, the carving station had turkey, ham, and sausage (not salmon, which I could have sworn the website said they served). It was the most uninspired buffet menu I've seen in quite some time. There was nothing special to even talk about, except for the excellent cream of mushroom soup. The fish and chips were OK too. I even questioned if that \"free\" glass of wine even had alcohol in it! For $20 each, I think there should be more than just soup to talk about. I could barely even find enough to make a meal, and I am not a picky person. A $20 lunch buffet should be offering some sort of beef or fish at the carving station. They should have Mexican food that isn't dried out. They should have some inventive salads, not just cherry tomatoes with tasteless oily dressing on them. The dessert section was spectacular the last time we were there, but I only found one decent looking thing to take (a Napoleon, which was really good). But no chocolate ice cream-- only vanilla and pumpkin. Come on! I remember marshmallows dipped in chocolate and inventive things like that before. We had to get our own drinks, which is kind of a pain. Honestly, we would have had a better meal at any Station Casino-- Green Valley, Sunset, or even Fiesta Henderson (where it only costs $7.99!). No wonder this buffet isn't so crowded anymore-- word must have gotten out about it. They are just cheaping out, and are showing nothing creative anymore. Such a complete disappointment. We will not be back.",

The only upside was the crab legs however i came for the meat, it had to have been done this morning. It was dry and disgusting. The rest of the food was quite a bit below the standards of say... hometown buffet or golden coral.  I am still currently in the restaurant while the rest the family waits in the half hour line for the crepes. Will never be back!!!",

No flavor their breakfast items are gone at 10 am and they only have one item of each thing making the lines really big. Buy the time you are out of line your food is cold. Glad we didn't buy the all day . They did have good coffee and orange juice that's about it",

He was very sarcastic and rude with me in front of my husband. I inmediately brought this to the attention of the manager, the other employees were very kind and sympathetic and apologized. Sergio the old dude, needs to quit his job if he does not know how to treat a customer. He should quit and live on his social security. They should hire younger staff.",

I served tortilla soup, it was terrible.  The soup was mushy and very dissatifying. The salad was great,  but you can't really mess up a salad.  Everything else on the line was way too salty for my palate. Desserts were okay.  Just about everything is prepackaged. Made to order crepes were good.  In the evening we thoroughly enjoyed the peal and easy shrimp.  Like earlier, food felt salt, but buffets usually do higher sodium, prepackaged foods.  Carving station was overall good.   It really felt like we are eating cafeteria food.  The price is more affordable than most Vegas buffets but next time we will spend the extra $10 for a better selection.  Selection was weak.",

    "text": "Omg so I have to start by saying that this was by far a better dining experience than I anticipated! I got a pass for two free breakfast buffets here due to my lack of great customer service with the Excalibur hotels service! I decided hey why not it's free so of course I accepted and was willing to try them out! For starters if you are a platinum or I think Noir Mlife member you get to skip the line which is awesome within it self! Already off to a great start! Good selection was what I was most worried about based on previous reviews from my fellow Yelpers! Gladly every dish I had was seasoned properly and tasted excellent! Omelette station was a tad slow however this man is running 6 different skillets at once so he's the real MVP of the show here! Bartender was amazing as well with making my mimosas! I will definitely return! Oh yeah and you have to try out the Crepes station located in the desert section! They are made to order and extremely tasty :-)",
