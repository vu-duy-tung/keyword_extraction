It was not so busy and it's good for celebrating birthday or occasion. I haven't tried any other food but the snapper and steak and so far it is delicious. Ask the waiter to take few photos of you or group and they will gladly do it. Definitely a place to go back to.",

Their options for meatless meals are very limited and the ones they do have are fried. They happy hour per their sign is from 3pm to close which is great and their menu for is ok. They have two house wines (Cabernet  and Chardonnay) which were decent. The food option for happy hour were a disappointment so we chose to only have drinks and move on to the next place. The environment is really clean and modern however it's quite warm inside. Everyone once in a while someone would walk by and cause a breeze thankfully.",

This time there were some unidentifiable plants mixed in with the arugula salad.  One in our party sent the Chinese chicken salad back -- it was more of a spicy slaw with a chicken garnish than the entree salad with a protein serving we had on our first visit. The waiter was gracious with the substitute, but it throws off the timing of a meal to wait for a replacement.",

The bar was occupied by 3 other guests but the remaining spots were dirty - dishes and place mats from previous occupants.   I took one of these spots and the bartender (working furiously) assured me he would clean it shortly.  I left 90 minutes later and all 3 additional bar diners got the same experience.  They sat at dirty seats and waited quite a while for service.  Where was the manager???   Once I got to order, the food came quickly and it was delicious.  But my experience (leisurely lunch) was punctuated by a bartender constantly on the run, waiting on everyone in the restaurant and working furiously to keep up.  Getting his attention was difficult because he was so busy, but he was also extremely polite once caught.   Whomever manages this location was content to let him flounder for an hour and a half this afternoon while patrons paid the price.  Not a great experience, especially specially at a chain that prides itself on delivering an exceptional customer experience.",

I flagged down our server and asked if she could please get me a towel so I could wipe up the mess. She said OK, but never came back. I had to flag down the manager again and ask for a new napkin because I used mine to wipe up the mess. Food was good but expensive. 2 apps, 1 glass of wine and one entree was $69.00.  This is the 2nd time we came here  and the last time we left after 10 minutes because no one came to take our order.  This is probably the last time we come here.  Too many other choices.",

One of the many reasons the wife and I would make any excuse to come here. Well, guess we'll just have to come and catch it if we're here at the right time.  Update: Near the end of our visit, we were awaiting for our server to come check on is again. I wanted a refill on my ice tea and the wife was looking forward to another sangria. Well, needless to say we didn't see our server again until another 30 minutes (or so) and by that time, we were just ready to leave. We flagged down the hostess and voiced our concern and then a few minutes later a manager came and spoke with us. We were going to just brush it off but since we've been coming here I figured they should be offered the opportunity to know and be able to fix it. Again, food is good and the service is always great but that evening our server just gave us the impression that they wanted nothing to do with us. I hope their management gets it together and soon.",

We shared the homemade chips with blue cheese dip on visit numerous uno. They weren't great, the \"dip\" was more like old mayo in a bowl with a sprinkle of blue cheese.  This visit was worse, I ordered the chopped vegetable salad with chicken. In my opinion 22.00 for a small salad with carrots, celery and a few tomatoes is absurd.  The chicken didn't actually come on my salad, I had to ask for it showed up  third of the way into brunch.  My boyfriend ordered the wolf \"Mac\" muffin. Greasy, gross and child size. Also, comes with no sides so after adding avocado he paid 16.00 for a sandwich that he could have gotten at McDonald's for a dollar.  Service was not great, our waiter disappeared and we basically were shuffled through the rest of the servers. When our server shows back up he refilled my mimosa and hanged me a soaking wet glass with a \"sorry\" about spilling juice and bubbles all over it. This is a non issue, people spill things but at 80.00 for brunch the service should be close to impeccable.",

The truffle potato chips are a delicious app! I know! I typically don't order chips for an app, but the waitress recommended them...so we obliged. She was spot on with the recommendation! They were hot and crispy with a delicious truffle/cheese sauce on top! We all sat around and talked while picking at them! Our second app was the Tuna Tartare and it was equally as delicious! Obviously they are at completely opposite ends of the spectrum, but it was very good in its own right!   The service was a little snooty at first, but she really warmed up after we ordered our apps. By the end of our meal I really enjoyed her service!   The decor is industrial/shabby chic and I loved everything about it! The green glasses were amazing!

They had a roast beef sandwich that was so tender and perfectly seasoned that I'm extremely surprised it was cancelled.   I've been here several times and always 5 stars!",

My Girlfriend who is in remission from Cancer and this was her first outing, she decided she wanted to try this place out. When we arrived we were greeted by the \"hostess\" and I use that term very loosely because a hostess is the first one to make the experience great. She sat us down near the kitchen, now please keep in mind my friend is very sensitive to smells unfortunately , and the smell was an over powering fish smell that was coming from the kitchen. So we asked if we can move (and pointed to another table that was vacant) to another table, she said no. Then we asked again if its possible to be moved to any other table that wasn't near the kitchen , and when I tell you there were many open tables, she stated again \"no\" and not in a kind way of any manner.  Unfortunately we never were able to try the food because the \"customer service\" that wasn't  available, when we walked she clearly saw us and smirked and giggled under her breath. I would never go back just because of the rudeness of staff, and would recommended several of the other restaurants in downtown Summerlin.",

The waiter came by various tables and offered artisan bread, along with olive oil for dipping, as bread was not placed on the tables.  After taking one piece, the waiter asked us if we liked the bread and proceeded to state, if we did, then we could purchase it and pointed to the area where they were selling the bread.  For a restaurant of this size and the name-Wolfgang Puck, I would expect to have a small portion placed at each table.  There are far better places to dine in Las Vegas, and Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill won't be one of them for me.",

Everything we had, (enjoyed Restaurant Week Menu) including the brick chicken, pizza with mozz-and red sauce, tortilla soup, and a salted caramel sugar cookie dessert was so tasty and flavorful.  Service did drop the ball. We were seated and were approached by a waiter who introduced himself and said he would be back shortly. 7 minutes later another server came over and without any explanation took over. She was wonderful throughout and was very helpful. The runners is where the service gaffs occurred. We did not get new silverware between courses and the worst gaff came when the runner delivered the desserts during the MIDDLE of our enjoying our main course. He didn't offer to clear, just dropped the dishes and again no silverware was replenished. The waitress saw it after the fact and apologized but didn't take the desserts back, just left them there.  We Definitely felt rushed. The restaurant wasn't full.",

Here's what we had Mushroom pasta with marscapone- the pasta is VERY al dente- all of it! Very little flavor from this dish.. I didn't even eat half of it. Burger with a marmalade of some kind (only one on the menu)- it was just ok. Burger was cooked perfectly, veggies were fresh and bun was soft but it just wasn't great.  Mac n cheese- like I said previously, very al dente... Almost crunchy and the cheese sauce was very thin. Topped with bread crumbs though, so that was nice. Kids cheese pizza- best meal of the table. Crust has a really great sourdough taste and is nice and crispy.   Service was very personal and very attentive. My server let me try 3 wines before choosing the one I wanted. She also took my uneaten mushroom pasta off of my bill without me asking, which is always nice.",

Being a Wolfgang location and also in Vegas you're paying for the name. Our server was pretty good but didn't check on us very much and that surprised me as it wasn't that busy and it is a little higher end location. The service wasn't bad just would expect a little more attention.  I also ordered the Nutella skillet cake and it was average. The consistency was soft and gooey which was nice but I didn't feel there was much more taste than when I eat Nutella out of the jar. One thing I think they should change is to allow their happy hour to extend from the bar area into the restaurant itself. The cocktail I had was also average and to be expected pricey. I would go back here but I feel like there are other places where I can get amazing food at cheaper price points.",

I ordered the Apple Endive Salad which was just a lovely mix of flavors and very light; the Grilled Trout - so fresh and seasoned well; and the Pretzel Caramel Tart which was like a chocolate/caramel candy bar with vanilla ice cream - large portion so I would recommend sharing this one.

    "text": "Came here tonight again for dinner because we had such a great dinner last time and yet again we had another awesome dining experience.   THE FOOD: Dish 1:  Rigatoni pasta Turkey Bolognese. Best dish we had tonight. So good. Loved the whipped Basil Ricotta in the middle.   Dish 2: Pork Snitziel. This dish was also very good. Big portions. The mustard sauce completed the taste of this filling dish.   Dish 3:  Salmon. Mom really loved it and said she would order it again when she comes back.   Dish 4: My sister got the Pasta Di Orecchiette. Very good pasta dish. Perfect mix of meat and veggies.   Dish 5: Mac and Cheese for my niece. It was so so. Not cheesy enough.   THE SERVICE: Zoe was our server tonight. She was very helpful and courteous. Didn't have to ever wait too long for anything. And Brad the manager was also very hospitable and treated our table well.   Had a great dinner tonight. Definitely recommend for anyone who wants to come to eat good food and have great service. The sports playing on the tv's at the bar is an additional plus!",

The space is new so super comfortable and the area is walkable.  I am a sucker for prosecco...and their $5 happy hour prosecco really can't be beat! One of the better proseccos I've tried, all for a whopping $5.  There are 7 food options under $10 for happy hour.  The pizza is on the smaller size (looks like a personal pan pizza) but everything else is shareable and tasty.    On top of all this, check in on Yelp or scan your TruFusion ID for an additional 20% off!  The only only only thing that would make this a 5 star was if the pizza was better and if they added $1 oysters on the menu =D",

Braised short ribs tasted decent but was just so ugly to look at.   Appetizers were on par with basic bar food.  Best part was the Trappist beer..   Slow, disorganized, borderline pompous, and lost most points because they brought my kids juice 3/4 of the meal through accompanied by a series of excuses. Oh and where was the two order of bread we ordered? I'm sure there was an excuse for that too but I can't recall. I think my last good WGP experience was at the LAX airport. Will keep to our usual spots at DT Summerlin.",

    "text": "Been here a few times whenever I visit family for holidays. I have had some good times and others a bit on the lower hand so I'll just be giving 3 stars. Let's start with the bad, the bartender named Brie, short for Brianna possibly, was rude and constant a Debbie downer trying to one up everyone she speaks to. I guess the customer isn't always right. The management is a complete 50/50 as well where you get one good manager and one bad, good cop bad cop I suppose just not enough good. There's a female who does walk around like she's in control but to be honest I don't even think she knows what's she's doing. Followed by the next one, Ian, I remember his name because he feels he has to be the loud one at all times in the dining area. Never greeted us, but ladies if you're between 19-23 years old you'll have all his attention. I honestly don't know if it's because he's gay, which I have no disrespect to seeing as I was raised by two mothers so none meant, or he just really wants to try and get every females number.   Now the good. Auggie the manager such a damn heart of gold as well as the chefs who actually came and spoke for a second and said hello. The drinks are always on point especially the damn old fashioned they make, can't remember the bartender who made it but she was sweet and great always smiling from ear to ear even if she looks like she isn't 21 but she is. To the other bartenders and not to mention the man named Mark. He has his own food truck which he cooks free meals for those in need. Hearts of gold these people.   I am moving back to the east coast but maybe in the future I may be able to visit once it's fixed and the management learns how to actually be managers and not pre teen 32 year olds.   -Brian",

Nothing spectacular. The burgers came with frozen fries. I would expect a Wolfgang restaurant to use fresh. I had the Chinese chicken salad which was quite tasty but a small portion for $16 not to mention it only had five to six minuscule pieces of chicken. My husband had the salmon. An approximately 4 oz piece served with a large amount of leafy greens for $27. The portion for rigatoni bolognese was a small portion as well for the $22 charged.  The portion sizes are disproportionate to the cost. The service wasn't anything special either. It was slow and our server wasn't very attentive to our party. She was tending the bar as well. Unfortunately, we won't be going back. Just all around lack luster food and just ok service.",

    "text": "They were very busy when I arrived at lunchtime and was seated fairly quickly despite a mix up over my reservation, which I later realized was my fault. We counted 30 plus staff, about 1:1 ratio to the customers dining inside. No doubt just for the opening until things get settled.   The focaccia bread was nice and my Summerlin Sour was a nice, tasty drink without being too strong, which was fine since it was lunchtime. The recc'd truffled potato chips w bleu cheese fondue was way too salty for me and not strong enough bleu cheese. We asked for the mac n cheese instead and were graciously accommodated. The pasta was fine and al dente, but the sauce was a bit bland and runny. More importantly, the crock it came in was barely lukewarm; mac n cheese should always be hot! We gently pointed this out and our waitress immediately said it would not be on our bill.  For the entrees, my partner loved his hamburger and two bites of it showed me that it was cooked perfectly med rare (although actually, he wasn't asked how he'd like it), very juicy, and flavorful. My pappardelle w oxtail ragout was also al dente but the thickness was a bit too heavy handed and there was very little oxtail. But because the service was so on point, they had just opened, and the burger was so tasty, I am awarding 4 stars and will be back next week to give them another shot!",

The problem was it was so salty that I couldn't finish the burger. It was my first experience with Wolfgang Puck and was probably my last. It left me with a sore stomach and wondering why it's popular.",

    "text": "It upsets me to have to post this scathing review, but people need to know that the staff as well as the manager at this fine establishment are racist, and they employ discriminatory practices in order to keep minorities out...allow me to expound...my friends and I, (all black)decided to go to Wolfgang Puck in Summerlin after enjoying dinner elsewhere in the plaza. After being seated, we were quickly told by Lauren that no outside food was allowed. I let her know that we would not be eating the food (I and another member of our party had bagged, to-go orders with us from the restaurant we had previously dined at). Lauren said that it did not matter that we were not eating it because any outside food was against Wolfgang Puck's policies. She said, \"so, I could throw it away\" we, of course, decided to leave rather than allow her to throw our food away. We sat by an outside fire nearby the restaurant, and we continued our evening. To my dismay about 10 minutes later a white man and his friend entered the restaurant with bags of takeout...my friends and I watched in disbelief as the man took a seat by the bar, and began ordering drinks! At no time did anyone approach this man and his friend to let them know that outside food was not allowed. I decided to go speak with the restaurant manager about the unequal treatment my friends and I had received. Chelsea (the manager) and Lauren (the hostess) proceeded to pretend (unconvincingly) that they had not seen the man and his companion enter with bags of takeout. They then went on to lie and say that the man's food had been thrown away; the food was still sitting on the bar! When we let the two women know that the food was still on the bar, Chelsea and Lauren suddenly remembered that the restaurant offers patrons the option of placing outside food on the counter. This realization came as news to my friends and me because placing our food on a counter was not an option that was offered to us. Our options were to throw our food away or to leave. It is a shame that in 2016 there are establishments that continue to employ discriminatory policies in an effort to keep the patrons that they desire in and the patrons that they find less than desirable out! I should not have to say this, but my friends and I are all young, black professionals. We have more degrees among us than there were people in our group. I will never step foot inside of another Wolfgang Puck restaurant. Racism is alive and well in 2016! SHAME ON YOU WOLFGANG PUCK!",

I agree that the menu is limited, but I believe most people should be able to find something to enjoy. I've tried a variety of items:  The burger (good) Spaghetti and meatballs (very good - homemade pasta that is, yes, cooked al dente) Half rotisserie chicken - tasty, and I'm not a huge chicken fan Special BLT type of sandwich at lunch - EXCELLENT  I've also heard from other diners that all of pasta dishes on the menu are very good.  The only dessert I've tried is the pineapple upside down cake, and it's been good.  For a non-alcoholic treat, try their Ginger-Lime Iced Tea. It's amazing!  The wine list is more limited than I would like, but I suppose it matches the menu variety. :)  The atmosphere is nice, the front desk staff is always super-friendly, and the location is really convenient for me. I do consider this one of my regular local restaurants and recommend you give it a try.",

I got the mesquite grilled burger cooked medium. Best burger I've had in awhile! Can't wait to try this place out again.",

Great feel to the restaurant, but not too busy. Pretty sad actually.  If I had one request it would be to bring back the shishito peppers. Other than that, I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "I ate here on a Friday night w my friend. We got there right at 5pm so there was no wait. It did fill up as we were eating dinner so get there early if you don't want to wait...though it didn't appear like the wait would've been very long if we had come later.  Our server was very nice & professional right off the bat. I had to wait a few minutes for my friend to arrive so he got us waters & was nice about waiting.  We ordered the house sangria to start. It was very good but not strong at all. We also ordered the crab louie appetizer and charred snap peas (a side) as a second app. Both were amazing. The crab louie was just delicious. Only regret was we were sharing because I could've easily eaten the whole thing. So good! The charred snap peas came with a harissa yogurt sauce that made the dish. It was so good. We actually save that sauce to put on our main dishes. The bread was also very good - crusty on the outside & soft inside.  We both ordered salads. I got the kale & spinach and I added salmon. My friend got the chopped and added chicken. My salmon was cooked perfectly but we both agreed that the salads we so-so. They weren't bad, just not wow like we expected after the delicious apps.  Throughout the meal we had great service. I also saw the manager throughout the evening interacting w guests & checking on meals. Overall thumbs up & I'll definitely be back...for the crab louie!",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner experience here last night, and it was boosted by the impeccable service we received upon entering all the way through exiting.  We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation time, and when I said we were early, the hostesses and someone that I think was maybe the manager waved it off like it was no big deal and sat us immediately.  As we walked to our table, we were greeted by waiters and servers as we walked by.  Very friendly.  The first table we sat at was right by the back door to the patio, so my husband asked if we could move away from the door, and she said of course and promptly moved us to a booth without any hesitation.  Our waiter (I think his name was Eric) came right over and was very attentive throughout the meal.  We ordered the cheese and salume board for an app.  It was a nice portion and the truffled honey was delicious.  Word of caution, the horseradish mustard will clear your nostrils out!  So spicy!  For dinner, I had the papperdelle with oxtail ragu.  The noodles were the definition of al dente and perfect.  The ragu had a slightly sweet flavor that made me keep coming back for more as I tried to figure out what it was.  My husband got the roast chicken, which was flavorful and so moist.  He also ordered the sweet potato as a side, but the maple butter on it made it a little too sweet for me.  It's also worth noting that their wines and cocktails are nicely priced.  I had a crisp New Zealand Sauv Blanc for just $8.  Most of the cocktails were around $11.  I see in some other reviews that people mention it is noisy in there, and that is True; it was quite loud in there.  But a restaurant can really be made on its service, and everyone here was friendly, accommodating, and welcoming without being overbearing.  We had a fabulous date night!",

Usually order the tuna tartare, made perfectly with these crisp chips that melt in you mouth. The happy hour cheese& charcuterie board is excellent and offers the perfect amount if you looking for a light bite. They offer a \"Sunday supper\" which is a prefix and that you pay(25$?) per person. However I feel your group size needs to be just the right size so the serving portions are evenly distributed. Because you want to try everything,  you're already stuffed by the 3rd course. Recommend going with that if you're in a group with hungry indecisive people",

Every time the service has been over the top and the food has been great. The staff shows every time was truly great customer service is supposed to look like. I have had many options here, but I love the salmon the best. It is always cooked to perfection with the right amount of crispiness to the outside. The yellow and green beans that come with are fantastic as well and provide a unique taste with the salmon. Their pizza is also one of a kind and I always hope to take some home to enjoy for the remainder of the week when we get to eat there. The blue cheese chips are phenomenal! I am not generally a huge blue cheese fan, but I these are down right awesome. The blueberry upside down cake is a great desert and most importantly the CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES! Holy Moly! They are great. I really appreciate the team and the management at this location and will continue to bring my family, business and parties here again and again!",

Chuck ordered the fried fish and there were three delicious and generous pieces that were perfect (lightly breaded and not oily) simply delicious. My friend from Atlanta ordered a Greek Salad with shrimp. The preparation and presentation were Amazing because The chef was Generous and very creative with the ingredients. I had a new Italian salad salume and it was also excellent . We will definitely return. We loved the decor and ambiance. Perfect atmosphere for a late dinner after a show on the strip.

We asked if we could be seated at quieter table, and the hostess accommodated us.   Within five minutes, sirens started going off. Flashing lights, klaxons, and a loudspeaker that told us to evacuate the building.  The waiter came to our table, and told us not to worry, they were just testing out the emergency response system. After he left, the loudspeaker again told us to a evacuate the building. It repeated this message at least 40 times.  He said they had to do this because it was a new building.  The alarm was very loud and lasted through the majority of our dining room visit..    We were given only a feeble apology.  We were never offered a complimentary drink, a complementary appetizer, or a complimentary dessert.  My recommendation to the management is to test equipment before dining service begins.",

We first requested a booth in the rear, but decided to sit in the bar area because it was brighter and more attractive to the eye. That is when we were told it was the Happy Hour area, and we were really Happy!  The menu had only 7 or 8 items for meals and 7 or 8 drink choices. but the choices were good ones.  The truffle fries were divine and we shared calamari, sweet potato fries, a pipette AND the chicken sliders.  We were pleasantly surprised and topped off the evening with a glass of Proseco and a lemon drop Martini. 5 dinner items and 3 cocktails later  (shared) we received a bill for 52.00!!  Great food at an affordable price. Sunday happy hour..great atmosphere for adults and families.. Definitely in my top 5 for light dining. Will go back soon and check out the full menu at a later date",

From the moment we walked into the door, until the moment we left it was fantastic! The service was impeccable, the food was fresh & delicious! My partner had home made past with Rabbit Ragu - YUM!! I had a rock shrimp pizza, which was a real pizza not a flatbread pizza ( Although I love FB Pizzas too) We started with the calamari. It was a perfect lighter dinner before heading off to the movies on our date night!  What is perfect about this place is you, you could sit down with friends after a day of shopping at Downtown Summerlin and have a yummy selection of 'family style' snack foods for the table, or you could sit down for an amazing 3 course dining experience!  Here is my insider tip- During the colder months, if you make a reservation ask for inside. They did not seem to make a difference between indoor and out door dining with reservations, it is just where there is a an open table. We sat out side under a heater, which was fine for us. But was also watched another table of 4 leave because they could not accommodate their reservation inside even after they said they were cold and uncomfortable outside.  Really happy to have this new gem in the neighborhood!",

The patio wraps around the building and allows the choice of shade or sun plus the addition of many umbrellas and  heaters. Service was prompt and friendly. There is a nice selection wines at a reasonable price point. The starter plate chosen was grilled spanish octopus with greens, fingerling potatos and romesco sauce. The octopus was nice and tender but not over cooked. The romesco sauce worked well with the greens and potatos. The size of this dish was just right. For the main event we choose the DTS chopped salad which large enough to be an entree. The salad had a variety of vegetables and varies by market availbility. On this day  it had several lettuces, tomatoes and olives plus quinoa and croutons all incorporated in a champagne vinaigrette. As an option chicken, salmon or shrimp can be added to the salad. Desert was a wonderful pineapple upside down cake with buttermilk pineapple sherbet.  The reastaurant is another great addition to growing number of dining choices in Downtown Summerlin.",

Finished off the meal with some warm chocolate chip cookies with plenty of chocolate chips and an espresso martini. The espresso martini isn't on the menu but Tiffany makes a great martini.  I love my espresso martini's and I would say this is in my top three in Vegas! But what made the evening and the 5 star rating was Ricky our server.

    "text": "The Holy Grail of huevos rancheros.  I've been searching all over Las Vegas for halfway decent huevos for years!    Crispy tortilla shells, layered with a well-spiced sauce, black beans, eggs and guacamole. Not a huge serving, so eat slowly. But excellent flavors.   Wife ordered egg croissant. Side salad is very fresh and the size is nice. But the dressing is overly sour for the dish. When fresh greens are slightly bitter to start with, this became too much. Wife LOVED the eggs. They were sooo fluffy. Ham is good, but a bit salty. The egg, ham and arugula in one bite is delicious, so keep your plate organized. And ask them to warm the croissant first.   Wife had ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, but sent it back. The sauce was excellent...but the meatballs were cold inside and the spaghetti was gummy. It was almost under-done on the inside.   Last time, wife had had pasta with seafood, and the pasta was gummy also. She ended up eating the seafood and leaving her pasta. Just in case you're not reading carefully:  DO NOT ORDER PASTA HERE.   Service is on point, but that's to be expected at a Puck spot.",

A few min later the host said a table opened in the bar if we wanted that so we gladly took it. Everyone was extremely pleasant and friendly which I appreciate. Drinks did take min but food was quick. My salad was wrong but they fixed it quickly. All the food was delicious and the Golden knights puck chocolate desert was the best ending to good company and a good meal.",

Ended up just getting it all to go and paid the bill before I got the food where I gave a $15 tip and they didn't even show me the food or check it themselves.   And you know once you get home it's to late to pack up your kids and go back... The waitress was nice but she and I should have checked the order.  The Place and food are about the same or less then that of a little Caesars or dominoes lol. They also turn the lights up and down while we where there for some reason.   Step up your food game Wolf Gang Puck! And with your prices and notoriety this is your end product !? Disappointed man disappointed and let down. What a waste of money. Never going to take my wife and or kid here again.   You should be embarrassed with that pizza! There are several small places here in town that know how to make a Margherita pizza with fresh basil and know what extra basil actually means. You should try them out, maybe take some notes.   And why are you going so sparingly on the cheese? Is the cheap cheese, olive oil, garlic budget that tight lol?",

It's a spot where you will often catch me grabbing some small bites that are all under $10 and paired with a glass of the Wolfgang Chardonnay. Happy Hour starts at 3pm and with $2 off any glass of wine, it's really hard to say no. Although I have only sat in the bar area, service has been spot on! You really see the servers and bussers come together to ensure an impeccable experience.  Recently I was just here for a quick lunch break where my pallet was craving fish Tacos. These are amazing! Covered in a chipotle spice and paired with slaw and a dollop of an aioli sauce, you get all the flavors in one bite - without everything falling out of it (that's the worse).  Next time, I hope it's the dinner menu that I get to indulge in. Until then, see you at 3pm!",

I've had this place on my bookmark list since it opened and am glad I finally checked this place out, but regret not coming sooner because the pizza I had was perfection. I came here with an open mind and had no expectations other than the what I'd usually expect from a WP restaurant which is exactly what I experienced. I personally find the menu to be spot on given it's a bar and grill and this place fits perfectly in Downtown Summerlin.   We started out with cocktails, I had the Classic Margarita, and we finished our meal with coffee and both tasted great.  Truffle Potato Chips ($9) - House-made potato chips infused with truffle oil and covered with Maytag blue cheese sauce and chunks of cheese. Get this! The chips taste great alone, but the cheese sauce just takes the chips to another level. My friend and I had no shame when it came to scraping up every last bit of cheese sauce we could from the bottom of the bowl. Very good!  Margherita Pizza ($15) - The sauce tasted so fresh and the crust had the perfect crispness. I loved every bite of this pizza and will absolutely order it again. Not surprising at a WP restaurant that the pizza was amazing. The price was fair given the quality ingredients and they do have gluten free crusts on small pizzas if that's your thing.  The HH menu is worth checking out and they also offer patio dining. I'll be back.",

Had to wait awhile for re-fills too. But they were under-staffed, she wasn't being lazy or un-attentive, she just had too many tables. Long story short, food was really good but too expensive for the portion and the average ingredients.   My friend got the seafood pasta which came with very little pasta and a few shrimp and small scallops and clams. Sauce was average and nothing amazing. My pasta was really good, but again, too expensive for what it was. The potato chips with blue cheese and truffle oil was really good. $9 for a bowl of chicken tortilla \"broth\" was not worth it - Yard House has way tastier chicken tortilla soup.   Thank goodness for the 20% off when you check-in on Yelp...still not worth it even after the discount.",

The calamari was undercooked, there were no joke 10 pieces maybe. The TBG meatballs were ok but looked pink on the inside. The Hot Tater Tots were literally microwaveable Tater tots splashed with some buffalo sauce and bleu cheese. We also ordered the \"salt and pepper\" chicken wings expecting salt and pepper wings but got what looked like buffalo wings. See attached picture. We asked 3 different waiters if they were sure this was the salt and pepper wings and they all looked confused and said yes. Maybe I'm wrong but all the other pics of s&p wings look like actual s&p. To top it off we spent $30 plus and ended up going to shake shack across the way. Save your money and go somewhere else for happy hour. Ok, rant over :)",

My cousin thought the burger was okay, as it was a little hard to eat due to it being a little bit overly messy for one to eat. I enjoyed the steak as it was cooked with flavor and was tender.",

    "text": "The Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill doesn't officially open until November 5, 2014, according to the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwolfgangpuck.com&s=c447e520fbd1610f9104aea0d0ae4ac856cce73df71ea4520b8706c3fd4eafdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wolfgangpuck.com</a> website, but I was lucky to stumble in on their soft opening a day early. All the head honchos were in attendance, from Wolfgang's \"right-hand\" man to the executive chef of Wolfgang Puck (as told to us by our waiter). Customer service, to say the least, was on point. All hands were on deck, and no one was left wanting.  Complimentary bread infused with herbs and olive oil was served in an adorable wooden bowl. The bread was incredibly soft, thick, and flaky too! We told our waiter to keep those bad boys coming. :)   For starters, I shared the artisanal cheese and salami plate ($16) with my better half. I was surprised that the plate came with only 2 types of cheeses, and was hoping for something grandiose due to the hefty price tag. When the plate arrived on top of a weathered cheese board, the pickings were slim. Call me plain, but the cheeses, sauces, and adornments on the plate were too \"fancy\" (i.e., overwhelmingly powerful and distinct) for my palate.    My husband ordered the mesquite burger for $13, which is damn cheap for the quality. He was ultimately only able to finish half the burger, so it was decent sized. I was told the burger was juicy, too. The fries were plentiful, fresh, and warm. I had to restrain myself from eating all his fries! There was only one snafu: he had to send the burger back because he ordered it medium well but was presented with a medium rare burger. The kitchen was quick to fix the problem and the manager himself came to our table not only to apologize, but insisted despite our protests that our dinner would be taken care of.    I ordered the rigatoni dish minus the turkey bolognese sauce ($15), opting for a tomato based sauce instead. The sauce was perfectly creamy and the dish was overall extremely filling.   The standard of customer service displayed here at Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill was unreal. The waiter literally helped seat me by scooting me in my chair and dropped a napkin across my lap. Our waiter was extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable on every menu item we asked about. My water glass was never empty and the employees frequently checked up on us to make sure everything was okay. I think my silverware was changed at least three times. Plates were cleared off almost immediately - it was like magic! When the waiter cleared our cheese plate from the table, he picked up a miniscule crumb of cheese off my husband's place mat (seriously). I was over the moon about the whole customer service experience.   To sum everything up: Ambiance: 4 Food: 4 Customer Service: 5+  I didn't save room for dessert, but the Monkey Bread was highly recommended by the staff. I will definitely come back to this new Wolfgang Puck location in Downtown Summerlin. I'm salivating over what I imagine the Monkey Bread will taste like, and would love to try the pizza next time! Customer service quality alone makes a return visit necessary, and is why I rated Wolfgang 5 stars. I hope that their standards for customer service will remain unchanged after some time passes. Keep up the good work!",

For our mains, I had the schnitzel and my wife had the spicy goulash, both of which were really delicious.  The schnitzel was pounded out flat and was a ginormous portion.  We finished the meal by sharing the German chocolate cake.  Crazy delicious!!!!  It was only our second time at this location and it was well worth it.

    "text": "Wolfgang Puck always been fan of in general. Lately seems like every \"star\" celebrity chef opens up different concept restaurants under the same name. It was my first time at his Bar & Grill concept restaurant. I have been to Spago and couple other ones. I have never had bad experience but times that just been ok. Bar & Grill fell under the ok. The potato chips with the blue cheese sauce or creamy goodies on top. Perfect combination! The only thing that would have stopped me from raving about it. The worst thing could do with potato chips thin sliced deep fried to order is getting lump of chips. Not individual nicely fried chips that take time drop them in the fryer or move it around rather then dump bunch in walk away. The combination solid. The Creamy Mac 'n' Cheese truffle crumbs. If there was one five star that stole the show was this dish. It not often rave about mac and cheese. I love love the fact that not super thick cheesy but nice creamy. You can taste the hint of truffle in the cheese and still has rich body from the cheese. The pasta not elbow variety but more Orecchiette style. Nice cause in each bite get full effect of sauce, pasta, and the truffle crumbs on top. Winnah. If I could order full size then appetizer I would be all over that pasta.   I ordered the Orecchiette Pasta, Italian Sausage, Cherry Tomato, Broccolini, fine herbs for my entree.  It was ok. The sauce was more light butter/cream sauce. It liked. It had ample and equal amounts of everything else. I also tried the calamari. Nothing special just ordinary calamari. It was Ohana family dinner so tried piece of my brother entree the grilled flat iron steak. Nothing stood out about that dish for me. Overall really ok no WoW factor or something that would make me want come running back again.   The service was awesome. The hostess that seated us, our waitress, and later management came checked make sure everything was good. All five star service without doubt for me. Friendly, attentive, and made the dining experience great one!   The interior decor is interesting. It open kitchen, You have almost chefs bar counter area right in front that can sit down eat. It good spot if dining alone. They have bunch of televisions in the restaurant keep you update on sports. The bar area once walk in on your left like the set up. It one long counter but like the design. Again got couple wide screens with games on watch over some drinks and conversations with friends.   It in great location in Downtown Summerlin.",

There is a pizza, salad, cheese and salami board, pasta, sea bass, ribs, cookies, and carrot cake.   The food was great.  However we all felt a bit rushed.   As we were enjoying our first course, they were being told that the food for the second course was ready.   Thus, there was a bit of a rush feeling which impacted the overall experience.  However the food was excellent.  I will probably return and try it again.",

Manager, WFA with long black hair and a middle aged WMA bartender were doing something on the POS. After a few the manager left, the bartender spoke to the two at the bar and then left himself.   Not once did the manager or bartender acknowledge that I was sitting there for 10 minutes. No \"I'll be with you shortly\" or anything. So I got up and left. I even asked the hostess if she saw me on the way out.   I think the Puck Group needs to put those two through customer service training again. It takes but a moment to make contact with a guest.",

We started off with truffled potato chips with maytag blue cheese fondue for $7.  Pretty yummy and very oily.  Good thing all 6 of us at the table shared it as our appetizer.    For my lunch, I went for the Italian fennel sausage pizza for $15.  It was very large, but I ate the whole thing because I am a piggy.  The pizza was tasty, but also quite salty and oily.  I wanted to try a pizza because that is what they are known for, but I think if I ever went back to Wolfgang Puck's, I would try to get something healthier next time.    The restaurant itself is quite nice and upscale, and the service is very good.  It's located in the middle of a very large and nice outdoor mall.  Too bad I didn't get to check out the rest of the mall, but the little bit that we saw while walking through looked quite nice.",

We came early and, except for eating at Wolfgang Puck's at some airports, this was my first time here. Wolfgang Puck is an icon. He is known for his food and creating innovative dishes. Since that is the case, and that was my expectation, why is the menu so boring? The same-old appetizers that everyone else has plus the same-old pizzas, burgers, salads, and pasta. We had -  Wife had wine...I had beer...and... Appetizer - Buffalo Blue Tator Tots (needed more bacon...maybe some jalapenos) Black Bean Soup (excellent!...could have been a little spicier) Wife had the Chopped Chicken Ceasar (same as everyone else's) I had the Salume/Jalapeno Pizza (This was tasty...but not mind-numbingly good)  If your name is Wolfgang Puck...I would have thought that the food would be as impressive as the reputation. (and don't make me ask for salt and pepper shakers...put them on the damn table)  Not a bad place...just a place.",

    "text": "This was to be the last hurrah meal during the weekend in Vegas.  Since I had grown tired of dealing with Strip traffic, I nudged my travel companions to checkout Summerlin since I knew it'd be quieter yet as (if not more) upscale than the Strip.  I was not disappointed!   I had been to a Wolfgang Puck concept in Tulsa, OK a few years back and greatly enjoyed the dish I had (bacon-wrapped meatloaf and mash potatoes), and I found the food just as scrumptious at this bar & grill.  We were greeted by friendly waitstaff as we entered and asked our preference on seating.  We chose the patio as the restaurant wasn't packed.  My dining companions ordered bottomless mimosas (affordably priced!) and enjoyed swift refills.  We ordered brunch food and all had positive reviews on the taste and quality.  I in particular had french toast which had the consistency of funnel cake yet blew my mind!  It was a bizarre combination of high and low but it totally worked.  The toast was served with traditional maple syrup and a berry sauce.  The funnel cake style french toast was so savory that I only used the raspberry sauce and abstained from the syrup.  I also ordered a side of bacon which was acceptable as expected.    While the food should always be the star of a Wolfgang Puck grill, I found the atmosphere and service to be the standouts.  The patio was designed with foot traffic in mind and we were seated at an adequate distance from our neighbors so as to not invade their space. Seating was comfortable and our metal table was sturdy.  The interior of the restaurant was spacious with a modern flair (lots of steel and smooth industrial floors).  Lastly, we didn't have to flag down our server ever and checkout was a breeze.  Recommended with gusto!",

She gave the other couple at the bar her attention. The manager got wind of our experience and gave us a 20%off card for next time if there is a next time. I wasn't looking for a discount but I was looking for another glass of wine and dessert but I ended up leaving because I was really upset about the lack of service. I give two stars because the food was good.",

The hostesses were very friendly and even tho there was a wait (for obvious reasons, all of DT Summerlin was a zoo), we were seated fast. The manager Jason and his team were amazing! It's rare to find a restaurant this busy with fast, prompt, attentive service with the food made and tasting as it should. Never were we left needing a drink refill, or any need not taken care of. And they did it with a smile! Even though it was a crazy busy environment, everyone seemed to be helping each other and enjoying the hustle and bustle. This is what you want for a restaurant. Nice people, efficiency, well seasoned food, fast service, fun environment. So glad we chose to come here instead of the other restaurants in DT Summerlin. Jason and his crew have it down! Thank you for a fun night, even our 7 and 2 year olds enjoyed themselves. Adults and kids alike had an awesome experience. Thank you for a great holiday evening!",

    "text": "The food here is certainly tasty. And the service is AMAZING. For our appetizers we got the buffalo cauliflower and the tater tots, which was kind of a bad idea on our part since they both have buffalo sauce in them. Those tater tots were perfect. If you think you have had good tater tots, you haven't tried these. You have to try them. I got the wienerschnitzel, which I learned from the server is what Wolfgang orders whenever he comes. The food was perfect. Then dessert came. I don't know how so many things went wrong and everything came out right. I think it is the service. If it weren't for our waiter, everything would be ruined. We ordered the bread pudding and the skillet cake. Our server came over later and told us they were out of bread pudding. We got the creme brulee instead. We waited for a strangely long time, and then the dessert sort of came out. The creme brulee came out fine, but instead of the skillet cake, we got a brownie looking thing with chocolate sauce. We asked him about how this isn't a skillet cake, and he told us they didn't make that anymore, and they use a brownie instead of the cake. But, he informed us, they forgot to put ice cream on top of the brownie. So, he took it back to get ice cream. We ate the creme brulee, and it was delicious, actually my favorite dessert. A little while later, a plate of tiramisu came out. The server told us it was on the house. Of course we were happy, who doesn't want free dessert? Then the brownie WITH ICE CREAM came out. It was good, but it was really nothing that special. But GEEZ the server was nice. By the end, we got free tiramisu, paid only three dollars for the brownie, and got twenty percent off the meal for their mistakes. I mean, what's wrong with that. The excellent service here really saved this experience.",

As we were getting closer to Wolfgang's all I could hear were barking dogs on the patio and I new this was my spot. Everyone sitting on the patio on Sunday had a dog or 2 with them. I love that they are so welcoming of dogs here. They even bring out big bowls of ice water.  Bri was our waitress and she is a dog lover. Bri brought us the menu and had those bottomless mimosas at our table in seconds. This was our first time here and Bri gave us some great recommendations. We ordered all of them. And I love the fact that Bri was honest and told us the large pizza was too big for just the 2 of us since we were ordering other things.   We ordered the Huevos Rancheros w/ Black Beans. I order this at every restaurant because it is always different. This was excellent-- I have never had it where the tortillas were crunchy like a tostada. I would go back just for this meal.  Next up was the Small Smoked Salmon Pizza w/ dill cream, red onions and a little dollop of caviar. I did like this pizza but it had way too much salmon on it for me. The BF loved it and ate most of it. If I ordered it again I would probably order it with light salmon. I know that sounds weird but just my preference.  The grand finale was the Truffle Potato Chips w/ Blue Cheese. Yes you read that right. TRUFFLE POTATO CHIPS. Woo Hoo- they were so good. Chips tasted homemade and the the blue cheese sauce was very light and just everywhere. They were perfect.   You can never go wrong with bottomless mimosas so we made sure to take full advantage of the bottomless. This restaurant is really beautiful and I love the patio seating. It was so nice and relaxing. I love that it's in the back and you don't get the mall crowd walking by staring at you.  Go check this place out, sit outside and ask for Bri. We will be back for sure.",

But let's talk about the food... from their cauliflower chicken dish (pictured below) to their pasta, pizza, salmon, salad, you name it- it's ALL delicious!! They are also super accommodating and understanding. For instance, one time I asked for an iced coffee and the nice waitress said they didn't have that, but that she would check if they could figure something out and MAGIC she made it happen. Subsequently, we came here on my dads birthday last month and the manager personally came over to shake our hands, introduce himself, sent out many complimentary appetizers & desserts, and printed \"Happy Birthday ____\" with my dads name on our menus. So thoughtful! I could never imagine having a bad experience here and always look forward to coming back!",

They kept my glass full and my stomach also with great appetizers and hearty servings in their main dishes even though I had my daughter with me and she made a mess. I made sure to clean it up. We also sat outside because I know she tends to be a wild one. They even accommodated to my daughter's palette as well, serving us some cauliflower tots. My only negative comment is that they asked to box up the rest of my food and they ended up tossing everything away. We bought a lot of food and I'm disappointed that my money went to waste.",

My husband loves his bottomless mimosas so we came here for that purpose. The bartender was actually our server and whenever she saw the glass almost empty she  was always there to fill out up. I had the berry smoothie which was good but the after taste was sour.   We ordered the avocado toast to start. When it came out it was over piece of toast with avocado, tomato, radish and a handful of salad. We had different expectations because everywhere else we get avocado toast it comes in either two or three smaller breads.   For our entree we shared a barbeque chicken pizza. The pizza was okay. Not the best I've had but I managed to eat a couple of slices since I didn't really eat much of the avocado toast.   Overall, if you're coming here for bottomless mimosas I recommend sitting in the bar area. The bartender was very attentive and super friendly. The food was okay, but if you do dine in don't forget to check in!",

    "text": "Delicious meal, exquisitely prepared with star service!  Being in the mood for something special, but one where I didn't have to get changed into something fancy, I chose to dine at Wolfgang Puck tonight. I have been going for a few nights for dinners and lunches, but I have never tried their tasting menu.  Dining on my own, I thought it would be perfect since I wanted to try new dishes, but didn't have to deal with a massive amount of food on my own. Generally, the tasting menu is for 2 or more people, but the staff   took pity on a solo diner.   It's not because they let me try it that I'm gushing, but it's been a while in Summerlin where I feel I've had a perfect meal. I have my favorites in town, but, let's just say that it's been a while since I've so thoroughly enjoyed my meal like tonight.  To start, the staff was friendly, inviting, and accommodating. The service was well paced, and not intrusive. I portion sizes for the tasting meal was perfect for me, and you get five dishes, so it filled me up. Some may think it small, but I think it's exactly the amount of food - actually they give you more than what one should eat healthily for a dinner.   The tasting menu consisted of 5 dishes. 1) an appetizer of salmon tartar - two oval mounds with creme fraiche and two large pieces of potato chip. The salmon was seasoned with a bit of crunch from cucumbers. It was mild in flavor, but the potato chips made a difference. It was clean tasting and and just enough to get my appetite going. Really good!  2) I've been eating a lot of their WP Chopped, and never tasted the Apple Endive. It's my new favorite. It has endive, macaron almonds, fennel, apples, and I forget what else. It comes with dots of balsamic, and it's crunchy, vinegary, sweet, and savory. Loved it!   3) Pappardelle with boar was fabulous. I'm going to run out of superlatives to describe my meal. The pasta was thinner than most pappardelle, so that you can almost see your fork on the other side. The sauce was just sticky enough to coat each of the strands, and it was perfectly seasoned. I usually ask for chili flakes on my pasta, but I didn't even ask for it this time, because it was really flavorful. After this dish, I was getting full, and wondered how many dishes were in a tasting menu here. I finished everything. I'm on a low carb diet as well, but I ate the whole thing. It was just enough for me not to feel guilty. If I weren't on low carb, I'd definitely order this many times.  4) The market fish. I forgot what fish it was, but it was flaky and cooked well. I loved the foam. I think the server said it was some mushroom flavor... I don't know. But it was slightly salty, and ethereal - yeah, it's foam so it doesn't linger. The skin on the fish was crispy. I peeled it off and ate the whole thing first. So yummy. then, I squeezed the charred lemon on the rest of the fish and spinach. This dish is flavorful, but also super health. I'm on weight watchers, and on the program, I can probably eat this all night long. Excellent!  5) Finally, the dessert was cheesecake. Not just any cheesecake, but one that is creamy, moist, with texture that was substantial but also melted with a great mouthfeel. It came with fresh berries, whipped cream, and coulis. It was just the right amount of sweetness. I had to really work on my will power not to finish it, but it hit the spot.   This was the perfect meal I was craving all day, and they delivered. THANKS for a great meal. AND, for $50, I think I'd go back again. Maybe it's not an every day meal for every one, but it sure felt like a value to me for all that I tried. The portions for me were great, and I'm not overstuffed and feeling uncomfortable after the meal. It was healthy, and super tasty.   Wolfgang Puck has really kicked it up a few notches.",

Plenty of staff but no one bothered to fill my cup once with water. My first and last time at this place. I wouldn't recommend coming here. Wolfgang Pucks name gets people through the door but service and food are what keeps customers coming back. You get better mussels at Red Rock Station next door.....that's far from being a complimentary statement.",

My son had the flank steak and it was cooked Medium rare as requested and was seasoned perfectly. It's amazing how many places can't cook a steak right but they do here. My wife had the  Pizza. It was good, she had the cheese this time, after having the pepperoni last time. I had the salmon and it was so good. Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Love a fish with a crust. Came with arugula salad and a bean ragout. The bean ragout was just ok, some were pretty hard. I ordered a side of Mexican street corn and it was so delicious it more than made up for the bean ragout. Seasoned with a chili lime and cheese it was so good I ate every kernel. We'll be back again soon I'm sure!",

However, lunch Saturday is what brought us back for brunch on Sunday and I preferred the Saturday lunch over the Sunday brunch.  Saturday we ordered the Orecchiette (sausage and broccolini) and the chicken salad sandwich. Both were awesome and would definitely go back for and reorder.  The chicken salad sandwich came on a bread with fruit and nuts in it and was awesome!  Sprouts, golden raisins, grapes, almonds so great!  Nice bathrooms, food size bar, and on Saturday they sell fresh bread to take home.   Sunday we had brunch pics to follow. We had the turkey burger, the stuffed berry French toast, and the charcuterie plate.  There was a lamb chopper cheese on the charcuterie plate that was really tasty and the prosciutto was good quality.  The turkey burger was a solid burger with pepper jack and fresh veg toppings (yum).  The French toast was ok.  It's a bit heavy but not to sweet.  The fresh fruit on top was a great addition (unlikely to reorder the french toast). But would maybe opt for the waffle instead.    Overall price point for quality was great.  And lunch there will happen again soon.",

Pros -Waitress was nice -Decent Salads   Cons -Terrible seating (we were literally seated at the entrance and inches away from the table next to us)  -Steak was awful -Sea Bass was unimpressive  -I wouldn't of even paid half of the amount of money we spent for the quality of food we received.

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at how good this place was. A lot of restaurants trade on the name of a famous chef but don't deliver the quality. Cut, however, is one of my favorite places in Vegas so I was willing to give this place a chance, and it delivered.   First, i would suggest a reservation as its usually pretty busy. In fact before I got in I tried to make a res on 2-3 other nights and they were fully booked. I think that has died down a bit now that its been open for a while but its still pretty busy.  Second, I thought the service was great. One small example- as a manly man I am not a big fan of \"splitting\" entrees, there are few things more emasculating than admitting to a server you can't finish the arugula Caesar salad on your own. When I went here I got talked into splitting Steak Frites with someone and as embarrassing as that could have been they brought it already divided on 2 separate plates and gave each of us a monster portion of fries that allowed me to leave with some small semblance of my dignity in tact. Its the little things. The steak was good, but the fries were amazing- I know I know how good could regular fries be? Turns out pretty good.   Third, Location- its past the movie theater and close to CREAM. There isn't a lot of parking immediately around it though. Having never been to downtown Summerlin I asked a few people for directions and they were all pretty inaccurate.   If I HAD to come up with a criticism I would say that the App section is a little lackluster.",

There were at least 3 open four top tables I could see. I went by myself and when telling the hostess \"just one\", she went over and consulted with someone, possibly a Sever. She came back and offered me a table literally sitting with a party of 10 men, it was a two top that was pushed up against their table and you would have been essentially been joining their party. I asked her if that was all she had, and she hesitated, as if she didn't want to give me a four top table and I was taking up space. I am not insecure, however being a female and being offered a seat at a table with a party of 10 men is not of interest to me, and I am sure would have been awkward for the group already sitting there. I planned on ordering nice wine, a nice appetizer and meal, and most likely would have spent more money than 2 people taking up a 4 top. I let the hostess know that since I was taking up space I would go somewhere else. Very disappointing experience and service for a Wolfgang Puck restaurant!",

Paying $24 for a salad and $10 more to add a couple strips of chicken so thin that my girlfriend begins to become impressed with me is blasphemous. Once again moreover, asking politely to our server who will not be named (Isaac) responds with \"Yup\" after everything isn't just rude but really annoying. If my previously mentioned girlfriend wanted to here yup from someone after every question; we would've stayed at home and she could've asked me to do work around the house. Next time I go to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant I expect to get fisted from him personally instead of the service and prices for those services.  Restaurant is pretty clean though.",

Cox was holding a very loud gathering at the bar. Felt more like a sports bar then anything that would have Wolfgang's name on it.  The happy hour pricing on the apps was good however the plate of calamari was tiny. Compare this to the size of the calamari app at Sienna. Night and day.",

The restaurant looked beautiful inside and was very inviting I loved that you could see the kitchen. I loved he wood door. I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and loved every single bite. Chicken was so tender and juicy and the cashews and wontons were perfect. Also we ordered the fish and chips. Fries were seasoned to perfection and fish was crispy and good! The only thing that would have made this better was the service! It wasn't anything to complain about I just would have expected more with such great food for high prices.",

The service was painfully slow, a meal that should have taken no more than an hour or so dragged on for over two hours. Most of that time was spent t waiting, drinks were never refilled, in fact my boyfriend waited for so long for a refill that all of the ice in his glass had melted and he drank that until empty. We ordered dessert and the salted caramel ice cream was so salty that all 3 people at the table agreed it was completely inedible.  I could go in to more detail on how atrocious our service was, but truly I feel that I don't want to waste more of my time on this place. Suffice it to say, we wont be back.",

    "text": "Decent food, but nothing awesome. Overpriced in my opinion. The menu is extremely limited -- out of perhaps 10 entrees, three were Italian. Not really a bar and grill. I had the chicken Calabrese ($25) -- two pieces of chicken with a few cherry tomatoes, a couple of tiny grilled onions and peppers in a nice sauce. That was it -- it would've killed them to pipe a few mashed potatoes around the edge? Something more than just chicken in a pan? My friend had fish and chips ($21). Fish was 6-7 smallish pieces, nicely done and the steak fries were yummy.  The service is definitely lacking. We had to ask for the malt vinegar, we had to ask for water refills, and nobody ever came by to say \"is everything all right?\" This place is definitely bare bones. No bread basket, the entrees don't come with even a basic salad, and there is no salt and pepper on the table. That always irks me as in \"the chef knows what he's doing and if you can't appreciate the subtlety of his expertise, you shouldn't be eating here. There's a Denny's down the street, you peasant.\"   In reading these reviews, I see there is some kind of Yelp perk, so I would definitely go through them if I ever go back -- which I don't plan to do.",

We ordered some appetizers and they were delicious, but the star of the evening was the fish, I ordered the Idaho Trout and my wife the Sea Bass, they were phenomenal, very well prepared and so delicious that I could have ordered another one for myself. The sauce was super tasty and added more flavor to the fish.  And we also loved the sides, broccolini, caramelized corn and the Fava beans was really good.  My wife loves the cheesecake here.  We can't wait to go back.  This is the best restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas.  And we really like that it is a celebrity chef restaurant that we can afford to go to.  Wonderful experience!",

I usually can't eat a lot all at once..but that didn't even matter here.

I really enjoyed my Rose (not too sweet but light and fruity) and also their Moscow Mule.   We ordered the Heirloom Caprese, Crispy Calamari, Artisanal Charcuterie Platter, Salmon Tartare Potato Chips, and Spiced Cauliflower. Among these, I enjoyed the Heirloom Caprese since it was fresh and tangy, and the mozzarella on the Caprese was perfectly melted over fresh tomatoes. The Artisanal Charcuterie Platter was packed with flavor, and the cured cuts of meat were really tasty with the cheese varieties and toasted bread. I also think this was a good choice since it pairs well with wine. The Spiced Cauliflower was a popular favorite among my group, but I personally felt it to be a bit bland.   I didn't enjoy the Salmon Tartare Potato Chips and the Crispy Calamari too much. The salmon was lacking tanginess or flavor or something, it just was forgettable. With the crispy calamari, it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked and some pieces felt a bit soggy and it also was lacking in the flavor component.   For the main courses, we ordered the Rigatoni, which for me was nothing special. However, I loved their Sausage Pizza! The crust was perfect and so was the ratio of cheese to sausage. The bread here in general is yum, including the free bread.   I would have given this place a 5 since the service was phenomenal and the experience was great, but just a few dishes for me fell short. I would definitely come back for the Pizza and the Wine!",

Which at most places would be great, except that it was for literally 9 pieces of small calamari. $1 per small piece of fried calamari is insane. I don't think I've seen that at any other place before. On top of that the $8 chicken wings for the happy hour menu was for 4 pieces of chicken. That's $2 per piece of chicken. Just take a look at the attached pictures. I still can't believe the food portions we received.   Some of the slightly more reasonable offerings include the truffle potato chips at $5, the chicken nachos, and the fries. I absolutely hate that one can slap on a celebrity chef name onto bar food and call it fancy and think it's okay to charge absurd prices for small portions of food even for happy hour.

    "text": "Yikes! This place was such a disappointment... We were seated right away on the outdoor patio. That's pretty much where the quick service stopped and for a Friday night at 8pm, partially filled restaurant, the service was pretty bad.   Our waitress came by several minutes later to greet us and get our drink orders, but by then we also knew what we wanted to eat so we put our order in all at once and only ordered appetizers to share. We had ordered 2 glasses of wine and waited nearly 25 mins for those to come out. We actually considered getting up and leaving as nor our wine or food had come out yet, but figured it would be more of hassle to find another restaurant, walk to it with a baby, sit and order food all over again then to just sit and wait here instead. So we waited some more and finally 2 of our 4 appetizers came out just before our wine. I noticed we had no utensils to eat with, so luckily the waitress hadn't darted away yet and I was able to let her know.   It wouldn't of been such an annoyance if we were just paid attention too. It was like, all the guests seated in the patio were left to fend for themselves. Even the 3 girls that were seated after us were left there. The waitress noticed our annoyance and offered us a complimentary dessert which were cookies. COOKIES. Which was nice, I guess, but also took another 20 minutes to get. What would've been a better recovery solution was if she just took off the extra $3 charge, that she charged us for, for ordering veggie sticks to eat with our hummus plate.   $100 later and with all of that being said, going to In N Out would've been the better choice.",

    "text": "Finally gave this place a visit for happy hour. The vibe and ambience of this place is great, I really liked the look of the place and it was comfortable.  Sat at the bar about 5 minutes before HH ended and the bartender was able to get my order in quickly. I got an order of the salt&pepper wings, parmesan fries and calamari. The food was pretty tasty, out of all my favorite were the wings. Definitely try those they are full of flavor. The only down side is that you only get 4!! The fries were a good portion and the calamari was good as well.  Can't forget the liquor - I tried the Summerlin Sour and this cocktail is probably what's gonna keep bringing me back. So refreshing, tasteful and the texture with the egg whites was perfect. Ended up having 3 with my girlfriend. Must try!  4/5 stars because I wasn't amazed with the happy hour food choices, but next time I will have to try the main menu.",

It might be a little pricier versus your normal Applebee's/chilies but this place has excellent food. The ambiance is a bit rustic, contemporary. I recommend this place for any occasion, including staff lunches. The usually get a salad with chicken, and oh man, it's amazing! Leave room for the golden knight puck dessert!",

    "text": "The food and the service were as good as each other. I ordered the Braised Beef Shortribs entree. It came with roasted roots on the side (small carrots, shallots & potatoes), polenta and gremolata. The vegetables were very tasty, with perfect spices. Simplicity and flavors both shined on this plate. The rib meat was large and fall-apart delicious. It had a savory barbequed glaze. When I say fall-apart, I really mean it. Even cutting across the grain posed no need for a knife. It was perfectly cooked, served on top of a small bed of creamy polenta and topped with gremolata.   I usually only drink water when I eat, and this meal was no different. A quick inquiry by the server determined that I like mine tepid, with no ice. My request was met with sincerity. Most servers would never have bothered to ask, or remember. During my meal, I was met by no less than three servers, and possibly one manager, all asking me if everything was ok, and if they could get me anything that I might want. Great service, even though 95% of the place was full.   I was seated inside right away, where it was very full and busy. I dined alone on this occasion, being lunch. The full menu is available during business hours. It's all one big menu, not separated like what the website shows. Some dinner selections I saw on the menu had different details from what I saw online. So, I believe their website is out-of-date.   A Vegas Golden Knights team jesey is displayed on the wall with the name PUCK. See the photo! I look forward to my return to this restaurant. I remember visiting the WP Bar & Grill restaurant at the MGM a few years ago. I was surprised at the combined quality and price. In visiting this location, I was not let down one bit. Good job, everybody! Thanks!",

I ordered the Grilled Flat Iron Steak (medium) with the Parmesan Fries and Chimichurri (I'm assuming that's either the onions that topped the steak. I should google it.)  It didn't take long for the food to arrive. The fries were fries... nothing spectacular. I asked if they had blue cheese dressing (for my fries) and the server said that he would check! Lo and behold... they didn't! BUT the made some for me!!! How cool is that? That joint was delicious! I should have gotten their recipe.  The steak was grilled perfectly! And it tasted great! The onions were great too. I ate most of them by themselves. I finished my fries first, so I could enjoy my steak. I dipped the steak in the blue cheese and it made the steak that much more betterer! I should have gotten that recipe!  It's not a \"must eat here\" restaurant for future visits, but I know it's an option when I'm back here with the Mrs and she wants a nice dinner away from The Strip!",

I left hungry after spending a $125 for 3 people. Never will go back.   Well I went back for happy hour, what a ripoff, they lowered the prices & down sized portions so it all comes back to regular prices. The calamari (rip-off)  Just a small amount for $9 & I mean SMALL I probably would have been better off ordering off regular menu.  Yes $5 wine but they made up for it on everything else. I don't understand restaurants that have happy hour but really don't want to have happy hour because they don't want to give up there profit margins that they are use to, so why do they do it ???? Go somewhere else, that's my advice. The best part that gets me is do they think we are dumb? I find it insulting .",

As an adult woman going out for a drink at 5:30pm, the last thing I expect at a bar are 7 year old children sitting with their \"single\" parents, Absolutely unfun and inappropriate and certainly not meant for a happy hour type of atmosphere. Again the drinks are $13 each. Again it is a waste of my money and time. Last time for me. I have never seen children at a place for adults in a bar setting. How ridiculous is that? is that parenting or what? Are there any adult men and women having a social time there?   Count me out. Sorry I lost my money there.",

Best thing was that he was only familiar with the yelp check in promo at Spago, but he asked his manager about the yelp checkin at Wolfgang summerlin and figured it out promptly.   He recommended the old fashioned, i like old fashioned's and enjoyed the flavor of their version. A little bit on the sweeter side, but a great way to introduce a girl to the classic bourbon drink.   Starters we had happy hour appetizers which are every day from 3-7pm. Yay for extended happy hour time! We had the calamari and chicken nachos. Everything came out hot and cooked perfectly.  Entrees we had the braised short rib, brick chicken, and the rigatoni. Very delicious Short rib was super tender, very tasty and the mashed potato was wonderfully seasoned. I didn't try my friend's chicken, but they said it was very good, not dry. Just noce and juicy. My rigatoni pasta was a little undercooked, was a little salty, but with a little bit of the cheese, it cuts the saltyness. One little downside didn't hurt my experience at all.   Dessert was red velvet cheesecake, it had a nice dark chocolate mousse between he cheesecake and the red velvet crust.",

We live the food here, the quality is top notch and the service is always genuine and friendly. My daughter loves the spaghetti meatballs from the kids menu which has a very good variety as well. They have great pizzas, amazing fish and really good hamburger too. We always order the homemade potato chips with blue cheese, it's addictive! If you like Mexican flavors you can always find a good option on the menu as well, I love to start off with the tortilla soup, it's delicious. Overall, this is a great restaurant to bring your family for a nice meal and I highly recommend seating outside in the patio area when the weather is nice.

    "text": "Sunday Brunch is one of my favorite things in life, especially when it involves bottomless mimosas with fresh-squeezed juice.   When my buddy and I arrived, we were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The service was all-around great.  In addition to the mimosas, I chose to order the Huevos Rancheros. The sauce was some of the best I've had for this dish. Creamy avocado, black beans, egg and cotija cheese made this dish a hit in my book.   My buddy ordered the Lobster Benedict. I am a little shy when it comes to anything seafood, but this dish was great. It wasn't an overpowering fishy taste, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was nice and creamy.  Looking forward to coming back some time to try their other dishes.",

Plus, the wood fired pizza oven makes it extra amazing. Okay, enough about that... The waiters and waitresses are very professional and they know their stuff. I also really like the ambiance here. The restaurant has an industrial cool vibe, not too stuffy. The patio is really nice too, when it isn't hot out. The prices are on the high side, but I always get the pizza ($14), so I can't complain.",

I had the Big Eye Tuna Tartare as my entree and it was delish.  Hubby had the Chinese Chicken Salad which had the biggest cashews I've ever seen on it.  He said it was perfectly dressed.

There literally were no other tables aside from us and our waiter did not care to ask us if we were okay, for refills, and it took her forever to even come to our table in the first place. You pay 100 dollars for a meal and you expect a little better service, don't you think? I guess just stick to CUT by Wolfgang Puck, they have way better service but it's also at the strip and you are spending about 400 + dollars for your meal so maybe they train them better there.",

    "text": "One of the better restaurants in downtown summerlin for sure. Wolfgang your trademark name once again delivers. The restaurant is pretty upscale and even the door to get in is huge and imposing but I definitely dig it.   Obviously food matters most so lets get right into it:  -Free range chicken wings. I think these are pretty great. I have spoken to people who say otherwise and I get their point, they arent crispy that is True. They have a thick glaze and arent fried but I don't mind that texture. The glaze is great with a small amount of kick. I could eat a lot of these  -Hand made meatballs. Very yummy no question. You can go to all kinds of restaurants and get a meh meatball but this is not one of them. Worth a taste  -Cheese and meat board. Pretty good I'd say. Nothing blew me away but it's cheese and meat and all of them were edible and fairly enjoyable.  -Prosciutto Arugula pizza. I dont see this on the menu so it may have been a special. Not quite my favorite. I've had plenty of these pizzas before and usually like them but the cheese prosciutto and arugula ratios were way off. The arugula amount overpowered everything else and make the pizza bitter.  -Rigatoni Pasta. Delicious and very filling. Bolognese sauce is great as is the ricotta. It's simple and a great meal no question.  So, the place isn't perfect that's for sure. I haven't loved everything I've tried but it's definitely more likely to be a hit than a miss on any given night. I've gone a handful of times and expect to go again. I recommend you do the same.",

I offered the Pearfect Martini, very delicious and included vodka and pear syrup.  For appetizer we ordered the chips with warm truffle cheese and blue cheese crumbles, very good. As well we had the fried calamari, the marinara sauce was also great. And finally me and my friend split the papardelli pasta with ox meat, good thing we did because the entree would of being too big for just me. The ox meat is shredded, and you can tell the pasta is home made which the server did confirm.   I wish I remember the server's name but I was impressed that at the end of our meal he came up to me and asked me about the food but actually then asked me to really critique it and mention what we didn't like or could of been better. I said the chips had a good amount of cheese but I personally would of liked more cheese. And for the calamari it could of been a little more crisper, but still very good. And I had no complaint at all about the papardelli.",

    "text": "Pretty good spot to grab a bite if you're up in the Downtown Summerlin mall area!  Like Wolfgang's other places, this restaurant is consistent and also offers of good selection of tasty delights.    For my drink, I had the daily healthy fresh pressed juice.  Today's special was spinach, kale, celery, ginger, orange, and apple.  It's not bad combo and tasted alright.  For the appetizer we had the calamari, roasted vegetable pizza, and a side of french fries.  The calamari was awesome, two sauces for you to dip your calamari and some battered veggies as well.  The roasted pizza was very good as well, the broccolini added a nice texture to the pizza.  Normally I like a meaty type of pizza, but for a change I decided to try the roasted vegetable pizza and I'm glad I did.  Nothing special about the fries, skinny type fries, but the nice thing is the side of fries is a nice hearty portion and great for sharing.  For dinner we had the mushroom pasta and a side of broccolini.  The mushroom pasta had great flavor, but the one thing I wasn't a fan of was some of the pasta had clumps of salt which made it really salty for some bites.  The brocolini stir fry side was a nice compliment to the meal, a little subtle spicy kick to it.    As for dessert, we had the apple crotada.  Basically, a fresh baked open faced apple pastry with a side of vanilla ice cream.  Since it's fresh baked, it takes a few minutes longer.  This was really good, the pastry was very flaky and warm right out of the oven.  The apples weren't too sweet and a little tart which I like.  Definitely a dessert I'd get again.  Service at the table was pretty good.  The odd thing is with the hostess, we got there and had to sit at the community table since we didn't make a reservation per the hostess even though 80% of the restaurant wasn't full at that time.  Even after we were done with our meal, paid and got up to leave the main dining area they had about 40% of the main dining area open not counting the outside patio dining area that no one really sat at since it's cold outside.  It seemed odd to push people to the community table to sit next to each other when it wasn't super busy.  Maybe the hostess was still training, but I'd recommend making a reservation given our experience if you and your party want a more private dining experience.",

The food came out hot, and stayed warm while we dined.    The ambiance was nice- obviously you're in the middle of a casino, and the restaurant has no walls, so you can hear the noise- but it wasn't bad at all.    Our server was AWESOME!  I'm disappointed we can't remember his name ... possibly Zak.  He gave us great menu ideas, brought out a delicious bottle of Cabernet (Justin), and was very attentive.

    "text": "BEST KEPT SECRET IN SOUTHERN NEVADA!  As i write this review, i'm torn!  On the one hand, i have been enjoying this spectacular dining experience for weeks, practically by myself and i love it!  I WANT TO KEEP THE SECRET!  On the other hand, i owe the dining public, who appreciate fantastic food opportunities, the opportunity to share in this wonderful dining experience.  I would NOT want anyone to hold out on me, after all.   If you are fortunate enough to get a spot at Wolfgang Puck's table at this location (this is the brainchild of David Robins) [HINT:  make a reservation] you will be treated to a three course special meal, totally at the discretion of the Chef for $25 including a glass of WP wine plus tip!  On top of this, on the second Tuesday of every month this location offers (generous) free samples of spectacular wine from around the world to all diners in the restaurant plus they bring in an amazing singer with a vast repertoire on those Tuesdays.   So what do you get for that meager fare - $25?  First they start your off with an amuse bouche - i have had a crab cake, a tomato shooter, tomato basil soup, the whole gambit. Then you get what the Italians would call a secondo piatti, i have had pappardella with a meat sauce that was sublime -- among many others.  Then the \"peaches of resistance,\" comes -- Chef Chris likes to bring this dish out personally in a tajine for the element of surprise -- the three most memorable dishes were two fish dishes, one salmon and another bass and the most amazing was shrimp on a skewer in a curry coconut sauce -- it was so beautiful. They take a real farm-to-table approach with their food -- everything is fresh and tasty and cooked to perfection.  For dessert lovers, they have the most amazing pastry chef that makes some of the best -- homemade chocolate pudding, strawberry shortcake, and the most amazing white chocolate cake with raspberry sorbet!  Again, i hesitate to share this because i ALWAYS WANT my spot at the table.  However, i would be derelict in my duties as a foodie if i did not tell a few others about this amazing feast for a small price for some of the best food in Las Vegas.  You owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this amazing opportunity soon -- i don't know how long this will last, but while it does -- Go FOR IT! PS they also do the most amazing ribs on the weekend that are, as they say, \"to die for.\"",

My boyfriend and I come every other week and so - sometimes we sit at the kitchen table, there is really great energy watching the chef and cooks making the food and bantering back and forth. Overall the food is amazing- the Chinese chicken salad and Prosciutto Pizza are \"MUST HAVE\" dishes. I would also add the Truffle Potato chips are to die for, but an infrequent guilty pleasure. My boyfriend and I got seated with the server James our first time and really such a nice guy and great service... we request him every time and we started picking up his historical mantra \"I'm killing it\" around the house. Automatically when we come in he knows what we want or will suggest good specials. One night my boyfriend and I came to Wolfgang feeling kinda down from a long day and we left feeling uplifted with huge smiles on our faces, thanks to James! The whole staff is super nice and the food comes quick. So happy to speak on both of our behalf that Wolfgang has become a family ritual.",

    "text": "Nestled in beautiful downtown Summerlin, we had a great relaxing dinner here. The menu was great and easy to navigate. It is classic American style food here.   FOOD: Delicious! Very rich flavors and everything tasted fresh. We had a Caprese salad to start and that was so refreshing and light. It was the perfect starter to our dinner. Our main courses were equally as good and very filling. I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with wild mushrooms, sauteed spinach and it was soooo good. Tasted so fresh and was just the right amount.   AMBIANCE: Very dim in there during happy hour. As it gets darker, they'll turn up the lighting of course. It looks somewhat rustic but very trendy and hip.   SERVICE: Excellent service! Our waiter Alex was very pleasant. Our food came very quickly.   DRESS CODE: Casual",

To start off, our server brought us water, but after that, we didn't have anyone come to our table for 15-20 minutes. We finally ordered our bottomless mimosas. It took a while to get our mimosas and we ordered calamari to start and spaghetti and meatballs and chicken Alfredo for our entrees. We got the calamari and it was super bland and under seasoned. My spaghetti was okay and my boyfriend's chicken Alfredo was also super bland.   Once we paid, we saw our server leave but expected to still be served mimosas. We thought wrong. We had empty glasses for a good 20 minutes. I finally flagged down a busser and asked for more mimosas. 5 minutes later, he brings the group of girls seated across from us two carafes of mimosas. We waited 10 more minutes and saw the busser continue cleaning. I had to ask the bartender for more drinks and we finally received 2 glasses.   Overall, the food was overpriced and pretty bland and the service was lacking. What a disappointment.",

Horrible customer service.  I also asked if I could get fried chicken on my Caesar salad and they said no.    The place also does not run air conditioning during the day it was so hot in there that maybe were requesting to change tables away from the windows.    I will not go back, I would have been better off going to shake shack next door instead if of wasting $100 at this place. It sucks.",

The striped bass was dry and just not good.   Worst food I've had for a while.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, well, ain't fooling me twice!",

It was about 105 degs outside, and we had no desire to enjoy the hot air wafting in from the door, so we asked to move.  They were very nice about it, and moved our waters and effects to a new table.  We ordered apps: Meatballs, Chicken Nachos, and Shrimp Scampi.  All were delicious, with nice sized portions.  We then went with entrees; Brick Chicken, Salmon Bowl, Fish Tacos, and a burger.  All were well prepared and tasty.  The service was excellent, with refills coming often and plates cleared rapidly.  They lost a star because they are a bit overpriced.  I realize it is a Puck establishment, but $28 for half a small baked chicken?  Overall; nice place to eat, but bring your wallet.",

    "text": "What a difference a year and a half makes. And not a good difference. I think it's time for an update.  Change is constant, and usually it's not for the better. That's certainly True in this case. Since my first review, I've been back to Wolfgang Puck at this location several times, sometimes for Happy Hour, sometimes not. But since my last visit, lots of things have disappeared - the extended HH hours, the discount for locals, but most important, the items on the menu that made us keep coming back.  Gone is the fabulous burger. Also gone is the salad with goat cheese. The HH menu is a shell of its former self. White wine? Choice of one, Chardonnay. Not my fave, but I know I'm an outlier. Beer at $5 isn't bad, until you see the size.  DH had the meatballs, two balls for $9, with sauce. I don't like the taste of pork in meatballs, so we didn't share. I had a hard time finding something to eat, and finally decided on Cheese Curds, which our waitress pronounced as \"delicious.\" I've had better, and I paid for all that fried and salty goo-meal for the rest of the night. If you go to the website and try to find any of the menus for this place, it'll lead you down a rabbit hole. Well hidden, and apparently not current enough. Those cheese curds aren't there. Unless they removed them since yesterday.  I did check the regular menu, but pretty much stopped at the Crab Cake appetizer when I saw it was $19. And that's just an appetizer. Oh, and that elusive hamburger was there, too, for $17. Okay, it's Angus beef. But should you want to substitute a lowly veggie burger, it'll cost an extra buck. WTF???  I used to love this place. But with prices escalating to near-Strip levels, I think I'll stick with more interesting ethnic restaurants.",

First off, I love anywhere that offers 4-7 pm HHs since I usually get done with work around 6. This place is beautiful inside, very modern and classy. The location is always easy to get to (right across from Shake Shack).   We decided to order basically everything on the HH menu and then some. Drink wise, the molecule mules were great and super cheap! For food my favorites were the salmon tartar tacos, chips & onion dip, and the truffle chips. The wings were alright, but needed a bit more sauce and I wasn't a huge fan of the buffalo  cauliflower (my personal taste). We also had some cookies and carrot cake for desserts. Both were very sweet & delicious.  I highly recommend this place for a tasty & cute HH. I'll have to come back another time for dinner or brunch.",

Our (Small $25.00) smoked salmon dill cream and black caviar pizza was delicious. Shrimp Ceviche ($15.00) not tasty at all (we left it on the table). Our Mac n Cheese never made it to the table regrettably, and the Hockey Puck dessert was terrible.Dessert was removed from the bill as a good will gesture (or probably because our server forgot the mac n cheese) and I appreciated the courtesy.

My parents were visiting and I live here but I don't eat out that often.  Give we love wolfgang, we thought we'd give this a try.  First I need to start off by saying our server was 5 stars.  She was amazing and I wish that I had remembered her name, for sure our experience was better because of her.  As far as the food, we ordered a lot.  To start we shared the truffle potato chips and corned beef hash.  Both were delicious and those potato chips truly something special.  For our entrees we had the Baja fish tacos, eggs benedict, burger, and avocado toast.  The highlights were for sure the fish tacos and the eggs Benedict, the avocado toast was very good but the tacos fell short.  They were very under seasoned and underwhelming for the most popular dish as our server said.  Nothing here was incredibly innovate or insanely good but everything here was solid.  We would come back here in a heartbeat and this is a great spot to bring someone who isn't easily pleased.  There seems to be something for everyone here.",

I really like the fact that they hold events such as Sommerlier competitions with wine pairing dinners and beer dinners as well and for that I will keep coming back. It's creative and fun! The service has also always been good and that is always important. I recently attended the Clambake event paired with Sierra Nevada Brewery. It was really fun but I must admit it felt a little disorganized bc no one seemed to know what was being served where. Maybe a few signs would've helped. There were a lot of long lines in certain stations and it seemed hard for the food to keep up. Shucking oysters was one of the long lines and I wanna send a shout out to the shuckers bc they were good sports with good attitudes. Thank you for holding these events!",

    "text": "*** Review is for Restaurant Week 2018 menu ***  Even though Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill has been in the neighborhood for almost three years, this was my first time eating here.  I looked at the RW menu and decided this would be a good way to test the food and service.  This was a $40 RW menu.  For the three courses, I chose the Baja shrimp ceviche with tostada crisps.  The ceviche had red pepper in it and on the rim of the glass.  There were pieces of avocado on the top of the ceviche.  After eating most of the ceviche, I lifted the glass and drank the remaining juices and got some good pepper taste.  The main I chose was the black pepper pappardelle with wild boar ragu and pecorino cheese.  The runner asked if I wanted pepper or parmesan and I asked for parmesan.  He came back with a small contained with freshly shredded cheese that I added to the pappardelle.  For dessert, I ordered the salted caramel pretzel tart.    The main course was the star of the dinner.  The ceviche was good but the glass was so packed it made it a bit difficult to eat.  I know I have some tomato to make sure is removed from my shirt when I do laundry.  The pretzel tart was OK but I expected more pretzel.  There were bits of pretzel sprinkled on top of the caramel tart and alongside the piece but that was it.   Service was excellent.",

Not a ton of high quality places to eat in DTS so Wolfgang Puck is always a good option. Their beer selection is amazing for people looking for local beers.   Bonus points for VGK-themed dishes!!

Decided to sit at the bar and the bartender and other wait staff are a hopping fulfilling orders for waiting patrons. The bartender took my order and brought me a menu over. She was very pleasant and friendly. I have never visited a bar where the bartender comes to the tables in the bar area and floats around. I am so glad she is able to do this since it makes her job easier, fun, and more involved in the customer experience.   The heartbeat of the bar is the bartender and the individual that is running this place is highly organized and very focused. She recommended the buffalo cauliflower which was fantastically hot but the burn goes away after a bit. I had a glass of rose to start but then with buffalo anything beer is the answer. To pair with the rest of the buffalo cauliflower decided on the beer flavored Sierra Nevada Hazy Little Thing.   The ambiance of the restaurant/bar was so relaxing but still upscale enough to keep up the elegance of fine dining. The wood paneling is a great touch and so is the outside patio area which has a mist system. This being the desert with a great way to stay cool and proper shading the outside patio area is welcoming too, but I prefer good old air conditioning and cocktails indoors.",

    "text": "This is not your typical Wolfgang Puck experience. I came to this location thinking the experience would be similar to the Caesar's Palace location...that is DEFINITELY not the case...  This review is based on my Mother's Day late time lunch. We had reservations for 3 PM but were able to get in at 130 with only a 10 minute wait. It was super loud when we got inside the dining area. My infant didn't like it at first. The menu was very basic -- was actually shocked for something that had Wolfgang's name on it. My husband I ordered the Korean Wings, Mezze Sampler, WP Burger, and Aviator Pizza. (Side note: We went to the game for a bit before we dined and there was a special for a free pizza with same day game ticket.) The waitress was very friendly and attentive with making sure my husband always had a full glass of soda. What really irked me was that our food was delivered through \"auctioning off.\" For the prices of the food and the name associated with this establishment, I would think that the service would be top notch. I'd honestly get the same service dining at IHOP. The food was nothing special. My husband and I thought the pita bread used for the sampler was the same as the pizza dough. The wings were okay, nothing special. The burger was pretty good --very juicy and flavorful. Pizza was subpar -- lacked cheese and diverse array of flavor. The sampler was the best item we ate.   Overall, I will not return to this place. A warning sign should have been the words \"Bar and Grill.\"",

    "text": "This is a happy hour review.   The Skinny: overpriced portions for happy hour review and with the exception of the calamari wouldn't order anything else again(3), service: pretty good in the bar area (4), value: pass -  there are better places to spend your hard earned cash (3).  After purchasing some Wolfgang Puck gift cards from Costco (protip: $100 gift card for $79.99 - this is an online deal only), we still had some money leftover from a visit to Spago. So we decided to hit this place for happy hour and use up the rest of it.   The happy hour food menu consists of truffled potato chips with Maytag blue cheese fondue, cheese plate,  charcuterie plate, chicken wings,  fried calamari,  meatballs,  and pork tacos -  each dish is priced at $6.  We placed an order for the chicken wings, the calamari,  the meatballs, and the pork tacos. The hubs raised an eyebrow but I told him I didn't think the portion sizes were going to be big.   Boy was I right! We spent $24 on 2 small meatballs, 4 chicken wings, 2 bite sized tacos and calamari that I could probably fit in 1 cupped hand.  But are the prices worth it? The magic 8 ball says no.   The meatballs were okay but the marinara was overly sweet. The pork tacos didn't have that robust porkiness and was relatively bland even with the salsa. The chicken wings were nothing no to write home about and the mild Asian hot sauce didn't really distinguish itself in any particular way.   The best thing was by far the calamari. The batter was perfect and light. We loved the green ginger flavored aioli it came with.   Service was excellent with a full bar area and our water glasses were never empty.   Given what we sampled today, I would be hard pressed to return. The portion sizes for the price/quality is pretty ridiculous. 3 starred review.",

The fries were steak fries that seemed unseasoned. The Mac & cheese was terrible. The pasta used was super thick and the cheese, like the rest of the food, was flavorless. My husband got the Margherita pizza and Caesar salad. He also hated it. The Caesar salad was boring and the pizza was oily. Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed. There's nothing we hate more than paying for food that we didn't enjoy. There are plenty of restaurants in the area, we'll go somewhere else next time.",

I used an outside delivery service to order for myself and coworker and when our food arrived we both had small cartons of a simple salad with cashews and wonton crisps along with a container of one chicken breast in it. We both paid the additional $9 each for chicken to accompany our salads and we both ate feeling under satisfied after having to split the one piece we received.   I realize there are a few extra dollars that accompany a world renowned Chef's restaurant, but I am baffled I that I just paid that much money for what seemed to be simple side salad. On the other hand the chicken was cooked perfectly and was full of flavor.",

The entire restaurant was empty with only 3 other sets of patrons already there.  We waited awkwardly for a while for a host or someone to  seat us.  There was no one in sight and no one even acknowledged that we were standing there waiting. It seemed the staff just wanted us to turn around and leave so they can finish cleaning and go home.   After we were seated, things seemed to be okay after that awkward moment at the door.  Juan R. served us and he was a good server and made us feel comfortable.  I think he was the only server there with two other tables full of people.  The food, drinks and ambience was great! We enjoyed every dish we ordered and would not hesitate to go back for the food, but I think once is enough and there's other places that seemed more alive and inviting that we will consider next time when we are doing a late Friday night dinner.",

    "text": "The menu may not be groundbreaking, but the execution has been excellent almost every visit. Add to that a dark, comfortable dining area with views into an open kitchen and you've got a spot that has gained much popularity since opening in the new Downtown Summerlin shopping district.  Like other Wolfgang spots around town, you'll find pizzas. The Asian BBQ chicken pizza ($14) lacked enough hoisin to give it a distinct Asian flavor, but the chicken, broccoli, chiles and cilantro still made it a satisfying dish. I preferred the potato leek pizza ($12) with its sweet garlic, goat cheese and guanciale toppings. The chewy crust on both showed an ample amount of char and blisters and delivered some great flavors.  There are a handful of pasta dishes on the menu. The hand-crafted rags of pasta that make up the garganelli ($15) were impressive. The turkey bolognese sauce added much savoriness while the basil whipped ricotta added a touch of sweetness.  Among entrees simplicity seems to be the concept behind every dish. The sea bass ($34) looks like a minimally plated dish but is expertly seasoned and roasted, sitting atop a gremolata and garlic spinach. Equally bare is a tender, lean grilled New York strip ($37) topped with an herb butter coating its well charred exterior and accompanied by a handful of skinny fries. Their mesquite grilled burger ($12) won't win any awards for originality, but it's a well crafted combination of aged cheddar, red onion marmalade, and bacon aioli atop a patty larger than the bun it's in.  For dessert the bread pudding ($9) and molten chocolate cake ($9) are tried and True dishes that will satisfy your need for a sugar fix. Their best option is a flaky and buttery apple crostada ($8) with caramel and vanilla gelato.  The familiar fare may not push culinary boundaries, but it should play well to the Summerlin crowd. There are plenty of dishes that are approachable yet elevated when compared to similar spots on this side of town. The \"something for everyone\" approach is great for local families and folks who don't consider themselves \"foodies\" yet still has enough well crafted plates to satisfy more sophisticated palates.",

    "text": "It is nice to have a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in Downtown Summerlin! I have a couple favorites on Wolfgang's menu that had me driving to the strip locations for years.  This restaurant has an nice contemporary but cabin feel with their large wooden doors, wood interior, brown placemats and hand blown water glasses. This is an upscale indoor/outdoor dining restaurant with room for social events. But, you don't want to be sitting in the seating adjacent to the social event room during an event. It has sliders that do not buffer the noise. Trust me, I know.  Since they opened, I have probably patronized the restaurant five-six times as recently as yesterday for lunch. My favorite salad is Wolfgang's classic Chinois salad. Recently, Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill has reverted to calling it simply the Chinese Chicken Salad. Apparently, the word \"Chinois\" was too complicated to say for our diverse population. My teenage son really enjoys having the mesquite-grilled burger with fries. He says the meat is juicy and flavorful while the bun doesn't get soggy during the meal. I usually steal some of his delicious fries - they are super good.  One thing that set's this restaurant aside besides the atmosphere is the creative extra touches. I really enjoy having iced tea at this restaurant because of the flavor and cool iced tea cubes instead of just ice chips or ice cubes. Also, the menu is not overwhelming and changes by the month/season. They use fresh vegetables and fruits from the local Summerlin Farmer's Market wherever possible.   My only disappointment would be the fresh blackberry cobbler. Although it has a great flavor, it is too thin and the crust is more like a crumb topping. If you like vanilla ice-cream on your cobbler, it quickly overwhelms the portion of cobbler.  I have had some amazing cobblers over the years - even by Wolfgang and this was not the one!  The customer service has always been awesome, and I do enjoy this restaurant. I look forward to tasting more creations at this location in the upcoming months and years.",

    "text": "With the opening of Downtown Summerlin, we were happy to see a Wolfgang Puck's on the list of restaurants.  My wife and I when Puck's first opened and enjoyed it enough that we've been back several times.  It definitely has a casual bar and grill feel, and they've set it up to make everyone comfortable regardless of dress.  We've seen jeans and t-shirts at one table, and business attire just a few tables away.  Even so, the fine dining quality found at other Wolfgang Puck's restaurants isn't lost here.  You're treated very well by the wait staff and the food is prepared and served in a manner that makes you think they're cooking just for you.  Recommendations:  if it's lunchtime, try one of the salads or the Italian Sausage or Roasted Vegetable pizza.  At dinner, come hungry and try any of the pastas to start followed by the Scottish Salmon or the Garlic and Herb Chicken.  Or if you're in a burger mood, the Mesquite Grilled Burger won't disappoint.  (I've had fish there twice now and both times it was perfectly cooked.)  Always be sure to ask about the daily specials too.  If you like Wolfgang Puck's, keep in mind they have a room for private dining as well.  You'll need to reserve it in advance.  They also cater.  With Downtown Summerlin being so accessible off the 215, drive over and enjoy a stroll through the shops.  When you're ready for a meal or just want to sit and enjoy a drink at the bar, consider Wolfgang Puck's.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

The serving sizes are large enough you won't leave starving but will not stuff you. For dessert we shared an apple pastry. The crust was fluffy and the apples were sweet without being over powering.

    "text": "Mixed review at dinner tonight.  I saw that they offered a Sunday Supper for $25 per person. I asked what the supper menu looked like and it sounded like something the family would like.  It's a great bargain with delicious food.  However portions don't work for  family.  I'd rather pay more and be satisfied.  Their Sunday supper is for a minimum of family of 4.  We have five in our family...which they charged for 5 but gave us  portions for 4.    Apps:  Calamari, margharita pizza, and tomato & burrata salad.  All very tasty.  One small pizza for the table is basically one small slice per person.  Calamari was delicious, but again not enough for five people.   Entree:  Rotisserie chicken, rigatoni pasta, and flat iron steak.  The steak was pre-sliced and ended up serving 1 small slice per person.  The small pasta dish was empty within minutes.  The chicken portion was healthy.  Sides:  Broccollini and Roasted Potatoes.  Good portions and tasty.  Dessert:  Red velvet cake and cherry cobbler.  Two regular dessert portions for five people.  My wife and I didn't even get a taste of the cake as we split it up for our kids.  Everything we had was delicious.  Portions were pretty ridiculously small.    Our server was very sweet and we mentioned it to her.  She talked to the kitchen and brought out another serving of the pasta.  We also ordered another pizza for the table.    It's a great value with good food.  Portions are way too small.  Mind you...we had two adults and three kids (14, 11, 6).   Five adults would be famished after this meal.     I would rather pay $35 per person and have an adequate amount of food.  To add insult to injury, our server told me that my credit card was declined.  When I called Wells Fargo, they said that the restaurant tried to charge the card incorrectly so it triggered a fraud alert.  Very disappointed with dinner...despite the excellent flavors.",

The burger is fantastic and the pastas are all made in-house! Sure the seating arrangements are strange, get a table...not a low boy or one of the bar tables. Managers are accommodating and service is great. It's one of the best places to dine in Summerlin!!",

So, we were forced to divide our group to sit at two separate tables in the side room by ourselves?  The service was not very good for having two servers they struggled with simple drink service.  The only food I heard anyone say was really good was the pasta carbonara.  The special salmon burgers were dry with little dressing and big portion of sweet potato fries that came with ketchup.  Overall, I have experienced better and simply would not return as there are many other dining options in area.",

While the staff were pleasant, they seemed to keep forgetting items we asked for such as an extra napkin to clean a wine spill that they made while pouring and left on our table to clean up.  Dropped an appetizer with no side plates and had to get up to go find someone for plates... just silly things, bit we felt more like a nuisance than a guest.

Waiter came back and told me that it would be an extra 9 dollars to add the two so I declined considering the burger is only 12 dollars. Asked for a menu to change my order and nothing else seemed all that great. That's when I decided to leave. Asked the waiter if I needed to pay for the untouched water and Arnold Palmer I ordered and he had the manager come over to speak with me. The manager explained that the reason for the high price is because they use a wild mushroom. He kept saying he didn't want me to feel as though I was being cheated. I felt fine until the waiter brought over a ten dollar check for the water and Arnold Palmer. I asked the manager as he passed by why I was being charged and he laughed and said he'd handle it. Absolutely terrible customer service from the very manager. Never will I ever eat here nor shall I suggest anyone come here. Save you money and eat anywhere else.",

We got the margarita pizza and the macaroni and cheese. The pizza was sooo delicious. We got the smaller size and split it which was perfect for 2 people (3 small slices per person) The macaroni was good, but not the best I've ever had. I was celebrating my birthday here, so we got a slice of key lime pie with a candle. I don't like key lime pie (personal preference) so I don't really know if it was good or bad, but my friend enjoyed it. The only problem with my meal was my waitress. Our waitress never asked for our order or greeted us after waiting about 10-15 mins, so we asked another server if they could get our order and he did and was so friendly and pleasant. The food was good, but my waitress in particular was eh. (The rest of the staff was great)",

We thought this would be a consistent place to go to.... Wrong!  ordered beer, out of stockordered different beer, out of stock, ordered a pina colada, brought me one on the rocks because the blender was broken, ordered pepperoni pizza, smelled and tasted like beer; I had someone else smell and try it just for confirmation and just like I said, smelled and tasted like beer! other than our server who was great  I didn't go to Wolfgang Puck's and spend $$$ for poor quality.",

The burger was huge with delicious grilled onions and plenty of melty cheese. I couldn't even finishj it with the side of mac (decent). I got the rigatoni with turkey Bolognese  to go and despite not usually being a pasta fan unless its mac n cheese or Alfredo I actually think I liked this one better. Overall it's not a bad place and If go be k if in the red rock area.",

We had a salad with vinaigrette. That was okay. Didn't have much flavor to it. Then had the fish and chips. The fish was not good. It fell apart so quickly. It was soggy and there was no crisp at all to the batter/breading.   Save your money and go elsewhere for better fish and chips.",

We came on a typical Sunday and sat outside. Staff was awesome and food was very good. At our table we roared a Benedict, avocado toast, regular burger, and turkey burger. Burgers were ready and wee full  meals. Avocado toast came with just one piece of toast.  It was very good but could be made at home for sure; nothing spectacular. The Benedict was just the eggs and muffins, no potatoes as a side even, which was disappointing. Very tasty but small. The dish was great but a side is a necessity.   All in all, the mimosa service was the best I've ever had. The glass was always full and the waiter didn't judge.  Unfortunately it was only orange juice in the mimosa, but I still enjoyed it. Wolfgangs is very solid and worth a go if you're looking for a relaxing way to do a Sunday.",

    "text": "The good - Bloody Mary was excellent, Desserts were very good, burgers good   The bad - we had a group of 9 for a birthday event, reservations made 2 weekus prior to visit based on the menu that was online up until today.  Got down, sat and looked at the menu and it was pared down greatly.  All of us had looked at the menu in advance, knew what they were interested in and were disappointed that it wasn't available.     Since we were 9, with gifts, it was difficult to choose to leave to go elsewhere although it was contemplated.     Lots of what I had wanted was available at Happy Hour, but that wasn't until 3 and we were there at 1.  No notification of the change until we all sat down and looked at the menu.  Hmm they had my phone #...we picked the restaurant due to the diverse items on the menu...well that diversity was gone.   Waiter was good but stretched thin since he was also working outside.  Normally our group  has at least 2 or 3 beverages each, only had 1 due to inattentiveness to our party.  Took a long time to get the drinks, and, when ordering apps, had to ask for plates for sharing, had to ask for salt and pepper.  The caprese wasn't what was expected, which was ok but the tomatoes had the roots in it, too much radiccio in the Chinese chicken salad so it made it bitter tasting.     We made them aware of our disappointment and the waiter tried to appease and was going to get the manager....he came back out, said we'll give you 20% off.  It was nice but still we didn't see the manager.    Our brunch ended with 3 free desserts for our birthdays (there were 2 of us celebrating) which was a surprise and well received but again, no plates to share so it was truly 'family style'.   I almost didn't write this due to the desserts and no sign of the manager.    We expected more in service and variety for the price we paid and were very disappointed.  With many places to choose from in Downtown Summerlin we wanted to try someplace new based on the menu that was published prior to today.   Sad, that they didn't think enough of a group of people, who made a reservation, to let them know of the drastic change.   And it was  interesting that it wasn't that busy when we were there but at 3 pm when the menu had the variety I was looking for - wings, chicken nachos, it got really busy.     We will not be back....but do appreciate the discount and desserts and tipped the waiter based on the service not based on the management decision.   He tried, management should have presented themselves.  I wouldn't patronize this establishment again.  I was going to give it 2 stars due to the desserts and discount but a place with the Wolfgang Puck name should have done better.",

    "text": "Traveling through Las Vegas, we made a planned stop in Summerlin to try out the new Wolfgang Puck bar and Grill and we were so glad that we did!!  From the decor to the service to the quality and taste of the food, everything far surpassed any expectations.  We started out with the grilled octopus, the tuna tartar and the beet salad.  The tuna tartar was exceptional.  I usually don't like beets but this salad may have changed my mind.  It was amazing!  I had a whiskey sour as a little treat and it was delicious - definitely not just something thrown together with sour mix (which I hate).  My friends ordered the Chinese Chicken salad and the burger - both of which they said were thoroughly satisfying and tasty.  I ordered the rigatoni with turkey sausage bolognese which may have changed my life.  It was easily one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  I wanted to take a picture of it but I realized that I ate almost all of it by the time the thought even occurred to me.  Both of my friends were in complete agreement after trying a few (as many as they could steal) bites of my dish.  We decided to splurge and ordered a few desserts - chocolate lava cake, pineapple upside down cake, and creme brulee.  We definitely went overboard but we were celebrating so we decided to just go for it.  Everything was amazing, not that we were surprised.  I don't even think we could pick a favorite, it was all so good.  They pair the pineapple upside down cake with pineapple sorbet which was such a delicious combo.  All in all, the meal was amazing.  We will definitely come back and may even plan another trip through vegas just so we can stop off here and eat until we are stuffed again.",

I had the red sangria, which was good--a tiny bit too sweet--but not so sweet to stop me from drinking three of them over the course of dinner. My boyfriend and I split the calamari for an appetizer, and it was good. I don't remember it too specifically now, so it definitely wasn't the best I've ever had, but I remember thinking it was good at the time.   For an entree, I had the spaghetti and meatballs. So good. So so so so tasty. The sauce was perfect and there was just the right amount to balance the flavor of the pasta and the meatballs. Two of our dinner companions also had pasta dishes, and they were part of the clean plate club that night. My boyfriend had steak frites. I stole a french fry, and it was crispy, well-seasoned, and hot, as it should be.   I gave it four stars instead of five because the service was good, but not great. Make a reservation if you go because all of Summerlin has found this place!",

The wine selection was very good and the food choices were predictably top shelf. Some complain about the portion sizes being small, but they were decent and not the spot of food in the middle of a large plate you often come across.",

It was a busy Friday night and the restaurant seemed overcrowded...it was very loud, like difficult to hold a conversation (and we were in the back cot era)...great bustling atmosphere but not great for conversation. Service was a little slow--they seemed overwhelmed by the crowd...But water and drinks were refilled quickly.  We decided to try several things. We both got the chopped salad with champagne vinagrette...amazing! It is enough for two to share, or add chicken for an entree. We will go back specifically for that salad!   We had the cheese plate as well- unimpressive and overpriced. Do not recommend.  Instead of doing main courses, we ordered two sides to go with our salads. Mac and cheese is to die for...we loved it. We also got the broccoli I which was nicely seasoned with garlic and chilis...  Overall, great spot for a nice lunch or casual dinner...however, if you are looking for a more intimate, fine dining experience I would go somewhere else.  We will be back!",

I thought since this restaurant had Wolfgang pucks name on the sign I was going experience something special. I felt like I paid a premium for a fancy name on the building and was scammed with mediocre food and high bill. Wolfgang Puck should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant. The name has lost value with my dinning experience here. If you dine here don't expect anything better then mediocre food with a dive bar dining experience at a high cost.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place with my boyfriend for an early dinner. Upon entering the interior decor was rustic with an open kitchen. I seriously wanted to love this place so much. Everything was going so well, decor was gorgeous, appetizer was an amazing start, and attention to our drinks were on point. It was great until I received my pasta. The waiter set the dish in front of me and I'm thinking, wow this is going to be so good. My boyfriend stole the first bite of my pasta which is so typical of him. Anyways, he told me that the pasta was undercooked! I said no... This is Wolfgang's restaurant this can not happen. So I took a bite out of the pasta and you can definitely tell it was undercooked. It was basically raw in the middle. I know you probably think, \"Oh no, it's called al dente.\" NO! It was freaking raw. So, I told my server that the pasta was underdone and she had the audacity to say oh no we definitely cook our pasta al dente. Homegirl! No that sh*t is not. She told me that they can definitely take it back and cook it a little bit more for me. Ughhh seriously don't treat me like I'm stupid and picky. I've eaten so much pasta in my lifetime to know what is al dente and rock hard. So my server takes the dish back and I see the cooks in the back looking smug and annoyed because they have to redo a dish. At this point I'm just over it. I tried liking this place but that little comment just annoyed so much that I can't even. Whatever. Food would have tasted a lot better if they cooked it right the first time. My boyfriend's burger wasn't even impressive either, just salty. At the end, we paid for an okay meal that had high hopes but fell short due to execution and service. Lesson learned kids, not all places with a celebrity chef's name on it is going to be great.",

The design is open and airy and with lots of natural light and a great outdoor dining area. The food we had was wonderful w/ excellent salads, martini's (when they finally arrived), trout cooked perfectly and a \"steak frites\" w/ a decadent herb butter topping - but the wait service...terrible.  Slow in greeting the table, took forever to get cocktails, sloppy presentation of the food when it came out - and all of this in an empty restaurant. My guess is it's a management issue...who knows, but for a higher end restaurant you expect more.",

They tried to put people next to us and they kept insisting to sit someone else. To start to ordered calamari which was good but very small. A minestrone soup. The broth was good but it seemed like everything else was undercooked. I got the pepperoni pizza and my wife got the steak frittes. She ordered mac n cheese on the side and i got a side of fries w my pizza. I think the bill was over 130 bux. Im not sure what kind of steak it was, it was cut then bad some fries on the side for 35 bux. The fries were good but mcdonalds r the same. The only thing worth getting here was the pizza. Overall, biggest rip off in the world. Worst seating arrangement in the world. Please save ur money. Have the pix u see on yelp do not exist there anymore as they keep changing their menu. Do urself a favor and just get a take out pizza, go home and eat it. Place is just foul",

The chips and salsa on happy hour is amazing, it taste very fresh. All the food we tried here (Margarita Pizza, Spaghetti and Meatballs, Caesars salad and Mixed Salad) were great. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that we would not have to ask to get bread and butter before. Now, if you do ask, they certainly we'll bring it to your table, however they don't just offer it by themselves. The chicken wings on happy hour are very very good (twice baked), but for $6 Dollars I think you should get a little more that the 4 they serve you.",

I think if I went again: it would be for a cocktail and not if I was hungry.   All of my friends food looked great (presentation)  however;  no one was raving about their meals.    I had the caesar salad and asked for chicken.  It was super bland.  I actually was thinking maybe they forgot the dressing.   I added my friend's dill dressing on my salad hoping it would make it better.   Another friend had the chicken salad sandwich which was a lunch special and said it was pretty good.   Another had a steak salad which was also a lunch special.  Another had a burger and fries.  (The skinny fries were very good).   This place is still new but it was no comparison to a SPAGO (also a Wolfgang Puck restaurant).  Anyway, the bill was $104. We left a $20 tip so that's basically $24 a person for lunch.   Seems a little pricey to me for what you get/got.   I'd rather go to Red Robin and pay half the price and walk out \"full\" and satisfied.   Too bad they can't get those other restaurants open at Downtown Summerlin.  I mean, really, the mall opened Oct 9.",

After being seated our waitress came, she didn't introduce herself but was very knowledgeable about the food when we had questions, she even made recommendations of drinks. I thought the lighting was a bit dark for me, for a large table I thought it should of been brighter like the smaller party that sat next to us that had better lighting. I thought we would receive some bread while we waited for our salads and soups to come out but we didn't. I was facing the kitchen so I was able to see the line. I thought it was weird seeing someone who wasn't in uniform come on line and eat food in front of the customers. Even though it wasn't that busy, I think it was a bit rude. Our food came out and it looked and tasted delicious. I had the chopped salad and thought it was a good portion. I tried the clam chowder and it was pretty good but felt a bit loose? But that's just me. We also got the calamari, which I wish had a bit more calamari. The sauces that came with it went well with it. I thought half of it was a bit salty. There was even a fried lemon and was something different. The wait staff was great, our waters were always filled  and they took our finished plates right away. Our main course came out and it looked and tasted delicious. I had the oxtail pasta, which i forgot the actually name was one of the best pastas I've ever tasted. From the fresh pasta which I've seen them made to the bolanaise oxtail sauce. Would highly recommend. My friend, who had here bday here got the roasted vegetable pizza was pretty good, I actually had a slice and dipped it in the bolanaise sauce. Tasted even better and had her doing the same. After we were finished our waitress noticed it was my friend's bday and brought out a bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream. I love the crunchy top to the bread pudding. Overall our experience was great, especially the wait staff.",

Our waitress was friendly & tolerant of our questions & requests (we've all been that customer!) & always smiled. We ordered the chicken salad sandwich with the bread not toasted, the steak salad & the mac & cheese. Our food took a while & my partner in crime was getting agitated... but then it came &, upon the 1st bite of mac & cheese, all was forgiven. It was the mac & cheese that dreams are made of. Literally perfection. The chicken salad sandwich was both savory & sweet... also amazing. The only critique was that the bread was almost too hearty/tough. Otherwise, what was referred to as a \"special\" should be permanent! The flank steak in the salad, even well done, was succulent. The salad was delicious but the dressing wasn't creamy/thick enough to hold up to the salad's substance (even asking for extra dressing didn't help). It was a very pleasant experience that we're looking forward to immersing ourselves in again.",

    "text": "My husband and I went for lunch today (Sunday at 1:00) to celebrate his birthday and our wedding anniversary.  We waited close to an hour for our food, and in spite of apologies from the waiter, and the excuse that my husbands chicken didn't \"look right\" and they had to prepare a fresh one, no attempt was made to offer an appetizer or even some bread to hold us over.  The place was packed with staff, yet our waters went empty until we asked for refills.  My husbands 1/2 chicken finally arrived, and for $20.00 I don't think it would kill them to put a few vegetables on the plate.  It was a scrawny (free range apparently) semi dry chicken with three sprigs of dried out rosemary sticking out of it.  The side of mac a cheese (that we had to pay extra for) was also dried out.  My wild mushroom pasta was good.  Lots of mushrooms and al dente, so that might have been worth the $18.00, but for the prices they charge, vegetables, potatoes, a salad, or rice should come with the entree, and if they're going to take an hour to give people their food, some bread would prevent patrons from knawing off a table leg.  The atmosphere was active and noisy, so the \"edgy\" music they played was just more noise that wasn't needed.  This particular Pucks is new and in the heart of downtown Summerlin Las Vegas.  This is an upscale area where restaurants are frequented by mostly locals.  We have countless wonderful restaurants at our fingertips, with ambiance, good service, decent portions, and tasty, reasonably priced menu items.  It appears to us that Wolfgang Pucks is counting on the name to carry the restaurant, and the overpriced, stingy portions and bad service will be overlooked.  That might fly on the strip, but it won't fly with the locals.  We will not be back.",
