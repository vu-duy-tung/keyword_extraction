Goat cheese croquettes were nice but nothing special.  The 7 oz skirt steak with chimichurri was excellent.  The waiter said the duck & waffle with egg was popular so we ordered it -- very pricey at $23.  It was definitely unique.  Skipped the brussel sprouts because they sounded like they would be sweet. The raw bar menu is very pricey.  The menu has some very interesting options but but at $18-24 for many items it will add up quickly. It's a casual atmosphere with an open concept.  They seem well suited for a happy hour area but it isn't set up yet.  Menu is certainly intriguing.  Just depends on your budget.  We wouldn't hesitate to return on our next visit and have a full dinner.",

    "text": "Date: March 2017  I have been to Vegas 6 times, all on business trips. This time I was on vacation and I was excited to try all the food Vegas had to offer.  Sugarcane has a daily happy hour menu which we decided to try. The place was empty, compared to the other restaurants around it, which is usually a sign to maybe consider another place but we ended-up giving them a try based on the reviews we read. We sat at the bar and from the happy hour menu we ordered a few cocktails, their bacon wrapped dates, salmon poke, and the brussels sprouts.  FOOD:  Bacon Wrapped Dates: The bartender highly recommended them and said that they are one of the most popular apps. I've had them before and personally like the sweet and salty combo. The bacon was so burnt that it literally crumbled and just tasted like burnt chalk. Needles to say we shared one bite and pushed it to the side and couldn't eat anymore.   Salmon Poke: The poke was not like the poke I know. The salmon sat in a pool of slimy juice. There was no vessel to eat it, like a cracker or chip, or anything. The texture was so unappetizing because it was so wet and slimy that I just couldn't eat another bite - so we pushed that aside.   Brussels Sprouts: We love roasted brussels sprouts. This app was okay, just very oily. We finished this plate - we were very hungry.   SERVICE:  Service was a bit slow to start but the food came out in a timely manner. When we asked the bartender for the check he asked if we wanted to wrap everything up. We said no. He asked why, which was a very positive move as not many servers will notice if people are unsatisfied. We told him we were not happy with the food, so he offered to take it off the bill, which was another positive move, but we insisted on paying for everything. We also gave him a larger tip simply because not may servers will care enough to notice if the customer is unsatisfied.   OVERALL: I always believe on giving a place a second chance. Since I don't live near Vegas, I probably would not take the chance.",

BLOG: If someone asked me what kind of restaurant this is,  I wouldn't be sure what to say, but I would say definitely go there. You'll have a good time over gold food. There's no theme to all the dishes - some Japanese-inspired dishes, some southern, some grilled - but everything we had was delicious. I would try recommend some dishes, but I've dined here over half a dozen times, trying different dishes every time and it never disappoint.   It's more of a bar but there's an area for a more regular dining experience. Good place to eat and have some drinks without getting overstuffed. You can have a seat at the tables for a regular dinner, but I'd recommend heading straight to the bar and seating yourself - the bar staff is BEYOND AMAZING. Especially G...if you see him working (normally is on the weekends), he'll make one of the best libations you've ever tasted. Whether he's recreating your favorite or recommending an inspiration on what you enjoy, his drinks are an experience in of itself. He puts on a show and takes his time. On top of that, he know what foods to pair with your drinks. Rare to see with a bartender, especially in Vegas . One of the biggest reasons I keep coming back.  Heading in for another Vegas weekend with no plans at all, but I know one place I'll be.",

But if pressed I'd have to say the two weakest  were the sweet potatoes and (shockingly) the scallops! Again neither of these were bad by annnny means but they just didn't hold ground like everything else that was insanely flavorful. And the scallops at a price rave of $22 just didn't seem worth it.  I'm sad I didn't get to do any of the raw stuff as I'm sure they specialize in it (being a raw bar afterall). Alas maybe next time Vegas ;)I",

    "text": "Hands down, my current favorite restaurant.   I have been obsessed with asian fusion for the last 2 years, and thankfully the rest of Vegas seems to be following suit because we have had quite a few pop up.   I first went here last year during restaurant week. (My friends dragged me here against my will.) They had a great restaurant week menu that gave a good overview of all their dishes at a great price. Since then I have been a faithful customer, trying new things each time.   The snapper ceviche, brussel sprouts, and pig ear pad thai are amazing and my favourites. I order them time and time again. The cocktails and desserts are also great. So unique and tasty.   And the staff is fantastic. Sometimes a bit slow, but very sweet. I once ordered something I didn't like too much. Our waiter offered to replace it with something else I liked, but I told him not to worry about it since we had already eaten half the dish. Lo and behold, he still brought out another dish, on the house, in hopes that we would like that one. It was very sweet and really speaks volumes of top notch customer service.",

We were told the food comes out of the kitchen fast.  Unfortunately for us it took longer because of short staffing.  We appreciated their honesty and they provided a discount for the late arrival of food and lack of service.  Food was amazing and fresh.  Hopefully we will return again and get better service.",

    "text": "Wow, this place hit it on all cylinders! My co-workers and I stopped in for dinner, as there was no wait for a table and the place across the hall had a 90 minute wait. After our meal at Sugarcane, we're really glad we stopped in!  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, as they're all served Tapas style. Not a bad dish in the whole lot! Seriously, it was all insanely delicious.  Salmon poke - spicy and fresh and great! Tuna tartare - served on a rice cracker with avocado puree and sesame seeds. The crunch of the rice cracker was a nice contrast. Hamachi crudo - mmmmm, buttery and tender with a little hint of serrano. Crispy smashed potatoes - not oily or overly salted - just a lot of good potato flavor with romesco sauce. Harissa beets - chunks of roasted beets in yogurt and harissa sauce with hazelnuts. Wow, we loved this one. Skirt steak - served with chimmichurri sauce (could have used a little more). very tender. Yellowtail collar - great rich flavor fish.  for dessert: Torrejas - dulce de leche french toast w/ apples and cinnamon ice cream. 3 spoons.   So good! There was not a morsel left on any plate.   The service was top notch from the moment we walked in. Their music was the perfect playlist of throwback 90s hip-hop, not too loud. The manager said he used his own playlist instead of the company's - so glad he did!   Plenty of cooked food here if you shy away from the word \"raw\", but I think the 3 raw/crudo items were our favorite. Go here!",

    "text": "I gave this place a low score because we were expecting dining and not finger foods.  If you happen to come here for a good filling meal, well, make the best of it.  For some reason this place looked like it had dining but the orders are TINY and expensive.  If its supposed to be only a bar with finger foods, don't put dining areas.   We were 3 starving people looking for a good restaurant not a bar with finger portion foods.  So, we ordered three things, the 7oz steak $21, the scallops $21 and the special bass fish $49.  The steak was ok, it's like any other steak with some herbs on top.  Again, its not too filling for 7 ozs.     the Scallops was the worst dish . You get two whopping scallops.  NOT ENOUGH FOOD FOR A 3 YEAR OLD.   The only good meal here surpisingly was the grilled sea bass for 49 bucks.  They gave you the whole sea bass fairly big (3 pounds?) maybe we just got lucky and they gave us a big fish, and it was pretty delicious considering we were 3 starving people that got a small slab of steak and 2 scallops.    TIP:  I would suggest if you are hungry ask the waiter what is the largest portioned items on the menu.  The brussel sprouts were good but I think we got like 8 brussel sprouts maybe 9 pieces, on second thought maybe it was 6 pieces cut in halves.  We were really dissapointed since we saw such a high review of the restaurant. Note:  The brussel sprouts and the bass fish was pretty good though.  I'd give it a 5 star for these two dishes.  the bass fish was a 6 star.",

    "text": "I would definitely return to sugarcane...but maybe just for the happy hour.   If you love seafood, tapas, and good drinks, this place is your jam.  Raw bar, crudos, ceviches, tartares.  We indulged in everything from lobster to octopus to salmon to tuna to hamachi.  Drinks were on point - I loved the prosecco and my husband loved his mixed drinks. We held back a little because we planned to check out the Dorsey afterwards.  The food prices though, were exorbitant to say the least. $54 for a dozen oysters. $21 for a single octopus leg. We for a couple of drinks and bites and left with a $180 bill. It was also really easy to tell they were taking shortcuts to lower the cost of dishes. Plates were filled with various vegetables. Cuts of the fish and lobster were diced and mixed with sauces (kind of like how spicy tuna is just day old tuna mixed with sauces). Not like the amazing lobster rolls where you get whole chunks of meat.  I really wish they could bring the prices down 20-25% to be inline with value of the experience and also just the rest of the strip. The drinks were about right though - $10-12 for basic prosecco.   Happy hour prices are much better though - about 40% lower than the regular menu.  Service was very mediocre. We sat at the bar at 7:09 and the bartender gave us the happy hour menu which got us excited only to tell us 4 minutes later that we missed the happy hour that ended at 7pm. Bummer.  And then he forgot our sliders and recommended the salmon poke which was good but not as good as the rest of the meal. We enjoyed ourselves but were excited to leave to check out something else.",

First the ambience is like a Havana club and the music compliments the ambience perfectly. We have also discovered they have the best staff in the city. We started with a cold beer and a mango pureed cocktail topped with Jalapeno, to die for. The garden salad with goat cheese has an awesome dressing and is ample enough for 2 or 3. We had the crispy mashed potatoes, skirt steak and corn. Each one complimenting the other. You need to go",

    "text": "First of all, let me say the food was fantastic. We had the foie gras fries (amazing) and the cubano sandwich. They are the reason why this review still has two stars to give.   The service, however, was atrocious. We arrived shortly after 1pm on a Thursday. The place was quite empty. We were seated quite quickly, but then, it was a good 10 minutes before anyone even said hi to us afterwards. No hi, no drink orders. Nothing.   Finally, someone came to serve water... to the table next to us. He poured them water, and walked away, saying nothing. Not sure if he went to refill the pitcher, but it was a while until he returned to offer us water.   And still, no waiter. At all.   A while later we finally had a waiter stop by. We asked for our drinks and, having by then had time to pick out food choices from the menu, asked a question about the availability of a dish. The waiter left promising to check on the dish, and get our drinks.   10 minutes later, we still had no answer, and no drink. Our waiter had apparently been busy running the check for a couple other tables. In the meantime, I could see my drink order, melting on the bar, waiting to be picked up.   (When it finally was my drink, on my table - a house-made soda with half orange coconut juice, half passion fruit juice - it was not at all what was described.  It tasted, simply, as a squeezed passion fruit juice with a ton of ice.  There was absolutely no hint of coconut, nor was the drink fizzy at all, as a soda would entail.  Either the ton of ice had melted by then, overpowering the other flavors, or the waiter/bartender really made a mistake there.  But it was too late already to even dare to ask for a re-do.)  We finally ordered our food.  And that's where the two stars in the review come from: It arrived fairly quickly, and everything we ordered (a Cuban sandwich and a foie gras fried rice) were absolutely great - as great as advertised by all the hype.  Unfortunately, I don't think they were great enough to entice another visit, considering we came this close to simply walking out early on.  Maybe we were just unlucky, maybe it was a bad time of the day, I don't know.  But it was one of the worst services I've ever received, for a not-so-cheap place during a not-so-crowded hour.",

    "text": "The Goods 1. Sugarcane inside Venetian - Tapas style service alongside fresh seafood 2. Shrimp Cocktail: Nothing out of the ordinary, the remoulade that came with it was good 3. Cocktail/Spice of Love: GreyGoose Vodka, Mango/Passionfruit Puree, and jalapeno - this was very good.  Nice blend of juice, liquor, and was refreshing 4. Eggplant: sauteed.  I normally don't care too much for eggplant but this tasted very good.  5. Roasted Corn/Cheese: this is like a fancified \"Elote' but the ears of corn taken off for you.  I do like cheese, this cheese was a bit too \"heady\" even for me.  But otherwise good. 6. Sauteed shrimp: yummy and garlicy.  It was cooked well and well seasoned, although it didn't stick out to me/memorable. 7. Kalbi ribs: tender!  Having a Korea background, I guess it felt like the usual for me though.  I know how I can get good kalbi ribs cheaper and more!  And it belongs with side dishes and rice  8. Dessert: Dulde De Leche soaked French toast, maple carmelized apples, and cinnamon ice cream - this was my favorite part of the meal, It was very good  Service: 1. Friendly and efficient 2. Its tapas style so it feels casual, but otherwise food runners to bring out food as they are ready and server to help manage the dining experience.  Ambiance: 1. Dark with candles, I can see it as a place to just have a romantic dinner or catch up with friends.  Fairly small although they seem to have a back/tucked away banquet type room not typically seated.  2. Sit at the bar or table.  Has a shnazzy Vegas strip feel on the inside.    MoJo 1. I liked the idea of tapas. 2. The cinnamon ice cream was really good 3. If you're more into fresh/raw seafood, you'll probably love this place more than me.",

When I was here last time with friends from work (total of 5), we were seated at a table.  Anyways, we ordered the following:  - fried brussel sprouts: light and crispy, with the right amount of balsamic vinegar to give it an oomph - pig ear papaya salad - we ordered this one extra crispy and it was so good, Earl ordered a second one - salmon poke - fresh small chunks of salmon tossed in a light soy sauce, sesame and seaweed, I can eat two orders myself because it was so good and refreshing - fresh oysters - we got 2 dozen and 1 oyster was bad...boo, but other than that, for the price ($1.50/oyster) with the other 23 oysters being fresh, it was ok.  Of course they are not Shigoku, Kusshi or Kumamoto, but they are still good for that price (I cannot remember the type of oysters they were).  Also, the first plate that came out to us did not have horseradish, so we had to ask for it.  But the bartender made sure that the second plate contained all the condiments.  I got the mojito and 1/4 through it I was quite buzzed.  Earl had a few drinks on the rocks, and our bill came out to be only a bit over $100.  Not bad at all.  We will definitely return.",

As we thought we were done with our meal another order came in. It was awkward that we had to return it because we were too full. The manager was professional and took it off our bill.  Also, the shrimp cocktail was $9 with only one shrimp. The restaurant promotes family style. It was a jumbo shrimp, but we were not informed it comes with only one. It made it awkward to share one shrimp with our dining companions, so we didn't share it, only one person had it. They could have suggested that if we plan to share, maybe we should order more than one or indicate that it comes with one shrimp.  It is rare that I give a one star review. It is unfortunate that I cannot recommend this restaurant to others. They did not have a full room on a Saturday night is telling of how they are doing.

I asked about a server who gave us water and never returned to take our order. I asked to speak to a manager to point out people who sat near us who were helped immediately and he brought us free beignets which we didn't touch because people just stared at us. Then it dawned on me, we are the only black people in here and they want us to leave. So we left, worst experience of my life and if you choose this place I hope it's better than our experience. Also, just so we're clear I never use my race as a reason for anything but this was intentional. We weren't loud or rude, we sat quietly and waited and they just wanted us to leave...I don't need to stay somewhere that doesn't want my business.",

Omg, so delicious. A must try. Best I've ever had.  Thanks, to Josh we had a memorable experience and loved what he picked out. We'll try the drinks next time promise! We will be back!",

I should have started my meal off with that and ordered a second helping instead of eating the lamb. My friend ordered the chicken meal and it was quite small. He ended up eating some of my lamb. The chicken meal is definitely not a meal for a grown man. :)",

The bartenders were so nice and accommodating.  From the beginning, all the staff made me and my friend feel welcomed and were so friendly. The manager, Maxine even came by to say hello and thanked us for coming by.   Couldn't imagine things getting better than this, but it did!! You MUST TRY the pig ear pad thai, brussel sprouts and the bacon wrapped dates. I didn't know something could taste that good! Gotta give mad props to the chef that created those items. At first I was skeptical at trying pig ears but OMG, it was so crunchy that it didn't have that rubbery pig cartilage texture I imagined. I LOVE pig ear pad thai  and trust me, eating animal parts other than meat is really hard for me to swallow. The brussel sprouts were glazed just right and so tasty. Lastly, the bacon wrapped dates is a party in your mouth. Just try it and you'll see what I'm talking about..  What made my experience at Sugarcane even better was the music!! After a few drinks, I just had to get up and dance. Even though it was just me and my amiga, the restaurant let us dance the night away (thank you), which by far was one of the best nights I had in Vegas. DJ Matt mixes really good music that even some staff had a move or two.   This restaurant really knows how to take care of its patrons. I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone going to Venetian. Thank you Sugarcane!",

Muddled strawberries and fresh mint - it was like a shower in your mouth!! Best drink I've had in a long time!  We stopped here to have an appetizer and drink while were waiting for another place and it was a perfect pit stop. Great drinks and service, a tad pricey however because of its location in the Venetian Resort/Casino.  The menu is limited, if you don't enjoy seafood such as scallops or tuna tartare this is not the place for you. My friend ordered French fries. We ordered ceviche; it was served in a way I've never had before. There was corn, hominy which added a whole dimension of texture to the dish.  However it was not a huge serving so portions st this restaurant are more like tapas sized. If you're hungry keep that in mind because you'll probably end up ordering 3-4 dishes off the appetizer menu. Lol  Maybe not for food, but definitely the muddled strawberry cocktails!!!",

And the other reason is that the portions are small and I left the restaurant a little hungry.   But other then that the restaurant was very good. Like I said before, service started off A+ with the hostess and waiter explaining the restaurant and menu well and giving me suggestions on what to eat. After deciding on the oxtail Benedict and a fresh squeezed OJ, the waiter was quick to bring the setting and the drinks. But once I was served the main dish, that was the last time I saw the waiter. Never came by for water refill or to see how the food was or with the check.  I watched the other wait staff basically do the same which was kind of weird. Why start good just to end bad?  The food and drinks were really good but small. OJ was delicious and water was clean and filtered. The oxtail Eggs Benedict was very delicious. If the dish was larger, it would be hands down the best breakfast I've had in a long time. But I had to savor the small portion that I got. The oxtail was pulled off the bone and covered by poached eggs over a toast. There was a delicious sauce on the oxtail too. Overall nice breakfast but would have to order another dish next time to be full.",

The restaurant was pretty empty, and happy hours were still happening, so we moved to the bar and basically ordered all of their happy hour specials (I wish I could say I was impressed)  6 oysters  2 Sliders  Pig ear pad thai Salmon poke  Bacon wrapped dates  A beef empanada  Japanese fried chicken (this was off the dinner menu)  The good: The sliders and empanada were delicious and we could have each eaten 3 of them! The bacon wrapped dates also had beef wrapped in them, making the dish surprisingly filling and satiating!  The OK:  Th oysters were alright. There could have been more horseradish to the oysters and it took awhile to come. Apparently, everyone orders the oysters during happy hour and there is only one person shucking them.  The bad: As an Asian person, it was a super bummer that all of the Asian dishes sucked. The salmon poke was waay too salty and had no flavor other than that. The pig ear pad thai has absolutely ZERO resemblance to pad thai and was basically fried pig ears dunked in honey or maple syrup. It was overly sweet and had no papaya salad in it either (menu is very very misleading). The Japanese chicken was also not Japanese at all. There was more batter than chicken and zero flavor whatsoever. Such a disappointment.   As for drinks, the mojito was super minty and I could have had 3 of them. But the meal itself was not really filling and missed the mark, as a whole. For happy hour prices, my bill came to $80 without tax-- and that's with me sharing a cocktail! NOT WORTH IT!  4 hours after this meal, I was starving and ended up going to a steakhouse to share a 12 oz. prime rib with my boyfriend. It was only then that I felt satisfied with dinner.",

I had the frose which was a frozen treat and the Strawberry Balsamic which was delightful and not sweet.  My food choices were the Pig Ear pad Thai and the goat cheese croquets which complemented each other.  The Pad Thai was crispy, cold, and sweet while the croquets were warm and earthy.    I don't get to the strip often, but I need to add this to my list.",

So we were going to go to YardBird, but we decided on sugarcane because there was a larger variety of options for lunch/brunch  I got the avocado toast with a side of Brussels sprouts  My sister got the duck fried rice, which was not on the menu during lunch but they were nice enough to make it for her  Her boyfriend got the steak and eggs which comes with a salad.  My avocado toast wasn't bad, the avocado tasted more like guac than it did avocado, which bothered me. It was a little too citrus-y. The Brussels sprouts were amazing though   My sisters dish looked great and she said it was amazing.  Her boyfriends dish was good, up until he saw a wasp in his salad. He's a fairly chill person so no freak out. We just called the waiter over and they took the dish back and made a new one. According to the manager or whoever was on duty, because there ingredients are so fresh the wasp likely got stuck in there during the process of collecting the lettuce/spinach. I mean I guess it makes sense but how come that wasn't spotted prior.  They were very apologetic and did give ya free dessert but it's hard to forget",

The pig ear & cocktail came out super quick but took forever for the yellow tail. Our server kind of disappeared after people started trickling in even though the place was more than half empty.

Treated almost like royalty - or I'll say - super spoiled -- because we are locals and they LOVE their locals.  Manager, Will, was so attentive and friendly - made us feel  like we were regulars for years!  The food is delicious - the sausage stuffed dates wrapped in bacon melt in your mouth.  We tried the seared scallops, I believe they were served with a turnip horseradish puree, not positive, but so delicious. Food is tapas style, which is great because you don't over eat.  We chose the Sugarcane seafood tower.  It comes with lobster, shrimp, Alaskan king crab legs, oysters and rock crab claws.  It's probably good for three people, but me and my husband killed it (combined appy and dinner, all in one.)  Drinks were delicious.  I had the vodka/mango puree with jalenpeno (Spice of Love) and my husband had the rum old fashioned.  On point!  Service was fantastic.  Friendly and professional wait staff.  Great atmosphere.  A wonderful time all around.  Will recommend to all our friends and we will be back!  Thanks for a great night!",

Before we were finished we had ordered the majority of the small plates, and almost every single one was on point.  The highlights for me were the Brussel Sprouts, the Goat Cheese Croquettes, and the Bacon Wrapped Dates. I think I ate almost the entire bowl of brussel sprouts myself, fighting off anyone who dared fly their fork in the nearby airspace. The dates were huge and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Even better, they were stuffed with manchego cheese and sausage...absolutely phenomenal. I was the only one take down an entire date by myself.  The only disappointment for me was the Seared Sea Scallops. The dish came with two gigantic scallops, definitely the biggest I've ever seen. Perhaps this is why they tasted a bit chewy to me...the sauce was also forgettable. Definitely not terrible, but for the price it was the worst thing we ordered.   To drink I ordered a Tobacco Rum Old Fashioned which was amazing. I don't usually like old fashioneds, but the substitution of whiskey for rum made all the difference for me. Finally, the service was great and the decor (especially the flooring) really worked for me...Definitely didn't feel at all like we were inside of a shopping mall.",

First, the service was ok only, took the waitress 15 mins to come over to greet us and bring us water. We ordered 3 items(Scallop, Ahi Salad, Shrimp Cocktail) on the menu and I was curious why she mentioned that she'll leave us the menu in case we wanted to order more. Anyway, spent roughly $60 and the portions were so tiny that it's barely considered an appetizer let alone a meal. Food was ok, service was somewhat ok. Too pricey though. You'd want to go to Grand Lux instead, more bank for your bucks and service is much more attentive!",

Located on the strip in the Venetian -- this tri-kitchen (open fire grill, raw bar, and traditional kitchen) tapa style restaurant is full of good food and good vibes! I wouldn't recommend coming here with the intent of getting full (the little plates do add up price-wise!), but every bite screams with exquisite taste and gorgeous presentation.  We ordered: - RUM & RUMBLE (Cocktail): Flor de Cana 7yr Anejo rum, yuzu, dry vermouth, agave, blackberry puree, cardamom bitters, fresh basil.  - GOAT CHEESE CROQUETTES ($13.00): Four large breaded balls of goat cheese with  membrillo marmalade.  - BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($12.00): Small bowl of crispy brussel sproats with oranges & sweet soy.  - BACON WRAPPED DATES ($16.00): Three bacon wrapped dates with linguica and manchego - PIG EAR PAD THAI ($14.00): Crispy slivers of pig ear with papaya salad.  - SPARE RIBS ($14.00): Five spice & honey spare ribs with coriander & chilis - DUCK & WAFFLES ($24.00): Crispy leg confit and duck egg on top of a waffle with mustard maple.  - BONE MARROW ($29.00): Bone marrow veal cheek with marmalade - FOIE GRAS FRIED RICE ($29.00): Foie gras fried rice with shredded duck, coriander, kecap manis.  - WHOLE ROASTED CHICKEN ($43.00): Roasted chicken with truffle marble potato, wild mushrooms.  - TORREJAS ($12.00): Dulce de leche soaked french toast, maple caramelized apples, cinnamon ice cream.

We came right at dinner hour and were very quickly seated. The food was extremely unique and a strange combination of Asian fusion.  The duck waffles are surprisingly a must.  They are much more savory than your typical chicken and waffles and the combination of the syrup and egg with every bite is simply a delight.  My second favorite dish was the mushrooms which were uniquely prepared and far different than any other I have had.  I loved the galbi ribs which come it on an authentic sizzling dish that you'd expect from K-town.  The bacon wrapped dates consisted of the biggest dates I've ever seen in the dish which for me wasn't a big plus as I prefer the bacon part more.  Such an eclectic menu that is surely to please everyone's taste buds.   My only constructive criticism is that the service can be a bit slow. It would take a while to refill our drinks or to even grab the check.  Otherwise, the food is definitely worth it!",

Well, that trip happened and I am so happy we didn't pass up eating here. The food was phenomenal and the service was also on point.  We came here on a Sunday night. It wasn't crowded so we were seated right away. Water quickly came to the table and our waiter came by to take our drink order. He was very patient in explaining the menu and giving us plenty of time to narrow down our choices. It was hard picking what we want to try because everything sounded delicious but we were only two people.   Here's what ended up on our table: * half dozen oysters - super fresh and delicious  * kinilaw kampachi ceviche - refreshing and light, loved the puffed rice crunch in the bite * pig ear pad thai - stand out dish. So many different textures and flavor all in one bite. MUST TRY! * heirloom tomato & burrata - basic, tomato and burrata but very creamy and light. Exactly what we wanted before the heavier dishes came * thai style pork ribs - exploding with flavors. Meat fell off the bone. Excellent. * bone marrow - HOLY FAWK! Another stand out. Our waiter said it's the best bone marrow he's ever eaten when we place our order and I thought well, I'll be the judge of that but hot damn he is right. Pretty big dish for two people and by the time it arrived, I was already on the full side. Didn't think we could finish this but boy did we polish it off after trying a bite. So full of rich beef flavor and fatty goodness. Perfect with the grilled bread that came with it. Will absolutely go back just to eat this again.  Another cool thing about this restaurant is that it has an extensive list of rum. My husband is a whisky type of man but he found some great sipping rum here. Our waiter had really good knowledge of the collection and was great at explaining it to us.   Overall experience was excellent. Even though there are countless amazing restaurants to try on The Strip alone, I will be making room to come back here the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "So happy to find this spot inside the Venetian across from Yardbird. Looked at the menu and saw tapas style as well as large plates. After perusing the drooling menu, my friend and I saw Foie Gras Fried Rice and Bone Marrow. We were immediately sold on those two dishes and decided to dine in. Our waitor was on point and said their bone marrow was the best in town, boy was he right! The bone marrow was so delicious, it has a sweetness to it due to the slow cooked beef on top that took the dish to the next level. Next the foie gras fried rice...this was another amazing dish made well. The season rice had a little sweetness to it that balanced well with the foie gras and to top it off, a fried egg, WOW! We also had their brussel sprouts and a hamachi crudo that made for a nice appetizer. Looking forward to trying more dishes and next time some libations.",

Not drastically different from what you can get elsewhere, but will executed.   Goat cheese croquet were great.  They are a must have.  Bacon wrapped dates - they are great...but they're are only 3.  You could half them if you have a bigger group and you just want a taste.  Brussels sprouts - man I hate them, but... I loved these.  Something with the citrus and balsamic.  Get them, they are great.  The recipe is also online.   Crispy smashed potatoes - meh, just ok.  Had better.  I would pass.   Pig ear pad Thai - unique.  Not pad Thai but tasted good.  Won't find this dish anywhere else.   Beef short ribs - they were good, but we had better elsewhere  Spanish octopus - it was tender, but could have had more flavour.  Just had siracha  Japanese egg plant - pass on it.  Not great.   Skirt steak - pass.  Bland.  Needed more salt and maybe garlic to liven it up. Disappointed.   Wait staff were great! The menu changes here, but the staples are normally available.  Wish the harissa beets were offered when we were there.",

Every time Andy and I come here we start with the carpaccio and scallops. The carpaccio is truly amazing. We usually both eat 2 each every visit. It's made out of Wagu beef and comes with kimichi pickles and topped with a black garlic aoli AMAZING! The scallops come on a thin slice of green apple and in a citrus sauce topped with black truffles.  For entrees We have tried the skirt steak (topped with chimichurri) the 24oz. bone-in ribeye with foie gras & wild mushroom nage, and creamy polenta, and the mini maine lobster rolls. All we're absolutely amazing!  The service is always on point and we have a great time every visit. I highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "YOU MUST TRY THE HARISSA BEETS!!! These were the best beets I've ever had. Even if you're not a huge beet fan, try them anyway! Another must try is the pig ear pad Thai. It was so delicious and crunchy. Not like anything I've ever had. I would pass on the Thai style pork ribs and the Japanese eggplant. Nothing great to say about those. The foie gras fried rice was also very tasty. The Spanish octopus was so so, it was good but I've had better octopus.   My wife and I were stuffed. Overall, it was a good meal and very reasonably priced for being in Vegas. We finished off our meal with an off menu special key lime pie with coconut ice cream.   Our server, Ken, was also very attentive and noticed every little detail. He made sure our dinner experience was phenomenal!  I had to deduct a star for the couple of dishes that weren't great and also our booth that we were seated at had paint splatter all over the seats. At first, they looked like crumbs and thought the seats were dirty. The manager had stopped by our table to see how our dinner was and I let him know Ken was great but was a little turned off by the seats. He explained that the painters did not do a great job. I agree with that but as a patron for this establishment, seeing the splatters made the place feel dirty. At least take care of the bad paint work and clean up their mess before having people sit there.",

    "text": "My girls and I decided to try Sugarcane after viewing their restaurant week menu. For $20, their prix fixe lunch menu was a great deal, especially since the items included were offered on their regular menu as well. If you are a first time diner and eat between now and June 30th, I highly suggest this restaurant because you can sample what they have to offer for a great discount. Even if you cannot eat during the restaurant week, their prices are still decent, especially for being on the strip. Tapas range from $7-22, with the more decadent dishes like the bone marrow ranging closer to $28. You can also order full size entrees for a few dollars more. Plus, they have a great happy hour menu from 4-7PM and 11PM-close that offers half off prices on many popular appetizers and drinks. After our first experience, Sugarcane will definitely be one of my favorite dining spots on Restaurant Row.  Let's talk about Location and Ambiance It's a bit tricky to find because the restaurant is located at the very end, or beginning of Restaurant Row, depending on where you parked. You can access it if you park at either Venetian or Palazzo, but keep in mind it is located at the end, depending on where you're coming from.  The decor is very simple and elegant. Think beige leather seats with dark wall panels and glass window accents, flower-petal ceiling fans and a large mixology bar that spans across the length of the whole place. Lighting is dimmed and almost feels like a combination of old English game room meets cigar lounge meets historic library room. It's the perfect ambiance for business dinners or intimate brunch.   Let's talk about Food Sugarcane's menu is heavily influenced by Eastern cuisine. I would say about 80% of the items on their menu is an Asian fusion of some type. Their food was absolutely delicious, although it is on the smaller size (tapa style).   Our first course was the Snapper Ceviche (aji Amarillo, sweet potato, crispy maiz concha) and Salmon Poke (seaweed, sesame, soy). Both dishes were fresh and distinct in its taste. The snapper was more on the light citrus side whereas the salmon was savory and saltier. Both was very good and a great palette starter.   **The second course was the Brussels sprout (orange, sweet soy) and the bacon wrapped date (linguica, machego). These two items stole the show! At first, I was skeptical about the items because they seemed very ordinary, however, it was definitely one of the best pairings I've ever tasted. The brussels sprouts was charred to perfection and then glazed with a sweet soy reduction. It was paired with orange slices that added tartness to the sweet and slightly bitter taste of the dish. It was the perfect combination of flavors. As for the date wrapped bacon, it was my absolute favorite! The date was sweet on the outside and stuffed with delicious linguica (Portuguese) sausages. When eaten with the bacon, it enhanced the smokey flavor of both meats very well. I actually anticipate on going back just to order this item on their regular menu.   The third course was the chicken thigh (gem lettuce wrap, sweet soy) and angus slighter (Tonkatusu, caramelized onions, shitake). To be honest, I wasn't a big fan of either. But to be fair, it was hard to impress after the brussel sprouts and bacon wrapped date. The chicken thigh was grilled well but tasted like ordinary teriyaki chicken.The slider was extremely salty. It had way too much wasabi sauce that over powered the other flavors. I don't think I'd be ordering those two again in the future.   Lastly, we had the Torrejas for dessert which is a caramel french toast topped with caramelized apples and cinnamon ice cream. The dessert was decadent, albeit a bit sweet with the caramel/vanilla sauce. However, it wasn't bad by any means.   Let's talk about Service Our server (Russell, I think?) was great. He was very charming and courteous. However, I did deduct 1 star from this review mainly because the overall service was extremely slow and unstructured. We came during lunch so it wasn't busy at the time. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and there was a 10-15 minute wait in between the courses. There were many times we had to stack empty plates on the table, expecting someone to pick it up, but no one ever came. The runner that dropped the food completely ignored the plates. He served us the new dishes and walked away. It wouldn't have been a problem had the table not been small to begin with, and with all of those extra plates, our dining surface felt very cluttered. The busser didn't come around until our desert course. By that time, our water wasn't refilled even once, and the dirty plates were stacked even higher at the end of our table. For a casino restaurant on the strip, the service was disappointing.  Overall, I still recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back simply because the food is that good. Hopefully, next time the service will be better.",

The Asian style fired chicken was less memorable. Oh and the deserts were well tasty.",

We walked in and no one greeted us even after two men in suits looked at us & went on their business. Looked around and we walked in on the bar side so we walked to another entrance were there was a hostess. We were finally greeted and one of the man in a suit was one of the managers. We were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar side or the restaurant. We picked the latter. Very few tables were occupied and we were greeted right away by our server.   Ordered dirty martini and it did not come the way it was ordered. But that did not bother us. We wanted oysters but the price for the happy hour for oysters was only for the bar side it was either $1 at the bar or $54 for a dozen at the restaurant side. We ended up ordering the shellfish tower so we can have a little bit of everything and it was disappointing!!!  Ordered a few more items seared sea scallops, Brussels sprouts which was very good and according to our waiter they have the filet mignon special which was not bad at all.",

The acidity brings out the tuna flow. The texture of the tartar contrast with the crispiness of the chip.   They also changed plates when we finished duck dish and about to have the seared scallops afterwards  The tepan American wagyu beef is delicious! It's off the menu. The chef is a magician using ponzu. I have never seen non Japanese restaurant used ponzu so well. They poured the ponzu sauce on the tepan after they served on the table. The beef is cooked to perfection with pink in the center. It's very tasty! I have nevered tried beef with ponzu and Can not imagine they go so well together. Hopefully they can put it in the menu in the future!   Spanish bread pudding with ice cream is really good too.   The service is spot on! Our waiter is really nice.",

This place is good to share with a group of four because the quantity is not a lot here.  Dim light atmosphere and spacious to sit with friends. Service was pretty quick here, except the wait for the whole roasted chicken.   We ordered two small bites and one large plate for a group of 4, which is enough to make us satisfied.     Blue Fin Tuna Tartare- It was really good and crunchy to munch on. It has a strong citrus taste on the fish, but the quality is over the top.  Pig Ear Pad Thai- Not really pad thai, mainly fried crispy pig ears top with a small garnish of radishes and carrots. I find this dish interesting to munch on because it tastes like fried pork skin, but more on a sweeter side. I would recommend giving this dish a try!   Whole Roasted Chicken- The wait for this takes forever, but the chicken was so juicy and tender. The gravy sauce was an excellent match with the chicken. It comes with Truffle marble potato and wild mushrooms. I also recommend this dish to try- A MUST!!",

A tiny, but tasty portion of fresh yellowtail in a yuzu soy sauce. Pleasant Latin/Japanese fusion, but no more than an appetizer.

We came on a Wednesday night at around 11 so right in time for happy hour. It wasn't too packed at first but as it got to midnight, it got its typical Vegas-packed since there's always some conference or event going on here.  When I scan a happy hour menu, I usually look for a couple of drinks and they had an old fashioned ($7)! It was delicious and strong, which is all I ask for in an old fashioned, but not every place can do it right. My girlfriend got the strawberry balsamic which was one of those drinks that doesn't taste like it has alcohol so it's very dangerous! The mojito ($6) actually tasted like it had alcohol in it which is different from other mojitos we've had.   A huge shoutout to our bartender Taylor who, with all the craziness and the running around, kept a smile on her face the entire time. Our drinks came out a little slower than usual but as were watching her sitting at the bar she was always smiling and never looked like she hated what she was doing or wanted her shift to be over.  Another shoutout to all the bartenders because there was a guy causing some problems with other people. They complained and the bartenders handled it professionally and promptly.",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch with a friend while here for a conference.  I've always wanted to try this place because it's always crowded - so I'm thinking \"it must be good, right?\"  I ordered the wedge salad and the skirt steak with chimichurri. My friend asked for recommendations and the server said \"I don't know, it depends on what you have a taste doe...\".  Ok, well that was completely unhelpful. Either th server didn't know the menu or just didn't want to be bothered. He ordered the Brussels sprouts and grilled shrimp. First came my salad. Minutes later came my steak. A bit later his Brussels sprouts. I was nearly finished with my meal (shared my steak so he would have something to eat while he endured the ridiculously long wait) and I finally got the attention of our very inattentive and unfriendly waiter - and asked about the shrimp. No apology and no emotion, \"let me check\".  After several minutes he came out with a beer for a nearby table. He was attemtpting to walk by and we stopped him again and this time he said only \"shrimps on the way\". What? Another server eventually brought the shrimp. Our server (he never introduced himself by name) didn't ever come back to ask how the food was or apologize for the long wait or anything. As a matter of fact, he didn't show up again until he brought the check - which he put down on the table without saying a f@$&!'ing word!  This was really really bad service and I really wanted to like this place. The food was good enough but for first impressions and overall service they scored an \"F\". I definitely would not come back here and would definitely not recommend it to anyone who cares about having good service and a positive dining experience.  My recommendation to restaurant ownership and management - hire and train employees for attitude, not just their experience. You can teach someone how to be a good server, you can't teach a positive and friendly attitude.",

Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian Hotel, we were able to walk in around 730pm on a Sunday night. We had just missed HH which was from 4-7pm.   We decided to order the servers recommendations: - Passionfruit Mojito (Sugarcane in the drink was a nice touch) - Bacon Wrapped Dates - Ahi Blue Fin Tuna Tartare - Goat Cheese Croquettes  - Korean Style Short Ribs (I would skip this next time. Nothing too special about it)  - And for dessert: Torrejas - Dulce de Leche soaked french toast with maple carmelized apples and cinnamon ice cream  Everything was delicious, staff was friendly, and the price is decent considering the location. This spot totally surprised us. I'll definitely be back for more!",

Also kudos to the other bartenders because there was a point where there was a fight and they were good at handling the situation.   I actually really liked all of the drinks that I ordered off their HH menu. My favorite was the strawberry balsamic. We didn't get a chance to order food because the bar kept getting busier and busier. I'd love to be able to come back and try more of their menu. I'd suggest that if you're planning on getting food to sit at a table so you don't have to fight anyways to put in an order.",

We came late around 11pm it wasn't busy at all and they had late night happy hour and a really good DJ playing music. I got to revisit some of my favorite dishes like the Duck & Waffle, croquettes and bacon wrapped dates which were all absolutely incredible tasting and looking. The best surprise though was the Pig Ear Pad Thai, for people that find that gross please trust me it will amazing, one of the best dishes I've had in a while. On top of the food the drinks were also amazing and only like $8-9 for happy hour, I'm very picky with my mojitos and these were on point...i felt like i was right back in Miami. I would suggest the Beet Juice Mojito, it was pretty much a cold pressed juice with mint and rum. Service was also amazing, the bartender was great and cool to talk too.",

    "text": "This was a random find as I was trying to kill time before hotel check-in. I was hungry and wanted something with an egg at like 9am. Saw their menu as I was making my way to Grand Lux, so I gave up on Grand Lux.  I probably looked like a mess without makeup and in a onesie (jk, it's a long romper), but service was still fine. My server was very friendly. She and the manager came by a good amount to check in on me. This should be some usual practice, but it doesn't happen that often. As someone dining alone, it was a good amount where you don't feel too left out and ignored, but you still enjoy your little \"me time\".  I started the meal with a cocktail. since it's my first meal and drink of the day, got something light on the menu: garden essence. Exactly as its name, it has a floral undertone, got a nice aroma of crushed basil, and finish with a peppery taste. It's like a youthful drink for an old soul. You know how gin and tonic is an old person's drink? (Did you just assume my generation?????) The drink itself is delicate and refreshing, not a single flavor was overpowering one another. Great for some wake me up for brunching softly feels.  Ordered a truffled toad in the hole, basically an egg in toast with cheese and black truffle on top. The giant brioche toast had honey drizzled all over, had a good contrast with the savory cheese and egg. The truffle was a gentle touch to the dish. It wasn't overwhelming considered how it's a strong flavored ingredient. Now just cut it all up, poke that yolk, mix it up, and swallow it whole.  All praises for this place.",

It's located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian Hotel.  We went on a Saturday night around 8:00pm and were able to walk-in.  The bar is where it's at!  Bartenders are friendly and engaging and the crowd in general were all just having a good time.    The tapa style plates we tried were all so so good and unique.  My favorite dish was the bacon wrapped dates.  The crispy outer bacon complimented the sweet, soft date (it almost reminded me of the texture and flavor of sweet potato) and smoky sausage it encased.  I also really liked the pig ear pad thai.  I was apprehensive but the pig ears were thinly sliced and fried to crisp and crunchy perfection.  It was tossed with green papaya and thankfully not overdressed with the papaya salad dressing like sauce.  That dish was just tasty and a mix of wonderful textures.  Lastly, the brussel sprouts were bomb.  Most restaurants have brussel sprouts but I must say, these were my favorite preparation ever.  Roasted nicely and tossed in a soy glaze with orange slices.  A very yummy savory and sweet dish.    For drinks, I highly recommend their basil quencher.  Very refreshing and not too basil overpowered.  Alas, I wish I tried some desserts but I was stuffed!  Fridays and Saturdays they have DJ Matt Lucio mixing everything from latin to hip hop.  I think I had more fun here than the clubs lol.  Will definitely come back next trip to Vegas.",

This is a pretty spacious lounge / restaurant that has some killer happy hour specials from 5-7pm.  There was plenty of open seating and the service was fast and friendly. The bartender was very engaging and fun - he made it a great time!  The place is pretty modern with a very upbeat vibe and music.  The crowd was a little older so we didn't feel out of place.  We tried a couple of Happy Hour appetizer specials.  The briny oysters were outstanding and only $1.50 a piece!  These plump, fresh oysters tasted like they were just harvested.  The goat cheese croquettes were also delightful!  The bacon wrapped dates were quite good - but they only had 3 to a serving and went quickly.  They also have a variety of fancy drinks for only $8 - my wife loved her mojito and a rum/fruit cocktail.",

I had the buttermilk waffle and truffled toad in the hole, which both tasted too tangy for my taste buds.  I had one of their juices (pineapple-apple-lemon) which was warm and not as refreshing as I would have liked it.  Glad I got to try both, but I would have to say I prefer happy hour over brunch from my experience.",

Told to fill in a Chef-selected menu with anything eye-catching, several signatures from Miami imported just like Yardbird across the way, it was with the smoky-yet-palate-friendly Tobacco Rum Old Fashioned alongside a Barrel Aged Hemingway with a shaken Egg White that the meal got started, the Croquettes well complimented by Quince Jam while charred Sprouts with Citrus, sweet n' spicy Dates and Smoked Sturgeon Spread all paired well to the beverages, though the Potato Chips served with the latter were far too thin for scooping, thus compromising an otherwise delicious straight-out-of-Florida concept.  Self-selecting some raw stuff with a bit of influence from servers, the Hokkaido Scallop Crudo an unexpected surprise laid atop Apples with preserved Black Truffle and just a touch of heat, snappy Fluke impressed with its focus on subtlety while the smooth Lamb Tartare immediately showed signs of a kitchen willing to take chances, a beautiful presentation yielding the earthy aromatics of African spices that spread nicely on the housemade flatbread with brightness added by Pickled Mustard Seeds.  Investing in some sweeter drinks as plates grew heavier, the Vodka-based Strawberry Balsamic and Slurpee-style Champagne Cooler both the sort of drinks that could get lightweights into trouble while the \"Spice of Love\" was described as 'really hot' by those who tasted it, Pig Ear Pad Thai with Papaya was fun for both taste as well as texture while the same could be said for the Duck & Waffle that was as tasty as one might expect given the stack of ingredients atop a picture perfect Belgian Waffle.  All-in on the Foie Gras Bastilla, a shattering Wonton wrapped around shredded Leg Meat, crumbled Pistachios plus a thick slice of Duck Liver resting in a pool of Golden Raisin Puree, those looking for a simple yet bold taste are encouraged to check out some of the Chef's Mesquite-grilled creations, both the Mushrooms and Sweet Potatoes perfect for Vegetarians or those counting calories while the Quail features one of Sin City's most underused ingredients, the smooth Calabrian Sausage something that simply needs to be tasted in order to be fully appreciated.  Excited to see the restaurant serving Coffee Beans from La Colombe, the Philadelphia based roaster easily one of the Nation's most passionate and well respected, desserts once again speak of a kitchen reaching out to guests of all varieties, the Nutella Sundae sweet and sharable by groups while a beautiful Sesame Bombe is a far more subtle sort of dish that eats lighter than suggested by its description, the Spanish French Toast an immediate contender for the city's best dessert as the Caramelized Bread breaks to Custard amidst sauteed Apples and notes of Cinnamon plus Maple Butter still bubbling in the skillet.  ****Still a bit wet behind the ears in terms of service, both the Pad Thai and Lamb Merguez tipping over thanks to careless presentations, SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill is a great addition to Vegas' ever evolving culinary landscape and, at least thus far, one of the few recent additions showing signs of taking some real chances.",

The guy with the Mohawk is just plain curt and rude, and this is once a server acknowledged that I was being completely ignored for about 10 mins and personally asked him to serve me. The other bartender walked past me no less than 4x and never even once made eye contact or a simple I'm busy I'll be right with you. I might as well have not existed. The server next to me was polite enough to get the bartenders attention and asked him to serve me which was met with a short and curt ok and a facial look to match. It was not busy, slightly full but with still open available chairs at the bar. Either way, busy or not, should not excuse a complete lack of customer service and basic respect. A simple Im a little behind/busy, I will be right with you would have gone so far. They clearly need to be reminded of what exactly the job entails: anyone can learn to make a drink but it's the service we're paying and tipping for.",

    "text": "Best restaurant during our Vegas Trip! Sugarcane is tucked away in a corner of the Venetian and it's still fairly new, so reservations are easy to make online. We ate super late, but I'm so happy this was the last meal we had in Vegas because the food and service were awesome.  SERVICE = Started off a bit rocky until our waiter (his name is Munier) came around and he was great at explaining the dishes and also helped us with some rum flights. Really great service.  COCKTAILS = My brother is a big fan of their Manhattan - they also burnt an orange peel and spritzed a bit of orange mist onto the drink. I had their Beet Mojito, which tasted like a regular mojito despite the blood red color. My other brother requested for a few different rum shots recommended by the waiter and he really enjoyed them.   FOOD REVIEW =  Hokkaido Scallop: compressed apple, black truffle, lime & jalapeno ($16) --- I was expecting this to taste better, as I'm a huge fan of raw scallop... My only complaint is that there is more apple than scallop, so the tartness of the apple overpowers the dish.  Australian Grilled Lamb Chops: pomegranate, za'atar yogurt ($24) --- Oh man, so good. Perfectly grilled lamb chops at medium rare. Went well with the yogurt.  Brussels Sprouts: orange, sweet soy ($11) --- I was okay with this, but brother enjoyed it. Nice crispiness to it.  Spanish Octopus: aji panca ($15) --- Mmm was tender and flavorful.  Shrimp: sweet garlic, smoked paprika & charred bread ($18) --- This one wasn't too special, but the shrimp had a nice grilled taste to it.  Seared Sea Scallop: sunchoke three ways, watercress nage ($22) --- One of my favourite dishes. So good... I love the sunchoke sauce on the side of the plate. I ended up taking leftover greens on another plate and drenching it in the sauce to scoop it up. So good. Exactly how seared scallops should be enjoyed.  Bacon Wrapped Dates: linguica, manchego ($15) --- They did a unique take on this. Normally at other Spanish tapas places, they literally wrap bacon around a date. This place had a much larger piece that seemed like they mashed up date with another meat product (pork?) and cooked it in a ball shape that had a bit of a paste texture. It was delicious and definitely showed they went the extra mile to make this dish unique.  24oz. Bone-in Ribeye: foie gras & wild mushroom nage, creamy polenta ($95) --- Wowza, the steak here is A-MAZING! It's extremely flavourful, as the steak sits on a bed of rosemary and thyme covered with bits of mushroom and foie gras. I normally hate the taste of rosemary, but it really added to the steak in a beautiful way. The portion was great too, although expect to wait longer to get this dish. The creamy polenta was a let down... needed more butter so it could taste like yummy mashed potatoes. It had a nice lemon flavor though.   To compare steaks... A few nights prior we had an expensive steak at \"Bazaar Meat by Jose Andres\" that cost double the amount and was supposed to be larger.... It felt like there was less meat at Bazaar Meat and it wasn't very flavourful in comparison to the one at Sugarcane.   DESSERTS  Caramelized Bananas with Caramel (sorry - don't have the proper description as this was NOT on their regular dessert menu - don't have price either) --- Oh my God, SO GOOD. Exactly what you want in a banana dessert. You have to take a bite with everything on the same spoon and it's just heaven.  Avocado Chocolate Mousse with Pistachios (don't have price... was NOT on their regular dessert menu) --- This dessert took longer to prepare, but it was worth the wait. It was such an interesting concept (i.e. never had avocado and chocolate together). The mousse was so buttery and smooth and you could really taste the avocado mixed with it. Then there's the avocado pieces. The pistachio really compliments this dessert well and my only beef with this dessert is that they should have MORE pistachios to add to the texture. Really unique and fantastic dessert.",

They asked how we are doing and if we needed anymore drinks. I may want to try the food next time.",

I've dined here once, and would definitely come again to try more dishes.   Staff: The hostess was fine, the servers were great, and the manager was amazing! We had a party of 6 and he took care of us all and was extremely attentive the entire time.   Atmosphere: Vegas-like (Read: dark and kinda sexy), but more relaxed. We appreciated the chill vibes as our party had been in Vegas for an entire week for a trade show and our mind and bodies were hurting by the end of the week! Also, wait time was very short for a Friday night - possibly because they have recently opened?   Food: Started our meal with some kind of rose slushy drinks (on the house) which were fantastic. We ordered several dishes from their tapas style menu and I remember enjoying everything.  A few items that really stood out that I can still recall are as follows:  *Blue fin tuna tartare (yuzu kosho, avocado puree & sesame seeds)- Must order  *Smoked fish dip ( served w/ potato chips)- Dip was yummy, but chips were a bit burnt *Whole roasted chicken (truffle marble potato, wild mushrooms) - Simple, but very flavorful *Nutella sundae (nutella ice cream, nutella hazelnut brownie, cracker jacks)- LOVED it!!  Be sure to stop by if you're looking for a non-stuffy place with good drinks and shareable food! .",

Since it was Restuarant Week, the menu was limited to a few items but they were quite tasty.   I especially like the fried brussel sprouts.  We had bacon wrapped dates, I dont eat pork but the other ladies said they were terrific.  We also had spanish octopus,  skirt steak, salmon poke and goat cheese croquettes (to die for). We each had an order of these items and it was served family style which was perfect.  There were a few other things that was ordered that was just a tasty.   Glad I was able to try something different that didn't break the bank.  I suggest you try this place.",

His team works like a well oiled machine to ensure your food comes out in a timely manner and your glass is never empty.  Now to the food. This is a place that you can bring a group or the most picky eater knowing that everyone will find something they love. They have both small plates and large so you can share ....if you really want to. The creativity is apparent  from Duck confit and waffles for a perfect brunch, pigs ear pad Thai for the adventurous,  to dry aged ribeye for the traditional.   Tonight I had strawberry balsamic cocktail which is light and refreshing, the most delicious raw oysters and the petit filet Toban with asparagus and mushrooms with a truffle ponzu.   Don't forget to leave room for dessert as the creativity goes on and on. Sugarcane is my go to when I visit Vegas for it's great food and service.",

    "text": "Located in restaurant row between Palazzo & Venetian is this cool concept tapas spot. You can either choose from the raw bar, cooked kitchen, or open fire grilled side. The average cost of the plates is about $15. For two people with an average appetite (that doesn't have a bottomless fast food American pit) can get full with about 5 plates.   The good-  (2 pcs/$10) Chicken meatballs were deliciously moist and had a crunch to it from the almond gremolata. The charred cauliflower paired well with the meatballs.  (8pc/$15) Charred octopus on the skewer was very tender and the aji panca, which is a Peruvian pepper gave it the right hint of spice.   The ok-  ($14) West coast snapper ceviche tasted a little too fishy for me. I did like the addition of the toasted & soft corn kernels.  ($11) Pig ear pad Thai, flavor wise was good. But since I'm not a fan of eating pigs parts I wasn't to fond biting into the sliced up fried cartilage ear. It was combined with papaya salad, which did give it some freshness.  ($8) Sweet corn was just the typical elote off the cob. Nothing to impressive here.   Overall it's a great place for groups because you can try a whole lotta dishes. The service is excellent and would definitely go back.",

It was super easy to make and change the reservation.  We were a party of 4 that came in on Thursday night.  We were seated right away.  It wasn't too loud of a place, but still had a nice vibe for dinner and drinks.  Our server was great.  She helped us with recommendations and we were pleasantly surprised with majority of our order.  Moving onto the food:  Started off with the Blue Fin Tuna Tartare.  Came on a crunchy chip with yuzu kosho, avocado puree & sesame seeds. A must!!  Oysters - they were fresh and tasty.  We had a combo of West vs East.  Crispy Smashed Potato - This was good, but I would pass on it.  Came with salsa verde & romesco.  Goat Cheese Croquettes - OH MY GAWWW, just get it... Comes with membrillo marmalade.  Asparagus - delicious.  Drizzled with a generous amount of lemon aioli & mint gremolata   Wagyu Beef Carpaccio - Really good!  Came with kimchi pickles, black garlic aioli.  Seared Sea Scallop - Not a fan. Sunchoke three ways, watercress nage.  A5 Kobe Wagyu - Very flavorful! came with pickled honshemeji & truffle ponzu.  Bone Marrow - GREAT! veal cheek marmalade.  Ask for extra bread.  Overall, our palates were content and belly's full.  We had a taste of pretty much everything. I would definitely come back here.  Until next time Vegas!!",

The items are of the smaller end of the scale, but pretty much appropriate for \"small plate\" sharing.  They have a great good range of items to please most everyone.  I'd say that, overall, there are probably a handful of things that are great.  There are many items that are pretty good and a few things that don't really work for me in terms of flavor, composition, size, and/or cost.  The service has also been hit or miss and the decor & ambiance is interesting.  It's a nice straight-off-the-carpet place you can get to in between the Palazzo/Venetian casino complex and pretty consistent.",

However, this is probably the most underwhelming of all dishes because there's barely any scallop. It wraps the apple, which consists of 90% of each bite. While the flavor is good, i would go for another crudo dish.   Hamachi crudo (5/5) - The hamachi was so good and fresh. Must get!!!  Spanish octopus (4/5) - It was a little awkward to bite the octopus off of the skewer. A little smokey taste and flavorful, not too bad but probably won't order again.  Lamb chop (5/5) - I usually avoid lamb because of the game-y taste, but this was sooo tender, juicy, and not gamey at all. The yogurt and cranberry were aesthetically pleasing and interesting combo. You can eat separate or together, and both tastes amazing!   Duck foie gras fried rice (5/5) - The best dish of the night. I didn't have high expectations because this is more of a seafood restaurant but OMG that flavor doe. The fragrant fried rice perfectly complements the foie gras, which was rich but fresh. It was also very decent size so you definitely get your $'s worth. There's also duck meat mixed in the rice. It smelled so good and tastes even better. I was surprised by quality of flavors and almost wanted to order 2 more serving just for myself lol. We let the waiter mix the rice but next time I'll probably just eat it as presented. Overall, solid dish!",

    "text": "This place is really a gem, and Venetian/Palazzo is filled with them. The food here is awesome, but so far I've only had their happy hour dishes - next time I'm eyeing their foie and duck fried rice which reminds me of a fancy version of Kyrgyz plof made with lamb and lamb lard :). The menu is really interesting and eclectic, but not appropriative. It doesn't read like a Frankenstein's monster but rather as a carefully planned to world cuisine. The Miami vibe helps out too, one is put at ease with the beautifully designed bar the fans blowing overhead. The food: oysters, goat cheese croquettes, stuffed dates, salmon poke, pig ears. The pig ears are obviously a must have - so perfectly crispy. The croquettes were delicious and not too heavy. For a 1.50, I enjoyed the oysters, fresh clean taste and big and juicy yet still sweet. They looked like Bluepoints, so perfect for the price. The salmon poke was seasoned and accompanied by a non overwhelming sauce, the subtleness of it was really appreciated and it let me appreciate the freshness of the ingredients used. The stuffed dates were also very good, from the bacon, to the Portuguese sausage and the date itself (maybe heavy for some). Finally the drinks here are great as well, the bartenders are all awesome at this spot.",

The dozen oysters were 55 dollars which I thought was too steep, other than that, every bite was a party in my mouth. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, skirt steak, lobster roll, duck fried rice with foie gras, tuna tartare, long clams, and so much more. I would totally come back for their fried rice and try other items that we missed.",

    "text": "Went today for brunch and had a very bad experience.   First and for most, after we were seated at our table nobody acknowledged us. The table next to us were seated after us but got served first, for some reason that same waitress just ignored or didn't acknowledge us. So after we waited for awhile we just asked another waiter to take our order. That waitress didn't apologize for the wait or even made any acknowledgement in regards. And throughout the rest of the meal she pretty much didn't really serve us except bringing out our check and giving us a set of utensils we already said we didn't need...  Second, my hubby ordered an oxtail Benedict and the portion was so tiny! I get that this is a $$$ restaurant and we don't mind paying, but as a brunch dish that oxtail Benedict is not even big enough to feed a kid! For some reason that particular dish is just significantly smaller than other dishes like my duck and waffle (which I gotta say is good but not like excellent). For the price they charge, seriously, at least give us two pieces of bread instead of just one... I mean, are bread and oxtail really that costly...?  Oh, and last but not least, for some reason my duck and waffle came a lot later than hubby's oxtail Benedict and my kid's fat boy hash. My dish basically didn't come out until the rest of my family was done eating. When hubby asked the waitress why my dish was so slow, she simply said they just bring the food out whenever a dish is ready, rather than till all dishes are ready... I don't know, but none of the mid to high end restaurants I went to was like that, your kitchen is supposed to control the timing so that dishes for the entire party (we only had 3 ppl btw) all come out around the same time...  Overall, their food doesn't taste bad, but for that price, you'd expect excellent services, and the amount of food in a brunch dish should at least be of a reasonable size for an average adult. You really can find a lot more better choices on the strip than this place. Hubby was so angry with the experience and the services that he decided not to waste more money there for some average food and bad services so he rather left this place feeling hungry than ordering more stuff. We definitely won't come back!",

The food is fabulous and reasonably priced compared to some other nearby establishments; the drinks are flavorful and strong; and the wait staff is attentive without being intrusive. On the first night we only had 45 minutes to turn the meal around and that was no problem at all. Our waiter expedited the items we ordered and everything came out in plenty of time to be enjoyed at a relaxed pace. Pig ear pad thai, korean bbq ribs, hamachi crudo, waffles and duck confit (with a perfectly runny egg on top), yellowtail collar, octopus - all items we would eagerly order again. Great flavors and a wonderful atmosphere. Order the Basil Quencher with extra lime. It is drink and a half! We will be back here every time we find ourselves at the Venetian/Palazzo. This is a restaurant that serves up memorable food. What a find!",

They usually eat at the Grand Luxe as it is consistent but I encouraged them to try yardbird or Sugarcane. We landed on sugarcane and where we were thoroughly disappointed. Service was great and told it is best family style where we all sample many tapas. Went with Brussels sprouts,  two types of ribs, strip steak, potatoes and slider. The portion sizes were almost laughably small and the slider was literally one slider. Burned to a crisp which explains why it took so long to arrive. It was worse than a microwave white castle. The ribs were descent but the Brussels sprouts (usually my favorite at home in San Diego) were as basic as you can get. The entire experience felt like a joke and I'm dumbfounded at how this place ended up in a 1st tier Hotel like the Venetian.",

Taste great, neatly presented, fair price.   May be I am picky ...  Whatever, the pig ear was more of a disappointment, fry pig ear is just not quite right to us Asian pallet.  The octopus and Korean ribs were fine, not exceptional but fine.  The crab crawl, I think it was frozen, not even half way close to what you get in Key Largo, FL. The really exceptional plate had to be the bone marrow.  It's done right, not just the marrow but with some meat that adds the texture.  This is must have, fair priced and beat Mastro's bone marrow and a few others places.  This is the winner that earned my 4 stars.",

For breakfast, we had the braised beef benedict and avocado toast. The portions and flavors were perfect. We also got to try the vanilla bean beignets which were light and fluffy.  We'll definitely come back to explore the menu more our next time in Vegas.",

The manager even comped a mocktail for our prego friend and made us some delish sample cocktail. It was actually very refreshing and good!!   We sat at the bar and our mixologist was awesome!",

The shrimp was fried on outside and dough not too thick. Both well made. For a tapas place the portion is huge.  I'd say for 2 ladies 3 will do just fine. Service pretty quick and friendly. Give this a try. It's not a bad choice.",

    "text": "Good times at this place. Located in Restaurant row next to the theater.   We wanted to grab a bite because my colleague is obsessed with the Foie Gras Rice here so we sat at the bar to get a few dishes.   I do like the spot and paired with me being hungry I ate everything fairly quickly! We enjoyed the:  - Goat Cheese coquettes. Crunchy breaded outside and plenty of warm cheese in the inside. I loved that it was paired with the guava jam.   -Beef empanada- not your traditional kind as it's more like cross between puff pasty and hard shell for exterior (don't know if that makes sense) but not like think and bready. Just straight up beef so not mixed with veggies. Pairing sauce is a must   -Chimichurri skirt steak- Yes yes and yes   -foie gras fried rice- favors flavorful and different which is why for me I can enjoy it despite not a foie gras fan since it didn't over power the dish.   Staff was excellent and manager checked on us a few times and was a cool guy. I was so full after all of it and had a great time chatting it up with the staff and the guests around me.",

Our waiter was passionate about the food and libations and very knowledgeable. We went tapa style and started with the shrimp ceviche. We have enjoyed different versions all over Florida and make it ourselves but this was absolutely delicious. Definitely going to make this version at home. The Korean short ribs were sliced thin and displayed lengthwise on a colorful platter. Very tender and tangy.  We finished with the Cuban pork. More of the Ybor City style except on an egg based dough that was not crusty like Cuban bread. Mojo style very juicy pork with ham and Swiss or provolone (I forgot), pickle, mustard, and fries.  We were the first in when they opened at 11 and by 11:45, the restaurant was packed out.  I definitely recommend this place for your lunch or dinner stop if you are staying at the Venetian or one of the hotels close by.  It's a little hard to find but just follow the signs for the restaurant row near convention center.  I really appreciate that this restaurant opens early.",

The mustard sauce that came with it was interesting and quite tasty.   The pig ear pad Thai was too crispy for me and a bit too sweet.   The bone marrow was great. The chef did a great job with that dish but it's very rich and filling.   The octopus was good but not great. Some parts were tender while other parts were chewy.   The foie gras fried rice was unique and delicious.   The grilled shrimp was over cooked and barely edible but had a lot of potential.   My sister enjoyed the food a lot more than I did so maybe the food suits her palate more. However, the service was flawless and made for a very enjoyable experience.",

We had trouble scheduling reservations, and I even made a complaint on here about it. Apparently there was a special event the night before that took their phone lines down. Not only were they polite and attentive, they gave us two extra dishes, elote and duck n waffles, for free to make up for the reservation issues. Fun place, would come again.",

A cappuccino took 30 min, and it took them 40 min after we ordered for them to even tell us that they were out of one of the items we ordered. We didn't get our appetizers for 45 min either. When the order came out, the poached eggs were cold (probably not sanitary considering they're still partially raw) and they had gotten one of the dishes wrong. Lastly, we had to ask twice about where the iced latte we ordered was before we got it.  That said, the waitress we had was very helpful and helped flag other people down to figure out where things were. She was friendly and understanding as well.  Bottom line is: if you're looking to waste time milling around and have lots of extra brain space to remember to flag the staff down to follow up on things you've ordered, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "DO NOT sleep on this place!! Accidentally stumbled across this place since Yardbird was booked until 10 pm but we were definitely not disappointed! The food was interesting and on a whole other level. Everything I had here was so good, albeit pricey. But what do you expect in Vegas?  This place is mainly a tapas place, meaning everything is in small portions like appetizers. It's really nice to be able to try a lot of different dishes, especially since they're all so good. We were recommended to get 2-3 dishes per person. keep in mind each dish is $12-$20! We weren't TOO hungry so for a party of five, we ordered 7 dishes and were very satisfied.  Bacon wrapped dates ($16): WOW! This sounds really weird but so good! The bacon was nice and thick and the dates inside had a little touch of sweetness. The dates seemed more like sweet potatoes and the savory flavor of the bacon seeped into the dates. There's also a swoosh of ranch on the plate which pairs really nicely with the savory bacon! This comes with 3 for $16, but we added two more which was an extra $12.   Pig ear pad thai ($14): Mmm so good, they're like candy. This isn't really pad thai at all. It's fried glazed pig ear with some papaya salad and it's stacked nicely. The pig ear was crispy, a little sweet, but also savory. Definitely try this one!  Hamachi crudo ($15): This is probably the best yellowtail I've ever had in my life. Not only was it fresh, but the flavors from the sauce and garnish was really refreshing and brought complexity to a simple fish. Acidic, tangy and fresh!  Wagyu beef carpaccio ($19): Was a little confused on how to eat this since the beef seemed to be all one piece. It was difficult to see where it ended so it got a bit messy. Nevertheless, it was delicious with all the veggies on top. Be warned, it is raw beef so don't order it if you're not okay with that!  Brussels sprouts ($12): I never thought I would like brussels sprouts, but these were cooked so well! They were a little charred on the side, which I think was purposeful because it gave it a nice smokey flavor. Somewhat crispy but also soft on the inside.  Beef short ribs ($21): These were good but nothing to write home about. There wasn't too much meat since most of it was bones.   Goat cheese croquette ($13): This one confused me a bit. The inside is very creamy and thick, a little too thick. There's goat cheese but I wasn't sure what else it was. Not sure if I would recommend this one.   Service was great and they gave a lot of recommendations and answered our questions. Waters were refilled very frequently!",

    "text": "The food here is very impressive. My friends and I were looking for dinner spots and just happened upon SUGARCANE in Restaurant Row in the Venetian. We ordered: bacon wrapped dates, brussel sprouts, hokkaido scallops, japanese pork meatballs, sizzling cast iron wagyu, duck and waffle, and most importantly the torrejas (freaking unbelievable dessert french toast). Another popular dish we didn't get was the goat cheese croquettes.  While every dish was wonderful, the standout dishes were the duck and waffle and the glorious torrejas. I would not be able to describe the deliciousness well with words and is just something you have to experience. The duck and waffle with syrup is perfection and makes fried chicken and waffles look like child's play. The Torrejas made me feel like I had gone to a different world entirely. The taste was just superb and was one of those moments where you take a bite and immediately, your face lights up because it's just that outstanding and indescribable.   The only downsides to this place are a) that it's definitely not super affordable. All of their dishes are tapas style and definitely not a place you go for a great deal and b) clientele (not entirely their control) kind of took away from the experience for our party. The bar has some standing room with a rail behind it separating the seated diners from the bar drinkers. That rail is not particularly sturdy (moved a bit) and some more intoxicated folks kept leaning on the rail and almost spilling their drinks on our table because they used the rail as their drink holder. Another party decided to stand so close to our table on the otherside (away from the rail) that one of their butts was nearly resting on our skillet. We had to ask them to move because it was such unappetizing experience but it would've been nice if the staff could have herded the bar folks back to the bar area (or he burned his butt on our skillet but we felt that might be too awkward and ruin the wagyu).  Most places in Vegas are overpriced (and overhyped) but this is definitely one spot I'd be happy to come back to as long as I request to be seated farther away from the bar!",

I wasn't hungry so I ordered edamame and a glass of Riesling. oh the fries were really good too! Well salted and crispy, so that was a plus. The edamame was ok,  but I had better. The waitress wasn't the most friendliness either, but she tried working with such a large group. The mojito was great with the sugarcane they placed with it. Most people liked their food, but the mimosa was TERRIBLE. The mimosa tastes like plastic. It was disgusting. I literally never had a mimosa taste like that in my life. I truly wish I was exaggerating. Maybe we had a bad batch of champagne, but whatever champagne they used I hope they don't use it ever again. Overall it was cool, but I definitely won't be back. We needed a place that served and at the time since we didn't feel like leaving the Venetian we just found something close. The waitress also was able to spilt our checks, but messed up the payment even though I wrote the amount of the back of the check. Yikes!",

The ingredients were high quality, but it didn't remind enough of a Cuban sandwich from Little Havana in Miami. They should press the sandwich more and it could've used more cheese and mustard. I felt overall the food was good, but could've been better. The service was excellent, and the manager was nice enough to listen to my critique. I appreciate a dining staff that is open-minded and open to critiques.",

I'll start by saying that given the location of the restaurant it is quite pricey and the portions are not very large, so I don't recommend this place if you're looking to stuff for cheap.  Now, getting into the atmosphere of the restaurant it was quite nice. The environment was great! It's not too loud, the wait staff is friendly and quite knowledgeable, there wasn't a strict dress code (I sat down in jeans and a t-shirt), and the service itself was spot on.  There is a great selection of different kinds of food here, so there is a bit for everyone. The plates are family style and meant for sharing, for the most part, so we just ordered a bunch of different things and we all got to try a bit of each. The food was incredible! We ordered a lamb chops dish, some oysters, asparagus, skewered chicken, edamame, mashed potatoes, and a couple of other things. We had not one complaint between any of us about any of it. In fact, the oysters I had there were better than anywhere else I have ever been, and this includes eating them in prestigious restaurants on the CA and ME coasts. Make sure you try the Torrejas \"Bread Pudding\" as well!  You will enjoy this place, as I know we did. Be prepared to receive smaller portions for not a small amount of money, but it's well worth trying this place out. They have a full bar as well so it's a good spot to have a few drinks while you eat as well!",

We had the raw scallop ceviche, goat cheese croquettes, salmon poke, Brussels sprouts, and the tempura shrimp. The goat cheese croquettes were good. The tempura shrimp was our favorite of all the dishes. Beware the salmon poke does not come with rice. It was very tasty, but is just raw salmon on a plate, so I don't think I'd consider that poke. Service was very good. We are on our honeymoon and were given free champagne and dessert. The dessert was the torrejas, which was tasty and I don't even like French toast. Unfortunately though even after all this we left hungry. I won't say don't go here. But just be prepared.",

Jorge, our server, was helpful in recommending some items, as well as explaining one of the best dishes, the Pig Ear Pad Thai.  The tasty pig ears are tossed in a pad thai sauce and served on top of a tiny version of Som Tam (Thai papaya salad).  The flavors are good, though the serving feels so small, lol! We had to order another!  The Bacon Wrapped Dates were also super good, with a decadent aged Spanish cheese sauce on the side, and we enjoyed the goat cheese croquettes, as well.  Prices are a bit high (but you're in Vegas), but the quality and flavors are good.  I'm excited to try some of the ceviche and other fish options when we return in a few weeks!",

We decided to check out Sugarcane. And I am glad we did.  We started off the extravaganza with their signature Seafood Tower: crab legs, lobster, oysters on the half shell and shrimp.  The seafood was fresh and the accompaniments complemented the food quite well. This was a lot of food for 2 people.  My dining companion then ordered some turf: fillet and a couple of other things. His verdict was 2 thumbs up.  The service was friendly, prompt and unintrusive.  I must say that this is a place I will come back to.

Then when bringing us our bill, our server stood at our table as we decided on gratuity.   The food was so so and just not worth it when there are so many other excellent alternative restaurants. Maybe the happy hour is a great deal (we opted for a table over the bar, which disqualified us from happy hour prices).   Good luck. Hope your experience is better than ours was.",

For brunch I was able to customize my avocado toast with scrambled eggs instead of over easy and chose to go with the bottomless Mimosa option which is $25 per person which worked out well since they were $13 apiece. The environment is very relaxed and fun but definitely upbeat. If you decide to try this place definitely go for it's happy hour to get the best bang for your buck!",

The variation and combination of their tapas were very creative.  These are the plates I tried:  Goat Cheese Croquettes- Deep fried cheesy goodness hokkaido scallop with apple, black truffle, lime & jalapeno- this dish stood out the most, because you can taste the freshness of the scallop with enough truffle not to over power the flavor or the apple and lime. Skirt steak chimichurri- this was juicy and flavorful crispy smashed potato- I was imagining mashed potatoes, but what came out were almost like cubes of potatoes covered in parmesan cheese.   The setting is very romantic with the lighting, but also very lively with the servers.  Although the prices of the tapas fairly high, but hey its Vegas!",

We ordered their sesame bombe, since it looked very unique and very tasty, based on the amount of Yelp photos it had. We both liked black sesame, so we gave it a try, and we didn't regret trying it at all. It was very light and fluffy, with the drizzle of black sesame just coating the dessert ever so perfectly. I think that it settled in my stomach quite well, and I felt very satisfied with the dessert afterwards. It definitely satisfied my craving for something sweet - it was just the right amount of sweetness, to be honest with you, and not overpowering at all.  To me, the sesame bombe is one of the dishes that makes this place stand out from the rest at the Strip. For a price of $12, the portion size could have been a bit bigger, but hey, you're in Vegas, so you pay for both the dessert and ambiance. Not to mention that it's located in a popular hotel too (The Venetian)!",

In general, ingredients are fresh, flavors very bold, the food is Caribbean / Asian via South America, all prettied up the chic Miami way.  Small plates to share dining concept.    Tip:  Ask the server how many pieces come with each order.  They can make adjustments for your party size.  Straight up, pass the traditional raw bar offerings.  Boring and in the case of the oysters, grossly overpriced ($28/half dozen; $54/dozen).  Instead focus on the crudos.  The Hokkaido scallop (A slice of scallop surrounds apple, topped with the tiniest bit of black truffle and sliver of jalapeno then finished with a squeeze of lime) oozes sweet scallop flavor.  The kombu (dried kelp) marinated fluke (gentle slices of fluke prepared between then sat atop kombu topped with slivered grapes and toasted sesame), delicate with a gentle umami finish from the natural glutamates in the konbu.  Finally an intriguing lamb tartare merguez.  Great use of the classic spices and heat usually found in the sausage, it's flavors rounded out by eggplant \"caviar\", shaved veg, and the acidic vibrancy of pickled mustard seeds.  Warm dishes, do not pass on the uni and avocado toast.  Radish adds texture, cilantro, herbaceousness.  Creamy, rich, seafood goodness.  Wow.  The pig ear pad thai, a salad of perfectly cooked slivered pig ears with a papaya salad, all kinds of good.  The smoked fish dip and goat cheese croquettes with quince marmalade both very good as well.  Sadly, items from the open fire grill are far less impressive.  The Spanish octopus, tender leg, finished and charred on the open fire, is the standout.  Sweet that turns bitter complexity on the finish plus a great aroma to boot.  The lamb chops, though properly cooked is pedestrian.  The grilled shimeji mushrooms, over dressed with a sticky, sweet soy sauce that all but obliterates their flavor.  The grilled Okinawan sweep potatoes, so charred it has a pronounced astringent finish.    Service is surprisingly good despite the newness of the restaurant.  Friendly and efficient.  Good craft cocktail program.  OK wine program.  In the end, food ranging the gamut of delicate and subtle to in your face bold needs nothing more that the perfect, bone dry, gin martini.  Highs and lows but ultimately a great addition to the Venetian's restaurant collection.",

    "text": "I likened my experience here to the first time I ate at the bizarre in Los Angeles, but way better. I don't know what the hell the chefs are up to, but they are literally creating magic. Pure magic that explodes inside my mouth, every time I took another bite of their ridiculously amazing food.   Best meal maybe I've ever had. We ordered 5 plates and each one legit, got better than the next. Brussel sprouts. Who ever likes these?!! The way they made them; they tasted like delicious chicken. Potato things.. amazing. Bacon wrapped dates?!?! OMFG heaven.  Short ribs. Excellent. Burrata salad. Fabulous. Ahhhh everything was on another level. Please keep up this consistency. So rare to find.   Staff. We had a super pretty, cool and cute waitress that helped my friend and I in the back. I will be back this week and for my birthday. 5 stars all around and on every level. Couldn't be happier I've found my new favorite restaurant.",

Update:  Had brunch at SUGARCANE this morning. Geez. Mimosas and Fast Boy Hash. Top freaking notch. Dean was great as well. Really made us feel at home",

My fiance who was not in a diet enjoyed his burger as well. Can't wait to try this spot out again but enjoy all the sauces and flavors with it!",

I was so impressed with everything I ordered.   The goat cheese balls are to die for. It doesn't look as good as it tastes! Not that presentation is lacking, but you just don't know what's in those balls until you've eaten one!!   The octopus.. a little expensive for one skewer of grilled octopus, but still AMAZING. I only wish there was more.   The skirt steak with chimichurri- amazing. I'm sure you've had plenty of steak and chimichurri. Pretty standard right?  No! Try this one!!   The balsamic strawberry (less sweet) - if you're not into sweet drinks like me, tell the server and they'll come back with the most refreshing vodka drink ever!!   Lastly, the maple apple French toast with cinnamon ice cream. AMAZING. I can't even begin.  I'm not even a fan of warm cooked apples and I loved this dessert.   Service was great, I can't complain. Our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I dined here the first week they were open and was really blown away by the food, service and bar. The space is so welcoming and cozy different than what i have seen in Las Vegas. The music they were playing felt like miami and was at the perfect volume. You can hold a conversation and also keep an upbeat vibe.   Ok so lets get right into this review and start with the bar. Finally a great Mojito in Las Vegas! Wow, the perfect amount of sweetness mint and lime. Im not sure what rum they were using that day but exceptional Bravo! Tobacco old fashioned was a fantastic twist on a classic and I loved it. I dont know any Bars in Vegas that have such a strong rum game. The drinks are really that good.    THE FOOD! wow!! From the moment the first bite hit my lips I knew I was in for an amazing experience. I think we started with a couple of Crudos as recommended by our server. I cant imagine a better way to start a meal than with fresh raw fish prepared many different ways. We had ceviches, a scallop on a piece of apple topped with truffle, beautiful taste and presentation. We had many hot plates. The menu is tapas style so its nice to be able to order different plates and really make your way down the menu.  The Duck and Waffles are just perfection, do me a favor and remove all the meat from the duck leg, put it on top of the waffle,   pour the maple syrup over it place the egg on top pop the yolk and eat. youll thank me later! Other plates we tried were: Foie Gras Bastilla, Bone Marrow, Sea Urchin Avocado Toast, Pig Ear Padthai and Fall Pumpkin and duck. Im sure there are others I am forgetting to mention..We were a group of 5 large guys so we got to try many of the plates and each one was great.   The service was on point. everyone was friendly, attentive, but the best thing for me was the staffs knowledge of the menu! any question I asked I got an immediate answer, no having to go and ask or check with the chef. The moment your glass needed water or your Drink was running low someone would fill it or ask if you needed another cocktail which was nice.   I have dined at many Vegas restaurants and at this moment Sugarcane is top of the list. The food is fantastic, well priced and the drinks are well made. The ambiance is relaxed and the decor is very inviting. Many Vegas restaurants can seem uninviting, intimidating and cold Sugarcane keeps it warm, inviting and tasty!  I had a smile on my face the whole time i was there. What more could you ask for? Try and save some room for dessert its great.   If your in Vegas go eat at Sugarcane You wont regret it.",

The staffs were professional and friendly. All the tapas were delicious, but slightly on the salty side for me and my boyfriend so we drank more water than we usually do. All the hot foods came out really hot and cold foods really cold which is a thumb up from me. A few of their tables are pretty low; if you are there to indulge their good foods and don't want your backs to feel tired at the end, ask for regular height tables.",

The menu looked great and the hostess was happy to seat us. Our waitress was sweet. All down hill from there. 1) It took really long to get our food--I mean really long. We ordered the beignets when we ordered our drinks and then ordered our breakfasts when the drinks were delivered. The beignets were slow but we were chill about it. Our breakfasts took so long we considered leaving. I wish we had. 2) None of us thought our breakfast was good. The bacon was so hard it was ridiculous--not crispy but hard. Eggs were overcooked. Food was not hot, just barely warm. \"Specialty dishes\" were just okay. The food temp didn't help. We all thought it probably sat under warmers for a while. Getting the check and paying was another frustratingly long process. And really overpriced for what we had (and we have no problem spending $ on food/drinks). We still tipped 20% because our waitress was nice and I spent a lot of years in the business, but we would never go back.",

The wait staff are all super attentive, friendly, and super knowledgeable.  Devorah, the manager quickly came to my rescue with a desperately needed pen and paper (you saved me!) For two, we shared hamachi crudo, bacon wrapped dates, pig ear pad thai, Thai shortribs and the lamb chops.  Every dish was excellent, well flavored, and DIFFERENT (some times this sort of mixed item menu suffers from sweet soy flavors on just about everything).  Each dish was tastier than the next and portions were decent size, not small.  In terms of cocktails,   I ordered the rum Old Fashioned from the menu which was excellent.  Upon finishing our waiter recommended the smoked orange peel Rum Manhattan which was not on the menu- smoky and unique.  Maybe there is a whole \"secret\" cocktail menu? Hmmm.. will definitely inquire on my next trip to Vegas and will CERTAINLY return to Sugarcane.  Last but definitely not least, I should also mention that this restaurant is well priced for Vegas and the quality of the experience.",

It is a tapas sharing concept and we tried a number of the dishes on the menu. They were all terrific but the stars of menu where the pig ear Pad Thai and the Korean style beef short ribs. The grilled dishes are expertly cooked on a wood fired open grille which just takes things to another level. Between the char from the wood fired grille, the sauce and the chilies the short ribs were out of this world. For dessert we had the Torrejas which was delicious, I especially liked the cinnamon ice cream that accompanies it. The restaurant is well put together and has a great vibe. Their music mix was terrific and just added to an already good energy this place has. To round out a totally amazing experience the service was outstanding! We have dined at more expensive and lavish restaurants and not had this level of service! Everyone from our server Kennith to the manager to the support staff were attentive and worked seamlessly. Fortunately they are open till 2am so the next evening after our bar hoping we ended up here at 1am to have our two favorite dishes we craved. What a great way to close out the night.",

I made a reservation with open table which was fine but they have two entrances and there's only one hostess and if you come in the wrong entrance like I did she's easy to miss so we had to seats ourselves. Not a big deal really but just an observation. We had the sliders and collapse the rules and smash potatoes they were OK nothing special just a little something to pass some time. They brought us the wrong drinks and when it was  time for the check he brought me one receipt with an amount of $56 and then after charging it ithe second receipt for 86$. And then he tells me oh it's just an authorization to be charged but of course being the skeptic that I am I checked my account and of course they charge me twice",

Would recommend the bacon wrapped dates.  The cauliflower soup was ok but preferred the bone marrow and the eggplant more.  The desserts were really amazing.  Had the sesame cake and the Nutella sundae.  The service was fast and friendly.  The only compliant is the price for the amount of food, which is expected from a small plates restaurant on the Strip.  The dessert is probably the best for the price.  Be prepared to spend a lot if you are hungry.",

Our waiter was pleasant but didn't really seem to know the menu.  A couple of plates we ordered never made it to the table.  We asked about the portion size on a couple of dishes and he got them wrong.  Standouts on the food were the sweet corn with the chipotle mayo, the sweet potato with maple soy and walnuts and the Korean fried chicken.  Cauliflower soup was blah, the beef sliders are over priced at $8 an individual slider, as is the shrimp cocktail, which at $9 a piece were bland and served with 2 uninspired sauces.  For a restaurant with a Caribbean flair the specialty cocktail list was boring. They do however have an extensive rum list for people who are a fan of rum.",

I hate to say, I forgot our waiters name, he was awesome.  He wears a perfect Mohawk.  The waiter gave unsurpassed customer service.  He provided a plethora of information of the city. Although my husband and I have been to Sin city many times, with no two times ever being the same, he provided even more suggestions and information of activity's and sights. He also knew the menu like the back of his hand. I also listened to him interact with guest around me.  My husband had the Oxtails with a poached egg.  The meat was very well seasoned and tender. He became a Fan.  I experienced the simple waffles and fresh fruit, with a side, over medium egg. There was nothing simple about the perfectly fresh fruit that covered my delectable waffles. I would tell anyone to go by and enjoy the experience.",

The sense of disorientation evident with most of the staff during my time here may be due to this little incidental. That being said, the bartenders I interacted with had a good attitude in general and avoided getting flustered easily, as far as I could tell. And if one is looking for fine rum cocktails and is nearby, this place is surely a solid choice. The Tobacco rum Old-Fashioned is simple in its classic presentation yet original enough to stand out of the crowd. It's my favorite of what I had here. The Hemingway had a fine presentation indeed, but was a bit too tart IMO. And the Rum n Bramble and the Beet Mojito were decent choices; yet they seemed a tad too similar in taste to each other. Still, the atmosphere here was inviting during my stay; and the rum cocktails were this place's redeeming quality in the end.",

The place looks stunning with a view of the kitchen from the dinning area.  They were really courteous and understanding with the amount of people there. They had specialty fruity drinks, but no one was really impressed with them. We split the group in 2 tables and ordered food family style for each table. Our table took a plate each to share and I think we could have ordered a few more plates to complete the meal as I was left not fully satisfied after the meal, but still feeling full (weird, I know).   The goat cheese croquettes were good (basically small fondue parmesan if you are french like me) and everything with meat in it was cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor. Most of the vegetable dishes were also pretty good, I pretty much can't recall any average plate. My friend is a very picky oyster eater and she was really impressed with their quality. We also tried the Pig Ear Pad Thai and it was really good, basically tasted like chips but better.  Overall, family style food are my favorite types of restaurant and this is a good one. Most of the plates were delicious and I would go there again.",

My husband finally got manager's attention who immediately took our order and threw in several freebies.  Now the food itself was uniquely prepared, fresh and full of flavor.  Not all the dishes were favorites but they were all memorable.  Brussel sprouts was artfully prepared with ponzu topped with citrus.  Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with sausage was too chewy and sweet but I appreciate the attempt.   Goat cheese croquettes were simple & delightful.  The wagyu carpaccio was disappointing as they topped it with too much sauce and greens to taste the meat.  Pig Ear Pad Thai was sweet crunchy bits on top of perfectly pickled papaya salad.",

The Spice of Love drink was tasty but didn't blow me away.   The dishes were just ok. The scallop dish on the crudo menu was the only dish I enjoyed. It was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. Burrata salad and cauliflower soup were my least favorite dishes.   Our server was excellent. He was very friendly, explained the entire menu and recommended dishes.   I made a reservation on Open Table and received a call from the restaurant the morning of confirming my reservation. I called right back and spoke to the hostess to confirm. When my husband and I arrived, the hostess said we didn't have a reservation. I told her someone called me to confirm and she seemed clueless. She sat us anyways. Side note - you get dinged on open table and they will cancel your account if you miss more than 3 reservations.   This looks like a good place to pop into if you don't have reservations and just want a few appetizers.",

Shouldn't the server know who ordered what instead of standing at one end of the table and yelling to see who had the lamb? My friend ordered a drink at the beginning of the meal and never received it. To put a cherry on top of the horrible Sundae, we found out that we \"couldn't\" split our 11 person tab. This is 2018... how can you not be able to split a tab? This restaurant was completely ridiculous and the hugest joke I've ever been too.",

It's hard to get a table depending on the time of the day and if you don't have a reservation. Luckily my colleagues and I were able to get seated immediately for a group of 7 and the hostesses were more than helpful to accommodate for the large party.   This place serve tappas (small plates) so its meant to be shared with others. Foods that we ordered were: Hamachi Crudo, pig ear pad thai, duck waffle confit, foi gras fried rice, chicken lettuce wraps, bone marrow, angus sliders, japanese eggplant, and spanish octopus.   The Foi gras fried rice, pig ear pad thai and the hamachi were my favorites by far. The pig ear is nice and crunchy, and you just want to keep eating it cause of those sweet and sour notes. The hamachi was really fresh. The foi gras fried rice smelled savory and the buttery fat of the foi gras made the rice taste really nice. Everything else was really nice too but to sum it up, everything here is pretty solid. You will def have a good time here",

The only item we liked was the hamachi crudo. Everything else tasted way off. All of the protein dishes were bad due to the quality of meat. The brussel sprouts were burnt and tasted bitter.

The  food is made to order so it may have just a little bit of wait time but nothing good comes cheap or fast !  Raquel our waitress did an excellent job of explaining everything we were ordering and gave spot on recommendations that my family might enjoy.  This adventure we decided to devour :  Hokkaido Scallops - Delicious , light and although I was hoping for a little bit more Scallop flavor  to come through the pairing of all the items complimented the overall taste Blue Fin Tuna Tartare-Very nice mild flavor and buttery tuna that felt like it just melted in your mouth Salmon Poke- Good , cost effective but I should have stuck with all the signature dishes.  I would have to say if you are bringing a date and want to impress them with the restaurant environment without breaking the bank, this is what to order.  Familiar and inexpensive with great taste. Harissa beets- I must admit I did not try it only so that I could get the feedback from my family. Let's just say that if anyones hand was close by the dish it would have been taken right off.  Days later and still the beets were a conversation piece.  YUP.. Beets.. Goat Cheese Croquettes-  I would also recommend this one as a Date night not break the bank dish.  Great sweet and savory pairing with a  light crunch.   Sea Urchin and Avocado toast -  LOL I knew it was gonna be good just from reading the title of the item on the menu.  How can you go wrong with the buttery flavor of Sea Urchin and the smooth silky flavors of the avocado? It was a match made in heaven !  All the flavors came through like polite guests at a dinner party.  Ahhh.. a taste of Sea Urchin, slightly nutty and buttery then it's guest avocado shows up LOL.. ok ok.. getting off track.. This dish was pretty damn good and I would.. let me rephrase.. I WILL order it again the next time I come. Foie gras bastilla-  Holy cow, you hear about this kinda stuff on the food channel but never really thought it would appeal to me as something I might crave.   Close your eyes and imagine.. light , crispy, delicate .. smooth creamy flavors as soon as you bite and that will be the Foie gras bastilla.   In layman's terms, this stuff be like CRACK !  Very addicting and I should have ordered more.  Here's a tip.. If you get this dish make sure to eat it WITH the edible flowers.  whoahhh..  In essence , you come to this place to enjoy the atmosphere, great taste and excellent employees who in my opinion were very attentive, professional and knowledgable.  If you stumble upon this GREAT establishment and think you can order an 0.89 Happy meal you are sorely mistaken.  This is NOT a buffet, this is NOT Mcdonalds, you are paying for an experience with professionals who treat their food like art.  Oh.. and although they have a large plate area of the menu this is a Tapas(small plate for sharing) restaurant.  Try to do a little research before going to a restaurant. It would be like me going into an Indian restaurant and being mad that they didn't have burgers on the menu then complaining on yelp about it.  Silly huh.. yep..",

The decor made the restaurant feel kinda casual but the pricing on the menu is more business casual /upscale. I would say 2-4 tapas plates per person with the bill average about $50 person (with a cocktail) It's a but loud as well with music playing but it's actually great music we found ourselves dancing and singing along a few times!   Drinks: -Spice of Love 3/5  -Strawberry Balsamic 4/5 -Old Fashioned 1/5  Food: -Goat cheese croquettes 3/5 (not a fan of goat cheese personally but everyone else really enjoyed it) -Bacon wrapped dates 5/5 (don't really like dates but it was bacon wrapped, thick cut bacon and it was crispy, and stuffed with sausage. It was delicious with that salty sweet combination.) -Brussels sprouts 4/5 (made with an orange glaze/soy sauce)  -Pig ear pad thai 2/5 (never had ear pigs it was good but only have it a 2 because I was not a fan of the pad thai sauce) -Hokkaido Scallops 3/5 (3/5 per my co-workers) I don't eat seafood  -Harissa beets 1/5 I don't like beets but tried the dish. Nope still don't like beets...beets themselves always taste to earthy for me...like dirt. Nothing against this dish, just do not like beets. My co-workers that like beets said it would be 4/5.  -Duck and Waffle 4/5 This was a nice twist on chicken and waffles. Nice crispy leg/thigh of the duck w/ a buttery waffle and sunny side egg on top. Oh and the maple syrup...out of this world! I'd put that on everything!  -Chicken thighs 4/5 Very tasty. Their take on lettuce wraps. The seasoning on the chicken with yummy. I just wish you get more but I guess that's why it's tapas style.  -Skirt steak 4/5 The steak was tender and grilled well. The chimichurri sauce made the dish.  -Sweet Corn 5/5 This was my 2nd favorite dish. Sweet corn, full of flavor, and just a hint of spice.  -Torrejas 5/5 This was AMAZING! \"Bread pudding\" chunks with caramelized apples in a honey butter maple sauce with a cinnamon ice cream on the side...oh boy...I'd go back there just for this dessert!",

I'll go through our orders now:  Pig ear Pad Thai- Solid dish, the flavors were nice and this had a nice blend of sweetness from the papaya salad.   Thai Style Pork Ribs- The best dish we had- very flavorful and tender. Would get this again for sure.  Spanish Octopus- It could have used a bit more char. Decent flavor but I've had much better.  Yellowtail Collar- I wasn't a fan of this; not necessarily because of the taste, but more due to the portion sizing and it was slightly overcooked.  Beef short ribs (Korean style)- Go to any Korean BBQ place and these are pretty much the exact same. These weren't different than anything I have had before. This did have the best value at this restaurant, though.   All in all, I've had much better. I like the concept a lot (small plates/slightly upscale), but the flavors weren't there and I thought that none of these dishes really stood out in any way, shape, or form. Sushi Samba in the Venetian is superior for similar prices.",

    "text": "All of my Yelp friends who have been to SUGARCANE Raw Bar and Grill had given them 5 stars and I COMPLETELY AGREE!!   SUGARCANE Raw Bar and Grill is located in Restaurant Row between Venetian and Palazzo, closer to the Venetian. I would recommend getting a reservation no matter what time you come here because we came before lunch time on a Tuesday and there were no tables available. Luckily there were seats available at the bar.   The menu here is made to be shared. From the Crudos section, we had the Hamachi Crudo ($17). From the Hot Kitchen section, we had the Bacon Wrapped Dates ($17) and the Bone Marrow ($18). From the Open Fire Grill section, we had the Spanish Octopus ($18).   Hamachi Crudo - Thin slices of Hamachi with serrano onion relish, sea asparagus and Japanese chili lime and soy sauce. The Hamachi was very fresh and was a nice raw touch to complement the rest of our order.   Bacon Wrapped Dates - Huge juicy bacon wrapped dates compared to the ones that I have seen at other tapas places. It came with some fresh greens on top and a smear of an aged Spanish cheese.   Bone Marrow - This order of Bone Marrow was larger than what we imagined. The large bone marrow was topped with sweet braised cheek and 4 large slices of bread. I usually see bone marrow as a not-so-filling item since it it usually served with only bone marrow and small crostinis, but this order could easily be a full meal. It was incredible rich and fatty, so if you get this item, I recommend some other acidic or fresh items to complement your meal.   Spanish Octopus - This is probably the item that I liked the least by compare. I just feel like it wasn't good value. This was basically one octopus tentacle grilled and topped with red chili sauce.   I highly recommend SUGARCANE Raw Bar and Grill!! I admit it was well on the pricey side, but the quality and experience was definitely worth it for me.",

    "text": "We had just left a concert at the Venetian Theatre and spotted this restaurant on the way out.  We wanted something light since it was late in the evening.    Its not a large space and is just of the beaten path of the other Canal Shoppes, but looked inviting with a well stocked bar and well presented raw bar.  The specialty cocktails looked great and priced in line with other strip venues.  I stuck with the house Manhattan which did not disappoint.  I really wanted the oysters but at $55/dozen looked for other options.  We started with the bone marrow and empanadas.  The bone marrow was tender and juicy since they incorporated cheek into the mix.  The empanadas were crisp and flavorful.  Before going on, a huge Shout out to our server Adrian, we has very attentive and all his suggestions were right on point.  We continued with the Skirt steak and Chimichurri which was cooked to our liking and again seasoned well.  We closed with the Thai Crab Cakes.  The Crab Cakes were more crab than filler which is always a plus.  The Thai sauce was good, a bit sweet for my taste, but a good accompaniment.  My only gripe is that they had a DJ, which was so odd because its NOT a huge bar, and there is no dance floor.  The music was LOUD, so if were not for the great food and service we would have left.  If you want good food and service priced right then Sugarcane is worth a visit, but if the DJ is in the house and you are not ready to have to yell at your guests, find something else more suitable.   Food and Service rate a 5, but the DJ and Loud music knock it down a couple of notches.",

In general, SUGARCANE does a good job with seafood in various forms, along with other tapas-like presentations -- other highlights were the Brussels sprouts and the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. We enjoyed a seafood tower as well, which was a fun diversion, if not particularly noteworthy.   Prices are in line with the Strip, but certainly not a great value compared with similar restaurants in other cities. SUGARCANE is not a bad choice, but not a showstopper either.",

I like that it doesn't give you a feeling of being rushed, out server and host were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   We had crispy pig ear salad (I will order a double next time and enjoy it with a beer )   The truffle toad in the hole was a awesome breakfast item. Nice slab of brioche and truffle aroma   Shrimp ceviche with passion fruit aji was so refreshing our palates were definitely dancing.   I could go on but I think i painted a good picture of the place.   Thank you!!",

We then went to the heirloom tomato burrata, bland at first, after adding a little salt this dish became the star of the show (highly recommend) mozzarella was perfect, dish was balanced. Finished with the short ribs, overcooked which made it chewy with a forward charcoal ash flavor, sauce was way too sweet for me, the kimchi pickles were full of flavor and the best part of the dish could have used triple the amount to balance the sweet sauce. Plenty of options, i may give it another shot but lots to choose from around here and may run out of time.",

    "text": "Amazing.  Located in Restaurant Row in the Venetian, SUGARCANE simultaneously blends in while sticking out: you're usually on the way to somewhere else and might not be looking, but the clear and windowless view into the dining areas as well as the hostess stationed at the very front are unmistakable.   I was feeling the menu, so I stopped by SUGARCANE after a long day in Vegas. The hostess was very nice and sat me at a table next to the hallway, and I began to pore over the menu. There was just so much to consider and so many different permutations--tapas and a big plate? Maybe just a bunch of tapas? Had no idea.  Luckily, the waitress came along and I was able to ask her for recommendations. She also asked if I wanted some edamame, and of course I did! I didn't realize they would be $7, but I ended up really happy because they were supremely delicious--the spice on the outside with the roast from the grill and the squeeze of the lime was awesome if not slightly lip-burning.  Ultimately, I decided to get the pig ear pad thai along with the beef bone marrow. The pig ear pad thai was honestly not really much like a pad thai and was more of a papaya salad; its flavor was great, and the pig ears were nicely crisped to contrast with the pickled vegetables.   The beef bone marrow was huge and definitely could have fed two. The beef was incredibly rich and flavorful and almost overwhelming--in a good way. The bread was incredibly buttered and also rich, so in all I felt like the dish was almost bordering on too much. However, it tasted great, and I would just recommend to pace it with the greens on the dish as well as any other sides you have.  Overall, a truly great meal and tastes I will never forget. Would love to come back.",

Thank goodness we chose Sugarcane. The tapas-like dishes were light and the flavors were fresh and bright. We ordered the lamb chops, seasonal mushrooms and hamachi over apples. The hamachi was probably one of our favorite dishes of the weekend, but the seasonal mushrooms were also a stand-out.   The drinks were also a hit. I LOVED my drink - Leche de Tigre (Pisco, coconut milk, yuzu, simple syrup and cilantro). My BF also really his Spice I'd Love (vodka, jalapeno, passion fruit, and mango).   All in all, it's the perfect place to stop for a bite if you need to take a break from the heavy indulgences.",

Providing such poor service while charging such high prices is unacceptable.  The very high priced small plates were all average nothing was special except the scallops. They were marvelous.  I am more than happy to pay high prices for average food if the service is impeccable. There are too many wonderful places in Vegas so you don't need to waste your money here.",

    "text": "Located in Venetian/Palazzo Hotel. I was drawn by the Happy Hour sign! The host answered my questions and said Happy Hour is only offered at the bar.   They had amazing offerings such as their Raw Oysters! Everywhere you go in this town, everything is overpriced if you're used to the average prices in the South, so Happy Hour is heaven! Oysters in Vegas are never cheap. But here at Sugarcane, Happy Hour oysters are $1.50 each (6 min)! That's ok bc I was craving some oysters! I ordered half a dozen, my friends also ordered half a dozen, and then I paired them with Rosemary Fries ($6).  First impression: dimly lit back bar with modest dining area. Since it was an hour before happy hour ended, it wasn't that busy. Felt like the only 4 ppl there. Host seemed a little annoyed about me asking too many questions, so when she motioned me to sit at the bar, she didn't hand me any menus.   Service: We sit at the bar and then the bartender gives us both the happy hour and drink menus. They didn't seem thrilled about us ordering water and happy hour options. Initially, I wanted to go there to have a snack before dinner. I get it, it's a well-known place and we're sitting at a bar ordering water. Lighten up!   What was weird is that they didn't mention our oysters would be combined. So when they arrived, my friend who ordered with me changed seats so we can eat next to each other. We ended up sharing anyway. Oysters came with only cocktail sauce, so we asked for Tobasco sauce. Bartender was kind enough to offer horseradish too.   Food: Oysters were small but packed with flavor! It was chucked beautifully and tasted so fresh. They hit the spot. I only wished I had ordered a dozen for myself. Wish I knew what type of oyster they were. They're different from the usual large ones I get in FL. Rosemary Fries was a large portion topped with shredded cheese and fried rosemary, and I wasn't complaining! So good!  Overall: oysters were a steal! And the fries were so yummy! I'd go back for just the Happy Hour. They have other interesting options for $. From what I read on Yelp, the rest of the regular menu (including the oysters) is tripled the price.",

    "text": "I must admit, we are in Vegas a lot, probably too much. We try just about every restaurant at out home away from, at Palazzo/Venetian. For whatever reason we have been skipping over Sugarcane and that was a mistake!  Why to go...music on the louder side which we liked, cool decor with open feel being right in the main walk way between the hotels, and the best part was the food!  The Dates stuffed with Spanish sausage wrapped in bacon were a nice twist on the typical version with cheese. I liked this version way more, especially since it was less dates which meant just the right amount of sweet. The Goat Croquettes went perfect with a nice glass of red wine. The Pig Ear Pad Thai dish was the closest flavors of Thailand since we were there, so good we got it twice, and the second one we asked to be extra spicy.   Sugarcane has made the cut, and is now in our rotation, too bad we waited so long.",

Cappuccino was decently flavored but lacked the decorative touch...  Shrimp ceviche oddly had no liquid, no citrus... Seemed quite fresh however so that's a plus..   The main negative was fat boy hash. Portion as small and honestly the entire dish tasted like it was doused in \"truffle\" flavor. The size is excusable because they brand themselves as \"tapas\" (at full meal prices), but that means the dish has to be on point. Today it was not.  I didn't taste the dates so cannot comment.  2 coffee drinks, wrapped dates, 2 breakfasts and ceviche fed 2 and came to $105 all included, we were better fed for half the price at Ramsay burger.",

We went on a Monday and kinda early as we were feeling the effects of a 3am wake up to make the flight - so it was quiet but that also meant super attentive, fast service.  The dishes are mainly designed to be served tapas style with 2/3 dishes recommended per person so it's a great opportunity to explore the menu!  Some dishes were that good we had to repeat: Octopus was best I have ever had - cooked perfectly with a delicious lightly curried sauce , we also went with doubles of the scallop with compressed apple and a second go round of the ceviche with red snapper. It was seasonal with yams and corn ... and believe me it works!!   We also enjoyed shrimp, street corn which was delicious and the tuna tartare which the kids devoured!!  The food is just delicious, service impeccable, an amazing start to our vacation!",

The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The contract and payment process went smoothly.  They wait weeks while I got the restaurant set up as a vendor in our system and then waited weeks more to get payments done.   For the event itself, we had the left side of the restaurant to ourselves with two bar areas and passed food.  I choose these appetizers below and everything was really tasty.  We had plenty to eat and drink.    1) salmon poke hijiki seaweed, sesame & soy - I even liked this and I don't normally like salmon or raw stuff. 2) skirt steak chimichurri - tasty steak, tender, yum! 3) avocado toast charred corn, whipped goat cheese - so good!  4) Japanese fried chicken sriracha aioli, scallions - I did not get to try this one but everyone liked it.  5) goat cheese croquettes, membrillo marmalade - so good as well!  So overall a great event.  Fun place, good food, very helpful staff.",

Of all of their drinks my favorite was the Strawberry Balsamic because I'm not a heavy drinker when I dine out and it was a good blend of light/tart which went well with the small plates my group shared.  If you were to ask me what kind of food they serve though I honestly don't know what my answer would be because they have the most random assortment of dishes but everything that I tried was simply yummy. It wasn't too elegant that I felt my wallet hurt but wasn't so basic that I felt like I was overpaying; it hit the spot perfectly after a long day at work. If you're on the North-side of the Strip, I would definitely come back for their happy hour or maybe stop by for the Venetian Foodie Tour.  My highlight was that sweet corn because I love elote a lot-e.",

We wanted to grab a relatively quick breakfast before going into the exhibit. The line to get in to the Starbucks or the other coffee shop was at least 20 minutes long. And no seating in either one. Sugarcane was open despite the early morning hour. And lots of empty tables. Just a little hesitation on going into a place that calls itself a raw bar to eat breakfast ( which might explain the empty tables). But to my surprise they had a brunch menu that did not require eating anything Raw! And no wait for a table. We were seated immediately. And almost just as fast our server, Dean, appeared at the table to take our beverage order. My wife and I decided to share the toad in a hole and the avocado toast. The toad in a hole was a large piece of very thick bread with an over easy egg in the center. The bread was lightly toasted with melted cheese and honey on it. That was absolutely spectacular. The avocado toast was also quite good. An excellent choice for a fairly healthy light breakfast.",

I called him back over right away and he swears up and down I only put $60 in there. WOW never in my life! I complained and did get $20 back the next with out even an apology from manager. Never again!!  The food was sub par, medicore. Not worth the money at all. $14 for some bland fried potatoes?",

    "text": "Absolutely five star rate. We came here for 2 nights in a row. They serve perfect drinks. To add flavor to the drinks, beef short ribs (Korean style) is the perfect combination. The sweet and salty taste makes you want to drink more and more. We have tried several drinks here. Strawberry balsamic which is kind of sour, but the fresh fruit taste still provides a nice taste. I personally like garden essence a lot, because the basil and black pepper provide a lavender taste. Spice of love is my friend's  favorite because it has mango and passion fruit taste in it. Tobacco Rum old fashioned and basil quencher are also worth trying.  For the beer, I recommend Delirium because it is 17 proof and has a nice alcohol taste. The servers have passion and are humorous as well. Definitely 5 star.",

They are saying the opioid crisis is out of control in America, for generations woman and their shopping addiction has been the real disease and we have yet to find a cure; and it's draining our bank accounts exponentially!?!  All the shopping at the The Grand Canal Shoppes worked up an appetite, so enter SUGARCANE Raw Bar Grill.  We came here looking to grab a small bite of Bone Marrow, but you know how that goes!?!  Come for the Bone Marrow but stay for everything else, cuz we obese Americans and we can't help ourselves.  This is what we chowed down on:  Report Card:  Kale and Apple Caesar Salad  A The baby mama loved it, I didn't even get to even try a bite so I guess I can say it was b o m b.  Sweet Corn B+ The flavor was on point but the corn had some super burned areas.  Tempura Rock Shrimp A+ Shrimp lovers, this is a must order!  Crispy Smashed Potato A- Cooked really well and the spicy mayo was a perfect pairing with the potatoes.  Bone Marrow B We came here for the bone marrow but it was a little two sweet, had a lot better elsewhere, also there was only one piece :(  The Venetian Hotel's most underrated restaurant in my opinion. Yes there's Yardbird and Chica but Sugarcane provides something a lil bit different and I like it, I like it a lot.  I can't wait to come back here and try more of their tapas items!",

On this occasion, we had kale & apple Caesar salad; tempura rock shrimp, beef short ribs; bone-in dry aged ribeye; and crispy smashed potatoes.  The star of the evening was the ribeye. It was cooked to perfection and full of flavor.  Unlike the other dishes, this was a 24oz cut and plenty to share for a party of 4.  The Caesar salad and  tempura rock shrimp were also amazing.  The salad had just enough dressing and the veggie and apple were fresh.  The batter on the tempura shrimp was light and flavorful.  The smashed potatoes are delicious.  Our least favorite dish was the short ribs.   Made Korean style, there wasn't a whole lot of meats to extract off the bone.  Flavor was good though.   Overall, this place is a solid 4 stars.  It is pricey but the atmosphere and food is great.  I highly recommend.",

We occupied three tables and I think everyone was loving every dish.   The food tasted fresh and served hot and delicious.  Since I have been on a low carbohydrate diet, I just tasted the dessert, but ate the protein dishes to my heart content.  I would come back and bring my wife to experience the various dishes and flavourful dishes on our next trip to Las Vegas.  That is my standard, if my experience is good enough to bring my wife back to experience.  This restaurant hit that high mark.",

We enjoyed the shrimp ceviche, raw oysters, steak & frites, and added a poke bowl because we were really hungry. Everything was flavorful and the food came out fast. We also enjoyed the drinks!

Happy Hour is only served at the bar, fortunately there were 2 seats left and I grabbed them! They need to expand the seating for HH, as it's almost impossible for parties greater than 2 and I heard other people complaining about this. High top table seating near the bar should be available in complete fairness for groups to partake.   We ordered the oysters which were delicious, perfect brine and so creamy! Fresh and yummy and highly recommended. We shared the Parmesan  and garlic fries which were very satisfying along with roasted brussel sprouts that were made with fresh orange and sweet soy. So delicious too! We ordered the lobster rolls that were served with old bay spice and fresh dill. They tasted fresh and not overly mayonnaised like some can be. I highly recommend and can't wait to go back for more!  The bartender could have been a little more friendly and attentive. Perhaps because we didn't order a drink, but I can only drink so much alcohol in a day.  I still love good food any time of the day, and this place definitely serves that!! I can't wait to back!!!",

I was told that the food is small plates meant to share but they just came out as they were ready and it felt weird. I got the skirt steak with their  chimichurri with a side of their sweet corn. . . The corn was freaking amazing! Sweet corn, with a salty cheese, some paprika and then a half lime to squeeze over the top. So flavorful and fresh! . . The steak was good but i expected more. I thought the chimichurri was too heavy on the spice. I like spicy food, but this was all you tasted and it was off putting. It was cooked perfectly though. The meat itself was so tender and moist.  . . What i would go back for, was their drinks. I got the Rum N Bramble and i could drink those all day and never think twice. Flor De Cana 7 year rum,  yuzu, dry vermouth, blackberry puree and basil. Drink was AMAZING!!  . . Overall, good experience but with so many options in Vegas, sugarcane is one i don't think I'll return to for dinner, but will go back for happy hour before!",

Asked the bartender if this was the norm for business and he stated that they had been slow all week up until tonight.  They have a cool HH from 4-7 where many of their appetizers are more than half off. Tried a lot quite a few of the apps including the Brussels sprouts, oysters, mini lobster roll, parmesan rosemary french fries. Everything we tried was solid and would order any of these items again.   The drinks were very reasonable as well, but we get those out on the floor while playing, so no need to fill up on those at the bar.   The HH is only available at the bar, so make sure to get there earlier rather than later, as the seats fill up very quickly.",

The food had good flavor, since this was tapas/small plates and meant for sharing, be prepared to order a few plates of each dish, although they say the plates are best for two people to share, depending on how hungry everyone is, you can probably get away with one plate for three people.  We had the grilled shrimp/toast, Korean short ribs, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, edamame, grilled corn, and salad. I think our favorite was the short ribs and Brussels sprouts.  Dishes comes out as they are ready and beware, servers will clear plates pretty quickly, too... I was still eating bites of food and they took a plate from under me.",

The Scallops, Ceviche and the Romaine salad were standout good.  The Crab Cakes turned out to be Crab Cake (Singular) That's $14 bucks for one.  That was the only disappointment.

We knew the GM, from his many years at SushiSamba, so wanted to try his new place.  Quite obvious he is extremely knowledgeable and enjoys what he does, as he took time to explain each dish's ingredients, preparation and commentary.  Started with seasoned Brussel sprouts, goat cheese croquettes, bacon-wrapped dates and liqueur samples.  All tasted amazing.  Then had raw halibut on ice, with sliced grapes, olives and seaweed, salmon poke.  Next had lobster slices with caviar and greens.  Waffles, roasted duck, duck egg with maple syrup came next, as the GM separated duck meat, breaking egg yolk and adding syrup.  We agreed this was the best dish.  Next sweet corn kernels with chipotle mayo, lemon salt, and skirt steak with watercress.  Dessert was french toast, caramelized apples with cinnamon ice cream.  A truly wonderful meal, not too heavy, but lots of different flavors to savor.  Aside from the delicious food, the GM and staff clearly added to our enjoyable dining experience.",

When the food came out, one of the orders came out with towel fibers on it(not edible or sanitary to eat so we sent it back) 3. The manager had came out after the mistake of our food not being made with bonbons(Nutella filled dough that we didn't ask for) and said sorry.  4. When the bill came we had been fully charged for our meal. We were surprised because we didn't feel like we should be charged fully for service that isn't up to their reputation. Working in the service industry myself, me and my boyfriend just expected a little bit more than we got.",

Few more minutes the place got pretty busy. I ordered the \"fat boy\" hash brown bacon sunny side up which was amazing! The portion looks small but it's delicious and pretty satisfying. Our server was amazing! We came at night for drinks and they have real good music! I was so surprised by how good this place was! Well deserved 5 stars!",

However, I feel like I can make a lot of their dishes at home, so I'm not sure if I want to come here again...   Tomato and burrata salad: I love this. Their burrata is so fresh and tastes so good.  Brussels sprouts: I don't normally like Brussels sprouts but I'm a big fan of this dish.  Avocado toast: very good but I feel like I can make this at home too... Seared sea scallops: you should try this. Their scallops are big, so for a plate of $22, you'll get 4 sea scallops...  Mini lobsters: I used to live in Boston so got a lot of mini lobsters before. It's good but on an expensive when I think back about my days eating lobsters endlessly without breaking my bank.   Grilled stuff: Sweet potatoes: again, nothing too special... I love sweet potatoes, so I bake them, grill them, boil them... at home, and it's so cheap at Asian markets.  Mushrooms: hmmm, I like mushrooms in general, so I can be biased, but the only thing is that I feel like I can make this at home... not sure if I would want to pay $14 for a very small amount of food. I could've made a big Tupperware of mushrooms that lasts for a week with $14.  Beef short ribs: it's on the sweet side. It's exactly the same as the short ribs you buy at the Korean market, Greenland. It's about $8.99 per pound or so. I haven't been there for a while so can't remember exactly the price.  Spanish octopus: it's tasty, the octopus is very meaty. Yum yum yum :)",

While the flavors were good, the more I drank it, I felt that the jalapeno really overpowered the rest of the drink. It got super spicy! I love spicy food but I want my drinks to go down a little smoother. Also, I didn't really feel it was very strong; I could really only taste juice. So I don't think it's worth $14. That being said, my friends seemed to be having better luck with their drinks so maybe it just depends what you order. Bartenders were friendly and the restaurant itself is really cool. It definitely feels like you're in Havana! Not sure I'd come back but if I did, I'd order something else.",

    "text": "I really like Vegas branching out to more interesting cuisines and away from the hoards of celebrity chefs.  I have no issues with restaurants popping up in Vegas from different cities (Miami), as it's nice change of pace from the typical steak, French or Italian.  Sugarcane has a raw bar and tapas and then a regular grill menu.  We decided to share a few tapas and had a drink a piece.  We tried the bacon wrapped dates, grilled shrimp, brussel sprouts, and tuna tartare.  The tartare and dates were recommended, but only the dates stood out from the waiter's recommendation.  The brussel sprouts were excellent and a must order.  The shrimp were pretty bland and basic.  My drink, the barrel aged rum Manhattan, was actually quite good, but a little expensive for a lunchtime cocktail at $16.  Suarcane is a nice rendition of lunch in Vegas for a different feel.  But it will run you about $25-30 per person before drinks..",

    "text": "Love the all day brunch idea.  Sugarcane offers a decent variety of brunch food.  We got there around 11 ish on a Sat morning.  It was not that busy at all.  We ordered the avocado toast and waffle.  Pretty simple stuff that can't be screwed up.   The avocado toast was so flavorful.  Loved the addition of the goat cheese and even the toast was pretty tasty.   The only problem was that avocado must have come from directly the fridge because it was cold, which made the egg cold along with everything else.   I loved the flavor, but wasn't too keen on quickly cooling food.  The waffle was your straight up waffle, nothing more nor nothing less.  Liked the mixed berries and the maple syrup was delicious.  Vanilla whipped cream was great, but personally would prefer vanilla whipped butter like Bouchon's.  Whipped cream makes it more like dessert.  Anyhoo, Sugarcane is an ok option for brunch, but I would recommend checking out brunch menu from other restaurants nearby like Chica and Yardbird as they seem to offer more exciting brunch options.",

There are bottles and bottles of rum filling the back wall of the bar and the music is comfortable.  My 4 stars are for the atmosphere, staff, and bartender Jason who was attentive, and gave well thought out reccomendations and service which may not always be hard to come by in Vegas, but it takes a special person to look you in the eyes and give you palpable hospitality. He served an espresso with a lemon twist and recommended the smoked fish dip. The dip was a bit bland and not all that. Im not sure what it was missing but it didn't have that umph that a delectable dish drives home.",

I started with a rum and bramble from the menu, which was well balanced, but once he realized I knew something about cocktails, he made me an amazing Mai tai (and I don't like tiki drinks...). He smoked thyme and rosemary with like zest, and the drink was super complex and well balanced - way better than any Mai tai I've ever had!  It's pretty rare to have someone put so much work into a cocktail at a busy bar.   Food: Initially, i wasn't planning to eat this much by myself...  - Scallop crudo: super sweet and fresh from Hokkaido, wrapped around a compressed apple, with jalapeno and truffles. There are so many textures and flavors, but it's not an overly strong dish. It was interesting but clean  - Pig ear pad thai: fried pig ears with house made pad thai sauce and a papaya salad. Surprisingly not heavy. Interesting textures and flavors  - Goat cheese croquettes: one of their signature dishes. Smooth and very cheesy, not just potato filler, served on a quince paste marmalade  I got super lucky at the bar. I was trying to pick between all the places around here, and I'm glad I ended up here.",

The pig ears were deep fried, the salad was way too much fish source, it's so salty that we couldn't move on to the bottom.  -lamb tartar: the chip was really good, it's very light weight and very thin and crispy. My hubby ate all the raw lamb tartar.  -Brussels sprouts: its deeply fried and the whole dish was salty for us too.  -Arnold palmer: my hubby said it's really good, he had four of them.  -dessert: it's the pumpkin spice macaroon, it's ok. It seems the macaroon was made couple days before.  -price: it's a very expensive brunch for two people with three four small dishes and a Arnold palmer. It's almost $150.

I'm a big fan of Sushisamba just a short walk away, and Sugarcane (opened by the same restaurant group) is a solid addition to the rotation of restaurants in the Venetian/Palazzo sister hotels.  We were able to get a table right away on a Sunday afternoon. I liked the laid back vibe of the decor - a bit different than any of the other places in the hotels' restaurant row, which are more classic like Delmonico and B&B. The menu is globally-inspired small plates that are meant to be shared. There were many things that I wanted to try! But my party and I ended up choosing these items:   Burrata salad: Delicious! Unique addition of an olive tapenade as dressing. Pig ear pad thai papaya salad: Ultra crispy pig ear was really well done. Sweet and salty and sour all in one. Would definitely order this next time! Bacon wrapped dates: I'm a sucker for these, and the linguica sausage was a nice little twist on this classic appetizer. Chimichurri steak: Well-cooked, but not super special. Yellowtail collar: A bit on the salty side!  Cauliflower soup (special): Very creamy and flavorful.  Overall, I enjoyed my first meal here! I'll be returning to sample the rest of the menu, since I often stay at Venetian/Palazzo. :)",

I sampled a variety of small plates, including the Hokkaido scallop crudo, tuna tartare, duck and waffle, and uni/avocado toast. All of the dishes were very tasty and proportioned well - the seafood was fresh, and the duck/waffle was decadently rich.   However, service was a definite lowlight. I didn't receive the cocktail that I ordered until halfway through the meal, and dishes came out erratically with absolutely no attempt at proper pacing, with our table fluctuating between barren and overly crowded with plates. An order of shrimp cocktail and grilled octopus were evidently both forgotten - the shrimp cocktail arrived only at the end of the meal, and I ended up canceling the octopus order as both items were clearly inputted only after we inquired about the long wait after we had finished the rest of our dishes. The service recovery attempt was fair (all drinks comped), but the consensus of our party was that service was ultimately subpar and inexcusable despite the CES crowds.",

It was three of us and we had (in order of delicious-ness / wow factor) 1) pig ear pad thai 2) beef short ribs 3) goat cheese croquettes 4) japanese fried chicken 5 & 6) chicken & pork meatballs & heirloom tomato & burrata salad  The pig ear pad thai was out of this world. It's literally thin crispy pieces of pig ears made to look like pad thai and it is absolutely fantastic. The beef short ribs were soft and flavorful, and fell right off the bone. The goat cheese croquettes were small (only 5 small pieces) but absolutely delicious. The japanese fried chicken, chicken & pork meatballs and the heirloom tomato & burrata salad were also really good but nothing too special.   I had the \"Spice of Love\" as my drink and it was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. Like a blend of mango jalapeno deliciousness.   The service was good and the food was even better - my biggest regret is not taking pictures of my food.",

My other faves in no particular order were the bacon wrapped dates (I love anything w/ portuguese sausage inside), elote style corn off the cob, brussels, and the flank steak.   Dessert gets it's own paragraph because I loved it that much. The name escapes me, but it was a cinnamon french toast bread pudding thingy with apples on it with the most delicious homemade ice cream on the side. Get that!  My one mini-gripe is the pace of service. Probably because everything was so good, I couldn't wait for the next course!  Seems like Sugarcane is often pretty empty, but their food definitely deserves a much bigger audience.",

We were looking for a casual, vibrant, foodie place and this met all the requirements. We visited during their happy hour and take advantage of the discounted drinks and appetizers. Before I get into the food, I want to say that the staff in the bartenders were so welcoming and accommodating which is what I think made this place much more enjoyable.   So now the food. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the shrimp cocktail, and seasoned fries from the appetizer menu. All the servings were small, however, they packed a mouth full of flavor. The fries were delicious, the dates were to die for, and the shrimp was extremely fresh. I would recommend all three items if you visit.   Another highlight were the drinks. We ordered from the happy hour menu and I was blown away by their version of an old fashion. I can't even describe it, it was just delicious. They also had my favorite rum, Diplomatically, which is what earn them that fifth and final start.",

We weren't too hungry so yelped around for something simple and that might have some tapas style. I came across Sugarcane, and had been craving rack of lamb so decided on their menu.   The inside is spacious, and looked even bigger since there was barely any people. The menu has a great range from appetizers, seafood, small plates, sides and entrees. I was ready to order the lamb but they had SOLD OUT! I was so sad as that was the main reason we came here, so had to improvise haha.   _Hokkaido Scallop ($16) Compressed apple, black truffle, lime, jalapeno. I get tapas style, and I get everything in Vegas is mostly pricey for very small portions, but come on for $16 this was a joke. There was 6 tiny pieces of scallop, that was half the size of my pinky. I got this because I love truffle, but I could barely taste any. The flavors you get are a whole lot of tart and citrus. The apple itself was soft. I thought it would be crispy to give it a nice bite, but it fell a bit flat.  _Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Salad ($14) Olive caper vinaigrette. This was one of my favorite dish! Never knock a salad out because you never know how damn good it can be. he tomatoes were all fresh and juicy. They were all small and cut in halves so you can just plop them in your mouth. The burrata was good, although it could have been more milkier. The best part however was that olive caper vinaigrette. Something I've never had, It was sweet, tart, and salty from the capers. It really brought this whole dish together. So much flavor. _Sweet Corn ($10) Chipotle mayo, lemon salt. This is pretty much what I expected. Sweet corn/elote that you would get from the trucks or side carts. It was good, nothing amazing. The flavors were all there. It was sweet and tangy. So much better when you squeeze some lime on top. A great side dish to have with your meat or fish.  _Spanish Octopus ($15) Aji panca. This was a disappointment. The presentation lacked. It was just on 1 skewer with a small simple salad on the side. The texture was a bit rubbery and hard to chew. The flavor was some type of bbq not quite sure, but it was mediocre. The salad was refreshing and need to eat with the octopus as it was bland.  _Whole Roasted Chicken ($42) Truffle marble potato, wild mushrooms. I'm so glad we opted for this! For some reason I thought it was a half chicken and forgot we got a whole. When It came out my jaw dropped. It looked like a Thanksgiving feast. This dish can at least feed 3-4. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was so juicy and so thrilled it was not over salty, the skin was also nicely crisp. The different colors of the finger potatoes made it eye appealing and who doesn't like small potatoes. Now this is what I call TRUFFLE! There was so much truffle in there every bite I took was truffle truffle truffle. You can see it all on the bottom as well. I just took that big serving spoon and scooped up as much as I can. The mushrooms were also great and just so earthy. This dish is a must! definitely worth the price.  We were so full after that chicken we had no room for dessert but damn wish we did. The lady was shocked that we finished the chicken lol. We tried to stay away from the potatoes, as that would fill us up.",

The hostess was clueless and should have added servers to our area or put us on a different area. Definitely not enough servers. Went across to Yardbird and had water drink orders in within 5 minutes of getting there.",

For dessert we split the torrejas... dulce de leche soaked french toast! All I want to know is where has this dessert been all my life!? Mind. Blown.  I highly recommend stopping in and checking this place out if you like great service and amazing food. ;)",

If you offer a $150 Caviar, the level of service should be commensurate with that. The utensils where nothing short of cheap plastics. This really took away from my experience.   Coffee took forever. There needs to be some attentiveness to the clients.  The tap water also had a strange smell.   There is certainly room for improvement.  I did share my concerns with the manager and we received a 20% discount. My intentions were truly to direct their attention to points of improvement, but I do appreciate their gesture.",

Service:  The service has never been short of fantastic.  The lead servers have all been so friendly and helpful with menu selections.  Drinks at the table have always been fresh.  Managers have stopped by to check on the table on numerous occasions and I really appreciate that.  I've never had a bad dish at Sugarcane  They have always been good or great with great meaning I'm ordering it on the next visit. More plates to add to my mixtape/fav dishes list at Sugarcane:  goat cheese croquettes:  small in size, but HUGE in flavor.  Ordering these every time bacon wrapped dates: I'm not really into dates so this dish really surprised me on how much I enjoyed it.  Sugarcane is one of the few places where I'll try a dish made with a food I normally don't eat.  I can't express enough how consistently great the overall service has been with the staff.The hits keep on coming at Sugarcane and I always seem to walk out of there in a better mood and full af.  This is a great place to visit for lunch, business dinners, date night and everything in between if you have an open mind for trying unique dishes from the 3 kitchen concept.  Enjoy!",

The sweetness of the date itself, the smokiness of the bacon, and the richness of the linguica and manchego worked well together, with no one flavor dominating the palate. I do wish the manchego had a more forward presence, but that just me. Also, $16 seems slightly expensive, but then again this is a fairly interesting tapa.  The duck - one haunch - had a slightly crisped skin and remained its internal juices, which is important given duck's tendency to be dry. The waffle itself seemed satisfactory and a touch sweet. Luckily, the accompanying syrup was not too sweet and had a hint of cinnamon.  The fries seemed satisfactory - simple, fresh, and neither overly salted nor overly fried.",

We shared the following four dishes.  Wedge salad - the iceberg wedge was cut from the tender heart of the lettuce head. It was topped with cherry tomatoes and a wonderfully, creamy ranch dressing.  Korean style short ribs - the ribs were a bit fatty, but still our unanimous favorite. The marinade and reduction was sweet and flavorful. It was accented by delicate slices of jalapeno peppers.   Seasonal mushrooms  - the enokitake mushrooms were fresh and tender. They were prepared in a sweet Asian sauce. The thin stems were still attached to their natural growth.  Shrimp - seasoned and grilled.  The shrimp were garnished with fresh cilantro, and served with small pieces of bread. Good, but the least favorite of our choices.  My only complaint was the restaurant noise level. We were seated adjacent to the bar area (main dining seating would have been longer wait), and it was LOUD. It felt like everyone was screaming. Service was a tad slow.",

The server arrived promptly and took our drink order, as well as explained the menu to us. It's like tapas with a Spanish flair. So you order several items each and share.  The hubs ordered blue fin tuna tartare(pictured), said it was delicious and fresh. Enjoyed the presentation. Also ordered half dozen oysters(assorted) and this was also good.   I ordered the chimichurri skirt steak was cooked to a perfect medium as desired. It was seriously the best I've ever had. I like that it came sliced for easy sharing and with a yummy lite watercress salad.  The sweet corn (comes off the cob) was tasty and a definite reorder. And let me not forget the sweet potatoes, omg. Hopefully you don't have a nut allergy because these come donned in a maple soy glaze with candied walnuts. It is a favorite for sure.   I highly recommend checking this place out for its delicious menu, great atmosphere and superb service. Unfortunately, I can't remember my severs name but she was fantastic. Everyone who came by to drop off food ( food comes out as ready) was beyond pleasant and always asked if we needed anything.",

They're located in Restaurant Row, between the Venetian and Palazzo. We ordered the truffled toad in the hole ($18), sweet corn ($13) and beignets ($18). Everything was on the pricier side. No one like the truffled toad in the hole. It was so sweet, too much honey. I think we thought it would be more savory than sweet. The sweet corn was just okay, nothing special. My friends did not like the beignets, apparently they are not similar to New Orleans style beignets. I've never had them before, so I didn't know what they were supposed to taste like. Also a coffee had to be sent back because it was watered down. Overall two stars because the server was nice, albeit a bit inattentive. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things?",

The two of us shared 5 dishes for dinner and left full and satisfied sort of like George's girl friend after eating her risotto.    We had a salad followed by an outstanding lineup of chicken & pork meatballs, octopus, Thai ribs, and a sliced steak. All of these dishes had lots of flavors carefully crafted and mixed to create outstanding taste sensations.    Still thinking about the octopus and the meat balls.  And the ribs.  And the steak.",

    "text": "Nothing says \"eclectic tapas\" like Sugarcane! Talk about options; the three kitchens (open fire grill, raw bar and traditional kitchen) means this restaurant has ALL the bases covered for a huge variety of tastes and palates. There's something for everyone on the menu. It's a great place for a light bite and some people-watching!  My favs:  -- Wagyu beef carpaccio: between the gochujang, black garlic aioli, microgreens and crispy rice, there was a fantastic interplay of textures and flavors. This is not your average beef carpaccio! -- Pig ear pad thai papaya salad: don't sleep on this one! The fattiness of the crisp fried pig ear was broken up by the zingy freshness of the papaya salad. This was a flavorful, well-balanced salad with lots of umami elements. (Despite the name, there is no pad thai in this dish.) -- Brussels sprouts: deliciously crispy, nutty charred leaves, a couple orange slices, and sweet soy glaze on the side. A good healthy choice amidst all the other sinful menu offerings :)  Can't wait to go back for more!",

    "text": "My husband and I scored tickets to see the show next door to Sugarcane. Since we had to pickup our tickets between 5:30 and 6:30, we planned to get to the Venetian to pickup our tickets at 5:30 and giving us time to have a little dinner or appetizers before the show started at 7:00 pm.  Once we got our tickets at the box office in the middle of Restaurant Row, my husband suggested appetizers at one of the bar areas so we could also enjoy a little bit of college football. In this specific area, there are four restaurants to choose from; seafood, Americana bar, fried chicken and Sugarcane. Sugarcane's appetizer menu just seemed more appealing than the others and what got me was Happy Hour on a Saturday! I just felt the need to take advantage of it.  Because I didn't do any research and with all the talks of the hurricane relief occurring in Puerto Rico, I just thought this was more a Latin style restaurant. My husband and I really didn't bother to take a look at the full menu, so there might be Latin items on the menu. However, based on the happy hour menu, I'm not getting Latin. Tapas/small plates, I do get that. Is it fair to yelp without knowing anything about the restaurant to go off of perception of the establishment name and logo/branding? I say yes, because it may help to prove branding of the establishment.  In any case, we walked in on the bar side of the restaurant and saw the sign that we needed to go all the way to the other side of the restaurant to check in with the host. So we do so with me nailing the inside of my below on this wooden bar thing that I think is supposed to separate the main restaurant area from the bar area. Yup, I got me a nice bruise and it still hurts this next afternoon.  We get to the host station and let them know we are here simply for HH only for the host to tell us that HH is only at the bar. If there is no available seats, to come back to the host and they would seat us at a table. So carefully, I walk back to the bar to avoid nailing my other elbow on that bar separator thingy to find two open seats at the bar all the way at the corner end, under the TV that is playing the Auburn/Minnesota game.  Within a few minutes, the bartender made her way to us and provided the menus. The whole restaurant is dimly lit, so thank goodness there was a lamp at the corner we were sitting at. The menu font size is tiny too. So we grab at the HH menus and push aside the dinner and the wine lists. For a restaurant in a casino hotel like the Venetian, I'm glad to say that the HH menu prices are reasonably priced between $4 and $8. Just be careful though, some items like the sliders have \"ea.\" next to it. Meaning that each slider you want to get is $5/each, not $5 for 2 or 3.   We drink very responsibly and since it is still early in the evening, I ordered a Frose (frozen blended drink with kettle one, peach schnapps, prickly apple puree, rose) while my husband settled for a Stella Artois instead of the Tobacco Rum Old Fashion since he had no cigar to enjoy it with, so we'll be back for sure. The Frose is a cute pink drink, so I think it's funny when I saw it delivered to a few men at the bar. The drink was a little on the tart side instead of sweet that I would expect from a rose and peach schnapps. But once I had it with the food items, the flavor changed a little bit. Because this is a frozen blended drink, you can't just tank it or else suffer the brain and chest freeze.  Food Items  The garlic fries came in a small bowl, but even in a small bowl, it's a lot of fries. I would say at least the fries that were at the top were garlicky, but as we got to the bottom, not so much, which is probably okay since we still had a show to go to and we were sitting in between other people.  The oysters, teeny tiny but still good and raw, thus meeting the \"raw\" part of the restaurant theme.  When the goat cheese croquettes were dropped off, the server did mention that it was with a marmalade sauce. Because it was a little dark in our corner, I didn't realize the sauce was underneath the cheese balls until I ate the last one. You would think it would have at least a little of it on the other ones I ate, but there wasn't any. For me, the marmalade was just ok with the cheese.  I think the highlight was the dates since we've never had one before. My husband is a big foodie and watches Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bourdain and it was in an episode that Anthony Bourdain did in the lost desert towns of CA that I learned where dates come from. I recommend trying this dish. If you like sweet potato, you like bacon, you like sweet and salty, you will enjoy this dish.  I don't have the sophisticated palette of most of you that might be reading this review. However, I have had my fair share of Latin food, tapas and happy hours. In comparison, the food is ok.  Customer service is great here and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing.  We will certainly be back to try the full menu and the Tobacco Rum.",

    "text": "Every once in a while I find a restaurant that where I have such a bad experience that I have to share. This was SUGARCANE. I'm giving them a bonus star because I did not sample their namesake: the raw bar. Otherwise the place was crap. Expensive crap.  We went here because the two adjacent restaurants to our convention had a longer wait, but by the end of our meal I was literally looking longingly at them through the window. Everything was tiny portioned, everything was overpriced. The staff seemed lost (we saw a discussion with the bartender when they brought out eight dishes and the bartender said \"I only ordered one\") and we rarely saw our waitress. She forgot or didn't report any of the slight modifications to our meals, and when she stopped by to check on us she was gone in milliseconds, and all of our mouths were full from our first bite, so we couldn't remind her and she didn't come back for like 20 minutes.  After the poke looked unimpressive, we went with basic sandwiches feeling reluctant at the menu. I was HUNGRY, and most of it sounded pretty mediocre. It was. Also they don't have anything: the only cheese they have is American, they don't have ranch dressing, they apparently don't have lettuce or tomatoes for the hamburgers.  Also the pricing is terrible. They use tapas as entrees but charge full entree price. It's ridiculous. I'm a local, I know how much stuff costs on the strip, they have no right to charge this much for what we received. For dinner we went to Public House, I happily spent a lot more and felt like I was getting what I paid for and then some.  GO ACROSS THE WAY TO YARDBIRD OR PUBLIC HOUSE. THEY'RE GREAT.",

We ordered a bunch of different things all of which were super delicious. Salmon poke was yummy and had these little rice crisp balls to give it some texture. The octopus might have been the best I have had, there was a spicy sauce over it and a nice char on the octopus itself. Brussel sprouts were to die for, the orange and soy glaze was delicious. We did the fluke kombu crudo and the bluefin tuna crudo, fish was extremely fresh on both. I love that they have oysters on their happy hour too! For drinks we did a frose , a mojito, and a middle strawberry and vodka drink, G also made me a cocktail he came up with which was amazing. For dessert we had the torrejas, which was the perfect ending and I would go back to Sugarcane just for this. Overall I love love loved!!! The staff was knowledgeable and told me everything that was on each place. G was extremely accommodating and made great conversation. I think with a high volume location, and being in Vegas.. a lot of places on the strip lack good old hospitality and solid bar service. Not Sugarcane! If you get a chance, stop by and ask for G!!!",

There was a very odd/weird energy going on with the bar staff, bickering amongst one another, very disorganized.  Our female bartender consistently hurried us, continually took our food and condiments away while we were still eating, as well as the last 1/3 of my Mojito.  We couldn't understand \"what the hurry\" was, with only 4 of us eating at the entire bar.  Among other items, we ordered the lobster rolls, and they twice brought us \"Spanish Octopus\", so we had to wait for all for that correction to happen, with no apologies.  Our bartender would only talk to my wife, and ignored me.....?  We mentioned all this to the Manager while exiting, he did NOTHING.  Easily the WORST service and energy we've had at any Las Vegas restaurant/bar in over 40 years.  Really, really sad.",

We told her the eggs were cold and at this point not edible she literally said, \"well it's a tapas bar what do you expect!?\" So of course we asked for the manager and she said, \"I'll go get him, we were going to kick you out anyway because your friend ALMOST threw up.\" (My friend is pregnant and was experiencing morning sickness btw but was able to contain it) The manager was kind enough to comp the bill for everyone due to her poor service - this girl clearly hates her job and life.

This was definitely as huge factor in our food coming very quickly. We ordered A LOT of food, so I can only remember some of things we got. The duck and waffle was absolutely delicious. The ribs were amazing. I don't remember anything else, but there was not a bad dish in the bunch. The waiter was super helpful when we were ordering. He let us know if the dish we wanted to get would be enough for the 7 of us, and would suggest alternatives if it wasn't. I'm kinda sad I can't remember his name, but he was awesome! We ordered some drinks as well. I got the Rum & Bramble. It was on the sweeter side, which I usually don't like, but I still enjoyed it.   After we were done with our food, the waiter brought the birthday girl a dessert and we all sang happy birthday to her. It was some sort of apple French toast thing that was served in a small cast iron skillet and a side of ice cream. It was delicious and, more impressively, free!  I would highly, highly recommend this place. The bill was pretty sizeable, but with food this delicious and the service we received, I say it's definitely worth it.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas in December and had the treat of visiting Sugarcane. LOVED IT! Do not have enough good things about our entire experience. We're from California and it can be difficult to find the cuisine we enjoy and feel like you're getting your moneys worth in Vegas.   Service is on point. Our server, Raquel (I believe!) was absolutely fantastic. Knowledgeable and kind - she described every dish as it came to the table. Manager Will (I think!) was engaging, welcoming and gave us great recommendations for other restaurants & bars to visit that were more our style.   Food was phenomenal. Everything as described and each item's flavor was exceptional. Creative pairings and unique ingredients. Cocktails were a win all around - creative and tasty. Wish we'd taken pictures, but everything was too delicious and there was no waiting by our party for those antics. Please please enjoy this gem of a spot!",

Appreciated the great cocktail menu. Classic cocktails available for Strip prices, but the value for price lived up to expectations.   Try the bone marrow and the pig ear pad thai. Every item is flavorful.   Looking forward to our next visit.",

The brunch items were so unusual (for us) and tasty and Danny did such a fine job on drinks that we stopped by the next three days. Ask Danny to make his variation on the White Lady. Very tasty. We tried several items on the happy hour menu as well and each was prepared wonderfully.",

    "text": "Sugarcanes appears to be a newer restaurant in the Venetian. It's billed as a tapas style restaurant which means you're ordering lots of small dishes to feed the table. I'm ok with the concept, it can be quite enjoyable. We found a similar restaurant, Sego, in Kanab, UT where everything was just incredible.  Not so here :-(  Ambience is good, typical Vegas with a Cuban influence. If you like run, this is the place, I lost count of the different names.  We had just arrived in the hotel so we were eating early  5ish. Restaurant was pretty empty but they seat us right next to the serving station. The server takes our drink order but forgets (several times) my son's drink.  First round of \"tapas\" arrives: Thai style pork ribs (excellent) Duck and waffle (duck confit, waffle, Sunnyside up duck egg. Incredible dish, the table favorite :-D ) Salmon poke (eh) Hokkaido scallop (several paper thin slices of scallop on jicama. Not bad but overpriced) Angus sliders (RIPOFF. $8 / slider, a piece of meat just slightly bigger than a Kennedy half dollar) 2nd round: Beef ribs(ok) Crispy Smashed potatoes with salsa verde (excellent) Avocado toast (very good) Lobster roll (ok) Special of the night: beef empenada (another table favorite, EXCELLENT)  As you can tell, we really enjoyed the food. What brings this rating down is the terrible service (the bus boy who kept circling our table like a predator stalking it's prey was especially creepy) and the price gouging (even for Vegas). Our bill was $300 (without tip).  If you have money to burn and don't mind bad service, go for it",
