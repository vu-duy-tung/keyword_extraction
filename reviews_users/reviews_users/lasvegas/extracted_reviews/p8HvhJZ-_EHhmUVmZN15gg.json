    "text": "Quick review: Have eaten there twice, first experience was stellar, second experience was flawed and they forgot to add chicken on my chicken salad (to go order).   In depth review: great concept. Fast and somewhat healthy options and very reasonably priced. This is the first restaurant to go into that location that is actually busy so they must be doing something right. Some fine and tasty salads, soups and sandwich options. They give you a chocolate covered strawberry and thats' a neat lil touch.   Complaints -  1) Forgot my chicken on my chicken salad when it was crunch time on a busy Friday night. Doh!  2) Lack of healthy soup options. All the soup options that I have sampled are damn tasty but they are loaded with sodium and in a heavy cream sauce. Would like to see some chicken broth  stock options w/ less sodium.  3) Parking is difficult know that the property owners have jammed 4 busy restaurants in that corner.   Overall - I think this place will do just fine. Great concept with fresh, fast, reasonably priced and somewhat healthy food. Reminds me of that other Utah based chain across the street, Cafe Rio. Utah chains are solid.",

    "text": "So the Asian Persuasion  Family of yelp decided to have a family dinner here. I thought to myself, this is awesome, I have heard so much about this place and finally I get to try it out!  This place is located near Silverado Ranch and Eastern, more towards on Richmar and Eastern to be exact, right next to Republic Kitchen. Easy to find you can't miss it.  The place is very clean, your greeted by a friendly staff at the door. The menu is very plain and simple, easy to read, and most important, they have pretty reasonable prices, I highly recommend the Combo which gives you a full size sandwich with a choice of 1/2 soup or 1/2 salad all for $7.99, where can you go wrong there right?  I ordered the Thai Mango Chicken salad with the California Turkey Sandwich. The Thai Mango salad was very delicious and loved everything in the salad. The Thai Mango Chicken Salad had, chicken , lettuce, fried wonton noodles of some sort, mango and some type of vinigerette Thai sauce, that I can't explain.  As for my California Turkey sandwich , that included, the turkey with light mayo and cheese, avocado, cucumbers served on cibatta  bread ( sorry for the typo too lazy to look it up hehe).  The combo also included French bread and chocolate covered strawberries to complete the meal.  Overall I reall enjoyed my dining experience at Cafe Zupas, I would love to go back and try all their other sandwiches and try a soup. And most important the food is great and its freaking cheap!",

When I voiced my concern I was told that they are only able to put \"2 scoops\"  of soup into the bowl. I also got cheese and bacon which was an additional .69 each. Which I feel is a bit pricey for the small amounts that were added. I have been here several times before and left feeling satisfied, but I never just ordered soup. After seeing the large bowel I assumed I would have enough soup for two meals, but to my surprise there's barely enough for one. I don't like being tricked so I will never return to zupas for a $8.40 half bowl of soup. Do better Zupas and don't mislead your customers.",

The Vermont Blueberry salad was so good, that I did a ninja check in today and repeated that same order....and bought a bunch of strawberries on top of my free strawberry.

    "text": "Reminds me of when a guy \"messes up\" and sends flowers to your work to make everything okay. Cafe Zupas tries this trick with the delicious chocolate covered strawberry with every meal.   Not bad. Not the greatest. I cannot give it anymore than three stars from my first meal with them.   Ultimate Grilled Cheese- Cheddar, Muenster, Tomatoes & House-made Pesto Sauce. This was good. The bread reminds me of the two ends nobody wants to eat in the loaf. Once I got past that thought I actually enjoyed the sandwich. Good job Zupas.  Tomato Basil with Orzo Pasta- This shit was sweeter than the chocolate covered strawberry! I hated it and only took two bites (because I will try anything twice). I also sampled the Chicken Tortilla- too salty, the Wild Mushroom- too salty. Maybe I am just one picky Mofo when it comes to soups, but they just don't work for me.  Chocolate Covered Strawberry- She was a beauty. She made everything better. So much better I almost forgot how much I disliked the soups!  I can see myself coming back here to try the Thai Peanut Chicken Sandwich and one of their twelve different salads. I will have to get past the fact:  They have sooooo many minions, I mean employees. It's fucking overkill and the exact opposite experience I want to have on my lunch break.   The way the interior is designed flares up my Claustrophobia. Again, not what I find appealing.   Other than those minor issues I will be back to hopefully bump them up a star. For now, I am leaving this place alone until the rest of the town tries it and just finds it's nothing special.",

    "text": "This was a solid, but not spectacular lunch.  We arrived shortly after opening at 11 on a weekday.  There were a couple of people already ahead of us in line.  It's a bit overwhelming, lots of soup, salads, and sandwiches to choose from.  You can sample the soups, which was cool.  My favorites were the gumbo and clam chowder, I'll order one of those next time we eat here.  For lunch, I had the bacon turkey and honey mustard sandwich with the BBQ chicken salad.  The sandwich was pretty average, I could have easily made it at home.  White bread with a bit of turkey and decent honey mustard smashed with a Panini press.  I was not impressed and won't order this again, don't know why I talked myself out of the pulled pork.  The salad was a good portion for the price, the chicken had no flavor, but the BBQ sauce was good.  I could have used more, also more onions.  No heat on this salad, I'll try to see if they have jalapenos or something next time.  Salads come with bread, which was no good, and a chocolate covered strawberry, which was fantastic.  It was a very good quality strawberry, juicy and deep red  color.    The wife had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup with the red pepper Caesar salad.  I liked the salad, but it needed a little more dressing.  It was dry, but too much dressing would have drowned it.  The soup was very surprising, I am not a cauliflower person so I was not expecting to like it.  But, it's basically a cheese soup.  Yet another example that soups and stews are great places to hide veggies.  It was thick and hearty, a definite repeat.  Service was great, everyone was friendly, and even with all the options, the line moves along very quickly.  I think this location has found a place that will be here for several years.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas is a fast-casual restaurant that is new to Nevada, its first location is now open in Henderson near the shopping center at Richmar and Eastern. A second is coming soon to Summerlin. Cafe Zupas has had great success in Utah and Arizona. They offer homemade soups, freshly made salads, paninis, and gourmet sandwiches. I was fortunate to receive an invite to a VIP party that allowed Frank and I to sample various menu items. All guests were warmly welcomed and encouraged to sample the Try 2 Combo, which comes with a whole sandwich, half soup and half salad for $7.99. The Kid's Meal Combo is $3.99.  Salads are made in front of you as you order, soups are made fresh daily in Cafe Zupas' kitchen, and sandwiches are fixed when you place your order. It is quite the assembly line. I chose the Tomato Basil soup with Orzo Pasta, topped with asiago cheese for .59, their signature salad Nuts About Berries and Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini. Frank had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich. They got started on our orders right away, all components were added to our tray, we selected Brownies for dessert and our order came with Belgian Chocolate Covered Strawberries. By the time you pay your tab (ours was gratis on this visit), your order is complete and ready to be whisked away to a cozy table in the dining room.    We dug into the soups first, the Tortilla soup is fantastic and loaded with flavor. It was so tasty Frank devoured it before I could snap a photo. The Tomato Basil was good, but less of favorite. It's quite sweet and very heavy on basil flavor. I hear the Wild Mushroom Bisque is not to be missed so I'll try that one next time.  Next, we tried the salads, I had the better of two with Nuts About Berries. It was loaded with fresh berries and topped with cinnamon almonds and lightly dressed with poppyseed dressing. It' a bit sweet, but not cloying so it was enjoyable. The BBQ Chicken salad was loaded with tomatoes, black beans, corn, olives, red onion and dressed with buttermilk ranch. What it lacked was BBQ chicken. There are ten other salads to choose from one is sure to strike your fancy.  Unfortunately, the sandwiches were the weakest link. This is a shame because their Italian Ciabatta bread is really fresh and delicious. The BBQ Pulled Pork tasted more like honey mustard that BBQ. It wasn't a very hearty sandwich. Sadly, the turkey wasn't very good. It tasted like prepackaged deli meat. I prefer freshly sliced deli meats. I expected actual artichokes on the sandwich, but it was a spread. That was my mistake, the menu clearly states a three cheese artichoke spread. I overlooked it. Truly, the bread is so good, I'd try the gourmet sandwiches again. I'm interested in the Asian BBQ Pork and the Vegetarian.  Dessert ended the meal on a pleasant note. I love Belgian Chocolate Dipped Strawberries so those alone wooed me, but the brownies were quite good and oh, so decadent. Gooey caramel and candy topped one and the other was more of a bar with coconut, nuts, chocolate and other goodness.   The staff was incredibly friendly, they gave out dozens of prizes including water bottles and giftcards. Discounts and prizes will also be given out during their Grand Opening celebration on May 18. There are few places where a complete meal can be had for less than ten bucks, but it can be done at Cafe Zupas.",

My roommate and I go there at least 2-3 times a week- they are fast and super friendly (maybe even too happy lol ) the price is really reasonable and in the combo you even get a whole sandwhich instead of the half you get at most places. The only complaint I have is that a couple of times we've gone there was no asiago croutons for my soup which was very disappointing since they are delicious!",

    "text": "Yesterday, my boyfriend and I tried Cafe Zupas for lunch. It was our first time. I was a little hesitant at first, but my hunger was making me bitchy and I didn't want the usual greasy burger, fries and fountains of ranch. We were immediately greeted by quite a few employees. They were all polite and genuine. I had no idea how the place worked, how to order food, or, apparently, where to stand in line. Regardless, the employees pointed us in the right direction and helped us order our meals. One guy persuaded me into getting the strawberry salad, which sounded so weird to me, but I gave in and tried it and it was so f****** amazing that I died. The pesto turkey sandwich thing brought me back though. The chocolate dipped strawberries on the side were so f****** cute I just could not the entire time. I was literally can'ting. They have a charging station for all of you who can't live without your phones and everything was clean. The kitchen was clean and the tables were wiped down immediately after guests left them. The employee who rang up my order (I didn't get his name because I'm rude and I also lost my receipt) was awesome to talk to. He was so sweet. He was a blonde guy with a nice smile. I wanted throw dollar bills at him, but he said they didn't accept tips. I SAID WUT. WUT DO U MEAN NO TIP??! Hey management, how hard is it to put a tip jar out for your hard-working, dedicated employees?! Next time I'm in there, I better see a tip jar or I'm bringing my own the next time I'm in there after that.   That strawberry salad was so f****** good.  Keep up the good work you guys! We may not express it all of the time, but people like all of you in the customer service industry are greatly appreciated by consumers like me.  Thank you!",

Even Burger King and Mcdonalds have nutritional guides! And by comparison, you should probably eat there. You'll be downing the same amount of calories from BK/McD's that you'll take in at Zupas; you might as well leave satisfied. (Not that I recommend eating BK or McD's on a regular basis.) I think this place tries to appear healthy, and they're definitely trying to present a product that is superior to fast food chains. A little more bourgeois for the types that refuse to eat at traditional fast food joints. However, the devil is in the details. I would say this place is dangerous for anyone trying to lose weight. And It appears that those who are looking for \"healthier\" fast food options, are Zupas secret demographic. (And young people, of course. Quite obviously! There's a smart phone charging station, Duh!) You'll leave this place filling light, completely unaware that you just consumed about the same amount of calories found in a Double Whopper. And then an hour later, you'll be eating again. No worries, Zupas asks \"please don't hold your table\" not that they really give you a choice. Large reverse vacuum pipes blow subzero air directly above most tables. Therefore, they'll definitely be a free table waiting for you to come back and consume more!   If you're not a calorie counter, the food is decent enough, I guess. If you're hungry when you leave, however, I wouldn't say it's a very good value.",

The tortilla soup was ok. I had very few veggies or chicken, it was 90% tortilla strips. The sandwich was dry but decent, but we didn't care for the jambalaya. I thought the complimentary chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. If you're on-the-go this is a good option.",

They are practically pushy to keep that line moving and under pressure you'll quite possibly forget something or order something nasty to try out...  I think the way to is the soup and salad combo. For 7.99 you are full or you can share if you had breakfast or want dinner later... depending on your plans.  We got lobster bisque and tomato risotto, a few turkey sandwiches etc. Both were good, not excellent. I noticed most of the soups are creamy, milky and heavy. There needs to be a tortellini broth or something healthier as a choice too. The sandwiches have cheap deli meat. Everyone liked their food but no one loved it enough to rave about it. A step above Jimmy Johns but I'd still rather go to Panera.  The cons are the atmosphere is awful , and the parking is tough in that corner. It is very loud like a school lunchroom.  :( And they have these signs all over the place stating \"please don't hold your table\" ... as if! Give me a break if you are paying 25.00 for lunch I say sit your tushie down and relax. You are already getting your own food and drinks...  So for me this is an _ If I am in the area and want soup and it's a slow hour I might go in and get some soup to go kind of place. But that's about it. No one wanted to go back in that line or that noise again. Not worth travelling for unless its really your bag.",

    "text": "First timer for dinner tonight. They were very friendly and the food was tasty! It's kind of like Subway-esque where they make the items for you, not like Sweet Tomatoes where you make your own. I had a large salad (cobb with ranch) and my hubby got the pulled pork and cauliflower cheese soup. We also splurged on a chocolate cake slice and rocky road brownie, cuz you know that is needed after a semi healthy salad :p On my cobb, I wanted to sub cucumbers for olives and asked for extra ranch. It felt like pulling teeth to get a substitution and extra dressing. Hubby asked for no cabbage on his sandwich, but got it anyway. His pulled pork sandwich was mostly cabbage. The little meat that was on the sandwich and they bread were really good though. My salad was crisp and fresh. The soup was decadent and creamy. We mostly just dunked the bread into the soup like it was fondue. So good. The meals came with a chocolate strawberry and bread which was tasty.  The brownie was super rich and my hubby who is a sweets-aholic could only eat a few bites. Same with the cake. I recommend splitting a dessert or just be happy with the strawberries lol. When ringing up they rang us for a salad and a separate soup. We almost didn't get our sandwich. They had already slid my card when I asked where our sandwich was and then they had to charge my card again for the difference.  All in all there is high hopes for this place after they get their grove on. I do wish they had a build your own salad instead of just subbing things on their current menu without having to do extra $.50 charges for adding simple things like tomato or cucumber.",

Diners walk up to a long buffet-style bar and order their food. Sandwiches are made fresh. Salads are put together in front of you and soups are kept warm in large soup warmers so service is quick and one is soon sitting down in the comfortable dining area and eating.  I have had their Lobster Bisque soup (which is divine). Their Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich really is the ultimate in decadence. I adore it.   Zupas offers a complimentary bread serving and a chocolate covered strawberry with each meal. It is a nice touch that I appreciate. (And both are wonderful treats, as well.)  I always get their Salted Caramel creme brulee. Whilst not a traditional brulee (a crunchy top you tap with a spoon) it is a marvelous concoction of creamy vanilla pudding topped with a luscious (soft) caramel topping and finished with whipped cream and a thin chocolate slice.  Every meal at Zupas has been great. This is what casual dining should be, everywhere.   Great food, pleasant atmosphere, well-valued pricing and a terrific location. It doesn't get better than this.",

There are plenty different types of soups to choose from  such as New England Clam Chowder, Tortilla Soup, and Chicken Noodle soup. They also make various kinds of hot and cold sandwiches such as a California Turkey sandwich and more. To top if off, they offer an extensive quantity of choices when it comes to desert. They have cheesecakes, brownies, cookies, and more.   The service is also great. When I was there, the staff was very attentive and friendly. It was my first time dining at Cafe Zupas and I was a little confused on how the process works. The staff was kind enough to explain how their \"cafeteria-line\" style works, so don't be overwhelmed by the amounts of dishes you have to choose from!  When it's near closing time, their desserts are half off.  Great job Cafe Zupas!",

The process is simple and even for a first-timer, it wasn't intimidating.  I opted for the Try 2 Combo ($8.79) with a sandwich and half bowl of soup.  California Turkey Sandwich: Turkey, avocado, tomato, sprouts, cucumber, mixed greens, Muenster cheese, and housemade sun-dried tomato herb spread. The ciabatta bread was nice and soft. I really like all the ingredients of this sandwich, but it lacked the salt to bring out its flavors.  Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup: Cauliflower, cheddar, and pepperjack. This is a wonderful option for a soup with a creamy feel without all the guilt! The amount of cheese isn't overwhelming and although you don't get that super smooth chowder-like feel, it still tastes great. It wouldn't be my favorite soup, but I love that it's low-carb.  With every meal, you receive a piece of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. It makes the price even sweeter. Both accompaniments are decent.  It's not an amazing meal and I wouldn't go out of my way to have it, but I guess if you're in a hurry and you're craving healthier sandwiches, soups, and/or salads, it's not terrible.",

    "text": "I could not decide on getting the lobster bisque or the roasted pepper lobster so I got both!   The lobster bisque was delicious, full of flavor, filled with more ingredients (think celery, lobster, etc. etc.) while the roasted pepper lobster soup had that nice flavor kick to it.  I prefer the latter.     Walking in, you're greeted by smiling staff at the door and you walk into a large, bright, clean room.  You make your orders going down the line (memories of high school cafeteria lol).  Besides the soup, I did half a sandwich with the crab pesto.  It was pretty good.  Not many places in town where you can get a real crab sandwich.   A chocolate covered strawberry added was a nice touch.     I also ordered a kid's meal for my daughter.  1/2 a cup of soup (she had the mushroom soup which was good) and two chicken fingers.   The weird thing is the kid's cup is like a regular plastic water cup you could buy at any store.  It didn't really work well with their plastic lids.  The first time I tried to push the lid down over the cup, it cracked the plastic cup causing a spill and I got my clothes wet.   Apparently a gentle, REALLY gentle push while supporting the upper half of the cup was necessary the 2nd time.    I would go back if I ever have a lobster soup craving as this was  one of the best I've had in Vegas.",

    "text": "My coworkers and I have ordered out from here a handful of times and each time the orders are right and the food is still fresh or warm when we receive it (we're about a 15 minute drive away).   First, as far as their options go, the food is fresh and I appreciate all the different tastes you have options for. If you're craving more Southwestern flavors for the day, no problem. If you're in the mood for warm, comfort food, they've got that, too.  This most recent time, I was in charge of picking up the food. I immediately was greeted with a smile and when I told them I wanted to place and take orders to go, an associate asked that I follow him to another register and told me the name of the other associate who would assist me. He gave me a drink while I waited and the ordering process was easy-peasy. They were a lot quicker than I thought they'd be since I walked in and placed my order vs. calling it in.  For a soup and sandwiches place, I felt like a Queen!   Tips: If you think you want to place a to-go order, do it early as there is a certain point in the day when they stop accepting carry out lunch orders.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to try out Cafe Zupas but never had the chance to but last night, I was lucky enough to come here with my family for dinner.   They have a menu filled with sandwiches, salads, and soups. The best part about them? $7.99 combos. You get your choice of two items -- full sandwich, half salad, half soup. So we all went for a combo.   I personally got the Honey Bacon Club panini, which had turkey, ham, smoked bacon, tomatoes, muenster cheese, and house-made honey mustard spread. Now, I've never been a huge salad person but they had so many different types of fruity salads. I just had to go for half of their Summer Chicken salad, which had chicken, fresh strawberries, cashews, dried cranberries, & grapes on a bed of mixed greens with house-made fresh strawberry vinaigrette dressing. Along with your full orders, you get bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.   Their sandwich? Not really all that memorable. It was quite thin. Don't get me wrong ... it was good but it wasn't great. I could've honestly just passed it up because their salad just out shined it by a few thousand miles.  I love strawberries so at the first bite of this summer chicken salad, I was in heaven. Why? Their strawberry vinaigrette dressing is to DIE FOR. It's amazing ..and the cashews add a nice touch of flavor into it as well. My goodness. I don't think I've had such an amazing salad elsewhere before.   I think I just found my favorite place. This place would be PERFECT for summer. I'm just craving their salads right now and will be coming back soon! VERY SOON! I can't wait to try all of their fruity salads!!",

It is rich, tangy, and just plain  delightful. This is my boyfriend's go-to. The taste can get overwhelming though when you get to the last third of it because it's so flooded with flavor that your taste buds get too tired and surrender.  I've only tried the NUTS ABOUT BERRIES salad, but didn't find anything particularly lasting about it. It looked and tasted fresh, and was still a sizable portion for it being half-sized.  As for sandwiches, I've had the PESTO CHICKEN and the HONEY CILANTRO CARNITAS. Nothing worth mentioning, really. I think what ruined it for me was the bread that they use. To me, it seems too dense and dry. The flattened sandwiches are bearable, but when it's regular, the bread just seems annoying. I ended up just completely removing the top bun off my last sandwich. Panera does bread better.  As for the beverage flavor bar they boast about, Cafe Rio beats them by a mile.   The complimentary chocolate-dipped strawberry and baguette slice is a nice touch, but again, the bread is forgettable. And sometimes you end up getting the baby strawberry. If you go here, the soup and perhaps salad is where it's at. Avoid the sandwiches!",

The tall blonde hair guy in the green shirt was the cashier today and he up-charged me an extra $2+ for my to-go kids meal that was for a kid at home... without even asking me if it was for an adult or child. If I hadn't looked at the price when I had walked in I would've been ripped off without knowing it. As I was leaving the restaurant I saw that a drink should have been included in the meal which had not been offered to me at all. So I had to go back in line and get one.   Good job cafe zupas for almost ripping me off twice in one encounter!",

The small soup, bread and 1/2 of the sandwich filled me up, so I took the other 1/2 for tomorrow's lunch :)  The chicken tortilla soup was slightly salty, but the flavor was still pretty good. On the other hand, the crab avocado sandwich could have used a little more salt, but again, still pretty good.  The complimentary chocolate covered strawberries are a fantastic touch! Nice end to the meal. They also have a cool drink bar where you can create your own specialty beverages. There are a few suggestions listed on the cup.  All in all, they do a great job of distinguishing themselves from Panera (or other similar concepts). Cheerful staff, bright, clean interior. Definitely coming back again soon!",

We were about to leave to find somewhere to get food faster but I come here sometimes and love it every time so I wanted to show it to my friend. It took a bit of time until we were able to sit down and eat but the wait was well worth it. The employees seemed like they were trying to be friendly but were too stressed about the somewhat large line of people. Aside from them, there was a young gentlemen (and I do mean *gentlemen*) named Dalton that made waiting so fun actually! This kid looked so young but was moving faster than any of his coworkers. Honestly, he looked like a dancer! He spins bottles and spatulas, twirls his hands so that it almost looks like he writes in cursive with the sauces on your sandwich, and he was so polite while also being funny when he'd spin around to ask if anyone in line wanted a soup. He was going so fast with everything. I came in again today and Dalton was there again. I just had to mention him because I really did enjoy watching this guy work. He was so fascinating. lol! He has a real passion for it. If you want dinner and a free show go in and look at the guy moving around at 500 miles an hour. Best visits ever. Got my friend hooked on the strawberry harvest salad just as much as I am!",

I was surprised because their prices are SO reasonable to begin with!  She signed me up for rewards, which gave me $15 credit for the order, to be used next visit.  The receipt was in a nice hand written envelope, and here is the real shocker... There was no place for a tip, \"we don't accept tips\"!!!

They are fast, efficient, and keep the place clean. I like the flavorings you can put in the sodas. The chocolate dipped strawberry is a nice touch. I've tried several soups and they are amazing.  Negatives? Sandwiches are small for the price. The chocolate dipped strawberry is often under-ripe. The bread that comes with the soup is awful, just bad texture, and it's so easy to get good bread! Soups are never hot enough. Salads are okay, nothing spectacular, and the chicken in them tastes off. The desserts are terrible, the brulees are nothing but a pudding or custard with some runny sauce masquerading as caramel or a few berries with a runny berry sauce. The brownie was hard. When you consider how much you've paid, you realize you've not gotten much food. And very little of it is great.",

    "text": "This place is outstanding!  I usually don't write reviews for chain restaurants and franchises, but this place was so good that I think people in Las Vegas should know about it.  At first, I thought this place would be like a Panera.  It serves the same types of food as Panera, but the quality is significantly superior.    I've been here twice, and each time I got the Pick 2 option for $7.99.  This includes a full-size sandwich and a salad or soup.  I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich both times, and I had the vegetable soup on one occasion and the MangoBerry salad on the other.  All of these items were excellent.  the MangoBerry salad was the best salad I've had in a long time.  It's actually a very healthy salad, but I felt like I was eating candy.  The soup was also really good.  They also have a very extensive soda selection, and additional flavors of syrup that you can squirt into your soda to give it unique tastes.  The complementary chocolate covered strawberry is also a very nice touch.    There's a very modern, clean feel to this restaurant.  They have a \"recharge station\" where you can plug in your laptop or cell phone.  It seems like the type of place where they wouldn't mind if you want to come and work on your laptop for a while.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because their employees are a little overly-friendly.  From the second you walk in to the place, there's a person holding the door open for you, and all too eager to tell you about what's on the menu and how to order.  Whoever owns this place would do well to tell the employees to back off just a little and give customers a chance to look up at their menu on their own and take it all in.  This is definitely a great place with nice atmosphere and good food at great prices.  I'll come here again.",

I was impressed by the wide variety of food that Cafe Zupas offers and I was relatively satisfied with my food. However, my partner did not have the same experience. We asked for no tomatoes, peppers, or cheese on our salad and it was made incorrectly along with her sandwich, despite us being the only customers in line. The staff was lukewarm and was cleaning when we came in. I understand how food service works, I'm a young adult and I've worked in the industry before. However, the employees we're preoccupied with cleaning, the two \"supervisors or managers\" managed the employees, yet neglected to act as inviting members of Zupas. The employees were not very friendly and my girlfriends meal was not up to par. I understand that food may not always be exactly as we expect, but there is no excuse for the level of service we received. We weren't even checked on during our meal. It would require a longtime before I consider trying this location again. Employees continued chatting and socializing before the open sign was even turned off. Disappointed to receive this level of service and I've worked for restaurants before.",

Their price is very reasonable and cheaper than other places like panera or corner bakery.  They have a good price on a combo deal for $7.99  I usually pick a sandwich and half soup.  My favorite soup there is Roasted Red Pepper and Lobster soup and my favorite sandwich is the turkey bacon avocado.  The place is setup like a cafeteria style where you order in line and your food will be given to you at the cash register once it is done and you go find a table to sit down on.  When the place is busy a worker will help you find a table and they also clean up your mess for you when you are done eating.  Try stopping by and giving this place a chance",

    "text": "Requires further inspection...  Cafe Zupas is a hot-spot for lunch. Salads, sandwiches, and soups are the stars of the show. The strangely unsettling amount of customer-service is somewhat of a put-off, but not so much I wouldn't go back. The interior is nice enough with a lot of seating, booths and tables.   I'm not thoroughly impressed because for one the salad I ordered failed completely on pretty much every level except for that fact that is was HUGE and way too much of it for me to eat in one sitting, especially since I had ordered a salad/soup combo. Combos are the way to go though, soup/salad, salad/sandwich, sandwich/soup, etc.   Salad: Yucatan Chipotle Chicken Salad - served with a few strips of dried-out chicken breasts, olives, way too many tortilla strips, guacamole (that was spilling over the side of the bowl), a few black beans, a few olives, and a \"chipotle\" sauce, which did not taste like chipotle and did not add any flavor at all to the salad. Overall this salad is a huge let-down. Try a different salad other than this one.  Lobster Bisque - Decent enough soup, decent enough portion. I finished the soup, mainly because I wasn't thrilled with the salad. They have saltine crackers AND the cute little clam crackers available by the drink station for your soups. I though this soup was all right for the fact its Lobster Bisque at a quick dining spot. Others have complained of it being overly-sweet or not having enough lobster... but c'mon, it's not like you're sitting in a fine-dining establishment on the Strip. For what it is, it's good. I'd order it again.  Price-point - About the same as Panera Bread, but you are getting a bit more bang for your buck here in my opinion. A two-item combo and a fountain soda cost me a little over 10 bucks.   I think I'll try again, solely based off the fact they have a really extensive menu and so many pairing options I am sure I am bound to find something that I really like.",

I wasnt offered a sandwich (and not knowing how it works, i didnt ask) instead i stood like a deer in headlights. Someone asked me if i wanted a salad, i said kale & quinoa. Only to be told they were out of quinoa. I added chicken instead. When my wife noticed i hadnt ordered a sandwich, i told her nobody asked me if i wanted one or what i wanted other then the salad. In the mean time the people behind the line were yelling for salads and other stuff and dropping containers on the floor. It seemed a bit messy. My wife mentioned to a girl that i wanted a sandwich, but ny now i was over it and just wanted to get to the register. As we paid and went to walk away to find a seat an employee came out of the kitchen area only to bump into me and just kept walking, no acknowledgement what so ever. Any other time i would have ignored it, but this day i was carrying my 4 day old daughter, now I was IRATE. I talked to a \"manager\" and she seemed to not care, but did tell me that, she will talk to the employees boss and probably send them home and they will reconsider their employment with the company. (I was a bit confused on why she needed to share that information with me)  All in all The salad i had was good My wife likes the sandwiches And I may consider returning, but it will NOT be to this location",

My first impression was that it was spacious and everyone was super friendly, I mean they open the door for you and are ready with recommendations. I immediately decided on the pick 2 combo, for the price it seemed like a bargain. The Asian BBQ sandwich sounded amazing and I heard the roasted cauliflower soup was fantastic, so I ordered it up. I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal.   I was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.  Overall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order. The customer service is fantastic, in fact when my husband and I were there they were giving away their daily customer service award to one of their team members - how cool! I can't wait to try some more soups and maybe even a salad next time. This is definitely a welcome addition to the Henderson scene.",

To start off the soup was very thin with very little ingredients and at 7 dollars for this bowl of soup is not worth it to me. The only good thing is that the soups flavoring was pretty good and had a good kick to it other than that skip the soup here.",

They had a greeter which was kinda weird. She literally just opened the door. It wasn't busy when I was there which might of made her standing there awkward.   I hate sandwiches so I didn't bother trying the veggie sandwich. I did try the ultimate grilled cheese which had cheese, tomatoes, and pesto. After trying ALL the veggie soup options, I came to conclusion to get the cauliflower soup. It was unique and my first time trying it. Perfect idea to dip your grilled cheese in. My friend love it and eats it. the soup is too thick for me to just eat by itself. If I wanted just soup, I would of picked one more with just veggies and a broth.   To top off this awesome experince, they give everyone a complemetary chcocolate covered strawberry with your meal. I will definetly be returning.",

For a few weeks I watched the corner of Eastern Ave and Richmar Ave, develop into this bright red decored restaurant advertising soups, salads, and sandwiches. Definitely a place I needed to try!  I ventured over there this past Friday, and found it absolutely amazing! I was greeted at the door by an employee who was extremely friendly and knew the menu well. I tried the Nuts over Berries salad, which was incredibly fresh and the crushed cinnamon almonds definitely offered a pizzaz!  And if that wasn't enough to make this experience memorable, it came with a chocolate covered strawberry!   New.  Favorite.  Place.",

You can definitely tell they just opened because everyone was SUPER helpful and friendly, and the place was as clean as can be.  I was unsure about which soup I wanted because they all sound awesome, and they let me sample a couple.  Be sure to ask for a sample if you don't know which one you want!  I ended up getting the red pepper and lobster, and my husband got the lobster bisque.  Mine was better!  haha.  But they were both delicious.  I also got the California Turkey sandwich, and my husband got the BBQ pulled pork--both good.  LOVED the chocolate-covered strawberry that came with my meal.  It's a good deal for $7.99.  Next time I'm going to try a salad.  Anyway, I recommend this place.  It's really good, cheap, and yummy.  I would be here every single day if I worked nearby and needed a lunch spot.  Try it!",

We got 1 kids grilled cheese that came with fruit and 2 mix n match meals: crab avocado melt and asian pork sandwich, mushroom soup and gumbo. These came with a bread and strawberry. Bread was soft and strawberry was pretty good. Was disappointed because people in front of us got last creme brule and they had none ready...boo! We got the nut bar instead and to me it was too sweet. Good variety of drinks and sugar free options as well. Our total was under $25. Overall we'd be back but next time we hope the hype dies Down a bit. People couldn't find seating and the floors were wet from all the people dripping their drinks, etc on the floor. Soups need to be a bit hotter.....lets hope next time we can bump up a star.",

Again, tasted great, but c'mon guys, give us a little more substance to our sandwiches!  I had the Try 2 combo.  Chicken pesto panini & Roasted red pepper lobster soup. The food is delicious. The soup was fantastic. The panini was also great, but I felt like it was lacking ingredients. Don't get me wrong, the mixture of ingredients is great.....but I feel like it could have been a \"thicker\" sandwich. That's the only thing I felt a bit jipped on.   The customer service is great. There are a ton of people behind the counter. And every single one of them smiles at you and tells you to have a good day. A bit of an overload, but it's better than poor customer service.   I'd give them 5 stars of they made Nutrition information available...which seems reasonable for a place that specializes in salad, soup, and sandwiches. And the sandwich just needs a little more \"umph\" to it.",

I then tell her then why is it on the menu and why they waited for us to get all the way down to you without making us aware and giving us the opportunity to order another sandwich.

This was my second trip back to NV since I'm getting ready to move out their for good soon :/ My grandma has been raving about this place since my first trip but unfortunately they were closed on Sundays. I knew I'd be back soon so I finally go to try it and I LOVED it!!  Since I've had stomach issues over the last year I don't eat as much and tend to crave soup ALOT! Even when its summer I will still eat soup I just love it! This place is perfect for me! They have all kinds of salads/paninis/soups to choose from! I went with the Strawberry salad with extra candied pecans and extra dressing on the side, everything was DELICIOUS!! The chicken they use is so fresh and the strawberries were too! Especially since it's not strawberry season anymore!   For the soup I went with the chicken tortilla, it has nice chunks of fresh chicken too! I just don't like how they charge you for tortilla strips, the strips are just a given when you think of chicken tortilla soup, so they tack on that and they charge you for cheese :/  I guess the food makes up for it because everything tasted great! I even took a dessert home which did not agree with me (it was too rich/decadent for my tummy LOL) I didn't even taste my chocolate strawberry since I got too full!   My mom and I shared all of this deliciousness for only $14.00! I know this is going on my food rotation once I move out there LOL!  I'm in love with Cafe Zupas! ^___^",

I went with a friend and we both got the combo where you can pick two items out of a soup, salad, and sandwich for around $8. You order up front (got that Subway feel; you can see the workers whip up the food in front of you) and the workers are incredibly friendly! It took literally less than a minute to get our order.   I got the Crab Avocado Melt and the Kale Quinoa Salad. The salad was tossed in a sweeter dressing with chopped kale, quinoa, pistachios, fresh blueberries, tomatoes, dried raspberries, and grated Parmesan on top. SO delicious and quite a large portion! The sandwich was deliciously cheesy and had crab salad, avocado and bacon in it. You also get a small baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry (nice touch) with the combo.  It was a great, filling lunch and less than $20 for two people. I'll definitely be back!",

Items ordered were chicken enchilada chili (amazing!), glazed chicken chipotle salad (delish), berry salad (great), kids grilled cheese sandwich (great), California sandwich (great), chicken tortilla soup (excellent).  The place was clean and like I said way packed, but it was pretty organized and well stocked. The manager was manning the register and doing his best to get the food up and paid and customers off as quickly as possible.  I was pleased with the quality and service, price for 4 to eat combo meals (sandwich/soup or sandwich/salad) was about $39.00.  I'd definitely go back.",

There is a pretty good selection of salads, they have several soups (10) choices, sandwiches as some desert.  Like I said I opted for just a bowl of soup which to my surprise came with bread and a somewhat chocolate covered strawberry; well the tip of the strawberry had chocolate on it.  Overall it was good, my friend has been here several times and really likes it.  I would really love it if everything was organic but its not, however this place still puts out some great food for eating in or taking home.  There is plenty of seating and they even have free wifi and a charging bar for your devices with a plug and two usb outlets in about 5 different spots.

I ordered the sandwich & soup combo and I was excepting half a sandwich like how other restaurants do. However, I received a full sandwich, a full bowl of soup, bread, and a chocolate covered strawberry. My mom got the same thing, except she got a salad.   The food was very tasty & filling. I'd definitely go back here! I wish they had a location on the west side of town.",

I'm pretty disappointed as I love this sandwich and it's a shame I won't be going back everyone knows avocado is expensive but this is another level of cheap. The saving grace was the free strawberry but even those have gotten smaller and smaller each time I come. I guess it's time to go to panara bread instead.:/",

The staff was everywhere to be found-- one person opened the door and greeted you right away, one person was there to help with suggestions or questions about the food, people going down the \"assembly line\" when ordering and a few more at the register!   They have a good list of soups, salads and sandwiches to choose from -- and if you want you can do a combo, you choose two for $7.99!   I'm not a salad fan at all .. but I LOVE CAFE ZUPAS salads! I can seriously eat it all day! The few salads I've had are the : Nuts about Berries and the MangoBerry!  Yes! I love the sweeter salads! The nuts, berries/fruits and dressing mix so well with each other, it's the perfect pair with a more savory sandwich or soup! In my case I like their Clam Chowder! Creamy with just the right amount of clams, chunks of potatoes and topped with bacon!  I've had a couple bites of their sandwiches and they're ok. Good but nothing that stands out!  Their dishes come with bread and a chocolate covered strawberry!  They have a whole display of desserts (cakes, brownies, cookies and creme brulees) I have yet to try out!  Very affordable, healthy, and great for lunch dates!",

So i read the as \"zapatos\" at first which made me think it was a really odd name for a restaurant since \"shoes\" isn't something you'd associate with food... anyway moving on.   So the name got my attention at first, jumped on yelp and solid reviews.  F it... let's give it a shot.. wow... menu appears a tad overwhelming at first even though it's not overly complicated.  The combos are definitely worth your money, with 1/2 soup/salad with a sandwich for $7.99 or so.    Had the HBC and the asian peanut salad thing (forget what it's called, too lazy to look at their menu).. both were stellar and worth repeating.  They let you sample all the soup you want and so far I haven't been disappointed.  The lobster bisque and the tortilla soup were both excellent.  The girlfriend liked the few diff salads she's tried and the veg sandwich.    The place is super quick with your food and travels pretty damn well for the to-go orders.  They always give a chocolate covered strawberry with your order which... eh.. isn't always the freshest... it's \"free\" with your order so not going to knock anything down for that.  Anyway... in short... good food... it's fast... def place worth repeating.",

I could probably just order a couple bowls of this bisque and be happy! It's delicious! Their salads are good, but they'd be better if they didn't skimp on the toppings.Their sandwiches are served on a nice pannini bread with enough filling to satisfy. With the soups and salads, you also get a slice of fresh baguette....and always a chocolate-covered strawberry to finish. They have some amazing desserts, but the Creme Brulee is to die for!",

It seems they are always training some one new to make the salads and they have not been making them the same every time.  Today I got 3 croutons no big deal, but my wife got her salad and it was half the size of mine.  The bus person asked if everything was ok I said my wife's salad was a little small, she got a manager which my wife did not want, I opened my mouth.  When the manager came over she gave the excuse of its because of the different type of lettuce and it takes the dressing differently.  She said the district manager was there and if we wanted to talk to him, my wife said no so we could enjoy our meal.  The only reason I'm writing this is because the district manager helped make the salads.  We really are not ones to complain, I contemplated on writing this and giving it three stars, but I hope he reads this and maybe not work on the line but watch the quality control that's leaving the line.        Enough negative, for the positive and why I gave 4 stars is the food does taste good and the staff is friendly, it's always clean.  If they get and stay consistent I will give them 5 stars.",

    "text": "Although I dislike spending more than $10 for lunch, I had to give it to Cafe Zupas- this was WELL worth the $11 price tag!! Apparently, I just missed the lunchtime rush, because when I arrived, it was nearly empty, but there was a pretty long line when I walked out of the door.   The restaurant is extremely clean and bright, which is always a plus. They have a wide variety of soups, salads and sandwiches. The soups are pre-made, but you can get a variety of add-ons, such as bacon bits, croutons, etc. The sandwiches are made to order, and they fix the salads right in front of you.  I decided to get the \"pick 2 combo\" with the lobster bisque and the crab and avocado melt sandwich. With a drink,  I was at an $11 lunch. I was mentally grumbling under my breath until I saw the size of the bowl of soup, the hunk of bread for dipping, the beautiful sandwich, and the chocolate covered strawberry for dessert! WOW!  When I took my first sip of the soup... I thought I'd gone to heaven! I seriously could have taken a bath in that lobster bisque! Rich, creamy, full of flavor and lobster. Just that alone would have been worth close to $10. The sandwich was just as good, full of crab, tomato, avocado and bacon strips. I especially appreciated that the bread, while warm and toasty, was not hard and crunchy (I have a fundamental opposition to crunchy, hard bread). I had to exercise some restraint and ask for a box so I could have the other half for dinner.   The employees of the restaurant were all very nice and friendly and they will bus your table for you. I don't get out to Hender-tucky very often, but Zupas will be on my return list for lunch!",

Over the past 6 months the customer service has been terrible. we kept going back because the food was good. but lately they have been messing up orders as well as being extremely rude. if you ask for no tomatoes you get an eye roll from 3 people. we will not be eating here anymore. Ill try back in a few months to see if they have gotten new staff.",

The kids meal prices are great and I enjoy the beverage area. I love the  complimentary chocolate cover strawberry and slice of bread. I swear I'm always like a dog staring at my kids while they shovel down carbs. I myself always get the bbq chicken salad, but I have to tell them to go was on the dressing. Sometime they get a little heavy handed. If you going give extra make it chicken not dressing. Just kidding. I'd say this place is great for a quick bite if you're looking for something fresh and reasonably priced. Me likey!",

I would have definitely given it 4 stars.   Not all good things last though. I recently went for the 3rd time and was very disappointed. First off they had decided to discontinue the sale of some of their very good sandwiches including the Thai peanut sandwich and Asian Pork sandwich. I particularly liked these sandwiches because they tasted great and they were unique. I had another sandwich which was just ok. In addition, the clam chowder was now very watery. I probably will not be back.  I do have to point out though that the customer service is always very good and they have other food choices but after their decisions about what they are excluding it just left a bad taste in my mouth (figuratively).",

It's confusing at first, but after coming in once, you get used to it. They also have this cool \"soda bar\" near their soda machines, and you are able to mix in flavors into lemonades and sodas to create your own drink! It's pretty neat.  Another plus is that they give you a slice of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry with every single meal! I absolutely love the fact that we always get a small treat after.  The only downfall is that you have to repeat your order again before you pay for your meal to confirm which food you got, which gets repetitive after coming more than twice.  Overall, it's a healthier fast food option, and the food is always tasty.",

They give u complimentary bread wi th your soup as well as chocolate covered strawberries with your order.  Yum!

    "text": "4.9 Stars  Location Overview: This location is in a great strip mall on Eastern. It definitely has a the new business feeling to it. As soon as you walk in you can tell that everything is brand new and clean. Most definitely give them 5.0 Star for the over all view of this location. However, the concept is a little confusing. You pick either a soup and sandwich, soup and salad, or a sandwich and salad. When you are in line you kind of have to jump ahead of people depending on what meal you choose or you have to go to the end of the line again.   Customer Service: Customer service at this location is decent. After looking at the menu, you get in line and the first person asks if they can make you a salad or a sandwich. Once you have chosen your salad and/or sandwich you choose your soup if that is your other entree. They give you testers for the soup (great choices for meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans). Once you have gotten your entree you get a big piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry (which is DELICIOUS) and an extra charger for your drink if you choose to get one.   **********As my first time here I was excited to try this place because my parents have gone to this location several times and have experienced great service. I am not sure if the young man was confused but my boyfriend and I ordered the same thing and we actually wind up missing a sandwich. So we waited about 5 minutes and no one said anything. After we told a manager at the cash register about the other sandwich that we were missing she took care of it right away.   Quantity/Quality: The Honey Bacon Club sandwich is a good choice. It has a sweet taste from honey mustard. The bacon is crispy The turkey and ham slices are tender. I got the New England Clam Chowder. I added bacon bites to my soup and it most definitely is a great choice of soup. The quality of the food is definitely fresh and great. I would have to say that the quality of the food here is just as good as a 5 Star High End restaurant. The quantity of the food is more than enough. you get two entrees a big piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry as well as your drink. My father is around 185lbs and he gets full on this.   Side Notes: Great for a lunch/dinner date. Kids menu has a good quantity of food. Expect to leave full and satisfied.",

Got the Lobster Bisque, I was excited because I love Lobster Bisque, this is NOT Lobster Bisque, it should be called creamy vegetable soup, no seafood flavor and not a hint of Lobster. I really thought that Bon Chef Cafe had the worst Lobster Bisque I ever had, but Cafe Zupas topped them. I suggest the owners go try Ventano's Lobster Bisque, so they know what real Lobster Bisque tastes like.  The salad I picked was Chopped chicken salad. If there was an ounce of meat in this I would be surprised, also got it with Blue Cheese dressing, again if there was an ounce of dressing on it I would be surprised, flavorless salad and vegetable soup is not what I ordered, but it is what I received.    Finally with this fabulous meal, we received Bread and what they call Chocolate dipped Strawberries. The bread is like a thick slice of Wonder Bread. The Chocolate dipped strawberries are dipped on one side, but once you try it you are glad they didn't cover the whole strawberry in that cheap waxy chocolate.",

On the upside, most of the soups are very good, and I really like the grilled Panini sandwiches - especially the chicken pesto.

I ordered the mushroom bisque after having samples of the lobster and cauliflower. Needless to say, I prefer Campbell's mushroom soup from the can. I got the pick 2 combo, turkey bacon avocado. Again, first bite I was disappointed. For some reason, the sandwich was sweet? I asked for regular yellow mustard, and when I opened my sandwich the bread looked like it was drizzled with honey. I literally took a few bites and called it quits. My boyfriend and sisters, also not impressed. Only thing my boyfriend liked was the sauce they used on his Italian club. I did enjoy the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry though. Definitely made the lunch better. Sadly, I will not be returning.

The second time I ate in and got their chicken pesto which was amazing! They also give you free chocolate covered strawberries :) oh and there is free wifi!",

    "text": "Not sure what first caught my eye about this place, but something did.  I'd been wanting to go to this place for awhile now.   I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.    However, seeing as this seems to be a fairly new place, I'm willing to get them a second try when I'm feeling 100%, rather than just 90%.",

The customer service here is always superb. Now for this type of quality you do have to pay a couple bucks extra but it's worth it. I love everything there from their sandwiches, soups, salads, dessert and drinks. Now keep in mind I don't eat here on the regular cause it is pricey for my wallet. I usually do lots of catering orders for my office. I love that everyone can get box lunches and make them specific to them. You can pick from 2 items from cup of soup,salad,sandwich. It comes with a chocolate covered strawberry or cookie. For catering they don't offer any of their infused drinks which sucks cause I would get a gallon of each. They did mess up a couple catering orders but since I called and spoke to the catering manager they did apologized and rewarded me for the inconvenience. These last 2 catering orders have been perfect.",

You get to pick what you want and see your meal come together right in front of you. Their ingredient are really fresh and everything taste delicious. I like to create my own salad. You get to pick your greens and 5 toppings. I like to get mixed greens with bacon, Parmesan cheese, dried cranberries, apples, mango, and fresh herb vinaigrette. I usually get the pick two combo so I get the Clam Chowder soup with my salad.  My biggest critique about Cafe Zupas is that they are really stingy! Ideally, they are supposed to give one full scoop of each topping, but they always get me less than half a scoop. Their food is more expensive than other salad bars so I get mad when I see them being cheap. Staff is always stuck up and rude to their customers. I usually just get my food togo so I don't have to deal with their employees for too long.",

Maybe due to so many new people there. My last two visits here took about 20min compared to the usual 4-5min because the new sandwich makers just forgot to make one of my sandwiches. Both times.    I hope they aren't going to run like this forever because I usually really enjoy everything here but have been recently disappointed due to management making too many changes at once with poor integration.",

They offer a hefty mixture of salads, soups, sandwiches and some sweet treats. Make sure to ask for a sample of their soups while you're in line. You order at the counter and grab your grub before you hunt for a table.   I've been here a handful of times and have thrown this spot into my work lunch rotation. It's a great option for my coworker crowd because everyone can pick out something they like without a scuffle. You can build your own salad or choose one of their customs mixes. Want light dressing? No problem-o. Want spinach vs romaine? Done. Want extra toppings? Sure, but it might cost you a little bit - just ask to clarify before you load up.   I generally order a flavorful salad filled with nutritious and tasty fillings like spinach and berries. I also always enjoy their soup and try a few flavors before deciding on what I want for the day.  They have items that rotate seasonally so it's a nice touch that they let you sample before you pick one out. Their friendly service and fresh eats will have me coming back.   Tip: Expect a hefty lunch line on the weekdays. They do a great job on keeping the line moving rather quickly.... so don't let that stop you from trying them out.  Also, enjoy their chocolate covered strawberry they provide with every order.",

They also are good about making sure you understand how \"hot\" the spicy levels of their dishes are.  Everything is fresh, full of flavor and made in front of your eyes.  Prices are encouraging, not big, and portions are large.",

Option to bulk order or to let everyone choose is great, all through the website. They have their own delivery people who were easy to work with, much less cumbersome than if they used a third party. Expansive variety and awesome customization options. Good value for chips, cookie and a main. Small gripe was that it was hard for me to tell if something could be made vegan or gluten free.",

They toss your salads in front of you, the soups are ready made and they ladle it into bowls while you wait. The sandwiches are grilled panini style and are made by the time you pay.  I have been here several times and to me the food was a bit average. The only two things that impressed me were the use of Winder Farms butter and the chocolate dipped strawberries. On our visit today, we noticed no Winder Farms butter and chocolate dipped Oreos instead of strawberries. What's happening here?  I had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup and it was, eh... Average. I also ordered the Cobb salad, it was also, eh.  I love Cobb salads and it is my go to salads at restaurants  I can't do it, sorry folks.",

They have soup, sandwiches and salads. I wanted something fresh and healthy so I ordered a chicken salad with berries & grapes and stuff. It sounded good but the reality of it was pretty pitiful. It had 3 strips of chicken on it, like 1 strawberry and a few grapes. Something tasted freezer burnt. It was so bland & sad. There's no pride in the preparation. Its made in an assembly line. Someone puts on 1-2 ingredients, then passes it to the next person who adds a couple ingredients. I'm sure its to expedite the process but what ends up happening is food is just thrown together. And as we all know... We eat with our eyes first.   After a few bites, I had no interest in continuing with the salad. So I opted for the BBQ Pork Sandwich. It was fine. Edible but not great.   Personally I'm not likely to go back. I'll get my soup/ salad fix at Sweet Tomatoes.",

It was busy, but the staff at the counter took the time to explain things and let us taste a few of the soups, which was very helpful.   I had the chicken enchilada chili and the BBQ chicken salad. Both were great. My mother in law loved her food as well. The meal also came with a chocolate covered strawberry. It actually was a lot of food.

I understand its grilled I get that but smashed is not what it should be ...anyhow , thank God for the 50 c/o of mailer because my mediocre , smashed sandwich and soup would have been $ 10.86 instead of the five dollars I paid for it ! So that was a relief . The hundreds of screaming brats running around was such an added pleasure ! NOT ! I'll stick with paying for real deli sandwiches !

I would say my favorites are the mushroom and lobster bisque. They also have a really good variety of salads which are also delicious.   I really like this place but the reasons for my 3 star rating is because of the sandwiches and the conveyer belt style ordering system. It is a very mechanical system. This would work if there was better communication among the staff. Almost every time the last person I talk to is asking me what I ordered and has to scramble back down the line to find out. Also If you only do 3 things (soups, salad, sandwiches) then you should be able to pay more attention to detail. The sandwiches are sub par and not put together very well. I would recommend if you come here to stick to the soup and salad.",

Fresh, made to order food on demand...I'm a fan! I recommend the pick 2 combo for $7.99. We ordered the lobster bisque served with asiago cheese croutons, Asian BBQ pulled pork sandwich, Nuts about Berries salad and Tomato basil soup with orzo.  The lobster bisque was chunky with vegetables and surprisingly good but no lobster meat in sight. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. Crispy vegetables with sweet pulled pork on a soft bun. I would definitely get it again. The berries salad was fresh and lettuce was not wilted, yay. The tomato basil soup was sweet, creamy with a hint of spice that reminded me of curry. I would have given 4 stars but I got a little sick after eating here. Not sure if it was the food or iced tea. In any event, I like the concept and the extensive menu selections. Will be back!",

The Eastern Avenue Zupas is down the street from one of my gyms so it was easy to plan a post-workout dinner there with a few good friends.  We arrived on Tuesday night at 7:00pm and the place was busy but not packed as I've heard it can be at lunch time, i.e., there were tables available.  This place gets so crowded at times that there are signs on the table advising you not to save seats--that's a new one for me.  There is an extensive menu of sandwiches, salads, and soups, as well as some great-looking desserts.  Customers get in line and order before sitting down at booths or tables.  I already knew I wanted to try the lobster bisque, so I got the Try 2 Combo, which is only $7.99.  I paired the soup with the turkey cranberry sandwich.  You get a dinner roll and a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal, too--not bad for the price at all.  I really liked the bisque--not too salty, and my sandwich was also tasty.  I probably enjoyed the strawberry the most, and I got to eat two, benefiting from the b/f's allergy to fruit--more for me, sweetie.  I will definitely be back --now I'm really looking forward to the one in my 'hood to open.",

I will be back again and again!  There are so many options and for $8, you can get a whole sandwich and a half salad or half soup. There is nothing half about the latter--they are huge. You get more than enough food for $8. I got the ultimate grilled cheese with some chipotle salad, and to end the meal a pistachio \"creme brulee.\" Every bite was excellente of every thing.   The creme brulee is less of a creme brulee and more of a pudding. Didn't stop me though...I still nearly licked the bowl clean.  Can't wait to go back and check out more offerings and potentially bring in a laptop for a late afternoon work session? I Lovez Zupaz.",

    "text": "I really enjoy this place and have frequented it since they first opened here in Henderson. Service is always nice, but I'm not a huge fan of the line system. You usually have to repeat your order 2-3 times before you're done paying, which is not a big deal but can get a little bothersome when you've ordered several things or when it's very busy (mix-ups and misses can happen easily).  The main reason my review is less than five stars is because they don't offer nutrition information. I've asked at the restaurant and have also tried to find it on their online website. Given the amount of locations this restaurant has, I feel that I should be able to easily find this information, but unfortunately cannot.  Although prices have gone up slightly since this location first opened, I think the food here is still a good value for what you pay, especially if you order the combo. My favorite picks are the honey bacon club and enchilada soup (+ tortilla strips). They also have a bunch of flavored syrups for your drink, which is a nice plus if you like that sort of thing. Also, I love that a chocolate strawberry is added to every order! Great place for a simple and satisfying lunch.",

    "text": "Five-stars for five reasons:  1. Service is amazing. Someone is always at the front door to greet you, lead you in, and ask if you need any of their recommendations. When it's your first time here, it really helps eliminate confusion and makes you feel less rushed to pick all of the great choices they have on their menu. You go down a line of people, each at their food stations and ready to prepare your meal! They've got quite a system lined up, and it totally works. You'll see what I mean. With that said...  2. Salads, sandwiches, and soups galore! I get the Try 2 Combo for $7.99 any time I go. It's gives you so much freedom of choice and is a dirt cheap deal for what you are getting. You can get soup and salad, or salad and a sandwich... You get it. The big plus? IT IS ALL HEALTHY. You also receive a slice of French bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry with the meal to top it all off.  ***My recommendation is the Mango Berry Salad and the Pesto Chicken Panini. I am obsessed with both.  3. There is tons of seating. Booths line the windows and there are tables spaced out on the open floor. There is even a \"charge\" bar for your phones and laptops with little mini touch screens in front of you to play with. They have free wifi, although I haven't gone there for business- always for pleasure in the yummy food! Then again, I find it great  that customers are provided that option.  4. This is definitely a place for socialization for me, and is also family-oriented. I mentioned booths lining the windows because at each corner there are these huge booths that could probably seat 6-8 people at least! I like that fact for some odd reason. Maybe it's because any time I've been here, I am either catching up with friends, planning events to do later in the week, or sitting down with my other half and discussing how my day was. That's the kind of eating environment Zupas gives me- one where I can really sit down and ENJOY my meal.  5. I have never been disappointed, and sometimes that is hard to come by. I leave happy and full and.. plain old satisfied. ALSO, hard to come by. I am so glad its locations is so close to home for me. It has some competition for sure, considering the high volume of other restaurants located along Eastern Ave. But once you try it, you may think a little differently in that sense, and become a regular like me!   P.S. Don't panic when you find there are no trash cans to discard your waste or areas to place your bowls, plates and utensils! I think they do this on purpose. It's their way of saying.. \"Don't worry about it, I've got it and I'll take care of it. Have a nice day!\" :)",

The menu looks great and everything was reasonably priced. We both ordered a soup and sandwich combo to-go. Everything was nicely presented, even in a takeout box. I LOVE my mushroom bisque and my fiance really liked his lobster bisque. I haven't tried my honey bacon club yet because I'm stuffed from the soup and bread. My fiance liked his California club very much also.  The desserts looked amazing, but we rekunctabtly walked away with ordering any... Although we were greatly surprised when we found two chocolate covered strawberries in our takeout order!  We would definitely come here again. The salads sound amazing so that is what I will try if there is a next time.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas.....I want to like you, but I think we are done.  My lunch today was far from stellar.  Here is a basic breakdown-  1. This place now has a \"B\" from the SNHD.  I almost turned around and left based on that.  How hard is it to keep it clean and store your food properly?  2. The ordering process is a lesson in inefficiency.  Too many hands in the cookie jar.  They had eight employees behind the line and I bet they can do better with four.  First you have to tell the salad person what you want.  Then you have to tell a sandwich person what you want, and then you have to tell the soup person what you want.  After all this, you now have to repeat the order to someone organizing it.  Finally, you have to repeat your order AGAIN to the person checking you out.  Seriously?  Who thought of this?  Why on earth can't you just order everything from the first person and then pay without having to repeat it all?  It's called a POS system, use it!  3. I have been here about a dozen times.  After the second visit, I quit ordering sandwiches altogether.  They are as hard as rocks, bland, and comprised of cold cuts I can buy at any grocery store.  4. The salads are large, even for a half size, and a good deal.  Nothing off the charts, but good.  I mean, it is a salad.  5. The soups are good as well, except on a few occasions.  My tomato soup today had an aftertaste of seafood.  This may be where the \"B\" from the food inspection comes into play.  They are likely not storing their soups properly, or mixing utensils.  Be very careful of this place if you have a seafood allergy.  There is no way they can verify that occasionally things get mixed up.  Especially when you have so many people prepping orders.  6. This place is very good for kids.  That's about it.  For me, there are just too many other places in Vegas to get soup, salads, and sandwiches.  Next time I am in this shopping area I will be trying Smash Burger or the wood fired pizza place.  I'm putting Cafe Zupas on the back burner for the foreseeable future.",

I got their creme brulee and the top had solidified from being refrigerated for too long.  3. Every booth had dirty plates on it. Granted, there's a trashcan for people to discard their food, but clearly many had not done that. Instead the dirty plates just sat there and no one came by to clean them up.

It's like Panera meets Chipotle for soups, salads, and sandwiches.  A friend and I both got the combo thingy, full sandwich and 1/2 soup or salad. There were tons of options, so it's easy to find something everyone likes. I ended up with the HBC (honey bacon club) sandwich and summer chicken salad. The HBC was smaller than I thought but actually filling. It was a panini and came out super fast, warm, and was melty & cheesy. The salad was also yummy, refreshing, and a larger portion than I thought. It was hard finishing both items, but I got them down without feeling like I hated my life.   I did notice there were tons of people behind the counter. Like, TONS. There was a person to hand my food to the other person to hand the food to the cashier. I have no idea if it's because the place is so new and everyone is in training, but I thought it was a bit overwhelming. There was a also a \"touch screen & recharge\" station in the restaurant for you to charge your electronic devices and such. Not sure if that fit in with the whole image of the restaurant, but I can see how it's functional for busy business people who want a quick lunch.  All in all, it was overwhelming but I'd go back. There were tons of choices, tons of people working, but tons of seating and the tables turned around quickly. Notably thought, there are only 2 bathroom stalls in the women's restroom. But $10 for a decent sized and tasty lunch isn't bad. I would definitely go back.",

Go to soup plantation or sweet tomato if that's what you want. You will spend a lot less and have a better salad. For what you get, the food wasn't cheap.   Also they will ask If you want something but they won't tell you it's an extra fee. I caught them doing that to everyone in my room and when I pointed out the fees before we paid no one caught on. So beware!  Overall I would not go back. I was unimpressed by the salad because the flavors were off and nothing seemed fresh. Most of the food seems prepackaged or filled with preservatives.   I can't presume that the food here is unhealthy but in no way would I consider it a place where I would go if I were being health conscious. It really seems full of preservatives and not very fresh.  Salad places should be full of raw food options that are fresh and unique in flavor.   My opinion... Go to presto instead. Make the drive to rainbow and tropicana! P.S. I'm not affiliated with Presto I was just super impressed by the food!   Sadly very disappointed in this place.",

    "text": "For a soup, salad, sandwich place, they have a nice concept.  If you're picky like me, they will accommodate your tastes, if you ask. I ordered Cobb salad w/ turkey and veggie quinoa soup.  I subtracted the ugly looking bacon, pre-cooked in the line, with other items - more turkey and sliced almonds for example. Also, I wanted more veggie than broth in my soup.  It was easily done.  The associate bent over backwards to help.  The place is reasonably clean, given the volume they do at this location. It will probably increase significantly given the amount of new home construction in this area.  For this genre of restaurant, I recommend to anyone wanting a light, somewhat healthy lunch.  I would give 5 stars with the exception of too many salads have a default sugar added -- really!!  Nonetheless, any item can be modified to your tastes.  All of this food for less than $10 bucks.  Happy fooding!",

    "text": "Fits an awesome niche that I'd like to see more of: quick food that's super healthy and flavorful.  I got the combo pick 2 between ( Whole sandwich, soup, salad).  + you get a free chocolate dipped strawberry and bread roll. The strawberry just such a nice touch.  I got the tomato basil which was tasty, but a little sweet for my preferences. I like more of a strong acidic tomato flavor, but if you like more gentle tomato soup go for it.  Got the Chinese chicken salad which was very tasty and fresh. I liked that they didn't slather the thing in dressing, which is one killer when it comes to calorie control. A salad can still be 1000 calories if you use gobs of creamy dressing, bacon, cheese, tons of nuts, etc. but this salad you could see that it was pretty lean and tasty.  Turkey avocado sandwich was delicious. That's all I can say since if you've had one before, you probably now what this tastes like.  This reminds me of the healthy, marathon running healthier sister to Panera bread or corner bakery (which I do love but easy to overdo on calories). Cafe Zupas had a great concept and executed it well.",

Not only was it food poisoning, I had a severe allergic reaction to my sandwich I'm normally okay eating. Which led me to think it could've been cross contaminated. I remember when I used to work at this very location we almost got shut down from the health inspector!! And often times some of the sandwich mixes would fall into others. Same with ingredients. Looks like not much has changed and that was over 3 years ago. Again, I'm not complaining just informing. I hope management and others see this and fix any issues to prevent others from getting sick like I did! I love this restaurant but you won't be seeing me anytime soon after how sick you guys made me.",

Bothered at this point so I ask to speak with the manager. Manager sits down at my table & is pleasant but left me feeling like she was more concerned about her employee who was rude than my salad (which is fine). They remade my salad but at this point my appetite was gone. Offered zero compensation like my money back or vouchers for future visits. Left disappointed, especially because this *used* to be my spot to eat 3-4 times a week.",

Especially when I saw the amount they put in the to-go container. It was not even full and according to my sis when someone once asked why they aren't filled to the brim, it's apparently because they only use one ladle. So already I was a bit disgusted with this place.   So I got the half soup/ half salad but my sister took the salad, so sorry no pic on that. The 2 combo comes with a roll and a chocolate covered strawberry.   The bread is perfect. Not too hard, not too soft. Perfectly sweet and hearty. As for the soup, awesome! Filled with roasted corn, celery, carrots, and a cream filled broth that's full of butter (I know, unhealthy but whatever). It's worth it. Every last bit. And who in their right mind wouldn't love a chocolate covered strawberry at the end of a meal?   Definitely coming back to try more combos of soups, salads and sandwiches.",

But this new shift lead was terrible, we seemed to be interrupting everyone from doing closing duties at 8:25 (when they close at 9:00). I understand getting some things prepped for closing but they seemed like we were an interruption. We ordered Nuts n Berries salad and Pesto Chicken combo, Pesto Chicken sandwich and large Cauliflower soup, and Thai Steak salad and steak and cheese sandwich. They got the salad made but the guy who came to grab the cutting prep boards with dirty hands grabbed our salad and moved it off the board and went to set it down, but spilled it all over the place, he picked up our dressing container and tried to fix it to put it back in our salad. I coughed so he would see me watching him. Another team member stopped him and told him to get out of there. They tried to give us our salad and I had to ask for another dressing on our salad after they rearranged and tried to salvage what they could of our salad. They also forgot our 3rd sandwich which I had to ask for. My wife saw how angry this was making me and she left the store because she was disgusted. We got our food home and we found they gave us a chicken pesto sandwich instead of the steak and cheese, and they forgot the strawberries and the quality of the lettuce was disgusting. Never go in there after 8:00 pm when they are trying to close early.",

The food wasn't the problem though. When I got to the counter to pay, the young man assisting with the orders placed our two sandwiches, the bowl of soup, and a salad onto the tray. When I told him that we hadn't ordered a salad he said that we had and informed me that my wife ordered it. I looked at the salad and told him there's no way my wife would have ever ordered a salad like that. He didn't believe me and left to go find her and ask her directly.   When the young man got back from finding my wife, who informed him that she in fact did not order a salad, there was no apology and no explanation. My order was rung up, I was given my food, and he just walked away. This ranks among the most bizarre experiences I have ever had in a restaurant of any size.

So now every time I stop in there I have to watch them like a hawk and ask them to fill until it's almost to the top.  My husband stopped to get soup for us today and I forgot to tell him, and when he came home he had a small chicken tortilla and it was only halfway full.  He got charged full price. This is a big problem with this establishment. It's not what I would consider cheap food and yet they skimp anywhere they can. Tomato basil with orzo means you get about five pieces of orzo with your soup. Very unhappy with today's order.",

It was our first time to Cafe Zupas so wasn't sure the set up/ordering system.  As soon as you walk in, there is a sign that tells you how to order.  Step 1 decide what you want, step 2 if you order soup, you order at the soup station, step 3 pay and enjoy!  I decided on the combo of soup and salad and opted for the protein cobb with the red pepper lobster bisque soup.  Salad's are made in front of you with your choice of dressing and soup is ordered at the soup station which are ladled in your bowl in front of you also.  By the time you get your salad and/or soup, your sandwich would be ready also (if you ordered one).  With 2 pick choose 2 combos and 2 drinks, total came out to about $20.  The fountain drink station has an Italian syrup station so you can customize your drinks and they serve Gingerale as one of your drink options!  I enjoyed my soup and salad but can  see why people say the portions are a little on the smaller side.  Luckily I wasn't too hungry but I'm thinking the portions are not huge since there's a lot of ingredients in the salad, either way enjoyed the meal would definitely come back.  *The bread and chocolate covered strawberry was a nice surprise too!",

He works out of this location on Eastern Ave. It never ceases to amaze me, that the restaurants in Las Vegas think that they can act and treat their customers terrible and they will keep their jobs and the business will continue, to keep its doors open. I leave this review in hopes, that is NOT THE CASE! I called the restaurant to place a to go order for pickup. I had send someone to the restaurant to pick it up, but when they arrived, no one had a clue what was going on??? I said, put me on the phone with them. After going around with 2 gals on the phone and one manager, Drew, trying to get my order for a soup and salad ready, for about 10 minutes, I said, I'm not paying for this order, you guys screwed this up, this is ridiculous! He says, \"Well, we can't give you free food!\" Number one, the order was called in, you dropped the ball! Number two, then I had to talk to 3 different employees, the gal got the soup wrong (fixed it, the size AND the kind, were both wrong!), while the manager ran around and LITERALLY THREW, my salad together!! Ridiculous behavior when they are charging $19.00, for these two items!!! You can have Great Food all day long, but if you have HORRIBLE SERVICE, and employees that are VERY RUDE, guess what, PEOPLE WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Just like I will next time!! There's a million places to eat in Las Vegas!! Bye Bye Zupas:( I hope Corporate is happy with your behavior, because they are on my to do list for tomorrow!",

Then, because I have a large order, I get asked to repeat it five more times. This is normal and I have been dealing with it, having a large family. What angers me is that this is the 4th time I've had absolutely horrendous service. We were at the Lake Mead location in Vegas and Kacee and Shawnee, who are supposed to represent some type of poor excuse for management, have absolutely no customer service skills when things are messed up on their part. In addition, they ran out of their famous chocolate covered strawberries and I asked if they could be replaced with a small amount of the fruit they did have (grapes and canned mandarin oranges, which are significantly cheaper than strawberries anyway and I would've been happy even with anything) for my children. I was told no and there was nothing they can do. I asked them if there was anything else they could replace the bread with (as my kids can't eat it) and they just kept saying no, that's their store policy. After a frustrating and very pointless conversation with them, my husband asked for a refund for his food. They gave us his $8 refund and threw his salad in the trash. So... to sum up this experience, the employees at this establishment would rather throw away money than make their customers happy. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant again because I'm so tired of getting treated like crap while they take my money. Never again. Go to Panera!",

I had never heard of it and she said she was disappointed that she couldn't go there in Los Angeles.  So when I found myself in the parking lot, I was going to go to Taco Y Taco. However I went inside and it was super crowded and very loud, so loud with all the concrete and metal that I decided to walk out and go to Cafe Zupas instead.   That was a great decision! I walked in and was greeted by a friendly staff member who told me about the buy two for $7.99 special, and that's what I decided on.  I got the Thai salad and the lobster bisque.  Both were very good. I'm not sure the lobster bisque had any lobster in it but it sure had carrots. However the flavor was very good and it was creamy and delicious. I can't believe I was eating soup when I was in the 90s outside but it was oddly refreshing.  The Thai salad was tasty, the chopped peanuts were a nice touch, the steak was good but the pieces were very small maybe they do that so it's not a choking hazard. They give you plastic utensils and it would be hard to cut steak with them. But I found it just a little bit lacking. The flavor was fine but it was nothing special.   I look forward to going back here and trying some other things. I want to take my wife, because she loves a good salad and sandwich. The sandwiches looked amazing! I'm trying not to eat too many carbs so I didn't have one.",

I used to be a regular at the Stephanie location, but have migrated over to this location.  The food is good and has a lot more healthy options than much of their neighbors. I'm a salad gal, so that's what I normally order. I've tried the Strawberry Harvest, Garden Chicken Chop, California Protein Cobb, and BBQ Chicken. All delicious, but my favorite is the Cobb with herb vinaigrette. There are a variety of soups and sandwiches to choose from as well and ordering is cafeteria style. They also have creme brulee made in store, which is not really a creme brulee because the top is not brulee'd lol it's more like a pudding cup, but still delicious. There are other desserts if you're feeling naughty. I really like their cheesecakes and million dollar bar.  Honestly, their customer service could use a little work. Sometimes people are very outgoing and nice, but other times, people are not responsive. The line can get confusing and it gets a little annoying being asked what you ordered by each person down the line. Maybe they should switch to putting names on orders instead.  Good, fresh, quality, mostly healthy food keeps me coming back here. Some of the best salads I've ever had. Happy customer here.",

    "text": "On the first rainy, chilly day I experienced in Vegas I needed a nice soup to warm up this ex-Floridian. Stopped into Cafe Zupas for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. Walking in, the establishment is clean, bustling for lunch, and displays many options.  I didn't have much time to think as service is so quick (that's a good thing!) so I ordered a half soup and sandwich combo. I went for the mushroom bisque and the Cuban sandwich. Both were good, I definitely enjoyed the sandwich however the soup was missing something. I asked for croutons just before checking out and I'm glad I did because without that salty crunchy component, the soup felt like it was missing something. The broth didn't seem as fluffy/creamy (if that even makes sense) as other bisque style soups typically are. However the flavor was still decent and the mushrooms were a great texture component.   The Cuban sandwich is definitely not a REAL Cuban sandwich LOL for all my Cubans out there or fellow Miami natives. BUT, it was delicious. I typically don't like pickles but they were so good with this sandwich. The pork was hearty and the red peppers gave it a nice seasoned taste.   The meal came with a dinner roll which I assume is for the soup and a chocolate covered strawberry. I didn't have more than a bite of the roll because I had enough bread with the sandwich but I can imagine for the soup/salad combos, it's much more satisfying. The strawberry was a perfect little ending to a hearty lunch.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying their other soups and sandwiches as honestly ALL of their options sound appetizing. And definitely going to try one of those dessert bars. They sound DELICIOUS.",

I believe was the manager. I don't think made any eye contact. Didn't apologize for the employees telling me wrong info. Plus she had no personality.  Salad wasn't very good.

Took it back up to the counter and asked to get a bowl with chicken enchilada chili with chicken. The clerk went over to the salad bar and grabbed a scoop of cold chicken and threw it into my bowl of soup. I tried it and it was disgusting as the chicken was still cold because it came from the salad bar. Since I did not eat the chicken enchilada chili soup, I decided to try the lobster bisque which was even more disgusting with imitation crab meat and chopped up tomatoes the soup was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdisgusting.it&s=b0e2baff0d2758538b711ef041d5f7bd72b39bdd557b6cb67da945d0ee7ba8e2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">disgusting.it</a> felt like the chef ran out of lobster and threw in tiny chopped up tomatoes so it would look like lobster. They also don't have crackers also which is sad because most people like crackers with their soup.   I also got the chicken pesto sandwich which hardly had any chicken. It was all bread and another huge disappointment. I went up to the counter and mentioned it to the manager who looked at me like I was crazy. She said \"I'm sorry\" and that was it. This used to be a very good soup but I believe the quality of all of zupas food has gone downhill dramatically. The prices have also gotten ridiculous. I won't be going back there for their advertised chicken items that have no chicken in them and their crab soup thats full of tomatoes and no crab.",

I'd like to say I go here at least almost once a week. if you can't make up your mind between a salad, soup or sandwich - there's a combo option for only $9, which the portions are perfect and fulfilling for the price. they also let you sample the soups which I should have done from the start but didn't until my 2nd visit.  the pesto chicken panini is great. if you're into sauces like I am, definitely get a side of honey mustard to dip that bad boy in it.   next time around, I did the combo and went with the chicken chipotle glaze salad with the chicken tortilla soup. I'm officially addicted to the salad and get it every time I go there. I love the combination of spicy and sweet dressing on it. I also asked for extra onions which they wanted to charge extra for. normally I can see them charging extra for a meat/protein or even guacamole but for a veggie like onions? alrighty then. what threw me off was when the one employee met me by the register and had this disconcerting look on her face. she said there's olives in my salad, which it normally doesn't come with. she didn't apologize but instead asked if I wanted a different one.. I just went with what I already had cause she was making me uncomfortable.   a few times, when I got to the register they always ask what I ordered and other times they already know. I feel like they should probably get that down a little better. sometimes the staff is really nice, and other times they're stale. customer service needs to be consistent.  as far as the soups go, do what I mentioned earlier and try before you buy. a couple times the tortilla has been overly salty. I changed it up and went with the roasted veggie quinoa which was delicious.   less salt, more friendliness.",

I say mostly, because there are various deserts and meals that are slightly less desirable for your overall health, but you could do a lot worse. The vegetables are always fresh, and I haven't had a soup I didn't enjoy. Mushroom bisque is my favorite.  The staff is always super friendly, although borderline annoyingly so. You know what they're going to say after going there 3+ times. I think they are all on a script. And besides that, the prices are on that edge of affordably uncomfortable to asking a little to much. But if you don't mind dropping the extra scratch it's a good place to eat.   Also, don't worry about the food trays. They pick up after you. (I always hate leaving the table a mess, so this befuddled me).",

They have a menu board for you to look at but they also have paper menus available that include a bit more item details.  I usually get a 2 item combo of soup & sandwich, sandwich & salad or soup & salad. For the soup I recently tried the tomato basil with orzo pasta. The soup was just the right temperature & tasted great! The crab avocado sandwich deserves a mention! Nice chunks of crab with avocado and a smokey cheese. Man was that good, I'm still drooling over it. The final yumminess from here is the chocolate covered strawberry! What a great way to finish a meal!  Service is always fast! They tend to get busy over lunch hour but the table turnover is quick so you don't need to have someone save you a table.  Fresh food, friendly service and a nice atmosphere ensures that I will be back again!",

The order was called in by my wife who ordered 4 Try 2 Combo's and 2 California Turkey Sandwiches.   Instead, I received 4 Try 2 Combo's and 1 Sandwich. This left one person without food for dinner when I arrived home.  I called over and verified my order was called into \"Jordan.\" Christian, who stated he was a manager, offered for me to come in to pick up a free sandwich. Your advertisement is that you can deliver. I expected it would be the least that could be done considering I'm expecting guests any minute. Christian stated he couldn't do that--all the drivers \"had gone home for the day.\"   What was supposed to be a pleasant evening with family left us wanting. This was a very disappointing experience.",

On a recent trip when ordering a sandwich, I had asked for them to leave some of the items off (which mind you they weren't going to charge me less for) and asked to add bacon. They young lady working then told me that they can't add anything to their sandwiches, that \"it's a new corporate policy.\" Mind you this is the sandwich that I'm paying for. So I asked for a side of bacon instead, to which she said she wouldn't provide that either, that if anything she could maybe charge me for some of the bacon bits used for the salad. I asked to speak to a manager, which she said she was, with an attitude. I decided to leave since I dont like paying for food that I won't enjoy, and as I left some other employee walked over to the girl helping us, presumably to ask why we were leaving, to which they both giggled. Someone should remind their corporate that they don't pay me to eat their food, and thanks to their employee and 'manager' I won't be back.",

    "text": "I tried it for the first time last week on the recommendation of a co-worker! I loved it! I got a salad and sandwich combo...a spinach artichoke sandwich and a berry salad. They were very good. Complimentary roll and chocolate dipped strawberry was a nice touch. It was packed and noisy because it was lunch hour, but I had no trouble finding a place to sit. The way the tables are arranged are a little awkward and close together, but it was no big deal. I love the drink area with the spritzer bar and you can't go wrong with a re-charge station with touch screens! Though I'm not sure I want to touch public screens while eating. The staff was really nice and the guy at the cashier joked with me a bit. They seemed to be prepared for the crowd and kept the line going pretty smoothly. Also, having the paper menus in the line made ordering go quicker.",

I always wait way too long because there is one or two people trying to slam out a long line of waiting customers. They are always unorganized, always flustered, someone is always yelling for someone else to help, and I always have to ASK for my receipt. THIS DISGUSTS ME THE MOST AND I HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN TWICE NOW. Teach your staff to TAKE OFF THEIR GLOVES before handling money!!!!! This was the second time I saw an employee use their salad making gloves to receive form of payment and give change as well. Then going right back to touching food with the same gloves. I saw one 'female manager looking women' today throw her glove away twice while I waited, but not the younger team member. They seem to be so flustered needed someone's help that their attention goes to getting help instead of proper health awareness. You should have a food maker, a soup and extras maker, and the cashier should only be there for the payment transactions! Hellooooo! Don't think I'm going to come back again because every time I leave I end up frustrated... Again.",

You have to wait in line for your food and seat yourself. This didn't bother me at all, for me it works because I have small children. It's noisy so if my kids scream, like they always do.. no one will mind.  We ordered the crab and avocado  sandwich and it was so good! Lots of crab and avocado, while I'm not crazy about warm avocado it was fine. Mango berry salad was the thing I was most excited about trying and it was just okay. I thought I ordered a large but I guess they gave me a half and forgot to put any almonds on it. Hardly no dressing but from what I could taste the dressing was good. Next time I'm skipping this. The best thing we had was the Lobster Bisque. It was a huge portion for $6! It had actual lobster pieces in it and other vegetables and a great flavor.   I would come back to try other things. It's very cheap and for the quality of the food it's great!",

They offer a great variety of salads, soups and sandwiches. Order in large or half orders OR try their 2 combo for only $8.79 and pick any two of your choice. The meal also comes with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The portion is just enough to fill you up. Don't be shy to ask for extra or other ingredients (for a little extra cost of course). The process is like a cafeteria style where you order what you like and as you go down the line, you can add soup and there's also a sweets/dessert case with assorted creme brulee, cakes and bars. There are a plenty of staff so you get super quick service and wait time is never a problem. I always get to-go during lunch time and I'm never there longer than 5 minutes. Everyone is super friendly and patient to help you with any questions. All their ingredients are fresh and everything is made from scratch each day. Their cleanliness is also a plus.   I'm addicted to their Strawberry Harvest Salad! I've never been a salad girl but after trying this, I'm HOOKED. It's more of a sweet salad though which I don't mind. It has sliced chicken breast, strawberries, dried cranberries, sliced apples, pecans, and fontina cheese along with their unique Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette. Everything complements each other so well it's amazing how great a salad can taste. I like to add oranges to it as well. I have to eat this at least once a week on my lunch break. I always tell myself to try something new on the menu but I can't seem to drift away from my Strawberry Harvest!",

My favorites are the glazed chicken chipotle salad, the asparagus soup (that they brought out for a limited time in the spring), and the herbed chicken bacon avocado sandwich (although I ask for it to be made into a panini).   They give you a complimentary slice of french baguette and a chocolate covered strawberry (which is obviously the real reason why anyone goes to Zupas. complimentary chocolate covered strawberry, I'm there!). Which is why I was a little bit bummed out the last time I went on Friday August 14th, they were out of fudge and could only gave you a regular strawberry (which is still great, but it's not what I had grown to expect from one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants)!  Also, if you go near closing time, whenever they have any extra desserts you can get them for half off! Which is amazing, because the desserts are well worth it at full price!",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas, is a nice little casual lunch or dinner spot. I've only eaten here once, because I wasn't a huge fan.  I didn't like the limited selection of salad fix-ins or the pre-determined salad choices they created.  However, if you can't make up your mind between a salad, soup or sandwich - there's a combo option for only $9, which the portions are good and fulfilling for the price.  However, I strong suggest Sweet Tomatoes/ Soup Plantation as the best option.  But, if you don't have either of these locations as on option then Cafe Zupas is it.     Now, Cafe Zupas does let you sample the soups, which is a nice option as well.",

    "text": "Feeling the onsets of a cold, my boyfriend and I decided to give Zupas a shot with the hope of a good soup & salad to feel better. From the moment we walked into the door, we knew we made the right decision choosing here!  We were greeted immediately by a girl who welcomed us to our first visit and explained how the ordering process works. The collections of homemade soups , the variety of subs, and fresh ingredients for the salads made choosing which combos to go with more difficult - you can choose two out of the three and it comes with a slice of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry.   I went with the lobster bisque and the bbq chicken salad. Although the name of the salad sounds too \"rich\", the salad was surprisingly refreshing and perfect. The soup was flavorful, but lukewarm. My boyfriend got the avocado turkey club and the new England clam chowder. He devoured every bite, so I'm guessing he enjoyed his meal also. We only spent $20 for two combos, chips, and two soft drinks -- what a deal!  I would describe zupas as a nice alternative to the bland flavors that are delivered at panera bread. It feels like a healthier choice also. I can't compliment the atmosphere enough -- they have a charging station where you can plug your chargers for any of your electronics, an array of hot sauces as well as flavor pumps for your drinks, and digital menus and displays around the dining room.   Despite the fact that this place is kinda a fast-food soup/salad joint, the staff makes you feel like you just entered a fine-dining establishment with their attentiveness.   We will definitely be back! :)",

And this is consistent with all the Cafe Zupas in town, where I feel that when I am placing my order and go down the line to the register, I feel that I am placing and repeating my order 3 different times.  Whether I am placing an order for just myself, or ordering for a few people at the office, it's the same thing.  Even if I order salads from the first person, the soup person asks if I ordered anything else. Then there is a person at the dessert station who asks you if you would like dessert, then asks you what you ordered.  Then when you get to the register, the register person asks you what you ordered.  Heaven forbid you order a sandwich!  If you don't tell the register person you ordered a sandwich before you pay, you aren't getting your sandwich!  I think one person in the beginning needs to write all of it down, then pass your order along to all the people involved, then have your order ready once you get to the register.  Or better yet, have online ordering available and let customers be responsible for placing their own orders.  Other than this critique, the food here is great!!!",

From placing my order to paying for my meal, they were all professional, courteous and smiling!  Great customer service!  Now ~ they have many many items to choose from.   Ultimately decided on the Turkey Cranberry Gourmet Sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.   This is part of the pick 2 for $7.99.   Nice!  I was used to the Panera pick 2 when it only comes with 1/2 sandwich but here it is the whole sandwich!  Fantastic!   The Turkey Cranberry is served on a ciabatta bread roll with sprouts, cucumber, cheese, mixed greens and house made honey mustard.  This was a fabulous combination of ingredients that my taste buds sure did enjoy! The great thing about their ciabatta bread is it was soft and not flaky.  Sometimes that type of bread can be really tough to chew but they have theirs figured out.    Now for the soup.  Some people might cringe at the fact of eating cauliflower. The Wisconsin Cauliflower soup was really great! It has a flavor and texture of potato cheese soup! I see more and more recipes using cauliflower instead of potatoes.  Cuts calories and healthier (I think or that's what I'm telling myself).  My opinion is the soup was great and give it a try!  BONUS BONUS BONUS~~~ Their sandwiches come with a chocolate covered strawberry! The strawberry was fresh and the chocolate had a great non-bitter flavor!   I am thrilled about Cafe Zupas! A great place!",

So I decided to go tonight :) I had the 2 combo meal with lobster bisque and the avocado crab sandwich. I loved the soup and the roll they give you that was on point. But the sandwich was little off... I think next time I'll ask for the avocado on the side and spice it up at home lol. It was bland, so it kind of ruined the sandwich . I guarantee if I didn't have the avocado on the sandwich, would've tasted way better. It's really good crab meat, just that avocado... I will definitely go back and try a new sandwich",

    "text": "I first discovered this place about a year and a half ago on the way back home, and ran in thinking it was a quick sub shop like firehouse or something.  Cafe Zupas is actually completely different, you start by picking a soup, salad, then sandwich if you want a combo. You can order the half sized soup or salad (4.39) depending on your appetite or a whole size. Usually a half will fill me up plenty (and I usually have a large appetite).  To do's: I would recommend the lobster bisque and tomato basil for the soup. Both are rich and creamy, and the tomato basil comes off with a slight sweet but good balanced taste. It also comes with 2 rolls, and for every item you get ie. A soup, a salad, or a sandwich; you get a free chocolate covered strawberry.  To don'ts: I would keep away from the clam chowder, although it isn't horrible, it has a strange cheesy flavor. Similar to parmesan, but it just comes off as a little awkward and rich tasting in a chowder; it just didn't belong.  Must try: the chicken pesto panini. The outer crust is a little hard and crisp, but the fillings taste great and the alfalfa sprouts in the panini don't over power any of the flavor.  Sure why not: the crab salad panini was mediocre, and had a little bit of a tuna melt taste to me. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like that kind of rich flavor and soft texture, then I say go for it.  On days where I'm driving by, I'd recommend coming here for a quick lunch, it's definitely a good spot to just grab a bite on break from work.",

    "text": "My first time to a Cafe Zupas.  During lunch time, expect a crazy busy establishment. Upon just parking, you can already see the lines through their windows.  But one thing you have to keep in mind...it's new, it's lunch time, and it's located off Eastern Ave.  So many restaurants off Eastern Ave is super packed during lunch time.  Zupas was no different.  After finally getting parked, you walk in.  The line is organized somewhat like what you see at Disneyland (minus the fast pass).  However, the line for ordering does go pretty quick.  Your food is built in an assembly like fashion starting with your salads, sandwiches, soup, and finally desserts. The place is packed and the other concern is whether or not you will even have a seat.  Go ahead and try to save a table.  Can't do it, it's not allowed.  They even have signs posting that you cannot save a table.  This wasn't a problem since there's was at least 3 tables opened when we ate. But I'm sure there are days where seating in limited.   As for their food, I got their Turkey Spinach Artichoke Panini with their Lobster Bisque.  The soup portions are huge and the food portions are just okay.  My sandwich wasn't bad, actually was pretty good.  It's the soup that I rave about.  The the price and taste of their lobster bisque rivals other sitdown, more expensive restaurants.  Just wish there was thick pieces of lobster in there.  My total order came up to about $10 which included the sandwich, soup, drink, a strawberry, and a lunch roll.    Prices are about average for the rest of the menu, but they do have a lunch special for $7.99.  This includes sandwich and half soup.  By the way, if you have a sweet tooth, then you have to try their desserts. I'm not saying it's good, because for one, I don't have a sweet tooth. And two, I didn't have any.  The presentation looks good. I guess I will just have to wait for someone else's review to see how good the sweets truly are. One of my issues with this place...so many damn calories in almost everything here.  I know there is because myfitnesspal told me. Overall, I am giving this place 4 stars just because I will probably be back and so far, I'm a fan.  PS:  I still think Beach Hut Deli, which is located in the same parking lot, is better.

    "text": "This is now my favorite sandwhich place!!!! So many choices with fresh ingredients.   Here's how it works: be prepared to wait in line if you come during peak eating times. It's $7.99 for your choice of two items (sandwhich, soup or salad). Its kind of like a subway line where you can see everything made in front of you. You order your sandwhich or salad with the first person in the line. And you just move down the line. And you order your soup from the people standing in front of the soups. There are add ins to the soup like bacon, cheese or croutons for an additional charge. By the time you get to the cashier, your entire order is ready. They also have syrups to add flavor to your drinks.   My absolute favorites are the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich with clam chowder. The sandwhiches are huge and packed with flavor. And the clam chowder is thick and chunky. The blueberry maple salad was a refreshing alternative to clam chowder on a hot day. The dressing they used was light and added to the fresh blueberries and maple chunks in the salad.   I look forward to trying everything on the menu!!!",

So far I've tried the Red Pepper and Lobster soup and the Yucatan Chipotle Chicken salad. Both were very good, so good in fact that I went back the next day for another salad. It was way too hot out for soup. I don't think the salad needs any additional add ons... but I really liked the cheesy bread add on for the soup. Although next time I have it I wont let it sit in the soup so long... it tasted better before it got soggy.    My only complaint is they have these little signs on the tables politely asking people to eat and go. I feel like it's a little rude. I don't like feeling rushed out the door.",

    "text": "Cafe Zupas' debut into the Vegas Valley from its SLC roots finally happened this week!  They are also opening a Summerlin location soon.  The space is on the north edge of the shopping center at Richmar and Eastern, on the same side as Red Mango and Popped, next to Republic.  They are known for Soups, Salads, and Sandwiches, with soups scratch made daily and a window into the kitchen.  Today the place was packed with ladies lunching and lots of happy children.  The space is very bright and there were staff welcoming us every step of the way.  I had lunch here with Randal R.  We both did the you pick 2 combo, which is a choice of 2 from: whole sandwich, half salad, soup.  He got the Asian BBQ pork sandwich and I am not sure what else.  I got the Thai mango chicken salad and the Yucatan Chicken Soup.    The salad ingredients are FRESH and separated and it is assembled in front of you.  A chorus of \"Thai Mango\" from each person down the line greeted me.  I did not pay enough attention to the menu until later so you can create your own salad, which will be fun for next time.  There are many salad creations, soups, and sandwiches suggested though.  I was also able to sample soups before picking one.  The Yucatan chicken soup was flavorful but a tad too salty.  I still got it because it came with free optional toppings: GUACAMOLE, lime, and tortilla strips.  Free guac?  Yes please!  The salad was DEEEElicious.  Fresh mango, thin grilled chicken (cold), crisp lettuce, wonton strips, light drizzle of peanut dressing...I definitely would order it again.  I also got passionfruit-mango iced tea - there is a cute \"Italian soda syrup bar\" with recipes to help patrons create flavors with the soda fountain.  Also, there is a hot sauce collection (Blair's Death, Dave's Insanity, etc.) so that is a nice touch.  Overall, friendly staff, fresh made food, lots of options, and very affordable.  Every order got a small piece of fresh baked bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry!!!  Combo is $7.99, takes credit cards.",

    "text": "I went from not knowing that Cafe Zupas even existed to becoming a huge fan in one visit. ,. When you walk in, you'll see their bright, aesthetically pleasing menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches. There are also desserts available near the register. I would skip the salads because they tend not to carry as much savory flavor.  My favorite sandwich is easily the Italian Club, which apparently has a sauce made of some sort of really addictive chemical. It was love at first bite. The Asian BBQ Pork was also good. I like to pair a sandwich in a $7.99 Try Two combo with a half soup of some sort. So far, all of the soups that I have tried are excellent: Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, Mushroom Bisque (vegetarian), Lobster Bisque, and New England Clam Chowder. They are served with a complimentary piece of bread, and there are several options for mix-ins that I haven't tried yet but could be nice if you're into that kind of thing.  I've tried a friend's cheesecake, which was really delicious, but more conservative eaters will be satisfied for dessert with the complimentary chocolate-dipped strawberry. The fruit is so good on its own and you can taste it, and the chocolate just makes it better.  Finally, check out the recharge bar if you're alone or in a small group. You get bar-style seats on a counter, an interactive screen with drink mix ideas and other features, and most importantly, free recharging with the normal power outlets and USB outlets. You'll probably find me there if it's empty.  Cafe Zupas adds a very affordable, very delicious casual eating restaurant to the already extensive array of Eastern Ave. eateries. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't try it.",

The service and portions are better there!!! The gal taking out order was terribly rude here off Eastern... Her name is Micala.. And I guess she's apparently a manager... She kept barking at everyone to move down the line while she was preparing our salads... And taking ingredients out of the salad bowls as if she was giving too much??? The portions are pretty small for the price point to begin with!!! She was also rude when she was addressing her staff members of the sandwiches we were placing!!!  Hopefully someone that is anyone of authority will read this post and make some adjustments!!!  There are too many restaurants to choose from if you're not on salad kick...hopefully...there will be some changes!!!  By The way...the salads and sandwiches do taste great!!!!",

    "text": "Food is still very good, however, we've been having a lot of issues with order accuracy.   I always get my food to go. Once I got the kale quinoa salad to go, and when I opened my salad when I got home, there was no quinoa in my salad. I had to spend 30 min driving back to get some quinoa. How do you miss a main ingredient of the salad?! A week later, I got the kale quinoa salad to go again, and this time when I got home, I saw there was no dressing. So I had to spend another 30 minute of my life driving back to get the dressing.   They did offer me a free meal for my inconvenience. The process of getting that free meal is frustrating incident on its own. The manager that offered me a free meal only took down my name, even though I asked several times if there's a card or something I should take so it's more official. But he reassured me it will be fine as long as I give them my name. So when I went to go redeem it, nobody can find that piece of paper he scribbled my name on, and I had to repeat the incident to 3 different people before they got the manager on duty at the time, and I had to describe the whole incident to him again. It took almost 20 minutes before I was on my way with my free meal.   After those two incidents, I have decided I will never go to Zupas again, but my boyfriend is still a big fan so he's been getting takeouts for us. The first time he went, they actually forgot to put quinoa in his salad, but he caught it before he left the restaurant because my experiences have made him so paranoid. 30 min waste of his life averted. Yesterday he went to get a salad and guess what he found out when he got home (he forgot to check before he left...)..... Yep. No dressing! It's almost comical at this point but he was not amused and I had to pick up McDonald's for him (the McDonald's order was 100% accurate). We don't go to Zupas everyday so at this point their accuracy is less than 50%.   Please Zupas, you really need a better employee training program. And for all of you that are thinking of getting take out, make sure to check your orders before you leave!!!!",

I got the strawberry salad - they were out of the champagne dressing it usually comes with so I got the raspberry dressing instead (still tastes great, but I would like to go back to taste the original dressing). I also got the Italian sandwich, that wasn't anything special. All meals come with a piece of bread and a chocolate strawberry. Reminds me of an upgraded Panera Bread.",

    "text": "I have been here several times, both for lunch and for dinner. We came in today for an informal low carb lunch. There were lots of options at very reasonable prices. You line up cafeteria style and order your meal in sequence. I wanted a salad. The first person took out a large bowl and placed the lettuce. The next person in line added in the extras that are specific to my salad. For my Cobb salad, she threw in the chicken, olives, eggs, bacon, etc. As you go down the line they ask if you want a sandwich or soup. The next person asks if you want one of the desserts. After that you come to the cash register. I have been very impressed with how pleasant and helpful the staff is. Going from the person who opens the door and greets you with a smile to the the workers behind the counter who prepare the food, everyone seems to be smiling and happy. In my Cobb salad today the ingredients for all fresh. They could put in a little more chicken, but that is a minor gripe. Overall, it was a delicious  freshly made-to-order salad, more than enough food for lunch. They threw in a chocolate covered strawberry and a piece of bread. Nice touch! All of that for under $10. Tasty and a good deal too!",

    "text": "As soon as you walk into the door, all of the workers greet you - which is something that should happen more often at other places. The menu there is a lot bigger than I had expected so look at it before you get in line and don't be one of those people who stare at the menu for 20 minutes going \"uhhhh\" while holding up the line! The set up in there is cafeteria style where you just walk down, tell them what you want while they make it, and pay at the end. The place overall is very clean and pretty organized. I usually get to-go during my lunch break and never have to stay longer than 15 minutes to get my food. They offer a pretty large variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches so it can be sort of overwhelming. Good thing is that they offer their 2 combo for $8.79 which allows you to pick 2 things of your choice. There's also a dessert area where they have cars, bars, and creme brulee - I have yet to try them so I can't offer any input on those.  I usually go for the 2 Combo and get the  Strawberry Harvest Salad and whatever sandwich I feel like that day. After eating their strawberry harvest, I don't think I'll eat any other type of salad! It contains dried cranberries, chicken breast, candied pecans, sliced apples, fontina cheese, and a little container of their strawberry champagne vinaigrette - it can be a bit sweet so be careful when pouring it onto your salad!   The calories in the food can add up - so be cautious of that! Even though soups, salads, and sandwiches can seem healthy, there are a lot of hidden sugars and fats depending on what you order. But of course, this place is going to be a better choice than McDonalds!",

    "text": "Not happy with my experience today. Went in for my favorite \"Try Two\" Combo of Kale and Quinoa salad and Roasted Veggie and Quinoa soup. I love both of them! Right away I was informed the salad bar area was in repair so no salads were being served. Mine you this is lunchtime @ 11:30 am but hey stuff happens I know. So I switch over to soup and sandwich. The girl at the register doesn't ring my drink and I have to ask her to add it to my bill even though the drink cup is on my tray. Then I get to the table and there's no quinoa in my soup! I've had this soup several times. I go back to the counter and the manager said she'd get me a different bowl. The second bowl was the same! No one comes to my table to see if it is any better. I have to go back to the counter again. I had to ask twice before the manager spoke with me. She was busy texting  on her cell phone. Bottom line, she said the soup is the same recipe they always prepare. I asked her to show me a piece of quinoa then which she would not do. I had to ask for my money back for the soup I did not eat. She didn't offer it to me first, but she did give me $3 something back after I asked. I asked to speak with the chef and she said he wasn't there. She (Ashlyn) gave me the company <a href=\"mailto:info@cafezupas.com\">info@cafezupas.com</a> email to voice my complaint after I asked for the GM's phone number. There was no excuse for this poor service and food quality. They weren't even busy at the time. There were more people working there than eating there! So disappointed in the manager's attitude. She could have totally turned my experience around. That's what happens when you make 20 somethings a manager without properly training them on customer service.",

    "text": "What up y'all? The food at Cafe Zupas is great. The salads are fresh and dressings are tasty. The sandwiches are flavorful. The annoying thing that brings this review down to 2 stars is the annoying ordering process. You walk in and trying to read the menu and the salad Nazi is already asking what you want. Dude, I just walked in, give me a freaking minute. As I order a chicken chopped salad with blue cheese, I'm already attacked again by the sandwich guy. I haven't decided which sandwich yet because they have a lot of choices. I finally make my choice of the turkey and avocado. As I walk towards the register the soup bandit hounds me to buy soup. No, I already ordered the salad and sandwich and if they were paying attention would know that's all I wanted and then no, I wouldn't want any soup. As I get closer to the register, I can see the desserts. I love desserts. They are a weakness. That weakness is easily overcome by pushy counter people. Give me a damn min to look. Instantly I get turned off and just go right to the register. The best part is, now after getting hounded by 2 other people after you place your salad and sandwich order and feeling the pushy tactics of what should be a simple process, they ask you what did you order? REALLY??? I have to remember the name of what I ordered because the pushy sales of the counter people don't remember and or pass the information down to the register. Honestly, this is a joke and needs to be corrected. I love the food, it's just the service and way of ordering the food is such a pain in the ass that I will take my business elsewhere. Till next time........Let's Eat!!!",

I told the person working at the cash register. He told me, \"That's just the way it is\".  His attitude was indifference and he had no concern.         Although the salad tasted very good, I was still extremely hungry afterwards and it did nothing to satisfy my hunger.  Their portions was so small that it only teases your hungry appetite.  Zupas is not worth the money.  Their portions are way too small.  You will leave a big hungry angry bear.         In addition I emailed Zupas, they did not respond to my email.  This restaurant does not care about your concerns.  A simple response of concern would have been polite.",

You take your food, find a seat and eat up. I got a drink with my order and the total came to a little over $10. The food portion was very generous. My sandwich had a lot of pork and veggies.

    "text": "My first visit here, I came for lunch with friends and it was packed.  This place kind of reminded me of Panera Bread, but with more choices and a little bit cheaper.  They only took half my order because you order soup/ salad first then down the line you can order soup.  They got my sandwich order, but completely overlooked me and went to the person behind me,  I did manage to squeeze in my soup order (I was going for the pick 2).   My other friend was successful in placing both his orders, but his sandwich never came down to the cashier. Then they said they will bring it out to him and it took almost 15 minutes even when he went back to ask them what happen to his sandwich.  When it came to finding a table, the empty ones were dirty with no one in sight to clean or wipe off the table.  I had to go to the cashier to ask them to send someone or give me a towel to wipe it off.    I did enjoy my turkey spinach artichoke panini sandwich though.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed the soups. Hubby got the clam chowder and enjoyed it. I got the lobster bisque but I don't know if I would refer to it as a bisque but more of a chowder kinda of soup because of the carrots, celery, onion and fennel. We also got a side sandwich to go with the soup. It was the try 2 combo for $7.99.  You can choose between, soup, sandwich, or salad. Anyway I got the turkey bacon avocado and hubby got the honey bacon club.  Both were good but I felt the they were skimpy sandwiches. Overall  we will be returning.",

    "text": "We came here on opening day and it was packed. We came back a few months later and things were much more mellow. The food here is OK. The turkey on the TBA panini has the texture of packaged butterball turkey lunchmeat, not something that is \"fresh and homemade\" like they say. The salads here are above average but nothing special. The soups are what make this place desirable. The lobster bisque, even though I swear on opening day had large chunks of actual lobster, is sweet and tasty. The clam chowder is also very good. I love that they give you chocolate covered strawberries with every meal and their soda bar makes it worth a comeback visit. The prices here are also pretty good for what you get.",

I love love love the Turkey Bacon Avocado panini and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup is definitely my favorite! The atmosphere is fantastic and the food is great! We have a 3 month old and the greeters always offer to go get us a booster seat for his car seat. Really makes getting our food convenient!",
