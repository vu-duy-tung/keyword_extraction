    "text": "I came here for lunch after seeing the line for the Village Buffet being horrendously long. I was hungry and my friend was hungry.   We both ordered the Reuben and neither of us were disappointed at all. I got mine without cheese, he got it with. I absolutely inhaled mine because it had the perfect amount of salt and flavor. The potato salad I got with it was pretty tasty too!  Where this place REALLY lacked was the service. We sat there for 15 minutes listening to the same waiter telling us, \"Boys, you're next...\" and then he'd trail off as he walked away. The busboy came over and basically threw our drinks at us.   The prices were pretty outlandish, to be honest. An omelet was $11.99 and asking for egg-whites or the egg substitute was another $0.99 on top of that. Sure there were a mess of choices you could have, but you could only choose three before they charged you more. Even for Las Vegas, this was a little expensive.   The one time the server was fast was when I told him I wanted the bill - he brought that back in no time. Sure, it was a Saturday, but for the love of all things holy, there should be more people serving if it's that much of an issue.",

Initally very worried, since one of the coffee cups clearly had lipstick stains from a prior customer.   Inital cup of coffe wasn't hot.  Same with the refill canister left at our table.  Two dishes ordered were    (1)   FRENCH TOASTS.   You get 3 slices.  came with cane sugar syrup or house syrup specialty.   Though syrups very nice, dish is nothing to write home about.  (2)  Plate with 2 eggs,  french style potatoes,  thick sliced bacon,, and toast.   bacon & potatoes are worth trying.  total cost for two about $ 36 , before tip.  If you ask me,  stay with the coffee/pastry shops for breakfast.",

    "text": "Vegas, I think I'm done with you.  On my first visit, you were a bit obnoxious and fake for me.  However, upon further visits, you lured me in a bit.  Great deals on hotels, hundreds of dollars in blackjack winnings, and good food?  I was sold.  Last time you bared your teeth and took my blackjack money.  I started to see you for who you really are, not really wanting to continue the relationship.  This time was like visiting an ex.  I was in town, figured I'd introduce my friends to you even though I was mentally pretty much done with you.  This visit only clinched that for me.  I have zero love for Vegas anymore.  The strip is completely devoid of culture or anything I want to actually put money into.  The Paris hotel is a perfect example of that.  Ugh.  I always check Yelp before going somewhere out of town.  Why didn't I do that this time?  I was on a work trip to Vegas, staying out by the airport, and taking two first time Vegas-visiting employees down to the strip.  We were extremely tired and hungry, but on a budget.  Yes, we're on the company dime, and our company is on the frugal side.  Doesn't leave too many options for dinner on the strip.  We went into this place which, as others have mentioned, is like a French Denny's.  The menu was pretty darn expensive, too, for being the \"diner\" version of the Paris restaurants.  I saw similar prices on the menu at Paris's more upscale \"Mon Ami Gabi\".  We all opted for the $12.99 beef tenderloin with crab and asparagus topping, vegetables, and potatoes.  The crab topping was neither crab nor K-rab.  Not sure what it was, except for white and stringy.  The steak was kind of bland but at least edible.  I only had to spit one chewy piece into my napkin.  I think at $12.99, it was one of the cheapest things on the menu.  We had to ask for the bread, which was nothing special.  I had to eat some butter to make the meal taste better, though.  If you want cheap steak, go for the $10.99 steak and lobster in the basement at Binion's.  The atmosphere is similarly Denny's-like, and the food only slightly better, but at least you get some lobster and a salad.  As for me, I think I'm done with Vegas.  Blech blech blech.",

Came here for dinner the first night because it was convenient, as in out the room, straight down and across the elevators.  Service was extremely slow...I said we were ready to order to the man who brought us water, and he said we had to wait for our server, who showed up a while later. Also had to ask for bread as it didn't arrive and we were starving. It was biscuit (buttery, pretty good) and standard white. At one point, a roll from a basket ready to be delivered to another table fell off the tray and rolled past us...with much ado. It was still there when we left.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with roasted garlic, olives, tomatoes, potatoes and crispy cheesebread. No greens to a 'salad', but it was tasty. Friend ordered a steak which he finished.   We actually ended up there at 1 am the morning of the day we left. Got a fruit plate which had raspberries, mini blueberries, sliced pineapple, thin watermelon, grapes, and halved strawberries. The teapot had a hole in it so the hot water poured on the table as it also filled our cups. The best thing about the plate was the banana nut bread.",

We wanted, well, food!   We ended up skimming the menu which had a good variety of food. Steak, Prime Rib, Breakfast options, Soups, Salads etc... The only thing that seemed veggie friendly was the Pasta. My friend asked if they had (off menu) a vegetarian sandwich of some sort. Low & behold, we were informed that they did. A veggie-sandwich which comprised of eggplant, mushrooms, bell peppers and more. Sided with either fries or a baked potato. Wow! Sounded tasty. When our dish came out, it looked fabulous. Yes, it was exactly how it was described to us but it was hard to control since all the actual vegetables were flying out of my breaded envelope. I couldn't control these suckers. I ended up forking the vegetables and swooshing my bread to the side. Had it swooped me off my feet with taste, I might've thought otherwise. I see the effort in making an off-the-menu veggie friendly dish, and I acknowledge that, but it just wasn't dish presentable.   This place gets an \"A\" for effort, but a decent ''C\" for veggie presentation. :)",

    "text": "This is the only place I have ever wished I could give a negative amount of stars on Yelp.  Terrible, terrible, awful, horrible.  I understand that their main demographic are gambling, intoxicated people. I also understand that they're not catering to repeat customers because Las Vegas is a destination. But even so, there is no excuse for the dinner we had there over Labor Day weekend.  Bad food: French onion soup was a black, burnt piece of bread sitting in room temperature, flavorless broth. Barely any liquid. Scampi linguine had obviously frozen, expired shrimp and tasteless noodles.   Worse service: When we asked for a table for four, the middle-aged hostess stared blankly past us for about thirty seconds (it wasn't busy, she was daydreaming) before sighing, gathering four menus, and dragging her feet to lead us to a table. We sat for ten minutes without service. Once our waters finally arrived, they were never refilled throughout the course of the evening. We requested bread before the meal. It came after our entrees had arrived. The sides with the burgers weren't what was ordered. Our server disappeared and ignored us until it was time to drop the check. Didn't clear our plates.   The worst part of the experience was the very end. AFTER we had already paid with credit cards, the server (who had been missing in action all night) stood directly over us, watching us write our tips to see what we would write. I know that perhaps servers need to hover when people haven't paid yet since it's Vegas and dine and dashing is probably frequent, but we had already paid! I had barely put the pen down before she was pulling the check presenter out of my hands. Completely rude and inexcusable.   If she had given us even fair service, she wouldn't have felt like she had to supervise our tip writing like a hawk in order to guilt trip us into 18%. She didn't get it anyway.  Will never, ever go back and will warn Paris-bound friends to stay far, far away.",

As a Food Francophile I'm easily taken in by the decor of this place.   The Provencal restaurant was closed for lunch, the line for the buffet too long and it was far to warm to eat at Mon Ami Gabi the outdoor restaurant.  So needing food sooner than later we ate at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis.   A quick look at the menu and gazing around brought me back into reality. This is a glorified coffee shop dressed in French clothes. One big clue was the Chinese menu items on the addendum page. The caprese sandwich we ordered was served on French wonder bread with a undercooked, bland potato salad. I bravely ordered Chinese broccoli and sausage it was actually somewhat satisfying.   This is a passable hotel coffee shop, nothing else. For a French experience in LV, Bouchon or Pinot Brasserie in the Venetian are good options.",

I ate here at 8am on a Saturday and was seated with my co-worker right away (inside seating). We were asked if we wanted coffee/OJ right away and it arrived promptly. Our server came over shortly after and while not super friendly, was able to set me up with some scrambled egg whites and fruit (not on their normal menu).

I so enjoy playing Keno, my brother in law and I decided to play ten games, as we waited for our lunch. We started with a cheese platter with a fresh baguette, and fruit.  The fruit was very fresh especially the strawberries and blueberries.  I ordered a salad and half sandwich for lunch.  My salad was crisp and good but my sandwich was cold chopped up chicken, in which I do not like so I did not touch.  My fault I should have asked if it was grilled chicken.  No biggie I filled up on salad. My sister and brother in law both ordered mushroom crepe's in which they said was very good.  Neither one of us hit anything on Keno, bummer.  Lunch was OK,  it was as if we were dining at a diner.  Not to far in the shopping area there was a small cafe that we wished we would have ate at, they had fresh sandwiches, salads that looked incredible and cheese platters with some amazing looking desserts.  Service was slow and not very friendly here.",

She threw the food at us. I didn't care for her snippy attitude or for the poor quality food.   I worked in food service for years. I never have attitude or first did any harm to customers, so I know how \"hard\" her job is. I'm so sick of people rushing to the defense of bad servers. Yes, some customers are trouble, but not always. Sometimes it's the server who is the problem, especially if it's someone like Adrianna. No excuse for this behavior.  The manager didn't care at all. I hope this place goes under.",

They were pretty good and really filling, to the point that I couldn't finish the last slice. I also got a side of bacon. I like bacon that is a little bit burnt but this was a little too burnt. It was still alright but the bacon slices were too small too. The restaurant was nice and decorated like an authentic little cafe straight out of France.  It was overall a nice place to eat and if you're at the Paris, you should check it out!",

First of all, it took the waiter a while to come to our table in the first place. By the time he got to us we were ready to order. My dad tried ordering wine, but their wine list was out-of-date and they didn't have several of the bottles of wine we wanted to order. We got the Merlot, it was okay.  We ordered three steaks, medium rare. Mine was rare, my friend's was so raw it was still grazing the asparagus (which he had specifically asked be removed in his order), and my brother's came out just right.  We sent back the raw steak for a longer cook time... it came back rare and cold about ten minutes later....  By then I had given up on my steak, anyway, so my friend finished it off.  My mom ordered the Croque Madame, which was awful and under-cooked (surprise!) and the creamed spinach that came with my order was clumpy and cold.  The only good thing about this place was the bread and butter (which took forever to get). However, when we asked for oil and vinegar for the bread, we were told there wasn't any. When we pointed out that another guy at a table had it, they went over, took it off his table, and put it on ours! Sorry guy!   Seriously, I have low expectations from Las Vegas to begin with, but this was unacceptable.  The over-all experience was so awful I went out of my way to make sure this place exists on Yelp so I can warn future patrons.   GO TO THE BUFFET INSTEAD! Or at least go to Mon Ami Gabi instead.",

The cafe is easy and fast. It's really like a French cafe feel. I guess you get different a different waiter all the time and your experience will vary.   I love the \"Croque Madame\" it's a French hot sandwich made of soft bread cheese and ham. That alone is the \"Croque Monsieur\". Topped it with a sunny side up egg and it's called \"Croque Madame\". I tried it twice and really loved it. I am French and I am always very skeptical to eat so called \"French\" food.  The croc as we call it is very soft. I like the bread used. Not your usual toast bread! It's thicker and very soft. If you know Croque Madame you need to try this one.   I also had Napoleon. Which we called Mille feuilles. It's a bit different cream inside. Usually it's made of custard and not whip cream.  It was not too sweet so I liked it.   The chocolate mousse was really good.   In conclusion we enjoyed our food. Got twice good service. Like the convenient location. Closest place to eat when you stay at the hotel. You are outside whatever the weather is.",

I'm guilty of eating here a few times cause I can skip the line with my player's status and I'm lazy. But food is pricey for what you get and they can't cook a steak properly.  I will say the bread service is the best part, but that's not a good thing.  I'm not even gonna lie, I'll probably eat here again.  Probably a few times.

We woke up Monday morning craving eggs benedict, and figured a cafe in a french themed hotel should fit the bill nicely.  Maybe we made a mistake.  The food was fine,.. when we finally decided what we were able to order, that is.   Although my wife wanted eggs, I was thinking more about the crepes...and was told that they had been out of them for two days.   A french cafe out of crepes?    After picking something else, i decided that the bacon bloodymary would be a nice addition to my meal...I was on vacation, after all. I was told that they didn't have a bartender during the week.  (The cafe is located about 30 feet from a casino bar).  The kicker was at the end of the meal when i received our bill.  It was only $32.00!  I should have just paid that one, and left, considering our bill was actually $61.00, but being honest, I let her know about the mistake.  food was fine, but not happy about the shortcomings of the orderer, or our server.",

The sandwich I chose was a tuna salad and was okay (it just lacked a bit of flavor).  I think what I really like about coming to this cafe is the outside \"patio.\" It's quite pretty and somewhat romantic :).",

    "text": "\"Should Had Known Better Based On Our Waiter's Attitude To Walk Away\"  Went there for a late dinner on 11/27/2014 with my husband. As soon as we sat down out on the casino floor, my husband left to take a call. The waiter came by with a rather \"I don't want to be here, but I have to, so deal with it\" attitude. I asked him for his recommendation on their Croque Madame Sandwich was since I had previously had it at the Mom Ami Gabi there at Paris and found it be extremely bad. His response was why did you have it? Well because I normally like them, and it turned out to not be so good. He then said, \"if you didn't like theirs, I am pretty sure you won't like the one from here either, their food is better.\" \"Ok, we are off to a good start\" I thought. When my husband returned, he looked tired and hungry, so I did not mentioned the conversation I had with our waiter.   The waiter came back, and disdainfully took our orders. My husband then mention to me, \"what is wrong with him, looks like he has an attitude and we just sat down to eat, he seems a bit odd.\" At this point, I just wanted to eat and go as fast as possible. I had the St. Louis Club and my husband had the Turkey Croissant. Both were less than average. In addition we ordered the Cheese Fondue, it was average at best.  The waiter came by once and asked if we needed more water, my husband said, yes for him. Another 10 minutes went by and my husband decided he would just get the water himself from the waiter station. At this point when he saw my husband headed to get the water he came running and started pouring the water, half of it ended on my husband's plate. He did apologized out of fear my husband would get upset. However, my husband didn't get upset with him; he just brushed it off since we just wanted to leave. At this point, I understood why another couple who was paying their bill when we had just sat down were looking at him in a way like \" what is his problem\"? Another sign we should have walked away before ordering.   So after a very lack luster, unusual, weird, and nuts dinner, we paid the bill and left. After we left I realized I had left my sweater behind so I told my husband I needed to go back. I did and the waiter mockingly pointed in front of the last group of diners that it was inside and to go get it. Of course my husband was not with me at this point, so he was his old mean, weird, crazy self. I went inside picked up the sweater and ran out rather embarrassed. I really meant to go back and speak to management the next day and tell them about our experience, but just ran out of time. If the restaurant's management hires people like him, then I am sure my words would have fallen on deaf ears. Please do not waste your time and money on this place. It is lovely to look at but it is bad to the core in more ways than one.",

I do know we ordered the Croque Monsieur, a couple French Onion Soups, 2 Roasted Beet Salads, Seared Tuna Salad, 2 burgers, and some other things.   The tiny Croque Monsieur was fine but when we got it, it looked like a large plate with a random block of brown sitting haphazardly on it. However, fair enough, it was decent.   The Roasted Beet Salad was fine, too, but I've had better and I didn't even realize there was beet in the salad until about half-way into eating it.  The French Onion Soup would have been good if it weren't for how salty it was. I'm pretty sure it would have been good. I couldn't really tell from all the salt.  The food wasn't at the level that I was expecting but at $4 per person for all that food, I had a happy belly and wallet.",

It was the WORST service and food I have had in a long  time, and EXTREMELY overpriced (particularly considering the awful food and awful service).  My husband and I got mimosas (why not? we are on vacation) and they were $9 each.  We expected a large wine glass for our $9.  Instead, we received the smallest, tiniest champagne glass I have ever see.  It was a shot of champagne for $9. No thanks. I'll pass.    Then my husband and I got the eggs Benedict to eat.  He got the traditional and I got their special one.  All of the eggs were overcooked, 2 didn't even run out when you broke them open.  They were basically hard boiled eggs.  The sauce over them was tasteless and cold.  Everything, in fact, was cold and unseasoned.  It was awful.    The service through the entire meal was awful but when we tried to pay the bill, we were ignored for at least 20 minutes.   We almost walked out and I have never walked out on a check.  When I finally got up to complain and get someone to take our credit card, the manager brought the check but did not ask how the food was or if everything was ok.  Even the management didn't care.  This is cafeteria food for $20+ per plate. There are farrrrr better places in Vegas and even in the paris to eat, for much much more reasonable of a price.",

    "text": "Le Cafe Ile St. Louis is located in the Paris hotel adjacent to its casino.  The kitchen is open daily from 6:00 a.m. to ll:00 p.m. and the bar 24 hours.  It is very nicely designed and decorated to imitate a Parisian bistro with an \"outdoor\" patio.     My wife and I recently breakfasted there on a weekday morning.  The dining areas were filled less than 50% capacity, and we were seated immediately in the patio next to the brass perimeter railing that afforded us a good view of the restaurant and the casino.   My wife ordered an omelet with mascarpone with a side of sausage, and I chose scrambled eggs and bacon with fingerling potatoes.  After a very long wait, our food arrived without the sausage.  Our waiter said the sausage was on its way and then he disappeared.  We started to eat, and after a very lengthy period of time I spotted our waiter heading our way with covered dishes.  I thought that one contained the sausage, however, he breezed past our table without a word and served a party next to us who had been seated well after us.  Before I could get his attention, he disappeared again.  We were just about finished with our food when our waiter reappeared.  I flagged him down and asked what happened to the sausage.  Without offering any regrets or apology whatsoever, he assumed an attitude of indifference and merely said that there was a mix-up in the kitchen.  He was then about to walk away, but I stopped him and stated that I wanted the cost of my wife's breakfast taken off the bill.  When the bill arrived, we were not charged for my wife's meal and nothing further was spoken between our waiter and me.  As to the quality of the food we did have, my wife's omelet was average.  It was the same for my food except the potatoes were very greasy and went mostly untouched.  Due to the wholly unprofessional service as well as the mediocre quality of the food, I strongly suggest passing on Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.",

Service was slow and not friendly. We had a larger group and needed the checks to be split. The wait staff and cashier was really bitter. The cashier told us to split it ourselves and tell her how much to put on each check. We ended up needing to call the manager and he graciously split the check for us based on what we ordered. He said he was happy to do it and it took him all of 3 minutes.   After he left, the cashier said, \"You should have asked to split the check when you ordered! It would have made everything easier.\" Um, wow, the manager just said it was fine and it took him less than 5 minutes. She was lazy and had to have the last word.   It was an awful experience. There are so many good places to eat in Vegas. Don't waste your time at this one!!",

I'll make this brief: The service was horrible, the selections from the menu were appallingly small, and the silverware was filthy.   In the Paris Hotel of all places! I asked for Beschemel and the server looked at me quizzically and stated, \"Uh, I don't think so, but we have Cholula and Tapatio if you want.\"  Why the f@#k would I want hot sauce in stead of Beschemel? That's like asking for gravy and being offered hot wing sauce. WTF?  I ordered up an omelette that had to be sent back twice because it looked like it was made of burlap. The manager said they had a new cook, but you'd think a cook in Vegas could handle an omelette.   They had no French Vanilla creamer for coffee (mind you, this is in the Paris.)  They're lucky I can't give them no stars.",

We have been here a few times because of the convenience factor when we stay at the Paris, but it's really not worth coming to.  The eggs are not fluffy at all, flavorless, and seem old.  My boyfriend and his family all enjoy ordering steak and eggs here, but I don't think they're too picky about their meat.  They always bring a basket of bread to go with all the orders - which is probably the only good part of the meal.  I've ordered a chocolate croissant twice here now, and it's been different both times.  Most recently it was better, but oddly the croissant was not what you'd expect of a restaurant inside the Paris hotel.  It was not crispy, flaky, or buttery.  The chocolate inside was decent, but it was a little overwhelming.  Even though I'm a chocolate lover - I ended up leaving more than half the chocolate on the plate.  It spilled out everywhere, and overpowered the (not so great) croissant.  Would not recommend, or return!",

We booked a table thru OpenTable and got it right away. What a great place this turned out to be, we were pleasantly greeted on arrival and in spite of it being quite busy we managed to get a seating outdoors lol! We were served promptly and politely and being famished we devoured the French Bread and Butter and it was divine! We both started with the French Onion Soup (Heavenly) and the wife ordered the Croque Monsieur and I ordered the Salmon with Asparagus served on Mash Potatoes!  Both our dishes were Deeelish and to top it off we both indulged in the Napolean for dessert and I must say that too was amazing! This was definitely one of the best French lunches we have ever had! Will definitely be back...this place should be at least 4.5 stars!!",

I had clam chowder in a bread bowl that was wonderful. Plenty of clams, perfectly seasoned with the right amount of pepper, and a large sour dough bread bowl that was fresh.  The sandwiches that were ordered were not amazing, but they were okay.  A Caesar salad was ordered that may or may not have been the cause of some stomach discomfort for one of the members of our party, so I'm fine with dropping this down to 3 stars.

Read the menu at this cafe in the Paris Hotel, and it looked good.  Ordered the Steak Frites, a nice flat steak with french fries, a bearnaise and a bordelaise sauce accompaniment. Also ordered a mixed green salad....  The service was good, attentive, and efficient. The bread came rather late, with nearly frozen butter, but worked around that faux pas.  The salad was really good.  The steak was on the tougher side, but cooked to perfection. It looked like a top sirloin, but semi-sliced before cooking to give it a pattern on top. It was okay, but not what I'd hoped for. The sauces it came with were weak and flavorless. Had to salt and pepper both of them just to get some taste on the steak. The bearnaise sauce was the weakest, and not the classical version. The bordelaise needed the salt the most, but was closest to what you'd expect in a classic French reduction sauce, but tasted jarred, or mass produced...not from the pan my steak was made in.  Overall, the experience was okay, nothing to write home about. And with so many other Vegas options, can't see myself ever returning. I would recommend this place only if hungry, and currently at the Paris Hotel, and you don't mind the casino right there as you eat. Not worth a special trip for.",

The service in the middle of the day isn't bad we got the bread and water within 5mins of being seated.   Last time the water did taste like chlorine but they seemed to have fixed that. Personally I wouldn't order chinese at le cafe odd that it would even be an option. Especially with the prices.   Duck crepe was good and really filling probably should've split it. I've had poor service here before but this time the waiters were present, friendly and attentive. The food isn't cheap but not bad if you order with the theme of the place.

Almost like being in a european cafe that just happens to be in the middle of a large casino.  The wait was minimal on a weekday morning, and our server was great. My boo had the quiche and I had the french toast with banana at the suggestion of our waiter who was great, but I can't remember his name (sorry man). French toast was excellent. Really hit the spot. My boo was very pleased with the quiche. Pricewise I thought breakfast was reasonable.   I would definitely go back.",

While wandering Paris Casino looking for a place to have brunch/lunch we stumbled upon this one and got ourselves a table on the 'courtyard' section.  Nice people watching.  Service was wonderful and everyone was very friendly.  Plus if you're a Total Rewards member then you get a discount on most menu items :)  Coffee was great (always a good sign) since we love coffee and there's nothing more disappointing than bad coffee to start the day... Food came out pretty quickly and everything was delicious.  I guess we had low expectations from reading reviews AFTER we were seated but we were all pleased with our dishes.  So no idea what people were eating and when but our brunch was great!!",

When she asked what a certain sauce was in one of the crepes, the waitress didn't know. She just said, a \"white sauce.\" What do you know, goat cheese. she ate one bite and lost her appetite. When she tried to tell the waitress that, she had to word it differently about 5 times before she understood. She didn't order anything else.  Did I mention as soon as we sat down, they tried to push all sorts of alcoholic drinks on us by pointing them out on the menu and going \"ooh\" and \"look at that\". Guess what, I've been getting free drinks all day if I sit there on the slot machines, so why should i spend anything here? I ordered a sprite, and my girlfriend ordered a water. They proceeded to bring two waters and never refill them. I think I ordered a seafood crepe, but after all that happened, I don't even remember if it was good or not.",

Next we ordered our food, while waiting for our food we noticed other tables had bread. Waited about another 5 minutes, no bread. Asked another waitress who had just brought bread to a table that was seated after us if we could get some bread. She said that \"he\" would bring it to us. Not sure which \"he\" she was referring to. Needless to say we waited and waited no bread. After about 30 minutes our food arrived. My friend had asked for her burger well done and avocado on the side. The burger was medium  and the avocado was in it. About 10 minutes after we got our food Julie comes back over and asks us if we have room for dessert while holding the check in her hand. At this point we are only about half way through our meal. She says she will leave the check for us. We finished our meals and as soon as I put my credit card down to pay Julie rushed over to our table asking to run my card for me. Since there were 3 of us we wanted to split the check. Julie split the check but charged one of our cards twice failing to charge the other. Overall the food was good but the service was awful. I felt rushed the entire time plus it wasn't even a busy time to go out to eat. This all happened at 2 in the afternoon on a Wednesday.",

She told us to wait 20 minutes because they were busy and brushed us off. We stood in line for 45 minutes until the manager came and we ask if there are any seats. He said yes but told us to wait in their diamond vip area. That area by the way is just an ugly blue bench in the hall way. We finally get to our table and the server comes to give us water. I was about to ask him a question on the menu but he said \"it's not my job\" and left. The food server later came and looked obviously annoyed. We were picking our food and he asked us to hurry up because he has another table waiting. We then asked for wine and he rolled his eyes and stepped away. The manager didn't seem to care when we told him our concerns. Needless to say if you walk all day on the Vegas strip and are looking for a place to relax and eat and end up in Paris...DO NOT COME HERE!",

    "text": "Avoid. There are too many other good options in the area.  We went for breakfast and approached the hostess stand and stood there for a minute while the hostess carried on a conversation with one of the casino maintenance workers. The hostess then looked at us (no greeting) and told us it would be another few minutes before a table for two was ready. She then went back to her conversation with the maintenance worker. I stared at her for about 4 minutes until she was done with her conversation, and then, guess what? Our table was ready! I thought someone was playing a joke on me, not to mention there were a bunch of open tables in the restaurant. By the time she was done with her conversation, there were about 8 other people waiting in the line behind us to be seated.  Overall, the food wasn't what I was expecting. I have a pretty simple definition of a \"breakfast sandwich\": typically, meat, egg, cheese, etc between two pieces of bread that I can pick up with my hands. If that is not what is being served, I would appreciate a heads up or detail on the menu. When I ordered my sandwich, I asked for no mornay sauce and the waiter said that wasn't possible, so i'm guessing they are pre-made. Anyway, what was served to us was more like a casserole that you had to eat with a knife and fork than a sandwich. The ham and mornay sauce were between two thick pieces of brioche and the bread was topped with a sunny side up egg....again, not a sandwich. I had to scrape off the egg (im not a raw-yolk person) and probably only ate about half of what was there.  I would recommend going somewhere else for breakfast. There are so many options in Vegas...even the little bakery 10 feet from the entrance to the Cafe looked like a better option.

    "text": "While perusing the 'streets' of Paris hotel we stopped in front of Le Cafe and the place looked poppin so we decided to stop and look at the menu as well as refer back to trusty Yelp.  The menu options looked pretty okay as well as affordable, but the reviews on Yelp complained about the service.  Usually I steer clear from places with horrible ratings on their customer service, but we realized we'd never eat if we didn't just choose a place to eat at already so Le Cafe it was.   Right from the get-go the lady serving as the hostess up front was just rude, short and had no business being the first person any patron would have to cross before dining here.  Seriously, take the stick out of your ass.  So we wait and wait for a table when while passing the restaurant we had seen so many open tables for us to be seated at.  Then a group of older ladies come over showing their little card or something and they bypassed the line and were seated even though they just barely walked up 5 seconds ago.  10 minutes later we're taken to our table and it's filthy.  Trash from the previous diners were still on the table and the dickhead hostess just starts brushing off crumbs on the table cloth, um okay what about the food stains?  What are you going to suck those off or something?  So when my gf asks if we can have a table in the other patio since it has so many open tables the biatch WITH attitude asks if we want to wait.  Oh excuse me, how rude of us to not find the dirty ass table you made us wait for acceptable.  Right after that another lady brings over a fresh table cloth... okay 1/2 star for that.    Ordering and waiter service was a nightmare.  It was a total and complete joke, I think I actually even started laughing in the middle of it all just because it was so shitty.  It took forever to get the waiter to take our orders and a day to get some bread & butter like the group who had arrived & ordered AFTER us received.  When I tried to flag the waiter, then just any waiter as I seemed to have been invisible to all the muthafuggin service people at this joint for some bread, the waiter literally kept walking away from me telling me while pointing at our waiter who was ignoring us the entire time that we needed to ask him instead.  Are you freaking kidding me???  Knowing we had a night of clubbing in tight dresses awaiting us we decided to go for their soup & salad combo and an order of some frites.  I chose the french onion soup with their frise with lardon salad, while the buddy got chicken noodle soup with caesar salad.  Portions were good, taste was subpar at best.  The instant noodles we had in our hotel room tasted better than the soups set before us.  My salad was boring and tasteless while the best part of my friend's caesar salad was the crouton and Albertson's deli prepackaged caesar salad's croutons taste better.  We never got our frites, which was fine with us as we could tell from the food we had already tasted we weren't going to miss out on much.  By the end of the meal we just wanted to get the f*ck out of there, but once again it was nearly impossible getting our waiter to pay attention to us.  Even those ladies who bypassed the line and were seated before us in the beginning were starting to complain about the horridness of Le Cafe's service.  And of course, those ladies received service before us once a-f*cking-gain.    When we finally got some service I mentioned that they never brought us our frites so they needed to remove it from our bill.  Then the waiting game once again ensued for the actual bill, and what do we see when we finally get the bill?  The charge for the frites.  Like wow, are you guys just playing some nasty ass sick joke on us?  MTV's Boiling Point is that you???   My buddy catching glimpse of the manager quickly got his attention and just went to town on all the bullshit we had to put up including the disgusting food.  He tried to remedy the situation by offering us a dessert on the house which we responded to by giving him our does-it-look-like-we-want-to-waste-another-fuggin-second-here-at-this-shit-hole look and telling him we just wanted to get out of here.  He came back with the new bill in which he comped us for one of the soup & salad combos and removed the never received frites.  Another 1/2 star for the manager, but really he should have comped the whole meal because I would not eat here even for free.  Upon paying and leaving I did something I never do, left no tip, at least no monetary tip... just a written tip.  A not-so-nice one at that.    I WOULD NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE and suggest you don't even waste your time or money.",

    "text": "I stopped here twice this week during my stay at Paris Hotel & Casino. It was one of the only \"reasonably\" priced options in the hotel where I could catch a meal almost any time. The first experience I had was over breakfast. My food was mediocre at best, but the coffee was good and my server Jamie was a sweetheart. It won me over enough to go back for a late night snack a couple days later I took in a show at another hotel. This time around I ordered the Paris Burger which had brie cheese, bacon, and caramelized onions. Even with such wonderful ingredients the burger wasn't all that special. My bun was very hard and tasted old, and my meat was way overcooked. Worst of all, the service this time around was atrocious. I did not catch my waiters name, but he was very rude with our table and I observed similar behavior when he interacted with other tables. I'd give the restaurant a single star rating after my burger experience, but Jamie was an incredible server. I'd honestly probably go back for breakfast if I saw she was working.",

The presentation of each meal was very eye-pleasing. The rolls (with several jams) were fresh, delicious, and generous. We liked the ($39 a bottle) William Hill Merlot.      Our water glasses were refilled frequently and the noise level was very low. Jennifer, our waitress was excellent. She was friendly, efficient, attentive, and welcoming. Jennifer made every effort to make sure our meal was enjoyable. We highly recommend Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.",

Whenever we wish to eat here, they use a table top holder with a picture of a star to denote Seven Star, first service stature. But it never works that way. Then they will escort you to a table and place this table top stand to tell the waiters to serve asap. Which just doesn't happen, in fact it looks as if they take delight in ignoring the star. At this point, I don't really care how good the food may be, just another disappointing waste of time.",

The croissant sandwich was fresh and the applewood bacon made the sandwich that much better.  Our server, Dennis, was the icing on the cake.

I visited during that meal wasteland between lunch and dinner, right at 3:30p. Luckily, they were still serving lunch, which is what I wanted.  The prices were a bit on the high side, but considering it is a Strip restaurant, I guess I couldn't expect them to be much lower. My ham, egg, and cheese sandwich (of course it was called something fancier) with fries was $16.  My meal was tasty, though. The fries were nicely seasoned, hot, a little crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, which is how I like them. The sandwich was also very good, a soft egg atop cheese, ham, and beautiful, thick, soft, bread. No complaints there!  So, why only the 3 star review? The service was pretty absent. We had to ask 3 people for our check because our server disappeared , and even still ended up having to go to the counter to get someone to give us our check and cash out. While I enjoyed my meal, I didn't want to be held hostage there all day!",

    "text": "My husband and I had a 3 course set dinner last night. We were a bit worried because of some bad reviews. But we still gave it a shot and try, and the food turned out to be delicious to us. We got French onion soup as appetizer, and then prime rib as entree. We chose chocolate layered cake as dessert. We liked all of them.   The onion soup tasted really good, we liked that they don't put much black pepper (or probably none) to over-power the taste of onion. But if you like black pepper, then probably you won't like it though we liked it. The prime rib was good, it came in good size, they said it was 12 oz and we think so too. It would be even better if they have fresh horseradish, but we were satisfied enough with the quality of prime rib though there was only creamed horseradish. We got to choose 2 sides with the entree. I chose Yukon whipped potato and French fries, while my husband chose baked potato and creamed spinach. I liked the Yukon whipped potato a lot. French fries was over burned though. I didn't make a big deal about it because I had pretty enough to eat already. My husband thought his sides were okay, not bad but not wow either. Both of our rib eyes came out with the correct doneness we asked for. At the end when dessert came, we liked the layered chocolate cake a lot too. I think it is pretty safe to go for the set dinner. We don't know how it would be if we were to order items off the regular menu.  If we go back in the future, we probably will do set dinner again because it was good priced and portion is just right.",

Now, it's a little bit more pricey for the food but its not bad food. This time I had the french dip which was tasty and delicious and their spinach salad which was fresh and good too.   I didn't care for their french onion soup last time, but maybe it was since I wasn't a fan.   HIt or miss with the service here. Sometimes you get a good server... and sometimes you don't. It's Vegas. Take a gamble!",

Because I was still stuffed from eating at the Wynn buffet earlier that afternoon, I opted for the chicken noodle soup.  It was absolutely awful....waaay too salty!  It was by far the worst chicken noodle soup I ever tasted.  I enjoyed the crackers it came with more than the soup.      The service was soo slow too, to get our food and the bill back twice...supposedly there was something wrong with one of my friend's credit card.  The waitress also had a not so pleasant attitude.  Ooo and btw if you want to get a dish split, it'll cost you $6 just for the extra plate.  Don't come here to eat; there's plenty of other 24 hour cafes in the other casinos like the one at Wynn which has better food & service.",

Plan on allotting at least twenty minutes to order and wait for your food. Twice I saw them pick up my sandwich only to have them put it down and pick up an order placed after mine.   Second, the food wasn't that good. Everything had cheese and their were very few healthy choices, but that does keep in the French tradition.  Finally, expect to get gouged on the price. You have few choices other so they know they have you on the price.",

How much, y'think?   Yeah, $36!!!   I don't f***ing think so.  The orange juice was ok, but certainly was not fresh squeezed.  I'm thinking it's coming straight out of the minute maid bottle.   The coffee tasted very light though was very efficient, so my wife were actually thinking that they served caffeine water with black coloring.   In other words, it got us all jittery and wiry, but it didn't taste like coffee.  The eggs were cooked rather poorly, the bacon didn't look all that appetizing (didn't try it though), and the chocolate croissant, for it being \"Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis\", was really tragic.  Now had all this been priced at the cost Denny's would have charged us, I'd probably give them 4.5 or 5 stars and wouldn't complain one bit.  Certainly the food I had did not outshine Denny's at all.   But $36 for this (ok ok... $30 + 20% tip, but still!!!)   No, some Parisian's seriously smoking crack on the Ile St Louis if he thinks that this is competitive pricing.  I'll give 'em 3 stars because everything in Vegas has become overprice, but let's just say I'd more likely show a smile than shed a tear if I ever heard that this place went \"Au Revoir!\"",

    "text": "Sitting below an illuminated ceiling of blue skies and puffy clouds, Le Cafe was built to feel like the outdoor cafes of Paris. On the outside it looks and might even feel like a place to sit and chat while sipping a cappuccino, but being that it's open 24 hours and just heels away from the noisy casino floor of Paris Las Vegas, it's really just a diner.  Every casino has a diner and due to the nature of Vegas, they're typically the most popular places to eat at all hours of the day. Le Cafe is somewhere in the middle of the diner spectrum, neither exceptional nor completely downtrodden, offering a typical menu of American food and faux-French food.  Something I always found decent was their breakfast food. Sausage links, tasty omelettes, and hash browns was a meal they could whip up quickly and rather decently. Some of their sandwiches (namely the French dip) were passable for a solid lunch time option and some of the usual baked pastries that were done daily.  Having sampled lots of baguette combos, crepes, French onion soup, I just avoid the French items on their menu completely. Most all I've had were mediocre, uninspiring, and overpriced. This is no surprise for any casino cafe / diner establishment, but it's like going to a Japanese place only to find out the burger tastes better than soba / udon / ramen. As a result, some of my colleagues during my time here would commonly refer to this place as, \"Le Crap.\"  But I am not much of a hater. Paris already is plagued with subpar eateries and most of them are closed before 11pm, which leaves the late night goers few options to enjoy. The key to these types of places is embracing what they do best, which for me was almost always breakfast. Service was for the most part pleasant always and the prices were casino worthy, but thankfully this kind of food is the easiest to comp with player points.",

We ended up just putting our room number and charging it to the room on our check because the waiter would not come back to let us pay.   The ambiance is that of a little cafe in Paris.

While it did take about 8 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order, she was very busy and it wasn't her fault.  Since we were dining about 11am, when breakfast shifts to lunch, I was able to order breakfast while my wife ordered from the lunch menu.  My wife loved her Turkey and bacon sandwich on a Croissant, and said it tasted amazing. I got the Corned Beef Hash with Poached Eggs and it too was very yummy!",

    "text": "We originally wanted to go to Mon Abi Gabi, but the line was ridiculous and we didn't have a reservation.  Since all we really wanted to do was get a decent meal and then go out play some games (vs. standing in line), we decided to walk around and see what else there was.  Ran into this place with no line.  Probably a sign of what to expect, but we didn't care at this point.    They seated us right away.  Yay!  Menu wasn't that bad, but our waiter was horrible.  I asked him about some of the beers on the menu and he couldn't answer.  I then asked him if the beers were just light colored or dark colored and he said he didn't know.  Okay whatever, give me the french beer since this is supposed to be a french establishment.  Also asked him a few other questions about the menu such as, \"what's one of the popular items?\"  He just kept pointing us to the specials.  Well I actually ended up ordering the special.  That night it was something along the lines of 'american in paris.'  How bad could it be?    Ribeye.  How can you mess that up?  Well I guess if the cow that it comes from is low grade ghetto, then I guess its not gonna taste that good.  I felt like I was eating a steak and eggs meal at Denny's.  It was bad.  Meal also came with 2 sides.  I ordered a baked potato and the creamed spinach.  The creamed spinach was actually pretty good, but the baked potato that came out was mac n cheese (dude got the order wrong).  I didn't care and ate the mac n cheese anyways cause I was hungry and I was fine with it.  It wasn't bad, wasn't the best either.  The ribeye killed it though.  I could have gotten a better ribeye anywhere else (maybe even Denny's).    The French Onion Soup was pretty good.  Or maybe it was the first thing I ate there and I was super hungry.  I couldn't tell.  All in all, mediocre establishment and horrendous service.  I would save your time and money and get some crepes across the walkway there.  Or if you had more patience than us, wait in line at Mon Abi Gabi.",

We wanted a nice dinner before going to see the Jersey Boys and Mon Ami Gabi was a little too expensive for everyone's taste.   We made a reservation and they sat us immediately. The drinks came fast and the waiter was very attentive.   Everything we had was very good. Steaks, chicken, beef tenderloin, salads, etc. Everyone enjoyed the food very much.   I didn't have a lot to say. I just wanted to give them a good review because we didn't have any of the experience others have had.   Props to our waiter - he was excellent with an awesome sense of humor.",

    "text": "After a morning full of sight seeing and window browsing, my family and I were ready to eat. We looked around and every food vender and restaurant had lines for days. We noticed a short line at this restaurant and decided to this would so. Turns out they hadn't opened for lunch yet but it was only a 15 minute wait, not too bad.  After being seated, we were greeted by the most cheerful waiter I have ever met. I'm 97% sure his name was Dennis. I ordered the Salmon Burger, my mom got the Foie Gras Burger, Dad and brother ordered Beef Bourguignon, other brother got Steak Frites. As we were waiting, we were given bread. It was crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, my dad liked it so much he asked for more. I admit the wait for food was very long but rather than just being left at the table, Dennis was updating us very often and cracking jokes with us.   I have to say that even though it's not very French, I enjoyed my salmon burger. It was tender and not the least bit dry. The dill mayo was on point. My moms Foie Gras burger was delicious, I've never thought of putting a slice of apple in a burger before but it was genius. The Beef Bourguignon was super tender and savory but my brother's Steak Frites was just alright. The dishes that stood out the most out of this meal were my the Foie Gras Burger and the Beef Bourguignon.  All in all, if you're hungry and not picky, I suggest coming here. It's not the best place to go for French food, I mean, over half of the items are American. With decent food bit great service, I give four stars for our overall experience.",

I ordered French Onion Soup and a Caprese salad. The man had a French Dip with French fries.   The soup was ok. Broth was a bit off tasting but we couldn't pin point why. The caprese salad was awful. So bad that we both agreed to not eat more and to send it back. It was served with both red and yellow tomatoes and only 3 slices of mozzerella. Kind of stingy for this kind of salad, but it was the tomatoes that killed the dish. They were not ripe and they were so cold they were hardly edible even if some of them would have been ripe. The sandwich was cafeteria fare at best, but what clinched this place as going on my shit list was the service.   I have a long list of jobs I have held in my time. I will not go through the list here, but know that jobs that revolve around food and customer service are on said list. This being said, our waiter did not come back until we were blatantly waiting for the bill/some acknowledgement. When I told our waiter the salad was \"not good because the tomatoes were not ripe\", he told me \"the salad does not come with cooked tomatoes\". I told him he was not understanding what I was saying, that I was saying that the tomatoes were \"NOT RIPE\", he then told me \"well, that is how this salad comes\". I told him not to argue with the customer and to take the salad off of our bill. Needless to say, this was a first for me. I totally stiffed him on any kind of tip what-so-ever and a little part of me wished I could have skipped out on the whole bill all together.  Do yourselves a favor....don't eat here!",

I came here 2 days in a row. Each time was progressively horrible. The management is a fat fucking asshole. (it was not my choice to come here either, I was obligated since it was my  mother-in-laws choice) After getting into a heated argument with my waitress for being a dumb rude bitch i decided i will NOT come back here again.",

I questioned the waiter, and he said Le Cafe Ile St. Louis has a secret Chinese menu. That's right, Shanghai dumplings, congee, braised oxtail. Far more interesting choices than the fish and chips I had already ordered, and probably tastier than the bland crap I was eventually served.  Although I must note I witnessed the teenage daughter in this Asian family repeatedly spitting her food out into her napkin, so this probably isn't the best place for any type of cuisine.",

    "text": "I'm solely rating this place based on breakfast.    Ile St. Louis Cafe is a traditional coffee shop where the menu has a some french flair.   After a night of dancing and drinking we actually tried to get in this place at 3am but it didn't happen because the wait was long and the waiter ratio was low so we skipped and decided to come here the following morning.  The wait didn't take long, approx 5 minutes.  I ordered the eggs benedict he ordered some breakfast combo which consisted of eggs, bacon, and I believe french toast?  My meal was good but I couldn't finish it. My meal consisted of two eggs benedict and hash browns.  Portions are slightly smaller than what I'm used to up here in San Jose but it was good.  Hash browns could use a little more crunch but it was still tasty.  Overall I would give this place 3.5 stars.  Service was good but towards the end they kind of lagged and took forever to get the check.  It was a busy Sunday morning I guess.  Not bad and open for 24 hours.",

I came here for dinner Saturday night.  I ordered the french onion soup.  For some reason, I was actually expecting it to be worse, but it was okay.  The piece of bread they put in my soup was huge and they had so much chesse on top, but the broth was pretty tasty.  The turkey wrap I order was lackluster though.  It didn't have much taste at all, but the fries were good.  This place might be okay for late night dining since I think they're open 24 hours, but I wouldn't come here for dinner again.",

    "text": "It helps to know the right people.  And my friend who lives in Vegas is \"right people.\"  Her Harrah's Diamond player's card allowed us to bypass a long line of hungry tourists and get a better table.  If I had to stand in line at Le Cafe, I would have been very unhappy.  We were seated at a big round table on the \"patio.\"  By \"patio,\" of course, I mean \"the area of the casino floor designated for dining at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis.\"  It makes me laugh every time.  They even call it \"al fresco\" dining on their website.  The cafe facade and the dining room do indeed remind you of old Paris, but the \"patio\" reminds you of that time you forgot to hit soft 17 against the dealer's 8.  That's always a no-no, by the way.  Anyway, I was craving meat, so I ordered a 20 oz. prime rib, medium rare, and a side salad.  The prime rib was around $25, and the side salad - another $3.99.  The steak came with a baked potato, but the waiter was happy to replace the baked potato with some mashed potatoes.  I got some vegetables on the plate, too.  My friend ordered their \"early bird\" special - filet Mignon medallions with pommes frites for only $12.99.  If I hadn't been so hungry and if I had actually liked filet, I would have totally ordered that.  What a deal.  Our entrees arrived 15 minutes later.  Her filet was indeed rare and drenched in sauce.  My prime rib was huge!  I know what a 20 oz prime rib looks like, and that was no 20 oz. steak.  The quality of the meat was definitely above average, but it was slightly overcooked.  It was a good steak, even though it was prepared medium.  I thought about sending it back, but decided against making a scene.  I was having a good time, and the steak was darn good.  The mashed potatoes and the vegetables were pretty dull and lacked flavor, seasoning and salt.  When we were done with our meal, it took us another 15 minutes to flag down our waiter.  He seemed to have gone on a break, and the other waiters had absolutely no interest in helping us.  In fact, they chose to do the easiest thing and just ignore us altogether.  Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis is a cute enough place, and I can even see paying a premium for the location and the faux ambiance.  However, do not expect a 5-star service or a 5-star meal.  Hmm, bad service and overcooked meat--maybe it IS authentic after all . . . :-)",

    "text": "I was in town to play a Video Poker Tournament at Bally's.  After I checked in for registration, I only had about an hour before my time to play.  I was starving and couldn't wait to get some food in me.  Thinking we could probably get a quick bite at the cafe, we proceeded to the diamond desk.  We were seated promptly.    The place was busy but we got our drinks fairly quickly, the waiter got really busy delivering food to other tables.  He finally came by to take our orders and I had to tell him to put in a rush because we hadn't got much time.  He was nice to say 'no problem'.    My fiance ordered a Western Omelet (yeah, he loves omelet), and I ordered a Paris Combination which had 2 pancakes, ham (bone-in), and 2 eggs.  I didn't like my breakfast at all.  The pancakes were not fluffy, the bone-in ham were interesting (with fat and skin still on), and the eggs (over medium) were just eggs, you know.  All these for $40.  I think I get better food at Denny's for about 1/3 of the price!    Paris is supposed to be a 4-star hotel.  I am shocked at the restaurant quality at Paris.  (I also made the mistake of going to Le Villiage Buffet the next day.)  In fact the diamond lounge serves better food than the restaurants.  The only reason I didn't go to diamond lounge was because it was closed at the time.    Paris Hotel Casino is a nice place to visit, but for dinning, this is not the place to be.",

But after my last visit I am not so sure, I had the duck a l'orange.  It tasted okay, I assumed it was just not my type if food.  AsI was eating I starred feeling nauseous.  We ended up just calling for the check and even asked them to pack my girlfriend's desert to go after she had ordered it.  As I walked back to the casino hoping the walking would make me feel better, I started feeling like I was going to vomit, I walked as fast as I could to the room and began to vomit for the next hour.  I called to complain to the restaurant and I was very rudely told we are sorry to bad, here complain to security.  I wasnt looking for anything really other than to maybe bring to attention that this dish might not be good maybe and I was basically brushed of.  Never going there again.  I followed up with guest services and after about 24 hours received an apology, they offered to comp the food to my room, we never saw that credit, and the manager at the time although very polite brushed us off once again, i see no reason to ever return.",

They used to have drink specials and you could get some decent food without going too Vegas on the price.    Now it's just... bad.  The food is average at best.  The Western Omelette was exceptionally plain, with the bell peppers, onions and (overcooked) ham thrown in seemingly at random.  The hash browns seemed like they had been prepared for some time before actually reaching my plate.  The calamari was pretty micro and the other breakfast options weren't much better.  At upwards of $13 a plate, I should've received two of what I ordered given the quality and effort that went into making them.    Equally as bad was the service.  It took almost two hours to get our order taken, receive our food and then get the bill.  Not even the Keno lady was walking around with any sort of regularity so I wasn't sure what the staff here were trying to accomplish other than tempting us to dine and dash.  There are no longer any drink specials for us to drown our sorrows in, so we figured we might as well just go gamble and get 'em for free....",

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.  The food was delicious: calamari appetizer with a lemony/zingy dipping sauce was perfect, and a very large portion.  Main course: I got the Club de St. Louis and it was absolutely wonderful.  Even loved the french fries which I don't normally find very exciting :)  The sandwich was layers of turkey, bacon, sourdough bread, with a tangy mayo-type-dressing and it was really delicious.  Also, it was big enough that I could only eat half and had to take the rest with me (note tho that I did polish off all the fries).  My hubby had the Club au Pollet and he, too, thoroughly enjoyed it.   The only down-note was our server.  It took at least 20 minutes to get water (!!!) so I don't know if he forgot or was busy or whatever, but the rest of it went more smoothly.  He just wasn't friendly at all; no smile, no small-talk, no charm.  And he definitely didn't know any French!  We had to say the English names for the sandwiches for him to know what we wanted - I don't expect him to be fluent but at least know the menu!  He just kind of gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there (which maybe he didn't, but you have to hide that from the customers).   Besides that, we had a lovely dinner.  We may go back simply because the food was so good - and reasonably priced for what you get and for the fact that you are on the Strip and inside the casino!  We'll just be sure to get a different server next time.  :)",

    "text": "I ate here a couple weeks ago and thought the food was pretty great, so I was surprised at all of the negative reviews it got. However, I remembered that I ate here: -At 4am -while absolutely starving -and maybe a bit intoxicated (just a little though, honestly)  So, that might have hindered my perception. However, I'm going to go ahead and review this place anyway. I promise it's not too inaccurate as I ate here with two other friends who ordered the exact same thing I did and we all raved about it afterwards.  Logistics/Price: It's open 24/7, which is its best advantage. It is also conveniently located about 40 feet from the hotel elevators leading up to the rooms, so if you're already staying in Paris, this is a good place to satisfy some late-night/early morning cravings. The prices during the day are kind of expensive for only average-tasting food, but its late night menu is not bad and sometimes they have certain $8 specials that could be worth it (check the menu right outside the restaurant to see). They also have a random Chinese menu as well filled with basic Americanized Chinese fare (chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken, etc) that ends at 3am but I wouldn't recommend that unless you're really desperate.  Ambience: The cafe is an interesting one right in the Paris hotel. It is not in an actual building at all (no roofs or walls) but is instead in a patio-like area in the corner of the casino, seated in front of the hotel's backdrop of buildings made to look like the quaint establishments in Paris. It literally just looks like someone decided to section off a small corner of the casino and set up some tables and chairs. Despite this however, it doesn't actually look that bad, and is kind of an interesting set up - great for people-watching.   Service: From the one time I've been here, I had great service, though  it was at 4am. We were seated immediately and our waitress was helpful, very nice and extremely prompt. We got our food within 15 minutes.   Food: I ate here with 2 other guys and we all decided to order the French Dip - a roast beef sandwich on French baguettes served with Au Jus for about $8-12 (I can't recall the actual price at the moment, but am positive it was in that range). All three of us thought it was delicious. The roast beef was tender and flavorful and the Au Jus was steaming hot and served in a huge bowl - very generous amount. The bread was great, not too hard or chewy, and did not overpower the roast beef. I don't believe there was much else in the actual sandwich though - just roast beef and melted cheese, but from what I recall it was great as is. I actually didn't finish mine and took half of it to go, which I ate the next morning at 5pm and it was still very good (and unrefrigerated too).  My friend also ordered a Creme Brulee for about $7 and I thought it was fantastic. It was just the right amount of sweetness and felt like it melted in my mouth. Once again though, please keep in mind this was at 4 in the morning while exhausted and starving.  Verdict: A good place for very, very late-night meals - decent food at decent prices. However, only eat here IF you are either already at the hotel, are staying at the hotel, or are desperate for extremely late night food and are already close by. This is not a place to go out of your way to get to (even if out of your way means walking 600 feet up the strip). .",

    "text": "Let me start with if I could give NO stars I would. This has to be the WORST!!! meal I have ever had in Vegas. The WORST service I have ever had in Vegas. First off If you like to order drinks you have to wait for your server not the person who brings you your water but your server. That will take about 20 minutes. Then even if your ready to order your server disappears. They were not that busy either. As a person who works in the industry this was awful. Anyways we finally order the beef dip sandwich. Suppose to be sirloin french dip. Well they must have taken all the left over fat meat and stuck it in my sandwich. My boyfriends was no better. I ended up eating only the potato salad because my sandwich was nothing but fat. while eating my boyfriend was hoping to receive a refill on his water. Well fat chance on that one. everyone just kept walking past him and paid no attention. So finally I stood up grabed the water jug from the server station a mere 2 feet away and filled his water for him. If your hungry and want to eat in the beautiful Paris casino wait in line for the buffet or eat at the burger place, because this place flat out sucks!",

The prices are slightly on the expensive side but seem on par for Las Vegas. However, the food quality and portions are completely worth it. The Vanilla Bean French Toast is amazing! The omelette was delicious (my only complaint is that the menu said roasted tomatoes and I got something more resembling canned diced tomatoes.). The mocha cafe was equally delicious. The atmosphere was the inside of Paris so nothing to really say there. Service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely eat there again and I would recommend it.",

As we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess with a smile.  But once we were sorted, it became a whole different story.    Where should I begin.  Once we sat on our table, we were waiting on a server to bring us water.  We waited for 15 minutes and no server would come to our table. The people around that came in after us were sited and served, but not our section (exterior). I had to walk up to a server and request them to bring us water. Shortly after, a male waiter passed by our table. I asked him if he could take our order due to no waiter coming to our table. He advised us that he wasn't our waiter and that they will be coming shortly. After that, he left. Now this was extremely rude.   We got up, walked towards the entrance of the restaurant and spoke with Coleen (restaurant manager). She was one of the nicest person I met on this trip.  She was apologetic even though it was not her fault. She directed us to the buffet next door and advised us that it was amazing.   Overall experience was a negative one. I would have given it one star if it wasn't for the hostess and the manager.",

The cafe has seating that lets you have a complete view of the casino, so people watching is a must. The menu does not have that many French options besides crepes; they have mostly steak and eggs, omelette dishes, etc.  I had the eggs benedict ($17), which came with canadian bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned, but could have been crispier. I'm not a huge fan of hollandaise sauce (all that butter, no thank you), so I wasn't pleased when my eggs were drowned in it. I loved how the English muffin tasted more like a biscuit, since it was dense and savory. Portions were really good and everyone was stuffed after leaving. We also shared a croissant, which wasn't anything special in my opinion and not worth $6.  I didn't notice that my food was cold or that service was slow. The line to get in at 10 AM was about a ten minute wait. Price is a bit expensive, so if you wanted to eat at Paris, I would recommend the creperie.",

The service took forever, the vegetables on her omelette were barely cooked, no one came to check on us to see if our food was okay, and the check took forever to get.

My wife and I both ordered the 49.00 special which comes with a starter, main dish, two sides, choice of dessert, and one glass of wine.  First, you receive the bread, bread was hard as a rock and not even warm enough to melt the cold butter, so we didn't eat but one bite. We both got the French onion soup, ribeye, and Mac & cheese side. Although, she got creamed spinach for the second side and the chocolate layer cake for dessert, where I got saute mushrooms with onions for my second side and cheesecake for my dessert.  First, they serve your wine in this cheesy small glass, so the wine can't be swirled to release the aroma. Turns out that maybe because the wine was mediocre at best.  The soup was good, but that's where it ended. The salt on the steak was overwhelming so much so my wife only ate 4 or 5 bites leaving over 80% of the steak. Mac & cheese was dry but decent flavor. Cream spinach was more cream than spinach. Oh, and the mushrooms had the same problem as the steak, over salted. The cheesecake was dry, Chocolate layered cake was not moist and outside frosting kind of rubbery, even Costco makes a better chocolate layered cake. When the waitress noticed so much food not eaten she asked us if we wanted a to-go container, we both instantly simultaneously said \"NO\".  Not to French standard, not even close. Would not ever return.",

    "text": "On my last night of the staycation, we dined here. We were staying at Ballys, which is attached to Paris. Lately, Ballys cafe closes at 2 PM, making Le Cafe the cafe of Ballys and Paris.  The wait to be seated was not the fastest, the selection was not the best, and the prices are high. But what else is new in the world of Strip cafes ?   Just like the Paris Hotel and Casino, I add a star for a well done job on the theme. In my case, the Paris theme helps create a disbelief from reality. The attention to the Paris theme, kind of made me feel like I was dining in a Paris cafe. If this was an ordinary looking cafe, then I'd be turned off by the wait to be seated and limited menu.    As far as table service, no problems. Oscar was a  professional and attentive waiter.    The steak special was decent. Just like the buffet in Paris, the potatoes are superb. I would of appreciated more potatoes than green beans with a fairer portion of steak.    An interesting observation is that the prices here are similar to the far less fancy cafes. Including the Flamingo Cafe.  If you are up to getting a good cafe meal at a decent price, I recommend an off Strip casino such as the Orleans. If you want decent food at inflated prices in a well-done Paris themed cafe, I recommend Le Cafe.",

We heard from someone in line and our server that it was some of the best French toast around..it was pretty tasty but I've had better. They did have a decent amount of vegetarian options! My dad ordered the corned beef hash with over easy eggs and sour dough toast. He asked for a side of the fingerling potatoes too. Those were good!!",

The food at this place is always satisfying, and it is easy for your friends to find you when you sit in their little \"courtyard.\"  The prices are not over the top either, which is nice.   The problem I have?  Service.  When my coworkers and I gather for breakfast, we constantly run out of coffee, and our waters sit empty.  This may not be a huge deal, but if you were up playing the tables, and you know you have a full day of work coming up, coffee is crucial, as is water.  It seems this problem carries over, as I went for lunch last time, and drinks also sat empty, and the process of getting a check was excruciating.    I would like to give a higher rating, I really would, because I enjoy your food, and you offer something for whatever mood I am in.  I cannot, however, bring myself to not take service into account.",

Everyone was just looking at each other asking each other where the waitress was (I could hear them talk due to our proximity). And any night is probably like a weekend night in Vegas but it was Wednesday night.  I stopped in for dessert and ordered the creme brulee based on the waitress' suggestion. I couldn't finish half of it. Something was just off with the custard. My dining friend had a tuna sandwich that had an actual thick cut of tuna. She didn't rave about it but said it was definitely passable.   We quickly ate and left.  The restaurant itself is cute because it looks out onto the casino rather than an enclosed space so it did feel like we were out on a French cafe, which is what everything here is like.",

    "text": "Overall rating is 1.5 stars out of 5.  When my wife and arrived at our hotel in Vegas on 05/16/13 we were quite hungry and ready for lunch. After a brief discussion we decided, we would get our bags situated in our room first and then head to this restaurant mainly because of it's proximity and because our stomachs talking to us lol.   When we arrived at the entrance we were immediately greeted by the hostess and quickly escorted to our seats (So far so good). Now here is where it starts to go down hill (Just a mental reminder that this place was not busy at all during this time).  Ok so my wife and I sat at the table for well over 20 minutes before a guy finally arrived and asked us our drink orders. We quickly told him what we wantef to drink because by this time we already knew what we wanted for lunch. When I proceeded to tell him what we wanted to order he said, \"Your server will be with you shortly\" (Well that was a bold face lie). After about 5 minutes the guy brings out our drinks and some bread with butter for us to eat.  This bread was awful and its not so much because of taste but more so because the outer part of the bread was hard like rocks. So we thought we could bypass that by eating the soft inside which we found out was not even room temperature this bread was cold. So we ended not eating the bread. I say about another 20-25 minutes later our server arrives to take our order (FINALLY!).  After finally placing our order (The Paris Burger w/ Fries) that took another 15-20 minutes to finally get delivered to our table. The good thing is that when the food finally came it was pretty good. The fries were pretty good and I like how the top bum of the burger was cooked. The edge of the buns had a crispy texture while the rest of the bun still remained sofT.   Overall the burger was not life changing but still a decent burger and the fries were good as well. In the end the reason for the low rating is because service was extremely SLOW and the bread was not good at all either (Some people might like that but not me).  The sad thing is that this place seems to be packed with people later in the evening however because of this experience I do not think I'll be coming back to this until maybe my next trip to Vegas. There are just too many restaurants and places to explore to be fixated on this one.  Maybe next time Le Cafe. Hey maybe you guys might have better look with service.  Good Luck.",

While I'm not a big fan of soup, the French Onion was delicious. The Prime Rib was perfection, although I only managed to finish about half since I ate the soup so fast The Chocolate layer cake was about as big as two \"regular\" slices at a \"regular\" restaurant and was moist and chocolatey!

    "text": "Pathetic.  That pretty much sums it up right there.  Sometimes, you can make an argument that the place at least tried to make decent food, but I don't think you can in this case.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprise if I'm putting in more effort to write this than it took for them to make my food - it was that bad.    After partying at XS, I ended up coming here with some of my friends since they were staying at Paris.  Given that it was 4:30 in the morning, we were a bit too tired to stray too far, so this was convenient enough since it was right by the elevator to their rooms.  We grabbed a table amongst a dozen or so other guests, and quickly put in our order (btw, amazing how many old people are awake and gambling at that hour...makes me wonder if they didn't sleep, or just woke up).  As the food came out, we were just about starving.  Or at least, I was.  Since I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy, decided to order a bowl of clam chowder and the potato skins appetizer to share with the table.  When the waiter started to bring our food out, I could already tell something was amiss.  Everyone else's food looked fine, and the clam chowder looked like what I expected (mediocre), but the potato skins didn't look appetizing at all.  The cheese was scarce, the potatoes still looked raw, and there was barely any topping/meat at all.  It was edible, but so bland!  And once I ate a bite of the soup, that fact only became even more apparent.  Now, whoever prepared those potatoes is probably not the one that made the clam chowder because blandness is not the issue.  Instead, it's SALT.  While most places will season to taste with salt, these guys must have a GIANT cube of salt in the pot, and add chowder to taste instead.  Seriously, you can't taste anything else, whether it be the chowder or the clams.  It was so bad, I really - I had a handful of sips and just had to stop.  They might as well call it hypertension chowder.  My friends seemed to think their food was okay, but most drank more than I did so I don't really know if they actually liked it or not.  Good for this place being open 24 hours, but with so many other choices out there, you should do all that you can to go somewhere else regardless of the time.  Even if you're drunk off your ass and staying here, go upstairs and get room service...it'll taste better (since it can't be any worse) and you won't even have to leave your room.  Honestly, you're better off going to Denny's...A LOT better off.",

Here's what we had:  - Steak frites: Dry and small. All the French fries we ordered (came with the burgers and the steak frites were overcooked like they had been frozen and deep-fried) - American burger: Nothing to report, no special dressing, nothing worth getting again -- we only got this at the behest of my cousin. - Parisian burger: Better flavor, since there was brie and pear, but not great. Again, no sauce! - Salmon: This was actually good, but the portion was insanely small. Very buttery and moist.  - Caesar salad: A bit too salty, but I like the anchovy on the salad - Roasted half chicken: Super dry and tasteless.   The food sucked, and that breaks my heart, because I used to eat here all the time with my parents 10 years ago when they took my brother and me to Las Vegas. The food I remember was tasty! Even my parents liked it.   Service blew. Our server took our order impatiently and didn't check on us. At one point, we wanted to order more food, but after 20 minutes, and asking someone else to find our server twice, we were already done with our meal and didn't want anything else by the time he deigned to show up!   Also, one of my pet peeves is French grammatical errors at a place that is representing itself to be French. Their 3-course menu is called \"Le American\" -- sigh.   Anyway, if you have to eat here, ask to sit \"outside.\" It's much cuter than the sad inside.",

He then took entirely too long to bring us a couple glasses of water, and when I went to take a sip I had the most unpleasant experience of feeling something swimming inside my mouth. I spit it back out and discovered that it was bits of lemon that were littering the water in the glass.  Both glasses were filthy full of the stuff.  I was ready to leave but it was impossible to tell someone to not bother bringing me my Heineken. When our missing server came back, I told him to cancel it because we were leaving.

    "text": "YUCK!  Don't come here for breakfast - the toast is dry, the hash is cold, the pancakes are flapjacks and the eggs taste like powder.  The strawberry waffles are ok...if you eat around the soggy parts.  Especially come here if you want to get charged, TWICE on your credit/atm card.  The waiters are just as stupid.  Waiter #1 says you can have the dinner option before dinner time.  Waiter #2 comes back and says, no, no dinner option available.  You tell the waiter how you want your food and it comes back wrong.  You say you want a coke, they come back with a soda that is not a coke without disclosing.  Your meal is not just wrong, but super salty, tasteless and makes Zimmern's food look appealing.  YUM.",

    "text": "an easy lunch of Eggs Benedict and a BLT took an hour?  WTF?  first off - it took 15 minutes for someone to take our order.  then it took another 20 minutes to get the food   we were hungry. scratch that - at this point, we were ravenous.  my friend wolfed her benedict - which looked seriously underwhelming from across the table... the only little flair was the dash of paprika over the holondaise blanket.  the BLT was rather sad... the lettuce was limp - the tomatoes were mealy. at least they didn't mess up the sourdough & bacon.   i only ate half and wanted a box for the second half which again took forever to get...   the cole-slaw was disgusting - i used to HATE cole slaw - but i've had good ones lately... so i dropped my guard... this slaw reminded me why i used to hate cole slaw.  it took us 5 minutes to finish eating our meals.   we were waiting another 10 minutes for anyone to ask how we were doing or even notice we were done & waiting... for the bill (and a box)  the only thing prompt about the service was when the server was returning us our change after we paid the bill.    Yes - the service in the real Paris is slow - but at least the food and ambiance is great where ever you go (for the most part).",

    "text": "Standard American greasy spoon fare. The French name is misleading. I had a decent French onion soup (though a little heavy on the onions) and the Alley Salad (romaine lettuce, garbanzo beans, salami, chicken, cheese, cucumber). My friends had breakfast food - eggs benedict, pancakes, eggs and sausage. I tried a bite of pancake and it was a little dry.   The prices are a little bit higher than the average diner joint, typical of the Vegas Strip, but not outrageous.   Being a group of Asians, we were also offered an Asian menu that included items such as congee, udon, etc. I didn't try any of these dishes but it was interesting to see how accommodating Vegas has become towards its many, many Asian visitors.",

    "text": "We were lucky to snag a table before the lunch rush came in just a little after noon last Saturday.  Le Parisien - Baguette, Ham, Cheese, and mustard.  Simple, no?  No.    The baguette's texture was hard and too thick for its own sake.  Paris, France (as in the city-comma-country that I visited last Summer) on the other hand, had a tough texture too and I could chew it and not be afraid of damaging my teeth.  As for the flavors, Le Cafe Ile St Louis was definitely Americanized since it was loaded with meat.  Good value for my meal, but for about the same price in Euro, the smaller ham and cheese baguette sandwiches I got in Paris, France (from several gas stations no less!) had less meat and more flavors in it that burst out allowing me to taste all the ingredients combined in all its glorious simplicity as if I were to eat it for the first time.  Value schmalue.  Good taste always trumps price in my book.  Like Pepe Le Pew feens for the white paint striped lady cat, I'm feenin' for a real ham and cheese baguette sammich.  Le French fries were thin, crispy and oh so tasty.    Don't even get me started on le service.  They weren't attentive but seemed glad to serve us.  My water was filled but once.  Our server went missing and it took maybe 5 minutes longer than usual to get our food.  She forgot my French Chicken Noodle Soup.  She even wrote it down!!!  At least le service is French-like.",

The silver lining of this story is that service is so slow we over-successfully managed to waste our time.  When our party of 4 arrived, there was no line and the place looked deserted.  The hostess told us she'd check for a table and disappeared for several minutes before leading us through a 97% empty restaurant to a table on the opposite side.  Our waiter was over-friendly in a creepy and definitely trip-grubbing way.  The food was terrible.  I ordered a $13 cheesesteak sandwich which came out late, cold, dry, and tasteless, with a side of soggy fries.  Very disappointing.",

    "text": "We had an evening flight into Vegas on Christmas Eve.  Since we were staying in Paris and we were hungry for a quick meal,we decided to go to Le Cafe Ille Saint Louis. We didn't have a long wait since we have our Total Rewards Silver cards.  We were seated inside the restaurant facing the \"outdoors\" patio.  We waited and waited for a server to come and get our drink orders.  Hubby is particular about ordering.  He likes to sip his drink while he looks over the menu.  As usual, he asked for a couple of minutes to make up his mind when the drinks arrived.  The server gave him the nastiest look!  She stormed off and returned a few minutes later.  I ordered the onion soup and the Croque Monsieur.  Hubby ordered a Ceasar Salad with shrimp.  The soup came and it was quite good (the only reason this place gets a star!).  Luckily, I shared it with hubby, who had to wait ages before our entrees came.   My Croque Monsieur was soaked in butter.  I took a couple of bites and couldn't go on.  Hubby's salad was actually decent and he enjoyed it.   Overall, a horrible experience and one I don't plan to repeat.  The food at its best is mediocre.  The service unbelievably horrible.  The family next to us (and had been seated before us) were still waiting to order while we had already been served my soup.  Eventually, our server took their order but by the time we finished our dinner, their food still hadn't arrived.  Realizing that they were French and spoke very little English, hubby intervened on their behalf with the manager.  The last we saw of the manager, he was looking for someone who spoke French.  Hope they got their dinner!",

The bread was real good. Breakfast was yummy too. The eggs and hashbrowns were made well. My husband got the steak and eggs meal. They made it nice and juicy.   Although, this place is really expensive for breakfast. For the price, you think you'd get \"knock your socks off\" type of food. Orange juice was $4.00, AND our waiter didn't even come back to see if my husband wanted more. Which leads me to believe that there's no free refills on that.   I guess you can say it's okay if you don't mind spending that much on your breakfast. In Vegas though, you could probably find better for a cheaper price.",

We joked the next day that they were probably still sitting there waiting for their food.  I ordered the clam chowder. It was a decent-sized bowl of soup, but really salty.

The wait was short, good point... but our waiter took 20 minutes to come ask what we wanted.  Then we saw the eggs benedict at the table next to us.  We looked at each other at the same time: the english muffin were totally burned!  Shortly after the owner of the plate asked for more hollandaise sauce as there was barely any.  Then came my espresso... well that's what I had ordered.  I got some instantaneous coffee instead.  I asked if the machine was broken and they said no.  I then asked to get it exchanged for a regular coffee.  It was as bad but at least I didn't have to pay the $5.50 for my double-espresso.  Then much later came our greasy toast with fake butter and the rest of the order.  If you go there for a french experience, just forget about it.  This place should be avoided at any price.  As a nice alternative, go get your croissants and pains au chocolat next door at Lenotre which is a nice patisserie with nice coffee and pastries.  Enjoy your trip in Vegas!  P",

We ordered drinks and it took forever to get them. Also some friends ordered other drinks that they never received and thankfully were not charged for. Our waitress was nice but obviously overwhelmed with how busy it was in her section as we were never checked up on. I ordered a blue cheeseburger and it was delicious.   There are better places to go while in Las Vegas. While this was not horrible it was far from great.",

    "text": "For what it is (cheap cafe place that's open 24 hours in a Strip casino) it wasn't bad at all.  Came here with my pops around 11pm for some late night grub.  Typical adjacent position next to the gaming area, with a patio in front \"open\" from the rest of the restaurant.  Dad had the club sandwich, I had the stuffed potato skins and we shared an order of the wings (sauce on the side).  The potato skins were decent enough, nice sized potato, melted cheese, bacon bits, sour cream side...  your average potato skin appetizer.  I had a layer of my dad's club and it was tasty - fresh bread, not mayo'd down, nice bacon slices, hearty turkey pieces (not sliced).  The wings however, were pretty damned good - you could tell they weren't frozen prior.  With the sauce on the side, has a fried crust that made them taste like bite sized pieces of fried chicken.  Not bad.  All in all it served its purpose.  You're never going to get a grand culinary experience from a place like this, just a seat and a table and hopefully a satisfied stomach.  It's the Vegas version of the roadside cafe...  sit down, eat, and carry on your way.  I've been to Vegas enough times to be thoroughly disappointed by places like this, but this was not one of those times.",

    "text": "I am surprised by the binary \"love it\" or \"hate it\" trend in Yelp reviews for this place.  Here are the important facts:  1)  This place is not particularly \"French,\" despite the name and location.  Basically, this is a traditional American restaurant. 2)  The food is functional, but unlikely to inspire awe.   3)  The physical environment is pleasant, though a trifle silly.  The Paris hotel/casino creates an internal design motif of a pretend French city street, with fake trees and shrubs, and a fake sky painted on the ceiling.  Hence, Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis has an \"inside\" seating area, and an \"outside\" seating area, under the fake sky, where one can people watch those passing in the \"street.\"  Be advised, however, that at night a band starts up at another venue down the \"street,\" and the noise carries over to the St.Louis, making conversation more difficult. 4)  One of the consistent gripes in the Yelp reviews is slow service.  Our waitress, Ofelia, was the opposite -- exceedingly speedy, frequently checking on us, friendly, happy, cheerful to accede to any request.  For our dinner, I ordered the $39 pre-fixe menu, opting for the tomato salad, the filet mignon, and the cheesecake.  The serving sizes in the pre-fixe menu are markedly smaller than their a la carte counterparts.  As at least one other remarked, the tomato salad is literally 3 small slices of tomato (2 red, 1 yellow) with some clover-like greens on them.  Tasty, but tiny.  The filet was less than half the size of the filet that came with my date's steak au poive; furthermore the medium and medium rare cooking temperatures we had requested for each were both underdone.  Both steaks were a bit fattier than is ideal, and the flavor was good but not great.    The exception to the \"smaller\" rule came at desert - our slice of cheesecake was so huge that the two of us could barely finish half of it.    So, who should eat at Cafe Ile St. Louis?  Someone who knows they are not getting anything special, who wants a basic meal for a slightly elevated price, at a location that is conveniently nearby.  Don't expect to love it, nor to hate it.",

First of all the decor is pretty dated and old! They sat us inside and it was a pretty bleak ambiance. We passed 8 open tables but of course they seat us between two tables already eating so we had to squeeze in without bumping into everyone. But once we sat down the customer service and the food was AMAZING. All the waiters helped with refills, they were polite and attentive, and our sandwiches were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>! I had the Turkey club which was delicious and stacked high! Bacon pieces were thick and crispy, and my friend's BLT was just as good. The fun surprise was their fries! They were seasoned with garlic and parsley and came in a large portion. And once we got the check, our total was only $35! That was the cheapest meal in the history of Las Vegas.",

She finally brought the side dish when she brought the check and made her pay for it, even though it was too cold to even eat at that point.   When our table asked if we could get our checks because of trying to make a shuttle back to the airport, Patsy ran off without saying a word. When she returned to the table after another 15 minutes, she had realized that she had messed up the bill. Rather than apologizing, she said, \"I gotta hurry it's my break time!\" After another 10 minutes she threw the bills on the table and ran off.

The others in my party had the cobb salad, very nice presentation and they said it was very good.   Pricing is not bad. Service was not the best. the location is very nice, felt like we were outside, but didn't have the endure the 100+ temps outside!",

Then we sit down, order beignets and French onion soup.  The waiter comes back a few minutes later to say that they don't have beignets after all.  The French onion soup was also extremely salty.  I could not eat it.  There are plenty of French cafes on the Strip.  Seek one elsewhere.",

We were seated immediately and were greeted by our amazing server. We ordered our wine and he showed us the special (a 3 course meal for $39).   I ended up with the filet au poivre and the boy had the special (filet mignon, wedge salad, 2 sides and dessert). We were both very pleased with our meals, the steaks were cooked perfectly and the sides were pitch-perfect. This would be a solid 3 star joint in just about any city... what bumps this one up to a 4 star was our server. He was beyond amazing, he was attentive without being overbearing, he knew the menu and he brought out things without even being asked. It was a lovely way to start our evening.",

Our server Duke was very professional and friendly. The rest of the staff needs training. The hostesses were yelling at each other across the dinning room in Spanish. My guests and the table across from me looked up because of the level of voices thinking some fight was breaking out but there weren't arguing they were just joking about an experience. I can understand them and it was just was a conversation in poor taste for a dining experience. Not a big deal but not very pleasing to the ears. Then when our delicious food was served a staff member came to clean the floor with a bucket of bleach. Wonderful! My food just arrived after 20 mins and is followed by the aroma of bleach rendering it flavorless. I asked him to leave my area, nicely, and he told me there's nothing bad in the water. I mean it's bleach, please leave. If it's bothering a customer don't dispute them. This place would have better reviews if the staff didn't behave like they were working at McDonald's.",

The crepes tasted flat, tough and just not good. The person who ordered pancakes for the last slice from the stack was obviously burnt as black. None of us finished our plates. I was pretty hungry and for food to not taste good on an empty stomach says something. Even hot tea tasted old and unclean.

This is one of those understated menus that gives no clue as to how delicious things would be. So I chose my own omelette ingredients and was delighted to find that it was a freshly created masterpiece with made with the best ingredients. It was lovely.  However this review is done simply so I could rave about the English muffin. This was this meal that forced me to confront that fact that I have never truly had an english muffin before.  For us all, It's merely the base to an eggs Benedict, a dry toasted necessity; an afterthought. However, This was different. This was apparently what they're supposed to taste like. This was freshly made, buttery and light. When I bit into it, I didn't feel like I was chewing down on dusty air pockets but pillowy clouds of joy. I can now honestly say I've never had a True English muffin before. English muffins are never anyone's first choice but at this place it should be.",

We stood in line for 15 minutes and then walked in to find the place filled with empty tables. About a dozen waiters and waitresses walking around \"serving\" customers. I work in the food industry and I know a good service when I see one.  We sat down and not for another 15-20 minutes that the busboy came by and rudely asked us what do we like to drink. Anyway. That's done. We got our coffee and now the wait again. A good while before the server came to take the order. The food came out pretty fast but not as I expected it to be.  I got the corn beef hash wish was very dry and the poached eggs, well weren't poached. More like a hard boiled eggs. No my the runny yolk that you expect. They serve it to you with a side of ketchup I guess to wash down the dry beef.  My girlfriend got the scrambled eggs with sage sausage and some grilled vegetables. Overall the food was very mediocre. Cold. And unpleasant. Oh and that was the last I saw of the server. I had to go looking for him to pay my bill. Would I ever come again. No I wouldn't. EVER!  You're probably better off at the cafe across the way where I actually enjoyed my coffee and my delicious croissant the day before.

If I was a tourist with time for only breakfast I'd definitely pass on this and go to Mon Ami Gabi instead.   We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, but there was a line so it was organized. Once inside we noticed that the restaurant was half empty. It appeared during our meal that they were short on servers so they must have been spacing the seatings.   The breakfast menu isn't that large and I finally settled on the Ham & Cheese Croissant. My husband had the Sausage Biscuit and we shared a Strawberry Crepe. The strawberry crepe had a nice flavor, but was a little overloaded with the filling. The size of the crepe was also not great for the price. My husband's Sausage Biscuit was really good, the highlight being the apple butter on the side. The Ham & Cheese Biscuit was okay, but not overly great. It took me until I was almost finished to realize why - the fried egg that was to be included was absent. I was almost finished eating it at that point so it seemed silly to even say anything. The potatoes on the side were boring and lacked any flavor.  Our waiter was nice, but obviously stretched thin. He did take good care of us and did apologize for the delays in service.",

    "text": "I only ate here because I was given a voucher to use on dining for my stay here. The voucher was redeemable at several restaurants, I chose to eat here because I always passed by it since it is near the elevators. Anyone staying at this hotel would not miss seeing this cafe.   I came here for breakfast, the menu had the usual eggs benedict, crepes, pancakes, etc.   Service: SLOW. Although they seated us immediately upon entering, our server did not come until 10minutes later. What is the point of seating guests if no servers are available to serve? It was such a long wait, me and my friend already knew what we wanted to order, but nobody came to take our orders or offer water. The server finally came 10minutes later and made recommendations on what was good.  Food: I ordered the savoury crepe, and my friend got the banana pancakes. The crepe was filled with cheese, and it was decent. The banana pancakes had a strong banana flavor and it was very fluffy. I prefer the pancakes more.   Overall the food is decent so if you have the food voucher for staying at the hotel, I think this is a decent place to redeem the voucher. However, don't expect quality service.",

    "text": "This place was so terrible I literally downloaded yelp so I could make this review. Me and my friends wanted to eat in \"Paris\" so badly and saw that the cafe was relatively empty and in a good location so we assumed it would be fast. It took 8 minutes for someone to come over and talk to us and ask if we wanted coffee or tea, and another 5 for us to even get water. After we got our water we asked a host if we could see our server who we still hadn't seen. It had started taking so long we started timing it just to see how bad it could get. Another 14 minutes after we got water the server came up for the first time to the table, didn't apologize or say anything about the menu and just started taking orders. My friend clarified afterwards what her order was, and the entire thing was completely wrong. When the drinks finally came out another 10 minutes later, my sister received the wrong drink and when we told our waiter, he didn't say anything, rolled his eyes quite visibly, and it took another 10 minutes for her to receive her correct drink (a Bellini by the way). It took 35 minutes from when we ordered to get our food after we already had complained to a manager, who said he would come check on us before the bill arrived, and we never saw him again. The food was not good and within our entire party of 9 no one even ate half of it. I ordered Cesar and chicken noodle soup and the soup tasted worse than any canned soup I've ever had. No one checked on the food at all, not even our server.   All of my party are servers and we are aware that we can't blame every issue on each individual, but I have never seen worse service in my entire life. The staff was inattentive and did not apologize for any mistake. When the bill was brought out we asked to see the same manager but he was nowhere to be found, and another manager had to be grabbed. So many things had gone wrong he just comped our entire bill, which was incredibly nice and we were thankful, but disappointed that had to be the case. I hope the service and food improves because it's an amazing little spot and a great atmosphere.",

The french onion soup had lots of onion flavor and some salt too.  The french dip was piled too high with meat in a sandwich roll which was not meant for dipping.  Its supposed to be dipped so either provide a big boat to be able to dip it our provide a sandwich size that fits the dipping bowl.  Fries were a bit soggy.  Beet and goat cheese salads were good; though the presentation was lacking and we needed more dressing on the greens as the few drizzles just didn't cut it.",

We waited 20 minutes for a seat (no big deal) and were seated at a table in the corner by the loud and smelly casino. This is when it got bad...We waited over 40 minutes for our server to show up. We finally mentioned something to the manager and after that we had Alex show up at our table with a huge chip on his shoulder. We ordered and then sat there for another 50 minutes. We again mentioned our concern and at this time Alex brought us our food with a huff. Never did he refill our glasses, ask if everything was OK - nothing. We had to flag him down each time and the final straw was the fit he threw over us asking for 'to go' boxes. On leaving - I sought out the manager for the 3rd time and let him know what a horrible server Alex was and about the attitude we received from him. He told me that Alex was their \"Employee of the Month\"!! If that is what they consider noteworthy - I will never dine there again.  Food is overpriced and nothing spectacular. Service is horrible!!",

The food was mediocre at best, and after having dined in Le Village Buffet next door I'm certain they share the same kitchen. This means you're paying more for your single serving breakfast that you would be paying the $15 for the buffet. I suppose if you really wanted to avoid the lines at the buffet and didn't mind shelling out for each glass of juice you wanted this would be alright. We'd dined at the buffet on Saturday morning and felt the lines (that really weren't that bad) would be worth waiting on rather than pay a premium for the same food.",

They sure didn't have enough waiters. Once we were seated, the service was very slow. 3. Food came slow. They had to give us bread to keep us entertained. But the french rolls were stale and hard. I could have knocked someone out with those things. 4. Finally got my chicken sandwich. They left the buns open, which was good, so I was able to see the chicken breast inside. The chicken was burned and small. It tasted bitter (from the burn) and dull. So I tried other stuff that came with the sandwich. That one slice of tomato wasn't bad. Lettuce tasted bitter too. Pickle was edible. Buns were just boring buns. I was so starving (having late dinner and long wait) at that time, I decided to just eat everything that was edible - tomato and pickle. At the end, the busboy came over and took my plate, without asking me whether I was done or about the food even though I left all the main ingrediants on the place. Of course, they charged me the full price for my dish, which was already expensive compared to a normal cafe. What a rip off! And it totally ruined my night. My stomach was left cold and empty. And I was angry.  Conclusion: bad service, bad food quality, bad cooking skills",

    "text": "We tried to eat here. I don't know why Paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3,000 room resort after midnight on New Years. On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line. After a second group left and told us the same thing (food taking forever to come), we too decided to leave. We waited a hour in line for nothing, although I guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino. Horrible planning on Paris' part.",

We arrived at 7:15 a.m. and were seated right away (you'd hope so).  Our waiter Philip was very friendly and inviting.   My husband had an omelet and potatoes, which he wasn't overly thrilled with.  I had the quiche which turned out to be really good!  The quiche had a nice, flaky pastry crust filled with lightly whipped eggs, mushrooms, ham and cheese.  The breakfast potatoes were just alright.  I think I'd try the roasted fingerling potatoes next time. Service was very friendly and quick, food was good. Worth a stop in for breakfast.",

The only saving graces here to have this be three stars and not one, are that the strawberry crepes were pretty great and this place isn't extremely expensive. I'm sure there are better options in the Paris Hotel if you look.",

    "text": "I think it's sad that I'm writing a one star review about a restaurant on the strip. I don't write these often, but this just goes to show the level of frustaration I had during our visit here. I honestly had high hopes just because of the layout and facade of the restaurant, and I personally love cafes that are \"outdoor\".  Food: Food was mediocre. As far the variety on the menu, there wasn't much. We were there clearly for breakfast, but by the time our waitress Elvia came to our table, we asked if we could also see a lunch menu. There were five of us in our party so some of us ordered and shared our meals. I had the Corned Beef Hash, which wasn't bad, but I felt like the food was on the colder side. Our other companions also mentioned their fries were cold. My other friend who ordered the Foie Gras Burger said he wasn't too happy with his burger patty and his fries were also cold.   Environment/Ambiance: The cafe really added to the Paris theme of the hotel. There was a lot of seating indoor and even in the outdoor aspect part of the cafe. We requested there to be seated outdoors. Because the restaurant is part of the casino floor, it tends to be on the louder side. What made it even louder was that they were playing the World Cup on various televisions around the casino, including the restaurant.   Service: For a restaurant on the strip, I expected better. When we were seated we waited a long time for someone to even offer us drinks. We noticed that although our table of five was in the middle of the outdoor seating area, no one could figure out who was waiting our table. We saw numerous times when the servers, hostess, and what looked like the manager kept talking about our table. We watched as other smaller tables were seated and attended to quickly. I was particularly hungry this day and I was not in the mood to be ignored especially when there were so many people around us enjoying their dining experience. It almost came to the point where we were looking for a manager to complain to. To our dismay, most of the workers around us were staring at the television to watch the game. I was particularly annoyed at the fact that we still had not been even asked about our drinks. One of the hostesses came out and apologized and said our server was coming out shortly...which was completely incorrect. By the time our server arrived, she seemed way too distracted to even welcome us to the restaurant. I was appalled when she came to the table and said \"Hello, I'll be your server today\" and then immediately walked away from the table to start collecting checks. Things like this happened with this particular server a few times. By the time our food was eventually served, another waitress took over our table. We had no idea that they switched servers on us. I'm not sure when this took place, but it may have had something to do with our food being pretty cold. I don't know if someone forgot to run our food, but at this point I was already very unhappy with our overall experience.  Tips: I honestly have nothing good to say about this dining experience. Sure, this was a restaurant on the strip, and it looks like a good place to dine, but the service aspect really killed it. I'm pretty sure I won't be dining here ever again.",

There were few diners in the restaurant.  The ambience was ... hrm. I'm at a loss for words. We opted to dine outside. The interior was too dreary and lonesome. Outside consisted of small tables underneath a faux Parisian sky, surrounded by casino go-ers. A small gate separated us from the hordes of casino-folks.  The service needs improvement. Our waiter was impatient. He tried to be polite (point! thank you!) but his mannerisms implored discomfort.   The food failed to be spectacular. There were two special dinner options, and we each got one. Variety to taste everything, right? My chicken was a dry and boyfriend's salmon could have used a bit more flavor. We cook similar dishes at home, and uhmm.. the quality of our homemade dishes trump Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis' offerings.   Overall, the experience wasn't terrible. But it wasn't quite the best. Vegas has better options.",

    "text": "Wow - seems like a lot of disgruntled diners have eaten here judging by all the negative reviews. Sure, it's not the best casino spot to eat in Vegas, but all the times I have been here it has not been all that bad. I was just here last month during a business trip and had a decent late night meal.  Basically, it is a glorified faux Parisian diner. You look up and around and see that you are sitting below a ceiling of blue skies, white fluffy clouds, and fake building fronts. I guess Le Cafe is trying to mimic the feel as if you are actually sitting in an outdoor cafe in Paris, enjoying a cappuccino while puffing away on a cigarette.  Sure, the service can be a bit \"spotty\" here and on the slow side, but it is open 24 hours and is a nice reprieve off the noisy casino floor. It's a decent enough place when you are craving a late night meal, breakfast, snack, or just want some coffee and a pastry. As with most casino eateries they can be a bit pricey and Le Cafe is no exception.  As a late night option when the clock is hitting midnight and most other restaurants are closed, or if you just don't feel like schlepping down the Las Vegas strip looking for a place to eat, Le Cafe is always there, open and available. Kind of like a Las Vegas \"escort\" hanging around the bar in a tight fitting dress and liquor on her breath.",

    "text": "I was reluctant to come here due to reviews about the wait being so long, but it was the closest place to my room and I've always been curious about this restaurant.  Let's just say the reviewers were right.  Once we were seated we waited maybe 15+ minutes just to order drinks, and another 15+ minutes just to order.  After we ordered, we waited another 30 minutes or so just to get our food, and so as you can imagine... we were not very happy and almost wanted to walk out.  No one even informed us that our food or a waitress was coming until we asked.  FORTUNATELY the food we ordered was fantastic.  My egg white omelette was delicious (see picture), as were the grilled veggies on the side.  I got a bite out of my dad's steak and it was nice and tender.  To sum up this review:  If you're down to wait a very long time to seat, order, and be served then you might be satisfied w/ this place.  I'm not sure if the wait is worth it, though, but luckily the quality of my omelette saved this place from me giving it a one star review.   If they had more staff on the floor this place would get a lot more positive reviews.  So yes, proceed w/ caution!",

Worse yet, there is Diamond / Seven Stars VIP line where you can get cut-off at just about anytime before you're seated.  They told us 45 minute wait -- which struck me as inexplicable given the only partially full restaurant.  Two couples jumped off line in front of us.  We got cut off by two Diamond members and we still seated in 10 minutes.  The inefficiency of this process should have been a clue as to the rest of the experience.  The place looks French and the menu reads French, but the food is neither terribly good, nor terribly French.  The onion soup arrived burned on top and without soup spoon.  The broth wasn't bad but it was really hard to eat with a teaspoon and, finding anyone to get us one took about 10 minutes.  I knew the second the waitress put it down that there was no soup spoon, but she was off like a shot before I could say anything.  The French Dip was almost inedible -- isn't the meat supposed to be either warm or lukewarm?  Theirs was cold, like from the refrigerator.  The jus wasn't bad.  The bread was nice.  The fries were disgusting, cold, and way too many of them.    The salade frisee was dried out, looking like the lettuce had been left out in the kitchen too long.  By the way, the bill for all of the mediocre food and service above, including two glasses of chardonnay, was $85 with tip.  Do not go here.  Find somewhere else.  And never, ever wait a half hour to eat here.",

As someone who's in the customer service business, I just have no patience for subpar service. I expect the basics at all times, no exceptions.  Anyway, we were finally seated after 10 minutes, already in a sour mood because of the inattentive hostesses. Things got a little better from there. The food was actually decent. I created my own omelette with mushrooms, some fancy French cheese, and some chicken sausage I think. Flavor was nothing special. The server was much friendlier than her peers at the front. Overall, this is a pretty unremarkable, run-of-the-mill cafe serving average food. There are way better options in Vegas. If there's no line and you're starving, go for it. Otherwise keep looking.",

We were flirting with hangry (never good) and meandered our way into Paris hotel to find this gem of a cafe; what a find! We were seated promptly at a cozy spot on the patio that featured the ambiance of faux Paris skyline and the casino all around; it is quite pleasant. Once seated our waiter came over and took our drink and food order in a very friendly and efficient manner. Soon our drinks as well as scrumptious bread and butter came out (good thing cause we were starving). They don't go cheap on the butter so be careful  We ordered breakfast with eggs , toast, waffles, berries, potatoes, and bacon. The food came out quickly, was hot, beautifully plated, and cooked just as it should be. Boy did it hit the spot! The waffle was crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle, the berries were ripe and sweet, the bacon was crispy, the toast was sourdough deliciousness, potatoes were charred, and seasoned beautifully, and the eggs were cooked to our liking. We were very happy with our food, and our waiter was attentive the entire lunch service.   The atmosphere couldn't be more inviting, and the prices are extremely reasonable. The menu offers lots of options such as salads, soups, sandwiches, breakfast, etc. I glanced at the surrounding tables and all the food they ordered looked good as well. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals which is a good sign!   We had a wonderful meal and fantastic service; needless to say we will be back!",

This spot had a short line up and a small bar down the hallways serving Mimosas and Bloody Marys to go. Heather grabbed a spot in the small line up, I grabbed us a couple of mimosas, and by the time we finished them (while enjoying a chat with a great couple from Seattle) we were seated.  It was past 11:00 AM so their full breakfast menu was off and the limited all day breakfast menu was my only option. Heather opted for a soup and salad combo... French Onion soup and garden salad. I ordered the St. Louis Signature breakfast... two eggs, breakfast potatoes, bread and toast, and applewood smoked bacon.  The service was great, and the food was good... just very run of the mill. Nothing stood out, it was just a forgettable meal to get us on our way for our day... likely why there was no line up. Nothing special here, basically a fueling station in the Paris. You could do much worse, but in Vegas you can also do much, much better with all the fantastic dining options.",

It was very disappointing.   Their hot coco was very silky and smooth. That was great. I would not come here again. If they can't get a croissant right, I don't want to try anything else.

The next time my parents went to eat here again but with a different server and he remembered my parents and asked about me and my husband. It's moments like that that make you want to come back.

A tiny shrimp cocktail appetizer, a very basic house salad, and soup/house salad combo for over $50? It wasn't necessarily a bad meal but I don't really think the food, service, or ambiance justifies the price. The seating right in the middle of the casino slot area is quite noisy and would not be my first choice. The salad was fresh and we were excited to be able to get blue cheese, our salad dressing of choice. Vegas kitchens love their fancy vinaigrettes and we have found blue cheese is actually hard to find on the strip so that was a plus. Salad portions were fair but my soup was 'cup' sized, so not much there. That might have actually been a good thing because I didn't care for it much. I ordered the chicken noodle and while I appreciate the ingredients all look fresh, the broth just didn't have enough flavor to it and I found it a bit bland. I didn't try the shrimp cocktail so can't speak to that. Service was also hit and miss. Our waiter would be friendly and laughing one minute and quite gruff the next, it was a bit off-putting. We love the bread at the bakery right down the hall but the mini-baguettes here are a bit hard to eat. They are crunchy and make a bit more of a mess than I would like. I just wasn't impressed with this one.",

We were served coffee and water very quickly and I ordered a Bloody Mary (without bacon).  When they brought the Bloody Mary out, it had bacon, but my SO excitedly ate it for me. :). I ordered the Eggs Benedict (without bacon) and my SO ordered the ham and cheese croissant. The waiter offered to exchange the bacon with something else so I said avocado.   When the meal came out it had a whole avocado on it. (Winning!) The hollandaise sauce was so good. The whole meal was very tasty. My SO said his croissant was tangy and flavorful. The service was exceptional. Our waiter was funny, friendly, and efficient. I would say don't get a Bloody Mary from here. It was the only things below par, otherwise everything else was good!",

The mushrooms alone were cooked well and tasty.  The three ravioli were ginormous, very cheesy and delicious.  Some might consider the dish very rich, but it was very good.  The warm bread and butter was a good accompaniment.  Our server was kind and attentive, and the food came out quickly.",

By that I mean we are locals and this restaurant is out to make money on the tourists.  We ordered a turkey burger which was good, and a BLT turkey croissant.  We asked for the bacon to be left off because my friend cannot eat bacon, and replaced with avocado. The waiter said it would be a $3.00 upcharge to give him a few slices of avocado.  I said I'm giving you back a meat (bacon) and you are going to charge me for the avocado.  I asked for the manager JON and he came to the table and explained.  There is a $3.00 charge to replace the bacon with avocado because this is a Strip restaurant and they can charge $3.00 for avocado.  I said I am local and can buy a avocado for 89cents in the supermarket and you aren't giving us the whole avocado.  He just shrugged and said that was the price.  So if you want to eat there, remember if you leave something off the sandwich that is OK, but if you replace it with anything they will charge you...... not a very nice policy if you ask me.......",

Food: Le Rosbif ( French Dip w/ Fries)   9/10   -- This sandwich has soooo much meat. It's tasty, and the meat is delicious though. The only issue I had was trying to dip the sandwich into the sauce bowl, the sandwich was so big. Very fullfilling for sure. I was super full after eating that meal.   Ravioli Au Fromager Ricotta 10/10 -- Very cheeesy.  Price: A little expensive but what do you expect it's Vegas.  Staff: Our waiter Alfred was very nice and attentive. He always made sure our water was topped off, always came back to refill our bread and butter. When I had an issue that need to be addressed  he fixed it with no hassle and took  care of it.  Totally worth the wait.",

Right by the door, near the kitchen.... there were a ton of open tables, ones with views of the hotel and shops, real cute, looks like a cafe on the streets of Paris.... not for us though. Then, the service was sloooooow, took forever before our waitress even came by.  I had to ask for water, and that took forever as well.  She just threw a loaf of cold bread on our table.  Husband liked the french dip... only thing that saved this. Fries... it looked like the bottom of a chip bag, all the crumsb, only lacking any flavor! and cold. The french onion soupd was ok, but sweet.  Ceasar salad.... guess I shouldn't had ordered this since it was a french restraunt.... bland, and I didn't the chick I ordered. She then said \"Oh yeah\" came back and threw a plate of very cold bad chicken on the table. I couldn't even eat it. No apology either.  Then the bill, she never asked for my rewards card. Charged me for the wrong items as well, which was twice as much than what I ordered.  I went to complain, but husband was mad and stormed out, I figured it wasn't worth it. Prices were average, maybe $40 for our entire bill?  Not worth it, wouldn't recommed at all. Wish we went to Mon Ami Gabi, but husband wanted something plainer.....",

No veggies, just a whole bunch of spiced ham (like salami?) and cheese. The roll that it came on tasted kinda bland too. I think what made it worse was that I am just not a huge fan of salami. I didn't know that's what \"French Ham\" was. Service wasn't particularly friendly either. I wouldn't say it was horrible in that she wasn't attentive, just the attitude/vibe I got from her was icy.

    "text": "Went in for breakfast the first morning we were at the Paris, and although there was a line to get a table, we were seated in respectable time.  That's about where the positives ended. I ordered the fruit platter and bacon strips with a coffee.  Waiter never brought half&half even though I requested 3 times, each time he walked by to be exact.  Finally I had to ask a bus-boy for it, whom brought it promptly.   The waiter had no idea what most of the items on the menu were.  My cousin asked about the beignets, he said he wasn't sure how they were. (no problem)  When it arrived, he brought out MUFFINS and when we questioned it, he said those were how they make beignets at this restaurant (apparently a French restaurant in a French themed hotel).   After pointing out (via photos on our phones) that these are not beignets, he brings out a new dish, this time donut holes.  Cold ones, to be exact, with the center of the pastries still a bit uncooked.  No beignets, not once.  Coffee was cold, my bacon was cold.  Just all in all, food wasn't the best.  Maybe it was our selections by sour chance, because other Yelpers seem to like the other menu selections. The icing on the donut hole came when we paid our bill with cash and the waiter questioned our tip to us.  Such lack of class, I would except better of a \"sit down\" \"French\" restaurant in a 4 star Vegas hotel, Center Strip.  Next time, use Yelp! and (if you drove your own car like we did) go eat off the strip, ESPECIALLY breakfast.  Or do a buffet.",

    "text": "This place should be called \"Le Cafe lle Bad Service.\" Never in my life have I been treated so horribly at a restaurant. My family and I went for lunch at 1 in the afternoon. There was no line and the inside was empty except for 3 other families. We were seated immediately.   Ten minutes after being seated, a busboy asked us what we'd like to drink. He barely understood our orders, ran around like a headless chicken, then disappeared into the kitchen. We were told our waitress will be over very soon to take our orders. I guess twenty minutes is considered very soon, because that's how long it took.   After taking our orders, we waited about ten more minutes until my iced-tea arrived. My parents' and brother's drinks were nowhere in sight. After complaining to the manager about the horrible service and informing him that we felt neglected, he simply smirked and replied \"I assure you that you're not being neglected.\" Yeah, that REALLY assured us.  I noticed that there were no waiters in sight, and the three families that were seated before us still did not have their drinks or food. One family complained to the manager and left. Finally, the rest of our drinks and our food arrived (we had been seated for a little over an hour now). The food was alright, DEFINITELY not worth the wait at all, and it wasn't even hot.   My soup came without a spoon so I asked my waitress for one; she said she will bring one right away. Five minutes later she came by our table to check on us, no spoon in sight. Again I asked for a spoon and she went to get one; she came back without a spoon once more! I asked for it one final time, and after a total of 10 minutes of not getting  a spoon I personally walked up to the utility station and took a spoon. Ridiculous!   DON'T EAT HERE; this place does not deserve your business at all! This was probably the fifth time I have eaten here in the past four years and each time the service seemed to get exponentially worse. This is totally unacceptable especially in Las Vegas where restaurants are extremely competitive.",

The potato salad was delicous!  prices were very reasonable in my opinion especially compared to the other casinos it came to 30 for both lunches and drinks.  The best part of this place is sitting on the \"patio\" where youa re in the casino so you feel like you're outdoors, especially if you enjoy the Paris.  I know most people don't really take kids to Vegas, but we were just on a quick day trip so we did have my son and there is no kids meal just as an FYI they do however have high-chairs.  Over all the place isn't a total loss but I think we'll try someplace else our next trip.",

The food is like American breakfast with a French twist.  My sister-in-law had the french toast and it was very decadent.  I had the baked eggs in marinara sauce, something I had never eaten before, and I enjoyed it.  The thick cut bacon is delicious.  However, we also dined here Saturday morning.  The service was horrible.  It took 20 minutes for the waitress to finally come around and take our order.  The table next to us left because they waited so long.  Once we got our food, it seemed like our waitress forgot about us.  We could not get drink refills and had to chase her down for the check.  The people two tables away who were seated before us were clearly upset and requested their check as soon as they saw the waitress at our table picking ours up for payment.  The food was good Saturday morning also, however, it almost seemed like we were eating a different restaurant.  The potatoes were prepared differently even though we had ordered them the same as before.  Also, the english muffins looked like small pancakes rather than larger fluffy rounds of toast.  I was told later this was because the smaller ones were hand made.  Not sure why they change it up...??  I must mention I had the fried eggs the second day and they were served over pork cakes.  Very delicious, but did not care for the potatoes.  My overall opinion, I will not go back nor would I recommend it to a friend going to Vegas.",

It look 10 minutes for the waiter to check on me, and when I mentioned the sauce he said he'd be right back, 10 minutes later he came back and my food was ice cold.  He left without allowing me to mention that so I could request a warm up, and when I had to flag him down ten minutes later he acted like it was my fault my food was cold, and they must have put it in the microwave because when he brought it back the bernaise sauce had broken.  I was obviously starving by this time, so attempted a bite.  It was disgusting. I ate the pickle spear.  When he made his way back to our table, he saw the plate and said 'no good', and I shook my head, so he took the plate away, then brought us our bill.  No apologies or attempt to ask if I would like something else. My husband had their special prix fixe, and by the time the bill came he had to run to the bathroom.  I am not kidding.  He was sick!!

Since they had a special for $39, I couldn't resist and my friend Ian will kill me for not telling him I ate here. I ordered red wine, French onion soup, filet mignon medium rare with a side of baked potato and sauted mushrooms and for dessert chocolate layer cake.   ROOM CHARGE!  First I had the bread basket with the warm butter and that was delicious and was a good pre-starter before the appetizer. My French Onion soup was good but I had better and my entree was very tender juicy and the two sides was a great addition to the entree.  Lastly the dessert (chocolate mouse layer cake) was very rich indeed with the berry and cranberry on the side of the dish. Yum mee!!  The service here is so far excellent and the staff here are very friendly.  I'll be back to try other stuff on the menu if I'm ever near by.",

It's hit and miss here and the breakfasts are a notch above Denny's or similar. That being said we had an awesome late night munch there last week. A Turkey Ruben on perfectly toasted rye and everything worked, the kraut was fresh, the sauce spot on and the fries were perfect. My gal ordered a Cesar that was actually really good. The lettuce was crisp and fresh with lots of flavor and not thoroughly drenched in dressing.   Service was great too, as this place can have spotty service at times.",

I love the aesthetic of the place, I feel like it smells better here than in some other places, I don't know what it is, I just enjoy it in Paris.  So we were wandering around the casino and shops in the evening, and decided to grab a bite here on our way out.  We sat on the terrace, which is a nice spot to people watch, though it was a bit louder than I was hoping for at dinner time.  I can forgive that, after all, it's a casino in vegas, what did I expect?  I cannot, however, forgive the food I was served.  Myself and my partner both ordered steak frites.  What we were served was not appetizing at all.  The steak was grey, and about 20% of the steak was gristle.  The remainder of the steak was drowning in oil, not drizzled with, not garnished with, it was sitting in a puddle of oil on a plate.  It was disgusting.  I took a few bites of it, and the flavor was not any better than the presentation; bland, uninspired, worse than a steak at IHOP.  My partner sent hers back, and we were not charged for it, which was good,  but even that doesn't make up for how awful the food was in the first place.  Avoid this place!  If you want steak frites, go to Mon Ami Gabi, across the gaming floor, pay a couple bucks extra, and get a good meal.",

My steak was perfect and both sides delish! The chocolate cake was rich and the mousse filling was awesome.   We were seated right away, our server was attentive, drinks kept refilled and food served in a timely manner , starting with the wonderful french bread roll's baked together like a loaf of bread. I would definitely eat here again",

The next day we came in again and had the 3 course pre fixed dinner. I started with the wedge salad, then had the filet tips wrapped in bacon with a side of mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and everything was seasoned well and very tasty. For desert I had a giant slice of chocolate cake which was rich and perfect! All 3 courses were $39! By Vegas standards that's quite a bargain. They have really cute patio seating which is great for people watching. This place should have a much higher Yelp rating, it was so good!!! Will come back next time we are in Vegas!",

When we get in and get seated, it takes about 7-10 minutes before someone came over to take our drink order!  We gave the gentleman out drunk order and then proceeded to ask him a question about the menu!  He stopped us very quickly and said, \"you have to ask your waiter!\"  Ok!

They had a special 3 course meal to choose from for $40 which I thought logically made sense..It began with a french onion soup which did come hot (contrary to a review saying it was lukewarm) and actually one of the better ones I've had..Not too salty and it didn't smell funky either..I had a filet mignon medium rare as a main course..It actually was a perfect cut of meat and cooked as it should, but the one flae for me was it being under seasoned..I did have some sauteed mushrooms/onions and mac n cheese with it..there wasn't much special about the mushrooms, but the sauce for the mac n cheese won the meal over for me..the sauce was just flowing bite to bite and just gave it cheesy goodness within each forkful..I did end it with a NY cheesecake..They give HUGE pieces and this was one of the better ones I've had..It was light on cream cheese, but delivered in taste for sure!  Long story short, really read the reviews on Yelp and make your OWN choice about things..I mean yeah I saw 2 1/1 stars and said ummz, am I making a bad decision? Yes to each it's own, but when I see oh it took long to get food and a bad rating I think isn't Yelp about the FOOD? If you're grouchy about that either you waited too long to eat, don't have enjoyable company, or you just should eat a bag of chips and beef jerky in the gift shop..I thought the place rocked and I give them a thumb up for an enjoyable experience!",

The first batch was obviously not fresh, but the second batch was so warm and soft and obviously straight from the oven ..   I ordered a rare ahi tuna burger which was good when I put all my coleslaw in it. Such a nice tangy flavor contrast!

Anyhoo...the burger I had was decent, and I got it with a yummy side of coleslaw.  The food was no-frills, but it the spot wonderfully.  My friend got their duck crepe, which was filled with tender duck breast and topped with a creamy sauce. Super tasty!  Coffee was piping hot, which was nice, and the refills plentiful.  True to the IHOP-feel, it comes in a thermos for you to refill your own.  I needed lots and lots of caffeine for the day, so the thermos was actually quite appreciated.  :P",

If there was a way to give this place '0 Stars' I would but sadly there isn't so you'll have to read this little rant of mine.   Here is the situation. It was late at night (1:00am) and this was one of the few places open in the casino so our group (4 20 somethings) decided to stop searching the Strip for a meal and park it at the next closest table.   We arrived at this poor excuse for a restaurant and was greeted by quite possibly the worst hostess in the history of life. After I asked for a table for 4 she just looked back at me in such a blank manner I thought I should repeat myself.   So I did.   Then after the 2nd go around she sat us down to a table and threw the menus on the table. (lovely)   After having about 25 mins to go over the menus, the 'garcon' arrived with such dissatisfaction of our party, her current working situation and/or her life (it was unclear at this point.)   If the bad service wasn't enough the food was worse. I ordered French Onion Soup (pretty basic for a 'French' Restaurant) and it came back look warm, toast was burnt black, too much cheese and absolutely ZERO flavor. The Campbells French Onion Soup is better I think.   ===================================================  If you decide to go to Vegas and eat late night somewhere stay CLEAR of the Paris Casino. It is atrocious.",

    "text": "Was wandering around for a place to eat and stopped here when we saw their special - $39 for (1) soup or salad (2) prime rib or steak entree w/ 2 sides (3) dessert. Didn't think yelp reviews wouid be so low for such a place (I should have figured with the many empty tables though). But still, I like this place. They had a line forming outside their entrance even though they had many empty tables (I had thought they were reserved at the time). But I guess they were just taking their time seating people.  I had the special and tried the French Onion Soup... which was a bit salty for me (and nothing special). For the entree, I opt for the steak (forgot what cut though). Steak was pretty tender. It was had flavor, but not marbled enough. I requested creamed spinach and mac & cheese for my sides. The kitchen screwed up and gave me creamed corn instead of mac & cheese. But I didn't complain, because it was the best creamed corn I've had. I always though Lawry's in Beverly Hills made the best creamed corn... but I like it here more! So glad they screwed up my order! The creamed spinach is just whatevers. I figured after a few days of pigging out in Vegas... I should put some dark green veggies in me which is why I picked this instead of fries.  My boyfriend ordered the foie gras with caramelized apples burger which I tried a piece of. Either this place didn't make it right, or I find nothing fancy about foie gras (it was my first time trying). For dessert, I took my chocolate cake to go because I was too full to eat it at the restaurant. Heck I was too full to eat it at all until the next morning. But.. the cake was still really moist the next morning. I regret not eating it the night before lol. One thing really worth mentioning is our waiter Jose. He is probably one of the nicest waiter I've ever had! Kitchen service needs improvement though. It felt like forever waiting for our food and the restaurant wasn't packed. And they need to pay attention to people's orders. I might have liked the fact that they gave me creamed corn instead, but it might not always be this way. Overall I think this is a decent place for food. Would be better if they were faster.",

Side servers were fine but the lady serving us ( I really wish I got her name) was a complete bitch... terrible server... etc etc. Asked for waters all around, only about half the people ended up actually getting water (wtf?). Order probably took about an hour (and we all ordered the 2 egg breakfast) and even then one of our orders didn't even come out and took another 10 minutes to get to us. We asked for bread also when we ordered and the basket of bread probably took a good half hour to come out.... Server was a ghost for most of the time and I think one of my friends had to get up and walk around the restaurant to find her for something he needed and all she was doing was standing in the back talking. I was literally ready to walk out of this place and if I wasn't leaving for the drive home right after I would have. Keep in mind this wasn't at 4am or any ridiculous hour but around 11 or 11:30 on a Sunday so I would hope for better service than this.   Cliff notes: don't ever come here... ever.",

Gotta wait to be seated off to the side, we just sat and they made us go outside.  If you can, try to sit outside for the ambiance, cause the inside looks like a Denny's, and its harder to sit inside once you see what it looks like outside.  Foods typical fare w/a some french goodies in there.  They used to serve a really great chicken noodle soup w/rotisserie chicken at the Paris, I got it for room service once, I'm assuming it's the same soup throughout the hotel, if it is, it's just typical soup now.  Friends had the au jus dip sandwich which they said was good.  There were also some grave yard specials available too which was nice, better to eat them there than at some two star hotel  service was ok although my friend had to remind the waitress about three times for her milk for her tea",

In a previous trip here (a LONG time ago), I found the food to be amazingly delicious, but this time - not so much.  I ordered the Chef Special: Filet Mignon with a bunch of other stuff attached to it.  It was definitely NOT what I expected. As it turns out, they were filet mignon pieces, not a full on steak, and the vegetables were tasteless.    The customer service is okay.  Servers are nice enough, but there were times when I felt a bit rushed.  I HATE being rushed when it comes to my food.  That was a boo on them, but considering my aunt teased our waiter about his name, we'll just call it even.  Overall, it really is a last resort.  When it's 11pm and you're hungry, your options are pretty limited...and when you don't want to travel far because of the cold weather outside (as was the case for me), you deal with what you have.  I would have given it 2 stars, but the time before that was a 4 star, so we're averaging it out. :\\",

The menu looked promising, though expensive. I wasn't super hungry, so I just ordered the Clam Chowder, which was suprisingly delicious! Lots of clams and not too many potatoes (I HATE when there are too many potatoes) AND it wasn't too heavy. My friends also seemed to enjoy their food. It did take awhile, but I guess that makes sense at 4am.  The waiters were nice enough, but I feel like it was difficult and took forever to get our check. We were all really sleepy, as it was very late at night and we had eaten until our bellies were full, so this was a great annoyance.  Overall, the food is decent, expensive (but what isn't in Las Vegas?), but the service was a little shaky. I appreciate that this place is open late, but I think I'll be trying some other restaurants the next time I venture into Paris.",

    "text": "After a night at le Cafe, I felt compelled to create a yelp account and reflect on the unbelievably poor service provided to us by the waitstaff. Being a patron of Paris Las Vegas and Ballys for over 20 years, I was shocked to see how rude and patronizing the workers here were.  After being seated, we waited about 15 minutes until we were approached by a busboy who took our drink order. He assured us that our waitress would soon come and take our order, yet it took about 20 minutes more (a conservative estimate) for the waitress to show up. Meanwhile, our drinks were MIA, so I asked to see the manager.   What a spit in the face it was when, 10 minutes later, a disgruntled gentleman (Mr. Manager) approached our table, and unapologetically told us to be more patient. When I told him that we were being neglected, he responded with \"what do you want me to do about it?\" then proceeded to walk away, mumbling insults under his breath. 40 minutes later our food came, tasty but nothing special.   The management at this establishment need to understand that their customers are not cattle, nor are we fools. Shame on you Mr. Manager for treating us so rudely. I will never return here for a meal, and neither should you, unless your looking for a way to kill 2 hours while you're starving.",

The menu was basic but attempted a pseudo French flair to make it appear as though it was a step above a run-of-the-mill restaurant. But the location being situated smack dab in the middle of a noisy, heavily trafficked lobby, and the quality of food did little to convince me.   I had the seared tuna salad. The tuna was absolutely overcooked and the potatoes were very large and seemed shoved into the salad along with the unruly green beans. The glass of Riesling was ok. Granted, the service was adequate and they do make an effort to capture the look of a Parisian cafe (blue painted skies and random Parisian decor) but the hectic atmosphere overshadows all. This is great for a quick and somewhat inexpensive bite but certainly not the creme de la creme of Vegas' culinary offerings.",

The service is pretty good here. It's not the best, and it's not 5 diamonds but considering for what it is, I will give 3 stars. The waiter did spill water on my sister simply because of negligence.   The food is not the best. Infact it will most likely be very unsatisfying to most people because of the taste. Their food is bland, simple, and not very flavorful in general. However if you've been partying it up on the strip and need a place that is in your hotel, this is the place you can go to. The light tasteless food will help your tummy. As for recommendations, I'm not entirely sure what I would recommend. Firstly my group ordered a lot of Asian food, we do not recommend it. Another ordered your all American tuna sandwich and that's not too bad, so the safest is to stick to very American food here. Food that is simple and easy to make will be the safest. Secondly they are busy so you probably shouldn't expect it to come out steaming hot. It's rather unfortunate for a restaurant in a prime location with great decor to have such poor quality food. The servers however are amiable. That is what I give the extra star for.",

Yes for this turkey croissant and for the breakfast (which doesn't have much options) no because like i said. Not to much options. But go for it and give it a taste.",

Not many hearty options for vegetarians, and while the beet salad with arugula and goat cheese was tasty, there was WAY too much cheese (which is just odd for me to say).   They bring bread and butter before the meal. Though the butter is doused in salt, making for a very yucky pre-eating experience.   Pros  - You can probably get in fairly easily  Mids  - Food is okay  Cons  - Service sucks   I will not be returning. Ever.",

Very paris like ;)  The waiter took our orders and we waited a good 20 minutes to get our food :(  St. Louis Signature: ($15)- two eggs any style, including a side of thick cut slab bacon and roasted fingerling potatoes.  This pretty much tasted mediocre.  I could make this way better!  This was just your ordinary typical eggs, bacon, and potatoes.  The bacon was the best part but I feel that I could play like $2 and get the same thing at McDonalds!  1/2 Soup/Sandwich combo ($16)- ordered the french onion soup which was delicious and got the chicken salad sandwich.  Mediocre as well.  Felt that Corner Bakery or Panera is way better and cheaper!  I understand it is \"Paris\" but come on, the food is very bland and it just wasn't that enjoyable.  Probably will not come back.  NOTE: -Slow service -Bathrooms around the corner",

I don't know where the Chef got his recipe of croque monsieur but it sure was not in Paris! It was prepared with 2 thick slices of texas bread which were not even toasted, there was almost zero bechamel sauce, the cheese on top was not even fully melted, much less gratine. It was absolutely awful.  I refused to eat it and I told the waiter to take this \"thing\" off my bill.  I should also have asked him to take the diet pepsi off my bill too because there's no way this was Pepsi. It was one of these cheap cola drinks you can buy at some low price grocery stores, with this weird taste of medicine, but definitely not the Pepsi brand. So please, when I order a Diet Coke, don't tell me \"Diet Pepsi\" when in reality it's \"Diet Cheapo Cola\".  On the other hand, I highly recommend the croque monsieur at \"Mon ami Gaby\" as well as their onion soup.",

The breakfast was delicious - the Eggs Benedict and the fruit plate.  Service was good.  Our second time was for a quick breakfast and we ordered the French Toast and another fruit plate.  Again the food was delicious and fruit plate was plentiful.  The only negative is the pricing of the dishes.  Spending $65 for a good breakfast is very overpriced. Customers can get a better deal at the nearby Village buffet with made-to-order crepes and omelettes for under $50.",

For me the service was a 6 star. I am sure I will find the food very good, I would still recommend not ordering the corned beef hash with the fried cubed potatoes.  Below from July 8th-  I had great service from being greeted at the entrance to being seated ....my waiter and assistant were very attentive. I ordered Corn Beef Hash....asking whether it was from a can or real corn  beef from a brisket. assured it was excellent. I eat in so many restaurants and run a food blog,  recipe forum. Believe me, this version of corn beef hash is not anywhere else only this restaurant. The horrible cubed potatoes were hard and probably made days earlier...same with the corn beef hash...rubber! Two stars for 2 perfect poached eggs, sourdough toast and a nice glass of ice water and the service.....although no one of authority came out.....what would I want from them? Maybe an adjustment or substitute something edible....I was still hungry...I only ate about 5 bites of the plasticy rubbery food but could not continue.",

I got the French onion soup, chicken grand'mere, and napoleon pastry for dessert.   The French onion soup tasted pretty packaged, but it was what we needed after a long night.  The rotisserie chicken was rather good and came in large portions. I believe they used Cornish hens and used half per plate. The chicken was moist and filling, and the rice with cheese bedding was probably the best part.  My friend ordered the salmon, which she said was okay.  The fruit teas were good, but I think peach had the most natural flavor.  I'd eat here again.",

We continued walking and found this place that only had a small line, and bonus, had an all day breakfast menu along with their lunch and dinner options!  We were seated within about 10 minutes and ordered mimosas (they were good).  I ordered the fixed lunch menu that was only $20 for a salad, a choice of 3 entrees (I had the croque monsieur), and a napoleon for dessert. My husband, loving eggs, opted for the croque madame lunch meal.  I really wanted fries also, so I asked the waiter and he said that he would bring some to me. We started with delicious french bread and then my salad came with an excellent bleu cheese dressing.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed our sandwiches. The bread they used was delicious as was the cheese.   The little mini napoleon I got in the end was also great!...even though it was about 3 bite's worth LOL.  We were definitely glad we tried this place! It was delicious and a quick bite! We would certainly return!",

Boyfriend ordered the Paris burger: came with fries and a weird sour sauce. Burger had no flavor or seasonings. The fries where probably the best thing on that plate.

I forget my breakfast team but she was amazing.    For our second dinner, Rey and Wilson seemed distracted and overworked! I suspect they are good, however we felt ignored and our plates stayed on our table way to long after we were done. Rey seems nice and tried to make up for it, however a little to late.  Food took way to long!  Food was good, make sure they know that you want your meat medium rare not medium.  Cheesecake came with the special... Delicious!",

The patio seating really gives you the whole sidewalk cafe experience. Fast forward many years. They no longer have French toast on the menu. The patio seating is still there but they reduced it to make room for a Chinese restaurant.  We skipped them for breakfast (no French toast) but went for lunch one day. We both had the French onion soup and salmon dishes.  Food was good, no complaints but nothing really exciting. Service was good but again....everything about this place is now average.  It's quick, conveniently located for people watching, food is adequate.  No big positive or negative swings...filled the void.",

So this review isn't after one bad experience.  GOOD: the food is good but not great. Granted all I've had was breakfast but the food is the only reason I have returned. The initial sitting is good as there are a few people who walk around getting drinks and coffee. They are prompt, kind, and have coffee and cream in hand. That is where the good ends  BAD: the service is extremely SLOW. Every time I have been it's taken on average 5-10 mins just to get someone to say hello. An \"I'll be right with you\" goes a long way. I've been a server in my younger years. I know how it works. They are polite, never have had an argument there, but the lack of attention is obvious. When it comes to the check half of them are MIA while the other half present it in a timely manner.  Service is half the experience. I gave two stars because the friendliness and food are good. The service is the reason I wouldn't have given four stars.",

We came here for lunch and the atmosphere is very \"Fake Paris\" with a lovely view of the casino. The menu was mostly sandwiches and salads, so I ordered the turkey burger and my BF had the turkey club.  Boasting a fried egg on top and cranberry aioli, I was excited to eat my turkey burger because it sounded pretty decent and I was starving. It was inedible. It tasted like a frozen turkey patty that was reheated poorly (and I don't doubt that's exactly what it was). It was tough and flavorless, and the raspberry aioli tasted weird. I picked at it and tried to enjoy my fries. They were cold and had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp. I was annoyed and hungry when I left.  My boyfriends club sandwich was pretty good, but compared to my awful dish, anything would  have tasted better.   If you are hungry and don't want to wait, go to the pizza place down the \"streets of Paris\" or better yet, go to The Sugar Factory or anywhere else but this place!",

The cheddar cheese was overwhelming as it took up the entire omelette and was an unappealing, fake-looking orange color. Cheese is my favorite food, but this was just too much. I had to pick it out from the omelette or I was going to throw up eating all that cheese. Having a pile of orange goop on my plate during my meal made me lose my appetite quickly.   This was an incredibly overpriced dish at $17. I will never ever return here again. My family agreed that the food is horrible. Plus, the cups and utensils smelled like ass. I had to use my hand sanitizer to wipe down my fork. Please save your money and stomach and go anywhere else. This is your vacation and nothing ruins the mood faster than a crappy meal.",

Almost.   The food is good, not great. The bloody Mary was disappointing. The servers are busy hurried and, well act like Parisian waiters, who can be stand-offish.   We ate there once for dinner and once for lunch. The salmon burger was good, probably a Trader Joes frozen patty or similar, on a brioche bun with cole slaw. It was tasty, but nothing special. Cobb Salad was filled with the good stuff and tasty. Ceasar salad was good, but you have to ask for the anchovies, although it's included on the menu. Our party had several plates, all which were acceptable to good. Again, the food isn't bad, but just nothing you will remember. The ambiance, however, is worthy of the experience.",

The dinner however, the bread was hard and barely warm. The Asian waiter was slow in the beginning until we stared at him waiting to order for over 15 minutes. Every time he asked us a question or answered us it was to the point and when he would fill our glasses he would slam the cups down on the table hard. We were barely eating our food and he asked if we wanted dessert lol. Overall I will give this place 4 stars because of the good food",

It was topped with a few perfectly ripened teardrop tomatoes and some chopped cucumber. The ranch dressing was divine - did not taste bottled. Service was good but not overbearing.

It also came out cold. We split the French dip and it was a decent size, but the meat had that reheated flavor and it was also cold.

Menu has limited dining options, especially if you aren't there for breakfast. Can't remember specifically what we had, it was that mediocre. The dining area is practically on the casino floor itself, which makes for a noisy and smoky experience.   Service was ridiculously slow considering they weren't busy. Food was not hot when it came out, and barely passed for warm. Server was not attentive, cups did not get refilled, bill seemed twice as high as our experience warranted.

We were staying at Paris and I noticed a sign for a three course meal for $39. The meal included a starter, an entree with two sides, and dessert. What a deal!  What's even better is you can reserve a table with <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a>, and pay with your total rewards points. I'm a platinum total rewards member, so I really didn't have to make reservations, but why waste passing up 100 points?   We scored 9:30 PM reservations, and was seated immediately. We were seated in the patio, which attempted to make us feel like we were dining alfresco, next to the smoke-filled casino. I thought that dining in the middle of a casino with annoying me, but frankly I didn't even notice the people walking by.   It took a few minutes for someone to take our drink orders, and took a little while for our bread as well. Service was a little slow, and we had to request our drinks twice. But since I read  the reviews on yelp, I wasn't expecting a lot of fast service.   I ordered the wedge salad, the New York steak with creamed corn and Yukon potatoes, and the berries and cream for dessert. Stephen had the wedge salad, the mixed grill with creamed spinach and Mac n cheese, and cheesecake for dessert.  Food wise, it was pretty good. It wasn't the same caliber as Flemings, but for $39, I could not complain.  Our first course came out within 20 minutes, and our entrees came out shortly after. There was plenty of food and we were full, so we took our desserts to go since our hotel room had a refrigerator.  Overall a decent experience, and I must say I was pretty pleased that we had decent service. Aside from asking our waiter for drinks twice, I could not find a lot of fault with this place.  I guess I couldn't find any fault because the food was comped, since I use my total rewards points to pay for everything.   I'd come back, but only if I paid with comp points.",

She was a very funny and pleasant person, and checked on us often throughout our meal. We really liked her.   We had a choice of Caesar salad, house salad or French onion soup as first course.

    "text": "\"Bonjour, mon ami.  Lardons, si vous plait\"  Located conveniently by the hotel elevators at the Paris Las Vegas hotel, Le Cafe Ile St. Louis offers French American cuisine, specializing in breakfast/brunch.  A cute facade makes diners feel they are in city of lights, with dining inside or \"al fresco\", which in this case means overlooking the casino floor.  I chose to sit \"al fresco\" both times I dined here, as it gave ample opportunity to people watch, both those gambling & those walking by, and to enjoy the filtered casino air.  I assumed seating inside would be rather stuffy.  As previously mentioned, I dined at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis on two occasions, for dinner then for breakfast the next day.  Here's the 411-  Dinner - There was very little wait & was quickly led to a table.  While waiting for my order to arrive, crusty bread & butter were placed on our table- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> By crusty, I mean crusty.  The outer layer of bread was as crusty as my tidy whities after my first wet dream.  Yes, that crusty!  Inside, though, was airy & soft.  The butter was crack to me.  I asked for another helping of it, as I was liberally dousing each piece of bread w/ butter.  I even helped myself to spoonfuls applied directly to mouth, w/o the interference of bread.  Calamari - Fried squid w/ crispy onions, fennel, lemon & a dijon mustard vinaigrette $12- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#kVwRy-qO3v8PJYyLn5u9aw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> This was delicious.  Generous portions, fried crisp & light with a captivating vinaigrette.  I asked for more of said vinaigrette because I was bathing each piece of calamari and/or onion with it.    Burger and foie gras - Angus beef, pate de foie gras, caramelized apples, balsamic gastrique on a brioche bun w/ pomme frites $18- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#MeXfEou-G1FANcmYRGUT5w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> Tres bien!  What sold it for me was the foie gras, a food item that was recently banned for sale in California.  It's like meat butter.  I delighted in the medium-rare goodness- <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#b40GDQLSlIUeiYa7GWeWQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> The pomme frites (french fries) were, sadly, soggy & limp.  I guess they spent too much time w/ the Paris go-go dancer the previous night ;p She sure knew how to twerk it, so I don't blame the fries for being limp LOL  Creme brulee $8 -  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#I2QqmkDyFQxm4iGwkx9Y_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> Ahhh, the crispy sugar shell forming a roof over the thick creme underneath.  This was magnifique!  I savored each & every bite, delighting in the burnt flavoring of the sugary shell.  Breakfast - There was about a 5 min wait, so it wasn't long before being seated \"al fresco\".  Complimentary toasted bread of choice was provided.  I chose sourdough & extra of that fantastic butter.    Corned beef hash w/ two poached eggs $15 - <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-cafe-ile-saint-louis-las-vegas?select=nag8tyKxp8-Wzocr7jGkBQ#Lbn2VWRXcYHOWnJDlIpQ2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/le-c...</a> Hearty, rich, stick to your ribs good!  I relished each & every bite, as the runny egg yolks slithered down the hash, making for a delectable meal.  Quality portions, worth the $15.  Cafe latte $5 - This could French kiss my derriere.  Weak coffee in a small cup.  I thought the Europeans were known for how strong they like their coffee.  This was more like Folgers.  The Gevalia I brew at home is leaps & bounds better than this drivel.  Service was good, as extra butter was brought out & drinks were refilled.  Seating is plentiful throughout, w/ my recommendation of dining \"al fresco\".  I enjoyed my 2 dining experiences here at Le Cafe Ile St. Louis.  It's Vegas, so the prices can be a little high for what you get, but I mostly enjoyed the food I had the pleasure of eating here.  Plus, the convenience of having the restaurant located right outside the hotel elevators make stopping here a breeze.  Recommend!  Au revoir!  NOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM",

For what's available around, this is what Paris has to offer and even with the somewhat $$ prices, you'll be pleased to know its exactly what you expect.  It's not extravagant, and the only reason to come here at 6am in the morning for reliable breakfast food is because A) you've been out partying too damn hard and barely anything would taste bad at this point, or B) you've become baller status and the first grand meal to reap your winnings outta be good and light since you drank all those whiskey on the rocks down during the conquest.    Therefore, I'm not sayin its the best place to eat, but for 6am breakfast, its worth checking out if you're nearby.",

    "text": "We were walking around the Paris hotel and thought we would stop by for dinner here. They had a special for the day with a nice 3 course meal for $39.  I had the french onion soup and it was really good. I got the mixed meats course where I ordered the mashed potatoes which was decent but could tell it was microwaved but the mushrooms dish with 5 different mushrooms which was pretty good. My meal also included two small lamb chops, a spicy italian sausage, and a petite mignon. The lamb was decent, sausage was dry, and the cook could not get the filet mignon right. I ordered it medium (pink and juicy). The first time it came out charred and over cooked and the second time, after I had sent it back it came rare and soft. The sausage looked like it was on a hot flame but the inside was dry and one end was cool to cold. For dessert the cheese cake came in and it was yellow and buttery, with not much cheese. We agreed it was like eating a sweet and salty stick of butter. My GF had the fish dish, I think it was salmon and she said it was OK but nothing special.  They were nice enough to try to make my meal right but ended up just getting filled up on the lamb and mushrooms.   Overall, the service was outstanding and a floor supervisor even noticed I hadn't eaten much of the beef and asked if I would want a drink on the house. I kindly declined.  I imagine the kitchen had a hot flame and try to make the cook time faster but if they would use just a tad lower flame and a couple minutes longer to grill things the food would have probably been very good. We'll probably stop by for the french onion soup again next time, nice service but the food can use just a little work, the restaurant has potential.",

    "text": "It wasn't my first time dining here, probably the 4th or 5th but I think I finally hit a wall with this place. The other times were semi decent and warranted returning visits. After this weekend though, I'm over it. We had a big party so we understood that it was going to take some time to get a table. Even the wait for the table itself wasn't bad. The suck came when we sat down. I'm not going to play the blame game and start pointing fingers either because our waitress seemed genuinely sweet. I just don't know whose fault was it so I might as well blame the entire establishment.  We got our table and menu. Some time passed before we were greeted or quite frankly acknowledged period. It was the first meal of the day and we were all craving a bite especially after a long intoxicating night. When we finally got the greet, just like any standard operating restaurant policy, drink orders were taken. Time ticked. Table of guys, trust me when I say guys know what they want to eat within a few minutes especially when you're hungry like a bear. Okay, drinks come and orders taken. Here is where it gets ugly.  Again, I've grown up in the restaurant business and understand when there's a big party it takes some time to get all the food out for a big table. Of course, the restaurants my family owned were all small hole in the walls. We were in Vegas, Paris hotel, 24 hour cafe, get your cooking line straight or maybe you need a Chef Ramsay visit? We sat, sat, sat. Friend got so bored, he passed around the keno sheet and we were picking numbers. He took three trips to the keno booth and still no food. Draw Something, Words with Friends, was being played by 80% of the table. There was a table of five women who sat down some time after us and they were half way through their meal. What did we have, bread & butter. Yeah, it was good bread & butter but where the F is my meal? I didn't order Australian Wagyu Steak. It was sunny side eggs, potatoes, bacon, and toast. Most of the guys on the table ordered soup/salad/sandwich combos. How long does it really take? Tick tock, tick tock, how deep does the rabbit hole go? No exaggerations. Trust me, I don't like to bash restaurants (just look at the majority of my reviews; mostly positive) but this was ridiculous.   We finally got our meals and yeah it was decent. Nothing bad to say about our food. The guy who kept refilling our drinks must've felt bad because he kept bringing drinks over in attempt to keep us calm. Before most of us were done, we asked for the check in advance because seriously, we were done with the place & wanted to just roll.   We were just looking for a simple and quick lunch but this ordeal turned into an unnecessary two hour+ fiasco. Not even an apology for the lag but whatever, you guys are Vegas and people will still return. Money will continue to flow inwards, but I will happily throw my extra cash and help put the strippers through college before I return to this cafe.",

We did not see our first bowl of soup until an hour and a half after we arrived. And we all ordered about 10 minutes after we were seated. However, we did have a pretty large party of about 12 people so we expected things might be a little longer of a wait. After waiting a little over two and a half hours we finally got food. Which sucked by the way. The only good thing was the French onion soup. In the end we met one manager that offered to buy a round of drinks for the table - SAL was amazing and attended to us better than our own server and even another manager we spoke to earlier in the night.",

    "text": "I should have read the reviews first.  If the reviews are that spread out its obviously \"hit or miss\".  This was my first and last time going there. It was definitely a giant miss for me.  After being seated and waiting for so long, I was about to just leave when the waiter called out on his way from the next table that he would right there.  After another long wait, he finally showed up. When asked about any of the menu items, he just looked confused.  When ordering a wine with dinner he had to put his finger on the page and leave with the wine list. Of course during this time, we had to specifically ask for water to drink be brought to the table.   For the appetizers, I had the French Onion Soup (not bad), while my companion had the Tomato Salad which consisted three slices of tomato with baby sprigs and a dressing. Hardly enough to be considered a salad.   When the entrees arrived. They both looked, felt and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for far too long. My prime rib was cold as well as my \"whipped\" (mashed) potatoes. My companion had the club sandwich with rosemary pomme frittes (French Fries). Its hard to mess up a club sandwich, but the fries were cold, limp and greasy.  EVERYTHING had to be sent back to the kitchen!  My meal came out a second time and it was correct. My companions pomme frittes came out in the same state as the first attempt. She just gave up and simply said \"never mind\" to the fries.   During the course of the meal our drinks ran low and eventually empty. My companion had to go to the hostess stand and ask if the manager could stop by our table with some water.   When Mark the manager showed up, we conveyed our experiences with Rey the waiter.  He of course politely apologized. And offered to \"adjust\" the bill, which Rey promptly delivered. Rey seemed to have forgotten the the special I ordered came with dessert, so I had to remind him.  Of course coffee wasn't offered so I had to flag Rey down for som coffee. When we got our coffee, Rey was distracted by something else yet again and just put his carafe on the table in front of me like we were at an Ihop.  Since we ordered coffee, he had to add that to the bill and we had to flag him down yet again.   SERVICE: Horrible FOOD:  Mediocre (at best)  For the guy that said \"not that bad\", I ask you how does it have to be before you feel like your time and money has been wasted?  How important is you time and how hard do you work for you money?  If you value either, you won't waste it at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis.",

    "text": "This was by far one of the worst dinning experiences I've ever had. While in Vegas with friends we stumbled upon this place and just decided to try it. For some reason it didn't occur to me to check Yelp before we went in, huge mistake. We walked in and noticed the cheesy and very generic look of the business. After being seated,  our very unhappy middle aged server walks up to ask for our drink order. After several minutes our water and my Sierra Mist come out in the hands of the unhappy woman and she sets them down on the table. Having ample time to decide what to get we order. My friend asked her about what she thought of a dish and she simply stated \"It's good\" in a really monotone voice, way to sell it lady!  After we look around at the unhappy faces, read the terrible reviews on yelp, and took in the terrible ambiance, we start talking about leaving. Before we have a chance our unfriendly server comes up and pours water in my soda. My friend explains to her politely that it was soda and she says \"Oh\" and then slams the pitcher of water down. After she walks away we ask for the manager and after about five minutes the manager shows. We explain to her why we would like to leave and just then here comes our server with our food. We tell the manager we will stay and pay because it's already here.   At this point the service didn't get much better and all we managed to do was anger the server. I sat there looked at my french toast, took a bite and wondered \"How you can mess up french toast?\" One of my friends ordered fish and chips. He stated that the fish was over cooked and very bland.  I can't say enough negative about this restaurant. Looking at the other reviews it obviously wasn't just an off day for them, this is their norm. After receiving our bill for our over priced and bland food, I felt it was necessary to tip our server, one cent. I feel that leaving one penny is worse than no tip at all. I hope one day she realizes she's in the hospitality industry and tries to make a nicer experience for her customers.   Two Tips for you: 1. DO NOT EAT HERE. 2. Yelp before you leap.",

The salad I had as an appetizer was perfectly fine, but how much is a good house salad really worth!??  Anyway, if you're in Paris and looking for a place to eat, I think it's safe to say that there are probably better places that you can eat at.",

The service has been excellent two out of the three times, and the food has been excellent all 3.   We have ordered: *Steak au Poivre (peppered steak) and the pom frites with asparagus (we LOVED this) *The 3 course meal with French onion soup, filet migon, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and cheesecake. *Chicken fingers  *French Onion Soup al la carte.   We have also ordered lattes at their side bar while not dining at the restaurant several times.   The ambiance is fun, as it looks like a French cafe, and if you sit outside there is plenty of opportunity for people watching. As I said, the service was great two out of the three times. Once the waitress just seemed a bit clueless, but the food was still good.   I recommend this place to anyone looking for a middle of the road priced place with pretty decent food and a fun, sorta romantic atmosphere.",

This is absolutely ridiculous!  Since I knew my order would be a lot for me to finish, I split it without asking for an extra plate.  The pancakes come on their own plate separate from the rest of the food, so it's easy to share without seeing that extra charge on the bill :)",

My girlfriend and I were attracted by the advertised special of filet mignon dinner (complete with soup/salad) for $17.  The soup was a creamy chicken vegetable which reminded me of Thanksgiving, and it would have been pretty good had it not been luke-warm.  The filet mignon came with a hollandaise sauce, roasted potatoes and some steamed asparagus and green beans.  The filet had nice grill marks, which inspired some hope, but it was over-cooked, under-seasoned, and it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.  The potatoes were pretty tasty, but the veggies were under-seasoned as well.  We also ordered some mushroom crepes.  These were the best thing about the meal, but not by far, and I am not exactly a crepe expert.  They tasted similar to the soup to me.  Perhaps some cross-pollination going on?  The proximity to our hotel elevators and a friendly (albeit somewhat inattentive) waiter helped redeem some value on the experience, but all-in-all, I think I could have executed the meal better in my own kitchen.  Bottom line: There are lots of great restaurants in Vegas, so, unless you are trying to avoid long lines at the dinner rush, you may want to consider more options.",

    "text": "As a Las Vegas resident, I generally avoid restaurants on the Las Vegas strip both because local restaurants often offer better value and because of the traffic hassle. However, we needed to meet relatives who were staying at the Paris and had just experienced a 6 hour delayed flight. It seemed only courteous to meet them where they were staying after all of the travelling they had done.   We made a reservation for seven people for 7:45pm on a Friday night, but apparently not a real busy Friday night. We arrived in three parties and thankfully were seated as we arrived. We ate \"inside\" rather than on the \"outside\" near the casino floor. This was a thankfully quiet place where we could all hear each other. The next plus was that the bread that was served was good chewy bread rolls, and unfortunately, freshly baked good bread is often not served in Las Vegas.  Three of us had the peppercorn steak. One rated it 8 out of 10, I thought the sauce could have been more subtle; the third person liked the sauce. One of us had the French dip and declared it excellent. Two had the duck a la orange; one thought the duck too lean, another liked it. The person who ordered the beef in wine sauce liked it and the person who ordered the omlette said is was okay. Service was good, there was never a need to catch the waiter's eye.   With one of us ordering an appetizer and no one rushing through dinner, the meal lasted an hour and a quarter. To me, when you get together with relatives from out of town the meal should be a leisurely occasion. I see the speed of service is a constant source of debate in Las Vegas dining. Some people want to get in out quickly, others like myself resent a waiter asking, \"Are you still working on that, sir?\"   For me the restaurant served its purpose well: A nice quiet place to have a leisurely family meal with no one rushing us and reasonably good food and excellent service.",

    "text": "Ridiculous!  Came here for breakfast before hitting the strip. After pondering over the menu, I opted for the corned beef and hash with eggs. $12.99.  A short time later, this bemoth of a plate comes out, completely covered with great quality corned beef and hash, with two overeasy eggs! Really, looked like something out of the Flinstones or something. And it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.   The downside here was the service: Friend asks for an Iced Americano. Out comes some iced coffee contraption with cream. Asked for water, had to ask 3 times.  Service needs help, but food quality makes up for it.",

    "text": "Background: I went there for breakfast with friends on a Saturday morning. I had a pretty typical breakfast - eggs, sausage, toast, and a croissant.  The good: The food was OK but not great. We were seated relatively quickly even though there was a line.  The bad: The service was pretty horrible. It took them a while just to take our order. We finished our drinks well before breakfast arrived and nobody came by to offer any refills or to check on us. After a long wait, food did show up. They got my order wrong, however, so that required some fixing.  Once we'd eaten, they brought the check, but didn't give us a pen to sign anything with. There was an iPod Touch embedded in the bill folder, but it seemed to serve no useful purpose as it could be turned on and unlocked, but had no applications installed. Perhaps it would have been useful if we had paid with a credit card.  In any case, the food is nothing special and the service is pretty awful.",
