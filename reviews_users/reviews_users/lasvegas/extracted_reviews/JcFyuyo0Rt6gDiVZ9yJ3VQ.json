We ordered two of the freshly squeezed juices, (the Get Skinny - which is poorly named because of all the sugary fruits in it, and the Green Zen. Both juices seemed like they added water to fill them up. Definitely not worth 7 bucks. I asked what kind of juicer they used (centrifugal or cold pressed) they girl making didn't know. The protein bowls were watery from quinoa that was not cooked to completion. They add Chimichurri but the flavor is lacking in the bowls. I've eaten here 3 times now and this is probably my last.",

You have to pick out the items you want and then there is an option to customize the item.  Then you place the order and when it comes you are presented with a check.  I don't know about most people but I want to order and eat rather than learn how they want you to order.  Despite these flaws in execution, the service was slow and very poor.  The food quality was fairly good but the coffee I ordered was cold by the time I got it.  I will not be back unfortunately!",

Price point is great - spend $10 for a super healthy, fresh meal...or spend $7 at some fast food joint or the chinese spot or bad Italian place in the same shopping center, this place is a no brainer.  Outstanding service (even given the weird tablet order format, which is cool once you get used to it), delicious, fresh, healthy food, and the best part of it all:  a reasonable price point!  This kind of place is something that Summerlin as a whole, and especially this area with so many active people, has been missing out on for some time.  I rarely gush about anywhere, my reviews can attest to this, but I think this place is going to become a serious mainstay and the concept is outstanding.  As far as the food, my first time there I got the shrimp bowl which was good.  The portions were dead on for what it should be, the meal delicious.  My girlfirend picked up a sandwich (can't recall what it was) that I had a bite of and it was great as well.  Total came out to like $21?  Not bad!  Came in for lunch today and spent $10 for the steak bowl, which was outstanding.    Highly recommended (although some may take some time to get used to the tablet ordering thing)",

The location is great, especially since it's really close to red rock canyon. The only reason for the 2 star review was the service. We ordered 2 salmon burgers and 2 large shakes. The prices were higher than your usual wraps or burgers but I guess it's all because of the quality of food. We got our salmon burger right away and one of the shakes. It took about 30 mins and 3 follow ups to get the second shake. There weren't that many people and there were 3 servers. About 4 people got their drinks before us and about 3 of them had their orders wrong. By the time we got the 2nd drink, we were almost done with our meal. It's a shame because the food was really good but with the price I'm paying, I don't think I'll be back to get that type of service. They did try to compensate by giving a free drink after handing the 2nd drink but I don't think there were no care or sincerity in their side (they weren't rude or anything, just didn't give a f**k). The fact that we had to keep reminding them with the order and kept forgetting it was the deal breaker. I hope they fix their service ASAP because the food and concept is really great and I would like to comeback again but it won't be anytime soon.",

There wasn't much for veggies...overall not much food. The green sauce was excellent.  The chicken dish was good - same thing not much veggies and not much food.   The shake was awful - tasted like just ice  I love the iPad idea was really cool - I like how you could adjust for what you wanted right there.

We found that rude and unprofessional. The manager was dressed in sloppy clothes  (no uniform) with a mess of hair like she just rolled out of bed.   Regarding the cleanliness, every table was dirty. All of the iPads were filthy. The ice tea dispenser was horrid. We came in the morning so there's no reason that everything shouldn't have been clean at the start of the day. As we sit here, two girls are standing around talking instead of cleaning. If the public area looks like this I'm scared to think what the kitchen looks like.   Now the food, it was good/ok.

My side salad that came with my sandwich was just spring mix with a few drops of vinaigrette.   My fiancee who got a full size salad and hates dressings in general asked For more dressing because her salad was also \"dry\". The salmon on her salad looked appetizing and I don't like seafood. But again mostly spring mix with a few pistachios and whatever else was listed on her salad.   My sandwich was a lot smaller than the picture online.  The picture are close up and make it look huge.  The only thing huge was the super thick bun which was a little dry and stale. We were there near closing on a weekend so that could account for the staleness of the bun.

I ordered the steak Cesar wrap and it was so bland. The steak was a little tough also. I had to drown my wrap with hot sauce and dressing to get the flavor going. What's up with the rock hard croutons? It didn't compliment the wrap at all and kept getting in the way of my chewing.  When we were finishing up with our meal, the guy came over to give us the check and he waited. Okay my friend wasn't back from the bathroom and so I told him to wait.

The fusion flavors here ( e.g. teriyaki soy, chimichurri ) makes eating superfoods like kale and quinoa less out of spite to your own stomach and more like a great tasting meal you look forward to eat.  My favorite here is the breakfast steak protein plate: medium rare steak cubes, 2 poached eggs, fresh onions, cucumber, squash, mushroom, and kale.  I prefer to sub out the quinoa for an extra serving of veggies and ask for the chimichurri sauce on the side for even less carbs.",

Choices include smoothies, freshly pressed juices, wraps, bowls, and sandwiches. There are also some dessert items such as the gluten-free brownie.   On this visit, I had the ahi poke salad (new!) and it was yummy. I also recommend the Skinny juice if you want something tangy and refreshing.  The cool thing about Krayvings is that there is a tablet on each table, which lets you customize and electronically order your meal. The downside to this ordering method is that you have to share the tablet or take turns with it. It's not that big of a deal if you are just a party of two like we were, but it might be a little difficult with a group.   Other than that, Krayvings is a good place to grab a healthy bite. Taylor was our waitress and she's awesome :) Check it out if you're in the Summerlin area!",

Here's the rundown:  Immune Plus Juice (Small - $6.25) Made on the spot with orange, carrot, ginger, and lemon. This was refreshing.  Bison Burger On Fresh Brioche Bun ($10.50): Bland. It certainly needed more of the caramelized onions for a flavor boost.  The patty was thick, small, and crumbled when I bit into it. Definitely not as delicious as their turkey burger, which is a best seller.   Chips cost $2. An inflated price tag for a bag that's inflated with 90% air.   The food here is hit or miss for me; though, the fresh juices and smoothies haven't let me down.",

I expected way more flavor and volume for a salad that cost $12. The wrap was pretty good but it was really the dressing that gave it flavor and nothing else.",

    "text": "After working out Saturday morning, a friend and I wanted somewhere healthy to eat. She suggested Krayvings and I am so glad she did. I had the bison burger and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had! It was juicy and flavorful and the burger had nothing on it but carmelized onions, lettuce and tomato. Sometimes sauce is not the boss! My burger came with a small side salad with some kind of vinaigrette on it that was very light and tasty. My friend had the kale and beet salad with chicken which she seemed to really enjoy. We were going to try the guilt-free chocolate smoothie which is made with nutella, greek yogurt, honey, almond butter, and chocolate almond milk, but we decided to save that for our next visit. Doesn't it sound soo good though??   I LOVE the ordering system here. All around the restaurant and at each table are tablets that have pictures of all the items on the menu. You just press what you want to order, and then you can customize it to your liking. Note, the tablet does not include descriptions of items, so it's best to grab a paper menu as well so you can read what each sandwich/wrap/salad contains. Once you know what you want, you press order and that sends the order to the kitchen to be prepared. Then shortly after you order, someone comes by to collect payment and not long after that they bring out the food. Such a cool concept! I will be back to try some of the other selections they have on the menu.  Yelp 2015 Review #39",

I've never had anything I didn't like but my personal favorites are the chicken and quinoa bowl and the BBQ chicken salad. My husband really likes their PB and J protein shake.

Although still not a fan, I guess it's manageable enough. I had a question and requested assistance, and they came right over, which is good.  I tried the sesame chicken wrap this go around. I found it to be very tasty, with a generous amount of chicken and a side salad, too.  On a previous visit I had ordered the tuscan chicken(?), and I found there to be too little chicken and too much bread!  This wrap was prepared properly and was quite good.  Another reason for the upgrade is that when the food was ready, it was brought over to me, but unlike last time, I went to the register to pay, rather than getting a check like in a restaurant. Good improvement.  Keep in up guys, and I'll be back!",

They have gluten free bun and tortilla option for their sandwiches and wraps. HOWEVER you have to order off of an iPad type tablet which is confusing and takes much longer than just ordering from an employee. And the gluten free bun option was not available on the sandwich we wanted to order. We notified the employees of this and they made us wait while they attempted to add the option to their electronic system. The whole ordeal took like 15min I wish someone would have just taken our order we were trying to get something quick before our drive back to CA! My aunt had the same problem trying to order a gluten free bun. The staff told her to select the gf tortilla option but they would put it on a bun. When our food came out it was on a tortilla but we didn't have time to ask them to correct it. My mom got the Krayvings club and the bite I took of it was pretty delicious. The green apple slice was a nice touch and they give you a good amount of meat! The side salad is just lettuce and salad dressing. I ordered a juice, carrot celery lemon and ginger. I order this same thing at nekter all the time and the sweetness of the carrot makes it really delicious however it turned out awful here! The lemon was over powering and I did not taste the ginger or carrot at all! This was probably partly my fault bc I tried to customize my own drink instead of sticking with the immune + juice that includes orange and the employee was nice enough to remake it for me. I asked to leave out the lemon the second time and it was still disappointing. The juice looked slightly orange but I couldn't taste the carrot or ginger. Overall, I was disappointed with the service and the amount of time it took us to order. The quality of the food seemed hit or miss, I really liked the sandwich but the salad and juice was disappointing. I really wanted to like this place bc of the healthy and gluten free options but it's a little too expensive for the quality of service and mistakes that were made on our order.",

Large glass jars filled with chilled cucumber water (free of charge), various teas~not only look like a magazine ad, but add a perfect display of thirst quenchers.  Great concept, food and atmosphere!",

I couldn't eat the whole thing just half as it was huge and did kind of getting boring. I felt it was missing something, but can't put my finger on it. Also the salad that came on the side had a light oil maybe vinegrette on the side it was perfect just enough and fresh! My sister got the vegan chili it was packed with fresh veggies and she has no complaints. My mom got the bodybuilder breakfast; 3 egg whites, and two pretty big sized turkey patties. Hers was nothing to write home about, pretty boring if you ask me. I would come back if I was trying to be health conscious or as an after hike meal; but wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the area sure!!!",

My favorite part about this restaurant is that it's a seat yourself, order on the table tablet, and wait for the food to come place. I feel like a lot of people are confused by how the ordering system works because so many people order at the front counter. But to avoid the hassle make sure you just take advantage of the tablets on the table because it's really easy to just customize and order all of your food or smoothies or juices from there!   As far as the food goes I love their baby kale sweet potato feta wrap! It's my go-to and it isn't too expensive. Their juices are great but they are pricey.

You sit down, look through the digital or paper menu, place your order, and submit payment when one of the employees visits your table.  I liked the freshness to their availabilities.  By looking at the ingredients you can tell they focus on \"fresh\" and \"raw\".  It's a healthy menu option without the sacrifice of taste.    With las vegas being a smaller city geography, one would think that it is not worth it to drive to the outskirts for this place.  In my opinion, it's worth it.

They taste great and you're actually able to feed your kids something healthy that they'll actually eat! My kids had the pizza and pancakes (had a lot of strawberries and blueberries on top). They ate all that plus the chicken in my Caesar chicken wrap - which I liked a lot too.  I've been to Krayvings a bunch of times and I will def keep coming back.",

I ordered the shrimp bowl and added avocado. It had quinoa and kale and everything was steamed perfectly and didn't seem over cooked.   Over all this place is a good choice if you're heading up to Red Rock for a hike and want something healthy.",

    "text": "After reading tons of great reviews from this joint, we decided to give this place a try despite of having LYFE Kitchen right around my neighborhood.  Being situated near Red Rock Casino at the northwest side of town, it actually took a good 45 minute drive so I probably won't see myself going here as much.  This establishment, however, would be a great pit stop for those who often hike at Red Rock Canyon due to its location.  Concept is quite similar to any typical healthy restaurants throughout the valley that serve great alternatives for greasy mediocre food.  Only complaint was the lack of seasoning!!  I don't know if it were just the tofu bowl I ordered, but the dish seemed like a bunch of steamed vegetables begging for dressing/sauce to give it some flavor; took about a quarter of Sriracha bottle and several dashes of Tabasco to make it somewhat palatable.  One awesome detail about this place: tablets on each table as the ordering mechanism.  I thought it was dope how the menu includes an image of each item and even allows everybody to customize their own dish.  Downside, however, was that it took us fifteen minutes more than what it should've taken just to get our food ordered.  Overall, Krayvings is a great place especially for those who prefer healthy eating.  Great ambiance and superb customer service.  Will definitely give this place another try in the near future.",

Prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food you are getting. They were pretty quick and staff was pleasant. The place itself is cute as well. My only suggestion would be some kind of a rewards program.

My friend had the salmon bowl, which was a larger portion than expected. I had the turkey burger, which was tasty, but didn't leave me too full.   My only suggestion is that, for a restaurant that emphasizes it's menu is based on health, it would be nice to have had nutritional info for the items, even if only provided for the sauces they use (since us health nuts pretty much have calories memorized for most things lol).",

    "text": "Hello management at Krayvings. As you are aware the easy task of getting someone in the door is not so easy but the harder task of getting to come back makes your job as an owner or manager of a reasturant that much harder. So I talked my wife to goto your reasturant on a Sunday night. Not busy at all. We also had our kids. First time in a long time we experienced the bring out the children's food before the adults food. Don't do that unless you ask or are asked. We end up with two kids who want to go and I can not enjoy my meal.  Once I realized that out food had not been made yet I was watching the chefs cook. My item a Turkey sausage power bowl with quinoa two poached eggs and chimchuri sauce (sounds good right?) gets placed under the heat lamps. I think ok waiting on my wife's food a 3 egg omelet with feta, broccoli, spinach and avocado.  As a side note your reasturant has a great idea for ordering via the tablet. My wife's omelet was not supposed to have tomatoes. We took it off via the app and the guy who helped us get settled came out and confirmed my wife's order the old fashioned way. Omelet came out with tomatoes. Arty the guy who confirmed the order must have caught it, but wasn't remade the cook picked off the tomatoes. Last complaint is you may want to buy a liquid egg because a 3 egg omelet is not going as far as it used to. The only redeeming quality of your staff was Arty? Had the omelet remade by the looks of it via an argument with the chef. Back to my order finally got it nice and cold. I should have sent it back but by this time I was just ready to kill the kids. Get it together Krayvings. You have a great concept, looks like good quality food but an epic bad night.  Good Luck  May come back on my own to try you again.",

I don't even like BBQ sauce, but they seem to go light on the sauce which works for me!  I deviated once and ordered a shrimp protein bowl, but I just wasn't feeling it and was left regretting my decision to skip the wrap. It just wasn't flavorful enough.   The pineapple mojito juice is the yummiest.  I have to take away one star for the quality of take out. Maybe it was an outlier, but everything just seemed sloppily made. They aren't consistent with the extra serrano either.",

It looked like you could still go to the counter, though.  I had the protein bowl and it was full and FLAVORFUL. I felt like it would be hit or miss with my order. I also got their \"Skinny\" juice - also very flavorful and fresh.  A little pricey, but totally worth it - a good spot for friends or small meetings.",

We thought we'd just had a bad experience with the poor customer service, but after the food poisoning, we will never be back or recommend to others.   On the customer service side of this review, the girl behind the counter(short with black hair) was extremely rude and when delivered our food to the table, literally tossed it on the table without a word to us. The salad didn't have any dressing, so I went inside to ask for some. Without any response, she pulled a container of dressing and plopped it on the counter. I asked what kind was it and she was very short and rude answering me. My husband and I are very nice people, and it isn't that hard to be polite. Not sure why anyone would be in the customer service business if they can't use manners at their job. I would be embarrassed if I were her.   Overall, food poisoning plus rude service workers equals poor rating and wouldn't be surprised if it goes out of business soon.",

    "text": "We had dinner at Krayvings with the family dog last night.  It's located down the paved walkway between the John Cutter and Toros Restaurants and can sometimes be hard to see from the parking lot if you're not looking closely.   We find ourselves here about once a month for lunch or dinner and like to enjoy our food outside on the patio when the weather allows. For us it's the healthiest restaurant close to home so when we are feeling like a \"fit day\" we jog down here, eat a healthy meal, then jog home.  The website describes itself as \"the healthiest and final spot before you enter Red Rock Canyon and the first spot to get rehydrated after a long day of hiking, biking, or sightseeing\"  and as such this restaurant offers super healthy meals with super fresh ingredients and pack their plates with protein whenever possible. They have an impressive menu of fresh fruit and vegetable juices and smoothies to go along with your wellness friendly entree.  As a vegetarian, I always order the Tofu Protein Plate with quinoa. It's served with a sesame teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, and fresh vegetables. The vegetables are only lightly cooked, which I usually dislike, but with this dish are actually tasty. With this restaurant being as health-centric as they are in my mind the under cooked vegetables are intentional to retain nutrient properties of the food.  For the past handful of visits my husband has ordered the Steak Caesar Salad. Though caesar salad is traditionally served with chicken, he says the steak is cooked perfectly and delicious and actually pairs well with the rest of the salad.  Ordered a \"B12\" juice for us and a bison burger patty for the dog. The B12 juice was made from apple, lime, ginger, kale, and orange and was really tasty.  I'd definitely get it again.  The bison burger appeared to be moist and juicy for the dog.  For Vegas standards, they close fairly early and are only open till 8:00 daily.",

What first got me hooked to this place was their on the go breakfast wrap combo (filled with egg whites, sweet potatoes, avocado, tomato, & light cream cheese w/ chimichurri sauce - SOOO DELICIOUS!) which includes a juice or smoothie for only about $8!   Second, their turkey burgers are AMAZING! Super delicious, very filling & topped with avocado - what more could you want?! Lol   I also love the fact that you can just seat yourself and each table includes a tablet where you can order yourself and they bring the food to your table.   Another thing that I like about this place is that they're super dog friendly and have a patio for you and your pup!  Definitely put your number in for the rewards system to stock up points (every 5 points you can get a free juice or smoothie!) and even get emails of their daily deal which includes BOGO or half off items! I take advantage of this deal like 2-3 times a week!  MUST TRY if you're looking for some good and healthy food to eat in the Summerlin area and even before and after hiking at Red Rock.",

When I want a healthy-ish option or after a morning hike I love coming here. My FAVORITE dish is the Steak Caesar Wrap and comes with a side salad! It's so good. I've had friends try other things but I'm happy  with the Steak wrap. The chicken is good too. Join the rewards program and sign up with your email. They do deals through out the week! There's tables inside and outside. Staff is always nice and the owner is very friendly! If you enjoy smoothies they have a list of options. Defiantly give it a try! Can order dine-in or pick up.",

I can assure you I will be staying at the Red Rock Hotel more often just to be close to Kravings.   What did it for me was the steak protein bowl (add extra steak) and a delicious pineapple mojito followed by a chocolate chip cookie. All very reasonably priced.   The staff was courteous and friendly, the ordering system a breeze. The goods news for me is they are opening a second location in Phoenix very soon. Another city I have to travel to for work.",

Salmon \"burger\" is just flakes of grilled salmon with lettuce on a brioche bun, which is not exactly a healthy bread choice, and that preparation has no business calling itself a burger. Very disappointing. Buffalo burger was bland and cooked to hockey puck consistency. Side \"salad\" is lazily chopped, way too large for a fork romaine lettuce and nothing else. Looked like someone just threw a fist full of lettuce I to a tray. Food shows no care in preparation or originality and is very poorly executed. Most of the menu is the same item in Chipotle or BBQ sauce as either a salad, wrap, or burger, so the large seeming menu is in truth very limited. Will never order here again. I don't understand any of the good reviews here.",

My uncle brought his dog so we all sat in the patio area where our order was taken. The staff was very friendly and even provided my uncle's dog with some water.   I ordered the Turkey Burger (10.25) with the side salad and a cup of water (w/ cucumber and lemon). My uncle and his friend ordered the BBQ Chicken Wrap (10.8) and the Mediterranean Turkey Sandwich (10.5). They both enjoyed their meals !!!   We all felt that the meals were just right. It didn't fill you up too much (to the point of getting sleepy), but it also didn't leave you feeling dissatisfied. It really is \"Feel Good Food!\" Your order generally comes with a side salad, but you can always switch it with sweet potatoes!  I will definitely come back to this place!",

This one is located in 11770 W Charleston Blvd and they're open 8a-9p M-F and 7a-9p Sa-Sun. They have plenty of parking being that it's in a shopping center. I'm always looking for great places to eat for a good price and healthy at the same time. I feel like most healthy places, you pay for it.   The menu is pretty simple like wraps, smoothies, salads and sandwiches. Price range is about $7 - $13 for most things on the menu. Here's the link to there menu.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.krayvings.com%2Fmenu.php&s=7e87b63b8dc4218439d79b954a52b15d72ac80be9710b91f7867fe8c3918130b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">krayvings.com/menu.php</a>  The staff is nice and they explained everything very well when we told him that it was our first time. You can order your things write from your table if you wanted to from a touch screen device. This might not be at all locations. We didn't really have to wait too long either. We went around lunch time on a weekday.   My girlfriend order the BBQ Chicken wrap ($11.49) and I ordered the Acai bowl. The wrap was a nice size that you can easily share with someone. It was really good. I loved it! The acai bowl was a little watery for my taste. I'm from Hawaii and there's a lot of great acai bowl places so I have a high expectation when it comes to them.   Overall, the place is good and if you're looking for a nice places to eat healthy and it won't hurt your wallet, go check this place out.",

    "text": "Great little casual place to stop into when you're coming from a day of hiking around at Red Rocks. The food and juice here is healthy (with many vegetarian, protein, and gluten free diet options), but you don't leave feeling like an anorexic rabbit.   I recommend the beet juice (which tasted pretty damn fresh) and the breakfast sandwich (egg white, tomato and ham) that actually comes on a waffle. The waffle has the option of being gluten free, if that gives you any idea of the type of place this is. Maybe the illusion of health is merely that, but nothing gave us a stomach ache and we felt decently about ourselves after.  One thing to point out about Krayvings is that you order from a tablet at your table (triggering any germophobia I might harbor), but then you pay at the cash register at the end of the counter? ... I think. The experience overall, even though it's meant to be a simple one, therefore seems a little confusing or convoluted and tipping system is possibly even more of a conundrum. Overall, though, who cares!? The service was friendly and I'll always support good food and small business!",

The person who rang us in, Daniel, tried to charge more than the special and a manager came over to help. We asked the manager to make sure the burger did not hand tomatoes or onions. The burger came out before our smoothie with everything on it. We sent it back and still waited for our smoothie. 15 to 20 minutes went by and we still didn't get the smoothie. The smoothie was finally got to us and Daniel brought it over. I asked him if it had protein because I paid for it and he barked at me YES and walked away. The burger finally came back and this time it had nothing on it. At that point my wife and I were completely turned off by the service and everyone there and left. The management at the time were not helpful nor were they apologetic.  Talked to Marty the GM the next day and he was extremely apologetic and thanked us for calling. Marty emphasized that our business and comments were extremely appreciated.",

The chicken caesar wrap is so delicious, and my go-to for a healthy dinner is the chicken protein plate, which has grilled chicken, steamed veggies, served over quinoa. It's so yummy and doesn't make you feel bad about eating out. My favorite dessert is the orange crush smoothie, it's delicious and satisfies my sweet tooth!   I think for what you are getting, the prices are fair. I have to be honest, I really don't love their method of ordering... they use Samsung Galaxy tablets, which are slow and not always charged. I think the concept is great but the execution needs help... but the staff is really great about taking your order manually if that's what you want to do. Everyone there is just so friendly!  HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for a healthy meal at a decent price!",

The sandwiches come with a side salad, the salads are large, and the smoothies are both filling and tasty.  I've tried the sesame salad and a kale shake so far.  But the wraps looked worth a try for my next dining experience.  With so many healthy options popping up in Vegas, especially in the Summerlin area, it's tough to choose a favorite.  Krayvings is tasty and filling and their food packs a punch, but it is also a little more expensive than even other healthy options in town.  But remember, the food is healthy and filling and portions are large.  Give it a try.",

    "text": "I was super excited to try Krayvings since there's not many \"health food restaurants\" around town. Even though it was still 15 minutes from my house I figured I would try it.  Finding it was a bit difficult, has a super small sign by another large restaurant so just look out for it!  When we came in we were greated by a nice employee who showed us how to order (on a tablet) and was extremely nice and helpful! I liked this because we could take our time figuring out what we wanted to eat and didn't feel rushed at all. However, it was a bit confusing while ordering hoping that our changes and add-ons went through correctly and for one of our meals, it did not. Which wasn't a big deal so we didn't ask to change it.   My boyfriend got the steak caesar wrap with the side salad. Hardly any steak, which didn't have much flavor and it was mostly lettuce. The \"side salad\" was just some greens with a dressing. You would think for a health food place they could have made the side salad just a little more ... va va voom.  I got the turkey burger which was full of flavor. I opted for the sweet potato mash (an extra $2) and it was very good. However, I noticed that the brioche bun was grilled in butter. What!? First off, I figured the turkey burger would come on a healthier bun and definitely NOT grilled with butter.   For a place that advertises HEALTHY FOOD, I expected that everything would be healthy and I wouldn't have to worry about getting a non-healthy option.  They also do not provide nutrition guides so you CAN make sure that your food is in fact, healthy and low calorie or whatever it is that you're aiming for with your health needs.  Cool idea and atmosphere but the place definitely needs some changes if it wants to ensure healthy foods with great flavors.",

My super healthy chicken bowl was less than $10 and I could only eat half of it.  They have only been open a couple of weeks, so I wasn't expecting them to have it so together, but they exceeded my expectations. I will definitely return.",

Maybe because they just opened a few days ago? I ordered the daily detox juice & the shrimp superfood protein bowl -- Yuuum!

I ordered off this screen, careful to omit any items that would not fit within my dietary restrictions. However, they did miss a line in my request and kept the sauce that I wanted omitted. I did not complain or send the food back as it was not a severe issue and I'd rather not waste the food, but it was unfortunate seeing as the options are there to modify the food per request. If I'm in the area, I will probably give them another chance... but I will probably order directly at the counter. Sometimes the personal touch is best!",

We were the only two people inside the restaurant and not once did the staff of 4 come and ask us if we were ok or inform us our order never processed and was not received by them. Instead they stood there and talked amongst themselves. One gentleman did pop over to tell us or order would be up shortly. However, after waiting about another 10 minutes, my boyfriend finally went up to ask them how much longer the wait would be and that's when they shared that they never received our order. Thanks to this closing staff for wasting my night. I'm currently on a juicing cleanse and only eating vegan, you were one of the few places to choose from and I made a wrong choice tonight. So disappointing especially since my first visit there went so well.",

    "text": "Cycling around, and exploring Summerlin last weekend, I discovered Krayvings thanks to you Yelpers.  Right up my alley on the menu was the Salmon with Brown Rice and Veggies.  Coconut Sauce on the side as a sub for the BBQ that comes with it.  ($12.00)    I took a big chance--ordering Salmon in a place that I have never been to but the  Salmon was excellent.  Next day, after more cycling and exploring and some shopping in Summerlin, it was time for dinner. Where to go?  I looked at other places on Yelp, and guess where I went?  Back to Krayvings again!  Not sure it was legal to dine in the same restaurant 2 days in a row in Nevada, but I entered, did not say anything, just ordered, and they did not say anything either,--so I was safe.  Guess what I ordered this time?  Yup!   Salmon with Brown Rice and Veggies with Coconut sauce on the side.  Salmon was excellent.  Service is Summerlin friendly=friendly. Quick delivery to table--approx 15 minutes. Bathroom was clean. Tables clean. Serve yourself water very good and cold. Car Parking easy and free. Bike parking easy in the back of store. Store has a positive vibe. Value=very good.  Wish list to owner--Brown rice was good, but the not the best I have ever had--experiment with ones that retain their moisture and flavor a bit more.  Usually found in Asian restaurants. A great brown rice enhances the taste of the fish even more.    I will be back here next time in Summerlin--hopefully soon.  PS  If you are cycling the Red Rocks--great place for lunch and relaxing when you come back to civilization.",

When people think healthy food, they think salads and granola bars (which is actually not that good for you because store-bought granola bars are super high in sugar)...UGGGHHHH!!! Healthy shouldn't mean bland, boring, sad, and cardboard-tasting food. It is letting the natural delicious flavors and textures from each ingredient to shine without having to hide them in salt or sugar.  They have offerings for those that eat vegetarian, spicy, high protein, or gluten-free diets. Sure, they have salads but they have more than just that. Freshly-squeezed juices, protein smoothies, plates high in protein, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, and sweet treats. They also have items for kids if you have some of those. Don't know what you want? They have menu recommendations (best seller, staff favorite, and kid choice award). Whatever your goal is or whatever your diet creed is - they have something for you. Mine would be to consume 2500-3000 calories/day (from healthy sources) just to maintain weight, and I could easily do that if I spent a whole day eating here.  Your choice of proteins include: shrimp, salmon, tofu, chicken, turkey, bison, poached egg, and steak. I've tried their sandwiches and all-day breakfast. But my favorites are...  Steak & Egg Protein Plate: Grilled steak, poached eggs, quinoa, basil, red onions, chimichurri, mushrooms, and veggies. DELISH! You get the herby taste from the basil, crunch from the carrots and zucchini, creaminess from the yolk (poached egg). Lots of flavors and nutrients. 5/5  Mediterranean Turkey: Turkey, roasted red pepper, grapes, avocado, lettuce, cucumber, and yogurt sauce on whole wheat bread, and served with a side salad. At first, I was leery about having grapes in my sandwich because that's the kind of stuff I did when I was little and grossed people out including myself. But mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm...this sandwich is darn good! 5/5  Banana Split Protein Smoothie: I like making my own protein smoothies in the morning because I get to add all my favorite things in there. This smoothie is similar to what I make. It has NUTELLA, strawberries, banana, chocolate almond milk, and kefir (ok, I don't use kefir at home but I think I should). It's sweet and a bit tart. Amazing! 5/5  I've tried their Daily Detox juice which has beets, ginger, orange, apple, and lemon. And because I'm partial against beets and orange - my opinion on this drink doesn't count. My sister loves this though.  I guess you're supposed to use the iPads that are on each table but I've always walked up to the counter to place my order because I'm strange like that.",

Bonus points for being an environmentally conscious business and for having exceptional customer service. They go out of your way to accommodate and ensure everything is right.   Wraps are fresh and tasted like all the ingredients were literally harvested in the back. Had the BBQ chicken wraps, as well as the Roasted Beet & Walnut.   The Roasted Beet & Walnut had a nice crunch from the veggies and crispy green apple. It complimented the sweetness of the beets. I'm not usually thrilled by beets, but this wrap changed my mind. I'm on team beet from now on! The BBQ chicken, on the other hand was the fan favorite though. The chicken was nicely grilled, avocado, with all the fixins.. how can you go wrong? The sauce on both wraps were just the right amount - enough to be flavorful without overpowering the fresh ingredients themselves. The amount of ingredients they skillfully stuff into the wraps are very generous as well. Not only will you be full, but you'll feel great too. The wraps had a light, fresh taste to them - there was no heavy stomach feeling afterwards.   Also! Treat yo self to the chocolate chip cookie. They're not to be missed and only for $1, you can't say no.",

The employees were very welcoming and gave us great recommendations since we took too long to order.  I got the 'Get Skinny' juice made of strawberries, pears, apples, oranges, kiwis, lemons and the pulled chipotle chicken sandwich with a side of greens.  A close friend of mine was able to build her own omelette that catered to her vegetarian lifestyle and everything that we had was quite delicious. This is the type of food that really hits the spot after a wild hike on the Icebox Canyon trail, and I must say that they have a self serve station of water and fruit infused water. But on the day I came, the water was infused with cucumbers and I absolutely love cucumbers (that was definitely +1 star).  Whenever we plan on going hiking at Red Rock Canyon again, I will be sure to come back here (-:",

My husband ordered an Italian sandwich and he said was good as well. Comes with a side salad which was a Spring Mix I believe covered more than half of the plate. For health food it was reasonably priced. Have out door seating but was a little windy/cold to sit outside to eat.",

The steak sandwich has generous, large slices of delicious steak. The bread is great.   Service is great and there is plenty of seating. Awesome juice and smoothie options. There is a sweet potato cheesecake I hope to try. I will be returning to this place as often as I can.",

We ordered the chicken strawberry salad, a chicken wrap, kids mac n' cheese, and kid's pizza.  EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME!  The salad was large and topped with so much chicken and strawberries, which paired well with the dressing that came on the side.  I tore into the chicken wrap; loved some of the black beans in the wrap.  The mac n' cheese was also delicious and green apple wedges were a nice touch.  The pizza was really good!  It was on a flat bread with a tangy sauce and plenty of cheese.  We were also invited to try the chinese chicken salad, which was out of the world good!  The chocolate banana smoothie was such a treat, thank you!!  Love the brewed ice tea! Only recommendation... lemonade in the soft drink section?",

I did so and he offered no further instruction or assistance so I got the gist and began to look through their electronic menu, which as an Android and Apple App and graphic designer I can say is not very intuitive at all, I placed and order and sent it to the kitchen. I waited patiently. Very patiently. We assumed or drinks would be delivered to us as with most restaurants but here that is not the case. You actually have to go and and grab your own cup and drink from the fountain after you place your order so after waiting 20 minutes for our food to arrive, parched, we asked about our drinks, which usually come before your meal, only then did someone think to mention that to us. Perturbed at how long our order took them on such a slow evening in the restaurant I ravenously started in to my tofu teriyaki bowl. It was delicious. Although it was cold. Yes. Cold in most spots like it had been microwaved. I complained and waited. I received my bowl within just a few short minutes. I politely made a formal complaint to the host about the whole experience and said the food was great but they really need to work on their service. After that we got our bill, now I can't say I didn't expect but wouldn't everyone agree with me that most places will take off at least a drink or two but especially an ill prepared meal off the tab? Well not in this case. The apology for their lackluster service was as lackluster and the bill was full charge. I was so turned off by this place that I will not be going out of my way again for it not suggesting it to anyone else. Maybe I got the night shift people on a slow week day that through them off but that's no excuse. Try harder guys.",

My issue is with the juices... $11.25 for fresh pressed pesticides.  You cannot charge that much for a juice made with conventional (NON organic) produce and position yourself as a health conscious restaurant catering to that clientele.  People who can afford a $12 juice are smart enough to care where this guy sources his ingredients from.  Also worth noting that the meat is not organic either, so the whole concept is a little off for me.",

    "text": "So...I usually hold off on the reviews until I've tried a place more than a few times. The sad part about this place is that the service is what makes it so bad. The food is and has been amazing, but the staff here DO NOT have it together. When you walk in, there's no acknowledgment. None. Never. Every single time I've been here, which has been more than 5-6 times now, nobody greets you. Forget about getting service if you order online and try to pick up. I've waited more than 5 minutes on 2 occasions and nobody even came up to the counter to see if I needed help. Not only that, they charged me twice on one pick up order and it took about 30 min when I came back to get a refund on it. I had to show the \"supervisor\" my bank statement and online receipt that said it was already paid for AND sent her a copy of it all so she can show the owners. This is for a 20 dollar order. Seriously, I'm not trying to scam them out of 20 dollars. This time, I come 30in after ordering like they suggest and they haven't even started on the order. I can clearly see them shuffling through their order log looking all stupefied. The manager comes and makes it seem like I messed up because \"there was a confusion on the order.\" Only when he realized that I was writing a review did he come and apologize and offer a drink.  I work in the industry as most people in Las Vegas do, and service will always trump the product. This place needs to do some major work on the staff and service before I set foot again.",

    "text": "Good concept, terrible execution!! We placed our lunch order at 12:10. At 12:28 the steak bowl arrived. At 12:40 I went to check on the turkey burger. The cashier said that the only orders she had for our table was for a steak bowl. She sent a server out to the table to check our tablet to see if it was ever placed. The server saw that all the orders were sent successfully but was unsure why it didn't show up on their system.  Her only comment was \"these haven't been working right all day\".  KRAYVINGS:1)  if you know your system is down, be proactive about it and take orders the traditional way. 2) Send a server, hostess, waiter, bus boy, manager (someone) etc, periodically to check on your patrons. The customer shouldn't have to come up and check on their food, they should be getting the update from your establishment. Once the remainder of the food did arrive at 12:50 pm it actually was pretty good.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were traveling from CA to UT last week and stopped here to have lunch as well as purchase something for dinner later as we had a full day of events ahead of us.  We stayed in Vegas for a month last year and were frequent patrons of this place.  Everything we had from here during that month made us feel we were enjoying healthy, quality food.  We looked forward to grabbing some food for the road last week.  Ordered a bowl, his with shrimp, mine with salmon.  Whom ever prepped the quinoa did not wash it and it felt like we were both munching, crunching on sand.  The salmon was not cooked long enough in my bowl.  We were on a tight schedule so tried to eat as much as possible before getting back on the road.  My boyfriend decided something should be said regarding the lack of quality of our food.  The owner happened to be there and tasted the quinoa himself and confirmed it was not good to eat as well as acknowledged the salmon not being cooked.  He was very apologetic and we told him we enjoyed his food so much last year when staying in NV.  Not only did he refund our lunches but refunded our whole bill which also included wraps we planned on eating later, and a pineapple mojito.  It was kind of him to refund the who tab. We thanked him for making things right and we would certainly be returning next time we travel that way.   BTW, the wraps we bought for later that evening were perfect.",

    "text": "I was so excited for this place to open, as there was nothing quick and healthy close by. I've been there twice since it opened and haven't had the best experience either time.  The first time was frustrating because they force you to order off of their iPads, which takes longer than ordering through a person at any other sandwich spot. You have to scroll through all of the items, which at the time had no pictures, and click into each item to read the description. The smoothies are under the drinks menu, and instead of an easy list with descriptions, again you have to look at the pictures, about 6 per page, and keep clicking 'more' until you find one of interest, and then click into it for the description. Once you finally find what you want and you order, you have no idea whether or not it was successfully submitted. You wait for a while and someone brings you a bill. Again, seems like a waste of employee time compared to other places. That visit we had to go back up to the counter to get our drinks and silverware since no one brought them out after we ordered from our table. All in all a confusing process. The food was okay, though I got a vegetable wrap which was basically all kale, a couple garbanzo beans and very few tiny chunks of sweet potatoes. The green smoothie was not very good, and I order green smoothies frequently and love them.  The second visit was meant to be a quick to go order. Since their menu is not online I went in. I again was forced to order from a table and just check the to go option. We saw about ten meals waiting to be distributed, but utter confusion from the staff as to where they were supposed to go and what each dish was, so the meals sat there for quite a while. While that was going on a customer asked to add two bars to his order while he was paying, but the cashier had to ring them up separately as a new order again through the iPad on a table. Just all seems like such a waste of time. The protein bowl that I got was good though, and a decent amount of food for the price. The experience is what will make me steer clear of this place, at least until I can call in an order, in hopes of making it a better experience.",

    "text": "I went there once for lunch and that would be my last visit there as well. The taste of food was not bad, but I don't like how the service was run. First of all, we were told that we just had to order thru the tablet on the table. So I pretty much had not much chance to ask about allergy. I ordered the grilled steak sandwich, the menu on the tablet said the bread is whole wheat bread, so I was OK with the description, but there was nowhere I could note that I wanted my steak well done. So I had to go to the cashier counter and told the guy about my need. And my husband ordered a chicken wrap. After some wait, my steak sandwich came first. And I noticed there were whole seeds on and in the bread. So I paged for someone thru the tablet to ask and confirm. Turned out they were really whole flaxseeds, which I am allergic to. Besides the bread was big and there were a minute amount of steak. So the staff person asked me if I want to change the bread to a wrap. At that point, I was worried not knowing if there is anything I would be allergic to in the wrap, so I asked if I can have the brioche bread instead. So the guy took my plate to the kitchen, and then came back to take care of our bill first with a mobile device. I was a bit unhappy about how he handled it, it was as if I would sneak away after I made a request of changing bread. I saw everyone pay after finishing the meal, why would we have to pay before we even had any bite in our mouth? I didn't want to argue with him as I don't want any spitting on our food. So I paid and still were \"forced\" to pay tip right away before we had eaten anything (he stood right next to me watching me signing the receipt. Later on, the sandwich came and I was even more upset, as the brioche was smaller than the flaxseed wheat bread, they couldn't fit all those steak meat in and took away some. And remember what I said earlier, there were very minute amount of meat to begin with, so taking away some making it as if there was not much left. I didn't want to bother to ask and just finish it, and in the back of my head, I was hoping that no one had spotted on it just because I asked for changing the bread. My husband was upset about my sandwich too. And my husband said there was not much chicken in his wrap either. Anyway, this meal was not just and the meat portion was very unreasonable. It wasn't worth to pay any tip at all for such kind of business, we can hardly call that as service, when most of the time was interacting with the tablet. We will never go back and would not recommend at all!",

It's hard to eat healthy when you're out working sales out on the street all day, and sometimes you find one thing on a menu that works with your vegan diet and you end up going there all the time.  I walked in because I was going to go to Cutter's and get some work done on my laptop, but stepped in here instead.  THANK YOU JEZUS!  LOL Everything Dr Fuhrman says in his books are on this menu - and so close to my house!  YES !  Vegan, here it is... raw? here it is... still want your beef chicken and fish? here it is... and then the juice choices - too much to take in at once...   At least someone is on my side and I get to work here too with wi-fi.    I am that mix of diner that doesn't like the high pressure of some raw places- let me choose.  I love that Wheat Grass Shots are on the menu!  You can tell someone wanted to do this for themselves... and that he's just like us.   Good job guys - 5 stars",

    "text": "So so disappointed in this place. Please be wary of the integrity of the employees and the owner. Here's the story... I've been to this place a few times before and the food has always been very good. I placed a takeout order a few weeks back and requested no Serrano peppers on BBQ wrap. When I got home we discovered finely chopped serranos in the wrap which resulted in my wife being unable to eat the wrap due to the heat of the peppers. I called and let the restaurant know of the mess up. The employee was very nice and apologized and assured me she would write my name down for a free wrap to make up for the mistake. I went in today to take advantage of my free wrap. I ordered, told the employee that I had a free wrap, she smiled said ok and took my order. As I'm waiting the owner comes and introduces himself. I'm thinking he's come to find out what happened and I'm thinking to myself this is good customer service! Come to find out he lets me known whoever I spoke with didn't write my name down in \"the book\" and unless I can show some proof of who I spoke with he would not honor my free wrap. He then proceeded to question my motivation and ask if I had some proof of my visit three weeks ago... Without proof no free sand.... Point of this whole story is this is a horrible way to treat a customer much less a customer whose order you screwed up on.. Not only do you screw up but then you accuse me of lying about it... And this is coming from the owner of the establishment! I hope it was worth it you've lost a customer for life and I will make sure my office NEVER orders lunch from your establishment ! Everyone else reading this should boycott a place that no respect for the customers that make their business.",

    "text": "I've only been three times. My first time was an evening visit and I don't remember all of the staff by name, I only remember Eddie, but they were all nice. We ordered out and for there only being a three or so other tables being served, I thought our order took kind of long to complete. We ordered a smoothie for someone back home and they made that first and gave it to us so it wasn't in the best smoothie shape by the time we got it home. We ordered two different sandwiches, a burger, and a kids grilled chicken with veggies. Everything was quite tasty, we all ready enjoyed what we had so much so we decided it deserved another visit sometime despite the prices.   Our second visit was during a late afternoon. Again we ordered takeout and it took a while but the place was also busy at that time. Staff was a completely different group but still very nice. I had the same sandwich but this time it wasn't as tasty and the bread was a little burnt when they toasted it so it tore the roof of my mouth up...bummer. It's a pet peeve of mine when the food is inconsistent even with different chefs. But my kid enjoyed her pizza so I was happy.  Our third time I ordered the same sandwich lol I had to test the consistency again and unfortunately I've come to the conclusion that maybe the night crew has the better chef. My kid didn't like her Mac and cheese she said it wasn't cheesy...the watery cheese didn't stick to the noodles, it was just a soup at the bottom of the bowl. I tried it and understood, especially since she's growing up on Velveeta haha.  The juice I ordered was alright, I only consumed half of it before it was tossed.    I don't like their self serve drink selection. They have sodas, lemon water and tea. All fine things for older kids & up, but not one option for my 5 year....she doesn't want lemon water, she doesn't drink sodas or tea. She had no option for a drink.   Over all it's just....ehhh, so-so. Prices are....I mean I guess...if I have to.",

It's not cosmic but can be a little cumbersome and time consuming. However, if you are the type to order a specific item then change everything on it and put half of it on-the-side then you will love it. Most annoying to my wife is that when you order a drink, you don't get that drink until your food comes (we always go harass them before that though).   The food is good and ingredients are fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was a good price at $5. Then I got the Mediterranean Turkey and it was $9, plus $1 since I wanted cheese :(     Not heinous but a slightly expensive sandwich.  Nice worker bees. They don't really do a whole lot besides deliver your food so I'm not a huge tipper here. Too bad for them.",

I loved that they used plates made of recycled material. They also had a tablet at each table that you could look at photos of all the menu items and order from there so you're not rushed.

    "text": "My first time at Krayvings and was blown away! I got a Daily Detox juice, the Bison Chili and the Salmon Protein Bowl, plus 1 wheatgrass shot and 1 ginger shot with cayenne pepper.  I started out with just a juice as I was talking with a client of mine and just needed something to drink while we finished our conversation. It was really well balanced and wasn't overpowering with beet flavor like other juices I've had. It felt like it really got my metabolism going, but that also could have been the smells coming from the kitchen while I met with the client.  The chili was really good, spicy but not over the top and the bison was super lean so the chili wasn't super oily or greasy. It was really hot when I got it so I had to let it cool a bit, but once I did I couldn't stop eating it.  The Salmon Protein Bowl was perfect. The fish was cooked perfectly and the BBQ sauce paired really well with the fish, quinoa and the veggies. I will definitely get that again next time.  The shots were surprisingly delicious. Usually wheatgrass shots are bitter and leave your mouth tasting like a freshly mowed lawn, but Krayvings shot is sweet and left my mouth tasting great.  The Ginger shot was excellent, a tad on the spicy side since there was cayenne pepper added to it, but so good and worth the heat.  Overall, I had an excellent experience with the staff and the food. I highly recommend Krayvings!",

I loved how friendly they were while ordering and serving the food. I ordered a protein plate with tofu and brown rice while my bf ordered a turkey sandwich. They were both delicious. When I finish my meal, I don't feel heavy and it's a good amount of food for the price. When something was wrong with my food, it was very nice of them to fix it. We are gonna keep coming back and would recommend for others to try. :)",

Which is good, but his staff doesn't care so much what's going on after you order your food.    The food was very good!  I ordered the Mediterranean Turkey for $10.99.

The Food didn't take long and was bagged up and ready to go in good timing. They have outdoor and indoor seating. It feels like a cottage. I have to say my burger was fantastic. It had that grill taste. It does break apart but most black bean burgers do. It is the closest in taste to a real burger that I have had. It has that grilled Burger taste. Now it doesn't come with fries. Instead it's a salad. The price is high like most health places. Also my wife wasn't as ha ppt with here wrap. She said it was mostly lettuce with 2 little strips of bacon and hardly any tomato. I would go back to this place. Try it for yourself. The veg burger is good. I also did get a B12 drink and it was good. Good Luck Krayvings!!!!",

Thus, my trip to Krayvings was born.   The service here is excellent. For a fast casual type of place, the staff are super kind, and they regularly check in on you.   The cafe would be a nice place to hang out in summer. In January, it was cold on the inside and much too cold for me to sit outside.   As for the food, I ordered the chicken caesar wrap. I enjoyed it. There was plenty of dressing, and the chicken was well cooked. The side salad really wasn't necessary, given that I was eating a salad already inside a tortilla.   My only issue is the price. It's a little bit on the expensive side for a quick lunch. I wouldn't come here regularly as a result.   Overall, this is a solid, healthy lunch option, though.",

HOWEVER, I also want to make it clear that this was for a group take out order of 7 dishes and had to give them some room for error.   We had some struggles calling in our order so maybe I would recommend to go in and order in person. There are a lot of great options for everyone, however, 3 of our orders were either completely wrong or missing an important component of the meal. My coworker and I ordered salmon with brown rice, were told there were no sauteed vegetables or sauce so we had to sub so we asked to just get the brown rice with teriyaki sauce for the salmon. When we opened our boxes, we both had salmon with bbq sauce on it, quinoa and the sauteed vegetables they said they didn't have. The other item we had a mess up on was a breakfast steak meal but it was missing eggs even though eggs were in the description. Besides that, the people who ordered wraps, sandwiches and salad were happy with their order.   The ingredients seemed fresh and I'd definitely give this place another shot but only if I was dining in and not taking out. It wasn't amazing but it's a good spot to get a lighter meal or a drink!",

The chipotle aioli sauce just went so good with the burger. I am definitely coming back the next time I'm in the area.

Friendly service. I'm not a fan of the iPad electronic ordering system. It's easy to use, I just would rather order from someone. Although the benefit of doing it myself is, I've never had a mistake on my order lol. Price is a little high for what it is, but I still recommend this place if you're looking for something healthy to eat.",

The fresh juices are good but they keep trying to put ice in them which is not cool as it further dilutes the juice.   But here is what pains me every time I go in this place and quite frankly has stopped  me from going in a few times.   If you go in to place a to go order (which I do quite often) they try to push you to order through an iPad type device.  It is a complete pain in the ass! For example you can't modify the turkey burger to have it without a bun or to make sure your juice is made without ice in it, or to add turkey sausage to their delicious breakfast wrap.   I don't understand is a to go customer less important than a regular customer and doesn't deserve personalized service? The times that I bypass their system the clerks seems very perturbed at me and make sure to mention that next time I should use the iPads.",

Heading over to the other side of the 215 on Charleston we dropped into Krayving as a healthy alternative to the usual stuff we grab. With a nice indoor seating area I was a little unsure if we stepped into a college campus cafe or a bizarro Starbucks.  Each table had a Laptop attached to order your food. Being able to add subtract and make your own order was a nice surprise. Images on the iPad were also a sweet little touch that was unexpected.   So seating ourselves and browsing through the menu I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with my son having the grilled cheese and sliced apples from the Kids Menu. The salads was pretty dam good!!!   My order came out in what looked like a biodegradable plate with biodegradable fork. I don't think I've seen this anywhere except the container park downtown.  With the outside seating area still under construction I will say this place maybe a new local lunch spot I'll be coming back to. Fresh food, unique ordering and a friendly staff this place is highly recommend for anyone on this side of town.  FYI   They do have high chairs and a kids menu (credit) the menu I would say is catered for 1 and up.",

    "text": "ALLELUIA!  A healthy food option has opened at the Albertsons plaza on the corner of W. Charleston and Desert Foothills.  A favorite meet-up place for cyclists, runners, and hikers because it's the last stop for food and gas before heading into the Red Rock  Canyon area, Krayvings is a welcome addition to the plaza.  Now we can have recovery food that's not donuts, pizza, bar food, or frozen yogurt.    Open for less than a week, I met a friend here for dinner who eats clean ALL the time; he's the one who told me about this new place.  Each table has a tablet PC where customers can browse the menu, customize their orders if desired, and hit the \"send\" button for the kitchen staff.  There are teas, smoothies, salads, sandwiches, wraps, bowls, and pastries to choose from on the menu that is an athlete's dream; there are  protein options here!  I opted for the Steak Superfood Protein Bowl with vegetables and quinoa instead of brown rice.  My friend had the Chicken Superfood Protein Bowl with quinoa, too.  Unfortunately, they had just run out of quinoa and it would be at least 20 minutes before a new batch was ready, so we opted for the brown rice.  Our server offered us free dessert, juice, or a smoothie to compensate for the inconvenience, but nerds that we are, we declined.  The orders took longer than we both thought they should, but I'll chalk that up to this being a new place and give them the benefit of the doubt.  Our bowls had about 5 ounces of meat each, plus at least a cup of brown rice.  The rice was a little soggy for my taste, but the steak was good.  As with a new place, there are lots of staff around and not too many customers yet, but I anticipate that we'll be frequenting this place a lot, especially for breakfast/lunch recovery food.  Welcome to the 'hood, Krayvings--we've been waiting for you.",

It has been open for just a few weeks so there are some growing pains with the staff and organization.  It was very busy on Sunday at 1300 when I went.  Personally I loved the ordering at your own pace and personal customization of your order from the tablet menus.  What I was most surprised about was the flavorful health food that can been found all over the menu.  For you Veggie Lovers out there I highly recommend the Tofu Power Protein Bowl!  My wife loved the BBQ chicken wrap, and my mother in law loved the Turkey Club, which was huge.  Give this place a try especially if you are a health nut like me.  I couldn't be happier that this place arrived at a location desperately in need of a healthy option!",

    "text": "Take a look at my Yelp page and you'll see I'm not the most health conscious eater by any means. Sometimes I wish I had the willpower to do so but I can't cut out all the bad fatty, fried, greasy, salty, sugary food that I love so much. But even so, Kravings is new and sometimes a good healthy meal really hits the spot.  Krayving's is pretty new to the area and if you're inside the actual Albertson's center, you might miss it. For whatever reason, the sign on the inside, above their building, is extremely small. They are located in the far SW corner of the shopping center in between Toro's & John Cutter.   When you walk in, it almost looks like a Panera/Zupas type ordering system but it's far from it. The staff was extremely nice and asked if it was our first time. It was, so they walked us over to a table and explained how it works. There's a tablet at every table in which you can pick what you want to eat, customize it and then send the order to the kitchen. While it's not the smoothest system, it's far better than other table systems I've seen at places like Genghis Grill.  I ordered a steak protein bowl and substituted the quinoa for brown rice. The steak was cooked well and nicely seasoned. The rice was thoroughly cooked and they loaded the bowl with crisp, fresh veggies. My only complaint was lack of seasoning throughout the rest of the bowl. It might be something to do with nutritional value but I felt like only the steak itself had been seasoned so I had to add some salt and pepper for taste.  We also ordered a PB, B & J to share. Thankfully, I didn't order a sandwich for my dinner. Even though the flavor was great and my inner fatty absolutely loves dipping something into marshmallow fluff, the bread was a huge let down. It was dry and bland.   Overall, this is a great spot and while I think the prices are a bit high, I wouldn't hesitate to come back. That banana split smoothie looks amazing!",

Went in with the BF for lunch- Heather was super sweet and friendly, and seated us immediately and showed us how to work the tablets to place our order.  Shared the shrimp bowl and the kale and beet salad (added steak). I preferred the bowl, which was layered with quinoa (brown rice was another menu option), veggies, and shrimp, with a lemon sauce and mint. Initial impression was that the dish was very watery, but it had good flavor to it.  the lemon flavor and the mint/basil in the bottom of the dish worked well together. Flavor was light and borderline bland- saw many guys around the dining room dousing their food in hot sauce, seems to be an issue for many dishes. The salad was okay: considering the word \"beet\" was used in the name, i expected a slightly more plentiful portion of it. Salad also consisted of apple and walnut,  we added on steak for an extra $4 charge. Steak itself was dry and overcooked, portion wasn't worth $4. Salad also came with an interesting herbal dressing, but there was very little of it, rendering this salad fairly dry, which is why it wasn't as liked as the bowl above.  Pricing overall was relatively fair, $10 per dish including our add-ons, but the salad was disappointing. This place seemed to be marketed more towards vegans/vegetarians, but really, most restaurants have salads and wraps and the occasional tofu dish that they can access- I hope they add a few more adventurous dishes to the menu once they settle in.  Might come back to try other options like the BLT chop salad or wrap, or maybe a sandwich, but overall I was a little underwhelmed.",

I enjoyed the fresh tasting combination of the seafood, vegetables and quinoa. I did not like the sauce which tasted like thin mix of peanuts.  The menu has a wide variety of healthy choices. I plan a return visit to try their glazed salmon plate.",

It seems they try to appeal to the healthier eating lifestyle crows, but they also had bacon, eggs & toast on the menu. So I was happy.  I'd like to be part of the healthy lifestyle crowd, but if I haven't joined the crowd by 55 I'm pretty sure it aint never gonna happen.  Food was good. I really enjoyed your toast! Coffee was great.  The staff was excellent.  Thanks for a great breakfast!",

The combos are excellent deals, though! Got a delicious smoothie with my egg wrap as a combo for a great price.",

Lots of green lettuce with steak, croutons and Parmesan cheese, but it did need more dressing which the young lady at the register brought us extra dressing for salads and wraps. This might turn into one of our go to spots when we are in the area.",

Another customer that was relaxing in the restaurant said all the vegan food was really good.   He was right. They were delicious. I didn't even eat them right away. But they were tasty heated up in the microwave. The juice was also very good but didn't not heal this nasty flu. I guess I will have to go back and get another.

Alexis took our order and she suggested I get the pulled chicken sandwich. It was AMAZING!! Lots of chicken in a tangy and spicy sauce. The brioche bun was soft and lightly buttered. It came with a big side salad with a white vinaigrette dressing that was tasty. In my opinion the salad needed salt and pepper to make it perfect.   I got chips on the side and my total bill for 2 sandwiches, salads and chips was just over $30.   I love that Krayvings is also allowing my running group to meet there for my group run tomorrow morning. This is the reason why I went and supported this small business!",

It was good, however, it could have used a little more salad dressing. Next time I will ask for more on the side.   My only two complaints would be that when we got there we were reviewing the menus because you have to order at the counter and we were talking and right in the middle of our conversation, a worker yelled at us to get our attention to let us know that we order with him when we were ready. It took both of us off guard. Ok.  After we ordered we sat and ate and caught up on life. A kid comes up to the table, (my plate empty, my girlfriend's plate 1/2 full) and asked my friend if she was done and if he wanted to take her plate. She said yes please, and he took it and left, but left my empty plate in front of me. Just made us laugh.   The food is good. But the customer service could use a little help.",

Well, maybe that's not the attention grabbing headline they were hoping for, but I can't think of a more perfect example of a 3.5 Star experience than the one we had recently at Krayvings.   My love and I came in for lunch and took the opportunity to share a Salmon Wrap, Sweet Potato & Kale Wrap, and a bowl of Chili. The Chili was forgettable enough that we finished half and the remaining half has sat in our fridge untouched for a few days now. The Salmon Wrap was fine. My love and I eat a lot of salmon, including our share of salmon wraps, and this wasn't bad, but it also wasn't one that I think I'd rush to come back for. Which leads us to the surprise of the day for me...the Sweet Potato & Kale Wrap! This was the bright spot of our eating experience. I wasn't expecting much from this wrap, but it hit the spot and salvaged an otherwise below average experience.   On our visit, the staff was inconsistent. We were greeted with a warm smile when placing our order, but then I also felt like getting to-go containers was a hassle for the employee after I waited in line to ask for them at the counter.  I appreciate the fact that Kravings has some healthier options, as well as some vegetarian and vegan items on the menu, but in the end, there was little to love, less to like, and nothing to make me want to go out of my way to come back. Still, I enjoyed it enough that I wouldn't put up a fight if someone I was with wanted to eat here.",

It was the most flavorful, wonderful dish the first time I tried it and I came back again and again and again. Every weekend we would go to red rock to hike and then often stop at krayvings on the way home.  I would get this menu item a lot though sometimes I'd mix it up with other things.  I could not get enough of this bowl. In the last six months, it has become inconsistent at best. They frequently forget to add the items that are supposed to come with it, and just overall it hasn't been good. I tried giving them more chances, but now the last three times in a row my order hasn't come out right including the time they hard poached the egg that you are supposed to be able to break over the top. We then had to wait 5+ minutes for new eggs while everything else got cold. The final straw came last night. We ordered two bowls to go, add avocado to each bowl. They made the bowls and then forgot to make the eggs for one of them so we ended up having to wait even longer than usual. When we got home, we discovered they only gave us avocado for one, even though we paid for two, and they didn't even bother to include the chimichurri. The steak was not marinated the way it used to be and was very dry. I have tried to be forgiving, because of how much I loved this bowl, but this is too much. I will not be going back.",

It is a new business so there are some kinks to be worked out but they are on top of it!  The owner has been there each time I've been in.  He's been personable and friendly and is out on the floor serving food and working hard with the rest of them.  My only dislikes are the juices, albeit I'm a huge fan, are a little on the more pricey side.  Also ordering from the ipads at each table seem like they should be a huge convenience but seem to be a little more troublesome than they should be.  There are a couple of times I've wanted to just order a juice to go. Finding an open table to order from a tablet and sitting and waiting for the juice and the bill to be delivered then going up to the cashier to pay seems more of a hassle then heading to the cashier ordering and leaving.  Minor things.  This place is great and has even better potential that I'm sure they will reach in no time.",

    "text": "I went with my son and friend for breakfast. He needed a high chair but they're kept in the back, which is annoying when there are no waiters... They need to keep them accessible. But, more importantly, the food was just okay and we both found the iPad menu extremely frustrating. Unless you're ordering the food exactly as on the menu, it's difficult to customize. And don't even try to delete something off the order. I ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. I didn't get the eggs as I wanted them because apparently I didn't customize right. Sandwich was ok - bread very dry and way too thick. My friend got the quinoa bowl and she said it was just ok. We both got the B12 shot drinks and hers was tan and mine was green. They did offer to fix hers (but why did they bring it out in the first place). I liked mine. So overall, hate the iPads, food was \"eh\" and has some kinks to work out. Will try again for lunch before I write it off.",

Ordering was easy and I didn't have any issues receiving my order EXCEPT when this lady dropped off my chicken bowl to me asked me quite rudely if I had paid.  I don't know if that is a common practice but it came off VERY rude.  I said \"yes\" and was offended because I don't think I look like a theif or as anyone that would not or could not pay.  I would have given five stars except for this person.  I would recommend Krayvings maybe give numbers with the receipt to people who are waiting for take-out orders to avoid this in the future if they are so worried.  If I had not paid I doubt the front-register person would have already handed me my chips and drink that I was waiting with.  That being said, the chicken protein bowl was pretty good.  It was a blend of chicken, that seemed like real chicken (not processed,) quinoa and kale, onions, carrots and zucchini.  My drink was a bit tart so next time I might ask for less apple?",

Terrible service and have gone down hill for quite some time. I keep giving this place a chance but like a cheating mate keep getting screwed, nothing changes and only you are to blame! Learn from your mistake the first time and don't go back. Drove from other side of town waited and drive back to discover the freakin burger wasn't in the box! The lettuce was and that was it ! The guy or girl who closed the box didn't find that odd!!! Really??!!! Then they tried to say the burger was in it?!!! Where?!!! It must've been the size of a peanut because I fumbled thru the so called side salad with no dressing and didn't see any likes of a burger!! I know what a lettuce wrapped burger is supposed to look like! Time before that ordered a wrap with chicken and no chicken!! Time before that ordered a wrap with avocado only to find no avocado!! Shame on you guys! Get your shit straight! You can't even get your damn orders right!!! The owner needs to wake up and read some of these reviews, most people who have complaints don't even bother posting but I love to speak my mind so lucky you!!",

    "text": "A different type of atmosphere at this place. The restaurant utilizes iPads to order, rather than servers and it still gives you a chance to personalize your order. If you change a couple of things, someone will still come over to confirm. Personally, I really liked this part of the restaurant.  Food: both times I came here I got a tofu bowl. I really liked the taste. The tofu vegetables, and sauce really meshed well. The bowls range from 8-13 depending on what type of protein you pick. You also have the option to add other things to it, like eggs. I got an egg the second time I came but I don't think it made much difference to the taste.  Juices; the juices here seem pretty popular. They are on the pricier side though. A medium is about $7 and a large is 10-11 I think. I decided to try the zen. I liked the taste, it was pretty addicting. I don't think I'd come here for juice though.   Atmosphere: the restaurant is pretty chill. Some people come here to work on their laptops, after workout snack, lunch with the family, there's just a pretty wide range demographic. It's definitely a good place to come to with friends, you never feel rushed to leave. There's a lot of seating inside and also some outside seating.   If only I lived closer, this would definitely be a place to frequent.",

    "text": "Maybe had we gone another time we would have had a better experience, but our first time to this restaurant left me with a pretty bad impression.   Since we had never been to Krayvings before, we were a little bit confused upon entering. It wasn't entirely clear whether we were supposed to seat ourselves and order from the tablets on the table, or to order up at the counter. There were only 2 other people dining at the time, so I tried to make eye contact with a staff member, to no avail; no one greeted us at all, actually. My husband and I decided to seat ourselves, and ultimately I walked up to the counter and asked for help. A staff member came to our table and explained the tablet situation. I also grabbed a paper menu because I thought it would be easier to look through. It didn't take me long to realize that although very similar, the paper menu and the tablet did not reflect all of the same items. So we wound up using both to choose our dishes, and used the tablet to place our order.  About 10 minutes later, our food was brought out. My husband had swapped a side salad for sweet potato hash on the tablet, but the side salad was brought out instead. He reminded the food runner, and she did bring out the correct dish.  The food was fine, but severely overpriced. We ate just about everything on our plates since soup, salad and a sandwich cost $35. We sat for a bit after we finished eating, and when no one came by to bus our table (again, we weren't sure of the protocol), we located a trash can and decided that we'd clean it up ourselves. I picked up the stack of plates and bowls, and almost immediately upon standing, what was left in the tomato soup bowl went crashing to the floor sending tomato soup splattering everywhere. I immediately got on my hands and knees and began sopping it up with napkins. My husband grabbed another bunch while I did my best to clean the mess off of the floor, the adjacent table and myself. Meanwhile, multiple members of the staff literally walked around me while I cleaned the floor. Not one person offered help; not one person grabbed a mop; not one person said a word. So there I knelt, in the middle of this restaurant, sopping tomato soup off the floor with dozens of paper napkins while the staff completely ignored me and the entire situation. It was all actually quite embarrassing.  Once I'd finished cleaning the floor (to the best of my ability using only napkins), we got in line to pay. We stood there for over 8 minutes, and all the while, not one person addressed the now sticky mess of remnant tomato soup on the floor. We got to the register and the cashier gave us our total. When we asked about the chocolate chip cookies that we never received (but were still on our bill), she told us that she didn't have any. After a very awkward pause, she asked us if we'd like her to remove them from our bill. Well, we certainly didn't want to pay for an item that they didn't even have in stock! Finally, after I'd signed my receipt, I kindly reminded the cashier that there was a spill that should probably be addressed. At which point, she points to me and hollers across the restaurant \"They had a spill! Can you mop it up?!\" to one of the staff members that carefully stepped around me while I was cleaning the floor earlier. I'm pretty sure he already knew about it, though. Needless to say, we're in no hurry to visit again.  TL;DR Fair, but overpriced food and terrible service.",

I had heard great things, but was unsure of the \"healthy\" menu (some restaurants fail terribly.) I walked in and was instantly greeted by a kind employee. He asked me if I needed help, and handed me a menu. Once I was ready, the staff directed me to where you order. I ordered the turkey burger (one of their best sellers) with the sweet potato hash (extra $2-$3). After paying, I had some \"flower\" water (delicious), and read through the menu for future reference. I didn't notice how long I was sitting, but after a short wait my food was ready. I waited maybe 15 minutes tops (on a busy Saturday afternoon), and was given a \"free complimentary beverage\" for a wait that wasn't even bad!    As for the food, the flavor in the turkey burger was phenomenal. Packed with great ingredients! The sweet potato hash was different than what I expected, but still tasty. Basically diced sweet potato pieces with some extra flavor added. I'll definitely be returning and recommending. Great for a pre/post workout! They also have juices and shakes that I'm excited to try! Thank you for the kind service and great food!",

    "text": "Updating my review to the Full Five after today's meal! I've been a fan of Krayvings since they opened. They are consistent in great flavors & service.   While Kray's menu definitely caters to many different diet preferences (vegan, gluten) they fall a little short on sugar free options and there lies my challenge --probably why I haven't been there in a few months even though it's around the corner.  So today I was krayving their breakfast wrap and decided to go with the determination of customizing something on the menu to what would fit with my diet -- and I did it! And it was my most delicious and satisfying meal there yet!  So here is my suggestion to Krayvings - I was able to customize the heck out of your STEAK BREAKFAST BOWL to what turned out to be: Sweet potato hash, mixed veggies, egg whites, avocado, chimichurri and your AMAZING SALSA - all the other stuff on the side because it didn't change the price.  You have several great bowl options that are customizable so why not just make a \"Build a Bowl\"?  Also, I would get a smoothie if I could swap out juice base for almond milk, and fruits that are lower glycemic (berries).  Love your menu, please consider some low sugar / low carb options - thanks!",

The sandwich came to me in a reasonable amount of time and the service was friendly and showed us how to use the tablet on the table. However, my sandwich had no prosciutto, olives, or dijonassie which I didn't realize tip I was a 1/4 of the way through my sandwich, I called the server over and he took my food away and said they'd make me a new one. The second one came out and looked completely different, idk if they assumed Americans wouldn't know what prosciutto was and decided to leave it off or if it was a mistake but by the time it came out I wasn't really hungry any more, I grazed a little and my boyfriend actually found a BONE in the chicken. At that point I was just done. My boyfriends bbq wrap was also not satisfactory, he said there was no bbq sauce (?!) on it and no black beans. All in all, I don't think we'll be returning. Too bad....",

It was about 4 pm when we came in. Just one other couple there and a few customers sitting outside. We placed an order and took about 10-12 minutes for our food to come. Food was ok. We got a steak caesar wrap, a green shake , and a berry acai bowl.  Better off getting a juice or smoothie because that acai bowl was just as watery as a smoothie. Pretty spacious inside. Thought there was trash on the floor but it was just stacks of napkins to even out several of the tables. That's a lot of napkins to waste daily. Just saying. Ladies room was a little dirty. Went in restroom after an employee thinking maybe she would of did something about getting it cleaned up . Went back again 25 minutes later and still was messy. Love their healthy choices but nothing special to go out of my way for.",

    "text": "I had the privilege of taking my son out to many lunch dates last week. While he decided to splurge on in-n-out the day prior while I took the role of envious on-looker, I got to choose the following day's lunch spot. Using my trusty Yelp App, I looked for something healthy in the Summerlin area. Krayvings popped up. I can't believe I've never heard of this place, especially considering my in-laws live across the street. We walked in around 1pm and were greeted by a sweet server who proceeded to explain how to order off of the ipad.   What a wonderful system!! I have many friends who have dietary restrictions, and instead of ingredients getting lost in translation, they would be able to pick and choose exactly what they wanted to add or exclude and send it directly to the kitchen. We would also avoid the eye-roll of servers from being \"picky\" as some like to call it. We sat out on the patio and enjoyed wonderful, healthy, and delicous food on a beautiful day. My son chose the tofu bowl which had zucchini, yellow squash, onion, and tofu over a bed of quinoa. It was HUGE and he seriously almost finished the entire thing! He's a little beast when it comes to eating tofu and I'm happy I could get such healthy food for him on the go.   I ordered the baby kale and sweet potato salad with grilled chicken instead of shrimp. I also opted for the lemon vinegarette rather than balsalmic. This was a gorgeous, light salad with rainbows of veggies and sweet potato. I wish there was more sweet potato (which you can add on the ipad!) and that they were cooked more consistently. However, overall, this was a great salad that filled me up. We also shared a small melon juice which was so good, especially with the tang at the end from the lemon. Upon check-out, I saw the tray of oversize chocolate chip cookies which my son convinced me to purchase. It was also delicious. The total for our meal was a bit on the pricey side, but that's usually what happens when you dine at a healthy restaurant. I would love to know where the ingredients are purchased from, and if they're organic as they're not specified on the menu. I guess I'll have to ask next time I'm there. Thanks Krayvings for being so inviting and we will definitely be back.",

The smoothies are freshly made and a bit pricey. For dessert, I can't feel too guilty about munching on one chocolate cookie. An uber-yummy cookie at that.  One very odd thing is their insistence to have customers order through iPads. The screen is hard to see when seated outside. On one occasion, the darn thing ran out of battery mid-order and the user interface is really not that good. I would imagine older folks and people who are not as computer savvy would have trouble with their order. Heck, I work with computers and it took me over five minutes to place my order for the first time. I've seen servers have to take the time to teach customers how to order. This is an epic failed attempt in efficiency.  Krayvings either needs to improve their electronic ordering system or give it up entirely and just focus on making good food.",

    "text": "Okay so this place is my new favorite place to eat. I saw an ad on Facebook advertising this amazing looking breakfast wrap called \"on the go\". It's delicious! It consists of egg whites, avocado, onions, sweet potato, some type of green salsa, sour cream, and I added bacon. It also comes with a side of salsa. It's very filling and extremely healthy minus my fatal attraction to bacon. Looking at the menu I can see there will be more favorites! I also love the fact that this place seems to be family owned and the food quality is fantastic. Lastly the price is great too!",

    "text": "Krayvings Yelp Review  My wife and I came in for lunch at 11 am for the grand opening.  ATMOSPHERE Not crowded, with a comfortable amount of people already at lunch; picking up as we were leaving at 1230. Casual cafe dining, open floor plan, no booths, outdoor seating available Spread steel chairs and rectangular tables with wooden tops, each table seats two, but the tables can easily be pushed together for larger groups Vaulted ceilings Mellow, up beat music like John Mayer or John Mellencamp  ORDERING Done through a tablet touch screen at each table Menus are separated by breakfast, greens (salad), wraps, bread (sandwiches), sides, dessert, drinks, bowls (soup), and grab and go (chips, cookies, pastries). After you select your food, you have the option of customizing your order (adding/reducing ingredients).  Keep in mind that adding options will probably increase the meal cost while reducing or removing options will likely keep the price the same. The tablets have a Call Server button in the upper right hand corner that will bring your attendant over. All food and drinks are brought to you by the server.  FOOD We had the BLT wrap, krayvings veggie wrap, and breakfast bacon, egg, rice wrap.  Each wrap also had a small green salad with dressing included.  All very tasty and fresh.  Salads were crisp and crunchy with slightly sweet and tangy dressing.   Final bill came out to around $24, including tax, but not tip. Food is served on brown butcher paper on an aluminum plate.  Flatware and drinking cups are all ECO product plastic, made from plants and bio-degradable & compostable.  CUSTOMER RECOMMENDATIONS Enjoy browsing through the tablet menu.  Krayvings has many different dishes with a wide variety of customization options.  Take time to enjoy the atmosphere and food.  RESTARUANT RECOMMENDATIONS Place label stickers on tablets similar to ones on tables to simplify matching tablets to tables.  The tablet at our table didn't work initially so we swapped tablets with a different table; making things confusing because we would receive orders for tables that probably had the tablet linked to our physical table.  Wait for all the orders at one table to be finished before bringing the bills.  Because we had two separate orders, there was some confusion on what our total bill would be.  I can see customers potential taking advantage of this by making multiple orders, but only paying for one bill.  There isn't any direct feedback about whether your server has gotten the Call Servers notification because most of the servers were waiting by the kitchen and drinks to bring out food.  One option is to give small vibrating pagers to each server, that when someone presses the Call Server button, the table number pops up on the pager.  FINAL THOUGHTS Krayvings is likely to rapidly rise in popularity due to its convenient location between the 215 loop, Red Rock Casino, and Red Rock Canyon.  The food is delicious and healthy.  They will likely overcome the slight tricks with launch and use of tablets for ordering.  My wife and I are likely to eat there again as we enjoy going hiking in Red Rock Canyon and taking friends to new places to eat.",

    "text": "Me: For a sandwich, salad or wrap that has individually flavorful and fresh components that could stand on their own and not just to fill a sandwich or wrap, with nothing super fancy (we had a steak Caesar wrap and  BBQ chicken wrap), yet current (read: beet, kale and quinoa found here!) and healthy without pretense of being raw, vegan or gluten-free by definition but just by circumstance, this is a great place. [breathe, run on]. It's easy with kids with their tablet self ordering at each table and accessible options. There's fresh juices and smoothies as well as some nice baked sweets items. For what it offers, it's done deliciously and fresh here. Great for easy, healthy (yet not necessarily vegan or gluten-free or expensive) salad/wrap/smoothie joint food.   Him: The food is awesome. The steak inside the burrito (wrap) was flavorful. I like sous vide (!) steak best, then Krayvings', then other restaurants'. It's that good. The BBQ chicken wrap had a BBQ sauce that was better than just ordinary BBQ (it was a creamy BBQ), and the salad is crispy and the chicken was good too because it was moisturized [sic] and not dry. I had the pineapple mojitos juice and loved it because it was nice and refreshing and good for drinking in the summer. You can really taste pineapple and mint! The best was the apple tart because the cooked apple went really well with the outside crust which was thick and better than pie which sometimes has too much fruit.",

I was always a fan of Krayvings, but my first few visits I wasn't into the ipad ordering system. I decided to customize my meal this morning and it truly does add to the experience. The touchscreen gives you plenty of great options, especially if you're particular with your diet.  I went for the Bison Burger minus the brioche bun (which I'm sure is great) and added fontine cheese, spicy aoli, and egg- lettuce wrap style. First bite was a \"damn that's good!\" moment. The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy with a delicious outer char. The carmelized onions brought it home big time.   The staff was great and my server took the time to tell me all about how my meal was prepared, which I always appreciate. Be sure to try out their smoothies too, the PB Nutella being my personal fav. Keep up the good job Krayvings!",

However, I'm not looking to criticize, but always appreciate constructive feedback and their acai bowls could use some help. Anyways, I'll be back and I'll keep exploring the menu!",

The steak caesar wrap is delicious & the strawberry chicken salad w/ the chimichurri sauce is like nothing I've ever had before. Normally Turkey burgers have no flavor & are gross but theirs is seasoned to perfection. I highly recommend the daily detox juice w/ beets & ginger!

If you enjoy healthy food that isn't over processed or over salted, give them a try!",

The staff was super friendly when I arrived and the ambience was nice. If I didn't arrive so close to closing time I would have sat down and enjoyed my food rather than taking it to go.   The only negative is that I had a hard time finding it but after talking to the guy who helped me I learned that the lack of signage is the decision of the management above them. So if you're having a hard time finding this place it's right next to John Cutter.   Overall I'll definitely be back to try everything else on the menu.",

My kids ordered a pizza-and it was ok. The ordering from the table and paying when you leave at the counter is a little weird. I'm never sure how much to tip since I'm grabbing my own drink and stuff. Anyway, i wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, I would do so merely out of convenience and maybe someone I'm with wanted to go. But seriously the food is below average.",

We got there around noon on a weekday and by about 12:30, they were packed! Soon after we sat down, a server came over to greet us and as it was our first visit, he showed us how to order using the table iPads. I love that it allows you to customize your order (add this, no that)!  Ordered the chopped BLT salad. Worried that the creamy dressing would be heavy, but it was a light dressing, similar to what they offer at Red Velvet Cafe. Great taste and reduced guilt because it didn't seem \"mayonnaisey\" as I like to say. Salad was both yummy and filling. If you're an iced tea lover like me, try their peach iced tea (brewed, unsweetened).  Hubby ordered the club sandwich, which he said was good. Apple slices give a nice twist to the traditional club.  I'll be coming back again soon!",

Find a spot indoors or out. A iPad tablet is your menu so peruse and order at your table. A friendly waitress is around to guide you if a first timer.  You can also place orders to go at the counter-did I mention they serve up breakfast too?  A little glass shelf shows up some baked goods-the lemon poppy muffin is fabulous.  We shared a BLT wrap and oh my goodness I've been \"krayving\" to come back just for this!  A huge tossed green salad comes with this entree.  We also wanted to try a few side dishes so opted for the Quinoa salad served cold with cucumbers and a sweet potato hash with some julienne greens.  Both outstanding and FRESH.  I ordered the \"skinny\" drink which had some strawberry's and kiwi among other delights and I loved it-it was a perfect blend of sweetness and greenness.  The hubby was fighting a cold so he had a drink featuring carrots and more yumminess.  Overall we left \"krayving\" for more.  Recovery food for sure so if you're looking for some healthy yummy flavorful eats come here!    Located in the Albertson's shopping center off of Charleston in Summerlin.",

One that assure you after any brick day or just enjoying perfect cycling day be back soon.   Talk about great healthy options on the menu. I know lot  of yelpers have passion for Skinnyfats. Really from the minute walked in, looking at the decor, the chalkboard menu style on the walls (some nice little hand artwork on it too), really health conscious menu, the nice portion size, and screamed Skinnyfats.   I ordered the  sesame chicken wrap and blueberry muffin. As soon as you walk in see all the pastries in the display and they looked really really good. I started with the blueberry muffin that enjoyed. I was nice moist, hot, and right amount of blueberry in every bite. The sesame chicken wrap was awesome. Usually not high on wraps but the sesame chicken wrap not only was it hearty, but each component really complimented one another (from the chicken, nice orange segments, cucumbers, sesame seeds, carrots, friend won ton strips, and lettuce all tossed in some kind of asian dressing) so much flavor in every bite. It was so REFRESHING after brick workout out at the Lake. I wanted too order another wrap! Oh almost forgot about the salad on the side was nice too and again nice size portion.   The ordering system found interesting or not too often literally ordered off a touch screen. Not too fool you thinking not humans. LOL!! It was really helpful  when it comes too getting a visual of every dish on the menu. But at the same time can be confusing. The wait staff is great always helping you out if confused about anything. Everyone friendly and great service the whole time.",

I've been here twice and went off Yelp tips and ordered the BBQ chicken wrap.  It's also listed on their menu as a best seller. It's $10.80 for the wrap and it comes with a side salad.  I think that's a fair price.  The honey BBQ sauce is not overwelming as I could taste all the ingredients with each bite.  The black beans and avocado are a nice touch.  First time I ordered at the counter.  Second time I used Eat24 which saved me $2 off my order.  It's a useful app but it does take a little longer to prepare your order if utilizing it.    In addition to wraps they offer smoothies, breakfast items, salads, sandwiches, burgers and a kids menu, among other things.  They have a nice size dining area and the staff is very friendly.  I'm only taking away 1 star because when I picked up my food yesterday there was a patron with a dog in her lap and I don't think it was service dog.  I understand it's hot outside but unless it's a service dog I don't think that should be allowed and I'm a huge animal lover!",

We ordered a salad and a hummus sandwich. The iPad ordering system is very cool, but takes a bit of time to get used to, also the payment is taken manually by the restaurant staff. The service was a bit lacking overall. You obviously have to get your own drinks and utensils. Staff only brings you the food. There was also not enough tables or seats inside the restaurant.   The salad and the sandwich were both ok, mediocre in taste and presentation, it was a rather small salad and it cost more than $10, definitely more expensive than some of the comparable restaurants in the area. We also each got a fruit smoothie with came in a very small cup, and cost $7 each, the same thing and same size costs $4 at Jamba Juice. Definitely a bit of a cult following and snob appear to cater to the snooty folks in Summerlin.   Probably won't come back.",

That being said, you can customize the orders via the tablets.  I had a Pineapple Mojito juice and a breakfast sandwich. Both came out prompt. Good flavor, felt full. Would keep coming back!",

It was as if the patty was made in advance, refrigerated, and then placed into a convection oven just long enough to melt the slice of cheese laid on top. Unfortunately, the patty was already cold when brought to the table.   2. Flat bread pizza was a challenge to eat/enjoy as it was undercooked, soggy when in-hand, and already cold when brought to the table.  What seems to be needed here is a little maturation in the execution. Maybe next time.",

I normally stick to the tofu which is grilled and served on top of perfectly steamed veggies and quinoa with a light teriyaki on the side.  (I rarely even use that!)   Last time I tried the shrimp as protein and OMG!  fresh, perfectly cooked shrimp and a delicious peanut sauce... and I'm not a fan of peanut sauce at all.  So far everything I have tried has been great, healthy and reasonable prices. The only thing that is just *slightly* disappointing is the green juice I would order anywhere is super citrusy.  Tastes like mostly lime juice.  I like a much denser green juice with a hard core amount of greens.   It's not bad, just not my preference.  If you want a great place for a light meal, stop while biking to/from Red Rock, a place for kids (it seemed fairly kid friendly within reason) this might be it.",

The salad that comes with the meal is a combination of Romaine and Arugula. It is fresh. The \"spine\" of the lettuce is sweet. But vinagrette reminded me of a champagne vinagrette. It was light, flavorful with a subtle \"kick\" to the taste buds. It was delicious.  The burger was cooked well done but still retained a juiciness. I gobbled it up quickly as it tasted so light I didn't feel a rock in my stomach feeling when eating meat of any kind.  I would recommend the food here. It is tasty, fresh, and worth the price. It is especially great after hiking Red Rock Canyon.",

This is not often my nature to change my ratings, but I feel like Krayvings is deserving of the additional star and a top shelf rating on Yelp for the following reasons (in addition to the points noted on my original review):  1) I feel like this staff and their team is a cohesive, happy, friendly, family unit.  They seem to like what they do.  They seem to enjoy working together.  The customer service and fun hospitality delivered by their young, hip staff has become sharper since my patronage.  They are down to earth in a way that is open, direct and refreshing.  When you like where you work, when you believe in your product, when you have been properly trained...it all shows in customer service and is reflective in the customer experience.   2) They refer to you by name and are quick to make sure a new comer understands the niche of the I-Pad ordering process.  They want to you feel comfortable and welcome in their restaurant model.  It feels like family.  It feels laid back.  It feels young, fresh, cool and calm.  Grab them if you do not understand how to order, for they do truly want you to feel welcome.    3) Consistency!  Every tofu wrap, every fresh blended juice, every steamed side of broccoli has been consistent to a fault absolutely every single visit.  My hats off to the culinary team, for this speaks wonders about the custom, made to order items coming out of their kitchen.   Krayvings, I appreciate your service, I crave your clean food and I feel like a valued customer.  Thank you!",

It's located next to John Cutter's, for the record.  Once inside it was a little tricky figuring out the ordering process. I stood behind someone in line at the counter and then guy working the register wasn't very forthcoming with helping us out. You order at the touchscreen and then go to the register to pay for your order. I'm all for technology, but this seemed somewhat inefficient.  My grilled chicken and quinoa bowl was ready and I was out the door quickly with my to go order. The food was decent, but the chicken was on the dry side. I'd likely choose a different protein on my next visit.   Nice little lunch spot with healthy options.",

    "text": "We are glad we found Krayvings as it provides a healthy menu with a decent amount of variety.    All orders are done via an ipad/tablet.  What is really great about it is that the user-interface for the menu and ordering process is very user friendly. if you are a really picky eater and require sauces or sides removed or on the side it is very easy to do.  It removes any doubts that happen when you are doing a verbal order.  The food is pretty tasty.  The wraps remind of of California Chicken Cafe.  Sauces are flavorful.  The portions are solid.  Our recommendations:  BBQ chicken wrap.  Throw some sricha sauce and it tastes even better Chinese chicken wrap.  Tasty Chicken bowl with quinua.  This is a pretty sizable portion.  Very difficult to scarf down a ton of quinua lol.  Beef bowl is pretty decent as well.  This is a place we will visit frequently because its fast, close and I definitely won't feel guilty about eating unhealthy.",

    "text": "Great place for lunch! The menu is creative and the food is very fresh. I had the \"salmon burger\", which was an actual salmon filet on a bun (rather than the processed salmon patty most places serve), topped with fresh apple-and-pineapple pico de gallo and some kind of spicy mayo. Delicious! My husband had a fantastic-looking salad. Their order system also lets you 100% customize your order using the iPad on your table.   The only drawbacks are that the location is on the small side, and it probably gets noisy at busy times since it's designed in the industrial style where there's nothing to absorb sound - but both of those will improve when it's warm enough for the patio tables to be open! I'll definitely be back!",

The staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful and the food was fantastic!! Daisy in particular helped us order with some of her secrets that she adds to the salads and sandwiches! She also suggested the cookies which were fresh that day and amazing!! Can't thank her enough!  We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas for the protein bowls! They looked amazing!   This was the perfect place to have a healthy, delicious lunch after a beautiful day at the canyon. (It also has outdoor seating, a major plus for someone from NYC to enjoy the gorgeous Las Vegas weather!) Thanks again for a great experience and great food!",

Now I always wondered about these systems and how they would affect service but the server likes it so why not embrace modern technology. The system is easy to navigate and let's you customize your order. After checking out a paper menu that is also provided we set our order in motion,  very simple and they got it right... Sweet..!!  I tried the Turkey protein bowl with quinoa. The quinoa was a little strange at first but warmed up to it and the bowl was tasty and kept me filled up for hours without bloat, which for me is tough to do. My g/f had the Egg White and Bacon Breakfast Sandwich with added avocado, always an added treat to any sand which. It was very good and I returned the following day for one to go. Overall we really like Krayvings and will stop here more often now that we finally ate here. Four Stars for Krayvings, could be more but everything is served in paper plates and bowls and untencils are also disposable.",
