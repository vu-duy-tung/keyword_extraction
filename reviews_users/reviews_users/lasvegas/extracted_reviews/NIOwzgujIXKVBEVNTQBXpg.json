    "text": "Sushi  Burgers  are Amazing!!! Wait... let me back it up. Went solo mission to Jjango steak & sushi for lunch today and I think I fell in love and found one of my new favorite places to eat in town. All the way on Fort Apache & patrick (yikes!) and well worth the drive. Came specifically for the sushi burger I read about in the Las Vegas Weekly, but they have everything! Sushi, sushi burritos & so much more. They have both regular happy hour 3-6 & a late night happy hour from 11-2 am. They have 4 different burgers and today I tried the Karai burger (I will try them all). With spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, salmon, cucumber, lettuce & screaming orgasm sauce. I got mine Panko crusted, they also have regular available. So amazingly delicious!!! A lot to eat and I'm stuffed, but so good I could help but eat the whole thing. The service was friendly & the music was also fantastic the whole time I was there. I will be trying to get everyone I know to come here!",

Hope you beat the rush, otherwise you may have to wait to feed your fix. Everything is good...everything. This place also does hibachi and all you can drink options. The other location is amazing, as well. Give either a try.",

The freshman roll is my all time favorite roll ever! they pack in the fish and its always so fresh. The flavor of all items are always on point. Did I mention the PRICES?? Nope. Well let me start with they have AYCE and the menu is HUGEEE. But, if you're not feeling the all mighty eat everything you can ever imagine, they have special pricing on pretty much everything! Special rolls don't exceed $9! The service... haha.... lets just say,  They know me by name. How often do you go somewhere and they know your name?!?! They really care about customer service and I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience!",

Side note the Spicy garlic Edamame was amazing but very very spicy so watch out. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

    "text": "This place rocks as far as the steakhouse part of Jjanga Steak and Sushi goes. Been here three times already since their soft opening. Each visit has been consistent as far having an overall good dining experience.  Hibachi side:  This is where we dined for all three visits. There are several hibachi stations that can accommodate both small and large groups.  There's also dining tables for those who don't want the dinner show dealie. There was no wait for seating availability during the first hour they are open for dinner. I still made reservations in advance each time.     Menu is pretty simple. The starter entree of salad, soup, rice and veggies listed at top of menu is required of all guests dining at the hibachi table. From there you pick your add-ons from 4oz chicken,NY Steak, Filet Mignon, Scallops, or Mahi Mahi. Each piece prices ranged from $5.50- 8.  Lobster and Calamari are 7oz and pricier.    The combo special for 32.95 is the way to go! It comes with Filet Mignon, Chicken, Shrimp and Lobster, includes your starter entree and your choice of appetizer! (we've had Gyoza and Eggrolls)  Mr B ordered his starter entree and his add-ons, we shared the chicken and appetizer from my combo. This was plenty enough food for the both of us.  The portions of fried rice was generous. The bowls of salad and soup was just right. Everything tasted delicious!! I especially enjoyed the very tender filet mignon. The lobster was just a tad tough though. So if you are not getting the combo special, Id skip the lobster.  The dinner show each time was pretty entertaining. It's kitschy(onion volcano) and cheesy(choo choo train), but definitely a fun social experience! We have had different personal chefs each visit and they all have mad teppanyaki skills ala Jackie Chan. They all were pretty personable and knew how to entertain as well as cook and got the orders right for each member of our group.  Ambience - Trendy/Casual. The place is open and airy. The hibachi stations are spread out. The sushi part is sectioned off. The bar area flows into the hibachi part.  Only one minor complaint.  The music being played was too loud and the music choice was more dance club. It would be nice if they can tone it down a bit especially if the majority of diners are \"old people\" like us. Ha!   Service -  A+. Rockstar staff here. The host already knows us and welcomed us back.  Staff kept up with drink refills and clearing our table.  Most recent visit was a birthday celebration with our good friends. It was totally unexpected when they all came out after dinner with red bean ice cream with a candle singing Happy Birthday. Totally unexpected and a nice surprise. Thanks for giving special attention to the little one and the teen in our group too.   I definitely would recommend this place.  Worth the trip coming from our neck of the woods in Henderson. The food is pretty good, the prices are right, and it's family friendly. Five Sake Bombs!",

    "text": "Been here twice. Once for dinner, then again for lunch. All you can eat sushi dinner was 26.99 and lunch was 20.99.   I decided to go for dinner the first time after reading the reviews on yelp. When I read the menu, I saw if you didn't finish your sushi, you'd be charged the a la cart price in addition to the AYCE price (including leaving the rice behind and just eating the fish).  Asked if that applid if I ordered something and didn't like it. Yep. So went with a la carte. Waitress was okay.  Second time did AYCE lunch, and they seated me at a booth instead of a table. :NOTE: The booths have very slick vinyl covers.  The sushi was , and went ahead and ordered the monkey burrito. ($6 a la carte) I reasoned if I didn't like it, would be paying what I would have paid for dinner. Honestly, it's awesome. Tempura is light and crispy. I'd pass on the shumai. Waiter was nice and attentive until...  When I was done, I went toscoot out of the booth, the vinyl was so slick, I literally slid off the bench and landed between my booth and the one next to me, right on my bum. Ow.   Both people on either side of me checked to make sure I was okay. Literally, getting up from their tables and offering to help me up.   No one from the restaurant came over to see if I was okay. I saw them look over, but no action on their part at all.   I am covered in bruises, my lower back hurts, but nothing is broken.   Overall 4.5 for the sushi, 2 for the staff. 0 for the booths. They are evil.",

The server never really came to our table after we ordered the first time (ayce) and we even had empty plates starting to stack up for a while. Even after we finished eating we had to wait for over 30 minutes to get the server's attention to pay. For a place I was a regular at (I normally order to-go), I'm disappointed. I'll probably only call in and order to-go now if I'm ever craving my usual something wrong #69.",

    "text": "Listen, In a town with literally hundreds of sushi bars, most AYCE places have become a joke in the past few years. Some places pre-cut their fish so they can serve people faster, all this does is accelerate the oxidation process and ruin the taste of the fish. Other places let their fish sit for WAY TOO LONG, you can almost smell it when you walk in.  This is why JJanga has been such a reFRESHing (and I mean FRESH) addition to the Vegas AYCE Sushi scene. Their original location is still a weekly trip for me, but now they have opened a second location in the Bishop Gorman area (maybe Snoop Dogg likes sushi?).  And I'm here to tell you - this new location rocks!  Some of their best chefs make the Fort Apache location their regular gig.   There's Sponge (she's a big fan of the Squarepants) and she is always ready to amaze with some very creative concoctions. My recommendation, let Sponge go wild,  take the cuffs off and let her pick, she will create dish after dish of amazing fish that will rock your world - I do and she has never let me down.  While all the \"remember the good ole days?\" sushi bars across the valley continue to serve bad fish, bad service and bad attitudes, JJanga has stepped up and said \"Hey! Happy Days Are Here Again! ...\"  When you see me there, toss me a hello.   :-)",

My all time favorites are:  Pink lady Something wrong 69 XXX Yozu Yellowtail garlic Tuna Crunch roll Jjanga Burrito monkey Burrito Candy Cane  Tip: get the chocolate ice cream...it's chocolate ice cream with crunchies!

I was surprised to see that this place has 4 stars but after reading the comments I realized it's all about the AYCE sushi. Well my girlfriend and I went for the hibachi. We've been to a few hibachi spots in Vegas and compared to them these guys were amateurs. They main ingredient is yum yum so if you don't like the stuff you're pretty much left with salt and pepper. They offer a deal like no other place where you can pick two proteins for 20$ or 3 for I think 25$. Don't expect much food for that. The proteins are poor very small and bad quality. They also don't use garlic they just have a garlic flavored butter. We asked for a side of garlic butter sauce and they literally melted butter on the grill and put it in ramekins. So let's see they don't have garlic butter they don't have oyster sauce. The best food they had was edamame... oh and good drinks. Oh my goodness and the noodles, you're better off without. They are pretty much spaghetti noodles with lettuce and carrot shavings. Don't let the looks fool you this place looks nice but the taste isn't there. The staff was nyehh they were pretty defensive about yum yum sauce being there way. If you want a good Hibachi place go to Musashi or Bonsai let Jjanga stick to sushi.",

The food here is tottaly worth the butt torture. The decor is nothing special. Jumbo pictures of the sushi chefs are an amuzing feature. Music levels vary every time I'm here but its a good mix and not too loud. The all you can eat is $21 for lunch. If u skip the all you can eat, sushi is only $3per 2 piece order and the delicious rolls are cheaper than most places. I eat a ton of sushi and this is one of the best.

Everything is incredible and I love the details -- such as their nigiri rice, it is drizzled with a tasty and lemony sauce. This really made my night. I am not much of a rice eater and this left  a rather wonderful impression on me.   The great thing about this place is that they do not fill you up with rice or large plates for AYCE menu. First of all, nothing is \"off the menu\", you can order everything, some items you can only order once though. Every order came in twos (there were two of us, so one for each) and very small portions served for items such as the Special Sashmi mixes. This was really great because we were able to eat a ton of different items.   All fish was incredibly fresh. The hamachi was probably the best I've had in the city so far, tuna would disintegrate as soon as it hits the tongue and the grilled pike mackerel was so insanely fresh.   I mean everything was amazing... the sweet shrimp, gyoza, garlic tuna, bulgogi, cheese ceoquettes, mushroom balls, oysters,umi. mochi... the list goes on. Just o get some.  2 people, all you can eat with 2 large sake and two large beers came out to about $85.",

Waited for over 10 minutes for them to find the lunch menus & when the waiter came back I asked again for the lunch menu as he took our drink order. He said that \"she\" was trying to find them. I then asked how long he thought it was going to take & mentioned that we were on our lunch hour. He stated he didn't know. I mean seriously how can you not know where your lunch menus are? Finally received 1 lunch menu & we asked for another since not all of us were doing AYCE. Another couple of minutes passed. We finally received was all our drinks. My co-worker mentioned that his glass was all sticky & something white all over the outside of it. Yuck! I told him to ask for a new one but he was afraid of the time it would take. Their lunch menu on their website is different than what it is actually in the restaurant as now in the restaurant is everything is al a cart & you have to pay extra for soup & salad. Where as before when I dined here (13 months ago) & on their website you can choose 2 or 3 items for each different price & it comes w/ salad & soup. Finally after we had been there already 20 minutes the waiter comes over & says \"are you ready to order\" as if he was waiting on us this while time. I again mentioned that we were on our lunch hour & asked if he know how long stuff would take. He said he didn't know & said everyone came in at once. Um no not everyone came in at once as there was already 10 people seated when we arrived. I looked around at a couple of tables of 4 or 5 people & they were all waiting on everything too. I could tell some of them were looking irritated as well. Since some of our party wanted to partake in AYCE I knew this would take forever! We got up & left right then & there. There's no reason on a Friday at noon that you only have 1 waiter & don't know where your lunch menus are. This was just ridiculous! I've been to the original Jjanga several times & it's always speedy & great. This location on Fort Apache needs to get their act together. Both times I've been there the service has been horrible. Even my other co-workers that have been there a few times said that it's slow but not normally as bad as today. I gave it a 2nd shot & it fell far from expectations. I will never return.",

And if you're hungry is really worth it since the food keeps coming quickly after you order it.",

The only dissappointing things were the fresh men roll which was so awkward to eat and tasted terrible and the baked green mussels were SO BAD. They were dry, had no sauce, and were weird colors.

Other than the stuff she made us, the garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail was the best I've had in Vegas. One other note the staff was all amazing. It was the manager that left a bad taste in my mouth, but contact was minimal. He got really close to my boyfriend and few times, like trying to reach over him almost and when we looked at him he stepped back. Seemed weird and kind of shady. BUT, everything else was so wonderful I'll definitely be back.",

The manager is so nice and the staff is always friendly and welcoming! The food is always prepared to order and DELICIOUS!

I never knew it was there, the parking lot is full but quiet. Inside is a rawring bustling resteraunt with cool vibes.   Free desert treat is given to Yelp reviewers! I thought that was such a cool treat to have posted inside. The food was absolutely amazing. Our table had both vegan and standard rolls selected. The veggie tempura roll is A MUST TRY. I was so pleasantly surprised by its savory and sweet flavor balance.  Service is fast, accurate and genuinely friendly. I offered some critical feedback to the management about some basic things to make the space a little bit better and they were very receptive, even stating that the issue brought up will be addressed. Really cool. Will be back!",

Today came for lunch with just a few tables full and service was horrible. They brought out all my sushi rolls first. Eventually they brought my soup and salad. Forgot my friends soup and saw they tried to bring it to a different table and when that person said it wasn't theirs we thought they would figure it out and bring it but they didn't. Meanwhile all my food was there and either I had to let if get cold or eat in front of my friend (which is rude). Her food took FOREVER to come. We noticed table next to us that came 10-15 after us getting their rolls so I finally flagged down our waitress to ask what was taking so long and she just rudely said it's up to the cooks.   When they finally came back to drop something else off I reminded them about the soup and they finally brought it.   Almost Every time waitress came it was a \"fly by\" to drop something off and before we could say we needed something she was gone.   Asked for more ginger than the little bowl they give You but it never came. Finally left in frustration. Waste of $$",

    "text": "This place is ok for all you can eat sushi, the price is the same as any other average places in Las Vegas. It's a clean restaurant, the only thing that is annoying is that, the hibachi is in an open area next to the tables which makes the whole restaurant smells like fried rice and you could smell it on your clothes after you leave. You usually get seated within 10 minutes and you can start ordering right away, I strongly recommend all you can eat, since it could get pricey ordering 2-3 items off the menu, and don't order any rolls with beef, it's going to taste awful. I would recommend the tiger roll, but any other rolls are just ok, nothing too special. They have a good customer service and fast at serving, they also have a hibachi option.",

We ordered their Karai burger and while the rice bun fell apart and the rice is a bit hard (given they probably want to keep the bun intact), it was still ok. It was a good concept and worth a try but I probably wouldn't get it again especially when there are so many other delicious sushi options.   Got their Stacy's Mom baked roll and it was delish. Also got two orders of sushi, salmon belly and yellowtail. Kind of wish they have toro though.",

They don't take reservations so you may have to wait a little for a seat.  They offer seating for hibachi as well as for sushi.  For a table of two, we waited like 15 minutes or so.  Jjanga had a nice environment, clean, modern, and welcoming.  The servers were very attentive as they came and checked on us regularly.   My soda was always refilled before it was empty.   Which is how I judge a big portion of how the service is.    As for the food...   I got the monkey burrito.   The flavors melded together really well and I really enjoyed the sauce that went with it.  It wasn't too big but it was filling and was about as big as I expected.  My wife got the yum yum roll ($4 for 8 pieces) and the volcano roll ($9 for 8 pieces I believe).   I'm not a sushi expert by any means but it was flavorful and seemed fresh.   Both rolls were extremely good to me.   We also got the bugolgi app.  Thought it was good.  Not great.  Probably would try something else if getting an app next time.   I would definitely go back again.  Plus they have Happy Hour from 3-6 every day which motivates me a bit more.",

They had a sushi burrito on the menu but the server couldn't tell me much about it or even if it was the one we were referring to. He seemed a bit shy and not very knowledgeable. We ordered it anyways and it wasn't everything we hoped. It tasted great but it was small and lacked presentation, not like the one we saw online. Turns out there is another location in LA that the server said \"might be the location we were thinking of,\" but the video specifically said in \"Las Vegas.\"  Seems like if the locations have the same owner, the menu should be identical, but perhaps there was something I wasn't aware of.  The rest of the food was great and I'd most likely return. We were just a bit let down by this sushi wonder, when there is so much buzz about it on the internet.",

The menu is overwhelmingly expansive. The servers were very helpful though, so we quickly dived right in. We love the sushi, which are not overloaded with rice. The beef skewers and baby octopus are delicious. I also loved the Screaming O of the Jjanga Specials. My kids were so happy with green tea ice creamand mochi ice cream.",

This restaurant also offers Hibachi Teppanyaki: where a chef cooks food in front of a large party and serves them (similar to Benihana).  But back to the sushi. Getting seated is often very prompt. You will be asked if you want to order items A La Carte or AYCE and of course, the way to go is the latter. You can order as many rolls and hand rolls and nigiri as you want - with exception to a few items on the list and depending on whether it's available during either lunch or dinner.  My go to items are:  -Screaming Orgasm -Cocain -Salmon and Yellowtail nigiri (multiple orders) -Lisa Hand Roll with added spicy mayo -Apple #1 roll -White Lady roll  And of course you have to get UNLIMITED green tea ice cream and pick a Mochi prior to leaving.  Service near the end of the meal tends to be slow when waiting on the bill. But for the most part, all servers and management are very kind and attentive. I would say I frequent this location about 2 times a month.",

AYCE... reasonable... made-to-order     Lunch - $20.95 (11:30am - 3pm)     Dinner - $25.95 (3pm - 2am)      *Rules:      No Sharing     You'll be charged for leftovers     45 min for lunch/60min for dinner     20% tip added to parties of 6 or more     AYCE cannot be combined w/any promotion  2.  Funny cheeky names for sushi rolls...        - Screaming Orgasm        - Double D       - Something Wrong #69       - Burning Your Ass *Wanna know the ingredients... come on by!  3.  Decor is modern, music isn't too loud (good for conversations), and drinks were constantly refilled.   ** All in all...  Reasonable AYCE price! My favorite thing all night... the oyster on the half, ama ebi (fried head) and Korean ice cream sandwich.  Pass on no rice rolls (not sushi). And the pumpkin soup (pureed).",

I came in with a group of friends for dinner and wanted to do ayce, I didn't even end up getting enough food to justify the price that I paid. Food took far too long to get to the table.

Next time we go in I'll update with her name. For NYE the people across the hibachi table from us bought us a couple rounds of shots. Such a fun night. As to not exclude my daughter the waitress brought over a shot glass with club soda and a gummy bear in it. My daughter is 2.5 so she thought the miniature glass with a candy in the bottom  was so much fun!! The chefs always make sure she gets her own little plate with things cut up appropriately and the waitress brings her an ice cream bar at the end of dinner. It's about the only time we let her have ice cream. The atmosphere is super upbeat, friendly and fun. The food is OUTSTANDING as well. I can't say enough good about the sushi or the hibachi table. We are so happy to have found a new sushi place that is a locals spot. Our old one sold to a new owner and was horrible after. We missed having a place where we walked in and felt that personal feeling and everything we ate was epic. We have finally found it again. Love this place and absolutely recommend everyone eat here on the regular.",

For those of you who haven't been, Denver's a culinary shit hole. Masochists could get full here... they'll keep ordering... but you and I shouldn't.   PROS  - ...  CONS  - 2 waitresses taking orders who didn't communicate between each other  - 4 waitresses serving... everything a la carte... uncoordinated presentation  - everything w seaweed on the outside sticks to adjacent seaweed pieces. inedible.  - octopus was deep fried instead of grilled.  - most sacred roll - the soft shell crab - was missing the crab... so sad.",

The sushi itself was better than most AYCE places that I've been to.  The roll's were not huge but just right.  You can tell the fish was pretty good quality and were unique in flavor and texture.    The service was outstanding and I would highly reccomend checking out",

Not once did I have to wait long for anyone to come over and take my order.  Having acknowledged that let's move on to the food situation. The sushi, whether it be long rolls or nigiri is poorly done. All the long rolls I had ordered had way too much rice and very little fish. The nigiri was also poorly done. The fish to rice ratio was terrible. The quality of the fish itself was okay, nothing to rave about. I found myself sitting and staring at the hibachi tables most of the night. Their food seemed a lot more appetizing than anything I had.   In conclusion the overall experience wasn't bad. There are definitely areas that can be improved. Nobody is perfect.",

Maybe I should've ordered rolls instead of nigiri and appetizers. Asian female server is so rude. She said it was gonna take long for 6 pieces of wings since it was \"big size\"... the wings weren't even seasoned and it was the worst wings I've had to wait 20 minutes for. They were small barely with any meat. I was told by a server per management that since we ordered 5 mochi we couldn't try the crunch bar, limited items I understand but maybe you should say it on your \"specials\" board or let your servers know that guests can't order both. This place has great ratings so I was excited to try it but completely disappointed. Tons of other AYCE sushi options in this city, can't recommend this one.",

Food- food was okay nothing really special all the nigiri are dry, super hard to chew you can tell that its not fresh.  Ive been to a lot of ayce sushi restaurant here in vegas and i'm so sorry theres nothing to compare.  Service- service is good until this one server/bartender came out out of nowhere My friend ordered chicken wings took about 20 minutes (not complaining at all we're just having a convo with my 3 other friends when the chicken wing finally arrived look at the plate it was two very small ones. We all burst out laughing because first our server said its kinda taking forever because its big and they want to make sure that its cooked in the right way. Giving us an imagination that its big or more than 2 pcs maybe 6? But definitely not 2. Second 20 minutes for 2 chicken wings? LOOOL isn't it appetizers to be fast?  So we we're all laughing on our table then this server/bartender came out out of no where saying \"let me know if you just need a bucket\" first of all he wasn't our server and probably he just misheard us and the tone of his voice is rude and sarcastic.   Rolls are okay, like i've said theres really nothing special about this place. I'll just add $5 and eat at a better quality of ayce sushi.  And lastly please double check the tab before paying, i know its the customers responsibility to check before giving his/her card but we we're charged dinner price rather than the happy hour. Just to make sure and learn from our mistake.",

Helpful tip: make a reservation bc they get busy, especially on the weekends. They have special combos for hibachi that include an appetizer and for the price it is worth it. Their hibachi is served with onion soup, ginger dressing salad, fried rice & fries noodles plus whatever proteins you choose. The portions are usually on the bigger side, but the reason for 4 stars is because of their inconsistency in portion sizes. Sometimes they're huge, over flowing the plate and sometimes they are on the smaller side. But the hibachi chefs are all entertaining and make excellent food.",

We went there, and put our name down and was waiting to be seated! There were only 3 parties ahead of us. Then we see people getting seated who came later than us, and we thought they had reservations so we waited patiently. In about 30 minutes we asked the hostess what is going on and how long is the wait. She says 20 more minutes! After 10 more minutes when we checked with her again it turned out someone had crossed our name!!! WHAT THE HECK!!! There were only two people were hosting, one girl and the manager lady! So, who crossed out our name, how did that happened and why!!!!!  After complaining to the manager, she said I will check what happened and I will take care of it! Then we were seated right after, and this is exactly 45 minutes since we were waiting with a baby with us!  After we were seated, we put our order in and first 3 orders came fast! BUT NO PLATES OR UTENSILS!! we were sitting with food in front of us and no utensils to eat with! Again, WHAT THE HECK!!! Then we got the plates and utensils and ate our poorly executed sushi! We put the order for second round and the waiting game began again!! After waiting for about 10-15 with no food coming out, GUESS WHAT?? THEY HAD A MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THE ORDER!!!  Then they bring the order, but the wrong order!!! Again, WHAT THE HECK!! Jjanga, thanks for ruining our first Father's Day which could have been a wonderful experience! I will never go to this place nor recommend this place to anyone!!! But please try to do a better next time for the all the other poor people coming to eat at your restaurant!! If you don't get your act straight , you wouldn't last long I guarantee you that!!",

    "text": "This is a great AYCE sushi spot. They don't use a lot of rice with their nigiri, which is awesome because you don't get full quickly and their service is great and extremely fast. So if you're a nigiri person, this is the place to go. Plus their specials behind the sushi bar are always phenomenal - like how often is salmon belly an option for AYCE?  The only downfall that I really have is that their appetizers are not great and when it was getting busy, the tempura in the rolls was not hot or crispy. We tried multiple appetizers but none of them were winners. It also took a while for some of them to come out and they weren't even great. I was really hoping to love their dynamite but I was disappointed. BUT the shrimp tempura as a appetizer was fresh AF - unlike the ones in the rolls.   Other than that, the pricing is great (comparable with other AYCE sushi spots) and the service is awesome. Like you get your food lightening fast. We will definitely be back for more nigiri and sake!",

    "text": "I'm normally a really big fan of this place. I'm vegan, and I come here because it's the only sushi place that has a wide variety of options for me and offers all you can eat.   Service and time for food to come out has never really been an issue here. I'm not sure if it was our server forgetting to put in orders or the kitchen/sushi line being understaffed, but it took FOREVER for our sushi to come out. There were multiple rolls that we waited 30 minutes for, and it took them AN HOUR to make two little pieces of the vegetable inari. Even though I paid $27 for both my cousin and I to have all you can eat, I felt like I wanted to leave because of how long everything was taking. The two stars is because the food wasn't terrible, and there was someone coming around constantly filling up our teas and water. Our server wasn't terrible- and again, I wasn't sure if it was his fault or the kitchen's- but it kind of sucks when you're trying to enjoy a meal and he keeps having to apologize for multiple things not coming out on time. My other cousin was so appalled by the poor service that she didn't even leave a tip, I felt bad so I threw $20 on the table. I work in a restaurant and I know that poor service isn't always the server's fault- it can be management or whatever.  The rest of the staff seemed pretty careless about their job. I told a girl in the bathroom that one stall was out of toilet paper, and when I went back into the bathroom I saw that instead of properly placing the toilet paper into the dispenser, she carelessly threw it on top.   I will update my review if I come here again and find that the service has improved. It might have been an off night. I don't know. But I wanted to take my cousin out to a nice dinner for her birthday, and the service and time for food to come out really, really just ruined it for us. It also took a long time for our server to bring our check- we had to have someone else bring it to us. I'm not opposed to coming back here- just thought I should leave a review to let management know of the problems I experienced while here and what can be fixed.",

The last couple times, I just came here for dinner before heading to the airport (I live in LA).  I need to make it back for lunch so I can try the sushi tower ... apparently they only have that during lunch!  So far, everything I've ordered has been amazing (sushi burger/burrito/regular rolls) , and their nigori sake was good!  Never had the hibachi, but they have that too.  Shoutout to one of the waiters, Alex -- the first time I came here alone, (bc my friends didn't want to drive that far from the strip), and they weren't that busy so he talked to me almost the whole time, which was so nice of him.  And then when I went back like a few months later, he remembered me haha. All the staff here are super nice & friendly.  I came around 7pm on a Monday the most recent time I went, and even though that seems like peak dinner hours, we got our food SO FRICKIN FAST!!",

Then didn't see the server again and had to stop another female server to help us. But once we got taken care of, all was good. Sushi chefs were great, fish was fresh, great poke! We'll be back.   5-29-19 UPDATE!  My wife and I have made Jjanga our regular place for sushi. Most times 2x a week. I will start this updated review by saying I'm dropping my rate to 2 stars because of how this place has taken a turn for the worse. Service has become terrible. Quality has seemed like it's cheaper product and not at proper temps. Our salmon and tuna were almost luke warm. Most times if we order anything that's from the kitchen it never gets rung in to the point I order again just to see if I get double. Never happens. Trying to order more food is like pulling teeth now. Sad because this place used to SO GREAT!  But let me tell you why we won't be coming back...  My wife and I came in to give Jjanga 1 last shot. We were sat and greeted promptly for drinks. Server came and got our order. Got our food promptly. I'm like Sweet! Maybe it's just been a bump and Jjanga is back on their game!  And then the experience gets ruined! We were eating and all of a sudden this girl that's wearing a pink sweater type thing and black leggings, says to us, we charge for leftovers and you need to finish your sushi rice or we will charge you. I was so taken back as we were still eating our food and my wife eating her roll, that I could say was, we know.  Later, I find her standing over my shoulder pretending to ring in something in the computer(I'm in the biz and know when the POS screen is open). Very annoyed st this point, I look at her and tell her how rude it was of her to come to our table while we are literally still eating and she should probably wait to approach a table like that if they are eating. Her response, a smile!! A smile? No sorry! I didn't think anything was funny! We finished our meal, paid our tab, tipped more than 20% as we always do. As we were walking out, this same girl was at the host stand, not even a thank you, a sorry, not to mention a goodbye.  Ellen and Alex, you guys are great!! But this ruined it for us and sad to say, we won't be coming back Only reason it's a 2 star and not a 1 is because we had a soft spot for Jjanga.",

I got the something wrong roll 69 , eel roll, and fire cracker appetizer. It was all yummy. My lunch even came with miso soup and a salad. My cousins ordered their sushi burger. They had their burger fried for the rice part which you can choose for it to be fried or not. I think if I come try the sushi burger here, I would get it unfried. It reminds me of a sushi burrito but In a burger form. Our server was nice and helped us ordered. He was friendly as well. It's a nice spot and I would recommend this place.",

Oh my god this is my new everything. My world. Words cannot explain the new plane of euphoria that I have reached. I'm smitten. I love you, sushi burger. The rice bun was perfectly crisped on the outside, and chewy on the inside. The filling was falling apart a little as I bit in, but I didn't care. I was in such a state of joy I barely noticed. I imagine the dining hall in heaven serves sushi burgers exclusively. They ARE that good, you guys!",

I usually start my AYCE sushi experiences with appetizers and move onto the rolls/nigiri. My go to appetizers are Baked Green Mussels, Shrimp Tempura, Calamari, and their Soy Chicken Wings. Not used to having chicken wings at a sushi place, but their soy wings were pretty good.  Moving onto sushi, I got a Monkey Burrito, Spider Roll, Tiger Roll, Taste My Ex-Girlfriend Roll, as well as a bunch of Nigiri. I like the rice to fish ratio here as it isn't too heavy on the rice side.   Once our sushi capacity was hit, it was time for dessert. Always room for dessert no matter what. I got the green tea ice cream and mango mochi ice cream. Mochi ice cream is comparable to everyone. The green tea ice cream only had a hint of green tea flavor and mainly tasted like cream.  The service here was great with orders coming out quick. But I felt like our server barely touched base with us compared to other places I've been to.",

We called and left a msg, manager didn't call back. We then called again.",

I'm guessing this is what allows the servers to always be checking on you and for your orders to arrive remarkably fast.   Sushi is good; sushi as sushi can be. Shout out to how they prep their unagi. Tastes really good. A roll with eel in it is a guaranteed sell.   The appetizers are decent. They have 1 order per person mackarel pike and golden scallops. To me they were ok, nothing spectacular. Order the crab balls, the korean fried chicken and their bulgogi. Those are good.  Shoutout to the lady chef managing the sushi bar. Got our orders on time and well prepared.",

They always accommodate us as vegetarians and are sure to not add any animal product like chicken stock into the rice and food. They even cook it first so that our food doesn't touch other people's meat leftovers. 100% recommend if you are looking for some good sushi and amazing service.   I work in the service industry and my favorite part about this place is the team work. Half of the time you don't know who your server is because they ALL help each other. One will take the order, another will refill the drink and a completely different person will close you out. That's probably why this place is always busy and provides amazing food and service.",

Will def be trying it not fried in the next 2-3 days that we're in Vegas for lol.  We've never tried garlic parm edenames. Very very interesting and good.  I love green mussels in general but the mayo on it was cooked to perfection.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",

Finally spoke to a hostess/bartender who still couldn't advise of wait only to guess could be another 30 mins even after two other parties ahead of us walked out too.   Sorry to say this is no way to handle a business.  At the very least keep in communication with your parties waiting so they know you're aware of them.  Don't ignore them and then expect a glowing review.",

Was excited for the sushi burger & sushi burritos I saw on Facebook videos! Came specifically for that. Ordered Jjanga Burger & Monkey Burrito, and my friend ordered the Karai Burger & uni sushi.  Jjanga Burger: Way too saucy and the regular rice bun totally fell apart. Was basically just spicy tuna, spicy mayo, and saucy seaweed salad with a ton of white rice. The seasoning on the bun was really good though!  Monkey Burrito: Preferred this over the Burger - compact and easy to hold and eat! Would've liked some more veggies or something in there, but not bad overall.  Karai Burger: One-time thing, wouldn't get it again. Would rather get a regular roll. Too much rice.   Uni sushi: 2 pieces. The best part of his meal because it was fresh and tasty.  Good service!  Would come back to try AYCE sushi. Looks like they have pretty good happy hour deals too!",

If one or both is not stellar than the finished product will suffer greatly.  We tried a variety of sushi and rolls, all of which were not well executed.  The rice was falling apart at the slightest touch!  The fish was ok, nothing special.  However the oysters were exceptional!  We had those first and thought we had found a real gem, but sadly when the rest of our sushi arrived it was seriously lacking in quality preparation and execution.  I had much better luck at the other JJanga location near Chinatown.",

It wasn't very busy when I went, around 4 tables total in the restaurant. However the service was slow. Our server was so sweet and I'm sure we all have our days that we forget things but when I notice the bartender standing directly behind our table talking with her regulars or friends rather then making the drink I ordered makes this dining experience a fail. I would think that the server would take the initiative to ask the bartender to make her tables drinks.  We finished our food and I told the server to just forget the drink since she said it was still \"on the way\". Once our check came to the table the bartender that was talking directly behind our table had finally returned to the bar and was making her friends their bloody Mary's.... The sushi was good but not good enough to overlook the lack of service.  We ordered a couple different rolls and most of them seemed to contain the same ingredients and all were doused in eel sauce which gives me the impression that the rolls taste the same. It's nice to let the sushi and fish speak for its self. Maybe the other location is better due to being well established.  I guess we will stick with our usual spot.",

Everything was delicious, and the portion sizes were definitely larger than the advertised 3oz of each, because at the end of the meal everyone was stuffed.  They also have a great kids menu for teppanyaki that was priced really well, and last but not least try the Korean ice cream sandwich.  Would definitely come again, and the staff is super friendly.",

    "text": "We just had our first and last hibachi experience at this place . Ugh ! Never had a cook like this in my life . Puts the rice down to cook , proceeds to put all the meat out while the rice is cooking . Literally dropped a piece of raw chicken in the rice . Took him a minute to notice it , just moved it off the rice and proceeds to cook. Maybe I'm crazy but I have a feeling if any other cook dropped raw chicken on the rice he would have started over with a new batch of rice .  On to our steaks , I prefer New York , my husband prefers filet mignon . The chef mixed them up and was preparing  the NY for my husband . We told the cook , he argued for a minute , then realized he was wrong . He takes the NY off the grill and orders another filet mignon ?!? I told him It was a NY , he tells me he's giving me the filet because it's pricier ?!? I don't care about the cost ! I like NY strip . I just decide I'm not going to argue , and deal with the filet . Of course he put a nice full lemon squeeze on top before putting it on my plate ! LEMON on my steak ?!? Ugh !  My lobster tasted like it came out of a frozen bag at Walmart. Sorry but I'm not impressed ! We talked to the manager .. He did take my meal off the bill but there is no way in heck I'm going back to  eat raw chicken fried rice or lemon soaked filet mignon .  We literally paid the 62.00 for my son and husbands meals which they didn't fully eat for various reasons as well and went straight to the Burger King drive thru .",

I chose this location on a recommendation from a friend to impress a number of business associates from Tesla who were in town for training. Needless to say, this experience was horrific. We have continually had to ask our server for the food that we ordered because they cancelled our order on numerous occasions once we entered it. The 5 of us ended up sitting at our table without food for 30 minutes at a time trying to make small talk while we continuously waited on our food. When they did bring us our order it was half of what we ordered and they acted as if they didn't remember the rest. Maybe they are trying to save on food cost - which was a legitimate question asked by everyone in our party. The good news is, if you want alcohol they will bring that RIGHT away! Maybe because it's not \"all you can eat\" and has a high mark up. Overall I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you do decide to try it, I wish you the best but make sure you eat somewhere else first or you may go hungry!",

    "text": "Having been a fan of the original location since it opened, we were stoked to hear the second location opening up closer to our house.  Still pretty new with the \"Kanji\" sign still up and easy to find (right next to DW Bistro). We've only had the AYCE so I don't know how the teppenyaki stacks up.   What I liked: Same menu as original location, bigger space, seems cleaner because of the brighter colors, option for teppenyaki.  What I didn't like: The teppenyaki smell you leave with on your clothes (I feel like my hair smells like teppenyaki even after I get home), they don't accept the punch card from the original location, only open for dinner.  The new location is pretty consistent with the original, same quality fish, rolls are rolled well, hot apps come out hot, etc. Seems a little fancier with all ceramic plates instead of the plastic ones at the old location. Service is the same, kind of hit or miss. Some people are really nice, some a little cold, but you can always flag someone down and get what you need. I really love their riceless rolls and the fact that they don't hound you about finishing every bit of rice on your plate. I'm not one of those people who are trying to skimp on rice so I can shove more fish in my belly - I just don't want the extra carbs (female vanity thing).   Overall, a great option if craving AYCE in Vegas. We've tried our fair share of different places and Jjanga by far has been one of the most consistent and fresh (well, as fresh as AYCE fish goes, it's no Kabuto or Soho) places. Pretty normal pricing for AYCE, but nice with riceless rolls and a decent variety of apps.",

I kept saying to my husband \"this just be an off day for them, because how do they have 4 1/2 stars and that many reviews!!!\" We had to flag the waiter down 5+ times for water refills for the table(and he would still forget) it appeared he was in a rush to take his lunch break which he did right in the middle of our meal. Mind you there were only 3 tables (ours included) occupied in the entire restaurant. That in itself was super annoying. I won't be back, we will stick with sushi Koma.... at first we thought what a bummer, for the first time Yelp stared us wrong. Actually, it's our fault for it realizing the majority of the reviews are for the hibachi, which is probably outstanding.",

We did not make a reservation so it was a miracle a party of six was able to make it to hibachi within 30 minutes. We had an awesome hibachi chef. He was hilarious and put on an awesome show. Our food was great and there was no shortage! The house sangria is delicious and so is the house made sake sampler. We also did 2 rounds of sake bombs! I personally think it tastes better with plain cold sake but the flavored isn't too bad either. Benja is awesome and took great care of us!",

My girlfriend and I, who both work in the Vegas service industry, were excited to try a new establishment. With open minds, we still knew Jjanga had some strong competition.  Jjanga exceeded all expectations in every realm of a sushi place. I never in my life had fresher sushi (all meats shipped in everyday), the ambiance is progressive, beautiful and unique, the prices are unbelievable for the quality and the service is nothing under top notch.  Jung knew Jjanga like the back of his hand. He was patient, knowledgeable, honest and more than a server, but a friend we just met that night. We will request him every time. Yet even beyond this, other servers were genuinely concerned with our well being and satisfaction.   This is the first review I've ever written in which I have nothing negative to say about am establishment, for constructive criticism of course.   Goodbye other sushi joints, thanks for the good times but we'll be at Jjanga from now on.",

They only thing I would recommend is that if you do plan on coming on a weekend, they're most likely going to be packed so call ahead for reservations.",

I did not want to order an appetizer and asked a couple questions about the nigiri. The person couldn't answer and sent someone else. I tried to order and they explained that I needed to order with the chef. I ordered a couple items though it was hard to get their attention. They didn't ask for my friend's order and didn't really make eye contact. Usually when I order sushi, everyone is attentive and checks back to see if anything else is needed. I felt like I placed my order three times. It was just confusing.   The Japanese Lasagna was good and not too cheesy/ filling like some I have had. I also liked the white fish / nigiri. I got a crunchy roll and that one I didn't like.   There was a woman there with two kids. The boy was running around the table with squeaky shoes and it was pretty loud and annoying. My friend asked an employee if they could say something to the woman since it went on and on. Though it was the mom's fault for allowing it, it ruined the vibe a bit. I go to restaurants like this to relax and enjoy a meal and not have kids running around. The employee did mention it and eventually the squeezing stopped.   I would go back because of the location and proximity to where I live and work but I would honestly say the place was pretty average.",

You cant order half rolls which is a bummer but wise on there part  Servers take forever to get our orders. They would grab our empty plates and leave in a hurry.

Nothing about their sushi is \"buffet quality\". Our faves include Taste Like My ExGirlfriend, Next Time, and Screaming O. Btw, they deliver through GrubHub!!!!",

My boyfriend and I did a la carte our first time eating here, and the total came out to $50, so we figured eh we should just do AYCE next time since we're spending the same amount.  The interior of the restaurant is very spacious, clean, and modern. The have an area for either Sushi or Hibachi (like Benihana style). I have yet to try their Hibachi menu - however, what I really appreciate about their sushi menu is the addition of new and exclusive items. I was tired of seeing the same items at every, single sushi restaurant like the Hawaiian roll, Vegas roll, etc etc. This place actually had brand new, creative concoctions!  I HIGHLY recommend the Sponge Special Sushi Roll. It is a tempura roll with so much fresh goodness and looks like a sushi masterpiece. Their nigiri (salmon belly and white tuna) are also very high quality with a great fish-to-rice ratio. The fish practically melts in your mouth! Wow I think my mouth just watered...",

We ordered an array of appetizers, from grilled mackerel to Korean fried chicken and a bunch of others, with all of them tasting fresh and delicious! Our water cups were never empty in between food, and our waitress was kind and accommodating.  When it came to the sushi, we ordered a variety of nigiri.

And I was with a group of HANGRY PEOPLE- way hungrier than me actually! SHOCKING I KNOW! But since I'm very proficient in getting what I want.... After a good 20 minutes of waiting (I could see the heads of those I was with BOILING WITH HUNGER RAGE) I stood in front of the host table not bitchy by any means, but I kept a stern expression on my face... And it worked because the hostess made an acceptation for us, setting up a tepinyaki (sp?) table for us sushi eaters even though the sign said this is not possible...   When we were seated, we were initially IGNORED and we thought this would be the theme for our meal but NOPE! Once our waitress came to us, our food ESSENTIALLY FLEW ONTO THE TABLE in almost no time! My husband ordered a rather intricate roll but BAM, it came out in negative two seconds! And my crispy salmon skin handrolls, those also landed on the table in record timing! The rest of the group was just as happy with the service speed because soon enough they were human enough to talk without biting anyone's head off! Ha!   The concept of ALL YOU CAN EAT here is pretty great, as long as you don't make ANY MODIFICATIONS... But my whole order was modified thanks to my food \"issues\" (intolerances/allergies people).... This NOTHING was counted as all you can eat, but OHHHHH WELL. My husband made up for that, and while the first 4 rolls he got were tasty, the last one made him HATE sushi - lol! He had to be \"rolled\" out of the restaurant, and felt VERY SICK the rest of the night, but not to the point that he had to hang out in the bathroom. This just goes to show that you should PACE YOURSELF if you do the ALL YOU CAN EAT \"challenge\"... Ha!   We all can see why this place gets good Yelp reviews, the food is fresh and delicious (my mom was obsessing over her uni and salmon roe) and everyone else adored their eats! Yum Yum!",

We came for AYCE lunch just so we could eat some Monkey Burritos! They are under the Special Hand Rolls section of the menu, and are easy to overlook with all the other choices on the menu. Don't overlook these!!!   We tried one of each of the special hand rolls, and the Lissa hand roll was pretty good. The Monkey Burrito is by far my favorite. I think it is a combo of the delicious soy paper and the sauce they serve on the plate. Mmmmm! It is served as two pieces, and they are the perfect serving size.  Of course I always order some yellowtail, so we had some Yuzu Yellowtail nigiri and hamachi. The Something Wrong 69 is a good roll.. very filling! There is a roll that is mostly yellowtail and it is amazing. The mussels are our favorite appetizer.  The service is sometimes hit or miss. We were only drinking water and it was not busy when we were here, so we didn't have any service issues. The sushi chef was a female, and she is very attentive and fast.   The prices for both lunch and dinner AYCE are very reasonable. You can get a lot for your money here. It has a very clubby vibe and is a bit loud...very fun and energetic!",

I just ate here at 10:30 PM, and the freshness was very low.  I feel like this place has potential if they can step up the quality of ingredients and get better sushi chefs that can make tidy rolls. As it is now, despite the unique and interesting special rolls, I honestly feel it deserves 2 stars. Most rolls are sloppily made and the freshness of fish and roe just isn't acceptable.

The menu is well organized by types of rolls (shrimp tempura, spicy, veggie, etc). We ordered some appetizers and a few rolls to start. The fish was fresh and the apps were good. The gyoza were tasty, but a little doughy. Not the best we've had. The specialty rolls were huge, stuffed with fish and the sauces were awesome. We were happy with the food, but the service really slowed down by the end of the meal. They dropped our check and it took at least 10 minutes for them to come pick it up. We will definitely return, but maybe for lunch.",

Although I loved their food, the service sucked. It took forever to seat us, and the waiter barely checked up on us. He was gone for the most part during our lunch. I'm usually understanding if the place is busy, but it wasn't. There were only a few tables, and it still took him a while to get to us.",

He provided superb recommendations on delicious sake, appetizers, and rolls.  10/10 would recommend Jjanga.",

Fish is always fresh, flavor is amazing, sake choices are great, and there is so much to choose from on the menu!   Some personal favorites are the house peach sake, Screaming 'O', Cocaine, Calamari, Monkey burrito, Jackpot Roll, Something Wrong #69, and so much more....  Service is always great, there have a been a few mix-ups when I've gone at peak times, but nothing too crazy and always understandable. They've always done something to make it right whether it be a comped drink or whatever.  The restaurant is very cozy and inviting. Seating is comfortable and plentiful. Lighting is perfect.   I'm thinking of going back tonight :) it's been too long.",

Absolutely NO Sharing between AYCE customer & A LA CARTE customer. 2. You will be charged A LA CARTE prices for LEFTOVERS including SUSHI RICE. 3. Ordering time is limited to 45 minutes for lunch & 1 hour for dinner. Dining time is not limited. 4. Parties of 6 or more will be charged a service fee of 20%. 5. AYCE cannot be used in conjunction with any promoted coupon, bonus card redemption.  It's a little off-putting. Also, the 20% added on parties of 6 or more is a service fee. Not a gratuity.",

They have a all you can eat sushi menu which includes the sushi burritos. Some items are reserved for dinner only. They also serve Teppanyaki. As much as we wanted to indulge in the all you eat sushi menu we had a pool party to look forward to that day. I got their sushi burrito, which was okay. It wasn't anything special. It was basically a Cali roll in a burrito with a side of spicy mayo and eel sauce mix. BF got their panko deep fried sushi burger slider sampler. Which came with versions of their sushi burgers in a slider size. Jjanaga burger: spicy crab, spicy tuna. Karai burger: spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab mix,salmon. And the bulgogi: thinly sliced Korean bbq beef. The fried panko breading on the rice buns really made a difference in texture. It seemed to hold up a bit better than the regular sushi burgers we've tried before. The flavor combos on each were good.   Overall really enjoyed this spot. Can't wait to come back to try the all you can eat sushi menu next time we are in town.",

    "text": "A group of us met here for teppanyaki.  This was one of the best times I've had in a restaurant in a long time. Of course, in most restaurants, we wouldn't be laughing, calling to each other, have a chef toss fresh eggs with a spatula, and just plain have a lot of noisy fun.  I ordered the basic dinner with the add ons of lobster and filet. We all got soup, a salad, and then watched as our well trained, very experienced, and very funny chef did his magic cooking noodles, fried rice, doing the almost required flaming onion tower, and then cooking the proteins.  I had asked for my filet to be extra rare and that's the way it was. The meat was very tender and tasty and the lobster was very flavorful. My soda was refilled often and service was excellent.   As must be the case with teppanyaki, a chef who is a ham as well as being proficient is a must and ours was! He had a great personality, was full of life, made a lot of silly jokes, made us all laugh, and cooked things exactly as we ordered. Getting the steaks cooked the correct way was a fine accomplishment. Periodically, Jjanga would stop by and ham it up with our table. He's a fun person and a very personable guy!  While I don't do teppanyaki often, this will be the place I come the next time I want to have a dinner show with some good food.",

Once we got the bill, I quickly paid, yet while we were waiting for our server, a cockroach started climbing up the wall beside my daughter. When we told the waiter, he simply said \"okay\" and grabbed the roach with a napkin like it was no big deal. By that time, we already lost our appetites and quickly left.

I only liked the shrimp and veggie tempura, edemami and the gyoza...noone can mess these up...so we are moving on to the rolls!This is where it gets really interesting: So I asked for a baked one and I  ordered Alaskan Roll If you frequently go to Kabuki you know what it is like...so nothing to compare to those...next is Surf and Turf...dont even think about what you always get at Oyshi...its something far fetched from it...bottom line you have to come here with a very opened mind and see what happens you might like it you might not but let me share it with you if you dont like what you get you will be charged for the rice! Im not kidding! Read the small letters on the All you can eat menu...Also we got the bill be4 my mango mochi arrived so I have no info on that either...not my cup of sushi nor place to return so I decided to give an extra star for the staff polite effort",

Service at the bar was polite and attentive. Location is also outfitted with hibachi seating.   The Karai burger on panko bun is $11 and so enormous I couldn't fit it in my mouth without removing the top bun- and I can fit a lot of stuff in my mouth, so already I was impressed. The bun bottom bun held up well despite being overtaxed by the full load. I actually ended up setting it down and forgetting the bun altogether to eat the toppings off with chopsticks about halfway in, because I was getting full. The soft shell crab, salmon, crab, and sauces combined well and were complemented by fresh, crunchy lettuce. The portion alone is worth the price, I left more than sated.",

Starting with some nigiri, we ordered salmon, Cajun albacore, garlic tuna & tobiko. All tasted so good, but the garlic tuna really stood out!   After we finished our nigiri we ordered.... more nigiri! And some rolls! The rolls that really stood out were the red rock, playboy & dancing eel. All 3 of those rolls were just outstanding, we'll definitely be ordering those next time we're here!   As for some other items we ordered! The calamari was great, French Fries are a must, & the golden scallop you can never go wrong with.   Finally, service was awesome through the entire night! Staff made sure our cups overflowed & we had plates of food in front of us. They have a decent little bar too!",

The Salmon was so fishy and all the pieces were all room temp. Do you guys realize you have to store your food so it stays cold. Nobody wants to eat warm sushi. The service was horrible, everything was so slow and the bus boys did not clear any of our dishes off of our table not once. By the time we ordered dessert there was 15 dishes still on the table. It just baffles me how this place was rated so high.",

    "text": "The quality of the food is not bad for the price. We had a table of 8, and 3 of us were doing AYCE, while the other 5 ordered A La Carte. Two things really bothered me:   1) When we were ordering for the AYCE, 2 out of 3 of us had ordered when we were told by the server \"I think this is enough for now.\" However, the 3rd person still wanted to add 3 more orders of sushi but the server repeated the same thing, so goes without saying, we did not get the 3 extra order. After our first round was finished he acted really surprise that we finished, when we told him from the get go that we were going to be ordering a lot, but that we will definitely finish. I get that they do not want people ordering food and wasting by not finishing. If he had said what he did during our second round of ordering, then I would understand, but during the first round? No. If we did order too much and did not finish, and he told us once, then charge us for the waste, there is no need to repeat. Needless to say, we finished everything.   2) We constantly had this one person (perhaps the manager) that was always walking by our table. Yes, I get it that you wanted to make sure that no one ordering AYCE was sharing with those that ordered A La Carte but do you have to walk by that many times? He might as well have sat down and watched us eat.   Overall, the quality of the food was good, but the service needs improvement. There's more subtle ways to go about doing what they did/say. Also asked for an extra sake cup, and napkins, numerous times before we got the things we requested. At times they put the A La Carte items on the side the 3 AYCE people were sitting. We even grouped ourselves like so to make things easier for them to serve and monitor (as they were doing) us too, but that did not work out.",

A lot of fun  My mom and I use to be regulars there. Suddenly everything started to change. The service got slow, the food mediocre, and the hostess was rude. We had to walk up to the counter to pay without even receiving a check yet. When we asked the hostess to combine our cards (yes they were from the same location) she refused. My mom and I refuse to go back now!",

No one checked on me, asked if I needed anything else and then when I tell the rude incompetent server I'm ready for my check, she disappears for so long I decide to walk up front to check out. The two guys up front also completely rude and don't care about the shitty service that's going on. Whatever, wouldn't be back if this was the last place to eat on earth.",

To make a long story short, the last hour of service sucked, no napkins, plates or chopsticks was given . Had to get our own stuff ! The hot tea I ordered was lukewarm water that was served twice !!! And they charged me !!! So I told the waiter to remove it from the tab , then he gives me back the \"corrected\" tab , and the hot tea was still on the tab ! I spoke to the lady manager and all she could say was \"sorry\" . Well , that's that . Jjanga, you just lost a patron , that will spread the word :)",

    "text": "Last night was my second time at this location. First time, two weeks ago, was a pleasant experience enjoying dinner with a group of workers from our-of-state corporate office, 5 in total. We were seated right away at 6pm, and by 7:30 we were done, already paid and wrapping up when a male manager approached our table and requested us to leave since there were many people waiiting to be seated. We were all disappointed by the request, being the first time we were ever requested to do so at any restaurant, we still did nicely and politely.   Last night, we went in (7 people) for dinner and were seated in the same section as the first time, and got the same server. We all chose AYCE and barely started ordering appetizers when, again for the first time ever at an AYCE sushi place, the server said we were ordering too much. I could see her later talk to other servers who were taking quick glances at our table. Must I say that I lost appettie over their attitude? Food was good, but not enough to take rude comments from servers and being looked upon as hungry gluttonous people. There are other AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas who will welcome a party of 7 who will pay as much as we did, with a generous tip,  considering that we ordered items from a-la-carte as well, and who will not give you rude comments.",

We like the options their entire menu offers compared to other sushi places in the area because they have a wide variety of appetizers and skewers and non-fish options for those who don't eat sushi that much. I also like how their menu is laid out by grouping their specials, spicy rolls, deep fried rolls, baked rolls, etc.  Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I wish they allowed half roll orders so you could try more rolls during your visit without having to stuff your face.  I think they also just started doing their late night happy hour like their Decatur location which is $20.95 AYCE Mon-Sat from 11pm-2am.  Also don't forget to get a stamp card!! But you can only redeem your free AYCE if you come in with your card fully stamped - you can't redeem your free AYCE the same visit as when you reach it.",

There's enough on the menu that after two visits, I still haven't tried all the rolls I'd like. It's best to go with a friend so you can share and sample a bunch of different rolls. So far, the yellow yellow roll and sexy time roll are favorites.   It is all-you-can-eat so if you're a sushi snob, it's probably not gonna be your thing. But if you just want some yummy sushi for lunch or happy hour or whenever, it's great.   My only complaint is that I cannot be trusted at any all-you-can-eat establishment. I always eat more than I can handle. Both times I've been here I ate myself into a food coma.",

The salmon hand roll was delicious, and the skin was perfect. The sashimi was really good!   The ambiance is nice and warm. I'm definitely a fan of the music playlist here.",

    "text": "This review is based on my to go order. I'm not huge on sushi rolls, but that's usually my go to at places like this for to go. I ordered the sexy time roll. It was crispy rice with spicy tuna and jalapenos on top. I recently became a fan of this because Sushi Roku does the best version of this that I have ever seen. It was decent, but the spicy tuna just kept falling apart and crumbling away. It was very difficult to eat. Next, I got Stacy's mom roll. That one was very good.. satisfied my sweet tooth for something more on the rich side. Lastly, I got the Joe's special roll. It was shrimp tempura and cucumber inside, and tuna and avocado on top with spicy ponzu . I really liked this roll, however the shrimp inside was stale and hard. It tasted like a shrimp that had been fried but unused for at least a couple hours. Overall, it did satisfy my craving and I will be back. My only suggestion is that maybe they can do newly fresh fried shrimp on to go orders ... seeing as how you are paying 3x the price for to go instead of patronizing the all you can eat option .",

I wanted to give 5 stars so bad because their fish is fresh, their fish:rice ratio is nearly perfect, the location seemed clean, and the variety for the lunch menu was awesome!!  The heavy use of sauce and cream cheese just kept me from clicking that last star.  Many of the baked and deep fried rolls have cream cheese.  I'm pretty sure you could ask them to skip it, but I thought I'd give the menu, as it is, a fair shake.  There are some fresh rolls that are killer, I had the Washington, the Double D, TNT, Johnny, and a dozen nigiri orders (all of which were perfect).  The Double D is my favorite so far, but I haven't tried their rainbow roll, which is by far my favorite.  All that raw fish.  And even if you don't like raw fish, but you somehow end up at about sushi place, they do veggie and cooked rolls.  I'll be coming back here whenever I'm in town.    Thank you for satisfying my need for fresh sushi, Jjanga!",

Her name was JJ and heard she was training but you can't train someone with an attitude from the start and playing it off fake later. We had a dish sent back and that's what's set off the whole experience cause when another server took the dish back and reported to our main server she had an expression of a dirty look. So I requested another server to help us since JJ was not very attentive and her presence disgusted me. Her appearance was not very professional with hoop earrings and piercing on her face as well. What an unfortunate first time.",

Their ingredients are fresh and everything tastes incredible. The vegetable and shrimp for here is easily one of the best I've had. All other sushi rolls are incredible, With many choices spanning from spicy to non spicy choices, sushi featuring  shrimp tempura, sushi without rice, vegetarian options, and one can easily ask for any sauce on the side.  They also have baked options of sushi that come in many combinations. They have many items on the menu having nothing so do with sushi which opens the menu up to pretty much everyone.  Along with this, they offer dessert, an impressive array of Sake, and the service is very friendly.  They do have Teppanyaki tables and they have a bar.  Dinner, all you can eat, is $24.95, while lunch all you can eat is about $20.95.  I have come here 5 times already, and each time is really good!  Highly recommended!",

The rice that they use for their nigiri sushi was not seasoned. It was just plain white rice with no flavoring. I was a bit shocked. Also, the quality of the fish were not that great compared to my other go-to AYCE sushi place. I didn't get too many rolls, maybe one at most, since I'd rather eat the nigiri's. I'm not a huge roll fan, so if the rolls here are amazing, maybe this place is legit than I realize.   I appreciate their wide selection of other food items they offer; however, all the other items were mediocre at best. The crab ball was the only thing that I liked, and probably ordered multiple times.   There's a clubby, fun vibe here, that some may really like. Perhaps I was too sober to enjoy the food.",

    "text": "For awhile I was going to the location on Decatur because I use to work in the area. This location recently opened just a few min down the street from where I live.  No restaurant is perfect every visit in service, quality, price etc AND there is no perfect all you can eat sushi restaurant anywhere (each one has it's good and bad) but this place definitely has earned all 5 stars.    Service so far is consistent and VERY friendly, price for all you can eat is the same as everyone else, their ala carte prices are FANTASTIC $3 for all their basic sushi rolls and they are the same size and quality as anywhere else. Their tepenyaki prices are probably the best in town. The portions and quality are far better then some other places too.  Geisha House used to be great and they have gone way down hill over the last 2-3 years.  The tepenyaki show to me is average I think that's because I've seen it so many times over the years from so many different places that it doesn't really thrill me anymore (especially since tepenyaki has become more mainstream as well). With that in mind, I'm also ok with the show being average as long as the price, portion and quality of food is there and it DEFINITELY is.  Also their sauces are NOT the typical 3 sauces you find at other places. Theirs is SO much better!    I've read that a few people gave them low stars because something was forgotten. Trust me it's not intentional and everyone here is eager to please.  From everything I've seen on all my visits now  (I've already been there at least 6 times since they recently opened) and every visit has been great and I continue to recommend this place and have brought my family there as well and we RAVED about it for 2 days!!! They will DEFINITELY fix the situation for you. I am led to believe it was a customer problem.   Quality of their food (sushi or tepenyaki) is excellent.    Again, no sushi/tepenyaki restaurant in this city is perfect but they do a fantastic job in all categories and you are definitely missing out if you don't go here!!",

Our server was kind and gave us first timers some great recommendations. The sushi chef even prepared something off menu for us. It was a refreshing gesture you're rarely graced with. Second, the food is great. They have a HUGE variety of rolls with off the wall names. Our favorites tonight were \"tastes like my x girlfriend\" and \"the cowboy\".

    "text": "$26 for an AYCE sushi isn't a bad deal, especailly at Jjanga, where the food is way above average for an AYCE, ambiance is upscale (again way above your typical sushi joints), and number of dishes available are way way above average.  This place is a bona fide gem, a place we plan on coming back to frequently.  Let me get the couple of minor negatives out of the way.  First, the service was not bad by any means, but not necessarily great.  Maybe it's on purpose to slow down the ordering, but the attentiveness wasn't exactly proactive.  We had to flag down the wait staff to get our orders in past the initial order, and the table next to us actually left complaining they were not getting any attention.  Once that happened, however, the service picked up.  So it may have been an anomaly, but as it was, it gets a passing grade but not exactly an A.  Second, the fish portion of the nigiri were smallish, although I liked that the entire nigiri was modest in size as well.  I hate when the nigiri pieces are so monstrous that you need to take two bites to eat a piece.  The positives are numerous: 1) Quality of the fish were comparable to what you would find at very good sushi joints.  Not on par with the top-of-the-line, but it's also not $90 pp either. 2) The quality of the menu is outstanding.  They have dishes you just don't find at AYCE, such as amaebi, uni, oysters, several sashimi dishes, and about 10,000 roll dishes.  Note that for some of these high-end dishes, it's one order per person max each.  Still, get one of each and you'll be more than full.  And then you still have unlimited orders of some of my faves, saba, ikura, albacore, hamachi, etc.  Also has couple dozens of appetizers, desserts, and several choices of soups.   3) Great, upscale decor and lively atmosphere, topped off with k-pop music.  TVs all over the place so it's also good for game days.  Seating could use some improvement, I don't like those stools... 4) We didn't partake, but the hibachi is a good complement. 5) Some of those servers were cute!  All-in-all this is a can't miss, high-bargain restaurant that doesn't make you feel cheap for seeking an AYCE.  I rate the food 4.5, atmosphere 4.5, and service 3.5 for a solid 4.5 stars.  I'll round down, hoping their service matures enough for a full 5 star rating next time around.  Table-for-1 Factor:  They have sushi bar with at least a dozen seats, and I can see myself noshing on my own despite the festive atmosphere that may suggest otherwise.",

    "text": "This review is for the sushi portion only. We haven't tried the Hibachi yet, but plan to.  There's a lot of sushi places and the all you can eat sushi places are more common now than ever. That being said, very few get it right. There are some that score highly with certain aspects e.g. atmosphere, food quality, service, etc. but hardly ever do any of these types of places get everything right. Well.. this one does.  Walking in, you'll soon realize how big this place is. It's big enough to have both a hibachi area with multiple tables and a designated sushi area complete with a full sushi bar. Ambiance is nice and modern but still with some of that traditional flavor. I especially liked that the walls had large stylized posters of their hibachi and sushi chefs. One of them was even wearing a captain america mask with a train whistle -- his name was \"choo choo.\" I could already tell i'd like this place.  We were greeted by a man named Nate who made sure throughout the entire time we were there that we were enjoying ourselves and being taken care of. After he sat us, he'd stop by multiple times to ask if everything was okay, give us suggestions, and even drink with us. The thing is, he wasn't even our server. To be taken care of to that extent by someone who wasn't even your server is pretty awesome. On that note, our server, Antonio, was also excellent. He had a really bright personality and was extremely helpful with recommendations, having conversations with us, the whole experience. He was really funny and also gave his all to make sure we were having a good time and that we were enjoying the food. I never had to flag him down or ask for refills or anything. We were sitting at the sushi bar which limited our interaction with the server, but he was great. Nate and Antonio are awesome and I hope to see the both of them again whenever I come back (which will be often).   Okay, now on to the meat of the review. To put it bluntly, the food is very good. We tried a bunch of the nigiri, rolls, appetizers, and drinks. I'm big on nigiri and can't say I had anything I didn't like here. My personal favorites were the garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail. Not only does the food here taste good, but the presentation is also excellent. Rolls were also really good. I liked the Joe's Special and Fresh men which had no rice. Some of the names of the things are crazy like \"something wrong #69\" and my personal favorite \"burning your ass.\" Although we sat at sushi bar, we didn't catch the sushi chef's name but she was very attentive and quick. You can tell this place is serious about good food, but also has a sense of humor which shows in the menu and in the service. Nate made us some shots that we had never hear of or had before and all of them were really good. We had green tea shot, gummy bear shot, and a green sour one that I think only Nate knows how to make. Everyone liked all of them and we are definitely coming back for more.  Overall, I have to rate this place 5 stars. I honestly can't think of a single complaint or issue. We all likes the atmosphere, service, food, and really enjoyed ourselves. If you like AYCE sushi and want to have a good time, this is the place to go. We haven't tried the hibachi side yet, but we definitely want to. Since it's JJANGA, i'm sure it's going to be awesome.",

I should have read the bad reviews and paid attention to them rather than allowing the other reviews persuade me into eating here. Poor sushi quality, salty appetizers, and poor customer service! I don't understand what all the hype is about?  When we went, the place rarely had customers in it unlike our usual sushi place, where it's always packed because of the quality of food and service.  Were the reviews all made by their employees? The price is the same as our favorite AYCE sushi restaurant BUT we are definitely NOT coming back to this place.",

We were here after 11pm which is their happy hour. The all you can eat price is LUNCH price, but the red items are not available unless you want to pay non-happy hour pricing (regular dinner price). The server explained this very clearly which I love! The service here is AMAZING!!!! The servers are so fast and efficient. Ellen and Moon are awesome! Customer service is on point. When we ordered our first batch of nigiris and rolls, they came out SO QUICKLY, I was so impressed. I have been to so many other sushi places and they're not as quick as Jjanga sushi. I love this fish here. SO FRESH and delicious. For rolls, try the double D roll and burning your ass roll. Yummmm!!!! For the nigiri, I LOVE THE Garlic tuna, YUZU yellowtail (please also order yuzu yellowtail sauce on the side), salmon, superwhite tuna, albacore. Yummy!",

    "text": "Went here with my boyfriend and some friends for my first time. I had heard lots of good things before trying it, so I was excited. I tried a variety of rolls and nigiri. Their fish is what you call quality and it was all fresh which is always a plus. The cuts of nigiri were the perfect size and the ratio between the fish and rice was on point. I feel like some sushi spots tend to put too much rice. I loved that they had a no rice roll section. Try the spring mountain and the tuna naruto roll. Super bomb! The staff was super friendly and they came by with chef's specials and samples of drinks. I wanted to give them five stars because everything tasted amazing and everyone was so nice, but I think the staff was also slightly overwhelmed that night. I was with five other people and we noticed that from our first order, we had three rolls missing and a few orders of nigiri missing. So I had ordered my missing rolls and nigiri again and just figured they were really busy. I eventually got my nigiri and still wasn't brought a roll that was missing the first time around. My friend asked the waitress about it so it came out soon after. Throughout dinner my friends had experienced the same thing with some of the items they ordered which was a little frustrating since they had the time to make us samples, but didn't accurately deliver our order.. Other than that, I enjoyed the food and would definitely come again. The service could do some improving but other than that, I can't complain.",

I use to drive from Centennial Hills just to go there when there are plenty of other sushi restaurants who have almost the same menu offerings.   The rice to fish ratio is twice what it use to be. Rice is cheaper than good quality fish. The new ownership is more concerned with the bottom line than good, quality food and service. The last time I was there, one person got sick after eating the sweet shrimp.   We had ordered drinks from the bar and we had to ask the server why our drinks hadn't been served. She quickly told a gentleman, who was more of a manager than server, comes over with our drink order. Now, if you want soda, that come quickly. But if you want sake, you're going to wait.   As much as I use to love it when Jjanga was there, I won't be going back again. As much as I'll miss the grapefruit sake, the food doesn't justify the repeat business.",

I admit it held everything in together but I don't recommend ordering the fried bun. Instead, just don't do it fried because in my case, it ruin the experience. It was too hard and crunchy like a mouth full of dry cereal without milk. Think that, but harder.  I will go back and try it again without the fried rice bun because I loved the bulgogi inside it.   I also gave the Sushi burger 3 stars because it was too expensive for something that didn't satisfy me. A sushi burrito is much bigger and worth the price. I bought 3 burgers at a total of $30.   However, I still need to try out the dine-in hibachi and sushi experience. Btw you only get a stamp card if you dine-in and not take-out.",

It also had a wide variety of appetizer and even different types of sushi burritos. I got the udon soup and thought it was very yummy.  We started ordering different rolls from different categories. I honestly enjoyed all of them! They were all freshly made and tasted like a regular roll you get from anywhere else. It blew my mind that sushi rolls tasted this good for only $20 at lunch. I will definitely be coming back if I'm ever in town again.   Also if you write a review, you get a Korean ice cream sandwich which is very yummy! :)",

We order nigiri which that took a whole hour to bring out of server said that they forgot to bring it out so they had to remake it, which when it came out it didn't even taste fresh we spent over 245 dollars and wasn't worth it at all. For it being our 1st time there it definitely makes me not want to go back. I understand having a big group but that should never happen.   our server was super nice and great but damn that food service was just horrible!!",

    "text": "AYCE made to order sushi?! Yes, please.   I'm always really skeptical of buffet sushi because the quality tends to be poor at most places. Not the case here. All dishes are made to order.   I've been to Jjanga twice, and both times I have left extremely full and satisfied. The all you can eat menu is $20.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner. The fish was fresh, and there are so many options on the menu, so I think the price is more than fair. My favorites are the pink lady and candy cane rolls. Their hand rolls are also delicious, and you can't go wrong with traditional nigiri. Note that you will be charged for leftovers, and you're limited to 45 min of ordering time for lunch and 1 hour for dinner -- basically, strategize a little and don't over-order! The menu is HUGE, so it might make sense to look at it online first to get a general sense of what you might want to order. Make the most of your ordering time, and enjoy.",

What pissed me off was when the owners friends came in  (I'm sure the 2 guys he hugged were his friends,)and ordered, they got their food within 15 minutes. We were there an hour! It was not busy and there were 2 sushi chefs just talking to each other. I remember the chef had this obnoxious graffiti hat.

They do all you can eat, but I came here to try their fabled new \"Sushi Burger\" which unfortunately is not part of the all you can eat menu.  The first thing we noticed was the great music. Classics like Sinatra and the Beach Boys.  We ordered the Jjanga Burger, the Bulgolgi Burger, and the Unagi Burger. We went with the panko encrusted rice buns which I believe was a mistake. The buns were hard, and not easy to eat. Next time I would go with the regular rice bun.  The kicker was the service. Not terribly busy but definitely a healthy amount of patrons, but our service was slow, unresponsive, we felt forgotten a few times, and the check was pushed on us without us asking for it which made us feel that we had to leave.  They did give us free ice cream which was very nice.",

    "text": "Saw a facebook video about this place on Facebook, SUSHI BURGERS! I was so excited to try it since we were visiting Vegas from Phoenix, AZ. I decided to get an Alaska roll since that is my go to simple roll as an appetizer. It came to the table and it was so bad. I have always liked Alaskan rolls everywhere and this place managed to make it bad.  Moving on to the BURGER. I got the bulgogi burger not fried. The bulgogi was so sweet and sticky and the sauce was thick. Not like bulgogi at all. Tasted terrible. My boyfriend got the JJANGA burger with friend rice buns, it was messy and it fell apart. He did not eat much of it.  We saw a sign that said free dessert with a 5 star review so that's why this restaurant has a 4 star overall rating. Its a shame that people will spend their money here.   Now both my boyfriend and I want to barf after this nasty food. So sad that we had to leave Vegas on this bad note.",

Let me tell you the service in this place is great. The food all came out super fast and it was all pretty delicious. My fav would have to be the spicy tuna crunch. So good and lots of flavor.   Sundays they also have brunch and you're able to do bottomless mimosas, sake, and Japanese beer for $20!   They also have great options for children which was nice since I have a two year old.  She had the fried rice and French fries. She loved it.   I'll def be back. Food was tasty. Service was great.",

We had a party of six, and all prefer to eat light because of our diet. We decided to get three meals that included four items each. For those of you who do not know each item counts as 3 ounces worth of meat, at least that is what we were told. So we were to get 36 ounces of meat with this combination. We also could have opted to get four meals with three items each and it would have yielded the exact same amount of meat.  What the waitress did not tell us is that she would be charging us \"Sharing charges\" for each person that did not receive a full meal. We told her that we did not all need soup and salad and she said that she could waive the sharing fees because of that. But when the check came, there were two sharing fees on it. I asked about this fee, and she explained the reason that they had to put them on there, but we did not all receive our soup and salad. After a little bit of arguing back-and-forth, the waitress said that she would take off one more sharing fee but would still charge for one sharing fee. Except, when we got the bill, it had all of the sharing fees on it anyways. We paid our bill and got the heck out of here! I don't think that I will be back, at least not anytime soon!",

And yes, while they do offer both, the concept is a bit deceiving seeing as how you cannot enjoy both options simultaneously. There is a separate side for each option. You have to choose what side you want which was a huge disappointment to my group and I. Some of us wanted hibachi, some of us wanted AYCE sushi and some of us wanted both so having to choose was really a bummer. We all decided to go with hibachi because at least with that option you can order sushi as well, the all you can eat is just not available there. I sort of understand their reasoning for it being separated but that doesn't change the fact that it's misleading. If you market yourself as a hibachi and AYCE sushi place, we should be able to take part in both. That was our sole reason for deciding on this place. Aside from that, the food was pretty decent, ambience was nice and prices were great. You get a lot of food for what they charge. Just be aware that both options are not available so you and your group must be all be decided on the same cuisine you want.",

And the rice was delicious! It's even better than our usual place. I got the filet and shrimp. John cooked my medium rare filet perfectly. He also made us a special sauce that was amazing! On top of that, John had us try a different way he cooked the chicken with the yum yum sauce and I can't wait to order that next.  The food was amazing but the service was even better. John was hilarious and made it a point to actually talk to us and tell us stories. We were in a group with another family and by the end of the dinner, we were all talking like we had all gone to dinner together. And that was because of John. While we sat there talking after dinner, one of the ladies offered us a green tea shot on the house. That was so nice of them to do especially since the shot was so delicious!

It's not near the strip, but it's a nice location and well worth the drive (or the uber if you don't have a rental).  Got drawn in by the sushi tower which I've seen on IG for over a year. The wait was worth it. Fresh fish, flavorful sauces used.  We had two people in our party that do not eat raw fish and their vegetarian and/or deep fried options were delicious as well. It's hard to find a place that has an extensive list of non-raw rolls.   Interesting note, it's a fusion restaurant so they have hibachi tables as well. Might have to try that part of the restaurant as well.",

My daughter was entertained and our chef was very friendly ( 5 stars for service )  We had reservations and were seated and served right away. The food was good. We tried the chicken, Calamari, steak, and shrimp. Steak was hands down my favorite with a tie between calamari and shrimp. It is a lot of food so come hungry and be prepared to have left overs. For the amount of food you get The prices are not bad!  I took one star away because at the end we had to ask 5 different people for a spoon, stopped getting refills and pretty much started to get ignored. As it got later I think they may have been getting busier but the sooner they bring a spoon, the sooner we can eat our ice cream and leave so it's not really a good excuse. That aside it was an enjoyable dinner in terms of fun and food.",

    "text": "I read several other reviews using the word mediocre to describe the sushi here, I would have to agree. Came here today, both my friend and I got AYCE (which is an excellent deal $21/lunch) but, I should have taken more time to read the menu there was almost no rolls without shellfish almost every single roll had shrimp, crab, or eel. This isn't uncommon with sushi restaurants, I'm used to it... and every single place I've been to is always happy to substitute or leave out shellfish, except here. I ordered a few different rolls but nothing tasted that great. Most of their rolls on the all you can eat are deep fried or baked and I don't usually go for those types of rolls but I had very little to choose from seeing as of how all the shrimp rolls where out of question. I wanted to add lemon to a couple rolls (again never had an issue with this anywhere before)....here, they just sliced up big chunks of lemon and brought it out instead of adding it to the roll? Why? Seemed lazy to me. They also don't have tamari here, so if you're gluten free bring your own soy sauce? The best thing I ate was the veggie salad roll actually.  Our waitress was nice but a little bit slow to bring napkins or notice when we needed something but she was very friendly. Our table got really over crowded with dishes and I accidentally spilled the sake trying to reach around, I don't think they noticed.  So, if you prefer fresh rolls this isn't going to be your favorite place. If I ever go back I will just be sure not to order AYCE and hopefully not be too hungry and then I can stick with a poke and sake.",

For the price, I can say hands down that this is one of my favorite sushi places to go splurge. You can easily get what more than what you paid for, as long as you pace yourself and order smartly.  They have a variety of awesome rolls and nigiri that will definitely fill you up by the end of the night. I like that they had options with or without rice in the rolls and different options like soy paper. And if you aren't in the mood for sushi, they also have the Hibachi grill.  This place is perfect for people who don't like sushi as well, since they have a lot of non-sushi options on the menu. I think this is one of the best places that I have eaten in Vegas so far, which says a lot. Many sushi places that offer AYCE tend to be sub-par in the quality of fish, but this one I can say delivers quality at a great price.",

I mean, with such an expansive ayce lunch menu, I had some pretty high hopes of finding at least one item worth yelping. Alas, the sushi, as well as the hot food, was pretty much meh.  meh, meh, meh, meh.  meh.   The sushi: Ordered the Big Easy and Something Wrong.  Both rolls were equally unimpressive and possibly bordered on downright disappointing.  What got me was the flavor profile of the fish for each roll was completely drowned out in a sea of whatever special sauce they were using to dress it up.  The nigiri was two uneven pieces of mangled fish (to which I totally regret not taking a couple pics for proof) and tasted almost as bad as it looked.  Now I know ayce sushi may not be premium grade fish but at least make it look presentable.  jeez Jjanga, can't you folks try to pretend you know what you're doing?   #hackmyfoodwhydontcha  The hot food:  just don't.  Next time, I maybe leaning more towards quality instead of quantity.  But it is Vegas . . . and they are known for their buffets . . . so that's gonna be a big maybe that borders probably not.  And at this rate, I believe scientists will finally have a picture of the Higgs Boson particle before I find my ultimate AYCE sushi spot in Vegas. And they've been looking for awhile!",

We ended up coming a little bit early, between 4:30 - 5:00 P.M, so we didn't get a chance to do the hibachi, but we ordered off the happy hour menu.  Tons of selections at this restaurant during their Happy Hour. My boyfriend and I picked out a few selection, their Bulgogi, Miso Beef, Vegetable Tempura, their sushi tower, and fried green beans. All of the food was amazing! I didn't try their sushi tower, but I had everything else. The bulgogi meat was scrumptious. The flavor of the meat was out of this world. The Miso Beef was not over-cooked and the Miso was just slightly added to the meat. The vegetable tempura was fried, and a good change once in awhile to vegetables.  The location is off of the 215/Sunset area with a shared private parking. The ambiance in the restaurant is somewhat casual, but can be a great date night spot! I would highly recommend this place!",

Service, in my opinion, has improved tremendously from years past, and it showed on this trip! If I'm not mistaken, a woman, I believe her name was Susan, was constantly checking in with her staff, making sure that they were all on the same page. As a former food-service professional, these little details make a great difference, even if the customer is oblivious to it.   Everyone from the hostesses, to the servers, to even the table bussers, constantly checked in with my good friend and I to see if everything was okay, or if we wanted to order more food. Typically, you don't see table bussers checking in on customers, however, this was a noticeable difference from previous dining experiences here! Yes, they were busy, and yes, you could tell staff was tired...they STILL provided exceptional service, despite all of this  I commend the front of house and back of house workers on a great job well done! We'll definitely be returning for no good reason at all...this is just our go to spot!",

I'm industry so I handed over my credit card too ashamed to call anyone out. Not sure whom to talk to, as we have had 4 different waiters. Super disappointing.",

The food was delicious, but I have to dock them one star for not being able to serve alcohol for whatever reason.   How can you sushi with no sake? :(   Either way we still chowed down on some AYCE sushi. My favorite items were the garlic tuna nigiri, yuzu yellowtail nigiri, playboy special roll and the baked mussels. Out of everything I tasted it was all pretty tasty and came out super quickly. I was kinda disappointed to hear they didn't offer half rolls either which limited my stomach space for trying more of a variety. The options of rolls, apps and desserts was quite plentiful. There's definitely something there for everyone to enjoy.   None the less this was still a good dining experience. I'd like to come back again to try the hibachi dinners.",

    "text": "WOW, WOW, WOW! BEST SUSHI. PERIOD! How to emphasize how amaaaaazing this place is? So it's my first time in Las Vegas with my boyfriend, and we wanted to check out this place because I had read it was the #1 sushi restaurant in all of Las Vegas. Boy, it did NOT disappoint and it only EXCEEDED expectations with every bite. Yum!  Our waiter, Alex, took very good care of us and was very kind and welcoming. He recommended we try the monkey burrito and that first bite was literal heaven. The fresh taste and mix of textures was delicious! And I'm a sucker for anything with crab, so it was definitely one of my favorites.  We took advantage of the all-you-can-eat lunch menu (it's available 11:30 am-3:30 pm for $20.95 per person and it's honestly one heck of a deal! So much bang for your buck) and ended up getting an appetizer (the Bulgogi was fire!!!!), 6 different rolls, a burrito, AND Korean ice cream sandwich. That's incredible! And the portion sizes are just perfect to allow for you to try different things without getting overly stuffed, and I have quite an appetite so this place met my foodie needs. Bold flavor, mix of different tastes, so perfectly put together each time- best experience in Vegas yet! Can't wait to come back! The rolls we got (which were all highly delicious and worth a try) were: XXX (My all-time favorite), screaming honey, playboy, kiss me, dancing eel, and sexy time. Try EVERYTHING and anything!   The Korean ice cream sandwich was extremely pleasant and a light dish, but highly satisfying. The wafer it comes in was delicious and I loved the mix of vanilla ice cream and red bean. I will definitely be back!",

My sister and I came in and there was only one other person dining. We had no idea what we wanted so just randomly picked rolls with names that appealed to us.  Everything was just an okay type of good. I've had sushi with eel sauce and once you have sushi with eel sauce, you cannot go back.  Well I noticed something when our rolls started to come in, they all had just about the same presentation and the same ingredients. Therefore, three of my different plates of rolls tasted pretty much the same and was on the dry side :-(  When we ordered dessert, the server tells us that they ran out of green tea ice cream so the only ice cream they did have was chocolate. Man, I'm disappointed to even be recommended chocolate ice cream.  Our experience at this location was underwhelming. I might give it another try soon but that soon could be delayed by other AYCE establishments.",

I had order Togo and had a few of the items After I made the order it said it would be 45-55 minutes? That seems very long ??usually I can usually get stuff in around 30 minutes to 40 minutes tops for Togos  But I thought they might be busy so I arrived in at about 40 minutes They looked a little busy I went up to hostess and picked up my order it was in 4 boxes I kid you not it felt like there was nothing in the boxes it was extremely light ? I drove home in 5 minutes and started with the chicken satays  it was barely warm and was super dry , flavor was average at best The beef skewers were ice  cold and once again very dry ? I then had the California roll they were just average nothing special I wasn't expecting anything special on this one cause it's pretty boring roll  the bulgowas probably the best thing but it was ok Looks way better on the website ? I don't know if it's me or just didn't have the greatest experiences ? I doubt if I'll ever be back ?",

    "text": "I have a love hate relationship with AYCE sushi. I typically don't like these locations because I feel the quality of the fish usually suffers. What brought me to Jjanga first was the sushi burgers. I order mine tempura style take off one bun and eat it open faced with jalapenos on top. Do what I do, it's delicious.  On our 4th visit we decided to do the AYCE option for lunch at $20 pp. This time we were with our newborn son with stroller in tow the hostess/manager wanted to seat us directly in the aisle, when we asked for another table she said those are for larger parties. We eventually asked to be seated at a booth and to have the outside chairs removed so we we could put the stroller on that side of the table while I sat on the end. The restaurant is big but the sushi area is quite small, if they allowed us to sit at a hibachi table that may free up some space. Anyway I digress the rolls were ok, some of the rolls are the same as my favorite sushi place and even though it was the same ingredients theirs didn't quite stack up but it was good enough to keep us coming back as it's close to our new home.  3 stars for the sushi and an extra star for the burger.",

They split the restaurant in a sushi side and a hibachi side, which leaves the sushi side kind of cramped. My aunt asked to be moved because she felt uncomfortable, but they told us no despite the fact the table she wanted was the original one they were going to give us. They didn't give it to us because we decreased our party from 8 to 6. The service was very inattentive. It was really hard to order when we were ready.   The one reason I loved the original location was because they had a solid sushi to rice ratio on their nigiri. But they load the nigiri here with so much rice, which is a huge turn off. I would honestly drive a little extra to visit their other location.",

The fish quality is hit (as good as it can be for AYCE) or miss. The waitresses are pretty nice, the guys at the bar aren't the easiest to talk to but are still pretty solid service wise. I didn't have a single dish here that was great, but most were at least okay. I liked the little fish salads, but limiting to one order for such small dishes is kind of absurd. AYCE in general has gone way downhill, so I think three stars makes this one of the more appetizing AYCE spots in town.",

I had already drank about a quarter of it  so it made me sick  to my stomach so we asked for a refill on our hot water server pick up both cups with one hand I'm like that is weird when he returns 15 sec later he sets the same cups on the table by touching what seemed like every inch of the rim where you would put your mouth . Like come on dude  foodborne illness is a real thing  . It makes you wonder how clean the whole place truly is . I mean the sushi places are always on like Dirty Dining .

I love that this location is close by other businesses and not too far from the park.  After reviewing the menu, We decided on eating Acyer for Sushi, and side dishes for the Lil  picky eater!  Love that they have an  All You Can Eat option- which included other items   (everything written in black) on the menu- ACYER, it's a bit pricey $20.95 for Lunch and $29.95 for dinner. I guess if you can eat a ton, than you can get your money's worth. I was definitely not impressed with the food. But I think more disappointed in the service. Today they weren't even packed, but the service we were rendered, made it reflect as if it was a full house. They hardly came to check on our table, and when they did they took forever to bring out our food (as if was a method of us to getting full because our food had time to settle)... The server was terrible:  Ex. I ordered a water with no lemon because of my kiddo, and I am still currently waiting for that water. The lady who brought out our food mumbled and walked away quickly- so  we have no idea, who ordered what!  I think the most disturbing and upsetting thing for my experience personally- is the fact that they charged a mandatory %20 service charge fo a table of 3 adults and 5 children?  I would have gladly tipped 20% or more if the service was spectacular.  But unfortunately it was no where that required percentage.  I have never been to any establishment that would do this, considering how the server didn't even attend to the 5 kids- getting drinks is requirement, -taking an order is an requirement, -serving the food is requirement.  Being ignored most of the experience, definitely not worth 3 adults each, tipping 20% We should of known when we first arrived that the service was going to be terrible, it took more than 15mins to be seated in a non busy Time. The sad part the lady who was there before us got seated after us with her party of 2adults and 2 babies!   I can't help but think because they were featured in Thrillst, they think they're establishment is special. Sorry the sushi burgers might be a thing, but not my thing!  Definitely not coming back to a restaurant that is expensive (overpriced), terrible service, and a mandatory tip. Back in my day tips were optional and not forced at the highest percentage. I also want to know who the hell charges $2.00 for a tiny bowl of rice, and $5.00 for a small Bulgogi plate that comes with no rice! I can't get pass how the prices were, I just can't see myself coming back for more poor service and over priced items.",

They have a great selection but service and wait times were well below average given there were only a few other tables of 2 present during dinner.   The two stars are for their variety and flavor. A few of their special rolls were delicious but almost every item was poorly constructed. It almost seemed like sushi rice wasn't used. All rolls and Nigiri fell apart as soon as they were lifted off the plate.   I know that all new businesses go through their growing pains so I'm hoping quality will be addressed. I may try them out again in a few months with hopes of improvement",

They also have really good happy hour specials on wine! Their service was on point, super friendly people that work here! I would definitely recommend this place, cool atmosphere great food and good music. Ask for Alex! He's the best!!!",

I always get the Miso soup cause it delicious. I love the Tako (octopus) it's always super fresh.   The staff is super friendly. Sit with Koo Koo at the sushi bar with Sponge there too. Ellen will host the restaurant and treat like you're family.",

We didn't do the habachi, but it looked fun and yummy with good prices so we will definitely try it another time.  The restaurant is a lot nicer than the other location. The interior is modern and it was in a giant room with a lot of young, fun people so the mood was better. It appeared they have the same rolls as the other location which you can't beat. I thought the service was better here and a server was always asking us for additional orders, but unlike the other location they would stay and talk to you and joke around with you. I also had other drinks besides sake at this location. I only ever drank sake or beer at the other location so I am not sure if they offer the same cocktails, but I absolutely loved my gummy bear martini! It tasted just like a gummy bear and even had a couple in there. I am really happy that we have a JJanga around the corner from our house. We will be a frequent customer for sure!",

Not only did the server Antonio remember my husband and I from our last visit, he remembered what we requested. Over a month later (what?!) I sincerely hope management here recognizes him. He is actually what brought us back and the reason for our highly rated review.  My husband loves the red rock roll.   The Japanese Lasagna is ok, I feel like it could be baked a little more.  They close pretty early though, our friends made it at 1058 and when their server came at 1102 they were told they couldn't order all you can eat after 11. :(",

So after taking the time to get off my butt and check it out, I was extremely happy to find out all the things I loved about the first location translated here 10 fold.   The service is on point with the host and hostesses taking the time to explain things on the menu as well as giving you a timely heads up if something isn't quite right with your order.   The price is the same (which is really good for what you get at dinner or lunch) and the quality of the food is still top notch.  While the plates aren't as stackable (a minor complaint (;), I will totally be making a return trip here since it's so on point and so close.   Tl;dr -- Great service, food, and price. Sushi places can be a dime in a dozen but this one is a place you should check out.",

Their service is pretty good too. I love this place and bring friends there all the time but they do need to work on their consistency. Of course the same chef can't work day to night every day but there shouldn't be a noticeable difference between different chefs' dishes. And their service can be a little inconsistent as well; most servers are great but they do have one or two that seem to always be in a bad mood.  Update --- food seems to be more consistent now and customer service has been better :)",

    "text": "Wow what a great experience from the second we walked in the door. The owner greeted us with open arms and led us with jokes and a smile into the sushi side of the restaurant (the other side is teppan) which was cleverly partitioned from its neighbor and so well decorated. It even had cool tongue-in-cheek giant photos of the sushi chefs with their nicknames. So fun!  We sit down at the table and opt for the all you can eat option (as we, especially for two small girls, can notoriously put away some food haha). I let my friend order as she is a pro and as usual, she did not disappoint.   I will let my photos guide the experience for the most part, but my favorites were the uni, halibut, sweet shrimp, some more uni, steak bites, the YUZU YELLOWTAIL (amazing!!), beef tataki, BAKED GREEN MUSSELS, even more uni, and the tobiko...   Okay i had a lot of favorites, but everything wad amazing and fresh and presented in a beautifully simple way. On top of that we had raw fresh wasabi (a first for me and 100% to die for), udon, garlic gingko nuts (couldn't stop eating it), tempura shrimp, gyoza, sake, and of course, green tea ice cream.   I left at the end of it all in a blissful state of a euphoric ethereal food coma crossed with that feeling where you way up from an amazing vivid dream and for a second you don't recognize reality, know what time it is, and cant for the life of you figure out exactly where you are... And then it passes and you realize this is reality, you are you, and you are in your bedroom. And for the rest of the day you cant help but shake that feeling like some part of you is still there in that dream... You know what I mean?   What i am trying to say is this: the place was awesome, the food was delicious, and for the rest of the day my reality was pleasantly infused with with the smell of the sea and a yearning for yuzu yellowtail. :)  Check it out. You will love it.",

    "text": "- This place is ALWAYS busy.  - BUT, the wait time is usually only 15-20 minutes, & their timing has been accurate every time I've come in.  - You have to write your name / # in your party / & whether you're going to have Sushi or Hibachi on a clipboard located on the host counter. I always usually go for their AYCE sushi, so I can't really speak for their Hibachi dining.  - They have a good selection of sushi - As well as a variety of other dishes, such as Sushi Burritos, Skewers & Hot Stone Plates, & their specials! (ALL part of the AYCE) - Good selection of ice cream / mochi AND they give you a good amount/scoop too, some AYCE literally give you the tiniest cup of ice cream. (Also part of the AYCE) their green tea & red bean are my fav!  - Service is great. Servers/bussers are constantly making sure you're okay, refilling your water, clearing your table of empty plates, and are attentive. Basically, they're actually doing their jobs, unlike some other AYCE restaurants.  - Overall experience has always been good. Will definitely continue to come back. Have not had one bad experience thus far, and I've been back here quite a few times.",

After the way we were treated here, no thanks. If you eat here all the time like we did, sometimes twice in one week, they tend to laugh at you. You would think they would want the business. Not no more I'll give my money to people who appreciate it.",

    "text": "Had lunch here at 1:00 and it wasn't busy so was seated right away. The hostess was very friendly and smiled. The ambience and decor was nice , bright, and clean.  There are plenty of seating options from regular tables, a bar , sushi bar and hibachi bar.   It was my first time having sushi and my girlfriends and I opted for the AYCE for 21 bucks. We had 3 apps which included the edamame, shrimp tempura, and pot stickers. The tempura had a nice, light yet crunchy batter. Satisfying 2 bites. Next time I think I would skip the apps and just stick with the sushi but it's nice to have choices. The menu had a wide variety of choices, including non spicy items. I like spicy but if you are dining with friends who don't it is a great option   Onto to the sushi. My friends ordered the spider wrap, a dragon roll and the crunch wrap. I've never tried eel before bit have to say the dragon roll was one of my favorites. Nice flavors and I love the little bit of crunch the cucumber added. The crab in the spider was a wee bit fishy for me but I am not a big seafood eater. We ordered a few more items including the three way which had cream cheese, tuna, with a crunchy tempura topping. Delish! Once I had tried a few things I felt confident enough to order and I went with sexy times.  It had crunchy rice on the bottom topped by tuna, jalapeno, sriracha sauce and had drizzled spicy mayo and eel sauce on the plate. This was my numero uno. Loved the textures and flavor explosions.   The service was excellent. I didn't catch the gal's name at the sushi bar but she was very patient with me and kept asking if we wanted to order anything else.   All in all a terrific experience popping my sushi cherry. Would go back in a heartbeat.",

We even a few of the sushi chef offer some free samples of their creations.  They were very good. They don't offer Bento box dinners only the Teppanyaki or Sushi bar.  I wasn't sure if I could order teppanyaki without having to seat at the grill.  I don't really care for that area.  But otherwise the sushi choices were good.  We'll come back and try some of the other rolls.",

In the past three or four visits, the quality of the fish, and the way the rolls/rice/other dishes are put together has been going steadily downhill. Tonight was the worst...and the last time we'll go for sure: we've been home two hours and we're both already feeling sick. The nigiri was all fishy tasting...definitely not very fresh. The rice in the rolls and the nigiri was literally falling apart as soon as we picked it up. The baked rolls were burnt. The cucumber wasn't fresh at all. The best thing on the table tonight out of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, super white tuna, and halibut), appetizers, and various special rolls, was the ginger. At least that tasted fresh. Such a shame, as this was one of our favorites.",

I guess some people just like all you can eat because this food was not impressive at all. The food was exactly what you would expect if you went to an all you can eat sushi place it was $25.99 for all you can eat they had a wide selection of sushi rolls.... you could get fried rice, sashimi, amongst other things but nothing has flavor everything is very bland except for the fried rice. Only tried the all you can eat sushi!!!! Teppanyaki is available too. Good place to hang out with a group of people. Wont be back.",

They could've been experiencing a bad day; however, my experience will cause me to never come back. My coworkers and I got the dine-in deal of 1 classic roll, 1 signature roll, an appetizer, soup, and salad for $12.95. It was a lot of food for the price but the food was just ok and the service was bad.  The soup and salad came out right away. Then there was a very awkward 30 minute break before anyone came back and gave us the additional food. Then the rolls started coming out before the appetizers and two people were given all three items at once while two were given 2/3 items and I was only given 1. We had to wait another 10+ minutes for the rest to come out. When the woman dropped off my signature roll, I had to pull her really long hair out of my roll which just solidified me never going back.  Could they have just experienced a terrible day? Yes, but the restaurant wasn't busy and the sushi was prepared horribly (each piece fell apart when you barely touched it with a chopstick). The taste was fine, but I will continue going to the sushi place that is in the plaza next to Jjanga.",

This was a bummer because I wanted AYCE and my boyfriend wanted hibachi so I was forced to order my sushi a la carte.  2.) they charge extra to share one hibachi order, I guess cleaning 1 extra plate is $5-$6  3.) hibachi is 2+ main items, no option to do 1 main item unless you have a child under 12. This is unfortunate to those of us adults who don't prefer hefty portions.  After that, the hibachi flavors were WONDERFUL, well worth the annoyance just to get to this point. Service was on point as well. Just be prepared before you go or the restrictions may leave a sour taste about the restaurant.",

    "text": "Always been fan of Jjanga since visited the original location on Decatur. I feel like the quality of the fish is top notch with other top AYCE sushi spots! Unlike the original at this location they also offer Teppanyaki Hibachi style. Not really fan of the whole Hibachi show but while sitting with friends for AYCE. We were able to watch some of the show and seems like the customers at the tables were having good time. Maybe next time have the urge might check other half of the restaurant. One side have the Hibachi and the other side have traditional restaurant style for AYCE or a la carte style sushi. One of the other differences is this place is lot bigger and lot more modern. The sushi bar is decent size and if ever want get Jjanga on solo more then enough room plus have nice wide screen televisions above. The service was awesome! They were on top of all of our orders every round and never empty glass in front of us.   Something I enjoy looking at the menu. Just the creative names they have for some of there sushi rolls. Not that the rolls itself is totally different then other rolls find at other sushi spots. I like the fact they have fun with different names and thinking outside the box. I enjoy the spicy roll section there really not bad one to choose from. Best part about have another Jjanga is never have enough of good thing in life. Quality sushi seems like lost art in Vegas with the abundance of AYCE sushi. Jjanga is one that deserve five star and would put it right up there with any other five star sushi spot in Vegas.  Jjanga by far coolest sushi chef and owner. The guy truly cares about each customer having great experience and just good guy.",

Empty when we arrived, we were seated and ordered drinks and apps.  It would be the last time we would see our server until we wanted to leave. Waited...waited...waited.  The place slowly started to get busy. Chef showed up and began cooking as 2 of 3 apps showed up. Third app was MIA.  Food was average at best, not nearly as good as last times. What the hell is the deal with serving up spaghetti first??? Drinks were sitting on the bar for over 10 minutes when Chef noticed and had them brought over.  Meal ended and we didn't see our server for 15 minutes. Guest finally asked host for check. Very embarrassing to me.",

Not goops of heavy thick sauces like at other ayce places.     The portions are perfectly small for sampling lots of dishes.  Pumpkin soup is a nice change from miso.  The ginkgo nuts are buttery, garlicky delicious.  And I recently tried the screaming honey which was a lightly fried spicy salmon roll with no rice... The crispy thin seaweed melted in my mouth!  The service is friendly and they regularly check back.   This is the only place I've been to with female sushi chefs as well...   I like the atmosphere.  A large room for people watching, but music and acoustics allow for privacy at your table.",

In the mean time, every server came up and asked if we needed anything and we repeatedly said the exact same rolls. It was extremely disappointing. The first time we came, it was extremely busy, but the food was good, as was the service. Tonight, the restaurant is practically empty and it was a terrible experience.",

Got AYCE, and I swear to god they only took my order ONCE and never came back. I asked for the check and it came 20 mins later. Oh and I had asked our server, some young Asian chick with long black hair in a ponytail wearing high knee socks, if they had fresh wasabi and she said \"no just regular\" but when I finished eating I saw on the menu that they did in fact had fresh wasabi. I tried calling her over to my table countless times and she would even give me eye contact but never came. The restaurant was pretty dead. Pls train your employees better and hire ppl who are willing to learn your menus. I'd rather get sushi at 711. I recommend OYSHI!! Better selection of sushi and way better service.",

They have great service and a wide array of choices to order from. I've been coming here now for about two years and that won't stop for as long as I'm here. I have been to other sushi restaurants and always find them lacking in freshness or highly over priced but as for here the \"all you can eat\" price for lunch and dinner is great. I highly recommend coming here.   Another thing I love that they serve is fresh wasabi if you ask for it, other places don't usually but they do and believe if you like it try the fresh one it's way better.",

    "text": "JJanga used to be really awesome. The quality, service, and the overall feel was always great. However, the past 3 times I have been here have proved that otherwise.   I bring a lot of business whenever I come here. I always bring a party of 8+ on a frequent basis due to me bringing friends from out of town or workmates to enjoy good sushi. However, the past few times they would either ignore us or give me backlash on why they can't do certain things.   I ordered salmon belly but won't bring it out. When 30 minutes pass and I ask about the order you tell me that it's too big of an order and that they need to save some for other people... Uh hello? We have a party of 10... I asked for 10 orders. Are you telling me you guys are cheaping out and not wanting to bring an order for per person to the table? Whatever, I let that one pass.   What I can't let pass is when you start yelling in Korean about how much belly is left to your chefs. You hesitated in telling me what they said, probably because you figured out I also speak Korean, don't try to be shady. On top of that you tell us that our free AYCE card can't be applied until the next visit... Uh I only had 2 more spaces left with a party of 10. How does that make sense? Holy crap, us Koreans are cheap, buts that just straight dookie.   Last time I came, service was non existent. I get it when your busy service will get slow, but I came in during late lunch and there was only 2 other tables... I had to wave my bill for 5 minutes at the girls face for her to come and get it, only because I had to wait 15 minutes. Do you not want to get paid? Because if that's the case I'll consider it free sushi and walk out next time.",

I usually try to time it right and I've gotten seated as soon as I walked in to waiting about 20 mins. Once I made the mistake of coming here late at night and it was super crowded had to wait about an hour.   Service has always been great whenever I go. The waiters and waitress never take too long with my long list of orders. The sushi is very good, may not be fresh but it isn't dry like some other places. Tried their sushi burgers too and they are delicious! The burgers are pretty large and great for the price you pay.  I'm not sure what brand it is but they also have really good ice cream. I don't expect much with it being a ayce sushi but their ice cream bomb.",

They even had a treasure box of kid toys that she could choose from!   Sushi wise it was good but not the best. Of course it's AYCE so you can't expect the best quality but the quality was ok. It wasn't the freshest but it wasn't the worst. There's a huge variety of rolls and appetizers and they were pretty quick at getting out our orders. The rice to fish ratio was standard and the rolls weren't over sauced.   Overall, I would come back for the convenience factor and the service. It's not going to be the best sushi ever but it is fairly good. They have teppanyaki as well if you rather not have raw fish. It's a fairly big place so if there's ever a wait I don't see it being extremely long.",

Plus, you get a free dessert if you write a review, so it's hard to argue with that.  Don't expect anything new and exciting, but expect a slightly better version of Benihana at a slightly better price.",

The food was not only fresh and delicious, but also cost friendly.  I had the new Jjanga burger on my mind so that was first on my list.  The spicy tuna was magnificent.  Offset by the smooth taste of the eel sauce and the panko crusted rice bun it was just amazing.  A little hard to eat as so much was loaded in between these buns but it made it an adventure.  When I ordered I asked what size the burger was thinking if it was a slider size I may as well get a sushi bulgogi burrito to accompany it.  The burger was much bigger than described and when the food came out I knew a challenge lay ahead.  Needless to say since both were so delicious I managed to finish them off.  Although this place is a short drive from the main strip it is well worth the trip.",

If you like a crusted bun then definitely go with the panko crusted rice bun! That's the option I went with and it was a perfect blend of crunchy mixed in with a loaded amount of seafood. Definitely more seafood from the burger than if you bought a sushi roll by itself!  Come check this place out for the burger or the all you can eat sushi!!!",

I love the quality and variety of sushi offered at such a great price considering... creative rolls, no rice rolls and options, sushi burritos, salads and all of the Japanese sides. All of the sauces are amazing, yet jus the forewarned they're heavily sauced so if watching your 'macros' simply request light sauce or no mayo-based sauce ie yum yum.. That being said, this is the second time we have dined here with sub-par Service. Half of our table was AYCE and the other half simple ala carte ordering. Ordering was kept simple as a courteous to waitress, yet as the meal progressed we were pretty much forgotten on several occasions, with the waitress no where to be found even after sushi rolls were left sitting, ready at the sushi bar. Even after Kindly requesting more prompt service and attention, the waitress insisted that anyone could take care of us... I wish I could say the restaurant was overly busy or give some other excuse for such lack of service and indifferent answer. It could be a training issue, not really sure. We even tipped 20% over the 20% included gratuity not paying much attention to the bill. No sure if I can recommend this location or bring friends or family to this location. A little embarrassing to say the least and too many options available in this town!!",

They have the hibachi tables and chefs in the front and the sushi bar and seating on the side. This isn't your average sushi place where you are all squished in one room. It's very spacey and gives your more privacy. We have followed Jjanga to each of his restaurants and I plan on continuing that tradition until the end of time. The sushi is fresh, and they accomodate to your tastes. My first time doing the hibachi will be on my birthday so I can't wait! Clean, friendly staff, great food!",

    "text": "I finally tried Jjanga for a late dinner the first time I went here.  I had all you can eat sushi.  I tried their bacon roll and another roll that was spicy.  I love bacon! So I ended up liking their bacon sushi roll a lot.  I also tried their sweet fried tofu which was super delicious as well! I wish I had more now that I'm thinking of it.  We had an enjoyable experience.  Our waitress was very friendly and knew a lot about the menu when I had questions about the sushi.  She checked up on us and was very hospitable.  The atmosphere is great, it's spacious and modern.  The seats are comfortable and people have a lot of room on their table for food.  I had hot green tea as well, which has unlimited free refills.  I also tried the green tea ice cream, which was really good too.  At the end of our dinner, the lady that rung me up gave me a punch card and put two stamps because one of the waiters accidentally messed up on our bills and gave us a different table's bill.  They apologized and were friendly about it.    The second time I came here I tried hibachi. I loved their hibachi! It's probably so far...my favorite place to go to...in all of Vegas.  Our cook was lively, friendly, and funny.  He did a lot of tricks and pretty much had a whole skit. I had scallops, fried rice, vegetables, spaghetti, chicken, and shrimp.  Their sauces were yummy! I enjoyed two out of the three.  It was plenty of food, but definitely worth it because I had some left to take home. I would go here again for hibachi or all you can eat sushi.",

They sat us by the sushi bar. The table and chairs are made of food. The seats have no cushion. So after a few minutes of sitting down your butt starts  to hurt. Very uncomfortable. The chairs are dark and light color. The dark color is because they are dirty. There was a guy cleaning the backs of the benches while people were eating at surrounding tables. Cant they clean after hours? Not very pleasant to know. What else is dirty in this place. We got all you can eat. The fish behind  the sushi bar in the glass case. The more I looked at it. It didn't look to fresh. There was some bottle of medicine on top of the sushi bar, along with a pill bottle on the back wall in plain sight. There were to wood decor boats on top of the sushi bar. They were full of dust. While we were eating the sushi, it tasted pretty good. But I should say they put tons of rice and hardly any sushi. Once we left my wife and I both statutes to get stomach pains. Almost like as if they use msg or something. I usually eat a lot more sushi when we go to other all you can eat sushi places. So maybe they do use msg or something. I will never go here again. Take in note the place looks nice when you first go in. And we excited to eat here. I wasn't going to right a review. And I usually don't right a review like this. But when I get a stomach ache after I eat something isn't right with the food. That's why I did a review like this.",

Walked in during lunch time with literally only 5 tables in use so not busy at all. Hostess is on the phone and in front of her is some disgruntled customer. Totally understandable that she's dealing with something. What I have a problem with is her back is to us and when she finally turns around she doesn't even bother to acknowledge that us and the other people have gathered waiting to be seated. This goes on for more than 20 minutes. The hostess doesn't signal for help from other staff nor does anyone else come to seat the customers. I was ready to bounce but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. We were finally seated and everyone else was nice and attentive. We both did AYCE sushi and honestly it was unmemorable. The rolls were all very similar and nothing really stood out. A lot of items were omitted from the AYCE and whats left are just generic choices. We drove 25 minutes to try this place and it was not worth the drive.",

I came to try their sushi burger, but instead ended up staying for the AYCE. One difference here is that they are primarily Korean so in addition to the sushi, they also feature many Korean dishes like KFC, pumpkin soup, and bulgogi, amongst others. Their sushi is great, but the biggest downside of Jjanga is their ratio of rice. In fact, if you're doing AYCE, don't even bother getting the sushi burritos, as the one I got was 80% or more of rice.   Rice ratios aside, I did enjoy many of their specials including the salmon belly, uni, oyster (Korean style), and golden scallop. They also have the other half of the restaurant feature hibachi, which I have yet to try. Although Jjanga probably won't be my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant, I would return to try their panko crusted rice bun burgers, which some reasonable at $9.",

    "text": "Really unfortunate how this place has gone down in service and as well as quality of food.    Dining Experience: As soon as we got seated, our waiter left us for a good 10-15 minutes. We didn't even water or any plates on the tables. When we finally got a waiter's attention, the food took about 25-35 minutes to come out. Funny enough, out food that we got weren't even the ones that we had ordered. When we told our waiter, he had no idea what we even ordered and it took another 30 minutes to get our rolls and nigiri out. Eating AYCE, that takes us about most of the time you're allowed to eat there.   Food: I noticed how they change a few things on the menu. One of my favorite things to get here were the baby octopus. They limited it to one per person and it's small :-( and not even half as flavorful as it was before.   Overall: I used to love going to this place. I always raved to my boyfriend that we should finally go together and try it after so long. It was very disappointing. They've really knocked down on the wait for food, quality of food, and so forth. I was expecting so much more from this place due to my past experiences here.",

We only waited about 10 minutes for a table which was surprising. I come here a lot but usually during lunch and sometimes dinner during weekdays and I've never seen it so busy so it was a different experience. I was absolutely shocked at how attentive the staff was!! Our server frequently came by to ask if we needed to order more, our water was filled as soon as it was at it's halfway point, and other staff members inquired if we needed anything throughout dinner. Everyone was so friendly too! Good job and keep it up to whoever is running this restaurant!",

From my recent visit for lunch food arrived real slow but for dinner they were really quick but forgot part of our orders. The quality of fish and rolls also has dropped from what they used to be.

    "text": "If you've seen that viral Facebook video of that sushi burger, then you know you can get it here.  It's very similar to a sushi burrito. The \"patties\" are made of rice. I suggest getting the Panko crust for that extra crunch.  The sushi burger, called Jjanga Burger, consists of spicy tuna, crab meat, and seaweed salad. It's wrapped in a brown paper to help keep its shape. You can get the burger alone for $9 or get the combo for $13. The combo will get you the burger, fries, and a drink. I'm a fries girl, so I ALWAYS go for the combo. My fiance on the other hand says he can pass on the fries  I deducted a star because the first time I had this, my fiance picked it up to go and he was carrying 4 small size clear cups. He said that they don't have any other size cups so they gave him 2 of each to equal a medium size. Wouldn't it be easier to invest in bigger size cups?  Other than that, I've already been back 3 times. I love ordering it to go. I work 5 minutes away and it only takes 15-20 minutes to prep.",

For about 1/2 hour waitress never check back with us and see if we were good or needed anything. I finally call her over and again she told me to wait because she was busy. When she finally came over I told her we did I not receive all of our food. We were missing 3 rolls and 3 dynamite. I reduce my order and just got one sushi roll what my friend wanted. We paid and left. waitress apologized and gave us $15 discount on the next visit. I don't know if I would return.",

They Are so big you can barely take a bit of the whole burger. Every bit was full of flavor. We tried the panko crust it was a little hard to eat I think next time I will definitely try the the white rice buns instead. I'm only giving them a 4 star because of the service. Our waiter forgot to bring drinks and food to our table I had to call him over and remind him 2 different times with no apology for his mistake and no concern that we were about to leave. He didn't even offer to remove it from our bill our think kids didn't get to eat it. That was a little upsetting because the food was worth returning but customer service was iffy.",

Tried to make reservation but they only take it for parties of 4 or more. I went in around 8pm and it took about 20 mins to get seated. I am glad I tried it, because now I know I don't have to return and wait. no mo fomo  We were seated at the bar and the servers must've been confused about who serves that section. We were approached by about 3-4 different servers asking if we wanted a drink or to order appetizer. I guess it is better to be overserved than underserved. Ok, i won't complain about this.  I've easily been to 20-30 different restaurants that serve AYCE sushi and knew exactly what to expect. I didn't expect the freshness or taste of sushi to be the best. Coming in with such low standards already, the taste/quality of sushi was even lower than my subpar expectations. The rice tasted hard and stale, it didn't matter how good the fish was. Here are some of my comments about things I've tried:  APPETIZERS: Screaming orgasm: 0/5 -- do not get this please! it taste like stale beef jerky. Volcano shrimp/green mussel/shrimp tempura: 3/5 Garlic parmesan edamame: 5/5 -- liked this a lot  SUSHI: Salmon skin roll: 3/5 -- not bad, would get again Ono nigiri: 5/5 -- this was the only saving grace of the meal, the rice was bearable because it was drenched in the sauce Salmon/yellowtail/garlic tuna nigiri: 3/5 Surf & Turf roll: 1/5 Koo Koo Special: 2/5 -- the 2 is for the spicy mayo lol Yuzu salmon belly sashimi: 2/5 -- man how do you mess up salmon belly  DESSERT: I'll give them 5/5 for having melona popsicle  Here are some positives: -- attentive servers, nice chefs -- their chococlate ice cream (i am sure it's thrifty or something LOL) -- the edamame -- their teppanyaki smelled good  I should've known that a place that also tries to do teppanyaki cannot have great sushi. I am of the mentality that you can't be good at everything, so just pick one thing (sushi) and killll it. There are a lot of awesome AYCE sushi places in vegas but jjanga is not one of them.",

So I told myself let's check out this spot.   Came here for a LATE DINNER around 1130pm on a Sunday night and it was a slow night and lots of open tables so my party and I got seated right away.   FOOD MENU * So to make things clear their MENU 1st of could be a little confusing cause they have their AYCE MENU choice then they also have a section for HAPPY HOUR and also their ALA CARTE section which some choices are not included in their AYCE MENU CHOICES. (so honestly a little bit confusing)   FOOD SUSHI * Their NIGIRI's was OKAY I would say as for portion wise via fish CUTS on their fish it's so small  it kinda reminded me of some other AYCE sushi joint in vegas. The Quality for the fish was good I would say but I've had better at some AYCE sushi joints in vegas.   *We ordered their OYSTERS Which is just 1 PC order per person in their AYCE menu and for some reason idk if their was a miss communication among the waiter staff and the chef's but damn oysters took hella long to come to us. If I'd recall it probably took about 25/30 mins for our ORDER of oysters and it was only 4pcs as well (SMH) And on another hand I ordered a Sushi roll and the waiters gave me two different rolls so I was confused on what did I actually eat and order. But much props to our two servers they were kool dudes.   Parking * lots of free parking in front of the Resturant   Would I want to come back and eat here again / PROBABLY ahhhhhhh not quite sure.",

We walked into about a 20 minute wait and went to the bar where we had a couple Japanese whiskies. The bartender was nice which gave me a very positive feeling about the place. The two of us ended up sitting at the sushi bar which was pretty cool to see all the action.   Then we started eating a sushi it was a lot of rolls with unique names that were pretty okay. My biggest problem with this place was that the sushi chef didn't listen. he took her orders directly since we're sitting in front of them and I told them no mayonnaise on the one no sauce on a different one because I don't like too much sweet or fat sauce is on them and prefer them plain but he still put them on there.   They also completely forgot to service one of the side dishes, seaweed salad, which I was really looking forward to. Because of the lack of listening in the service from both the server and the sushi chef, plus I didn't end up liking one of the rolls and didn't eat it is why I give it two stars. By the way if it wasn't for the good bartender who is really nice and friendly I probably would have given this place one Star.",

So I had the steak along with lobster and shrimp. Food was very good.",

    "text": "The summary-- nice place with great staff and good food.   What makes it along the best in my opinion,  they have cheese curds!  Sushi and cheese curds- life for this guy originally from Minnesota is now complete.   It's Monday so I am looking for a new place to try.   Today my quest brought me to Jjanga.  After driving out the surface roads into what seems like another city I finally found my destination.  I quickly realized my GPS didn't tell me I could have just taken the 215 to Russell and then turned onto Fort Apache.    Upon entering the plaza I saw a myriad of dining options and of course its headlined by Jjanga.  It's a pleasant entrance and welcoming environment.  There is a fairly long sushi bar staffed by 4 chefs.     They have a fairly large selection on their all you can eat menu.   As usual I declined the appetizer portion of the menu when asked by an attentive server.   I got my usual nigiri order cajun albacore,  garlic tuna,  and yuzu yellowtail.   They came cut very thick which I understand is more traditional than most of ther places I frequent.  They were tasty but the cajun seasoning wasn't really my favorite.     The Korean bbq room was next and definitely was a new favorite of mine.  As I'm savoring this roll,  I'm looking at the front of the menu and browsing the appetizers to find out what they have.  I found much to my amazement they have cheese curds!  I was guessing this couldn't be True but I placed an order for then and also the one time order for the Golden Scallop.    While I'm waiting I try the Burning Your Ass Roll.   It was good.   Not that spicy but good.   I also tried the Coco Shrimp Roll.   It was fairly amazing with the sweet coconut flavor permeating throughout the roll.     Then it comes.   The cheese curds.   Yes there are cheese curds at a sushi place!   It is an order of about 6 and they look like a small version of some you could get at a bar in Minnesota.  They were amazing!   The Golden Scallop also was amazing it fell apart in my mouth, every bite was delicious.     I also tried the Kiss of Fire roll which was good and came with a nice kick.  The last of my rolls was the XXX Roll which was a great ending to a great dinner.   And yes I had to have one more order of cheese curds.     All in all Jjanga was with the trip and I encourage anyone living nearby to give it a try.      It's a little more than some places but only by a couple of bucks.  If you're from the midwest and like sushi and cheese curds Jjanga is definitely worth the visit.  A lot of the rolls you can find elsewhere,  cheese curds you can find elsewhere but the combination plus the great staff and the tastefully decorated environment make me a fan of Jjanga.",

It was a good decision :) Located about 20 min (by car) off the Vegas strip in a strip-mall , Jjanga offers ample seating inside and a cute patio outside. We were there on a weekday afternoon so it was pretty dead, but we were greeted by a friendly host.  We quickly perused their extensive menu as we knew exactly what we were looking for. I ordered the Unagi Burger while my friend had the Sushi Trio, and we also shared the Sushi Tower. The food was yummm and very filling. I did think my burger had a whole lot of rice and not as much other stuff but it still tasted good.  Overall a good experience and would consider going back whenever back in the area.",

If it weren't for our awesome server Krystal, I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed this place as much as I did.  We didn't do All You Can Eat, we just ordered by the roll 4 rolls: California, jackpot, TNT, and Mexican. All of them were mediocre. Even the California roll was poorly done, however it was only $4, so it makes sense as to why the avocado was browning already inside the roll. Also, if you're an avid mochi lover (like myself) they definitely don't give you enough mochi for the price that you pay.   Overall, I can't say I'll be back again, unless I have another get together there. I have definitely been fo much better sushi joints in town (Sushi Loca or Yama Sushi) check those ones out.",

A little disappointed that there are limited sashimi specials on AYCE menu.  Service was attentive.  Food sometimes is a little slow or gets backed up on busy days/times.  I like that my little ones aren't charged especially since they don't really eat much if anything sometimes.  I believe under 3 is free.  Pretty loud in the restaurant, which is good for my kids so no one can hear them crying or throwing a tantrum haha!",

They take away a lot of the normal AYCE choices from the lunch menu and move them to the dinner menu pushing to pay the extra $5. And then on top of that they're best know for their sushi specialties.... burritos, hamburgers, cupcakes etc.  not my cup of tea. I'm a nigiri girl and I'll put em down like a champ. By all means I'm not bashing the only other close sushi restaurant but I'm not making it my first choice, second or tenth. The wow factor was lacking and so was the sushi. Sorry Jjanga, you're really not that deserving.",

This restaurant also has four hibachi tables which is cool and the other half of the restaurant is for sushi. The menu has  a good variety of appetizers, nigiri, burritos, classic rolls and other house special rolls. The drink menu has a good variety of sake, cocktails, beer and wine. The sushi is good and the rice is small enough on the nigiri that you can enjoy the fish. It is a little loud in here with the combination of people, music, and hibachi performances. This is definitely a locals spot because it is waaaay off the strip. The ambiance is nice and is very hip! Now, if you're from Hawaii.... this place is like Genki Sushi, sooooo IF YOU KNOW...

The managers noticed we didn't come in one week and asked what happened and I said we were out of town for my grandmas funeral and they hugged me and it was really sweet. They are like a family there. Ray and Nick are the coolest guys. Nick always took time to catch up with us and make us feel welcomed. We unfortunately moved across town so it's just too far to go to. But I love the service and servers here. The food is excellent. It's hard finding sushi on this side that is as great and welcoming like Jjanga. The garlic tuna, halibut, mountain roll are my go-tos. Their bulgogi is my favorite around town!!",

It took a few mins for someone to greet us , than got  seated. That wasn't a problem. Service was very slow and our waiter was complete trash !!! Young asian kid was our server . After getting our drinks he asked if we're doing all you can eat which we did . It took nearly 20 mins to get a few orders of nigiri & one roll. I asked what's a popular roll & his reply was look in the back ! Than we asked if the surf & turf roll was good , he replied \"I don't like it \". Upon delivering our Hawaiian roll I asked what was the pink sauce on the plate & he shrugged his shoulders & walked away. Nigiri wasn't fresh , it was mediocre at best . The surf & turf roll was TERRIBLE, the seared beef was RAW ! We had to ask another employee to refill our waters. We decided not to order any more food cause we were being ignored . I wouldn't recommend this place at all . All the way around it was a bad experience.",

We would scrap it up and add a piece of meat or dip in a gravy/sauce.  A delicious one bite morsel!  Would love to go back for their burgers and/or try their AYCE sushi menu.

Their fish is fairly fresh and their service is good too, but sometimes they will have some servers working there that don't care as much about the business and that's why I rate this one 4 stars. The manager should be able to identify when servers are not performing accordingly. But putting the service apart and taking a close look at their food, I really like their no write sushi options and all you can eat deal. You can't go wrong with all you can eat if you are that hungry.  Thanks to their commitment to build a better restaurant,  is they have acquired their alcohol license, allowing customers to enjoy a crash Sake, or a Japanese beer while dining there. This is a good option if you are looking for something affordable and safe.",

It started right when we came in and met Ellen.  Talk about knowing how to treat your customers right.  She was very personable and welcoming.  This was our first time, but we felt like this was our normal hangout spot.  We started off with drinks at the bar and it kept getting better from there.     We decided to try hibachi and met Tony ... he was awesome and kept us entertained and cooked us a scrumptious meal.  Not gonna lie we were a loud group being just the three of us but I think we kept him entertained as well.    Our group each tried one of the specials so we got a variety of meats and seafood and our recommendation is try try try everything !!!   For drinks I recommend the grapefruit sake ... Probably dangerous because it was so delicious but you gotta have sake when you eat right ???     Overall it was sooo fun and I would definitely recommend you bringing friends and loved ones here.   If you see Ellen, the manager say hello and buy her a shot she works hard !!!  Oh and Tony too ... Thanks for a great time JJANGA !!!",

We came on a Saturday when they opened at 11am so we had the place all to ourselves. We had an awesome time stuffing our faces.   The staff took orders after orders with a smile and obviously lots of patience from fickle minded me. I was quite overwhelmed coz I felt that I didn't order fast enough and I forget what I ordered!!!! One item here and there instead of the the normal \"writing down your order on a slip and have it for reference\". Other than that, I ate everything I ordered and craved for more but with kids, it's almost impossible to enjoy and eat enough food at a AYCE.   I recommend you get the dinner AYCE menu. It's available any time of the day and It includes dishes that is not available on the lunch menu.   Example, oysters, sea urchin, (it's printed in red on the menu). I would also recommend you to not come too hungry to a point of being delirious (hurhur) so you can pay extra attention to the menu and what this awesome restaurant has in store for your tastebuds and your money's worth of food.  We didn't, so we will be back. For now I'll leave you guys with pictures. My baby is screaming for my attention now. Lol.",

I would definitely request him next time I go.   We ordered the jjanga special as well as the two item entree. The shrimp cracker appetizer (which kind of tasted like crab) was super yummy and was a great start to the dinner. Wasn't a big fan of the salad but the soup was unique and yummy! For the entree we had shrimp, lobster, filet, and chicken. What I like was that if you paid $9.99 extra, you could get an extra order of soup, salad, rice, and noodles and then share the entrees.   Since it was super filling we did not get to try desserts but there's always next time!!",

They do AYCE but do not offer half rolls which is a drawback, in my mind, when exploring a new menu. The menu is fairly deep offering selections based upon spiciness,  tempura,  baked, deep fried and more though 'spicy' is a featured word on the menu. The servers were pleasant,  efficient and the food pretty good.  If you're in the area,  stop by but a bit out of the way for me to be a regular.",

It is a good place for just 2 people or a big group. Definitely worth trying out.",

However, boy did my perspective change after visiting! The provocatively named dishes were hilarious, very vegas-esque, and delicious. The menu had a very nice variety. I was very pleased to know that I could have as much mochi ice cream as my heart desired and as my stomach could contain. Although, the mochi was $2 and some other items on the menu were pricey, so I would suggest not dinning a-la-carte.   The staff members were very friendly and extremely patient. I would definitely dine here again the next time I visit the area!",

You strategically try to time your orders to overlap so there is a constant flow of food to the table and then like clockwork about 30-40 minutes in there is like a huge 15-20 minute pause of people sitting around holding their chopsticks going wtf?! Its usually because a few orders were over looked and now everybody is ready to go home and tap a nap and not finish eating. If Jjanga could get the quality of service down as good at the quality of fish then id always be here. Im so glad they opened the new location in the Southwest though... i wont stop going, just not as often.",

We rarely ever have to wait long for the food we order and they never mess up. Which unfortunately happens to us almost every time we venture to a new sushi place.   They offer half rolls at the bar, and my favorite part is the deserts. AYCE ice cream come included, which is awesome considering everywhere else we go they give you one tiny scoop of ice cream and you leave with your sweet tooth completely not satisfied.   Their cuts of nigiri are rather small, but so fresh tasting and the flavors are on point. Which is big for us because it is 90% of what we eat when doing AYCE, besides, is size really that important when it's AYCE?   The rolls I've only had a few of, but they've never disappointed.   The music is your typical K-Pop mixed with modern day Kesha/EDM type, they also offer Karaoke in the room next door along with teppanyaki.   Fresh fish, delicious selection, awesome deserts, and great service. What more are you really looking for in sushi?",

Honestly thought it was gonna be all hype but I genuinely loved it. The ambiance is also 5 stars. Super cute and chill decor, Early 2000s r&b/hip hop playing (also our fave), and the servers were so friendly. All the waiters check on you, not just your own server.

    "text": "This review is only for the sushi side of Jjanga. There are a ton of AYCE sushi places in Vegas so in order for a place to stand out it has to be amazing. For me, Jjanga is amazing in some ways but have some areas they could use on improvement - thankfully some areas that can be addressed almost immediately. My friends & I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday & the price being at ~$20 was definitely amazing. Not only does their menu include what you'd see at a typical AYCE sushi place (nigiri, rolls, appetizers) but it also has a section for sushi burritos & they have fries which is different. So the $20 definitely goes a long way. In terms of the sushi, the fish tastes fresh however there seems to be something different when it comes to the rice.. the only way I can describe it is the rice seems to break apart when you try to pick the sushi up with your chop sticks leaving a huge mess & also the fish seems to separate extremely easily from the rice. Something just seems off.. The appetizers were okay. The edamame tasted old & the fries were nothing special but what do you expect, it's a sushi place. It also took way to long to get appetizers (around 20 min) that we didn't even want to order another round cause we knew it would take forever. The service was a little sparse & it seemed like our table as well as a few other tables were left wondering when someone would be back. The dessert includes four different ice cream flavors which you can choose as many as you want & it was actually really good ice cream.   Overall, the fish itself was comparable to what you get in other sushi places in Vegas & the dessert is great ice cream. However, the assembly of the sushi doesn't seem right with the rice, the service is not amazing although everyone is extremely nice!  The appetizers do take a long while so if you're planning on ordering something do it at the beginning. All in all, I would come back because of the variety of choices on the menu & the price!",

Tons of options and the staff is friendly and fast. Ellen, playboy, hand rolls, and nigiri are amazing!",

Tonight I had hibachi for the first time in a long time and our chef obviously knew the other guests at the table. He gave me and my two friends a far less amount of rice, veggies, & meat then the other guests as he made multiple rounds on their side of the table. He also cooked the other guests food before ours and after they got their food, he started cooking our steaks. Due to the large lack of attention to our side of the table I wasn't able to get words in onto how I wanted some of my food prepared, even though I told the server beforehand as well. I just felt like it was uncomfortable that we had to listen to them making plans to hang out the upcoming days and only talking to each other. The food was good, but the service made the experience very unenjoyable.",

At the end of the meal, my friend and I saw they had a deal where if we rated them 5 stars and showed our server that we would get a sample of the Korean cream cookie or what not. I tried to ask a server how that works and they said they don't sell it and didn't carry it, so I'm confused! Instead I settled for red bean ice cream.  Second time my friend and I came not even in a week's time, this time we sat at the tables closest to the wall and away from the teppanyaki tables. Service was a little slower but expected because we were not at the bar. Our beverages were filled constantly which I really appreciated. Means the busser/server was actually keeping an eye out for us   However dessert time came and I ordered red bean ice cream again however I was not PLEASED AT ALL! I don't know how long that ice cream has been used but the red beans were SOUR! Definitely a no no for me. Might be a while before we even consider coming back here.",

    "text": "I have to give credit where credit is due - positive changes in the service & improved quality in sushi inspired an updated review.   The fella talked me into giving them a try again, since he always had good hibachi. I was hesitant, wanting AYCE sushi, and had terrible sushi the last couple of visits.  The one downside we found out upon walking in, is that I couldn't do AYCE sushi on the hibachi side- and the fella can't have hibachi at the grill on the sushi side -so minus a star before being seated. Once seated, service was great; refills on point, no asking again & again for things or wondering where dishes were, all much improved from times before.  Sushi side: I tried the yuzu yellowtail, the veggie screaming \"o\" salad and the Burning Your Ass Roll promising spice. My mind has been changed on their sushi- tasty and fresh all around. Good spice and textures on the roll - getting that one AGAIN. The salad was a little clunky and over-dressed, maybe a squeeze of lemon or chopped tomatoes to cut the richness would have made it perfect. All-in-all I am looking forward to coming in for AYCE sushi for another try.  As usual, a good hibachi experience... actually, the our food off the grill was better than before - they used a different butter/oil that was not the pink-ish one they used to use, and the result was a very tasty mix of veggies, noodles, medium rare filet steak and DELISH rice... really good rice!  There's a little work needed to strive for gold, but I give my most recent experience here a solid silver and much improved.",

We were the only two at the bar & there were two small tables, not busy at all.  We ordered All You Can Eat $25.95, usually a great deal as you see from my previous reviews... however Koo Koo was not on this shift who is the best.    Also there was a horrible stench of sewer like the sink was backing up behind the sushi counter.  I would've walked out, but we didn't smell it until after ordering.  The Age Dashi Tofu was horrible.  Fried tofu in a soupy mess so the fried part melted off.  $3 of wasted calories.    The FreshMen riceless roll was watery & had too much radish & only a sliver of avocado for the whole roll.  I usually get this to so I know what it's suppose to taste like.  $9  Something Wrong 69 is also our usual, but was just ok.  $9  The best part was the small seaweed salad $4, salmon & yellowtail sushi, 2 pcs $4.  Wonder why when I ordered 4 salmon we got seven pieces not eight.  Also we never got the octopus & the sushi in the right fridge was better than the sushi bar fridge on the left cause our second plate of sushi was ok.  Nothing special.    For $63, All you can eat was not worth it this time, thankfully we had a large sake!  Very sad to say I won't be back for awhile.  Quite awhile.  Horrible experience.",

Service was exceptional; our waiter and waitress came to our table frequently considering we did AYCE for lunch.   When I usually go to a new restaurant, I tend to ask what their popular items are and our server was able to do just that. He recommended the Something Wrong #69 (which we got- it was ok) and also pointed out the \"No Rice Roll\" section (we got the Freshmen- it was alright). My boyfriend and I loved their Grand Canyon sushi which is listed under their \"Baked Rolls\" portion. The dynamite topping was soo yummmm, which reminded me of a sushi roll that we both seem to always order back home in Hawaii.  Overall, we're satisfied of their quality of sushi; fresh, tasty, and affordable!",

It didn't seem dim and the restaurant had more of an open feel. They have a bar near the entrance that allows you to enjoy a cocktail while waiting.   We arrived at the perfect time because it wasn't busy YET! They have both sushi tables and tepan tables so you could enjoy either. We opted for a sushi table. Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink order. The food came out quick, really quick actually. So either they were prepared for tonight or they just got the food prep down. Quality of sushi....fresh! Sweet shrimp, yuzu yellowtail, garlic tuna and uni!  I tried the Q roll which is one of their riceless rolls and wasn't a huge fan, a bit disappointing. I had heard alot about the riceless rolls so i was curious. The white fish thry used tasted tough and cooked so definitely not the flavor i was expecting. The AYCE menu is larger than the other AYCE spots I've been too, so I was able to try a lot more dishes Vs just sushi or nigiri.  Service was great, they work more as a team there it seems. So you don't just have one server, but multiples.   Looks like we found another AYCE joint.",

    "text": "Been a little sushi obsessed lately so here I am writing another review for yet another sushi establishment. Sorry, not sorry. Like others who have reviewed before me, this is an all-you-can-eat type place, so snobs need not apply. You get good, tasty, creative sushi for a good price, and that's all I require.   Not only is the bang for your buck good here, the service is also great. Bringing out plates and clearing as you go; always coming back to take your next order. I love that they don't rush you out and give you time between each dish. The ENTIRE MENU (minus the very few items in red type) is on the all-you-can-eat menu. So, go ahead and get 6 orders of potstickers... you and your $20 deserve it.   The potstickers were crispy and not greasy. Definitely a top appetizer choice. Some of my favorite rolls are the Yellow Yellow, Sexy Time, and the Fresh Men Roll. First two are spicy, last one is no rice. All amazing and different.   There is a lunch special menu as well that mainly consists of Sushi Burritos and poke bowls, but looks scrumptious, although I haven't tried it yet. Also, if you aren't in the mood to gorge yourself you can always order a la carte. Although, if you decide to get more than two rolls, you might as well go all-you-can-eat.   All in all, a great quick spot to pop by for lunch during the day, drinks in the evening or a date night. Great atmosphere and music. Definitely will be a regular given how close it is to my workplace. Dangerously close? Probably.",

Since I've moved on, my family and I have dined with jjanga, hibachi style, and have never been disappointed, ever. Even the pickiest of kids get down in the food and entertainment.  Last night, the wife and I got to go out to eat, no children!!! Instead of hibachi, we finally were able to sit at the sushi bar and have some fun. Our hostess, Ellen, made us feel like we were VIPs, always making sure our glasses were full and really cultivating that welcoming atmosphere. She truly excels in making her guest feel like family. She makes it look easy.  We started with crab balls, which were perfect. Spicy edamame was a great snack. Grapefruit sake.... More please! We started off plain Jane sushi wise, with a delicious rainbow roll and some halibut and Ono. Everything was perfect with the ono being the star.. Then we tried the candy cane roll, the Hawaiian, and a riceless Naruto. All delicious, with the candy cane really being the all star of the whole night. We then moved into shrimp tempura rolls, something wrong #69 (at the sushi chef's recommendation) and another great roll that I can't recall the name of... Wife tapped out here and left me with a lot of sushi to down myself, I really didn't have any problems!!!! We finished with a few rounds of shots, some strawberry mochi, and positive vibes.  Jjanga had really become one of my go to places. The kids love it, they treat you like family, and the cuisine is way above par. Very, very great. I'm already looking forward to next time.  Also, many kudos to the restaurant staff, especially the sushi chefs and the bussers. We walked in around 7 and the place was slammed. Fully packed house, and everyone was polite and welcoming. They didn't transcend their stress to the guest, which is huge. The sushi chefs had tickets up the wazoo, but you would never know. They were calm, cool, and collected, and we just watched them pump out beautiful roll after beautiful roll all night long.  Shaun",

By the end of the meal, I was too stuffed for dessert and went into a food coma, which means it definitely was an amazing meal!   Awesome sushi place to go to off the strip, it's cheaper and less crowded.",

What made my burger amazing was the deep fried rice bun.   This burger will fill you up. I barely finished it and it's only $9. I tried the Karai burger which had spicy tuna, spicy soft shell crab, salmon, cucumber, lettuce and special sauce. It was too big to just take a bite out of so I ate everything separately. Still amazing.   Also, there is a Korean Ice Cream Sandwich with red bean, vanilla ice cream and Mochi for dessert. It's free if you write a review. I wasn't too big of a fan of this dessert. It tasted a bit stale.   Overall great customer service. I would come back here to try another burger.",

    "text": "OBSESSED! (And honored this place is my 100th yelp review btw!) I am dubbed a \"sushi snob,\" but this is seriously my new Japanese go-to for AYCE sushi! We just moved and are new to the area, were very skeptical about trying new places (and only ended up here because SOHO on Jones are closed!) -- but we've been here TWICE in the last two weeks because it's THAT good!  All-you-can-eat lunch (from 11:30AM-3:00PM) is $20.95, and dinner until close is $25.95. SO WORTH THE PRICE! They have a very extensive menu with appetizer side dishes, soup & salad, special sashimi, nigiri sushi, vegetable rolls, hand rolls (sushi burritos!), classic rolls, no rice rolls, and a looong list of shrimp tempura rolls, spicy rolls, baked rolls, non-spicy special rolls and deep fried rolls! Did I mention they are open until 2:00AM?! (Last call for AYCE is at 1:30AM btw!)  I highly recommend... APPETIZERS: - Golden scallop (one order per person) - Who's your daddy (I think they took this off the original menu recently) - Vegetable tempura - Dynamite - Crab ball - Cocaine (special sashimi) SUSHI: - Grand Canyon (I think this is my favorite!) - Dancing eel roll (This is like butter! So smooth!) - Jjanga special roll (They took this off the menu, but if you're lucky the chef at the bar might make it still!) - Spider roll (A classic you can't go wrong with) - Johnny roll (No rice roll with a nice twist!) - Surf & Turf roll (So many flavors in this one!) - Salmon nigiri (All their nigiri listed below is SO fresh!) - Salmon belly nigiri - Uni nigiri - Albacore nigiri  - Cajun albacore - Cajun tuna albacore - Oysters (one order per person)  PRO TIP: They also offer hibachi teppanyaki on the other side of the restaurant, and have a full bar as well!  YELP TIP: Write a yelp review and get an asian ice cream sandwich for FREE! Omg, so good! Ice cream x red bean paste in a waffer sandwich!",

At around $27 for their AYCE, their rolls seemed to be more tasteful than what we were used to. Plentiful and quick, we quickly gobbled the deliciousness. What I liked better here than the other was the selection seemed to be more and quality was better.   Establisment was clean and servers were great.

They also do uber eats which delivers very well and quality is consistent! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  My fav sushi spot in town  Sooo as of September of 2019  I made an uber eat delivery on the 5th of September at 8:46 pm  And let me tell you  That the food was trash !  The fish smelled spoiled  And gross i wanted to throw up after eating it. I called to make sure they know I am not looking for a refund I just want to warn my fellow people about this spot!Me and my gf came here for 3 weeks 3 Times a week and it was great But the second they give u spoiled raw salmon  Literally is the end Like this shit can poison you and kill you. Spoiled raw fish is no joke  And if they allowed for it to be served  Maybe its time i call health inspection... I probably will soon.  Thanks for trying to poison me with your trash fish.",

    "text": "We've been coming here for quite sometime now, since around the time it first opened. We have never have a bad experience here, ever!   I could talk about all the times we have come here and how amazing the sushi was, but today was my first experience here when it comes to Teppanyaki.   We walked to the front door and it was jammed packed inside. Barely even enough room to get by anyone, just to check in. The atmosphere was loud but friendly. Wasn't obnoxious by any means, since there are TVs on both sides of the restaurant and its a popular spot so we expected the place to be crowded. We scooted past the ton of people up front and made contact with the hostess.    This is where it started off a bit rough. My wife made reservations for 4 and when we checked in we told them everyone was here. We had four people in our party (Me, the wife, and our two boys). This was for my sons 11th birthday party. They told us it would be a few minutes and it was. They called my wife's name and they walked us right past the Teppanyaki tables. Me and the wife looked at each other and though \"where are we going?\". My wife flagged the lady down and asked where we were going. We advised the hostess we had reservations for Teppanyaki table. Well, they walked us back to the front and told us to wait a few seconds. Another lady came up to the hostess and said that we only made reservations for two people. The wife and I looked at each other again with confusion (there could not be a mistake on this on our end).   Soo a few seconds later, the hostess walks us (all four of us) to the Teppanyaki table and sat us down. We were sat down right on time with our reservations and there was plenty of seating available.   We ordered some drinks and looked at the menu.  The wife and I ordered the Grapefruit Sake and some waters. We have had this Sake before and its soooo good! We just keep getting this every time we comes here.   I ordered the 3 item dinner and ordered Scallops, Salmon, and Shrimp. Wife ordered the 2 item dinner, and she ordered Filet along with Shrimp.   Our experience was great, the \"cook/chef\" (don't know the exact term here lol sorry), was awesome. Pretty friendly and of course did all the fancy things they do when they make this type of dinner. Dinner turned out to be delicious and it was just the right amount of food. Heck, we had a bit left over so our 13 year old ate all what was left from our plates. Killed it!!   If this were my first experience here, I probably would have given it a 4 star rating but like I said before, we have come here a lot. That one little small hick-up was not enough to steer me to the 4 star category. I would recommend the Teppanyaki to those who haven't tried it here!   For us, the wifey and I will probably stick to the Sushi side like we always do but definitely will look into the Teppanyaki if we had a good group of people looking for this kind of experience/dinner.   Overall its amazing!! Always one of the first places I recommend to all of my friends for Sushi.   See you soon JJANGA!!!!!",

    "text": "We were so excited to finally try this place! It was a perfect lunch spot during our Vegas trip, although it's a little far from the strip.   The All you can eat menu with a lot, and I mean a lot, of food options was a no brainer. The menu is neatly organized with different type of rolls & various categories. It made it very easy to order! So we went with that and also ordered the famous sushi burger.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. Service was speedy but because we beat the lunch rush on a Saturday.   The only reason I am not giving this restaurant 5 stars is because some of the rolls we ordered were not as tasty as they look. I feel like they should have been more savory but unfortunately they were somewhat unimpressive. Even the sushi burger was not as succulent as it looks on their instagram. Kind of Disappointing. However, the other rolls were good and I would get them again.   Parking is shared among all the other businesses in the plaza but it's a big lot so it's not a big deal.  Final verdict, will I visit again? Most likely only if I'm in the area and want a fairly priced AYCE sushi meal.",

    "text": "My wife and I are assembling our new \"Go To\" list of restaurants since moving to Las Vegas. As a result we have been trying out restaurant, after restaurant trying to find that one \"fill in blank\" restaurant per category...Italian, Sushi, etc.  I consider myself a sushi snob after having taken a number of courses from well known sushi chef's, etc. Most sushi restaurants don't understand that it all starts with rice preparations.   Sooo I see on yelp that Jjanga has 1300 reviews with a 4.5 star rating. Wow this is a place I needed to check out.  My wife and I arrived at 4:30pm and were immediately taken to a table in front of the sushi bar. Our waiter quickly got our drink orders and answered a few questions we had.  The decor is upscale, fresh and open. The music was 80's & 90's. All in all set up a very pleasant environment. So far a very enjoyable start.  My wife ordered a plate of gyoza, veggie roll with sour cream, and a bowl of miso soup. The wife enjoyed the gyoza as it was crispy and not greasy. The bowl of miso soup had plenty of seaweed and tofu in the broth. She felt it was one of the best miso soups she had ever had. The Veggie roll came without the requested cream cheese. They took it back and had small pieces put on top of each roll. We were okay with that.  I ordered the All You Can Eat (AYCE) meal. Here is where they started dropping points in my mind. I ordered a Philadelphia  and Eel roll first. Along comes my wife's gyoza....then the veggie roll (which goes back) and then out comes the miso soup...I'm still sitting there watching my wife eat ( I told her she needn't wait). When they finally bring my wife's veggie roll back, I get served my two rolls.  Note: we were one of five (5) table with customers. One of five! Not busy here!  The rice was as it should be (big star here) and kept the roll from falling apart. The eel in the Eel roll was dry but okay. The Philadelphia roll was also okay. When the food had been dropped the waiter did not ask if I had a second order to be placed. He just dropped the two plates and immediately turned.  I waited with empty plates for almost 15 minutes before he finally came back to see if I wanted another course. I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Smoked salmon roll. I then waited....and waited....for another ten minutes. At which time the Dragon roll was delivered. This roll was quite good and the roll was moist and flavorful. Then I waited...and waited again. I had a waitress and waiter stop by to ask if I was waiting of an order. As soon as I said yes they were off and didn't ask if I wanted something. Eventually the Smoked Salmon was delivered. The waiter dropped it and immediately turned again without asking if I would want anything else. I finished the smoked salmon roll but couldn't really enjoy it. I was getting upset with the waiting game being played with regards to the AYCE. There is a total time of one hour and it was coming up on it.   As a waitress was walking by, I slide my seat back and got her attention. I ordered some eel & salmon. These were delivered right at the bewitching minute. When I had finished the 6 pieces of fish the waiter came to the table to ask if we were ready for our check.   I get it that the restaurant wants to limit the amount of food that someone might want to eat but that's the risk you take as a restaurant. You might get someone who can eat a sizable amount or one that eats much less than the cost. The AYCE price is typically the average of the two types of customers. To not visit a table to limit the food, also means that we were also not asked if our drinks needing filling, might need a napkin, if there was an issue, etc.  I so wanted this to be my \"Go To\" sushi restaurant. The obvious waiting game means that it won't be in the running.",

I'm from LA and we can't even get these prices there.  Like how the hell they get their fish to the desert and still make money off these prices?  We ordered a ton.  Sushi tacos. Sushi burgers (they're big!!!!!!! clock that, almost too big)  I like their oysters flavoring.  OMG their sizzling UDON is to die for!!!  I love yaki-udon and you can't get good versions hardly anywhere even in LA and they killed it for $5 happy hour.  Drinks are cheap too.  Like this place is a fun trip. So glad we stopped by here before getting maimed on the strip.",

I knew we were in a trying meal when he scorched the eggs in making fried rice.  Had I known about the fried rice (given a choice) I would have opted for steamed rice.  The steaks were not seared but were only colored with what looked like oyster sauce. It was first time for me that a chef poured a mayo based sauce on scallops. Perhaps that is how they fill the gap between traditional Japanese teppanyaki and what is popular with local tastes.   I can see why they don't offer free WiFi for guests. Otherwise we would be posting reviews throughout the meal.   On the bright side, our greeters and servers were friendly and quick to service our table.    I have heard that prior visits to Jjang were quite good. That is the main reason why we wanted to celebrate a birthday dinner on this night.  We are going to celebrate birthday cake and ice cream at home.  It will be our recovery attempt for a disappointing dinner.  Here is my verdict of my meal tonight.  Expected better and got the worst.",

Our server was sweet & menu knowledgeable as well. I like seeing a well trained staff. The restaurant was clean prompt snd the dishes were good.

During Our lunch break we are limited to 60 min and by the time we get there and leave we actually only have 40 minutes to eat. Today we came and they seated two other parties in front of ours. It seams like they dont like there job. The girl who takes our order seams to get mad because we have our order list ready as soon as she sits us down in a table, in which I would think it would be easier for her and we have to always ask her to come to us to place another order! she says wait and makes a frowning face and takes time to get back to us.. If we don't ask she will not come to check up on our table . I understand that they are short staffed but there costumer service needs to be better. It seams they are not meant for the job....  HI IN REGARDS TO YOUR ANSWER WE HAVE ALWAYS CAME IN AND THE REST OF OUR GROUP HAVE CAME A FEW MINUTES LATER DUE TO OUR LIMITED LUNCH TIME AND THEY HAD TO STAY BACK TO FINISH WORK AND THAT NEVER SEEMED TO BE THE PROBLEM BEFORE !!! THEY WOULD SEAT US AT A TABLE KNOWING HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE COMING MINUTES LATER :)",

When we place our order she acts like if we're bothering her when it's in her job description to take our order. They are always short in staff and the owner is always runnjng around with the food because they don't have enough people working there. I agree that we might not be an easy group to tend to, because we come in a large group, so we try and have a list of our order before hand to help out the server. Even with the list being given to them, it takes a long time. Today we went in and were treated very rude and weren't seated when there was at least 3 tables open, and the blonde lady in the front told us to sit and took two other parties before us even though we were there before them.",

    "text": "I'm giving a two because the overall experience wasn't terrible. Based off of the dining experience alone it's hard to say if I'd come back. Nothing special. If the following didn't happen, I would have never thought to leave a review good or bad.   But with their bait and switch tactic and poor guest recovery from the manager, I'm sure I won't be back.   They claim to have happy hour after 10pm, $20.95 for AYCE. We called to confirm, they confirmed. Cool.   We show up just after 10pm, as our date night planned (we stopped for dessert first, sometimes you just gotta live life.) We're greeted pretty quickly and I order us waters and sake directly off the happy hour menu. Again confirming this $20.95 late night special. Sweet.   Our dinner passes with nothing abnormal. Had to ask for some stuff twice, but no biggie. Negi Hama was awesome while their nigiri was pretty sad small slices on top of gummy rice. But you get what you pay for right?  Well, not always it seems.   Shame on me after a few drinks throughout the evening for not inspecting the bill more closely. But when I woke up, my mind was still racing. Something didn't add up.   So I called the restaurant and quickly was being helped track down my receipt and the cause for the price disparity. The woman on the phone took down my information, but not without her tone to ensure I knew what a hassle this was for her.   But I was ready to forgive when I received a text with my receipt not too long later. Seems like it wasn't so difficult after all. I explained (the rest is via text mind you, she never bothered to call back) that there must have been some confusion, as you can see we were there for the happy hour price. Simple refund of the difference of $12 and we would be on our way. Maybe one day I would return for a late night sushi craving.   Life is never this simple. Turns out I had been duped. Their happy hour excluded any item they considered premium she was happy to point out with a :)   I asked if this is printed on the menu to which I received no direct response. This leads me to believe it isn't, but I'll happily be proved wrong if someone wants to actually answer my question.   I let her know our server absolutely did not mention any of this which seems odd as we immediately ordered happy hour and arrived shortly after 10pm. To any trained server it should have been evident that we were there for... drumroll please... happy hour!  Turns out this manager is more than pleased to train her staff on how to accurately do their jobs. Love to hear it. On the job training and continued education are crucial to most businesses. She's also more than willing to buy me a round of sake the next time I'm in.   Thanks for the offer! However it seems a bit unjust of a recovery compared to the $12 difference I was calling in regards to. After all their happy hour sake is $5 which is high compared to many other sake happy hours in town as it is. I'm not sure how asking me to come back to spend another $30 for my meal alone just for a free drink really adds up, but perhaps management needs training, too?  I'm just not impressed with anything I've experienced with this restaurant. Which is a shame because their Instagram photos really do excite the taste buds. But like the rest of social media, some things don't match up in real life.",

Skip the soy sauce on most rolls as you can see they are often dressed as they should be already.

    "text": "First off, this is supposed to be a place to dine not dance, so when you have to yell your conversation to the people at your table your music is way too loud! We had been here a couple of times when it was Kanji then once when they switched right in the beginning and wasn't impressed then, but took another chance seeing all the 4 and 5 star reviews, which, I assure you is unfounded. It isn't the worst sushi joint that we've eaten at, but I would be hard pressed to say that it isn't pretty close to the bottom and we could never recommended it. Now on to the food...I usually try to find something positive to write in my reviews but I'm having a hard time coming up with anything. The only thing that was liked at the table was the seaweed salad, which I'm pretty sure they buy already prepared and a couple of the appetizers (Bulgogi and Shrimp Tempura). The rolls were small with paper thin stamp sized cuts of fish and unfortunately with most of them over powered with sauce. They have plenty of staff and all were very friendly except they all circle around the dining room like hawks waiting to pounce, felt like I was in prison being examined every couple of minutes. Don't get me wrong, I love an attentive wait staff, but not so much that they smoother you. The sushi chefs failed to impress in presentation of both the food and themselves, all being dressed in street clothes wearing backwards baseball caps, looking very disheveled and very young. Age and training could be the culprit here on the lackluster food as well as the constant hovering with the wait staff. At the conclusion of dinner with a small bowl of ice cream the the most disappointing part of the evening came to be...the check. Now mind you there weren't any mistakes, other than I felt what we were charged and paying for was far more then what we received! Sorry, we won't be back :(",

I think we dined on THE WORST NIGHT. First, the restaurant was HOT because one of the AC units stopped working. Second, the service was slow. No one came to our table to offer refills or to ask if we wanted another beer. I wanted more freakin sushi but didn't have a chance to order because again we weren't checked on. We had our two children with us and I had to walk to the bar to ask for refills of their beverage. After being there for an hour and still not being serviced my family got up and walked to the counter to pay. I mentioned my disappointment to the manager on duty and he response was that they will do better next time then I felt insulted with the fact he tried to compensate with giving my children Dollar Store toys for the kids. The service we received is NOT what we are use to from JJanga. I hope he reads this because I'm sure he would be mortified that his long time customers were treated so poorly.",

You can order cucumber salad, mushroom balls, mussels, & a plethora of wild and X-rated rolls.   There is so much to choose from and appetizers  and ice cream are included in the all you can eat.   This is a great find.  The atmosphere is cool, clean, comfortable & Very Hip!   Try it if you even kinda like Sushi:)  The Female Sushi Chefs are friendly in a no talking kind of way.  Seriously!!! They are The Real Quiet Women of Las Vegas!   Enjoy!",

All of the dishes that came out were really delicious (sorry, i can't remember what we ordered since it was so much, but we basically went for everything that was \"one item only,\" and then some sushi rolls!).   Some members of our group (actually, most of them) were late and they were really accommodating about seating us when most of us were there and letting us start with drinks, then ordering food when the rest of our group arrived.   The waitress was really great about putting the cake in the fridge for us and bringing it out with plates and forks. And no cake cutting fee! Thank you for that!   Good food and really great service. Be careful not to accidentally go to the decatur location! :b  Note: ama ebi does not come with the heads! sad times.",

We sat down and did the all you can eat with 6 gals, there was a lot of food! Drinks were always full, food came out super fast and the plates were picked up pretty much as soon as they were clear. Everything was great, I did have a few pieces of fish that were a little tough to chew which is definitely not desirable,  however it was in one roll. The roll selection is awesome as well as the apps.  During our dinner, the woman who greeted us and was also the bartender brought us over a round of shots on the house which was so unexpected and fun, totally made the experience that much better!

Their teppanyaki side has everything you would expect! Good seating around the stove, an entertaining chef, and most importantly delicious food! Idk if it was just this specific visit or not, but it definitely felt like that the food was not only cooked and prepped conserve but it was fast! I've been to other teppanyaki places before and it felt like forever before I was able to eat, but to my knowledge not here at jjanga!  Second time - sushi side I can say that this is now top 3 sushi places in Vegas for me. They have a huge selection and whats crazy is that they have items that I've never seen at other sushi restaurants! I also love that they have a specific \"no rice\" section for all the peeps that are watching carb intake! I'm a huge fan of fried rolls so to have a section labeled just for me, I was def awe struck.   All in all this a great restaurant, and a great venue weather it be eating alone at the sushi bar or hosting a party at either the teppanyaki or sushi side! Ambience is casual and the music they got playing are def songs you can jam out to while stuffing your mouth!",

ACYE is the price point you would expect.$21 for lunch and $26 for dinner. The only downside is that they dont offer half rolls even with AYCE. Not good for someone who comes solo.",

Ally You Can Eat is $25/person with a large selections of items and they have it every day. We tried around six rolls as well as the octopus appetizer and veggie tempura. Everything was delicious. We were also surprised at how quickly they were able to get everything out considering how busy it became and how good everything looked. The octopus appetizer was really good and worth trying. It was fried and then coated in teriyaki sauce. I'd say the two most memorable rolls were: Japanese Lasagna and The Sun Devil. The veggie tempura was also very good and the right portion.   If you have an opportunity to try their teppanayaki it too is worth it.",

    "text": "Yikes. This place has 4 stars with over 300 reviews?! Incredible. My boyfriend and I came to lunch here the other day and it was one of the worst sushi experiences I've had in a while. There was no hostess at the front when we walked in, so we stood around waiting for about 5 minutes (it was 12pm, not a weird time).  We were greeted by the hostess once she came out of the back somewhere and seated in the dining room. Our waiter was super nice and took our order promptly, but then got insanely busy-- he was the only server working and had over 10 tables at one point.  Needless to say this was a recipe for disaster. He forgot my salad, had to be asked 3x for lemons, and when we asked for our check we were held hostage while he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off tending to his other tables... forgetting to close us out.  Furthermore, the sushi was just not good. The tuna was very muscular, chewy and inedible. The spicy tuna roll was so spicy it was inedible (and that means a lot coming from me, I absolutely LOVE spicy). It was so spicy it left me wondering if they were trying to mask the flavor of old fishy fish or something.... anyhow, it didn't matter because the seaweed was so wet and gummy it was like chewing a fish flavored piece of gum with a ghost pepper wrapped in the middle.  My boyfriend had the salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and  tuna nigiri and he too said it was the worst sushi he's had in Vegas. The only reason I'm affording this place 2 stars is because I felt so sorry for the server. I mean, it's not his fault the restaurant was understaffed. We won't be coming here again.",

When we placed our order we were the only customer in the restaurant.  3. 45 min into my wait I ask a different server what the hold up is and he said it would be right out.

There was no reason why the service would be so slow, but it was. They had one server and a manager looking lady and two chefs at the bar. We ordered miso soup and pumpkin soups and some appetizers to start off. Despite their empty restaurant, the foods came out cold and very late. When the nigiris came out, there was so much rice that we could not dare to start eating. We definitely did not eat all the rice and did not care if they charged us or not. The server said \"oh really?\" When we said the foods were cold, did not take any action about it or apologize. The nigiris were definitely tasteless since the fish was cut so thin and small.   When this place first opened, it was top notch, being rated the number 1 sushi bar in town. Couple years later, this place definitely cannot catch up the trend of new sushi restaurants like Neko or Sakana. If I am paying the same price, I would just drive a little further from house and enjoy good service and food from sushi neko.",

Food came out very slow and no utensils which should have been set when we sat down and not after our food was served. Free specials for yelp reviews. Will come back and change to 5 stars when that issue is fixed. More attention would result in better service but need at least 1 to 2 more servers.",

There were 11 of us in our group and only 5 of us opted for the AYCE while the others just ordered from the a la carte menu. So imagine how crazy that can get. I love my family but to be honest, they can be a bit difficult sometimes. The staff handled everyone's orders so well. Even though the restaurant was packed everyone in our group felt well taken care of by the staff.   To top it all of, everyone love their sushi. No complaint here on our end. Thank you, Jjanga family for taking care of us last night and kudos to everyone!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner with my husband and parents who were visiting town. I saw that Jjanga was close to my house and it had tons of good reviews and decided to go for it. My first mistake was in not realizing this place is known for AYCE. That was completely my fault for expecting higher quality food, as I know better than to expect great food from an AYCE place. But, the main reason I'm rating this place low is because of the terrible customer service.  We decided to order off the regular menu (not AYCE) since we just wanted some rolls and sashimi. We still ordered a decent amount of food with our final bill totaling around $80, just to point out that I was not being a cheapskate, but unfortunately was treated like one here. My father ordered two appetizers off the cooked menu- baby octopus and beef skewers. These two dishes came out at the very end, about ten minutes after we had finished all the other rolls we ordered. When the baby octopus came out, there were two skewers, one with 1 octopus and the other with 2. They were TINY. I thought that was weird but we already waited so long for the food, so my husband opted out and just let me and my parents have 1 each. They were incredibly overcooked and completely soaked in sauce. I seriously wish I took a picture of it.  Maybe because the service was so incredibly slow here, or because our rolls were just as mediocre as if we'd ordered AYCE (they cut the rolls thinner here, regardless if you're ordering off the regular menu and PAYING more), but I was feeling incredibly disappointed. I have never, ever asked to be comp'ed at a restaurant before. However, I used to be a hostess and I know this happens from time to time, and I figured I had a good reason for asking to be comp'ed for the octopus since they legitimately tasted terrible and were tiny. This appetizer cost $5.50. I figured no big deal. I respectfully asked the waitress if it could be removed from our bill. She then called another woman over (presumably the manager). The first thing she says is \"Well you cleared the plate\". Of course we cleared the plate, there were only three octopus on it and we each had ONE. She says, \"There should have been 4 on the plate. You should have said something when it first came out. You cleared the plate, so...\" Lol I didn't realize it was the customer's job to make sure the restaurant gives us the appropriate amount of food we're paying for? I explained that regardless, the octopus did not taste good and was overcooked/tiny. She said, \"That's just how our food is made here, I can't control that\". She then agreed to comp it as a courtesy, which I do appreciate. However, I would have preferred for her to respectfully decline my request instead of giving me major attitude for a $5.50 dish.  After this whole debacle, THREE separate employees came by to ask \"how we were doing\" (code for \"get out\") when the reason we were still there was because we were STILL waiting for the beef skewers to come out. Which, by the way, were just as tiny and dry as the octopus.",

What we didn't know was that you can only only get steak if you do teppanyaki but you can't do all you can eat if you sit at the teppanyaki tables! Our friends wanted to do the all you can eat so the hubs unfortunately had to miss out on steak and just get sushi & apps.  Everything was very fairly priced because everything was so tiny in comparison to other sushi restaurants.  The sushi was pretty mediocre which was disappointing but the apps weren't bad.  The bench chairs they have you sitting on were super uncomfortable and run down looking kind of like the rest of the place.  We probably won't be back again there are just too many other better places in town.",

Loved the agedashi tofu - crispy on the outside and the tofu melts in your mouth. I like that you can order the rolls with brown rice instead of white, although you'd have to pay $1 extra even if you're doing AYCE. The mocktails are a good concept, esp for those that like mixed drinks but without the alcohol. The arizone sunset mocktail with added pineapple juice was awesome. For rolls, I'd recommed the Next Time roll as well as the old trusy Johnny Roll. I like that they don't try to skimp by overloading the rolls with rice. Laid back, airy, spacious atmosphere and service was quick. And I like that ESPN was on all 3 TVs! 1 star off for not offering half rolls and some of the bulgogi and dynamite was a little on the burnt side. I also wish there was no extra charge for brown rice. Other than that it was awesome.",

Everyone there is friendly and the staff are personable, upbeat and are always offering great suggestions. You have to try the I love my Ass Roll, Q roll, Tuna Naruto, Freshman roll and the Yuzu yellowtail sushi. Oh, and you have to try the Grapefruit sake which is not on the all-you-can-eat obviously. Oh the beef Bulgogi, Gyoza and the crab balls are also a must try. The Fort Apache location closes at midnight and also has a Hibachi option and the Chinatown location I think closes around 2 AM and they also have Karaoke. So, what are you still doing reading this review? Go get in your car and go to JJANGA. Seriously, I'm not kidding.  Go already!",

I came in for AYCE dinner and the service and food was so great that I had to come back in the very next day for Lunch AYCE. I've been in weekly since! The quality and freshness of the Food is outstanding. They also offer a Teppanyaki/hibachi menu and have really fun talented chefs grilling it up. This establishment is great for all occasions, from family dining and date nights, to sushi and drinks with a group of friends (btw they offer pitchers of beer). Also a huge highlight of this place is the owner Jjanga, he has to be one of the most interactive owners I have ever had the pleasure of meeting, he treats guests like family and is often one of the chefs making your sushi, and from my experiences he also has an amazing staff, it seems they got it together and work as a Team, they are all very attentive and eager to please their guests. This place has fine dining type service at a competitive AYCE price, I highly recommend this place to everyone. The Spring Mountain Roll, Taste like my ex girlfriend Roll, big easy roll it's all really really good! Mmm Yuzu Yellowtail, super white tuna, baked green muscles, oysters!!!

Sushi is good, and service is not too bad. however, the seating is a little uncomfortable, and awkward, because you are so close to the table next to you there is no privacy. unless you get a booth by the front door. Also the first time I went with my fiance we waited close to a hour. the second time I called to make a reservation, and the man said that they don't take reservations for parties less then five. So I guess if your on a date, there is no privacy and you have to wait an hour to be seated. not great for my taste. Speaking of taste, the sushi was awesome.. to an extent.  and I don't like my food cold, unless its ment to bee cool. the sushi we got was Luke warm and not okay because the cream cheese was too soft that the roll wasn't the right shape.  Also I believe that there should be one waiter assigned to certain tables. A lot of the time it was 3-4 different people that would come to take your plates and bring you more sushi. however, all of the employees just walk around so fast. its impossible to get their attention. which wouldn't be a problem if my table got touched every once and a while.",

I ordered here for the first time and was super nervous because I've never ordered sushi delivery before so I was very nervous but needed to fix my craving and didn't want to leave the house because I love to get all you can eat sushi because I eat a lot. But I love the fact that they put all the sauce on the side and they're not stingy with it because I was worried what the wet ones would look like or if they would be flipped upside down from the driver but they looked and tasted wonderful I just wish I remembered what the names were by the photos of the rolls I got because there's 2 that I will 100% be ordering again! Was sooo good I didn't want to eat it all so I can save it for later because it was sooo delicious and melted in my mouth with flavor and yumminess. The only thing was the mussels were cold and had barley anything on them. Which I was pretty sad about because that's the one thing I order everywhere and and a large quantity of them. But other than that I had a great experience and wouldn't mind getting delivery from them again.",

    "text": "I so love Facebook for showing this place to me! When the Thrillist post showed that there was something out there called SUSHI BURGERS, I knew it had to be a stop for me in Vegas! I had to see this spectacle with my own two eyes!!!!   Cool thing is, it's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip or even Freemont. Located inside of a strip mall/restaurant area, its not hard to find. I jumped out of the car and almost ran inside. Fat life.  As soon as the waiter got to the table all I wanted to know was if I could get a menu with the sushi burgers. Ain't NOTHING ELSE TO TALK ABOUT!!!!!   However, lol, we ended up getting the sushi burrito, a couple of sushi rolls ANNNNNDDDDDDD *drum roll* A SUSHI BURGER. Namely \"The Karai\" which is spicy tuna, crab, salmon, cucumber, lettuce and screaming orgasm sauce in between a \"bun\" of deep fried rice patties! When I bit into it..... sweet Asian baby Jesus - AMAZING! Maybe it was the deep fried rice patties that were fried ever so golden brown. Perhaps it was the screaming orgasm sauce that definitely made my loins warm. It could've even been the salmon that tasted super fresh. Whatever it was, if I had the room in my belly, I would've tried ALL FOUR sushi burgers.   Yes there are FOUR!   I'm quite sure that getting wasted, gambling away your first born and then getting wasted again are ALL on your list for an epic Vegas trip, but it won't be complete without this place if you are a sushi lover and foodie!",

As a customer I know which times are best to go at because the first 2 times we went we hated the wait time. I do feel like during these busy times they should be fully staffed just because waiting 30 minutes for your appetizer to come is a little frustrating. We usually go during lunch and I've also been there for happy hour.   So, I'm giving this place 4 stars because the sushi is fresh, they have so many rolls to offer and they also have plenty veggie rolls, the price is just right, plus every time we're here, especially sitting at the bar, we have great convos with the sushi chefs.   The reason why I'm not giving this place a 5 star is solemnly because of the wait time during the busy hours but seriously this place is great and they most definitely have my business.",

The wait was just as long. We thought we beat the crowd as everyone else followed just a few minutes when we got there. Still, we had to wait an unexpected 20-30 minutes.   This is a sushi buffet which can cost up to $25 just for dinner. My girlfriend wanted to get an all you can eat thinking she'd finish everything but I was happy to have talked some senses into her. Instead, she opted for a salmon roll which only cost us $4! And vegetable tempura for $6! She couldn't even finish it with the additional $4 California roll that I got! Anyway, I'm more of the adventurous one so I got the sushi burger. I wanna say it's a lot like a sushi burrito which was a little heavy in the rice side. Also, it was a little messy to eat at the end but I used chopsticks for the rest.   The service is quick given how busy it was and the customer service was average.  Overall, it was a pleasant restaurant with cheap rolls at quality standards. I'd definitely come back here.",

We ordered from the different categories.  My favorites were the yuzu yellow tail, shrimp tempura, lemon pepper wings, and the monkey burrito.  The yuzu yellow tail was more of a palate cleanser for me because it was refreshing on the palate.  The lemon pepper wings were really crispy and just tasted so good.  I got the monkey burrito with no crab because im not a fan of imitation crab.  It was so good! I love the soy paper!!! It includes rice, daikon, tempura, and spicy tuna.  So crunchy!!!   At the end, if you do a yelp review you get a free dessert.  They ran out of the ice cream sandwich so they gave us melona.  The ayce also includes ice cream AND mochi ice cream.  Green tea ice cream is the way to go!!!!",

They also forgot to put in several items we ordered. After about 30 mins we asked where the items were and they said there was no order for them. They also suck at refilling drinks. We only got our iced tea refilled once and only because we asked for it. Don't think I'll come back here again just based on slow service and the fact that they forget to put in order for some of your items. Seemed like most the restaurant was mostly just waiting for food to come. We did have one server with glasses that was good but the rest were super inconsistent. Nothing special here unfortunately.",

Servers are very attentive to your every need and on point where we never had empty waters, beers, or sake as well as food! Great quality in sushi too for an AYCE place!

We originally went in for sushi burgers with friends, but hubby was the only one who didn't get burger and got regular sushi. I got the Karai (sorry misspelled?) sushi burger with the planko crusted rice. Wow!!!!! So I was very skeptical about trying a sushi burger, I was not disappointed. The only down side really is the size. It's huge and kind of hard to eat. Eating some of the fish and veggies with a chopstick first and then pressing the burger down a little seemed to help. Either way I am definitely going to be back to try the others!   My husband didn't like his sushi, it was falling apart. He got the Johnny Roll which every single piece fell apart. This is the cucumber wrapped roll with crab and shrimp tempura inside. Really good flavor, terrible presentation. The other roll he got I can't remember the name. Same thing, fell completely apart.   Service this time was the worst we have ever received. I mean I made eye contact and tried to flag the server down more than 5 times. He didn't once come check on us until maybe 10 minutes AFTER we ate our food. He didn't even bring it to us someone else did, he didn't even offer refills or anything like that. Our waiter was nowhere to be found while even though during a busy time the customers around us seemed to be getting faster and way friendly customer service. They were actually acknowledged. It took me over 15 min to order the second roll and it ended up being with a different server.   Overall food is good, I'd come for the sushi burgers or hibachi. I wouldn't come just for the regular sushi.",

    "text": "Stopped at Jjanga Friday for a work lunch with a group of coworkers... there were 9 of us in total. The restaurant is really cute - very trendy, several hibachi tables (but hibachi is only available for dinner), overall really nice looking. The hibachi area is separated from the regular tables by a divider thing. Overall, it's really nice.  For both lunch and dinner, they offer an all you can eat option for $20 for lunch or $25 for dinner. That's pretty cool! Only one person in our group ordered the AYCE option. I got a lunch special bento box and some tuna sushi. Everyone's sushi came out pretty quickly, but anything from the kitchen took AGES. Even to the point of someone who ordered 2 appetizers... their appetizers were the last things that came out. Last. At the end of the meal. My bento box came out a good 30-40 minutes after my sushi. One person never got their order of gyoza that they had ordered as part of their lunch sushi roll combo.   Aside from the slow service, they were just very nonchalant about our group. Waters with no refills. Parts of orders ignored. One person's appetizer was dry (the Dynamite, which is supposed to be creamy).   Overall, I'm just no impressed at all. The subpar service was not worth their automatic 20% gratuity added to groups. But I guess when you have a guaranteed gratuity, you don't care how awful the service is...",

But I was so wrong we were sat right away and our food was out so fast. The customer service was awesome too especially on such a busy night! My boyfriend got the ACE and I got a la carte. I got the crunch roll and it was amazing! I also got the mango mochi and they gave me two instead of one which was really nice! Loved the atmosphere here as well if was very clean and cozy! Will definitely be back!!",

Now, without spending the money for quality sashimi or nigiri, JJANGA is an affordable AYCE establishment.  This place will offer an elaborate menu for every palate (even offering Hibachi), unfortunately the service is sub par and lacks a welcoming ambience. Maybe it's partially due to the foot traffic or the idea that it is AYCE, JJANGA packs a punch for hungry patrons who enjoy rolls dressed in cream, but falls short on service as a sushi institution.",

It seems that they make up whatever time they want to close the grill side with absolutely no consistency, very disappointing!!! I want to continue to come here because as I mentioned before the food is good but im not down for the inconsistency. How do you close the grill at 1030 when the restaurant doesn't close until 2?",

We decided we had to sit at the bar since Chef was working tonight.  We sat down and ordered our drinks and appetizers.   After drinks and appetizers arrived we started ordering our Nigiri.  Nigiri came out and was delicious.  As we ordered, Chef Jjanga made jokes about some of the things we ordered like the Screaming O and the Salsa Salmon.  He also gave us couple things that were not on the menu.  He wouldn't tell us what it was but he told us just to eat it.  So we did, and it was great.  He also gave us a complimentary bottle of sake which we didn't mind.  When Chef was done, he introduced himself and thanked us for coming in.  What a great experience we had with great food and awesome service.  We will be back!",

The food was good so that's where the two stars are coming from, but service was absolutely horrible.  Our main waitress seemed to have no clue what was on the menu and just seemed overwhelmed in general.  My sister and I had ordered 4 items each and had to repeat what we had ordered to her multiple times. (Kinda seemed like she downed 4 redbulls before her shift.)  We were seated by the sushi bar and when our first round of food came out it wasn't what we ordered. The server would ask the sushi chef what the item was and flip to us and ask us if this was what we ordered 3-4 times until she got it right.   Our second round of food came out and it wasn't right either. She had given us a spicy scallop cut roll instead of a hand roll. She realized her mistake, but just replied \" Oh damn you ordered the hand roll huh? Oh don't worry though! They're the same price though. Don't worry.\" Thanks?   I also ordered a squid nigiri and a spicy salmon roll. Another waiter had come by, asking if we would like the check. I had mentioned my missing items and apparently they were never put in. As the look of confusion passes over the waiter's and the chef's face for a few moments. He says \"Oh! I'll put it in\" Our salmon roll came out, but we waited 20 minutes for the squid and just ended up asking for the check. Our original waitress came back and asked if we had wanted anything else and we asked about the squid and again the chef \"never got it\" Got the check, squid was on there, asked them to remove it, paid and left.  This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, but If you enjoy sh*tty service with mildly rude waitresses, JJANGA is the place for you!",

Once we got closer we saw a small sign on the door that stated JJanga. We both had the AYCE, and it didn't disappoint. Everything was so yummy and perfectly explained and separated so if you know what you like, you don't have to search the menu for hours.

    "text": "Came here when there were barely any customers. 'Barely any customers' meaning a few people at the bar and one party of 2 people in the whole restaurant. I was with 4 of my friends and 2 kids. Took like 5 minutes to get seated. We ordered drinks right away and took a few minutes to look over the menu.. it felt like our server (he never told us his name.. he was white and had earrings) took a long to come back and take our order. Which I did not understand at all since it wasn't even busy at the moment.. we all ordered a couple things and did a split bill.  So here we are, hanging out and talking while waiting on our food.. and the longer we waited we are all realizing that food is taking forever to come out. Like.. 45 mins waiting and so far we got all of our sushi rolls, which were made very sloppy.. and sushi burritos. An hour pass by and we still have not received the 3 sushi burgers, and our other small plates.. teriyaki chicken, KFC, fried rice, and fries. Our server never really came to check up on us like they would normally do in other places. We had to find somebody and stop them to ask about the rest of our orders because it was taking forever. Then after asking that person, our server came by and we also stopped and asked him about it too. It was insane how long it took them to get the rest of our orders out. Eventually we did end up getting all our food. But the wait killed it for us.  Food was OK. Not worth a long wait. Not sure how it is when they're busy but hopefully they aren't as slow as they were today lol.  Also, when we were ready to leave, our server yet again never came around to give us our check.. by how empty our plates were, you'd think somebody would be by to clear up the table and our server would come by and try to do his job.. Instead, he decided to go on a break. We all saw our server sitting at the bar laughing and talking with his friends. Didn't care to mention he would be going on a break to our table. So here we are again, looking for somebody working there to ask for our check.. I asked another server who just happened to be helping a new group of people who just walked in and he seriously asked me and my friends what we all ordered in order to get our checks. That is ridiculous. I told him that his coworker should already have our orders. So he went to the computer and printed our checks. We waited a little while hoping for that server to come back and process our payments since our own server was still sitting at the bar.. but it seemed like he just kept walking to the back room all the time. So I got up out of my chair because we were sick of the long wait and I went to see Susan who was the only employee nearby (I only know her name because it was on our receipt, I wish it had our real servers name on it though). She was really nice and apologized that we had to wait so long. Thank you, Susan.   With our overall experience at this restaurant, we will not be returning.",

They bring it just as hard as their OG Spring Mountain location, consistently delivering fresh and delicious sushi with top notch service.  We've been twice and the wait time was minimal to non-existent.  They're located adjacent from DW Bistro in the same shopping plaza.",

Specially Jjanga himeself, I've known him for awhile now and he's really great Sushiman/Business man. He knows what he's doing. I can't wait to see his 3rd Location...Hopefully somewhere in North or something lol His staffs are really nice,kind,fun and friendly.  I love Ellen who works there too. She makes the best Gummy Bear Shots. I enjoy her Shots all the time and if you like sweet drink..you HAVE to try her Gummy Bear Shots. Really fun to take the shots with Gummy bear inside and it is so yummy! I love Jjanga's Old location too but I like the Second Location for Steak and Sushi. I'll say the Best AYCE Sushi place in Town! Must try!!!",

He was good as far as preparing our dinners everything was Cook like we asked & was very flavorful & He was very professional too no complaints there what so ever just needed a little bit more spunk & flare to the meal! Also wanted to point out & my wife didnt notice but the Cook also knew the family we sat with I guess the frequented JJANGA but the gentlemen with the family and I ordered the JJANGA special & it seemed like his portions were a bit bigger than my own. Servers where on top of things as well no complaints there either. Idk just wanted my wife's 1st time to be a bit more exciting & lively than it was like hibachi experiences I've had in the past! Would definitely come back again see if we get a better show cuz IMO that s what hibachi is all bout & of course the food.",

We had decided to go with Al A Carte after seeing the menu was not badly priced! $7 sushi burritos and $4 classic rolls which are perfect for me since I am pregnant and can't eat raw fish. When we received 3 sets of 8pc. classic rolls, they were as basic as it gets. They were cut really thin to make it an 8pc sushi roll. I guess that's why it's $4. One of the rolls placed on the table was the wrong roll, the server noticed that she said the wrong name but then still assured us it was the correct roll. It didn't have any sauce and was def not the roll we ordered. My husbands sushi burrito arrived first and wow it looked good. It was decent sized and came with a side of spicy mayo and eel sauce, he did enjoy it. Shortly after mine was brought to the table and literally was half the size of his and did not come with the eel sauce it was suppose to. It tasted good but I realized it was also missing broccoli tempura like the menu said it came with. Overall it was a sad and disappointing experience and we most likely aren't coming back here since there are many other better sushi places out there. Service was okay, and restaurant was nice though.",

    "text": "BEST AYCE SO FAR  My big sis told us about the grand opening for the fort apache location so we went on jan. 31st & there were 6 of us and it was for AYCE! The decor of this location was PRETTY! Very open spaced & high ceilings & it felt elegant & nice for an AYCE dining experience.   We got to meet the owner JJANGA & he was also one of the sushi chefs! All the staff was very friendly & all very helpful. All of the sushi that we ordered came out very quickly and although they were out of UNI then I guess it just shows how fresh things are. Becuase they also ended up running out of halibut as well ahahha They definately accommodated us well becuase they allowed us to order more beef tataki  in place of the uni.  The only concern was the hot foods came out a little bit warm rather than hott but we assume those are just some kinks that will be worked out in the future  Definately can't wait to try the habachi side of the restaurant! Till then I will definately come back and leave my thoughts for that part of the resteraunt!",

Ordered one of the sushi burgers that looked so good, the Jjanga and Kanai sushi burger. Wasn't a long wait for it to be made. We ordered the combo which came with fries and a soda of choice. The burger was a 7 or 8 out of 10 for me. Definitely filling off of just the burger, and I was starving. Here's my downside: we never got our order of fries and we were never served or checked up on by any one of the servers the entire time we ate. The only time we did was when they served our drinks and our sushi burger once we sat down and ordered. We had to stop a server serving other customers at the table next to us to check up on our fries, and she said she would, but walked the opposite way of the kitchen and actually never came back,  lol. It wasn't until one server came and noticed us sitting there waiting, and we asked for our check and told her about our fries, but we were over it. They didn't charge us for the combo, just the sushi burger itself which was like $9 ($3 added for combo), which should be the case anyways, and gave us these melon popsicles to say sorry. She was sweet and nice and said sorry tho! So overall, probably bc it was busy, but seriously, not once didn't anyone check up on us for the hour or so we were there? 3/5 stars bc of the service!",

I doubt I would eat here again with sushi mon and sushi koma near by, there's just no point.  it might be better to visit before the rush hour for dinner, maybe service and time frames won't lack, I'm not sure.",

    "text": "Upon entry we were immediately greeted by a friendly and welcoming lady. Husband and I NEVER sit at the bar. He always wants to, but, I don't like it. I don't like bothering someone with our order when I can clearly see them rolling away and looking all ready busy. I prefer ordering when a waitress comes and takes our order. Taught my husband a lesson that evening.  So we sat at the bar. I'm immediately looking for purse space. This must sound high maintenance all ready, but seriously...I will use my purse as a back cushion before it sits on the floor. Bad luck! Superstitious much? Once I assessed the purse situation, let's stare at the menu  I sure loved looking at their menu and what they has to offer. We opted for AYCE because what sushi person in their right mind go otherwise. Lunch rounded to 21 bucks while dinner rounds to 26. The price is WELL WORTH it! I noticed they offered sushi burritos as part of their AYCE, but it's listed under hand rolls. Which is basically the same smell.  We ordered away. My husband lucks out with me because you know those special 1 order person items sushi places implements, I never like or order any of them anyway so he gets 2! Lol. He was extremely excited over seeing Tobiko served on the menu. The color is so beautifully red that it makes masago look real dull. He just loves trying new things even though they may taste the same.   I enjoyed all that I had. Please.dont make me list my AYCE order. Who the hell remembers to the T anyway? What I do know is that there were a couple.items I ordered towards the end that I thought were useless. I ate them, and nothing exciting came of it. I think they're place there just to make you disgustingly feel full. Hahhaha! Because they were my last 2 orders and they made me feel just that. I tried looking at the online menu but for some reason, their menu in the restaurant vs online could slightly be different as I didn't see it nor recognize any of the items being the items I ate that made me feel like a slob.  Another thing is I LOVE garlic edamame. Love it. Like, no, really love it. However, I did not love it here, did not <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flike.it&s=78add022043d8572c942c80d12d0de0e905894d793f7ae85f9d78bbb2215d9da\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">like.it</a> there, swear I swear I swear.   Also, we were seated in front of two chefs and while the guy was really friendly and welcoming, the woman chef made me feel like she was annoyed and never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything. So we ended up staring at the friendlier chef like hungry puppies until he caught the drift. Lol. My husband became really timid when it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcame.to&s=6378153cc19f0ecd5a1e7c7f0cfe53680e2295324481deadee09ba84baa47071\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">came.to</a>.ordering because he was seated adjacent to the woman and he didn't really order as much as he wanted because of the vibe. BUT...he still got what he came for.   Another annoying thing is...plates for other patrons were places right in front of us so the waiters/waitresses had to keep reach in front of us. It's rather an inconvenience and borderline annoying. They should create a system where they don't have to do that. Why I hate sitting at the bar.   If your stomach can't handle or it isn't worth you opting for the AYCE...they do have great soup/salad, appetizer, and nigiri options at a pretty cheap price and selection in my opinion. I imagined bringing my children in and just ordering from the appetizers alone and they'd be covered.   Overall, I highly recommend giving them a shot. They're pretty good and I love their menu options! Kid and stroller friendly! Certainly will return...waitress/waiter please?!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Oh my goodness! Can I give more stars to this place? I love sushi and I'm always trying to try new sushi places at home or when I travel. Today I stumbled upon this gem and wow was I blown away. Very pleasant waiter Alex greeted us and we chose the all you can eat sushi during lunch. First thing we noticed was the vast menu so we asked Alex what his favorite was and he suggested the monkey sushi burrito. Wow! First bite and I knew: this place is on another level. We proceeded to try random items on the menu we thought sounded good and every time something else came we enjoyed it more and more. Wound up picking the bulgogi appetizer, monkey burrito, 6 different sushi rolls, and a Korean ice cream sandwich. Holy moly what a joy to eat here! The quality is phenomenal, the service is good, and the flavor... Oh my! My all time favorite sushi rolls were the XXX and the screaming honey. It's really impressive to me especially that we practically dart boarded on their menu things we thought sounded good and everything was so highly satisfying. We had actually planned initially to come here once so we had a chance to try more places during our vacation here but nope. Definitely coming again and this time for dinner!   I'm very interested in trying the beef/steak options that are only available during dinner. You can choose anything on the menu with black font can be chosen for lunch but the red font can only be selected during dinner. However, about 85 - 90% of the menu was in black font so you don't have to worry.",

    "text": "First time visiting here from the Bay (represent!) after seeing all the rave about the sushi burger on Facebook haha  My friends & I got:  - Jjanga Burger - Jjanga Burrito - Sexy Time Sushi - Stacey's Mom Sushi - Sponge Special Sushi - KFC   The Jjanga burger was decent, though a little more bland than I'd expect. We got the rice bun instead of the panko bun, which is probably why it started falling apart after a few bites. Other than that, I would still try the other burgers though! Maybe the Jjanga wasn't for us.   The Jjanga burrito however, was pretty good! It comes with the sweet eel sauce which goes well with the burrito. Definitely wanna try the other burritos next time I'm in town!   We loved all the sushi rolls - especially their racy and pop-culture-inspired names! Wanted to order more but after sharing the dishes family-style, we got full pretty quick.   First time I've ever tried the KFC (Korean-Fried Chicken) and it was really good! I would have definitely ordered more had we not gotten so full.  All-in-all, great place to eat with reasonable prices & portion sizes. Would definitely recommend a visit here - not just for the sushi burger, but for their other food too!  PS: Our waiter was Alex and he was the best! Super patient with our indecisiveness on what to order and funny too!",

I personally love the yuzu yellowtail (omg such a refreshing taste) and the garlic tuna which, unlike other places, doesn't have a big wad of garlic on top of it but rather seems to infuse the garlic flavor into the sauce that they put on top and it's fantastic. Tons of garlic flavor but it doesnt get stuck in your teeth lol.   The service is great, all the staff i've encountered have been friendly and they're always on their feet keeping busy. WHICH IS WHY i've been able to overlook the fact that i feel service is kind of slow. Not unbearably slow.. but slower i feel than other sushi places.   Still, the service is great, restaurant and restroom clean, and the sushi is delicious. I'll keep coming back. And do yourself a favor and order the hot salmon skin hand roll. Just a touch of spice on the crispy skin. Not drenched in sauce and they put avocado in it and i dont think i've had a salmon skin roll that had that. I'd come back for that alone!",

We ordered the sushi burgers. They looked small in pictures but these were actually pretty humongous. I thought they were slider size but it's actually big burger size. I did not get the prank crusted one because i didn't want that extra oil but the Hubby did. He actually ate it pretty fast. I actually started using chopstick because it started falling apart. It was actually pretty cheap for the combo which comes with fries and a drink. I will most likely be back.",

My boyfriend and I discovered this place because we were craving sushi late at night and saw that they were still open! So glad we stumbled upon this place.   They have such a wide selection of items, from sushi rolls, to sushi burritos, to Korean fried chicken, appetizer sized bulgogi, baby octopus and so much more! I would definitely recommend coming here and trying this place out. It will quickly become a favorite.   I would have posted pictures but I was too hungry to wait",

Positive - The restaurant location is in a nice area in Las Vegas - The chocolate ice cream was from Thrifty and it was very yummy.  - Johnny Roll - delicious   Negative (reason for my 1 star) - Seating was not great, we sat on these hard boxes. Very difficulty getting in and getting out.  - Services was not great, service kept forgetting our order & we had to reminder her a couple of times.  - Make sure you child does not read the sushi menu, they have some non kid friendly names on them. Example: Crazy Ass, Sexy Time, Tree Some Special, I love my Ass, Burning your Ass & Taste like my X girlfriend.  - I do not recommend the following  *Baked Salmon Roll - very dry & no flavor  *Udon soup - smells & tasted too fishy  *Tree Some Special - way too much cream cheese *W07 - Not a fan of the ginger sauce  *Sun Devil - over deep fried  *Baked Mussel - Not good a all   I did hear they have 2 locations so maybe I'll try the other location one day.",

My one complaint is that the chairs if you could call them that are probably the most uncomfortable thing you could sit on. The chairs are literally square plywood boxes. The only thing I can think is that they make the chairs are uncomfortable on purpose so that you don't stick around to long and keep eating (all you can eat sushi after all). We sat at a table in the center of the restaurant. Maybe the seating is different at some of their other tables.",

    "text": "I'm hoping tonight was just a very (very) off night due to how busy the restaurant was... The food was - as it was the last time I was here - pretty good, but the service was completely horrendous.  My sister and I ordered 9 items a la carte, 8 of which were ordered at the beginning of the meal. Of the 8 that we initially ordered, the waitress that took our order screwed up 1 of the items (twice) and somehow forgot to write down 2 items completely. How anybody is capable of doing this with an 8 item order at a sushi restaurant (especially after asking the customer to repeat each item and then repeating the order back to the customer to confirm) is completely beyond me.  When she brought out the first plate, she realized something was off, put it on the table anyways and immediately picked it up again. She then asked me to confirm that it wasn't what I ordered. For the next minute, she asked me 3 times to tell her the item that I did order.  When this item (a spicy scallop hand roll) finally came out, it wasn't a hand roll... but a cut roll. She put it down, said \"You ordered a hand roll, didn't you...\" I confirmed, and instead of offering to correct her mistake or apologizing, she said \"Don't worry, it's the same price.\"  At this point, meh... I was still in a good mood and just chalked it up to how full the place was, the fact that it's a Saturday night so who actually wants to be working, etc etc. After getting 7 items and waiting for a bit for the last two though, a waiter walks by and asks if we're ready for the check. We tell him there should be another 2 coming out (a spicy salmon cut roll and a squid nigiri), so he checks with the sushi chefs, comes back and tells us they don't have record of those orders. So fine, we confirm that we still do want those 2 items and he puts in the order.  After getting the roll, we waited a bit and then asked our original waitress to check on our squid. She checks with the sushi chef and says no, they don't have that order. At this point, we're just ready to go so we ask for the check, which - surprise, surprise - has the squid nigiri that 2 people have now told us we didn't order.  I'm not prone to writing excessively long reviews, but the sheer amount of f*uck ups (for lack of a better word) and the fact that nobody really apologized kinda bugs me.  Needless to say, I won't be back. Food is decent, but that can be said for a lot of places around town - most of which *might* even get your order right the first (or second) time around or at least boast a higher than 67% order accuracy rate.",

One can literally get full on appetizers alone.. Baby octopus, shumai, garlic edamame & gyoza just to name a few. For AYCE its pretty inexpensive and you definitely have a lot to choose from. No matter lunch or dinner we always opt for dinner, we love their oysters and beef tataki which are limited to one order per person. We've out smarted the system and order the red bull roll which has beef tataki across the whole roll, its one of our favorites.  The only con is that they don't do half orders. But as long as you go with a partner you can always share and try more rolls that way.",

    "text": "First time trying sushi in Vegas... Because who eats raw fish in the desert? Very little wait to get a seat and had our drink infront of us in no time at all. Now here's where things get weirder than eating sushi in the desert. They have sushi burgers! This must be the new hip trend after sushi burritos. Everyone and their mother (yes there were mostly families around me) were ordering one. Other than it not being part of the AYCE, the Jjanga burger was sweet. I will be returning.",

    "text": "I saw their sushi burger on Yelp's Instagram page and NEEDED to try this place! I never knew such a thing existed. I was definitely pleased with my Karai burger filled with spicy ahi, salmon, and imitation crab. Whatever the sauce was, it was so flavorful! I really like the twist on the bun--it was crisped rice that reminded me of hash browns. $10 is such a good deal for a burger that huge and filling. My other friends had the AYCE sushi which they also loved. There is such a wide selection of food to choose from on both the front and back of the menu. It's also good that they don't load the rice onto the sushi so that you purposely get full faster (like some other restaurants I know). The menu definitely has some interesting names for some of their items like \"Taste my ex girlfriend\" which I thought was both hilarious and odd. Yes, worth $21 for AYCE. Sorry my picture doesn't do this place justice. I highly recommend this restaurant!!",

He introduced me to a CA sauvignon blanc that was actually amazing,  even showed me the bottle when I asked more questions about it. Super friendly staff, our Tepanyaki (sp?) Chef was attentive (joe?), asked how we liked things cooked and seasoned and the atmosphere was relaxing, except for the screaming child next to us but she was just happy and enjoying her time with her family so it didn't bother us at all. Give this place a try if you like what the menu has to offer. The entire staff seemed to genuinely like it there, my bf and I are in the business so we know what it is to have great service and great food, you need both to have happy Guests and we definitely were.",

Customer service was pretty good. Everyone kept on checking on us but my water was completely empty before anyone noticed that I needed a refill. We might just stick to our go to at Sushi House Goyemon for AYCE sushi. We will be back though because the other side of Jjanga is the hibachi grill which we'll have to try.",

Since I have not had a chance to try it yet. Upon trying it, I will definitely update my review.

The quality of the fish itself was top-notch. And the flavors of each sushi burger were beautifully executed.  I would come back to Vegas in a heartbeat to eat some more sushi burgers!!!",

Its not the best quality sushi but compared to a few other AYCE sushi places on the upper end of it. You get what you pay for after all so dont expect japanese imports!   Unfortunately there was one roll that had caused me some stomach problems almost immediately after i ate it so i will not be able to give such a stellar review. I cited the problem to some of the staff and although one was a bit difficult (may be due to some people complaining to get lesser prices) it was fixed a bit after by another of the staff who made sure that our time wasn't too bad and a bit more pleasant, i will likely be coming back to give it a try again because of him.",

    "text": "Oh my gosh, imagine my surprise when I found an affordable, delicious, practically gourmet-quality (imho) sushi place in Las Vegas! I'm so accustomed to this city being flooded with overpriced cuisine that focuses even more on presentation than they do the taste of their food.  Jjanga has a great balance of both. And just a warning, their other location does not have their sushi burgers/sandwiches! We went there first but then left quickly to check out this location.  The restaurant is pretty spacious, and the variety on the menu is vast. I had seen their sushi burgers/sandwiches on Instagram, and couldn't wait to give them a try. Heck with my vegetarianism! I'm flexible for special occasions.   I got their main Jjanga sushi sandwich with panko crumbs, which I can't seem to find on any of their online menus. It was fantastic! However, I didn't realize that having the panko crumbs meant it would be fried - well duh! It was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and it was huge for just $9 I believe. I could only finish half, but finished the rest that night for dinner.   We also enjoyed some sake bombs, and my husband loved all the various rolls he ordered. Next time we come to Vegas, this will be our first stop for food.",

When we arrived around 5:30p it wasn't too busy, we signed in because we didn't have a reservation, and we sat for maybe 5min.   Once we were seated, the server got our drinks right away, and we were ready to order.   We each had 2 rolls each. I can't remember what they were though. Overall, the sushi was good, but it was just like any other sushi place. Nothing too special.   I removed 2 stars because the service lacked when they got busy at around 6ish. I had asked for another roll, and it took them 30min, literally, 30min for me to finally receive it. My wife was about to say something because she was waiting to eat her roll until my got to the table.   With service like that, it really changed our mind about that place. We understood it got a tad busy, but make sure there's enough staff to accommodate then, especially on a Saturday night.   Would we go here again? Probably not.",

Then we hear the staff behind us talk about how they wanted to go home and that we should leave immediately. They didnt close until 2AM. Ordered various items of nigiri and one Cali on top roll. The roll was pretty good but nigiri came with too much rice and it was extremely vinegary that my tongue was stinging a bit. Completely overwhelmed the taste of the actual fish. We also ordered Uni, my favorite, and it tasted like dish soap. Didnt order much and couldnt get my $26 AYCE worth. Good mochi tho? Definitely not coming back here. Umiya is way 1000 times better.",

The menu is quite extensive, and everything on the menu is included with the AYCE; however, there are some items marked in red, which means only one order of that item is allowed per person.  The fish was good for AYCE sushi.  The wait staff comes often enough to ask if you would like more.  The policy written on the menu states that people will be charged for food not eaten so it's best to order a little at a time.  Of course, our first order was a good amount, but then each subsequent request only was what we were sure we could finish.  After placing an order, the sushi comes pretty quickly.  I would return to eat here again.",

It was huge.  I couldn't capture the same burger they have on their IG page but it was huge and good.  Very different.  Pictures of the salmon burger showed more salmon in it, but when I got mine, it seem like I had a spicy tuna burger.  The salmon was in the burger but I found it in the middle. Overall it was a 3/5 stars.  Like a roll just with the goodness between Panko rice buns.  I would still like to try the other burgers.   In general, I like Jjangas menu because I've been to their sister restaurant so I'm a fan already.",

It was just the 2 of us and the place was pretty empty so we were seated right away. I would say there were maybe 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. The waiter came up after 5 minutes and took our order and drink order. We only ordered 2 Kirin Light beers. But we did order a bunch of sushi.   The waiter came back with some water and then he turned around and started giving us our sushi from the sushi bar. We ordered around 10 items and they pretty much came all at once. That is fine but where is our beer???  The waiter never came back-- I had to get another waitress to come by, I asked her where our beers were. It didn't really matter at this point because we had already finished out entire meal. I mean the restaurant was not busy and they could not serve us 2 beers? That's a problem.   The fish was not fresh at all and the pieces were so small. I have never seen pieces this small before. It was very strange. I have been to many AYCE sushi places and I was also surprised that they did not put avocado in the rolls. They either left it out or put carrots.   When we finally got the bill they ended up charging us for the 2 beers. I thought it was kind of rude to do that since they didn't even bring them until we were finished with our meal. The whole point was to enjoy the beer while eating the sushi. Overall I was not impressed with this place and will probably not come back. I like my sushi to be fresh and I didn't get that here.",

After flight being delayed 2 hours and not arriving till 10 I was starving. I found this late night sushi spot on yelp with amazing reviews and interesting food. Took an Uber and arrived about 11:30 pm right before their late night rush I guess. I was promptly seated but after being seated it went all down hill.   A waiter who I never saw again took my initial order and I asked to keep the menu so I could see what else I wanted. 15 min later and not even appetizer or the man coming back to see if i wanted to add to my order.  20 min in, I watched newly seated people, with groups ranging from 2-4 people get their food first! I'm here at 12am, visiting Vegas, alone and I'm being ignored.   A man finally came and asked me if I needed anything or was waiting and I told him what I was waiting on and how I wanted to add something .   I gusss my other waiter got off and just forgot about me all entirely . Once I recited my sushi burrito 40 min into my dining experience. I devoured it! And don't get me wrong, it was good.. but hey where Is my appetizer ... where is my bulgogi.. wheee is my sushi roll?     My new waiter apologized and checked - I guess they lost my sushi roll order and so I had them cancel. The bulgogi was meh, nothing special. I don't even remember the appetizer I ordered because the dinning experience it self just bugged the hell out of me.   Great prices, decent food I'm sure and trash service .   I'll stick to eating on the strip next time and saving a $20 uber ride",

The chefs are amazing, and on my last visit, they went out of their way to make a special dish for me! It was so beautiful I almost felt bad eating it! I rave about this place to everybody I know and tell them they must visit whenever they're in Las Vegas- that's how much i love it! Thank you Jjanga restaurant & staff, you guys are wonderful!",

It was lunch time and we sat down, I waited a good 10 minutes for my first order which was only: miso soup & fried fish. Had to wait another 6-7 minutes to order more food (I ordered AYCE). I'm waiting 20 minutes for food! I finally waived at the server to ask for the check and he tells me upon giving me the check that health inspection came in and they couldn't make anymore food. I understand, and that's fine, since I know the health department does random check ins, but where is the COMMUNICATION with your customers?!? They made me wait 30 mins. Sigh, so sad my first time had to be like this. Def probably will never come back, so many other sushi/hibachi places with better staff.   *update*  The manager did comp our next dinner here. The service was great and food came out yummy! Whenever I am on that side of town I will definitely be back. Thank you!",

They break the menus down in sections such as , spicy, shrimp, firs, etc. it really helps when deciding what you want. When they say spicy they really mean spicy! their rolls were tiny which was good because if you don't finish it you have to it for it. They even have a hibachi section. Their rolls come out fast!

Everything I ordered was super fresh! Next time I gotta try the sushi burger it looks incredible! The restaurant was very clean and just a wonderful environment. The only thing I didn't like was the wait... I was told 15 mins but ended up waiting about 30-45 mins which would be understandable IF they were busy.

So if you are extra sensitive to particulates in the air and somewhat smokey odors, you might have an uncomfortable time breathing here.  The fish quality is satisfyingly good here, but the preparation/presentation is a tragedy. The nigiri here would make Jiro Ono's head explode.   So, their sushi is ugly, but still a place worth checking out.",

The downfall is that you do not hey everything you order in a timely manner. We waited 30 minutes for edamame, got food we ordered after we got desserts because they forgot about it and had servers continuously asking us if we wanted food before our orders even came. We also wanted to order some desserts and they limited our party even after not serving us everything we ordered or even in a timely manner.",

They have one of the biggest vegetable sections that I've seen at a sushi place and they are incredible! From edamame hand rolls to vegetable sushi burritos. Not only is there a large selection, but they are delicious. I must have eaten four of the April Rolls alone.   The service is great, the food is incredible and the all you can eat for about $20 is great!",

They survived naruto roll in hot dish and cucumber was saggy and almost cooked it tasted so bad and they put so less fish you can see in the pic. I complained about sushi and roll but they ignore like nothing. We went there after couple of month now never going back. There are so many good sushi restaurant in town.",

I've had the Teppanyaki grill, and it's ok. They have less expensive prices than other places and I understand this place is more of a budget place so more people can enjoy sushi and teppanyaki. This place is good. I mostly do take out. Makes a good after work take home place. Price is great. Food is good.",

I have to say that almost every dish was spot on and well seasoned. There were just a few minor things I would do to improve anything!

    "text": "It's probably needless to write a review for 4 star Jjanga. The large crowd last night entices me to limit any further exposure, but having eaten my body weight in sushi over multiple visits, I have to throw my 2 chopsticks in. Best service of any sushi restaurant in town! The hosts and staff go out of their way to accommodate with a smile and great attitude. There is a sushi section and teppanyaki/hibachi section. Atmosphere: High Energy club-like vibe ALL YOU CAN EAT. This is the only way we do sushi...why limit yourself to a la carte when you can unlock the entire menu for $25.95 (dinner 3pm-2am) or $20.95 (lunch 11:30-3pm) Get a carafe of GRAPEFRUIT INFUSED SAKE to share, you might even want 2. Refreshing, cold with citrus accents and the perfect way to start your night or compliment your sushi. Sushi: our friend said it best when describing the freshness...\"I know it's fresh when you can't tell the kind of fish, it just melts in your mouth.\" That is how good Jjanga's sushi is. FAVORITES: Something Special: calamari tempura, crab wrapped in cucumber topped with eel sauce. Light and doesn't fill you up with rice. Ask for RAYU sauce...sesame, chili infused oil...dip everything in it...especially the Garlic Tuna. You're welcome. The Cheese Croquettes are a must try. Crispy warm fried cheese topped with a creamy sauce. Don't knock it til you try it...it surprised us. Something Wrong 69: A roll where one side starts with salmon and ends on tuna with shrimp tempura on both ends. Did I mention the RAYU sauce? Love that stuff. Oysters: fresh and perfect for shooting. (Limit one per AYCE guest) Screaming Orgasm: delicious but needed more sauce. (Limit one per AYCE guest) Bulgogi : this is the only sushi place that I know who has sizzling Bulgogi on a fajita plate...awesome! To finish your meal, you have to leave room for the Chocolate Malted Crunch Ice Cream. They freakin have Thrifty's ice cream for dessert! This is now our sushi place. I'd appreciate it if you didn't come here on Saturday nights :)",

I've told many friends and family about this place and will continue to be a loyal customer.  Annie and Antonio our servers were also very nice.  We will be back for more!!!  :-)",

We are always greeted with enthusiasm and a smile and it stays that way throughout the night.   Originally, we decided to try to place on the fact that it was open and it was close to my house. The second time we chose it because of the service, quality of the sushi, and the happy hour that starts at 11pm-1pm. They give you lunch AYCE pricing instead of dinner for those couple of hours. Also, just a small fact- you can get classic rolls (8 pieces) for only 3.00 without AYCE.   Everything we get is delicious. Not bland, boring, etc. So worth it. We will be coming back for more.",

There are a lot of sushi places esp AYCE at Las Vegas and to me it all boils down to the menu and customer service.  1. Servers are on point, always refilled our drink. 2. Ambiance was good and played alot of musical variety 3. I love how there are huge posters of the chefs, made me feel I was at a IronChef studio Lol 4. The overall staff had a good vibe, it seemed like they love to work there, like what theyre doing and always attentive to our orders.  Moving on with our food...  1. I like the rice portion, its not too much.. 2. They have freshest oyster you could ever had a Las Vegas 3. The food portions are perfect. 4. Food came out fast during dinner service. 5. The best garlic tuna  I wish they also have hamachi kama and soft shell crab that will make my rating over 5 stars Lol. But other than that, I will surely come back as this restaurant is very close to my house.",

The age for all you can eat sushi changes depending on your server and if you do order all you can eat it's as if they intentionally make you wait for a long time between orders so you fill up early.  Kaya sushi is the best all you can eat in town. Jjanga is worth missing unless you're doing take out.",

    "text": "After hearing so much good things about this restaurant, we decided to celebrate our daughter's 8th Birthday here. It was a Friday evening, so a bit busy on the AYCE sushi side.   Upon arrival we were greeted. Nice atmosphere, music a bit loud. Other than that, it's a good place. I would have liked to give this restaurant 4 stars, because really our food was tasty and our chef was the bomb.   The cons. We waited about 20 minutes for our dinner to even begin, which we had our kids ages 18, 16, our 8 year old Birthday girl and our toddler son who is 2. Try telling your young ones, the food will be coming shortly or even our appetizers, which never came until we asked about it. By this time our entrees were being cooked, but our son had fell asleep before he could even eat anything. Our waitress never came by to refill our drinks or even ask if we needed anything or asked if we were ok. Pisses me off I had to leave a tip for such bad service, but our chef Joshua did an outstanding job with our food, that we decided to tip 16% If he hadn't made us laugh and did an awesome job, I would have left a $5 tip and a piece of my mind on that receipt.   Management needs to talk to staff and make sure their employees are well trained. Our waitress passed us by a handful of times, never once asking if we were good. There's no excuse to be treated this way. She was later relaxing with others by the bar. To me, this is totally unprofessional. If you're done with work, LEAVE. I could be opinionated, because the fact that we spent so much and still left a tip, makes me so angry. This wasn't our first choice, but since so much friends highly recommended it and it's 5 minutes from our place, we decided to give it a try. Not sure if we'd give this place another try, but the food is good and Chef Joshua or Blaze (same guy) was awesome. For us or I speak for myself, first impressions of a food establishment say a lot. Too bad our first experience here, wasn't as great as our friends. Hands down to the waitress that picked up our waitresses slack tho.",

The only catch is they have to use a clean knife and cutting board, so I always let them know when I order and order my rolls all at once in the beginning so I'm out of the way. This time they said they couldn't wash a knife and cutting board for me so they couldn't serve me. I explained we have been coming here for years frequently and it has never a problem. They said they were sorry but the chef wouldn't serve me. I'm also 5 months pregnant, so despite the allergy I couldn't risk cross contamination due to food poisoning risk to the baby. So if you are vegetarian or vegan, that means you will have fish on your veggie rolls too since they won't clean between making other types of rolls. Unfortunately we can never go back. We are very disappointed.",

    "text": "This location is one of my sushi heavens!  They have a variety of sushis to choose from and a good amount of appitizers to pair with your sushi rolls.  You can't go wrong with their all you can eat with is really priced affortably.  Lunch is till 3PM for about $20 and dinner after 3PM for about $25.  The atmosphere is relaxing,  nothing too fancy, but just a comfortable place to be.  The tables are spaced out perfectly considering how big you will feel after eating way more than you should have lol.  They have the tempenyaki grills at night which I still need to try. They have the usual dessert of assorted ice cream and mochi ice cream.  Here's a little tip,  there is a small blackboard at the bar with specials, check it out for any special dessert.  They usually have the melona bars that aren't on the menu.  But ask for one and if they have any you score!  I would have given them a 5 star but the service was really slow to the point you are questioning your self and are pretty sure you put your order in.  And a few times they brought us someone else's order and took our orders to other tables.  But other than today this place is awesome and usually give great service.",

They have a fantastic assortment of non-seafood options on their AYCE menu that we both enjoyed. Everything was absolutely delicious. The only reason for 4 stars is because of service. Our server could have been more present; we waited too long in between courses to order. The upside was the attentiveness of the other servers in the area who made sure our drinks were refilled in a timely manner and brought our food out. Overall it was a good experience and I'm looking forward to going back soon!",

The food is delicious, but sometimes it can get a little busy depending on the day (they are that good). It can be hard if you have large parties to get serviced quickly so please keep that in mind, the staff there do their best. The only reason I am doing 4/5 stars is because my order was incorrect or forgotten a few times and I did have to remind them. But again, they were at a busy time so I understand that too. Let's talk food. If you like AYCE or Hibachi this is definitely the place to be. They have amazing sushi burritos (Monkey and Superman are tasty). Oh and if you like spicy rolls try out the XXX and Red Rock rolls. Overall the sushi, hibachi, and desserts were really good. For the desserts, the green tea mochi was really good. If you are doing the Hibachi, the Jjanga special is a good portion and has an amazing combination of meats.",

Imagine a fry cook at Denny's and he's your chef .. no-show no pizzazz just cooking your dinner and serving it to you and that's about it. And with that it wasn't even a good job. When you go to a Japanese steakhouse , you want the experience and when you bring guests who have never been to one you want them to really have the experience. There was no experience ,, none .

Even more intriguing was the fact that he had taken over Kanji restaurant, which was known for it's teppanyaki. A group of us headed over to check out his new place recently, and suffice to say, it's all good... in the hood!  Jjanga is located on the west side over near Fort Apache and Warm Springs. They have taken over the space that was formerly known as Kanji Steak and Sushi. But, they have retained the teppanyaki at this location, so even if you are not in the mood for sushi, you can get your onion volcano fix here. The interior is definitely very cool and classy. It's probably one of the more upscale sushi spots here in town. If you do go the teppan route, that side of the restaurant is very fun and exciting.  But oh, let me talk to you about the sushi, because it is something that you should definitely not miss out on. Jjanga (and also a different restaurant) is in my top two favorite ayce sushi spots in Vegas. He uses a lot of fresher product than most other places, and he would not be willing to send out anything that isn't up to his standards. The cuts of fish used on the nigiri are thick, and the rice portions are small. That's a big plus for me. And, the rice is cooked really well here. I'm not personally a big fan of rolls, but Jjanga does make some good ones. My group ordered some, and I was able to sample a few, and in conclusion, they were really good, with all the flavors balancing out with each other (and also, Jjanga probably makes the best salmon skin hand roll in town).  A lot of people take apps for granted when they go to a sushi restaurant. I would urge you to not look over the apps at Jjanga, because you would be missing out. Because the same care and quality he and his chefs put into the sushi, the same great quality and care is being put into the appetizers. The first thing you must order is the golden scallop. A thick, meaty, whole scallop that is lightly battered, and simply fried. It's a great way to start your meal. The baby octopus is a textural sensation, with the chewiness of the octopus, offsetting with the crispiness in the preparation. And do save yourself room for an oyster. That would be the icing on the cake! But try all the apps, i'm sure you won't be disappointed.     Jjanga has been killing it at his original location and it only makes sense for him to expand due to the growing popularity. The skill, the eye, the level of detail, and the caring for his guests are without question. No doubt I will be back and I always bring people here who want some great quality sushi from a great chef. Thanks Jjanga!!",

Our sake came soon and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend the flavored sake they make. Our nigiri orders started coming to the table in about 10 min. The food was all very fresh. I love that they don't smother the fish with a ton of rice. The presentation of the food was pretty typical for sushi. The ambiance of the restaurant is family friendly with half the restaurant having hibachi. The service was wonderful. We had the wait staff stopping and making sure we were doing alright and if we wanted to place any more orders. Overall, very happy with my visit. The food was great and the service was wonderful.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I love this place and this review only reflects this visit. Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of zero is the sushi chefs. The service was absolutely horrible tonight! We didn't get any refills on the sodas, all the appetizers took forever to come out and my girlfriend ordered her miso soup and house salad twice and never received it! The servers were not courteous at all. I think I'll only go to the decatur location from now on.  I'm very disappointed in Jjanga tonight",

They make you feel so welcomed, and comfortable, which is very important to me especially when they are the ones preparing your food! I am a fan of the three some, and who's your daddy! They have fun creative names and it makes dinner become and experience.",
