The menu is still standard American fare.  The best part is the memorabilia on the walls. Hardly anyone was there when we went for brunch on a Sunday, so we were able to wander around the restaurant and look at the stuff to our heart's content.  My only beef was that they said they served breakfast/brunch but I didn't see any breakfast items on the menu.  Maybe we were too late, but doesn't brunch usually run until 2pm on Sundays?",

First off, they aren't open for breakfast until 8am, which I thought was more than strange considering the crazy hours one makes while in Vegas. I had jet lag during the trip and was eating breakfast at 630am and 730am and heck sometimes my friends weren't getting in til 9am!   Anyway, I digress... I ordered the standard 2 egg breakfast. It was massive. 2 people could easily split it. My only issue is that it was crazy greasy...even for this southern girl. Maybe they make it that way for all the drunks who need the grease to soak up the alcohol but it just made me feel sick. They were nice enough to sub out the bread for fruit and there was a lot of it. Service was a bit slow also. Otherwise, great value for the money.",

Basically, the new Hard Rock Cafe is a three-tier building of Rock-N-Roll fun.  First floor is the walk-in HRC store with all the cool shirts, hats, sweaters, etc.  Quick escalator ride up to the second floor and your in the cafe.    I personally didn't get a chance to grab a bite, but I've eaten at the Maui, Miami, and old Vegas cafes and have never been disappointed (definitely review update).  Take the stairs or elevator up to the third floor and you've reach the concert venue.    The top floor offers a great outdoor balcony with a splendid view of the Vegas strip.  There is a large bar located on one side of the room and various locations with shot girls.  The VIP side of the venue also offers free Coors Light and Blue Moon brew for the opening acts.  Overall, I had a fantastic time and look forward to catching another event at the Hard Rock Cafe soon.",

There are huge windows near the bar, overlooking all the chaos outside.  The bar area is quite nice, although, in True bar fashion, the drinks are too expensive.  It was fairly dead in there (being a Sunday night) and the bartender was pretty cool. I had ordered a Vodka Cranberry, and it was waaay too expensive, but poured with Smirnoff.  Being a bit of a vodka snob, I asked the bartender how much is the different to pour Ketel One or Chopin.  It was $1.50; cool. Next drink I ordered, I'd get it that way.  So I turn to talk to my friends, and a few minutes later, the bartender brings me a new vodka cranberry, with Chopin to replace my original drink and wasn't charging me for the difference.  What a nice guy!  Later in the night he also gave one of the girls in our party a round of shots for us. They were terrible! But they were free =)  The area to watch the band/dance is spacious with a good amount of tables.  The band itself, Sin City Sinners, was good, as always. I have seen them a few times and they're full of energy and awesome hard rock!  As we stumbled down the stairs at the end of the night (be careful!), we stopped at a couple tabletop arcade style games and played for a while.  That was fun too!",

Margaritas were good, about $15, at the end of your meal they give you your receipt and you go to the store downstairs and you get a \"free\" monogrammed margarita glass.. Kinda cool if you care about something like that?   The hamburger that they are supposedly known for kinda sucks.  The patty looks/tasted like it was microwaved and wasn't medium like we ordered it was def well done. The main reason we came here was the awesome outside seating and view of the strip! Def was a plus. Other than that beers were fairly priced and was a good time?",

Its on the third floor I think and just go without a reservation, you will very very likely get a table. You can easily get lost in that place. Burgers are 15 bucks and very good and filling. They have truffle fries too and its all tasty. Other entrees like steak and stuff are more expensive obviously and average around high 20's to low 30's.

It's the usual high prices of Hard Rock (ouch!). They take your picture before you can get a table. I really didn't appreciate this. We all looked like crap after a long day walking the Strip, and my daughter has some sensory issues that cause her to not like situations like that. I didn't like being forced into that. It would be nice if they *asked* if you wanted your picture, not corralled you into the picture station right after the hostess station.  So after the picture taking, we then got hounded by our waiter to join some VIP club. No thanks, I'm here to eat. After we got hounded by the waiter, we got hounded by another girl who brought our pictures to our table and wanted us to buy them. Thanks but no thanks, they look awful and I'm dropping too much on dinner anyways. I really just wanted to be left alone to enjoy my meal, but I couldn't! I do like the Hard Rock atmosphere, with the music & the memorabilia.   The twisted mac n chicken n cheese was no where NEAR as good as the same meal I got in San Francisco. I don't know what went wrong there. For $20, it better be fabulous, and it just wasn't at all.",

One was the Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders(3) with Tomatillo Jam, Micro Cilantro and the other was the Braised Short Rib Tacos(3) with Frenso & Corn Slaw, Cilantro Lime Aoili. Both sounded pretty good.  The cocktail was super weak. I get Asian glow easily and this cocktail did nothing to me. Maybe because it was free? As for the sliders, I actually did enjoy them, though the jam was a bit on the sweet side. We just used some of the guacamole from the taco dish and it made the sliders amazing, haha. As for the tacos, they're just standard tacos. Not bad at all, but not amazing.  Service was a bit too... perky for my tastes. Waitress was definitely nice, but I can only handle so much bubbliness. Probably awesome if you're bringing a family here, though, so not factoring it into my rating.  But mainly, Hard Rock Cafe gets 3 stars for 3 star food. Though I have no idea why a cafe about Rock was bumping Skrillex.",

I said 3 and they said ok we will put you in the back. Didn't understand why we were being buried in the back and I felt somewhat insulted. Not worried about it because I will never go here again. This is why I am writing this to make sure that none of my friends or fellow yelpers get hosed like I did. It gets better so please read on.   Shortly after being seated our waiter Larry showed up and seemed very nice. My wife ordered a water, my daughter ordered a pink lemonade and I ordered a Guinness. Larry was slick with pressuring my wife to order a frozen drink. I noticed that on the menu you could ask the waiter about purchasing a pint glass or a hurricane glass for an additional fee. we were never offered if we even wanted to purchase the glasses. Larry decided that we needed them. When I ordered my meal I ordered The Texan. I ate the meal and it was not that bad. Larry was helpful and courteous. Then I got the bill and found that I was charged the 17.50 super sized price for the meal vs the 13.50 price that I noticed was on the menu. I didn't ask nor was I offered the super sized meal for the 17.50 price. Larry was slick again and had gotten over on me. I had not noticed anything at this point on the check. Larry tried to get us to have dessert but we passed on it. Larry had asked me to do a customer survey as he gets great feedback from his job. I assured him that I would give him feedback. He also sat at our table and tried to explain something else to us about a menu item that was not on our table. we declined to have it and Larry said I just had to tell you about it because I always forget.  This Larry guy basically got over on us and made us pay for things that we really didn't want. I could have gone back up stairs and made a scene but I figured I would just tell everyone what they did to me and hope that no one else gets taken. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!! I am sure that his company makes him do these things to people and this is why you must go down stairs to pay for your meal. They are a sneaky and they got me this once. Never again!!

However while eating we notice some food didn't taste as fresh but we were hungry and had a flight to catch. After we left we almost immediately felt sick. Our whole flight home we were throwing up and felt awful. I called the manager the next day to explain the issue but he was completely defensive saying no one else had that issue. Which is fine. But it takes only one mistake. One person not washing their hands or bad batch of food. Nonetheless he said he would contact me and never did. $70 down the drain and the attention to the matter was lackluster. Never again",

Anywho I didn't pay so not sure the cost but it is Vegas so likely over priced. However if you like Rock, worth the visit!",

We arrived around 8:45 on a Saturday night with a party of 12 and were fortunately seated within 30 minutes-the restaurant was not crowded at all. That alone should probably say something. The reason my group picked this as a dinner spot was due to the number of picky eaters and unwillingness to stray too far from their hotel. This was 100% not my choice to eat dinner here, but with so many good reviews, I figured there might be something that was appealing. After we were seated, our server brought us menus right away and drinks came quickly along with the nacho appetizers we ordered for the table. That part of the meal was fine-no complaints here. Nachos were run of the mill-not bad but nothing stellar. It turned out that I was glad these were ordered, because my actual meal was terrible. I ordered the Veggie burger-on the menu it's clear this is not an ordinary veggie burger. It comes topped with \"roasted\" veggies-Portobello, zucchini, peppers and onions. On paper that sounded good but the execution was lacking. The veggies were flavorless, soggy and oily. The veggie patty itself didn't seem well cooked and had an odd taste to it. The fries it came with were okay-nothing that stood out-adequate but the disappointment in the veggie burger itself outweighed any goodness there. I'm sure the kitsch value of this place has value to some people but for me this a waste of time, money and an opportunity to have a good meal after a long day of adventures in Vegas. Never again.",

    "text": "There might exist a need to separate reviews now, being that the venue has its own name and therefore listing, and there was already reason for an update in any case.   For those of you wondering, you can execute a review for the venue (Hard Rock Live as of 2013) for itself here: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hard-rock-live-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/hard-rock-l...</a>.   The Hard Rock Cafe comprises three levels directly across from Monte Carlo's Diablo's Cantina on the strip. First floor is a merch store and box office (for HRL); second floor is the restaurant/bar; and, the third floor is a venue/bar known now as Hard Rock Live. There is memorabilia on all three floors.   This review will strictly be for the restaurant -- being that I have never purchased any merch -- and, the venue has its own listing where one can leave a rating (mine: 3 ). So here goes ...  Food is just alright; and the view is nice if you get seated with one. I have had salads (monstrous in size); burgers (usually cooked to the incorrect specified temperature [charred like a motherfucker]); and, fries (just fries: nothing special). In fact, the entire restaurant can be summed up to just that: Nothing Special.   Pro Tip: there is usually a coupon for money off of one's cheque in those Vegas2GoTM magazines found all around the strip corridor. They are small (brochure-sized) and red and white. - E",

We sat for an extended amount of time before we were even greeted at our seat.  Finally, when another waitress noticed us looking around, she found someone to wait on us. Thankfully, our waiter was great. He went above and beyond to make our experience at the restaurant good! We needed extra chips for the spinach artichoke dip - no big deal! The bartender accidentally made an extra mojito, and our waiter brought it to our table to try instead of throwing it out!  I asked for light on my dressing for my grilled shrimp ceasar salad, but it was definitely not light! Heavy on the dressing. I would recommend just getting it on the side. I gave a lack of star for the hair my friend found in her chicken chopped salad - otherwise she said it tasted great. To finish our visit off on a good note, our waiter comped us a vanilla fudge Sundae with a cherry on top. I applaud his effort.",

Our food was average it was tasty but needed some tweeking. We got the Twisted Mac and Cheese and a side of French Fries. Love the mac and cheese and the garlic toast it came with, chicken was dry and plain. Fries were ok, could be crispier, most likely frozen. Friends got the chicken fingers and a salad, they looked good, and all the food was consumed without complaints.

I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry.   Drinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.  Service: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.  Our guy was spot on, full of energy, would sing along with the tracks in the background and give us descriptions of the dishes.  Now if only the descriptions could turn into taste, it would have been a better experience.",

If you sit outsie, do not sit outside around 3pm as the sun will be right in your face.  The staff as usual was absolutly terrific.  Very friendly and great to deal with.  The food was the usual ok.  We had the BBW three plate sampler.  A little over done, a little not done, typical HRC food.  You go there for the atmoshere, the scene, the pins and all things HRC!  It is awesome is is now on the strip!  :)",

I ordered the \"rockin' wings\" and boy were they every bit of that name. They had a good punch to them and were cooked to perfection....I make some great wings at home which I will never divulge what goes on them - LOL - but these were so good, my wife even compared them to the ones from home and she never does that! i was definitely impressed and would love to order a larger size the next time I'm in town. The ambiance of sitting on the patio by the strip is a definite must if you're wiling to brave the Vegas breeze at night or the heat during the day. The nightlife is the best because of everything that's going on down below!",

Tip: park at Monte Carlo for free and walk over to avoid parking fees in the garage connected to it ;) And try the breakfast quesadilla, its magically delicious",

My hubby ended up ordering some blueberry pancakes for $14.00 and my daughter had the chicken and waffle for $17.95 YIKES. Yes, just one piece of fried chicken on one waffle. Nothing fancy.  I did take a small bite and it tasted ok. Nothing out of this world. You'd think for that price they would of put a whole fried chicken on 10 waffles. My hubby liked his pancakes. They were big and fluffy, but again.... not worth the price.  I had to remember....It's about the experience. ..right? SoOOoo...we sat outside over looking the Vegas strip. Interesting, may I say the least.  Almost reminded me of being in New Orleans during Mardi gras time.  Yeah...Nope.",

Would recommend anyone who plans to not actually sit at the bar or order drinks request to be seated in the main dining area. Seating otherwise (in this day) gets forgotten about resulting in slow service and the music, although great, is too loud it is difficulty to have a conversation. Typical Hard Rock location, awesome displays of memorabilia and classic music videos playing on the screen in the booth seating. Meatloaf brings back so many memories.... overall still a favorite restaurant of mine but for the vegetarians the options are few, good luck.",

    "text": "Place is brutal. From start to finish. First, it took at least 10 minutes for our server to even come greet us and take drink orders. Second, I ordered a simply grilled chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato only(ie no mayo, bacon or cheese). Simple, right? Well, it arrives at the table and looks the part. However, when I go to spinkle salt and pepper on the patty I realize the sandwich is literally just lettuce, tomato plus mayo. No chicken lol!!! Okay, sh*t happens. I tell the waitress it has no chicken plus it has mayo on it and she says sorry and she will be right back with my sandwich. The second one arrives and it has the chicken but it still is covered in mayo. WTF? Cmon already. So off that one goes and I have to wait for a 3rd one with no mayo covered all over the thing.  Meanwhile, my wife and daughter are almost done with their meals before my 3rd sandwich finally arrives. Terrible. I'm not the type to hunt down a manager and make a 3 ring circus about it inside the restaurant(but I will give you a BAD review when I get the time) but shouldn't a manager be notified by a waitress when an order gets that messed up??? Finally, to top it all off we get handed the bill and I put my two gift cards plus my credit card inside as I wait for the waitress to return.   It is literally almost 15 minutes of waiting before I have enough and simply left my two gift cards plus took my cc back and left cash for the difference plus 15 percent tip. I should have left no tip but the waitress at least had a decent attitude. Bottom line, this place sucks for service and the food aint even that good tbh. I come here every year and this is my last time. The service is consistently sloooooooooooow. Not worth my aggravation anymore.",

Hubbs ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the burger plate with breakfast potatoes. It would've been nice if our server told us that adding mushrooms and onions was an additional $3 each...really?   Overall our bill was $45, aside from food I ordered soda water and Hubbs ordered orange juice.  This place was pretty expensive for breakfast, but at least the food was good.

She even went above and beyond to fix it. Once it was settled we ordered our food and it only took maybe 10 min.  All the staff was friendly and could see my hangryness. But they were all attentive and we even got a secont book for my nephew. I got the texan it was beyond amazing. I would recomend the atmosphere. And kimberley if you read this thankyou so much!!!!!

We made reservation for 05/4/19 and attended the restaurant at the Las Vegas blvd south location as it was the birthday girl's favorite restaurant. We told our server Dayelin that we are celebrating her birthday. We ordered dinner and she only checked on us once in about the two hours we were there. The only time she took care of us was when it was time to pay for our check. We found that there was no recognition for anything for the birthday girl and she or the crew never came out to sing or do anything special. We were very disappointed since we had made it aware to the server. Even just saying \"Happy Birthday\" would had been nice. It seemed like she did not believe us or care to help make it a special day for her even when she looked at her ID for drinks. Very disappointed with the  service when we spent almost $200. We have even sent an email to hard rock cafe customer service regarding our experience. It has been about a month now and there was no response. From this experience, will not recommend to family and friends.",

Our waiter Damon was so nice and attentive even though the restaurant was closing in an hour.  We both ordered drinks which were tasty and strong!  I had the Air Mexico (a trio of 3 different flavored drinks)....I loved the Cucumber!  For dinner, we both had burgers.  Oh man were they delicious!  I had the hickory BBQ burger and it was cooked to perfection.  The burger is accompanied with their seasoned fries and sriracha mayo (pure heaven).  For a chain restaurant, this place is pretty awesome.  I'll definitely come back!",

I had the fish and chips with teo long islands (birthday drinks) and I even got to take a souvenir glass and Dan had a burger. What is great about Las Vegas is if your not finished with your drink you can take it on the strip with you,  and that exactly what I did!   This Hard Rock really has the best Rock 'n' Roll Memorabilia! While we didnt check any out they have shows as well. If you in Vegas and any kind of a music fan, which I am sure you are, check out this Hard Rock.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying the service in Las Vegas restaurants (particularly on the Strip) seem to have one common theme - POOR SERVICE  The Hard Rock Cafe is no exception to this observation.   I get it. You work in a tourist trap. You get mixed (good and bad) tips regardless of effort because you are serving people from different cultures and different tipping beliefs, but that shouldn't mean you just disappear.   This week my girlfriend and I met up for lunch with a couple of friends that happened to also be visiting Vegas. We tried to get them to choose a non-chain, but they argued that they knew what to expect with a chain. Fine... Hard Rock it was.   We walked in, walked up the stairs, put our name down. The place was basically empty since it was about 2:00 p.m., so we were seated in about 5 minutes. This is where the service begins and ends.   We sat there with menus for 15 minutes (this is no exaggeration) . We flagged down several people and asked them if they could find a server for us, but instead they just kept walking by obnoxiously singing along with the music playing in the background (or in some cases, just shouting out lyrics to unrelated songs). I THINK the servers think this is 'entertaining', but I can tell you that none of us at our table were impressed - especially after waiting that long.   Once the waiter arrived (sweating), he apologized profusely, feeding us with several disjunct reasons. We presented him with 2 for 1 drink cards that were distributed by the people standing in front of the restaurant. He seemed to be clueless as to their validity. He ran back to his manager and came back confirming the 'deal'. We were debating on whether or not this waiter was drunk, as he just seemed disconnected.  Anyway... We ordered our food. It was what you expect from any chain restaurant like this, fairly bland, generic, etc. If you are not familiar with Hard Rock Cafe, it is basically a TGIFriday or Chili's with a Rock-n-Roll theme (walls covered in rock memorabilia). Needless to say, you are paying for the ambiance and to look at the rock memorabilia, not the food. Once you wrap your head around that, the prices are... well... still too high for what you get.  I would suggest avoiding all of the 'sit-down' restaurants that have doors that open to the Strip. They have a non-stop line of customers coming in, so they know they don't need to work hard. As for the Hard Rock Cafe, I would just avoid it regardless of the country you are in. This is a relic from the 70s and 80s that just doesn't know when it is time to close the doors.",

Not sure how that happened? Our kids had mac&cheese, and a kids cheeseburger. The cheeseburger looked fine, but my daughter wouldn't eat it because of the char grill. She's like Hank from 'King Of The Hill'  - wants to \"taste the meat, not the heat.\"     I can say with sincerity that I will not be back. Looks like a cool enough bar though.

First of all the staff was just amazing, I don't remember ever being treated better at a restaurant! Every person we interacted with was very friendly and helpful, like above and beyond helpful! Our server was a bit off the wall to look at, but it appears they encourage it here and I think that is why everyone here seemed to really enjoy working for Hard Rock.   I ordered a burger special which was basted in an IPO Bbq sauce, topped with a grilled pineapple, bacon, and some mango salsa. It was a half pound burger, and I was a bit worried about that, because they often end up being bland and dry, but their patty was very high quality and tasty, and cooked a perfect medium rare. My burger was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  I also got my burger with a side of bacon cheese fries which were delicious, the fries were crispy, the cheese was melty, and it was real bacon chopped up and fried to a crisp, no cheap bacon bits here.   My wife ordered the smokehouse sandwich, which was a pulled chicken sandwich topped off with haystack onions, fried jalapenos, and a chipotle puree. She thought it was good but wished she had gotten the pork instead, as she isn't a huge fan of pulled chicken, and thought it was a BBQ chicken breast when she ordered it (her oversight in reading the menu) I had a bite or 2 and thought it was really good, the chicken was fresh and had a nice crisp to it, but was also tender, juicy and flavorful.  I also ordered a \"Strawberry Basil Lemonade\" which was just delicious, and a godsend on such a hot day! Usually the default combo would be mint leaf, but wow basil is my new favorite lemonade additive!  I'm glad we stopped in here, and will make Hard Rock a regular stop from here on out, if I had one complaint it would be that their prices are pretty out of control, but then again what isn't in Vegas?",

Host was very happy to change our tables - no fuss!!! Our server (Star of the whole experience) Ashley came and took our order for beverages.  She even helped us with couple of items in menu and recommeded sauc for my chicken - which happeded to be the best choice.  My daughter was bit upset for somereason and was crying.  Ashley took a note of that but didnt say anything.  Our food came and it was awesome except my daughter didn't like the Pizza she ordered.  She told Ashley when she came to check on us....She took the Pizza off of our check! At the end of our lunch, Ashley said that she has a surprise for my daughter and brought a cup of ice-cream!!! Put a big smile on her (my daughter's) face.... Ashley saved the day for us....She even took a pin (Disney pin) out of her pin belt and gifted to my daughter.  She went above and beyond to make our dining experience awesome and she did that.    Yes the food is bit pricey, but you will enjoy your visit with your date, family, friends, colleagues, spouse or even just treating your self to lunch or dinner!",

Our server was great, very friendly and saved us a couple bucks by offering the bottomless drink and a refill on her margarita. We both got the pulled chicken sandwich and wow, it was SO good. I wasn't that hungry but as soon as I tasted it, it was gone in seconds. Would definitely recommend. I got the Bahama Mama bottomless drink and it was dangerously good. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all, and she got a berrygarita and she also loved it. Our drinks also came with free glasses so that was pretty neat to take home with us! I will definitely come back",

First it's hard to get to and you have to pay $10 to park here and now that they closed the original off the strip location by the hotel this is your only option now and that just sucks!  Even when it's slow like today (after I spent close to $300 in their shop) it took me 20 min. to even see the waiter.  The food and drink order went in and we got our food quickly, but our drinks didn't come till after our food was half way gone and the bottle they gave me without even asking for a glass.  Not a bad option if you're a tourist and walking by, but locals aren't treated too well around here and there are too many other options for us!",

But, it's okay, we were there for breakfast on a free gift card from our lodging location.  Did you know Hard Rock Cafe had breakfast??  I didn't even realize it until I got the gift card!  But, we ended up skipping the breakfast items and went straight for some comfort food after a hard night of drinking the night before!  I had the potato skins and they were pretty good.  You know potato skins are hit and miss, sometimes delish and other times nasty, these were good, some of them better than others and a fair amount of toppings (cheese bacon and onions) on top, served with sour cream.  It hit the spot though.  The husband had chicken tenders with spicy sauce and he did not complain.  Our server was friendly and attentive and we were in and out pretty quick.    I'm a big fan of the Hard Rock locations because I LOVE the memorabilia, so I took a few minutes to walk around and peek at the goodies on the walls.  Good stuff and a good visit.  Will totally go back, especially since this location is just around the corner from my time share.",

It's definitely a good place to check out a show, particularly if it's general admission, as ours was.   There will be confusion when you arrive and try to decide where they woud possibly have a concert in this damned t-shirt shop. Fear not. Walk to the back of the t-shirt shop and go up the stairs. The line will form beginning at the top of those stairs at second floor level (the restaurant).  Once the \"doors\" open, you'll move up another flight to the 3rd floor venue.  If the show is 21+ you *must* have ID. Yes, even you, you old son of a bitch. Even you. There's a pretty intense search, then you're in.  I hope your fellow audience members are as chicken shit as ours were. Most of them lingered in the back by the bar and windows, leaving the entire floor open for the taking. We opted to take about 15 square feet touching the stage, right in front of the lead singer's microphone. We saw Psychedelic Furs this night. I posted a pic taken from our piece of land. Pretty darned impressive! I never thought I'd have Richard Butler sweat on me, but I'll be damned if that didn't happen.   The chicken shits soon realized, \"oh, hey, it sure would be cool to be down there in front\" and they tried to commandeer our space. No way, chumps.  Good acoustics. I wouldn't hesitate to see another show here.",

On this particular trip to Vegas, I was traveling with my son. We were celebrating his birthday and it was a work function...so a win win for us both.   We were staying at the Wynn and took a taxi to the Hard Rock. We enjoyed the casino and the restaurant. It was the first time at the casino part of a Hard Rock, so believe me I enjoyed that part of it. Didn't win anything major here but at least broke even. Once I locate the photos I will upload to the review.   We had a great time and will definitely enjoy this one again next time in Vegas.",

The prices are super high. Yes, it's Vegas and to be expected, but much higher than they should be I feel.  Nevertheless, if you're a hard rock fan, then the prices are well worth it. The food was average tasting, the drinks were \"okay\" and the service, well the service was pretty bomb, I'll give you that. The waitress made this place fun and spunky.   Head downstairs and visit the hard rock shop. WE took photos of the lady that encouraged us to come in and eat. She did a good job and was very friendly. I am glad we went. Nothing mind blowing, but good customer service makes everything better.",

So I think either it was a chief's mistake or it might be a vegan burger but they certainly cooked it with the regular burger, either way, it was not acceptable regarding the honesty and the reputation of Hard Rock Cafe!!",

The top floor was the only one with football on and the menu is extremely limited on this floor. Like 5 or 6 items and that's it. We got the pretzel, which was good, and nachos. There was absolutely nothing special about the nachos but we scarfed them because we were starving and nothing else was going to do it on the menu. Even when we left there were only 2 more tables of patrons.   Again, the waitstaff was great and there's plenty of TVs to watch the games on. But don't come thinking you'll get a meal.

Inside was a lot warmer, quite. To the point that we shared some chicken wings that were perfect - especially with the dipping sauce. Great entree, however it could have easily have been a main meal for us both!  We couldn't get through the last wing so we left it and advised the waiter that we left it for him. As his tip. Good thing he laughed with us instead of getting snarky.  I got the Texan burger, which was huge and oh soooooooooo very delish.   Granted by this time we were already into our 2nd cocktail so everything was great!  When we paid we were advised that we could pick up our cocktail glasses from the counter downstairs... Wait! What?  That's right lovelies, they forget to mention that you earn yourself a nice little memento from getting drunk on cocktails!! WIN! (and to make this even better it made it all the way back to Sydney without breaking, double win!)  All in all, great food... great booze and waiters that laugh with you.",

Now, Hard Rock has always been a pretty pricey eatery, but I guess when in Vegas you think, \"I could get like, two drinks for the price of that hamburger.\" I ordered a bloody mary (gin) and my friend ordered a specialty drink that came in a souvenir glass. I knew before the check came that her drink would be at least $15.   And I was right. My well gin bloody mary was about $7 while her floofy tanning-lotion reminiscent bath water cost her double. Here's a tip: never assume the server is trying to get you to order what they like best, they are trying to UPSELL. They will want to sell you the most expensive thing on the menu.   Our server had a bit of an attitude when he messed up my bloody mary but hey, I used to be a server and I know I was within my rights. Fix it. I'm not drinking vodka. We left within about 20 minutes to find a cheaper place to eat.  One cool note, however, a manager was making rounds asking guests where they were from and taking msuic video requests. I requested Cinderella and my friend Journey and both were played prior to our departure. What a cool idea!  I would think that Hard Rock would be more.... Hard Rock. It seems like this place has gotten a little soft. Where's the rock'n'roll, the tattoos, the black hair, the leather and lace? Perhaps I need to come back at night, when the Disneyland families with their porkchop kids are safely tucked in to their beds at Circus Circus.",

When I contacted him, he apologized for the inconvenience and wanted more details. He explained that the waiter was new and promised to search for my receipt to review the charges. It took him about two days but he found my receipt  and issued me a partial refund for the items I was overcharged for.   There was nothing he could do about my experience while it happened, because he was unaware of the situation, but he did what he could to rectify the situation.   What more could I ask for?",

    "text": "We are here for Yelp Elite Vegas. Normally, my group would probably not stop here to grab a bite to eat as one thing we try to be is adventurous. But as a sponsor to our great gathering, you get our gratitude and our business.  Most will probably not see the same menu that us Yelpers saw at the prices we saw, but I'll be blunt and say it was pretty much happy hour dishes at higher than usual prices. Yes, we are in Vegas, but if you are not going to be a buffet or fancy then you better be cheap.  Oh Hard Rock food, I have a 3 star feeling about you:  -=-Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders-=- Too bready for the meat and flavor content. Pork Belly is so yummy when it leaks it's juices all over your bread. Wasn't the case here.  -=-Braised Short Rib Tacos-=- They weren't stuffed by any means, but I felt were the most tasty of the bunch. The bites into these were the most enjoyable I had for this meal.  -=-Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos-=- These were a crispy surprise, but then again you dip anything in ranch and I'm a fan. Dip my napkin in ranch and I'd probably faint.  -=-Twisted Mac and Cheese-=- We ordered this outside of the Yelp menu. It was all tons of cheesy. For what it was, without meat additives (ignoring the chicken on top, doesn't count), it was a good blend, but was still missing something. Can't put a finger to it.  Oh Michael, so awesome you were as our server. You were 5 star awesome. The Yelp Elites were in town and you delivered. We'll be sure to post of our group photo here. I hope our other Yelp Elites were able to have the pleasure as well.",

The restaurant is on the 2nd level of this 3-level venue.  The first level is mainly the merchandise store, and the third level is for events.  We came in for lunch and I ordered the chicken fajitas.  The dish comes out on a smoking sizzling hot plate.  Trust me, everyone in the place will \"ooh\" and \"ahhh\" as the server brings it to you, haha!  It's not the most amazing fajitas you will ever have, but it's pretty tasty.  My coworker got the twisted mac and cheese and chicken tupelos, which is a form chicken tenders but breaded with panko.  Both of these were so yummy!  Next time I go in, that's what I will have to stick to.  My company also had our holiday party at this venue on the 3rd floor.  The venue for events is absolutely perfect.  It's huge and either a band or DJ can fit on the stage.  The staff is super helpful, reliable and friendly.  We've never had any issues.    Definitely recommended for both food and for events.",

After we left the table, a waiter came by and re-arranged the silverware we moved. Didn't want to tell us we were sitting in the wrong area but how dare we mess up the table. Then he came to our new table to give us menus. He became our waiter at the new table. I made a comment to him about sitting in the wrong area before and he ignored it.

    "text": "Paid $195 to watch March Madness here for one day in 2018. There was a long line to get in. The event is on the top floor. We were able to download a gambling app to place bets, which was really convenient. Pretty basic beers available for the event. The food was a little disappointing. The breakfast had eggs and other standard breakfast items. I read about the delicious breakfast burritos, but apparently one of the chefs was out sick, so not available on the day that I was there. Lunch and dinner are the same. For $195 I was expecting a change. Not pictured are the pizza and the chicken enchiladas. The enchiladas were pretty much the best thing to eat.  There were plenty of big screen TVs to watch all of the games. There was really great energy from the crowds and no one was getting out of hand. The bathroom had a valet, which wasn't really necessary. I probably won't be going back. Watching 12 hours of basketball gets to be a little much.  Overall, a nice place to watch March Madness on the strip, but not enough variety in their food served.",

    "text": "Yes, there are now TWO Hard Rock Cafes in Vegas. The original Paradise/Harmon location (which is in front of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), and this one, which is on the Las Vegas Strip itself.   If you are not familiar with the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants, you have clearly been living under a rock for the past few decades. Essentially, they combine great food and tons of awesome musical memorabilia and the like on display. These places are a music fan's dream come True.   The Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip is unique because it is set up in a 3-story arrangement. The first floor and main entrance is the gift shop. The second floor is the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant itself. And the third floor is a bar/concert venue.   As far as the concert venue goes, this place is excellent. I went in here for the first time the other night to see Dio Disciples, and the size of the venue is just right. It is intimate, but still manages to fit a ton of music fans. Plus the sound quality is excellent. You can stand by the stage, or go to the bar or a table/chair to sit down, so you'll be well off either way. There is even a balcony with a kick-ass view of the Strip exterior.  Most of my complaints with the place stem from the entrance/location/lines for shows/etc. Being on the Las Vegas Strip, just getting to the associated Showcase Mall parking garage can be a challenge (it costs $3 to park in this garage, but it is far and above your best option.) Finding the garage is tricky because the signs directing you there are so small and easy to miss. Likewise, to get into the show, we had to wait in a line, and the line actually went up a flight of stairs. Traversing stairs is fine, but being forced to wait on them in a crowd for long periods of time is not pleasant. Also, expect the full \"being carded/pat down/metal detector\" treatment.   But all things considered, once you find the parking garage and a show that you want to go to, or even if you're just wandering the Strip and want to shop and eat, this place is great. Definitely worth your time, whether you're a local or a tourist.",

    "text": "came here mega hungover for breakfast after attending a late-night vegas wedding. the place was super empty around 9.30am - not too surprising as i'm sure most people were still out from the night before or too hungover to move.  breakfast menu was pretty slim, maybe 5 or 6 options but the waitress said many of the normal menu items could be prepared if we asked. i ordered a standard breakfast for $10.85 - eggs, bacon, toast, and potatoes. everything was great minus the bacon - a crazy thick layer of pepper and salt covered it. totalllllly gross. bacon doesn't need seasoning! it's great on its own!  service was fine, food came out fast, and it was more reasonably priced than i expected. it's good if you're in a hurry to get on the road, but if you're not in a time crunch, i suggest heading over to the strip for an amazing brunch buffet instead.",

My only complaint is that the menu is pricey but otherwise what a nice restaurant to stop by for dinner before seeing a live music show :)",

    "text": "My wife and I came here last night for dinner after a little retail therapy at Ross about 3 stores down. I've considered Hard Rock Cafe as the quintessential tourist resto with all the souvenirs on the first floor. We sat at the bar as we didn't want to wait 20 min for a table and they serve the full menu at the bar anyways. We got the Bruschetta ($11.95) and we split the Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas ($21.95). I got the Mango Berry Cooler ($4) as it was over 107 degrees outside (this was around 8 pm here in Vegas!). They also offer a Souvenir glass for $5 extra to put your drink in which, as the server told us, doubles the serving of the drink. The food was pretty good but I could tell the chicken and shrimp were frozen just by their texture.  I wouldn't say that I would come here often as the prices are on the high side but the service was good. I would come here if I was in the mood for a good burger, fries, and some good old 90s music...",

    "text": "I came in one night for a concert, but I was early. Which was okay as I hadn't eaten since breakfast so I needed food before booze. So I took a seat at the bar and ordered.  I had a SOB Burger, which is a cheeseburger with guac and chipotle. It was kind of uninspiring as far as a burger goes - massive, but I felt like the chipotle flavor was played down. Also it fell apart after the first couple of bites - to be fair, I think they anticipated it, they gave me a big ass steak knife to go with it. The fries were really good.  Alcohol: I gave up drinking after the first two rounds, because my draft Newcastle Ale was 5.60. Don't drink on the Strip if you're a local, you will always be disappointed. The bartender was attentive to my needs and cashed me out quickly.  The Concert: The real reason to come here is that the third floor is a MASSIVE concert space. It's a really nice venue, and they've been booking really interesting gigs. The bar service looked good, but like I said, I quit indulging after dinner so I don't know about the service/prices.",

For starters, the sound was better than other Hard Rock locations that I've been to and the layout of the place was  spacious and inviting, allowing a patron to see everything everywhere, no matter what room one might be standing in.  They had some very cool memorabilia on the walls, just as we've all come to expect of the Hard Rock, except this time it appears that they put a lot more thought into the color schemes than what I've seen before. The bar had a great selection and surprisingly reasonable prices - considering its high profile location - and that was pretty much the icing on the cake for ensuring my return.",

    "text": "Was there on Wed. June 17.  Was there with my husband who was in a wheel chair.  They sat us right away, I asked for a booth right from the start.  Booth seats feel better on my husbands legs.  So this blond gal takes us to a regular table and removes a chair.  She says, roll him here.  There was a whole wall full of empty booths near the doors where the food comes out. I said can't we just have one of these, she turns silent and starts mumbling into her walkie talkie, I said again, can we sit here, she's still ignoring me talking in to that damn thing.  Then she just points to the booth and walks away. So we literally sit there for no less than 10 min until the savior of the experience shows up and says \"are you guys being helped\"  I said NO.  She said \"don't worry guys, I'll take care of you\"  and she meant it, she didn't miss a beat.  I wish I got her name, she was the coolest.  She had brown/reddish hair up in a bun, We both had the Hard Rock Club sandwich and it was great.  She turned the whole experience around for us because we were just about to leave seconds before she came to us.  The other annoyance was this skinny black bald guy who was playing up the whole \"bro\" thing too thick to his coworkers and cussing every time he passed us by.  Fuckin fuckin fuck bro fuck fuck bro is all we heard from him. A for our waitress, hugz to you.",

I've made plenty of trips to Vegas through my years but this was my 1st & 2nd time going to this Hard Rock Cafe within two days over this past weekend.  We had the pleasure of having some of the best bartenders Vegas has ever seen during our visit. We were greeted right away from the badazz himself, Kyle! What a great guy. A friend of ours wanted to by us a shot but did not know what to buy specifically. Kyle made a very unique suggestion which was a great one in my books. I have heard of this shot before in the past but never attempted to have it up until this past weekend. He suggested \"Dead Nazi's\". Yes, it's a real shot! After that great shot, we asked for another recommendation in which he was more than happy to do so. He suggested \"Sex with an alligator\" and yes, this is another True shot! Kyle had Woody set up this next shot with us which was a great addition to the very unique line of shots. Woody kicked A$$ as well and gave us some pointers about what we were having. These guys rock!  You may think I am making this all up but trust me I'm not. No one in Hollywood could make this up!  I apologize in advanced for not adding the blonde female bartender who I thought had an accent for some reason. She said she had a heavy tongue when it came to pronunciation. She was very dope and took care of us on day one of our visit. Rock on!!  The group and I will unquestionably be back to soon!",

Our server (Stoli) was super nice and met our needs.  He started our day off on the right foot!  I had the cheddar and bacon omelette and my daughter got her kid size waffles and fruit!  The strawberry and basil lemonade was refreshing and my coffee was satisfying.  My potatoes were just the way I like them, bite size pieces, crispy on the outer and tender on the inner.  My daughter finished everything on her plate, not usual.  I'd come back again for sure!  Thanks Stoli for the great service and food!",

    "text": "My buddies and I were looking for breakfast outside of our hotel after putting back a few drinks the night before. We were going to hit the Denny's on the Strip, but the line was absurdly long and we had to be somewhere later that morning, so we popped into the Hard Rock Cafe since we saw that they had a breakfast menu.  We went upstairs to the restaurant and were promptly seated out on the patio which has a great view of the Strip. It was another gorgeous day in Vegas and the sun was starting to really heat things up.  We started the meal off in a very manly way - mimosas and cocktails. I wasn't originally going to get a big breakfast, but the chicken and biscuits were too tempting.   A short wait later, our food arrived and it was apparent that the kitchen just thought I had ordered a biscuits and gravy as my chicken was quite absent. After waving down a waiter, he said he would take it back to the kitchen and get the chicken. Unfortunately, fried chicken isn't the quickest thing to get done on the fly, so by the time my plate came back, my friends were already done eating. Our waitress was great though, and was actually getting ticked off that the food was taking so long to come back.   When it did finally arrive, it looked quite good with a good-sized piece of chicken on two country gravy-slathered biscuits. The golden brown batter was nice and crunchy, although the boneless chicken breast had a texture suggesting that it came from a freezer. The gravy was rich and hearty but the biscuits weren't so much the dense but flaky texture of a good biscuit, but closer to that of cake. It was odd. Not bad, just odd.  My buddy whose birthday it was received a complimentary birthday sundae and a free glass as well, which was really cool, and the waitress knocked $5 off our bill for all the hassle. All in all, she was a champ.  The food was kinda meh, but its a great location and the front end service was spot on. Swing on by, just not for the  biscuits.",

    "text": "We came here on a whim because they were offering 20% off with our rock in rio wristbands. We've been to others and this is right up there as probably the best. Walk upstairs and get your picture taken and wait for your table to be prepared. We waited 5 minutes on a Friday afternoon in Vegas! I think that's bad ass.   We had some cocktails which were delicious and we ordered a burger and sampler appetizer. It was so much food we left 25% of it there. So much flavors and options to choose from had us stuffed. Our booth had its own personal TV to watch the music videos that wee synced with the in house music and we thought that was sweet because some of them were live performances. The picture you take at the beginning is not free, 20 bucks for 3 sizes but hey it Vegas right? You get nickel and dimed everywhere so that's not surprising.   We did not buy anything from the gift shop but they have hard rock memorabilia such as t shirts, mugs, sweaters, etc.",

The decor was dark and modern, with art on the walls.  Maybe a couple of hundred people attended, yet the space was comfortable - the temperature was never too hot or too cold, and I never felt it was crowded. It was easy to get to different areas, like the bar, dance floor and major seating areas. The covered balcony overlooking Las Vegas Blvd was a nice spot to see the bustling street, and floor to ceiling windows meant we didn't have to go outside to see the Strip.   The dance floor was pretty decent- great lighting and a stage for the DJ. I thought the sound system was pretty good.  I'd definitely come here again for a party!",

    "text": "Forget what you know about the Hard Rock Cafe in (insert city here). Go to the new one on the strip and prepare to have your music loving mind blown!  I stopped by just a couple of days after what was the \"soft opening\".  My server says a big grand opening event will happen in October and Chris Cornell will perform.  More on that later.  This has to be the biggest and most detailed Hard Rock anywhere.  According to the staff it's been in the works for four years and it shows.  It's prime location on the strip is just the start.  Once you walk in you'll get a number that directs you to the second or third level dining areas.  I got level 3 which features a huge split level dining hall, full size bar and a small intimate stage for live acts at the back of the room. (see Chris Cornell above). The number of mouths this place can feed at a time is huge at more than 800 seats.  Just imagine the kitchen on a busy night!  The food is the same menu at any Hard Rock.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was a lot better than expected, especially the bacon.  Pricing at 13 bucks is a little high but you are on the strip and at the best HRC ever built.  It would be nice if the drink menu included pricing.  It was relatively slow when I was there.  And since all the staff is new they are eager to please and clearly instructed to go for the upsell.  After the meal you can just roam around and that's where it gets really fun.  The path to the third floor restroom is lined with infamous and at times chilling news headlines of the deaths of Lennon, Elvis and both Kennedys.  On a lighter note, a special room is dedicated to wedding memorabilia.  Elvis and Priscilla, John and Yoko, Ike and Tina and my heart skipped a beat when I came across a signed acoustic from Kurt Cobain at the Kurt and Courtney section.  Another awesome moment was a drum set from White Zombie mounted on the wall as you go down the stairs.  Another thing that makes this place unique is all the interactive technology.  Lots of Microsoft Surface tables and a huge touchscreen wall where you can check out everything that's on site.  If this doesn't become the flagship HRC soon I will be shocked.  Anyone who loves music (anyone with a pulse) needs to grab a meal or drink here.",

I touched my bacon, cold, then lifted up my burger and touched the middle, cold, not even luke warm.  Not cool at all, but I am not a whiny complaining person and I didn't want someone's spit in my burger if I sent it back so I just ate it.  Hubby's burger was cold too, I didn't touch it so I can't comment on whether or not it was lukewarm or like mine.  Our waitress was ok, took a while for her to come to our table when we first sat down, she seemed very busy.  The place was semi busy on a Saturday night.  We got seated right away and the restaurant was very clean.  If I came back, it wouldn't be by choice, I will stick with the Hard Rock location on Harmon and Paradise.

We got to Tuesday Blend pretty darn early around 10 to where there were no people on the dance floor or anything, so I basically persuaded/pushed my boyfriend to go downstairs and go get some appetizers/food just to kill time and also because we never tried it. So we went downstairs and the staff was so friendly. Passing through Hard Rock, the restaurant always looks nice on the outside, but actually sitting and being there was a lot nicer than I expected. I wanted to sit at the bar because I assume that's always the quickest service, but we actually got a window seat, which was perfect... better than the bar area and we just people watched. We got quick service with a nice waiter with funny and nice coworkers who all seemed to get along very well, which is good for them and the job itself. Anyhow we ordered two burgers. I don't remember the name, but I believe my boyfriend got something mushroom(?) and I got something jalapeno(?), but it was so delicious. The meat was cooked perfect! The meat wasn't hard like some other restaurants and it didn't taste like it was right out of the freezer or anything. It tasted so fresh and so juicy. Food was good. Customer service was cool. Environment/atmosphere was chill. Window seat was amazing. If we ever go to Tuesday Blend again, I wouldn't be surprised if we stopped by the restaurant again. :)",

Our waitress was really nice and had a good and appropriate sense of humor. She was very easy to chit-chat with and answered all my questions about Vegas.  We had some drinks, nachos and greek salad. All were solid. The bill was gut-wrenching though... $100+ for not a lot of stuff. But it was vacation and it's Vegas, so no biggie!",

    "text": "I recently stayed at the Aria on a family trip to Las Vegas. I took my parents here for our last dinner. I think it was the best meal that we got our money while on The Strip.  Pros -Our waitress was a superstar. She was ridiculously friendly and positive, even with my gloomy Asian father. She came to check up on us at least every 10 minutes, and never let our glasses get half empty. I don't give a lot of 20% tips, but I didn't need to think twice about this one. -Entertainment at the table! We were seated at a booth, and attached to the wall was a touch-screen that let you could flip through musical memorabilia and look at anything from Britney Spears' waitress getup in her Crazy video to the local newspaper after Lennon's death. -The music, of course! I feel pretty odd commenting on this obvious aspect, but the music was loud enough for me and not too loud for my parents. -$4 for my Groupie Grind! Recommended to me by my waitress. Pina colada mix with mango and strawberry puree. MMMMmmmmm...Oh, for some odd reason there were no prices on the drink menu. I was surprised when I saw the check that my fabulous slushie was just $4 and my mom's fountain drink (I think she got Sierra Mist) was something like $3.50. Moral of the story: Treat yourself to a special drink! -Beer battered Fish n Chips. I don't even like fish, but it was so darn crispy that we all stole some of mom's food.  Just OK: -Cobb salad. A typical and ordinary Cobb salad. Enough to fill me up, but didn't leave me feeling overstuffed. IMO, a good dish if you're not famished and you want to leave a little room to try other foods. I was also eyeing the Anti-Cobb, so maybe I'll try that next time.  Cons: -They make you take a picture with a drum set and guitars when you come in. Fun if you're going with friends, awkward when you're there with your already uncomfortable Asian parents.  Overall: Great service, great atmosphere, good prices and generous portions. If you're stuck on The Strip, this is one of your better options for food.",

It was way too cold to sit outside when we were there, but I can see giving it a go in April or May, or perhaps on a summer evening.    Everything else seemed to be the same as all the other HRC's.  The food rarely disappoints.  On this particular occasion, DH and I shared the appetizer sampler platter.  The emphasis on trying to sell merchandise to diners is a little annoying - and half the specialty drinks seem to be an automatic \"pay extra to keep the glass\" deal.   Not wanting to schlep a glass on the airplane, I selected one of the other drinks and it was disappointingly weak, yet expensive.  Should've just avoided the specialty menu and ordered some standard thing.  As for the music, it should've been called \"The Generally Fairly Mellow Rock Cafe\" - to us, a bit of a disappointment.  Maybe it's more rockin' late at night if the one in Tahoe is any guide.",

Walked into this place and it's a shopping area downstairs and there's an escalator that leads upstair to the restaurant and that's where we intended to go anyway. Right on top of the stairs, there was a guy there who took photos of anyone who goes to the restaurant. We got seated right away and because of our time crunch, we already knew what we wanted. I ordered a Grilled Alaskan Salmon and hubby got the Jumbo Combo. Both food was very good especially the mash potatoes that game with my dish. They made it with cheese or something similar. It was very cheesy. My husband's dish was huge or jumbo in this case. Service was great and the decor was very rocker chique. I will come back next time but not on such a time crunch. After getting the bill they give you a coupon to shop downstairs. Pretty cool.",

    "text": "I'd give it half a star if I could, and that would be for the atmosphere.  We had a party of 11 (including 3 kids), on a Sunday afternoon.  So they weren't very busy.  Our server was polite, but after ordering it took an hour to get our food.  I ordered the brisket sandwich.  The first bite was all fat, turned out the entire sandwich was all fat, and inedible.  My father in law order chicken nachos, no tomatoes (he can't eat them).  They came covered with tomatoes so he sent them back for the beef nachos, again stated no tomatoes to the same server.  When he finally got them, surprise, more tomatoes.  Combine that with messed up orders and undercooked burgers for the rest of our party, and we were pretty unhappy.  The server brought over the manager, Tim or Ted or something (medium build white guy with a shaved head).  At the table he was all \"right, of course, of course, I understand.\". And offered us deserts on the houseto make up ffor the issues, so we ordered desert to try and salvage the experience.  He also promised to take the messed up items off the menu.  When we got the bill we found out they had charged us for everything, including the complimentary deserts, and took a flat $100 off the bill (original total of about $250).  When I confronted the manager one on one about the bill (the deserts we were charged for, and the flat $100,taken off), he became confrontational and said it wasn't his job to go through the check item by item and take things off.  When I offered to sit down with him and do it for him, he said \"if you want to go through item by item and argue over 14 cents, that's up to you.\". He then assured me there was no one above him to speak to and walked off.  We paid our bill because we are not the type to walk out on a check, and our server got a $10 pitty tip.  I will never go back there, especially with guests from out of town, and I will never recommend it to anyone.  Please save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "We are in Vegas for the first time and naturally, we wanted to eat at Hard Rock Cafe. We  signed in OK, when our pager light up, we went up to the hostess stand expecting to be seated.  No, that was just to tell us to stand in a different spot. I have a hard time standing so I had given up my seat while waiting, If we knew we had to wait again, I would have stayed where I was!! Then we passed up several empty tables and booths to be seated in the back by the kitchen.  They then took forever before our waiter came over and another 30 minutes to get our sodas and lemonade. Then it was an hour before we got our food.  At one point, our waiter did come over and we were talking to him and the people at the next table called him and he turned around and waited on them.  We were mid sentence and he left us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was so incredibly rude!!!!  Then when the other table left and they were cleaning off the table, the busboy stacked the glasses so high that the bottom glass shattered from the pressure.  There was glass all over and they only cleaned up part of it, my husband was trying to point out more glass and they obviously DID NOT like it being pointed out.  So he got up to go find the manager and told him what all was going on. He did come by our table for about 2 seconds and said he would go check on our food. That obviously upset the kitchen.  One son ordered a BBQ bacon burger and it was so dry and bland (no BBQ sauce on it and burger itself was dry and flavorless) that he could not eat.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it also was dry! I only ate about a quarter of it. My other son is usually ravenous and eats anything. I gave him half of my sandwich and he only took 1 bite and said no thanks.  Anyway, that gives you an idea of what we thought of the food.  And the table with the broken glass, well we kept pointing out where more glass was and they finally finished cleaning BUT there was still more broken glass under the table.  I hope that whoever sits at that table with sandals on and cuts there foot sees this so they know it was pure negligence on the part of the restaurant!!!!",

    "text": "First, the food I had here was AMAZING.  My burger was SOOOOO good.  The problem was the service.  We went here for lunch on a weekday, probably around 11am (it was early and lunch had just started).  We were STARVING, which is why we were eating on the strip in the first place.  There were only three tables, including us.  The place was pretty much empty.  After being seated with menus, we were deserted.  We did not see another employee for at least 20 minutes, and when we managed to flag him down and ask where our server was (I mean, it's not like they were busy), he said that he'd go get our server.  It was a while later before the server finally showed up to take our order.  Again, we were starving.  After ordering, it happened all over again.  We thought that, surely, after leaving us with NO service after being seated they'd be attentive and get our order through fast.  (Still, only about three tables were seated, including us).  Boy were we wrong!  Our orders took FOR EVER.  A table that had arrived about ten minutes after us paid their bill and left about ten minutes before the food ever showed up.  I haven't experienced that kind of wait at any restaurant on a busy night on the strip ever.  After having to hunt down our food, we finally ate and our server apologized for the delay.  We were very dissatisfied and when he brought the bill he said he'd apply his employee discount to make up for the bad service, but that was all he could do.  His discount was 5%.  Meh.  It was pretty expensive anyway (being on the strip) and little that discount didn't really rectify much.  Also, I figure places like these usually have coupons or gift cards or something to give out in a situation like this and we didn't get anything like that.  The only reason this is two stars instead of one is that 1) the food was insane and 2) at least the server made some kind of tiny effort to acknowledge our bad experience by giving the slight discount.  But I still can't get what the delay was.  Maybe their server was also the chef.  And the hostess.  And the bartender.  And the janitor.  And the guy out front entertaining pedestrians...",

    "text": "This was my first time at this H.R. location.  Will I go back?  probably not as there are so many options on the strip with better food.  The ambiance is outstanding, as is the sound system, but the quality of the food left quite a bit to be desired.  I visited with my wife.  She ordered a BBQ plate and I ordered the New York strip steak ($27.95).  While my wife's meal came out fine, mine was barely warm.  The mashed potatoes were cold and stiff, the gravy congealed and the green beans cold and hard.  I normally don't send food back because I've heard all of the horror stories, but I couldn't stand the thought of paying this much for a barely tolerable meal, so back it went.  I will say that the server and management were spot on though -- the server apparently notified the manager who came to my table to apologize and offered me a salad to keep me busy while waiting for a new meal.  When the 2nd meal arrived, it was much better.  The cut of beef was not quite as tender as I'd like for a N.Y. strip, but it had good flavor.  I just wish that there was an option for a baked potato rather than mashed potatoes, but alas - there were no baked potatoes to be found on the menu.  All in all, dinner came out to a little over $70 for two -- but the ambiance made up for what the food quality lacked.  You have to pay for parking too an it's not validated.",

My boyfriend and i popped in one day for lunch, and we both loved it.   The restaurant is filled with music memorabilia, and has instruments on display.   The staffs were extremely helpful, and definitely went above and beyond to make sure you had a great lunch. The food was delicious, but the portions were massive, i left quite a bit because i just couldn't fit it in.   Hard Rock is located just off the strip, but is very easy to get too. We took a taxi, but i'm sure you could walk it.",

I was pretty impressed. The decor is pretty hip, just like the casino itself. They had a separate menu for some specials they had. We ended up ordering from that menu. For an appetizer we have bacon wrapped jalapeno's. I thought this was gonna be a run of the mill popper, but it was actually a whole jalapeno stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. It was AMAZING! And super spicy, which is how I like it! For dinner, I had the filet mignon and asked to add on blue cheese, which was not a problem at all. It was super good. My boyfriend got the fish n' chips, which is odd cause he hates seafood, but he enjoyed it. The drinks are kind of pricey, but hey, it's the strip so it's not uncommon. My friend gave us a deal on the food, which even sweetened the whole dinner!",

    "text": "I've been to the Hard Rock for three different types of experiences: dining, special event, and concert. This is definitely a world class Hard Rock Cafe. From the interactive screens at the lobby, and select tables, to the decor and the staff.   The food is pretty consistent, and they have good options for those with dietary restrictions.   As a local, I found the staff to be very accommodating to both locals and tourists. I witnessed the staff giving genuine recommendations to tourists, and joking around with the occasional local that stops by.   Beyond the typical HRC experience, I've been very impressed with the concert venue on the top floor. I've seen both international acts and local acts in the concert hall. During concerts the venue is very intimate, and there is not a bad seat (mostly standing room, but you get the idea) in the house save the area behind the bar that overlooks the strip.   The sound is good, not the best I've seen, but for the type of venue it is more than adequate.   I look forward to concerts at the HRC because the parking is easy (just park in the Showcase mall, you have to pay, but it is worth it), and you can always see the band. The security can be a little hardcore (patting down kids at an all ages show), but as far as small venues go on the Strip, this one is outstanding.",

Of course, growing up in WNY, Orlando is the most popular place that families seem to vacation, .... so it seemed that almost everyone owned an Orlando HRC T-shirt. And boxer shorts. We were so cool.  But not my BFF. She scored a Las Vegas one, and I was secretly jealous.  Fifteen plus years later, and I had to have lunch here for memory's sake. The restaurant is rather large, and was pretty crowded for a late Saturday afternoon. A friend and I scored bar seats, and within a minute or two had the bartenders attention. The holiday drink menu looked intriguing, but when I asked his recommendation, he said he wasn't too impressed and could make me a fantastic raspberry martini, after a few questions as to what type of drinks I enjoyed. It was delish.  Our entrees (pulled pork and chix mac & cheese) were delivered rather quickly. Sizeable, yet manageable portions, and very tasty.  Overall a very positive experience. Enjoyed chatting with our bartender about the local MTB scene, and will have to return for another matini. Will probably not be purchasing any more T-shirts though. The coolness factor has worn off.",

Not only was our waitress phenomenal, informed, helpful and friendly, the manager even came by and had very personable, genuine conversation. We had Four adults and four kids, including two infants, and yet they still treated us like stars (yay!) They brought out a huge dessert after we had paid, just because. ?! I've never seen something like that. Oh, and one of my kids wanted an egg to eat, and they actually just fried up one (which wound up being three, I think) for her. A lot of places won't do that (sad, but True.)  So I'll spare you the description since I'm sure most people are aware of what Hard Rocks are like, but you can definitely count on great service and good food (the kids meals were fantastic too.) With all the potentially horrendous tourist experiences in Vegas, this is a sure bet. Highly, highly recommended!!",

I am not really complaining, because I have underage friends, but still... it was kind of funny.  There were 2 guards in particular who were constantly checking Kalila for a 21+ wristband even after she had repeated showed it to him so many times.  The venue served its purpose and we had a good time, but that was thanks to the people who came out and our friends who produce the event. As far as I'm concerned the HRC was a good sized venue with annoying security (except for the guy next to the escalators downstairs -- he was cool).",

Seating was quick and easy, our waitress was okay, but not sure if the whole place was ready to go, and i heard they opened a few weeks before, not sure if it was True or not, but some of those waiters were not all there.  Anyhow, the salad alone took forever to get to our table, and it arrived two minutes before our meals arrived, which is not cool, we need to enjoy the salad atleast half way before our meal gets there.  Had their Twisted Mac,Chicken & Cheese, and i was not disappointed at all, good lunch.  Just like any Hard Rock Cafe, the feel and your surroundings are Cool.  Hope to stop in again once i am in Las Vegas.",

An arugula salad ($15) and a club sandwich ($12). Not sure why the salad was more than the sandwich - maybe because it was healthy?  The dining room is spacious and clean, and I would rate it an A. As always, I check the bathrooms. If they are filthy it's likely the kitchen is to. In this case I would give them a C on the bathroom since it was small, cramped, and cluttered. It could use a cleaning.  I had to wait 10 min to get refills on my water, which is unacceptable, particularly since I told the server I would be drinking a lot of water due to the heat.   That said, the food was the best part of the visit. It was delicious. The club sandwich was typical, but there was plenty of it. It was accompanied by a small side of cole slaw which was a little dry. It also was served with crisp fries.",

Store on bottom level with all kinds of Hard Rock merchandise. You have to leave down a staircase that exits through this store. It's like Disney World when you exit a ride. They lure you in to suck money from your wallets on all kinds of shirts and souvenir items.   It's near the World of Coca Cola and not anywhere near the Hard Rock Casino which does confuse people. It's right on the Strip. Was here recently for a client sponsored event. Tons of free food (bbq chicken, salads, mac & cheese, dessert station, etc) that were actually pretty tasty. Seems like the food is pretty decent here. Spacious stage area and concert floor. Cool memorabilia and posters on the walls. Large bar area with a nice selection of tap and canned/bottled beer.  I drank Dos Equis all night on the balcony overlooking the neon lights of the Strip and felt like The Most Interesting Man In The World!",

First of all they only feature 4 different burgers and each burger is like $20.  I ordered the Kimchi Burger and the finace ordered the Jambalaya burger.  The Kimchi burger failed to impress me.  It was described to have a bulgogi patty topped with kimchi.  The burger had no flavor.  The patty definitely did not taste anything like bulgogi.  It was bland.  The Jambalaya burger was was good.  The toppings made it good but again the patty was flavorless.  Overall I was not impressed with the food.... but Hard Rock Cafe management, thank your server Kyle for that extra star since it was his polite and attentive service that pushed my review up to three stars because the food WAS NOT $66.00 good.",

Dear James' Manager,  our server went to you for approvals on the multiple mistakes that were made.  It was on different occasions and they all took some time.

It has less rock memorabilia on its walls than the HRC adjacent to the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise, but is more elegant, plus features a dynamite second level patio overlooking other Strip properties, and a large third floor suitable for concerts.  But I was here to try the vaunted HRC hamburger, and was not let down by the 6 oz. Classic Burger with bacon and Cheddar Cheese added, and accompanying fries.  This was the small variety of burger, but it was large enough for me.    Although it took awhile to get made medium rare as ordered, once my sandwich arrived it was a fine burger.  Deconstructing its contents, it consisted of cold pickle chips, a good slice of ripe red tomato, green leafy lettuce, Red Onion circles, a warm charbroiled hamburger patty, a soft bready bun, very tasty bacon, and nicely melted orange Cheddar Cheese.  The fries were neither thin nor fat, and tasted just fine with the juicy Bacon Cheeseburger.  Service was friendly and professional.  It was an enjoyable lunch in a very cool setting, and I look forward to a return visit.",

We all chose this restaurant out of all the restaurants on the strip. Everything was good but not until I noticed a small squirmy worm on my cheese. I got the California Cobb Salad and not until I was almost done with my salad I noticed the worm! Should of taken a pic but I was so disgusted I wanted out of my sight right away! A waiter passed by and we showed him my plate with the worm and he casually says \"oh yeah once in a while they'll get in\" like what!!??? Like if it's no big deal! They did call management and they offered free dessert which by that time I had no space for nothing! Our bill was over $160 and all they did was take $25 out of the bill!! Really really disappointed!!!!!!",

As a new Vegas local I have had the privilage to attend many shows at many different venues in this wonderful city. Last nights show (Lords Of Acid) 3/27/19 was the worst run event I have ever had the displeasure to attend, and I will not be back... and here is why.  I know you pay to park down here, and I was fine with that. $20 bucks.  I know that strip prices are a gouge because thats what they do. I too was fine with it. Tall boy beers were 10 bucks, and the mixed drinks were more, and again Im fine with that.  What im not fine with, is paying this money, then getting a 10 dollar PBR, a insanly priced mixed drink for the wife from the bar, to be told I have to stay in the bar area because its a all ages show. Security would not let us go into the floor to get close to the stage because we had drinks in our hands..... So lets get this straight, Im buying over priced beer and spirits, and I cant even get close to the stage because im buying over priced beer and spirits. Thats a deal breaker and will not be back.  If you want to do all ages shows, you should put the non paying rug rats in a section and let the paying adults get what they actually paid for. What a crappy night. This is not how you do shows. Maybe you guys should check with House of Blues about how to do all ages shows. Seriously.",

The beans were nearly raw, and the nachos lacked overall flavor. Should definitely focus on quality over quantity...  The flatbread was good. It doesn't look like a lot of food but it sure fills you up! The flavor was good and had a nice crunch.   Would not recommend this location. Needs work.",

The decor; from Amy Winehouse's pink dress, MC Hammer's famous \"Hammer Time\" outfit, Frank Sinatra's gold plated microphone, to Madonna's toy encrusted bustier, are just a few of the many memorabilia's to admire @ the cafe! Wherever you are seated, music history will be around you!   We sat in one of the spacious booth seating across from the bar. Musician, Justin Carder had the crowd singing along with him while he performed famous cover songs from different artists. His voice was stunning! The noise level was also perfect which made it even much more enjoyable. There is no need to shout for anyone to hear you. ;)   The modern bar area with talented mixologists, offers a scenic view of the strip with bar seating and lounge area. Patio dining is also available depending on the weather. On this trip, it was bbbbrrrr cold and windy.  Now let's talk food. I've been to several Hard Rock Cafes and have only experienced mediocre tasting dishes from their \"Authentic American Cuisine\" menu. But to each is own. We ordered the Jumbo Bruschetta classic for our appetizer, the Twisted Macaroni and Cheese with grilled chicken and the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich. For a party of 4, it was plenty, but again, average in taste. On the other hand, our waitress Rachelle was outgoing and deserves kudos for her exemplary service!   Overall, leave the gambling aside for a bit. Relax, enjoy the great atmosphere, the history of music and the vibes at the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas.",

Per usual if I can't decide I would of course go with someone that is familiar with what the food taste like. I was stuck in between the Twisted Mac and cheese and the Southwest Flatbread pizza. She was so in love with the flatbread so the decision was made. Let's rock out with the \"healthier\" option, the flatbread! SOUTHWEST CHICKEN FLATBREAD Crispy flatbread with grilled chicken, pico de gallo, diced red peppers, green onion, avocado, mozzarella, and a slightly spicy chipotle aioli. (1525 cal)  20 minutes later here comes this amazing pizza that hits the table, I couldn't wait to indulge. It was one of those mmmmmm it could better, but it's not the worse I've eaten.   Fast forward, almost 24hours I'm throwing up and having stomach issues. Word of advice HRC do better. Something so easy to cook shouldn't have someone living in the restroom for 6 hours.",

We were seated right away during the busy brunch hour and our server Laura...well we fell in love with her warmth and charming personality.  All that justifies the cost of the meals.    Take a gander at all the great outfits worn by anyone of your favorite Rock Stars.  Rock music is a dying breed and its nice to see places like HRC pay tribute to the best of the best.  Don't forget to grab a souvenir or tee on the way out.  The styles are always changing and they totally scream Rock God (or Goddess).",

    "text": "I decided to give the Hard Rock Cafe another try, this time we just went in for dinner before going to a concert. I made a reservation for 6:30 and this time, we took a cab from our hotel so the lack of free, easy to access parking was a non-factor.  Upon arrival we headed up the escalator and was greated by a photographer. She handed me a guitar, we struck some rockstar poses while she snapped a couple shots. Then it was off to get seated.   Our hostess was friendly and tried to make small talk while she took us to our table. The eating area of the Hard Rock Cafe was almost identical to the club area, which is one floor up. The only differences I saw were the additional tables, and different memorabilia.   Our waitress was friendly and we were able to place orders for drinks quickly after being seated. My husband decided to order the pulled pork and ribs combo plate, I had a sirloin steak. When we ordered, the waitress gave him a choice in the sauces for the pulled pork, he went with vinegar.  After placing our food order, someone came by with the photo that had been taken when we entered. $20 later we had a 5x7 in a simple, touristy frame and 2 smaller photos. Pretty gimmicky but a nice way to remember the evening.  Food was brought out promptly. Not too fast but fast enough. I tried a little of the pulled pork, I was glad my husband went with the vinegar based sauce. Very tasty. He seemed to really enjoy the ribs as well.  My steak was fine, nothing exceptional.  I really did like that it was served with snap peas though.   Overall, a better experience then my first visit. Food was  good, a little on the pricier side but nothing we weren't expecting. Not really a place I think I'd feel the urge to return to often though. Maybe when people visit from out of town...",

The first time was amazing with an amazing waiter named Terry, who did bar tricks for us and catered to our ever need, even to our friend who has trouble making decisions and embarrasses us! Only downside was the prices.  The second time? I don't think I will ever go back. We had a waitress named Amy, with a high pitched and shrill voice, who forgot our drinks numerous <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimes.As&s=7ceefe7c6080fc325135d9e27d1d6c0d8cd5871adecd05b9898ef68dc14f00d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">times.As</a> well as trying to be a bit too friendly, stealing one of my prize stuffed animals to my side and saying I should watch better...very comforting to know that my stuff could be stolen from me as I eat. Yes, she was nice and ok as a waitress I guess...but once it came to the bill, it said \"We added an 18% optional tip for your convenience\". The tip was going to be 25 dollars...we decided 15 would be good enough.  As we left, she ran after us saying we \"were a bit shy\" from the amount due, We gladly pointed out that the tip was optional, but it seems Ms. Amy was NOT happy about it. \"I aim for 20%\" That's fine, but you didn't get it. She got mad and said she needed to talk to the manager before we left. This got us very angry, because she treated us like thieves or something.  She then came back 10 mins later saying \"We can go\". Well, if I would have known she'd be pissy about a tip I'd have taken the tip back.",

    "text": "I went here with a group of friends because we were going to a concert there (Metal Elvis, meh). We weren't expecting much but were seduced by the convenience of eating at the same place as the show.  The first problem was that one person in our group made a reservation online, but they had no record of it when we got there, despite our having a confirmation number. So, we had to wait for a table.  The next problem is that the Mint Julep I had was probably 90% simple syrup. Truly an awful cocktail (not to mention that the waitress had no idea what kind of bourbon they had).  The service was slow. Some manager type came by and gave us some kind of locals only frequent member card. Not enough for everyone, mind you. Which was fine by me because I hate that kind of crap. Don't need another card to carry around.  The group shared a plate of nachos which were OK. Kind of hard to screw up corn chips and cheese, so kudos to the Hard Rock for that.  The special that night was a portabello mushroom sandwich, which seemed to be a reasonably healthy alternative to everything else on the menu. But it was so slathered in cheese and this obnoxious mayo concoction that it really was as much a greasy, drippy mess as any burger. Came with a salad but most of the \"vegetables\" were white, so that was a disappointment, let me tell you.  Went in suspecting that the Hard Rock Cafe is nothing more than a tourist trap and everything about it confirmed this suspicion.",

So we walked in the store and up to the second level where we were greeted and taken a picture of that would later be offered for us to buy... They seated us quickly which was nice since the place looked pretty busy for a tuesday afternoon.  I tried not to get seduced just by the nice decor and the great music, but i couldnt help it, the music was great. Our waiter was a super cool/nice guy that came and sat with us as he took our order. My friend was hesitant as to what to order and he suggested The Texan sandwich, my friend loved it! I ordered the simple burger which was good, we got a LOT of fries as well, i couldnt finish my meal.  The place is not expensive, the food is decent, the waiters are helpful and fun, and the music just sets the whole ambiance, if you like rock that is. I can honestly say they changed my mind and i would come here again.",

I recently had dinner there, and stayed for a club that was being promoted by some hip hop dj's, which was on the 3rd floor.    The food at the hard rock is not bad.  By not bad I mean it taste like most chain restaurants, so stick to the salads and burgers, you don't want to venture out there too far.  The club was a beauty.  I loved the layout.  Nice bar.  Excellent outdoor patio overlooking the strip.  Clean restroom.  Plenty of space to dance.  I went Saturday Night, and the crowd was small for a Saturday, however, it was big enough to party and not feel like the place was empty.  I liked the idea of being in a club in Vegas with good music, yet not being cattled around like most clubs on the strip.  I believe with the right promotion this place could be one of the hottest spots on the strip for a club (especially since Poetry aka OPM is no longer open).",

I was a bit nervous trying something different cause the burgers always hit the spot but our waitress was raving about the new Brisket sandwich, it was absolutely fantastic. It was full of flavor with a small side of baked beans, really good. My wife also tried something different, she got the baby arugula salad which she loved! It was huge with sliced chicken and a nice mixture of veggies. We were very happy that we tried the new items. Just a week ago we dropped in for dinner and had some room for dessert. The staff mentioned that the Banana Split was awesome so we ordered it and WOW! It was delicious! We were not expecting that, the presentation was great! Definitely the best Banana split we have had. To top it off the service at HRC is first class, from hosts, waitresses to servers all the way up to Management, I've interacted with them all and they do a really a good job of providing excellent service. Can't forget the (( MUSIC! )) Always cool watching some throwback music videos and grubbin! Hard Rock Rocks!",

So I was with a friend and knower this location was still open and around the corner from movie theater in which we were planning on going to after lunch. Missy was our server. She didn't really seem to care about my order and rushed me very quickly thru my very specific order. I do have dietary restrictions and those need to be requested not disrespected or ignored. I was in a pardy of 2 and asked to be seated outside. The furniture needs to be replaced cus it looks like the chairs are covered with bird poop. When ordering my cauliflower burger I specifically asked for everything on the side and raw. This means everything. Also when even asked for extra onions it was like a total inconvenience me god forbid that I asked what kind of fries it comes with. Just trying to communicate with her was a burden. The burger as pictured cam the way it did, and not together when trying to move it. When arrived the cheese was mysteriously melted and the look on my face was not good. If she cared at all she would have a nice it back before delivering food, but did not. I was disappointed and told running server who corrected the situation. When mentioned to Missy what was wrong she looked at me and said Oh good and walked away. My friend sitting across from me was dumbfounded at the odd answer.     The melted cheese looks so nasty like human waist and it was melted into burger, ripping the burger as pictured. I even mentioned I was not happy with the way the sandwich came out and told her the running is taking care of issue and got the odd answer. She's more like a truck driver and no customer service.    Fries were not gourmet and just steak fries with salt n pepper, don't wait your money",

The food came out fast and was absolutely delicious.  I had the Original Legendary Burger, my husband had the pulled pork sandwich.  They give plenty of fries and we left fuller than full.  We also got specialty drinks.  They don't list prices of those on the menu... and we found out they are pretty pricey (around $14 each) but very tasty.  The second time we came it was during the regular dinner service.  It was busy and our server wasn't around much.  Food was still pretty good though.",

Yet, I get a Hardrock Cafe tshirt at each location that I've been.   If you like buffalo wings, then make sure you get some from here before you leave Vegas. You won't be disappointed.

She really made the experience positive by going above and beyond. She checked on us multiple times. And even was very fast with our food. Loved it. Thanks to you Lauren",

If you don't like large venues, this is a great spot.  There is a large bar just as you enter, with plenty of seating and a large patio, overlooking the Strip.  The staff is friendly and prices aren't horrible.  My only knock is that this place is obviously marketed towards tourists, based on it's location alone.  They don't really have their own parking, so if you are a local and going to a show, you could park at the Showcase Theater garage, or across the street at Monte Carlo.  Even the MGM garage isn't too far of a walk, but none are particularly convenient.  Anyhow, I've seen a couple of shows on my radar, so hopefully I will stop in again soon.",

We sat on the second floor patio, if it wasn't for the tv screens showing music videos you would not know it was the Hard Rock. But hey, the food was fine, it was exactly what I would expect at a Hard Rock Cafe. Although the serving size of side dishes left a lot to be desired. Look at my pictures and you'll see.  To eat my wife had a barbecue combo. She loved the juicy-ness of her meal.  I enjoyed \"The Texan... Chipotle and hickory bar-b-que sauce, cheddar cheese, crispy jalapenos and crispy onions... everything is bigger in texas! go big & make it a 10oz. bar-b-que sandwich for an additional charge\" Yeah I made it the 10oz.  Yes I copied those descriptions from the menu.  Las Vegas Boulevard is famous for people dressing up like celebrities, Elvis, Hello Kitty, and various super heroes are very popular. Take a picture with them if you want, but these people usually ask for a cash tip .  As my wife and I exited The Hard Rock Cafe, I immediately noticed that four people were dressed like members of the rock band KISS. Ace Frehley immediately noticed my tee shirt and pointed at it.  My wife and I continued to walk down the sidewalk. 3 or 4 times people pointed at my shirt and advised me that \"KISS\" was \"just over there.\"  Las Vegas... never boring.",

    "text": "My family and I decided after looking over the Hard Rock Cafes menu, to try it out for dinner. We went through a small part of the Hard Rock store to take an escalator to the second floor whereupon we were greeted by two friendly hostesses. We were fascinated with all of the rock memorabilia in large glass display cases and frames that lined the walls of the restaurant.  We were seated and given menus to look at. My daughter asked for a gluten free menu which was brought to her. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. She listened to my daughter's concerns with how the gluten free bun is toasted and she stated she would find out for her. She took our drink order and returned shortly with them. She explained that the gluten free bun is toasted separate and on a piece of parchment paper. She added that they wear gloves and take every precaution to ensure her food is not prepared in the same area as the other food. She also reported that every item on the gluten free menu is without gluten. My daughter ordered the pulled pork gluten free sandwich, with fries (fried in an fryer and oil separate from regular fried foods). It also came with coleslaw and baked beans. My husband and I ordered the appetizer platter that consisted of chicken tenders, chicken wings, egg rolls-southwestern style, bruschetta topped bread and onion ring. Three dips came with the platter: ranch dressing, honey mustard sauce and barbecue. Videos of a wide variety of artists plays in the restaurant. At our booth, there was a small screen where we watched the music videos.  It's a cool experience with yummy food and good service.  I highly recommend visiting Hard Rock Cafe if you haven't been. It was a great first visit. They also give a military discount-an added plus for anyone retired or active duty. The store also gives a military discount.  On the third floor, there is a huge bar area with an area for shows. There is a lot of memorabilia lining the walls as well. Definitely a must see.",

I hated all of it.  Makes me sad.  I had such high expectations of the place....  3.  Bad drink - No garnish n served just plain jane style.  We're at Hard Rock... Shouldn't things be awesome like the Brand name???    We've wanted to eat at Hard rock for years... Sad... NEVER go back!  ** Update...  Because we got a nice respectable reply we will go back!!!!",

    "text": "Bad part:    I arrived in Vegas and wanted to grab something good to eat since we had been on the road traveling all day. We went to Hard Rock Cafe since the food is typically really good regardless of the location. Well this location in Las Vegas on the strip is TERRIBLE!!! We were seated right away by a really nice hostess. Then we waited close to 10 mins for a server to come say hello and take our drink order. Mind you, the restaurant is practically empty on a Sunday afternoon at 3pm. By the time the server arrives, we placed the order for our drinks and food. The server took an order for 3 people but had to come back before in was put in the computer because she couldn't remember part of the order (since she didn't write it down). I'm pretty easy on servers since I was once one myself, but she wasn't great; nice but VERY below average service. OK.... the food arrives...and it is BAD! Like REALLY nasty. I ordered seasonal veggies and I received a stalk of soggy broccoli (see pic). The onion rings were super hard and burned. According to my husband the bread on his chicken club was hard and the chicken was super dry. Also the French fries were cold and hard/ burned (see pic). He said it reminded him of cafeteria food in elementary school. Maybe the chef and server today were the worse they have! Also, it was a hot day (107 degrees) so we were going through water fast. But I had to slow down once I realized there would be no refills from our server who forgot about us. This was quite disappointing experience which has never happened. This is a franchise....other locations....please come train them. I'm not sure if I would ever go back. Still thinking about it......  Good Part: My son liked his little kids meal but he is 7 so consider that part. I bought a super cute shirt (see pic).",

I have never had too many problems with the food and service but this time around, I was not very impressed.   The service was great but the burgers were really nothing special, especially for the price. I ordered the Big Cheeseburger that had a lot of cheese but it really did not wow me. The fries were just fries. I also asked if they offered a turkey burger and they did not, only a regular burger and a vegan option. I was fine with a beef burger but not one that was not all that great.  It was average and that is all she said...",

We ate outside which was nice, wasn't to hot out and it's shaded nicely. I got the BBQ burger and fries, it was pretty good no complaints. Though I wouldn't come to Vegas just for the deliciousness of this place its a good place to stop in and have a burger, away from all the high end eateries you can find all over town.",

It wasn't busy but I did see my server had 3 booths (including myself and my date), a large party and another 10 top sat shortly after myself. I kid you not it was about 5 to 7 minutes before I was greeted, and about 2 minutes after to receive my drinks. I did hear one of the tables complain about their greet time. Aside from the wait my waitress was very nice and initiated conversation.  The Hard Rock cafe's menu was lacking and didn't hold many promising or even intriguing items, but I get it-it's a basic bitch cafe. The only interesting thing was the beyond meat burger which did end up being good. Food came out fine (not fast by any means but arrived and the order was correct). Refills were needed, recognized and refilled slowly after some time.   Really I just wasn't impressed and I'd be curious to see how they handle an actual busy rush.",

The management is very welcoming and assists with any question you might have and are always happy to help.   I was recently back here on a last minute Vegas trip and came here looking for Woody because he has always treated us to a great time. He is above all else a bartender of the people. He always has new and fun drinks for us to try and every time they are incredible.  Unfortunately, he was not in on this specific day but were happy to come across someone new to us that was equally as great. Patrick and management felt bad that we came all the way there from Los Angeles looking for someone so they apologized with a round of drinks. It's not their fault at all but the level of compassion was amazing.  I'll continue to come here every time I visit Vegas without hesitation and I'll continue to spread the good word about this amazing establishment.",

Their maple butter was to die for!   Even at 8am, they had live music. The artist was fantastic. I don't know why he doesn't have a record deal yet! I ended up buying one of his self-produced CDs for $10. He was that good!  The restaurant is actually above the retail store (up an escalator). This way it overlooks the strip.

I liked it better when it was on Paradise and attached to the hard rock hotel. This one is upstairs, it's smaller and does not have much memorabilia. (where are all the costumes from the bands that played at their hotel??) It should be a showplace being in Vegas but the lack of room does not seem to allow for it. They should have put the neon guitar (from the other place) above the bar. Food is good. Service is good. Parking is dicey but it's there. Crowded streets but it's Vegas baby !",

Since this is the Las Vegas HRC I was expecting something with sparkle, glitter and an occasional jazz fingers.  So happy it didn't meet that expectation.  However, it remained in line with the numerous worth-mentioning experiences I've had from Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, Miami, California and others.    The food is normal American fare with signature burgers which appeals to a family friendly group.  There's nachos, pulled pork and other items to choose from if beef isn't your thing.  The waitress and other wait staff members were attentive and on point with suggestions and promoting their gift shop which I happen to be a HRC pin collector.  Not like the Star Wars or Comic Con die hard collectors who'll cut a bitch over thinking their a bit too fanatical over stuff but I do take pride in preserving and owning for personal pleasure the signature series pins and such.     I really enjoyed the visit here at the Las Vegas HRC and the employees really enjoy their jobs and ensure the guest enjoy their time there too.  If you haven't been then go.  The food is not out of this world.  It's as good as any local place you'd frequent because it's \"good\", affordable and has plenty of whiplash inducing artifacts from artist past and present enclosed in cases on the walls to oooo and ahhh about.",

    "text": "So this place managed to be the only breakfast place my sister an I hit up on our short vacation here.    I will say this... typical expensive Vegas strip pricing. Also, all the food wasn't very good.   I had gotten an egg white omelette which was OK but very simple with tiny diced tomatoes and a few sushi thin slices of avocado for 13 dollars. The fruit was fresh though which was appreciated.   My sister had gotten a simple egg scramble, wheat toast, and bacon combo. I swear they gave her the cheapest product they had in store. Powdered GROSS eggs. Microwaved super thin bacon. Toast was cold and delivered with the butter in the side so when you spread it on it didn't melt into it like toast should be!     They did comp my sister her eggs but also didn't correct us when we said they were definitely powdered.    It's OK here but I would search a little harder next time for food with more flavor.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch a few days ago with my sister at around 2:30pm and it was not busy. We agreed to be seated on the patio but was seated at a booth. We the told our waitress and she accommodated us to the patio. The patio gives a nice view of the strip, but it was hard to get in your seats. It took the waitress 15 minutes to order our drinks. It took her another 15 minutes to bring out mines but not my sister's. She placed my drink down, apologized, said she will be right back and hurried off to bring another person their drink. After 20 minutes of waiting and our waitress no where in sight we asked another waitress about our drink. We waited another 10 minutes for my sister's drinks bringing it a total of 1 hour without ordering food. At this time I was very frustrated at the service. When the waitress came back with the drinks, I asked for the bill. She was right back with the bill with in 5 minutes. The drinks were good. The Hard Rocking Mai Tai was delicious and strong. The drinks, view of the strip from the patio and still being hung over from an awesome vacation are the only reasons why this place receive a two. I am a naturally a tipper, but since the service was horrible I left $2. Upon walking out the door the waitress said out loud for everyone to hear  \"you left $2, oh well thanks for the tip\".",

Then another 20 mins for alcohol drinks... And then another 10 mins for my coffee. The food was awful. Eggs (if that's what you want to call them) had a very weird texture to them. If you ever spent time in the military you'll know what I mean. The service there was non existent. Grant it, there was 11 of us there but that should be no reason why the service was that bad. We asked for butter and the girl pretty much said, \"Well I'm pouring mimosas right now.\" Huh? Ooooooookkkkkkkaaaaaaayyyyyy... Man, don't tell them that the service could have been better cause they'll return with a whole lot of excuses and no ownership of what they could have done better for us. Got double charged for gratuity so I paid with cash which I never do but I felt that I didn't  want to spend another couple of hours there. So again I plead with you... AVOID BREAKFAST THERE AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!",

My husbands burger was overcooked as well. The only reason id come back is for the good drinks, and twisted mac n cheese, bravo on those 2 items.

However, I have been to the 3rd floor on a couple of occasions for special events, and I dig the clean, modern space. Plus, the floor to ceiling windows provide a breathtaking Vegas view if views of Vegas are your thing. It's weird because the building is not tall, but somehow the size of the windows creates a panorama that is impressive in its own way. The staff has always been helpful, and today, I got to sample some of the appetizer fare served buffet style, perhaps not doing it justice, but it was okay. Still, I am a fan. I would recommend at least grabbing a drink here, although I am not sure if the 3rd floor is normally open. In that case, find someone with a budget and host a party here! It's a great venue.",

I think she said \"rock on\" about 17 times during our meal.  At one point, she actually got into the \"superstar\" position tableside.  It was intense.  But anyway, I recommend the lettuce wraps--they were really good, but it was quite a large appetizer, so bring your appetite!  After that my friend ordered a steak w/ the twisted mac n cheese--she said the steak was REALLY good, but I only snuck bites of her delicious macaroni.  Amazing!!!  I had the grilled lemon caper chicken, and it was to die for!!  The chicken was really juice and well cooked, and the sauce on it was creamy and delicious.  The pasta that came with it was good as well.  My husband ordered the burger, and I ate most of that, too!  It was SO good!  You could tell it was good beef they were using.  Very, very good meal.  And his fries were good, too.  Not the highlight of the meal, but good nonetheless!!  Also, they had a promotion going on that if you brought your receipt downstairs and bought three t-shirts, you would get 20% off the bill.  Score!",

I should mention that it was pretty cold sitting outside at 7:30pm on a Thursday in October.  The weather was a little cooler than previous years and while it looks nice to set outside in the evening, if you are from Southern California be sure to bring a sweater.  An hour or so later, I had polished off the salad and it was a good time to grab a beer and watch the band for the night.  Definitely a great place to have an event at, enjoy some food, make some new friends at, and skip the club drama.",

We tried: Appetiser sampler - massive portion. Onion rings were very good, potato skins & wings were ok. Everything else was meh... Pull pork sandwich - surprisingly delicious BBQ trio - the chicken was amazing! smoky, grilled and so tender. The pull pork sandwich was good. Ribs were disappointing and dry Fries - Not bad. Mango Tango - pretty tasty and refreshing  Good for a quite bite and place to catch up since it is such a casual place with decent food.",

It has the clothes/retail store on the ground level and if you go up the stairs you have the cafe.   I love Hard Rock stuff, T-shirts, mugs, key rings ect...The clothes and retail items aren't really that expensive, BUT go upstairs and be prepared.  I got a Sandwich and coke and my wife got chicken strips and fries with an ice T. lets just say filling up the Envoy was cheaper.  If it's just to shop around this place is GREAT, as for food shoot over the road!! you'll love it there.  Cheers  GO HERE (not for the food though)",

Being from Portland, we had to explain to him that the show \"Portlandia\" is based off of how Portland really is, versus just silly jokes.  And since Vegas is such a tourist spot, we totally dig being asked where we're from and the person that asked RELATING versus just saying, \"Cool\" or something else to the degree of \"we don't care, we're just paid to ask.\"  Anyways, he seriously made our night. He was geniunely friendly, and just such a fun way to start off the meal.  The food was spendy for being nothing all that special, so maybe if we were seated by anyone else, we wouldn't have enjoyed Hard Rock as much... But Francis was legit.",

    "text": "To be fair, I don't eat at chain restaurants because I know they suck.  But we were in Las Vegas and we figured if there is any place to do some typical tourist crap, Las Vegas would be the place to do it.  My boyfriend had never been to a Hard Rock Cafe and so we decided that compared to the other places on the strip this would be somewhat in our price range and we wouldn't get hassled since we look like weirdos.  The place is neat, the weird cyber interactive stuff is cool maybe all Hard Rocks have those now, I don't know but it was fun looking at the kind of memorobelia that appealed to us at our table.  It was also fun voting for the music that would be played next, but we kept getting beaten out.  The service was meh.  Stupid jokes from the waitress asking us what band we were in.  Yes, because obviously if we were in a band and playing in Las Vegas we'd totally be eating at the Hard Rock Cafe on the Strip... ugh.  Also, this was kind of annoying - my boyfriend's ID picture is really old when he was younger, chubbier, and just had his wisdom teeth out, so in a word he looks kinda bad.  He's aware of that.  The waitress I guess in an attempt to... I don't know make him feel better?  Went on and on and on about how she shouldn't even accept the ID because it looks nothing like him now and how's he's gotten way more attractive... wtf?  The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.  My food was one degree above cold and my boyfriends food ended up making him sick.  The waitress never came back with condiments we asked for and we considered doing a runner because it was taking so long to get the check... and we were one of six occupied tables....  So all and all avoid this place if you can.  I've been to many a Hard Rock in my life, but this was the worst as far as food and service go.  One of the best as far as decor go.  Take it for what you will.",

I ordered the raspberry mint lemonade and it was very good, super refreshing. My husband and I split the chicken ceasar salad and the nachos. The salad was good, I would have liked more dressing but it was still tasty. The nachos are HUGE. Definitely something you could split among 3 or 4 people. They come with cheese, queso sauce, beans, tomatoes, onions, jalepenos and sour cream. We also had a side order of guacamole added to them. They are really good. Down side is that the cheese hardens after the first few minutes and it seems to get cold very fast so eat quickly! Overall it was a good meal.  When we go back to Vegas we won't eat here again, it was good, just nothing that makes me want to ensure a stop there upon our next visit.",

My salmon was tasty but it was not very eye appealing on a blackened piece of what I think was bamboo?  Server brought our drinks without a tray basically hugging the glasses to his chest.  Wine glass very streaked looking probably just water smears.  Will think twice before revisiting.",

    "text": "I attended a hosted Las Vegas Meetings and Events Winter party here on the third level here last night.   I was very impressed from the moment I walked in with how friendly the greeters/hostesses were to the servers and bartenders. On the strip sometimes it's hit or miss with encountering service people who actually act like they love their job.   If you had the privilege of seeing the previous Hard Rock Cafe this one just blows the old one out of the water! Very spacious and spread out, on the third level which is where I spent my evening is a nice sized stage and dancing area, with tables around the outside rim if you wanted to sit and listen to the music. Upstairs (and on the 2nd level) they also have an outside patio overlooking the strip. Inside is typical bar and dinner seating, as well as a section of secluded lounge chairs. (They have these little loungey areas on the second level too.) The tables around the couches act as a touch computer screen where you can play videos and flip through photos all with the touch of your finger!  Since the event was hosted, I can't comment on cost or really the food, as they just had passed h'ordeuvres. Everything was fried, which is OK, but I know they were trying to feed the masses and those items were probably the cheapest.   I tried the coconut shrimp, pot stickers and egg rolls, not much to say, they didn't have any flare or kick to them that would make them stand out from any other bar, but having eaten at Hard Rock's across the country I know they always do a solid American Cuisine- Love the there veggie burger!   This would be a fun place to get a group together for a dinner party or birthday. Would definitely go back.",

It was just way too loud to hear anything.  After 30 minutes in the place, I felt like my head was ringing.  It is kind of hard to enjoy the food when you have a speaker over your head on full volume.  For the love of god, someone lower down the volume!!!",

We were seated right away and our server was funny and helpful.  He kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed and two different managers came by to see that we were satisfied.  The food was delicious.  I was a little upset because I substituted a side for the twisted mac and cheese and was not informed that it was a $5 upcharge.  However, I made a small comment about this and it was immediately resolved with an apology and a comp, no questions asked.  Overall, I would definitely return here if I am looking for a nice night out!",

    "text": "I've never been a huge fan of Hard Rock Cafes, and kind of despise the idea of going from Cafe to Cafe to collect T-shirts that advertise for their business, but this place literally rocks!  First, upon stepping inside, there are about six screens which show Hard Rock Cafes in different cities of the world, live, allowing us to really watch what is happening in each of these venues, thousands of miles away.  I spent a few moments to watch diners in Beijing!  We went for drinks and for lunch, and while we were making our way to the bar/restaurant on the second floor, we spent time admiring outfitsworn by different pop icons which were diplayed in glass cases throughout. We also amused ourselves with the various interactive screens with music videos and interviews.  Once we sat down, we ordered tequila shots and some drinks.  They had the tequila we wanted and I had a really great mojito.  The food is the typical fare of Hard Rock Cafe...bar food, and some salads....I did, however, really enjoy my chicken salad.  Our server was super friendly and told us that they have live music on the third level every night and a DJ one night.  He then brought passes to get in without paying cover.  After that, we scored some rodeo gear from the Coors Girls, as the rodeo was passing though town and a cowboy was signing autographs. After lunch, we went to the balcony to check out the view, which overlooks the strip, across from the Monte Carlo.  Then, we went upstairs to check out the music club, though it was not open yet, as it was lunchtime.  The third level has an impressive circular bar and a full stage that reminds me of the House of Blues.  I cannot wait to go back and check out a show one night.",

We went to the one that wasn't on the strip, which was good because there was plenty of parking and not crowded at all. We ordered mixed drinks, which were fine besides the price. Then we ordered burgers- you know, typical cheeseburgers with bacon. I don't really know what happened. They were dry and didn't have great flavor. I didn't think you could mess up a burger, but just wasn't great. Service was fine, drinks were tasty and the ambiance is fun. But Vegas has WAY better food elsewhere for better prices.",

Just awful. We were seated in the middle of the room and while it was somewhat busy, we seemed to be sitting at the Invisible Table. It took forever to get menus or water. We sat and watched as all the other tables that were seated after us got service. Annoying. But we weren't angry yet.  A waitress from another table came by and asked if our waitress had helped us yet. We said no and she was nice enough to get things started (menus, water). Again it took forever to put our order in. They screwed it up--we asked for mayo and they never brought it. After waiting, I flagged down a bus boy and asked him.  The entire process took over an hour and a half. I finally flagged some random waiter down and asked for our bill.   While the food was pretty good, the service was so atrocious, I'd never return. It was a bad experience for my first time at a Hard Rock Cafe. LAME!",

The third floor venue is a bit of a hike for a lazy bum like me.  I took the stairs though there is an optional elevator.  I was concered how the concert was going to be pulled off given the nature of the act.  I saw GWAR, a group known for eleborate stage shows that saturate the audience, floor and surrounding areas with a red simulated blood and green slime.  I noticed when I walked in the memorabilia walls and support columns were wrapped in plastic sheets.  Smart move.  Security was tight upon entering.  Everybody had to take everything out of their pockets and get patted down and wanded.  It took a while (think busy airport) but I felt safe.  During the show security guards were taking down crowd surfing drunks.  It was entertaining.  Over all, the concert venue at the Hard Rock is like a bigger, cleaner and more modern looking version of the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  They have very similar set ups.  Down side of the eveing, the cheapest beer was PBR for $5.  That is a lot to pay for a pint of PBR.  That complaint aside, I had a great time for a great price (ticket cost).  I plan to go back if they continue to bring in the good acts.",

    "text": "Our hotel had a little guide to Vegas on the nightstand and as I scoured it for free and/or interesting things to do, the Interactive Rock Wall caught my eye as something my musician husband would enjoy. While it's impressive in theory, the more interesting and fun techie toy we found was just in the waiting area. It was a table top touch screen, reminiscent of the old pac-man tables often found in restaurants during the 80s/90s, but WAY MORE AWESOME... er, well, those were pretty sweet too.   I'm drifting...  So the interactive rock wall has random images of memorabilia floating around which you can drag and touch click and enlarge... and is quite large, with basically 6 docking stations for 6 users to peruse the floating options. However, the table top touch screens had a search feature so you could choose whose junk you got to look at. We immediately searched for the Boss's items in the collection, enjoying the i-whatever type technology that allowed us to pinch and spread our fingers on the screen to zoom in and out and read old setlists and the like.   Fun times for music geeks.  I believe these are the same kinds of screens we saw in the booths, but our table didn't have one to play with... so if you want to enjoy that part of the place, ask specifically to sit near one!   Oh yeah and as far as the food went, it was fine, just as at all Hard Rocks, although I give extra props to the waitress who noticed me order my veggie burger without cheese and asked if I was vegan.  **Side note, vegans, don't plan to eat here. There's really nothing for you. That veggie burger had cheese in it, and I was so grateful that she let me know!!! The option for a side salad is there, but it won't really fill you... with food or nutrients since it was all iceberg or other light-colored lettuces with practically no vitamins.",

I had to waive one down and he gave me my change and says have a great day and ran off, you would think he was off but nope he ignored me completely.

I had to ask.again  can I open a tab and they finally did , the bartender that came in took care of my friend and I.  However I can't believe with so many bartenders you are ignored like you can't afford to be there so let me get others who look like they can .  I don't think I will be coming back here plenty of bars  in the strip. I will be taking my business somewhere else. I do not need special treatment I just wanted a drink and to be acknowledged.",

    "text": "I came to this place the week of August 6th. Once I arrived to the front (host), the lady at the computer was on the phone and didn't even greet with a polite gesture of \"I'll be right with you\" or anything of the sort. Once she was off the phone, she continued to work on the computer. My two children and myself stood there waiting for her approach. After a few minutes I asked \"is this where we wait for tables?\" She smirked at me and said \"ah yes.\" My son said \"let's leave mom she is rude.\" I didn't leave. Even after my initial approach she didn't initiate by letting us to our table. So I asked \"Table for 3 please.\" Without saying anything, she led me to another lady and told her to seat us. Once we got to our table, our waiter who was also rude asked \"okay what do you guys want?\" I assumed he asked us to order our drinks and we did. He came around again after viewing our menus and we ordered accordingly. After completing our meals, we ordered our deserts and upon the arrival of our desserts he laid it on our table and said \"here it is\" appearing irritated. Just about the service at this place seemed very rude and unfriendly. I will NOT be going back to this place and I will be contacting the corporate about the lady at the front (the host) for her demeanor.",

I ordered a chicken cobb salad and my husband got  pizza(flatbread) and macaronni as a side as the waitress explained the pizza is small and she was right!Sadly the macaronni was a loss for him.  I will say I ordered the bahama mama and regret not getting the souvenir size which wouldve been a cheaper option.Oh well,all in all love the vibe.Next time we will sit in the patio area.",

There were 5 or 6 different bartenders on. With how slow it was there was no reason for us to be neglected for something as basic as offering a food menu.

She brought me an entirely different drink.  That's gutsy.  But she made a good assessment of the drink I ordered and made a decision about what I might like.  Good choice, and great observation.    The manager came by to check on us.  On his second check, a person at our table realized he didn't like his meal to no fault of the cafe, he just didn't like it.  His meal was promptly replaced, and offered a free shot.  Also, our sever handled our moderately sized party with grace and speed.  Kudos!",

I find it funny that this place is advertised on yelp under \"Canadian\" I am Canadian and the food is more American than it is Canadian, especially in portions, menu items and preparation. The food is so so, however, I'm in it for the museum aspect of it and the cool rock star casino chips that you can buy at the cash out booth. I like looking at rock memorabilia. I am a bit of a music junkie to be honest, therefore, seeing cool guitars, costumes etc is a cheap free entertainment aspect on the strip. It's not actually on the Strip but slightly on the outskirts, almost a 20 minute walk. Our waitress was friendly and the prices were decent for what it was.",

The parking situation sounded tricky - and it was. The fact that the directions provided were incorrect didn't help. Parking for the venue is in the parking garage for the Showcase Mall - and costs 3.00 (cash only) to boot. Paying for parking is unheard of on The Strip!   OK - so once we find the parking lot, pay and park - the elevator dumps you out on a side street. About a block away from the entrance. We started walking toward Las Vegas Blvd. and slowly realized that all these people waiting in line were waiting to get into the venue. This is where it gets silly.   In order to get into the concert venue one needs to: 1. Wait outside in line in the desert heat. 2. Once you get past the first staggered security point - you're released by the security guard to walk down the public sidewalk (with everyone else that just happens to be strolling the strip unimpeded) to the entrance to the Hard Rock Store. You walk through the store - right through all the shoppers to three flights of steep stairs. All the while, there is nothing to keep random people that haven't waited in line from joining your group on the way (as one girl did - slipping into our group right behind us). So, lesson number one - only suckers wait in line... 3. It took about 45 minutes total to get into the venue - and we arrived at posted start time. Luckily, the show started late so we didn't miss any of the show.  Once we got inside, the venue actually wasn't bad. The sound was decent and although the place holds 1100 people - it still manages to feel intimate. In keeping with Hard Rock tradition - the artifacts and historical exhibits were well done and cool. Drinks are at Strip club price - $16.00 a round for a bourbon & coke and a Miller Light.  All I can say is, I've been a musician and an avid rock show attendee for three decades now - and I'm sorry - but it's obvious to me that they built the venue with no consideration as to how a large audience would actually access the performance space on the 3rd floor. This major planning fail kind of set the tone for the night unfortunately...  UPDATE: I received a few very nice messages from Hard Rock management - and they'll be working to address the entrance issues and are hoping to make this location into a premiere Las Vegas music venue.  I can't wait to see what they can work out.",

It was chill the crowd wasn't too crazy. The only complaint I have was the DJ wasn't that great. I've heard way better mixes than that. I feel that it only became tolerable music because of the free drinks and is just becoming more drunk. Overall it was a fun experience though.  We stayed there all night.",

I think he new that I was the bride to be because I was so nervous when I got there but he checked in numerous times throughout the dinner.  They gave us a two hour window and it was perfect.

I went back to the host stand said that we have been waiting for that table that they just gave to somebody else. The server that was standing at the host stand at that moment gave me dirty looks like I was a moron. The host went out there talk to the table for a few seconds and came back out to me and told me we don't have a table for you. I was asking for an exclamation of why they had no table for me the server got an extreme attitude and started to smart off so I asked him for the manager. The manager was no help I feel like he was just patronizing me \"oh my how does that happen\" what a complete joke and on top of all that I had to waste $10 for parking",

Virtually any conceivable trinket, souvenir, or swag emblazoned with the Hard Rock Cafe logo is down there somewhere.  Yelp's check-in & the \"cafe\" portion of Hard Rock Cafe were upstairs. With checking into YSB came voucher tickets for a free Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktail at the Hard Rock Cafe bar. Go to the bar for a free drink? Don't gotta ask me twice...  So, the girlfriend & I sidled up to the bar. Service was extremely friendly & we got our cocktails in a jiffy. While sipping our refreshingly free drinks, we noticed a small menu of items specifically for Yelp: Pork Belly Sliders, Braised Short Rib Tacos & Fried Stuffed Jalapenos.  I ordered all 3 to sample. Our food was taking a while, but our bartender went back to check it out & we had our order shortly after. The Tacos & the Jalapenos were excellent, flavorful, nicely spicy & were served with knockout delicious dipping sauces. Comparatively, the Pork Belly Sliders were a little bland.  All 3 dishes were tapa-sized, so there was room for dessert. We got the Caramel Xango. Oh. My. God! Now that alone was worth walking into the building for. Cheesecake wrapped in tortilla, deep-fried, & then served with whipped cream + caramel & strawberry sauces drizzled all over everything. Wow.  While chewing & sipping, we took in the Hard Rock ambiance. Lots of glass & steel with plenty music memorabilia throughout. It's pretty cool. For the most part the food was pretty good too & service was top notch. After squaring the tab, we exited the same way we came in, through the gift shop.",

    "text": "Where other Themed restaurants fail, The Hard Rock Cafe keeps doing it right. The food is great, the atmosphere is unique (its just like all the other HRCs) but his particular visit was more about the service than the food or atmosphere.   It has been awhile since I have eaten at a Hard Rock and I have never eaten at this one on the strip.   This particular visit was in June 2014.  The day was hot my friends...110+ but since I had just endured one of the coldest winters up in Canada (Temps of -50) I opted to sit on the patio...it was a good idea at first, but after about twenty minutes I was hurting and the water service was lacking.  That is the only reason for 3 stars, but it's Vegas for crying outloud and it should be just common sense to keep checking on the water even though I was drinking beers at the same time...I ended up only getting one water in all that time.   The waitress who took my order was great at taking the original orders, but the follow through was lack luster. She brought me the original beer and water that I asked for, but then I never saw her again...not even to receive the bill.   After waiting and waiting...(there were other patrons on the patio, but I seemed to be in the twilight zone) I had to go to the bathroom. So I went. When I came back, the big guy at the door was looking at me a little sternly and then the waitress came up to me...shes like, \"Oh there you are, we thought you took off\". I was like WTF, why would they say that...you don't come to the table to check on my food, refill my water or beer and then you act like I am a dasher!   Needless to say the tip was about as stellar as the service. When I left I gave the guy a return glare. I should have talked to the manager, but I was honestly too perturbed to deal with excuses.   TIP: If you want patrons to pay the bill, give them the bill, don't treat them like thieves when they go to the bathroom if you haven't given them a bill yet.   It's Vegas, and I like the food there, which was great (Burger) but there are a lot of other places to go where they may treat you a little better. Once I paid the waitress said, \"I didn't think you would just take off\" to which I wanted to reply \"I didn't think you would be such a shitty waitress\" but I didn't because...well, I didn't think of it at the time :)  Cheers",

What was a little disappointing was they didn't have the shot glass that we wanted. Strange.  Always thought the shot glasses and T-shirts were their best sellers? Maybe not.  I also stopped upstairs to the cafe at 11am to try and use my Yelp drink ticket.  Going upstairs, the hostesses did not greet and it took a bit of time to find a server but I ended up talking to the bartender who, after asking, told me the tickets were invalid on Sunday. I guess that was my bad.  I don't know if I just came too early on the lack of service but hopefully it will be better next time I'm in town.   Oh, and oddly enough, there's no \"LAS VEGAS\" on the guitar outside of Hard Rock. So when taking a picture, you still can't really tell what city you're in.",

There were People with Garbage Cans Cleaning Around without any Problem! Security Was Visible, and Aware of Potential Problems!  There is/are A lot of Seating All Around the Concert Room, You had Barstool type Seating, or you Could sit in 3 Different Areas where you could have a View of the Las Vegas Strip, sit in Comfortable Sofas, and Chill with your Drink & Dance in your Seat! lol  I Would Come back for A Concert here!!! Love the Environment...  =)",

My wife ordered a burger and fries and I ordered a side salad and chicken wings. Both meals were good, nothing to brag about but we had no complaints about the food. Once we order d our food we didn't see our waitress again for awhile. The server brought the food out to the table, put the meals on the wrong side of the table and walked away.  After taking a few bites of the food I realized I was out of water and so was my wife. Waitress never came around to check on how the food was or if we needed any drinks. AFTER we were both done with our drinks she finally came to the table and asked how the meal was and if we needed anything. I told her just the check. At this point it was a little late for anything. It took her another 5-10 mins to bring the check.   I give this review a 3 because the food was good.  Service would get 0 if possible. Hard Rock has some work to do on customer service.",

I go to every single Hard Rock Cafe in Hawaii, Waikiki, Maui, Honolulu, Palm Springs, Los Angeles, and this never happened.

He was attentive everyday he invited us to go upstairs to the hard rock live and actually turned on the stage lights so we could use it as a back drop for some wedding photos! When we returned the next day he had the live singer recognize our wedding and sing a song from our favorite band. This place made our wedding experience!

Both of which were awesome but the pancakes were especially yummy.  Nice freshly brewed iced tea and crispy bacon round up the mix.  They were having \"acoustic breakfast\" with a live musician which was cool.   This is a VERY large Hard Rock but it has a great selection of memorabilia and very efficient and friendly service.

We've been to a few, but yet, none have been able to stand up to those first original amazing nachos. So when we decided to drive up to Tahoe to go to the hard rock cafe there's only one thing on our minds, trying the nachos. When we got to the restaurant we checked out the menu and only found one, sadly, nacho option.  After discussing our dilemma with the waitress, she suggested that we add some shredded pork to our nacho order. We thought it over for about two seconds and decided that was a great idea. Our nachos came and they were great. Were they as great as though nachos we had in Las Vegas? No. But they were still really good and totally worth the drive.  you know, there is one sad aspect to this review, our waitress told us that in about six weeks the hard rock cafe found in Harrah's Lake Tahoe is going to be closing down. There are rumors that it's going to be moving over to the now Lake Tahoe hard rock hotel but even our waitress did not know if that was going to actually happen. So head up to the hard rock cafe while you still can. It has some pretty darn good nachos.",

Our server, Tommy was a friendly, worldly guy and we had some good conversations about sports.  Unfortunately, our order must have gotten lost in the shuffle somewhere but the Asst General Mgr, Kim came to our booth and apologized for the inconvenience.  We were hungry but not in a big hurry in Vegas.  She offered to comp our meal which was very kind of her.  She seems like a wonderful woman to work with and Tommy quite personable with the customers.  I'd highly recommend this cafe for the wide variety of food on the menu but don't leave without taking in all of the memorabilia on all the walls and up on the third floor as well.",

I really can't complain.   I only fly direct from NY to Vegas. When I land I like my first dinner to be all ready and set up. I stay at the cosmopolitan every time. But I love a good burger. In Vegas why not spoil your self to a burger?!  The night of when I land. My promoter told me about this hardtack deal.  I get the $25 per person deal at the hard rock. This includes.  VIP seating (no lines, priority seating) VIP special menu Beer is included  Desert of my choice   The best part is it's pre paid. there is indoor and outdoor seating so you can sit inside or outside. If you choose outside there is a great view of the strip.  I recommend sitting outside.   I enjoy knowing my food and my guests meal is already paid for the first night in Vegas. From the cosmo I take a car to the hard rock. It's a bit of a walk. The staff is always top notch. I have never had bad service here. Last year I even used my $25 deal at the bar.  I still had great service.   Overall I recommend this Hard Rock Cafe to anyone. The food is always consistent for a chain. The VIP is a nice additive. I have been very impressed with the service so far. I will continue to come for this deal when I land in Vegas!!",

The bar I sat at and receive blah services was HARD ROCK CAFE BAR.  The bartender didn't know how to make a lemon drop martini, or any martini.  She only knew how to make what was in the happy hour menu.  Well I'm wanting at martini and will pay for it, was informed she's in training and have to ask one of the other bartenders to make it.  Ok fine. Other bartender comes over ,doesn't introduced himself or anything, abruptly takes out a book and look up how to make a martini. Are you seriously looking up a martini? I'm the only person EVER in the history of the Vegas strip to ask for a martini? My cousin finished her drink. I told them nevermind since I had yet to receive mines.  I'm giving them 3 stars because the young lad that gave my cousin her complementary hard rock cup wa extremely nice and apologizes for the rudeness.  Hope yelp realize I'm talking about the correct bar.",

While I suggested we eat before the show, he wanted to come here in the wee hours for the evening energy!  This time, we returned with 2 friends!  I was excited to find that for a limited time they offered menu items from tons of other HRC so I tried the burger that came with pineapple and spam.  It was SO delicious and juicy and the spam was a perfect accent, not overpowering!  My son got his usual pulled pork sandwich, and my daughter her usual child's chicken strips (in the electric guitar plate).  Our friends got a few appetizers and a salad.  While I didn't taste theirs, they looked and smelled amazing!  Our  Three Thumb Review is two and a half thumbs up!  I loved the opportunity to share the evening with friends in a big comfy booth (But I gave it 1/2 a thumb less because our water disappeared after our order was taken.  It was kinda busy that night, but still...). My teen son loved the consistently delicious food and rockin' atmosphere. My tween daughter still thinks that HRC has the best kids menu for eating and for playing with!  We're planning a return trip with even more friends by the end of the year. I'm sure this will be on the itinerary!  #ThreeThumbReviews #MakesMeWander #Vegas #RoadTrip #FamilyFun #Nightlife #RepeatVisit",

I've been here on two occasions - once for the grand opening and again last weekend for the Motley Brews craft beer festival. I haven't had a chance to actually eat in the cafe yet, so this review is purely for the building as a venue.  It's actually a pretty impressive spot. The bottom floor is the gift shop. If you're a Hard Rock junkie, I'm sure you'll find something to take home with you. The second floor is where the actual cafe resides.  It has a nice size with a balcony that overlooks the strip. In the waiting area are Microsoft Surface tables where you can play around with music-related trivia and activities.  The third floor houses a small museum, a bar, and a stage area for small concerts. During the grand opening, I got to see Chris Cornell perform. This is also where the Motley Brews event occurred. It's a nice open space for these types of events. It also has a balcony overlooking the strip.  I think it's a little strange that we now have two Hard Rock Cafes and one Hotel in Vegas. I haven't been to the other cafe in about 17 years, but I can only imagine that this new one blows that one away. Then again, if you're a Hard Rock junkie (like a few people we met at the grand opening), you'll visit and appreciate both places.  Overall, this is a good addition to the strip.",

I loved not having to track her down and ask for more.  A huge plus was the LIVE entertainment vocalist who was killing it on his covers.The bill would've only came out to $70 which was so worth it for the quality of service and atmosphere that was there.

He never did get us silverware, and passed us off to another server with the excuse he was \"going home\"- even though we paid out and left whie he was still helping other tables. The service left something to be desired, but the food was good.  The main reason this gets 4 stars and not three was the friendly music manager (I want to say his name was Mike but it could have been Jason) that stopped to talk to us and gave us some great tips about heading down to check out Freemont street when we asked about what else to do in Vegas besides the strip and casinos.",

They have good security, breaking up fights tight when it started. Employees are friendly and helpful, and bathrooms are clean and tidy. Overall, I had a great experience. Only reason why I gave it only 4 stars was because there are a lot of barriers when you wanna get around the club, and also for it being on the 3rd floor.",

When we walked in we were greeted and offered to have our picture taken with the Hard Rock backdrop, which we did. Seated immediately, and our waitress was there quickly to get our drink order and came back with them to take our order.  Everyone's food and drinks were fabulous. We had a very nice lunch and the price was well worth the food and excellent service!   I had the Avocado Salad, my niece has an avocado sandwich, my daughter and her boyfriend both had burgers. Again, all the food was delicious!  I recommend everyone put this place on your to do list the next time you go to Vegas. Enjoy all the memorabilia they have all over the walls, the music and videos they play that brings back memories and be sure to stop in their gift shop before you leave!",

Then we went into the gift shop I was going to buy an item they didn't have our size so they called the other store not have the size we wanted and had them hold it for us.

I was surprised for such a clean store to have a smelly bathroom",

Honestly, I normally wouldn't come to a chain in Vegas.... but this was the Yelp Spring Break headquarters and we were enticed by the $10 lunch menu for us. Since we were checking in here anyway, we decided to check it out.   - Hickory Smoked Pork Belly Sliders - They were decent, but the bread/filling ratio was off and I thought the pork was much much too sweet. Still tasty though.  - Braised Short Rib Tacos - My favorite! Great combination of flavors, perfect short ribs, and the dipping sauces were a great match.  - Nacho Mama Fried Jalapenos - We were warned they would be spicy, but they were overwhelmingly so! I loved the crispiness and the way they were loaded with cream cheese, but I can usually handle spicy and couldn't handle much more than a few bites of these.  - Twisted Mac and Cheese - This wasn't on the Yelp menu, but who can resist mac and cheese? This one was a little different, with buffalo sauce added (which I wouldn't have been able to tell, had we not been told). It gave it an extra interesting little kick, and the dish was creamy, cheesy, and gooey, they way it should be.   The dishes were more tapas style/samplers than the lunch specials advertised, but it was still cool to check out a place that none of us had been to. The free drink tickets from Yelp made it more than worthwhile too.... our Bacardi Torched Cherry cocktails were refreshing and strong.   Michael was personable, hilarious, and enthusiastic. He really wanted us to enjoy our whole experience there, and he was beyond great. He gave some great drink recommendations to my drinking-partner-and-crime and I: their version of a Long Island and another SoCo-based sweet drink. Both highly recommended.   Would I come back? Hard Rock was an excellent sponsor and host for our event, and a great atmosphere to get the party started. The fantastic service would bring me back, and also my discovery of the patio...... the front of the dining area is a huge, shaded patio with a view of the whole Strip and Bellagio fountains. Great place to grab some drinks and get into the Vegas spirit.",

Maybe my expectations were set to high but it was kind of a letdown. It was pretty cool to see the memorabilia and some of the crazy outfits celebrities have worn over the years, but I wasn't as blown away as I had expected.   The food was pretty good but the service was.. How do I put it... Weird? We were greeted by a younger waiter who we could tell was a little bit nervous. I guess he was in training and the lady training him was standing directly behind him. He was trying so hard but every so often she would correct him on the spot or offer us something he hadn't mentioned. We felt so bad for him because you could tell how hard he was trying and she made him look like he kept messing up. I felt so bad for the guy, that's not a good way to train employees in my opinion. After they leave the table she could have offered suggestions for improvement not correct him on the spot, that doesn't promote confidence. Before we were done eating the guy stopped by our table to say goodbye and that they were sending him home. The lady that was training him came over shortly afterward to say that he had to go home and it wasn't because of anything he did wrong. HOW AWKWARD!   Aside from that I ordered a huge burger and yes I ate the entire thing, it was yummy :). I ordered a Bloody Mary and it wasn't the best, nor were the onion rings that accompanied my burger. My friend said her Mac and cheese was good but not the best. The meal ended up being pretty pricey but I would prob go back, especially if it was during happy hour or something :).",

He was patronizing and it was hard to get his attention.  One of my other friends ordered a mojito and decided it wasn't quite what she wanted. She asked the same waiter if it was possible to switch the drink and he replied 'It's alcohol. Just drink it.\" When she tried to explain that she didn't want to spend her money on something that didn't taste good and wanted to try something else, he then replied \"Why? So you can just tell me that the new drink isn't what you wanted either?\" She then told him never mind and he left without another word.

He was busy flirting with another table that had single ladies and bearing everything. We were more conservator because we were couple up and not bearing nothing. I order the pulled pork sandwich and they brought me the Texas sandwich. I ask twice and both waiters reassure me it was the right one and then I was notified it wasn't normally any other place will come the food because it was their mistake they just shrug it off and made my experience not satisfying and regret  being there.",

We ordered two of the jumbo combo's to start, then I and a few others on the table had the New York Strip Steak, both were a good size.  I have had much better steaks for less though, so I will mark it down slightly.  The service was very attentive and friendly, I hope they are like that no matter the group size.  The atmosphere was lively (which was a good point) due to the number of people in, and music videos playing.",

    "text": "I don't mind playing the role of tourist every once in a while and heading down to the strip. After visiting M&M World and the World of Coca-cola, my wife, kid, and I stopped by the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch. It's an impressive looking place. Three stories. The first is the store, second is the restaurant, and third is the concert area.  The last time I ate at a Hard Rock Cafe was probably the late '90s (in Cancun). I wasn't impressed back then with the food and I wasn't expecting much this time around either. But, it was actually better than I had hoped.  The wife got a burger that wasn't on the menu. A beef patty topped with a portobello mushroom and haystack onions, along with some other stuff. Also came with a side salad. She liked it and it was enough food for two people.   I got the BBQ bacon cheeseburger (topped with caramelized onions, crispy bacon, and cheddar cheese). It was juicy and tasty and the BBQ sauce had a sweet, smokey flavor to it. Not bad at all. I also had a margarita with pomegranate and some other fruity flavors (don't judge me... sure I occasionally drink fruity cocktails. I don't care what others think.) that was pretty good.  Our son got the chicken tenders. Three to an order with a large heap of fries.   Our server was friendly and stopped by often to check on us. But wasn't overly intrusive. He even brought out a complimentary sundae for our kid after he found out it was his birthday.  There's a huge interactive wall just past the hostess stand and there's also a touchscreen at each booth with info about memorabilia, merchandise in their store, and a voting system for the next song that's played in the restaurant. It's a great idea, but the interface is clunky. Anyone who's ever used an iphone or android will probably find it to be a little primitive. Also, there was a huge disconnect between the song that the screen indicated was playing and the music that was piped through the sound system. I don't think it listed the correct song the whole time we were there.  Overall, this is a place that will attract only tourists looking for a relatively cheap, predictable meal (at least for the second floor dining area). The food was 3-star worthy, but I'm tossing in an extra star because of the good service.",

I ordered the nachos however, and those were very bad. I added chicken to the order but I think that made it even worse. There was a funky taste that wasn't so pleasant. And they add some weird green sauce on top (I don't think it was guacamole though). I definitely wouldn't order them again. I've had my fair share of nachos; these were the worst.   Service was good though. Very friendly waitress (crystal). I would probably go back but I would definitely stick to something else on the menu.",

First they herd you over for a washed out picture, which they try to sell you for $20.00 later, then if your lucky they sit you down. New waiter in training was awesome, the establishment let not only me down but his hard service. 1. My fork had food remaining on it from previous patron. 2. FF right out of the refrigerator ???????????? 3. Head manager who is in his own world, then after I brought it to the immediate managers attention, I was offered free desert; \"are you serious?\"  Lastly we were looking for a good lace to grab a late night snack the previous evening, they closed early for lack of Patrons? what does that tell you about this place? Totally disappointed",

This HRC is one level retail, second a restaurant and the third floor is a music venue. I  like that it's a decent sized but still intimate. There's a large patio if you want some air as well which has a nice view of the whole strip. I am a old crab and in the back by the bar is a raised area with seating. I can't do this whole standing and squashed onto people type business anymore so when there is seating, I am way more happy. Sound is pretty good in here but depends on the setup can get loud in a small space.   It was a fairly decent place for a beer fest, given that it wasn't too busy but this can be a clusterfuck if it was double the amount of people.   Overall, good non club venue for music.   (Yelp 100 Challenge 4/100)",
