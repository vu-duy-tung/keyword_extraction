After waiting 45 minutes for my food (15 minutes past estimated time) I got almost all the way home before noticing they gave me the wrong pizza. I turned around and was treated like it was not a big deal that they made me wait and that they were going to make me late for work. Not an acceptable way to treat your customers!",

I have had bacon on a pizza before but not like this and homemade sausage. If your in Vegas and would like to get away from the hectic strip area take the drive. Very small dine in area but if its a nice day down at the end of the strip mall there are tables and chairs with a lake view",

The first time they delivered there was no pepperoni on the pizza only green peppers on one half and olives on the other half. I called and let them know and the guy on the phone repeated my order perfectly and said he would have another pizza out right away. When I got the pizza there was pepperoni on the whole pizza and on one half the bell peppers and the other half olives. My daughter doesn't like anything but pepperoni that's why I specifically said only on one half I wanted the extras. Anyways just a little disappointed",

We ordered a veggie pizza with pepperoni (don't judge) and The Works cheesesteak. They were out of provolone - let me repeat that. Out of provolone. We came back in the 25 min. they told us and not only was it ready but the one table was empty so we sat down to enjoy the food fresh. I opened the pizza box and there was no pepperoni. Ok, mistakes happen. They offered to make us a new pie which we declined. Hey, it was a mistake. We did take them up on free bottle of water and a refund on the cost of the add-on.   The food was DELICIOUS!  Really good. I hope they get over their growing pains soon so people can have a good experience. It was the worth the couple of minor mishaps.",

No bags to put the wings in & sauce them - no center piece on pizza preventing the lid & cheese touching  The fries sucked for the same reason as the rest of the food - no ventilation & so now after spending $55 on food I'm standing at my oven cooking trying to revive the food I paid for.  Also check out the pic of the wings & notice the sauce on the right - ventilation again would've prevented this tragic mistake .. Friggin disgusting - NVR AGAIN!",

We ordered two 14\" pizzas, one was The Greek, the other was The Italian White Pie. We also ordered The Works Cheese Steak, that we had cut into fours, and Fried Mushrooms. The Greek was the best out of the two pies we ordered, because the sauce and toppings all worked well together. However the Italian White pie was just not to our taste. The garlic & sauteed onion was just too strong tasting for us. The Works Cheese Steak was very tasty. The ribeye was of good quality, but it could use a little more cheese on top. That said, it's still the best I've ever eaten. The fried mushrooms were cooked just right and piping hot, with a sauce called TGP which was nice and slightly spicy. We've all agreed to come back here and try the BBQ Maui Wowie pie.",

If your website is crap maybe fix it. He even called one of the people back to continue argue how he is right and she is wrong. Try to learn customer service. This is not how business is done.

The meat pie was delicious because honestly how could you go wrong with extra meat. I probably wouldn't get the Italian white again; I would go with something else next time, it was a little bland.   This place is a little hidden inside the Lakes community. If we go back I'll order a small pizza next time  so that there aren't  leftovers. I for one like next day pizza but  but not from this place. The pies weren't great but they were not bad either.",

To start  no air conditioning in the establishment hello your in las Vegas it's August you need that fixed. Second we ordered the bbq Maui wowie pizza (seen on ddd) and an order of chicken fingers. the pizza was very bland, sauce had no flavor the best tasting thing was the pineapple. The cheese looked hardly present and what was present looked old. Not to mention the slice I had  had a plastic string in it which looked like fishing line. The best thing I ate was the chicken fingers even tho they gave me the wrong sauces. So disappointed not sure if I'll ever make the drive from Aliante to this place again. Boo",

    "text": "The first time we had pizza from Those Guys we thought it was amazing. We picked up our order of pizza and cinnamon poppers and we all really enjoyed it and complimented the sauce, crust and overall freshness. The last two times we ordered, the quality has steadily declined. Last time the crust wasn't quite the same and it was greasy. We figured we would give it another shot tonight and ordered same toppings we did the first time we ordered. It was worse, sadly. The crust was dense and hard to chew, the cheese had congealed and sauce had soaked through and appeared to us maybe it had been sitting a while?  We figured this would be the pizza place we order from when our little ones want pizza night, but after tonight and finishing only a few pieces from a regular size pie, we will be branching out and ordering elsewhere from here on out. It's always sad hen a place goes downhill after just a couple visits.   Maybe it was the fact that we did delivery and not takeout? Who know. Either way, we won't be doing Those Guys next time we order unfortunately. I'm giving 3 stars because initially I would have given a 5 star review, but after the last two visits and them being more like 1-2 star reviews, I just took a couple stars off. Any advice I would give would be, don't so delivery. Maybe that'll help? I do want to add that my husband said they when he picked the pizza up the first time we ordered he said the owner was cranking out the pizzas and really seemed passionate about what he was doing. Tonight we both thought maybe the owner didn't do the last two pizzas because they were so different.",

Needless to say, I won't be back.",

The proportions of cheese, meats, sauce, to dough ratio was perfect in every bite. We also ordered the philly cheese steak fries and that was very good as well. I feel like this pizza joint is one of the best in vegas and will strongly recommend it to anyone who is craving pizza!",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review and I am glad to give it to Those Guys Pies.  I was looking to try something new than your standard pizza chains, so I searched Yelp.  The first place that appeared was Those Guys Pies.  So I read some reviews, looked at the menu, and decided to try them.  I was not let down!  I ordered the \"Big Pie\" Meat Pie, which was excellent!  The meatballs are sliced in a way that makes the meatball slices bigger than most places Pepperoni.  Not only that, but they taste great as well.  The bacon was tasty and not \"fatty\" like regular bacon can be.  And for the size of the pizza, it was worth the price!  I also ordered a \"Regular Pie\" custom because they have a pizza sauce that I had to try: Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce.  First off, the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce is awesome!  It gives a nice burn without overpowering the pizza taste.  I added meatballs, pepperoni, and broccoli rabe to this pizza, to go with the sauce.  Everything went well with the ingredients.  If I have one issue with this pizza, is that it could have used a bit more sauce (only because I loved the sauce).  Their cheesesteak (which I ordered with ribeye, onions and white american cheese) is one of the better cheesesteaks I have had.  Very tasty with the right amount of cheese and meat.  The bread was soft in the middle and has a nice crust, without the hardness that is found on the ends of a lot of french bread.  I also tried the 3 cheese fries, which was interesting because of the cheeses used.  I'm not sure which cheeses were on it, but I'm guessing it was whiz, mozzarella, and cheddar?  Even still, the fries were tasty and filling...a meal unto itself!  The price is a bit higher than standard pizza chains, but for the quality of the pizza, the cheesesteaks and the ingredients, it is well worth the money.  Plus, the one dollar delivery fee was a plus!   I can definitely recommend Those Guys Pies, and will order again soon!  Oh, and to Those Guys Pies...do NOT get rid of the Ghost Pepper Pizza Sauce!  That stuff is so delicious!!",

Finally I asked about the order, please note only one other family was sitting there so it was clear to see I was waiting forever! I finally asked about the food and they realized it was mixed with other items. They gave us the order and we left only to get home and it have onions. Seriously sucks a place with such great food is understaffed and they can't pump out orders properly. The amount of tickets they had there should have been at least 1 or 2 more people working.

I love the meatballs and the bacon, just ridiculously good brown sugary bacon.  All of the ingredients are super fresh. My favorite pies are the shroom white, with goat cheese and seasonal mushrooms, and the meat pie. I usually split the pie down the middle for some variety, you can get any two gourmet pies in one here.  There's virtually no place to sit here, so grab it to go or make an order for delivery.  If you prefer pizza hut or domino's then kill yo self. Eat those guys pies and slap yourself a few times for me.",

We picked our order up and were completely intoxicated by the smell the entire 10 minute ride home.  The pizza crust was perfect...crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside...perfect.  The red sauce had excellent flavor and delicious.  The home-made sausage and sweet onions on top were to die for.  The cheesesteak was also amazing...excellent quality steak and full of flavor.  I agree with other reviews...the best in town!  We hope they are able to expand and offer seating on location one day soon so we can eat it as soon as it comes out of the oven.

As someone from the city that made cheesesteaks famous - I've had my fair share of good steaks and bad both in Philadelphia and outside of Philadelphia.  While I don't think these were the best steaks that I've ever had - they are definitely one of the better cheesesteaks in Vegas AND they come TRUE to form ... (American, Provolone, or Whiz) and with or without fried onions ... NO GREEN PEPPERS in the equation.    There is adequate high quality meat, chopped correctly, cheese incorporated correctly and great bread (even though it's not Amoroso's) ... but anyone from Philly knows that a good cheesesteak does not have to have an Amoroso roll.  We ordered cheese fries with whiz as well and although I loved the fact that I was able to get fries - I didn't like that they were seasoned fries.  I'd much prefer a standard plain fry that is a little thicker with cheese on top.  We'll be back for sure.",

So I ordered a cheesesteak no onions no peppers extra cheese and what I got was a cheesesteak with mushrooms ... huh. I called and spoke to Jeff the mgr and he was very argumentative telling me that since I ordered with no onion or peppers they automatically assume that the customer wants mushrooms what??? So after arguing with him I hung up and looked at their menu and guess what?? No mention of mushrooms at all. Told him I've ordered from them for years the same way with no problem. Called him back and he was a tad more understanding and I said you looked up my history of how much I order from u and his dimenor changed and offered to make me a new sandwich, I accepted, problem was it was so salty I couldn't eat it. Was this intentional? Not sure but it was inedible! Very poor experience. I will give them another chance maybe!!!left s pretty bad taste in my mouth for 50 bucks plus tip$!!!!  Oh he did give me s pumpkin cheesecake  UPDATE!! I'm so impressed! The owner called me and apologized! Wow! He really cares!! I should not have done this review bc of ONE bad experience after many perfect experiences.",

I had this pizza for the first time about three years ago and I remembered it just enough to try it again when we were deciding on where to order delivery from. It was a little soggy by the time it was delivered to us, and I'm slightly disappointed that the basil came in the form of tiny stringy paper looking slices. When paying $1.50 per topping, you expect whole basil leaves, even if they are wilted from the cooking process.   I can see this being a really good experience if you're eating it there fresh, but maybe next time  I'll try picking it up myself to see how it holds up.",

I lived a large chunk of my childhood in Brooklyn, NY and North Jersey, having traveled to Philadelphia often; pizza and cheesesteaks are serious business for me. I wasn't expecting a traditional crispy New York slice, but anyway what I got was the soggiest and doughiest pie I've ever seen. A pizza should give you great contrast of textures, between the fluffiness of the ricotta, to the fatty chewiness of the pepperoni and sausage, to the crunch of the crust - the supreme and the Italian white fail to do accomplish this. The toppings really are very high quality, but that is irrelevant if the pizza itself is bad - getting good ingredients requires no skill just the willingness to charge 25 dollars for a pie. The cheesesteak was totally flavorless, no salt, no pepper, no marinade for the steak - it only had the requisite greasiness (of which I'm a fan). Again good quality steak, well cooked onions, but the bread was soggy. For a relatively solid cheesesteak city, this was really subpar. The only saving grace of my order were the wings, which are baked very well, but still don't rank anywhere near the best wings in the city. This is the second time I've taken a suggestion from D3 and the second time in which such suggestion failed me! I give 3.5 stars, because, after all, even disappointing pizza is still pizza and the delivery was quick.",

    "text": "It's funny how things change as the years of our lives pass by.   I can remember, with vivid clarity, how obsessed I was in my college years about pizza. We spent just about every night out, me and the boys, which would almost always end at someone's pad with Sports Center and pizza. There would be a ten minute debate, each of us making a case for toppings and our favorite pizza joint, until a consensus was reached and an order was placed. Then we would all dig deep for crumpled bills and pocket change to cover the pie (and a little something for the driver).  I could eat almost a whole pie back then, most of us could. But after a long night of partying and spending  way too much money buying drinks for that cute chick in the corner (who was never going to give me her number anyway), the few bucks we had left wasn't going to get us more than a couple of slices each. So when the pizza finally arrived, it would be half gone by the time the delivery guy closed the door (you didn't want to be the guy paying the driver, trust me).  The funny thing is, back then I don't think it really mattered where we got the pizza from or what we ordered on top. When all was said and done and the grease stained box lay empty on the living room floor, each of us would lie back and sound out a deep, satisfying groan of pleasure, as if we had just devoured the tastiest treat on planet Earth. Night after night, pizza after pizza - and each time with the same satisfying moan and a big smile.  And then one day we suddenly realize (as if the past 20 years caught us asleep at the wheel) that we are actually driving 20 miles across town, through rush hour traffic and lights on a mission to destroy us, all the time conflicted about whether we should even try parking  or just pay the $5 for valet, then zigzagging a half a mile through crowds and crowds of bewildered tourists stopping at every little sparkling thing they see, then up three long  flights of escalators, stuck behind some woman who is clearly unaware that the ocean of perfume she bathed in that day is causing the wallpaper to peel (cough!) -  just to grab a slice from the only place we swear we will ever eat pizza from again.  My how things do change.  So now's the time for some good news - if you live on the West side (or if you're up for a drive) stop by Those Guys Pies. It's everything you used love about Secret Pizza (apparently the guy is over here now), without the hassle that is the Cosmopolitan.",

We were greeted by almost all employees as we walked in. Overwhelmed by the menu, we chose the \"Little Sexy\" sandwich and a cheese/pepperoni pizza. The totally was about $25. Not bad for a full sandwich and pizza. (Not a fan of \"fast food\" pizza.)  The girl who rang us up was great. We took a seat, and noticed they have the episode they were featured on replaying on their tv! I'd be proud too, can't blame 'em.  The owner (I'm guessing) dropped off our food. Everything looked fantastic. The sandwich was rich in flavors, but a little too spicy for me. Good thing my boyfriend ordered it.  The pizza was cooked just right, and melted in your mouth. We were so pleased with the service and food that we decided to order another pizza to go for the family! Very happy with our visit here. Will be back soon for more!",

Big pizza joints on the strip, downtown, etc...close your doors. You can't hold a candle to what they produce at Those Guys Pies.   Here's the story, if you are visiting from the east coast, get in a cab or drive yourself over to the Lakes and grab a pie. If you have never been to the east coast and want a delicious pizza, get to those guys. If you live here and have been dying for great pizza, look no further. I'm telling you this is the place. I live in henderson and will make the trek over and over again.   You have been briefed. Dine accordingly.",

It had plenty of toppings and was cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor!! Also had fried mushrooms (whatever the accompanying sauce is was really good) and my kid had chicken fingers which were awesome, too. Used the coupon for free cinnamon bites (I think that's what they were called) and was surprised at the generous portion. Overall, I'm happy to have finally found a good pizza spot and I will be back again.",

I recommend trying the cheesesteak before anything else. I still need to try a pizza that is more my style with sausage and peppers but my wife ordered a white pie that I gave into and tried a slice of. It wasn't bad, just not my personal favorite toppings for a pizza. The crust on it was good. The mozzarella sticks are made fresh and by hand to order. They have a good amount of gooey cheese and cooked perfectly. My 2nd visit I also tried the 3 cheese fires which looked much better than they sounded and tasted. The fries were cooked right but I would just want cheese whiz on them next time and not the other cheeses. I do wish they had better signage out front. I had a bit of a time finding it and at this time anyway there is nothing on the building saying who they are like the neighboring business in the center. I noticed the specials on their window is the only reason I found it. Solid place with great lunch specials.",

I was impressed they had artichokes - so I asked if our pizza can have artichokes instead of bacon. They said cool, so I was very happy about the easiness of substituting one item.  We get home, and we find out that we received 2 of the White Pizzas. I LOVE white pizza - my kids despise it. I usually take a peek at the pies before bringing them home, but I failed to do so this time.  I made a phone call to Those Guys. Unfortunately, I live 15-20 minutes away and was not going to drive back to show them the pizzas. I tried explaining we have 2 of the same pizzas - I am looking right at them. I tasted a slice from each. They look the same, taste the same - and the person on the phone insists I have 2 different pizzas.   Being a 42 year old Long Island born and raised boy, I kinda know my way around pizza. I promise if a pizza had pepperoni or artichokes on it, I would know it even if I was blind.  I am ok with the Pizza. I would give the pizza 3 1/2 stars of 5. I can appreciate that the pizza tastes like a decent pie. It is middle of the road for quality. When a pizza is wrong, I have no choice but to deduct points. When I am told I have the correct pizza in front of me and it is not, I have to deduct for that also.  I took pictures of both pizzas, and if I can figure out how to add them to this review, they will shown here in just a bit. If someone can find the pepperoni and artichokes and show me that the broccoli rabe is not broccoli rabe, that would be most helpful.",

I  immediately call the store, the owner gets on, starts apologizing, tells me he is firing a new pie for me and will have another one over, in 15 minutes....a fresh, Sausage, Mushroom and Carmelized Onion pizza.... I say great and hang up...  Hold on my wife says...What did you say?? Sausage?  We did not order sausage.  Hold on a minute I say, I grab the receipt, look at it and sure enough....they screwed up the phone order, recording Sausage instead of Pepperoni.  I immediately call the owner back....he answers the phone \"Rick....is this you again?\"  \"Yes,  you are making my pizza wrong, I ordered Pepperoni, not sausage.\"   \"Please do not send me the wrong pizza two times in a row\"  20 minutes later the pizza arrives.  A very polite man delivers the pizza, wants to retrieve the first wrong pizza, to verify the Hawaiian pizza was in fact delivered to me by mistake (like I would make that up), then he offers to verify the pizza being delivered now is the correct one....NOPE!  SAUSAGE!!! I show the delivery guy the paper I ordered the pizza from with my handwriting, the phone number for the store, and the ingredients for our pie....no sausage, just pepperoni, mushrooms and carmelized onions.    He apologizes, tells me the owner will probably call me, do something to make it right...yada yada....that was last Thursday.  As much as I like the pizza, I can find other good pizza around this town.",

    "text": "Ode to the Meatball Parm from Those Guys Pies  A perfect blending of texture and taste, Not a crumb of this sandwich would ever I waste. The bread to slight crunchiness is toasted; The meatballs' incredible flavor is roasted; The sauce is rich from the sun ripe tomato; The cheese is all melty, does not taste like play-doh. Order one now - don't procrastinate! It will be the very best thing you ever ate.  The meatball parmigiana sandwich from Those Guys Pies is just about the most phenomenal thing you can eat on the planet. I had one for dinner the first time 2 nights ago. And then for the rest of the night, I could not shut up about how good it was. So I ordered another for dinner yesterday, but this time, I concentrated really, really hard, so that I could use real words in my review instead of just saying \"yum yum.\" (I concentrated so hard that a poem popped out!) The bread is sturdy enough to hold up to its hearty contents, but it's not tough or anything that you feel you are ripping apart with your teeth. It doesn't have remarkable flavor on its own, but that's fine, because you don't really want it competing with the rest of the mouthwatering taste sensations. It is a perfect canvas for the food art laid atop. The home-made meatballs have superb flavor, and you can see within the herbs that are used in its making. They are dense enough to have good bite. (As in, not fluffy, like when people use breadcrumbs as filler.) I also like the sauce. It is bright and flavorful, but not too fruity or acidic. But  we must not forget to mention the BRILLIANT way this sandwich is crafted - in the way they lay the meat on the bread. Mark my words, it is such a remarkable idea that I have no doubt in a few years, all meatball parms will be made this way. Instead of your typical 3 or so meatballs tucked into the bread - you know, so that sometimes the uneaten part of a ball rolls out of the bun and into your lap - they slice the meat and angle it so that there's no rolling action, and the amount of meat you get with each bite is fairly consistent. Genius. I took a picture that I will upload in a second. I hope you can see it with this review so that you will see what I mean.   Although I just recently tried the meatball parm, I've actually eaten here about 15 times. Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I'm from Jersey (New, that is), and I have been looking for a great pie (pizza, that is) in Vegas for over a decade. I feel pretty confident saying this is the best in the whole city. (Which, by extension, really means the best in southern Nevada.)  Pizza: Crust is thin like it should be. Our usual order is the sausage & pepperoni pie. Awesome every time. One time I ordered a veggie pie, no cheese, for a vegan friend, and it was the best damn veggie pie I ever had. (Although to be honest, I didn't ask about the crust ingredients, so it may not have been vegan. Please don't tell my friend.) I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it wasn't just the standard pepper, onion, mushroom, tomato. Maybe they added artichoke hearts? I don't know, but the point is, it was mouthwatering.  Cheesesteak: I have also had this sandwich a couple of times. It comes with onions at no extra charge, but I order \"The Works\" to add on peppers & mushrooms an extra $1. It's fantastic. I do think it's a little pricey for a sandwich, (I think the ribeye is $11, which makes the works $12). But - the meat is thinly sliced, and not chewy, like you get with cheaper meat that has a lot of fat and gristle. I can't stand meat that I can't bite through. I know not everyone agrees, but I would rather pay the extra to enjoy my sandwich instead of fighting with it.    Chicken Fingers: very good. The chicken is moist, the breading is good. I can't say there is anything that needs to be improved about them, I just find it hard to get excited about chicken fingers. If you love Raising Cane's, I'm sure you will love these too. The thing that stands out about them is that they are much, much longer than usual. Fun variety in sauces, too.  I might have to get another meatball parm for dinner tonight, for the third day in a row. Seriously, this sandwich is that good.",

The guys working were great, and I love that they offered  mozzarella, onion powder, pepper flakes and oregano to go.   That said, the cheese pizza we had was just okay. We were hoping for a thinner crust, more grease to be sitting on top of the cheese, and the sauce to be tangier.   We are still in search of a great NY style pizza here in Vegas. Hope we can find it.",

    "text": "I have been dying to go here and check out the east coast pizza vibe. I have not had a good chicken fingers sub in years.  Saw this joint on DDD, I finally committed to drive out to west bum excited to try this place out. Heading back to Southern Cal from Utah the place is not close to the route home, but today was the day my son and I stepped up.  It's small,  a couple tables, geared for take out local.  Having been on the road I had to pee and they don't have bathroom, frustrating.     To be fair, the  food is better than 2 stars but service and the mistakes made me rank it 2 stars overall.    After waiting several minutes (Ignored) at the register to order. I ordered a small cheese pizza and a chicken fingers hoagie (Sub) it comes with lettuce, tomato and mayo, I added and paid extra for provolone. After a long wait, They had  burnt the first pizza (more wait) and had to cook another one. We got a plain cheese and It ended up tasting good.  After a wait, my sub showed up with no mayo, no cheese. It came dry with lettuce and ??? sun dried tomatoes??? I gave up, waited for the pizza and ate my sub asking for a side of mayo to spread myself. I let the cheese go and picked out the dry tomatoes.   This place is a local take out place, if your not on the west side of Vegas, it's not with the trip. I kicked in an extra star because the food was decent but I won't go back. Not with the trip. Sorry Guys, I wanted to love it.",

I suggest calling to order ahead for pick up, although my sandwich was made on the spot and didn't take long to get.  The price tag was a little hefty, but it is definitely the best in town.",

We ordered the Maui Wowie Pizza, an Original Cheesteak sandwich a order of wings and a 2 liter bottle of soda. The total was just over $40.00  The guy who took the order over the phone was friendly, the delivery guy was friendly. The food arrived in about 30 minutes.  As far as the food goes, for the price,  I was hoping it would be tastier than it was.  The wings and sandwich were pretty good. I wasn't as impressed with the pizza.   It wasn't bad, but I really wasn't overly impressed. I'll probably try it again at some point in the future.",

Called it in for pick up since we knew from other Yelpers they have only 1 table,  polite easy ordering via phone. The pizza place wasn't too hard to find, it's tucked away behind Citibank off of West Sahara.  I'm sure they don't get too many drive by customers though. I've been wanting to try their Cheesesteak Pie since I've heard about them. With the red sauce, No shrooms we don't dig the fungi. The staff was very friendly and chatted with my husband while we waited for the pie. They give you little cups of oregano, garlic, red peppers and grated cheese with your pie.  The pizza was delicious, not my favorite in town but a contender. Loved the crust, it had tons of cheese and was close to an actual cheesesteak taste. My only complaint is their red sauce, I was glad the pizza didn't have a lot of it. I just wasn't a big fan, can't quite put my finger on why.  But I'm weird with my sauce preferences. Prices are about on track with most quality pizza places. Can't wait to go back, Looking forward to trying their white pizza and original cheesesteak which I'm hearing good things about.",

It was heaven to that boy and for the last 20 years he has been trying to find a western region version close to that perfect bite.  Those Guys Pies comes awfully close.  Led by Roy Bass, who helped start Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, Those Guys Pies not only makes superb pizza but excellent cheesesteak (Roy hails from Cherry Hill, just a skimming stone away from Philly), and even homemade mozzarella sticks.  The ingredients are fresh and clearly Roy and his partner in crime put east coast love into their creations.  My one regret is they do not serve slices at night.  Still, leftover pizza will be good in the morning :)  Enjoy the pie with the transplanted east coaster Seal of Approval.",

The bread was fresh and soaked in the juices from the meat and fixings. They quantity of the sandwich was definitely a two meal amount as well. If we lived closer to this place this would be in our regular rotation of take out for sure. The people there were pleasant and the restaurant has a cozy east coast appeal. I can't wait to try their pizza!",

I ordered the meat pie, as I was intrigued about their house made sausage, bacon, and meatballs. Unfortunately, I didn't care too much for the pizza. It wasn't bad, but for me it was just a notch above big chain pizza. Sauce, cheese, crust, toppings - all was just average.  I would rate it 3 stars for the pizza, but I put 4 because I really enjoyed the cheese steak here. I will come back for that, but not for the pizza.",

Its got a great location because there's a man-made lake just around the corner. Yes, a lake...in Vegas. Water instantly adds a feeling of serenity when large bodies of it are near.   The portions are stellar and the scent of Italian spices, roasted tomatoes, and fresh dough are what will fill your olfactory nerves when you open the door. As if the nearby lake isn't a soothing sensation enough, the Parisian scents of pasta and pizza will hit you like a Rocky 1-2 combo...but, in a good way.",

First off the pizza was delicious, my favorite part was the bacon though. After we had our fill of the pizza we opened the poppers and were amazed at how much we got, they also were very good. The frosting reminded me of Cinnabon's.  Definitely gonna order from here again.   Only downside about this place is finding it for your first time. it's in the back of the lot and if there's a car parked out front you can't see the store sign on the window.",

They have a few tables to sit in, but this is mostly a carry out or delivery place.  We sat in (party of three) and the people working there were great. Nice and friendly. We left an extra tip for the great service. I learned about this place on DDD and I was not disappointed. We are back and forth from the east coast and vegas regularly and we will be sure to visit this place again. We are in Southern Highlands so it's about a 20-25 minute drive.

I was finally able to try their pie right out of their Lakes location and man, have I been missing out.   My husband and I ordered a half Maui Wowie(bacon, pineapple and jalapenos) and half pepperoni pie to split. A few minutes of waiting and it came piping hot, straight out of the oven. The crust was absolute perfection when it came to taste and texture. The sauce is really good and a nice amount that doesn't overpower the other ingredients. It's also not overly tart like some pizza sauces I've tried. The pepperoni topping was really good but pretty standard but the bacon on the Maui wowie was excellent. It was large crispy bacon, not the canadian bacon you see at other pizza joints. I only wish there was more of this yummy porky goodness on the pie.  The store was small and easy to miss because it still didn't have overhead signage. There's a small counter to order from, a couple of chairs and a table which was overtaken by bags of condiments. This is a takeout place. There are no heat lamps at this joint. Call ahead or order your pie fresh and wait. Take the pie home, eat in your car or find an empty table by the fake lake nearby. They also provide a delivery service within 5 miles but I suggest coming down to say hi and experience the pizza hot out of the oven. It's totally worth it. Dare I say this may be the best pizza in Vegas.",

For a place that prides itself on pizza and boasts the Food Network card, I really expected a pie that would impress me over any other pizza I've had (and I've had quite a few). If a cheese pizza cant be made well, to me, that tells the whole story. Get wings and a pie from Tap House and then this place. You'll taste the difference.",

I would understand if they just opened and haven't got their rhythm yet but they've been open for 6 years. The pizzas looked pretty good but who wants to wait 45-60 minutes to get their food!",

    "text": "If you've read a couple of my posts, you've noticed that I like to go eat at places featured on television. Especially Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This is another of those places. The fact that they serve pizzas and cheese steaks didn't hurt my desire to go.  My wife and I ate cheese steaks for lunch. I had thought of taking half of mine to work that night. Bad idea. Ate the whole thing for lunch.  I ate what is called \"The Works\". A ten inch thinly shaved rib-eye with onions, mushrooms, green peppers and in this case, provolone cheese.  My wife had \"Italian Steak\". A ten inch shaved rib-eye with caramelized onions, broccoli rabe, and provolone cheese\".  Dining in is not the best of options, only a few tables, the place is very small.  When you walk in you will notice one television, with only one show being aired.  The show is Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives. I mentioned to my wife that it would be funny if this were the episode that features Those Guys Pies. Sure enough that was the episode that was showing. After that episode, it ran again. Coincidence? I think not. As we were putting on our coats to depart, the cook, owner, guy you see on television with Guy thanked us for stopping by, and made a little chat. I happened to notice while eating how hard he worked, how messy his work apron was.   That's what I like, a cook who had a messy apron !",

The crust was very good, however the Margherita was really just regular cheese and the White Ricotta pizza was missing those iconic globs of Ricotta. It was bit heavy on the garlic, however all in all a decent pizza. It's certainly not the best I've had. My rating was a gift, my understanding is they are well known for their Philly Cheese sandwiches and they like what they do. My favorite is still Bambino's",

    "text": "My cheesesteak sandwich experiences are limited to my university's on-campus grill (American cheese oozing over a pile of grilled onions and beef on overly greasy cardboard, ahem, flavorless soggy chewy bread) and Amato's Cheesesteaks in the Bay Area. Amato's has a great reputation, but we always got it to go and it would be steaming in the paper wrapper for about 25 minutes. Fast forward to our trip to Las Vegas, where I read about Those Guys Pies in one of the Las Vegas magazines. Take a bite. Close your eyes. Chew and savor and repeat. This stuff is pure heaven, or at least I hope heaven is a place filled with delicious cheesesteaks and pies from Those Guys Pies.   I ordered The Works Cheesesteak with a hug and photo-op. The freshly baked flavorful yeasty bread was stuffed with a ridiculous amount of deliciously marinated tender certified Angus beef rib-eye with grilled onions, mushroom, green bell peppers and white American cheese and then placed in the hot pizza oven for a crispety crunchety exterior and piping hot interior. Sooooo gooood. Amazing. Mind-blowing. Life-changing. And then there was the pizza. Thin and chewy high quality crust with crisp edges and lots of flavor (I hate bland crust), topped by the most amazing red sauce, delicious mozzarella cheese and yummy housemade sausage! Since we ordered a half and half, the halves were composed carefully, leaving a strip down the middle that did not have any meat or veggies.  We were going to eat once we got back to the house, but the smell was making me hungry, so we ate in the car instead. My lap was used as a tabletop; thankfully Las Vegas Weekly saved the super hot pizza from burning the top of my thighs. I burned my mouth on that piping hot first slice! After the searing pain, my taste buds encountered immense pleasure. Yummmmm. Hello, best ever pizza and cheesesteak in Las Vegas. Totes Amaze! You must try this place!",

Its mostly kitchen, but since he makes all his sauces in house I didn't mind at all.  The first trip we ordered the BBQ Maui Wowie pizza, that was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives with Guy Fieri. My wife ordered the chicken Parm Sandwich.  Everything was made to order from the stretching of the dough, to the hand cut and breaded chicken.  We engaged in a great conversation with the co-owner Roy, and got to hear about his culinary ladder he climbed and how started Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, to where he is today being his own boss.  Amazing guy.  It didn't take long for our food to arrive. Both our pizza and sandwich were piping hot out of the oven.  Upon first bite of the pizza, it was like a flavor explosion with the 50/50 tangy BBQ/pizza sauce, the little heat from the pickled jalapeno, the sweet of the pineapple, and the savory of the pulled pork, and the saltiness from the bacon. MMMMM, it is what pizza dreams are made of.  Her sandwich was amazing as well with the toasted sub roll, pizza sauce, and melty cheese.  The chicken itself was very tasty due the amazing breading.  The second time, she got the chicken parm again, but I got the original cheesesteak with onions, and white american.  The cheesesteak was one of the best i've had with great seasoned meat and the toasted roll. And her chicken parm was amazing again.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in town. Thanks to Roy and his crew for the awesome stories, and the amazing food.",

If you order for pick-up, your wait time is around 25 minutes.  Despite the delivery snafus, we keep ordering from them because their pizza is great, their cheese sticks are pretty good, and their chicken wings and chicken tenders are the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!  The wings are always perfectly cooked (even after waiting forever for delivery!) and the tenders remind me of the tenders at Strip n Dip.  They have a large selection of sauces for their chicken; our favorite is the thai peanut... YUM!  They make/cure their own meats and I don't really have a taste for them, but they are high quality and flavorful.  I'm more of a cheese or pepperoni pizza fan, myself.  Their dough is thin, but the crust is just the right amount of thickness- so chewy!    The prices are slightly higher than your average pizza joint, but quite frankly, their food is the best delivery option out there for pizza and wings- everywhere else is not worth the price or calories.  Their fried cinnamon poppers are pretty good, too!",

My family and I have ordered from them four times now, each time ordering something else, and I can't find a negative thing to say. So I have now tried the pizza, wings, mozzarella sticks, salads, I'm now going to try the cheesesteaks. I have a feeling I won't be disappointed...",

Called ahead to order for pick up, was told it would be 15-20 minutes, I get there in 25 minutes, and my pizza hadn't even been put in the oven. The kid at the front assured me it would only be 10 minutes, well it took another 25 minutes. I got a car full of groceries and frozen food, as well as a tired and hungry, crying, infant. I understand if it's buisy, but don't lie to people and tell them 15-20 minute wait, when it's more like an hour. good pies, HORRIBLE SERVICE!",

Oh and the white pies....muahh  I also have to say their cheese-steaks are so amazing.  Also after my 4th delivery the owner came out personally to thank me for my business. Cmon, even if the food was mediocre this would be enough to keep me ordering.  Thanks Those Guys Jillyin",

We decided to give them another go before this Packers game this weekend and we confirmed that we will never order from this establishment again. We ordered at 1:20 in the afternoon and the follow up email saying our order will be ready by 2:08. At 2:45 we call Those Guys to cancel the order and the guy I speak to on the phone tries to guilt me into not cancelling because his \"drive is like a block away\" -- keep in mind, I live 10 minute from Those Guys. When I don't give in and tell him to keep the order, he literally hangs up on me. I call back to speak to a manager and apparently, the man I was speaking to was the owner. Totally unacceptable customer service for an order that hadn't arrived 40 minutes AFTER the original 48 minute wait time.",

    "text": "This review is hard to write simply because the owner (?) righted the wrong. Here's what happened: 508PM -- We call Those Guys and order a large pizza. We asked how long the pizza would take to deliver since we needed to feed the babies (1 year olds). Roy let me know that the pizza would take about 15 minutes to cook and, since there was one delivery ahead of us, another 10 for the delivery. 25 minutes to go less than one mile, so we asked for delivery. 558PM -- No pizza. We called back to see if everything was ok with the delivery guy (we were hoping he hadn't been in an accident or anything) and was assured that the delivery guy would be at our door any minute. 612PM -- Still no pizza. We called again and were told that Roy was going to check up on his delivery guy. Something about car trouble. 625PM -- Still no pizza. This is now over an hour past the time we called to order. We called again. This was getting ridiculous and now the kids have already eaten something else. Here is where Roy kinda redeemed himself -- he said if the pizza wasn't at our house in 5 minutes, it was on him. Well, it wasn't. 645PM -- Our pizza finally arrived, with no apology from the delivery guy. Had we known it would have taken this long to get the pizza, we would have driven the 5 minutes ourselves to pick it up.  Now, the pizza. We ordered a large half cheese and half mushroom and olive. When it got to us, it was warm, not hot. This may have something to do with the mediocre taste. We only ordered from this restaurant because of the great Yelp reviews. But, given the time it took to arrive at our house and the blah taste factor, I doubt we'll order again. Maybe if we're desperate....",

They were absolutely delicious and the sauces to choose from was a major decision maker for me. I ordered the Hot Buffalo sauce (one of the best traditional buffalo sauces I've ever had), the Blue cheese sauce (one of the best blue cheese sauces I've ever had), the Maple Mustard sauce (Delicious) and the Thai Peanut sauce (Also delicious). Other Yelpers are right, these are definitely some of the best chicken tenders in Vegas. Also, I'm a sucker for a good cheesesteak and these cheesesteaks are great!  I ordered mine with provolone (because cheese whiz kind of creeps me out), peppers and onions. They're HUGE and the meat is excellent. I'm excited to order pizza next time and now I have a solid place to get cheesesteaks and tenders from, to-go. I ordered online at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthoseguyspies.com&s=4d870cd9f596e2e3a1775cf5d7606ac99b2ddec95990054118e9f549e791fce8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thoseguyspies.com</a>, didn't have to call and had a speedy and professional delivery. I am now an avid supporter and fan. How was this place hiding in my backyard and I didn't even know?! My only complaint is that I wasn't privy to this place's existence sooner!",

The sandwich came out and then boom it was piping hot and delicious. I've tasted cheesesteaks from food courts around vegas but nothing beats this one. The ribeye is so juicy and well seasoned and the cheese was a great. The bread was alright I wish it was steamed or something cause it was cold.

We decided to eat in anyway as we were driving around all day and were pretty hungry. The meatball was very good, perfect amount of cheese and sauce on a toasted roll. I also had some of my wife's chicken finger hoagie. They load up the chicken, smother the bread with mayo and add lettuce(with dressing) on top. The bread makes their sandwiches! They are really fresh rolls with great flavors. I would stop in if over this way for sure",

The gentleman who took our order answered our questions about the menu and made recommendations on food options, although everything on the menu look delicious. We ended up ordering \"The Works cheesesteak,\" wings and fries with a side of cheese wiz and TGP sauce (so yummy). We waited about 10 minutes for our food in the small but accommodating dining area. The gentleman who took our order brought out our food which was hot and ready to eat. The wings and fries were perfectly golden brown with the hot sauce on the side. The cheesesteak is perfect for 2 but so amazingly delicious you will probably want to have it all to yourself. Overall TGP was amazingly tasty and will return for more. Can't wait to try their pizza pies. PLEASE TRY THE TGP SAUCE!",

    "text": "If this were not the best cheesesteak I've eaten in Las Vegas I would be giving it 1 star.   I didn't realize the place was really a carry out spot.  There is NOTHING wrong with being a carry out.  I drove to here thinking I could sit down at eat and relax.  While this is \"technically\" possible.  It's not.   They should suggest that takeout and delivery is the most preferred method for this eatery.    There are 3 tables you can sit at.  The place is very hot, kitchen music is loud, and there are no bathrooms.  Not sure how you can have seating for guests without a bathroom but I digress.   So after quickly understanding my situation I decided to order my food to go.    I came here specifically to order the Italian Steak.  I remember eating the original Tony Luke version in Philly and thought it would be great to reminisce.  I placed my order and paid.   A few minutes later I was told they had no broccoli rabe.  That's the ENTIRE reason I ordered the steak.    It would have been nice for the person to tell me this before taking my payment.   The person said he could put spinach as a substitute.   (sad but what's a person to do)   If you plan to order from this establishment please understand the \"dining room\" isn't really a place you can enjoy, relax, and take in the food.   Plan on ordering the food to go.  Unless you enjoy dining at a place described the former of my review.    The steak truly was the absolute best steak I've had in my short 17 years of living in Las Vegas.   Because the food was so damn good I will overlook the negatives of my trip to Those Guy's Pies.   I could only imagine how delicious it could have been if it were served as ordered...Broccoli Rabe.",

Called 55 min later and they said delivery will be made any minute and to call back if it doesn't get delivered within 10min. Called back 15min later, and they said we'll call the deliver guy right now. Seriously? it takes them a 2nd call to check on the delivery?? Pizza eventually arrived an hour and half after i placed the order--that's double the time i was quoted! if things couldn't get worst, pizza was completely cold, stale and had formed grease pools, and all sides were forgotten AGAIN. They forgot our sides on the last two orders too, and their delivery guy never has at least some crushed peppers in his car... called them right away, and no answer. Called the delivery guy right after, and asked him to please come back and return my money and take their pizza back. Nothing for 15min, so i called the store again and asked for a manager. Manager get's on the phone and i tell him what's wrong. He apologized and said they are busy, and when i told him that it's not okay to take an order when you are too busy to honor the time you quote and then deliver a cold pizza for $30. He said \"you are right, but i have other business to attend to right now\"... excuse me??? Well Sir, f*** you and your professional ethics then, because this is the last time I gave TGP my business! This place is not even worthy of the 1 star minimum required to leave a review.",

Then at 12:44, nearly 20 min late, they call to tell me they'll be another 45 min to an hour late on top of that!  We better get a refund...  This is unacceptable.  Update:  Okay, so when I talked to them, I felt bad because they seemed to have become popular in a short amount of time, and had just not figured out how to grow/evolve yet, to handle it.  We decided to give them another try (this time pickup instead of delivery), and I'm so glad we did!  It turns out, the reason for the influx of customers is due their recent debut on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  After the airing of their place on the show last Sunday, business exploded, and they haven't had time to adjust to it.    We ordered a half pepperoni, half Greek pizza, cheese-steak hoagie, and fries.  ALL of it was delicious and hot.  It was a bit of a wait, but we knew that going into it, and since we didn't have to depend on a delivery that would never come, it was a lot less frustrating.  It's our new go-to spot for pizza and cheese-steaks... well... our go-to when we can afford to wait a little bit, or at least plan ahead a little.",

They had numerous others to sample, but didn't get a chance to have a bite. That sample def made me want to enjoy more of what they have to offer. If you haven't had their pizza you're missing out!  The only bummer is that they don't deliver to the southwest side as their delivery radius is 5 miles.",

I had my favorite: buffalo chicken sandwich (I am obsessed with buffalo sauce, I can drink it) and added an order of French fries. For $2.50 you get a mountain of fries. No joke. And, they are Perfectly seasoned. On point.   My sandwich was incredible; juicy, well seasoned and drenched in delicious sauce. It was also topped with onions. I am obsessed with those too.   One thing that is a Big Fail with my meal tonight are the chicken strips. Half of them were RAW inside. I ate around and what I could but that was absolutely unappetizing and gross. I was really bummed out. One half of the sandwich was mostly good and the other was mostly inedible.   Come on guys... Rookie mistake.",

What makes them different from the rest is that a lot of their toppings are house made. I am unfortunately sensitive to dairy but I will still cheat sometimes when my boyfriend orders from here. They never skimp toppings and their cheesesteaks are always filled and smothered in cheese wiz if you ask for it that way. I love their shroom pizza on white cheese. It is so good!!

It's not a bad pizza but I don't think it lived up to the reviews.  A real east coast pizza slice should stand up to the moisture.  The dough lacks that wonderful yeast flavor and the cheese was nothing special.  The spinach was MIA but there were tons of mushrooms so not a deal breaker.  The crust was cooked through and wasn't burned but I wish it had some flavor.  There was very little sauce and that's a good thing considering it would have made it even more soggy.  All that said I will give them one more chance.  The pizza is pricey but I would pay more for an excellent pie.",

So I jumped on yelp and typed in our zip code and entered pizza delivery and picked the first thing that popped up, which was here. We got the big sexy not only because I sounded amazing but because thats all everyone talks about besides the cheesesteaks. It arrived very quickly and smelled oh so amazing so we chowed down. I was very surprised how large it was I was completely satisfied with one slice (they are very very large slices) I love how everything was evenly distributed, each slice had equal amounts. I was very impressed being from NY and all, the crust was amazing. I can't wait to check out other pizza from here and their cheesesteaks!",

    "text": "I have to say after seeing them on DDD I was expecting to be blown away with these pies. I was sadly wrong and highly disappointed. To begin the place is so small there is only two tables to sit at. The over all appearance is not very clean or organized. You are not greated as you walk in and almost not even noticed. Had to get up and waited about 5 minutes before someone finally came to take my order. They offer no fountain drinks but bottled so you end up spending more than expected. My son needed to use the restroom and was told we had to go to another restaurant down the way to use their bathroom... How ridiculous! Once receiving the food the fingers were great but the pie was soaked in grease and just did not look anything worthy of being on DDD. To then encounter no cups for my kids to share a bottled drink, no silverware to cut up smaller slices definitely ruined the experience even more. Was not impressed with the pie at all due to lack of flavor and the crust was burnt. I will not be back to try and have them redeem themselves at all. The only perks of my visit was the some what friendly service we received even though I had to get everything I needed. Also, received a discount for being military. We did notice that if you become regulars you receive your meals for free. Witnessed twice between two different customers. I guess that's a perk if you choose to continue to go back. The chicken wings must have been good employees were back there stuffing their faces with them and also heard them making pies for themselves and their friends... Guess that's another perk of working for this pie company.",

Hard to find in the dark.  Ordered about $70 worth of food (Maui Wowie Pizza a few cheesteaks & fingers.  I even put a tip on the bill ahead of time.  Was told it would be about a 20-25 minute wait.  The front door was left open, which left the inside waiting area very cold.  There was another party that came in after us and was served their food shortly after ordering, which irritated me a bit.  We were not communicated with at all during our waiting time.  No \"sorry about the wait\" or \"your food will be done shortly\".... Instead, 42 minutes later, we were given our food, after asking for it.  Pizza was cold by the time we got home.  I didn't notice anything special about the pizza.  In my opinion it lacked toppings.  20-25 minutes vs. 42 minutes for an overpriced pizza ($26) and cheesesteaks ($12 each)?  I could have purchased almost 3 pizzas from Costco for the price of one pizza here.  Just wish we would have been acknowledged a bit while we visited and maybe have the associates smile once in a while.  We considered Capriotti's prior to coming here... Probably should have.

I ordered the mozzarella sticks to try - not the best but not terrible, a Chicken Cesar Salad which for $10 because of the chicken my biggest disappointment was I felt it was overpriced for what it truly was. Everyone makes their Cesar a little different but if this one had less lettuce and more oomph I would have enjoyed it more. Add on some tomato slices or shredded cheese, again it needs more oomph and less lettuce I literally felt like I paid $10 for a box full of lettuce and a piece of chicken sliced up. Last I ordered the cheesecake as I read here on yelp that it is apparently amazing but unfortunately they were \"all out\" according to my delivery lady, she did however refund me for the missing dessert and offer me a free cannoli and as I appreciated the respect they have for their customers when they can't fulfill an order - I gave that money right back to her as a tip to say thank you.",

I've been to all of the other places some of the other people posting mention, Grimaldi's, Don DiMarcos, Roccos, Verazanos, etc., and NOTHING touches this place!!  The customer service is outstanding and their delivery is usually pretty quick.  I highly recommend, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Ok. Where do I start? With the oh-my-god-these-are-the-best-chicken-fingers-I've-ever-had-in-my-mouth? With their amazingly delicious Italian breadcrumb coating deep fried to perfection? But, wait! There's more. The sauces...IPA buffalo? Pineapple buffalo? Garlic Parmesan? The best fingers hands down, anywhere. I just can't imagine anyone making them any better.  I was going to save the pizza review for last because I thought it was the best thing on the menu. But, after tonight's surprise cheesesteak, I'm torn. The pizza, for us, was the main draw. It's virtually perfect. The crust is thin, crispy but with that little bit of chew. The toppings are unlike any other pizza joint...they house make the bacon, the sausage & the meatball. HOUSEMADE  PEOPLE, HOUSE MADE! An Italian white pizza with mozzarella, ricotta & broccoli rabe, who else is making a takeout/delivery pizza at that caliber? It's takeout pizza on a whole other level.  Now, on to the cheesesteak. We're west coast people, born & raised in San Diego and  we just never quite got the craze for cheesesteak. It's good, but we've never been wowed. Well, last night we were sent home from Those Guys Pies with an original cheesesteak. Ribeye. Onions. American Cheese. Cheesewhiz. It blew us away. It was perfection. It wasn't just a cheesesteak, it was an experience! The reason we weren't \"cheesesteak people\" is because we had never had a real cheesesteak done right. Now, we can't wait til our next cheesesteak, but only from TGP!    There you have it. People, you need to get to Those Guys Pies and try everything. Those guys know more than just perfect pizzas!! Happy Eating!!",

There is one down fall is the lack of seating,  practically none, I mean only 1 table.  So If  planning on eating  here it's not going to happen,  you will have to take if home or eat in the car. The quality of the food and a great staff make up for the lack of seating.  I will definitely  be back.",

I'm a dedicated customer and loyal to what I find......that being said I have been here for 2.5 yrs and after seeing Those Guys on Triple D......today after work I thought what the hell.....I'll give it a try.  After all the Triple D show made this place look so so good..........Well....another review used the phrase \"train wreck \"......lol.....I think I was in the caboose of that train as it came off the tracks !    I took a friend there......very small......very ! .......we ordered 2 salads , 1 pizza , an order of wings and had 2 iced teas out of the cooler. We had to ask for a couple glasses and ice....no straws.....then after waiting and no offer of even water....out comes the pizza.....then the salads....then wings.......timing was just awful ! The salads  came in a to go container.....it was just ok....just thrown together and to much crappie dressing dumped on top. The pizza......well....Dajorno would have been an improvement  !!!!! Awful taste.....crappie crust ! Then the wings....omg.....plain old wings deep fried in a basket and 2 little plastic to go cups with dips. I have to say.......the WORST wings I've ever had !!!     I should have known better......most Triple D places I go to are dumps and poor food, and this place was no different!  Save yourself the gas and stomach and forget this place. I will stick with my fav Vegas pizza.....Dom Demarcos. .....now that's some good pie !",

This was a large serving and was DRENCHED in cheese...awesome! I split the cheesesteak and fries with Eva, and we still weren't able to finish everything!

There's a lot of pizza options in Las Vegas, but this place remains one of the go to places in my husband's mind. Although we are slightly out of their delivery range, they let us know they'll deliver to us during slower periods (which is super nice of them), but we also have just picked-up here as well. When they have delivered, they did so in a timely manner and food was still fresh. I'm a big fan of their ooey-gooey but still crispy cheese fries, but their Philly cheesesteak just wasn't for me (meat wasn't seasoned well). You can't go wrong with their pizzas - we usually opt for a white pizza and pepperoni. And if they have it, you must get their cheesecakes - truly heaven in a foil container. They do have very limited seating inside the store, but I would suggest getting take-out.",

When we walked in we're not greeted, we sat down and waited for 5 min until I figured that i had to get my own menu front the front. Waited.....until my husband asked if they were coming to our table or us having to order at the front. The young guy at the front said that we had to order at the front desk, which is a foot away from the table. There's only 2 tables, it's a tiny restaurant. There's No water front view or AC. It was hot, i guess its because you are right next to the kitchen and either it wasn't on or ut wasn't working. We order a large pizza and Mozzarella sticks. The pizza/pie was not that great. I was not impressed, I was expecting something great and delicious and all I got was an average pizza with very little flavor. The mozzarella sticks were ok.  This was my first and last time here. I trutly believe its all hype thanks to DDD, maybe at some point it was great and now that they are more famous they are lacking flavor and love for the food that they are making.",

But, if I were to do it again, I would order a large pizza, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, and heat up individual slices on aluminum foil (or a pizza stone) for 5 minutes at 475*F. Something magical happens. Sounds crazy, but I actually enjoy Those Guys Pies twice as much on the reheat. It becomes perfectly crispy and chewy, as real pizza should be.  Not all pizza reacts this way. But real NJ/NY pizza does. (This is meant to be a compliment to Those Guys Pies.)  Give it try. Experience the alchemy.",

    "text": "I've been here a total of two times. Once because i couldn't decide on what to eat and just ordered it from home to pick up. Second time was way more recent, still couldn't decide on what to eat, and ordered it on yelp to pick up after i swung by my friends house to pick up something.   Yelp/GrubHub or w/e the service is to order through yelp, had estimated it to be like 50-60 minutes before I get my order. I had originally called and wanted to cancel the order if the wait was that long because i was trying to swing by and get it on the way home. Whoever had picked up the phone had told me it was going to take like 15 minutes. Oh? Nice ! And off to the restaurant i went to pick up.   This restaurant is located in northeast-ish side of 'The Lakes'. It's midly hidden even in the shopping center it is in. Since i was like 5 minutes away, i sat at the restaurant maybe 10 minutes before i got my pizza. Fairly on point with the estimation ! Thanks ! The restaurant itself is really small. Maybe room for i think like 2 tables and some chairs. Rest of it was the kitchen.   So onto the food. Both times i had gotten the \"Italian White Pie\" that is listed under their 'Specialty House Pie' category. The Italian White Pie includes ricotta, mozzarella, broccoli rabe, sausage, garlic, and carmelized onions on a white pizza. What makes it a white pizza is not using the \"usual\" tomato sauce but a white cream sauce, probably similar to like an alfredo sauce. cream and cheese based.   The first time i got the 'Italian White Pie', it was awkwardly mildly too salty. Which was surprising for a pizza. I decided to give it another try and this time, it was PERFECT ! Crust was nice and thin but crispy. Good amounts of ricotta and mozzarella which gave it a nice amount of creaminess and cheesiness. The sausage was thinly cut so you get more then a pebble worth on each slice. Carmelized onions add such a nice savoriness and sweetness overall. Next time something i'd change is EXTRA GARLIC ! yeah i just love garlic. why not have more garlic?! mmm hehe maybe the onions too. The broccoli rabe adds a nice green color and a \"crispness\" to it all aside from the crust, since everything else was nice and soft.   The italian white pie is just so good, i dont know if i can try anything else. I just love everything about it ! Maybe if they can throw on some peppers to give it a nice spicy kick, then it would be 100%",

I tried the original cheesesteak wit whiz and it was \"ok\" due to lack of seasoning. It was filling to say the least, and the ribeye was tender, but just not as flavorful as I expected.  On the pizza side, we had the spicy italian red and it wasn't spicy. It was greasy (yeah, I know sausage will make it greasy) although the crust was very good. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would probably eat here again, but I would not drive from the strip for it.",

So far I have tried a majority of their pies, all white sauces and WOW. Not to mention anything that comes out of their fryer is also always amazing.They truly outshine any other delivery services around here.

    "text": "Not sure why, but even after ordering from here about 4-5 times I still kind of hesitate to write a review about Those Guys... it's like I can't quite decide about this place. Their pizzas are pretty good, have tried several combinations. Last being the big sexy which was surprisingly WAY spicy (too spicy for my husband to even eat any) and seemed like they skimped a little in the cheese department. The first time we ordered  I remember thinking the pizza was way too garlicky, which you if you know me you'd know that's almost an impossible feat to use too much garlic. Their wings are really good, but their sauces are what makes them great. I give their TGP sauce (sriracha aioli) 5+ stars, I was dipping everything in it, including my daughters chicken fingers and the mozzarella sticks LOL. On that note, their chicken fingers are really quite good. The first time we ordered they were way over seasoned with either italian seasoning or oregano, so I thought they were actually kind of gross, but this last time they were really very good. My husband had the philly cheesesteak and he said it was pretty good. I ordered the spinach salad time before last and it was a pretty big disappointment. There was so much slimy spinach, it was actually kind of hard to eat. I picked a lot of it out and ate what I could, so I think if they washed and checked their spinach and used a better dressing it would actually be a great salad - but I personally would not order it again. Their jalapeno peppers are good and have also had the shroom on white pizza which was good too. So all in all, I think it's a good pizza place. Nothing that screams great (except maybe the wings in TGP sauce) but I'm sure we'll be ordering here on a fairly regular basis.",

Now I always get white shroom and I'm happy with it. I like the regular white pizza too.  What I don't like is the attitude of Roy the owner who took my order. Not everyone working there acts like him- the rest are friendly and polite. I told him about my house salad soaked in dressing and I was unable to eat it and he didn't do anything about it except said he will put my dressing on the side the next time.

It's a tiny shop with virtually no room to dine in. Take out or delivery are your only options. Specializing in New York-style pies, you'll find crusts with a good balance of crispiness and chew that are slightly blistered. I've been meaning to try their red sauce, but their white pies are so good I haven't passed them up. My usual order has been an 18\" white pie ($22) with added caramelized onions, pepperoni, and mushrooms. The 'shroom pie with the white sauce wasn't bad either, full of a variety of mushrooms. Service has been friendly and efficient, even during peak hours. For take out, Those Guys has become my go-to place for a quick-fix of pizza.  4.5 Stars",

Couldn't stand the heat inside so had to wait for the order in the heat outside. It was way overpriced. The philly was small and not great but the biggest disappointment was the pizza. Just terrible. Toughest crust ever and the toppings weren't even good. I'm just sad about the whole experience.",

    "text": "Having just moved here from NY, I was excited to see what kind of pizza places were around my apartment. After reading these reviews, Those Guys was an obvious front runner for being our local spot.   We went in today, and the guy that helped was helpful, funny, and really laid back. He made us a half regular and half white pie, because he overheard my girlfriend and I debating which to get.   When he was packing it up to give it to us, he said something to the effect of \"if you don't like that pie, you're crazy!\" .... But he's such a laid back guy that it came off more of quiet confidence and being friendly. Man though, he was right.   They slather on garlic, which I happen to love. If you don't, perhaps this won't be the place for you.   The regular pie was delicious, the sauce and cheese they use are SO flavorful. The crust was a bit soggy (we drove 10 minutes home), but man the flavor was so good I easily forgave some sogginess.   The white pie was also really good, and had some great pockets of garlic.   Needless to say, my girlfriend and I can't talk to anyone without eating ten pieces of gum, but man was it worth it! Great service, great pizza, great price!",

So my husband and I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.. I don't know what these other people are talking about, the fries were probably the best part. My husband ordered the Italian Philly and I ordered a plain cheese steak, they were the most bland sandwiches I've EVER had. $30 for 2 sandwiches and an order of fries, I couldn't even force myself to finish HALF of my sandwich! We literally threw almost all of it away. Bread was soggy and even the Meat was soggy and flavorless!!! Next time I'll just take the extra few min car ride and go to Capriottis. Don't waste your time.",

I can imagine not giving 5 stars for ambiance etc if you're dining-in, because this place is a bit of a hard find & it seems as tho you should take your loot and be on your way, why you wanna hang around anyway? Got no friends? Love watching the Guy Fieri loop in their tv? The pizza was a bit pricey $39 for 2 regulars, but here's the thing, I like everyone worse have been lulled into buying the Papa Johns crap where it's always a $25 BOGO deal or some other marketing that gets me to buy their stuff. Those Guys Pies on the other hand, was WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!!  The crust was good, sauce was phenomenal & the ingredients were tasty and fresh. We got the white pie with mushrooms & the Greek pizza. We're not vegetarians, but we don't like meat on our pies. The 14 inch Regulars were HUGE too! Vegas has no shortage of amazing food/ restaurants & I'd put this near the top!",

But I didn't realize it was in Summerlin so it was too far for them to deliver or even for postmates to deliver it :(  I still wanted to try it so a week later my boyfriend and I decided to drive out there for dinner. We get there and again didn't realize it's not really a \"sit down\" type place (should have looked this up beforehand). We still ordered and decided to take it home, but it just stinks that were about a 20 min drive back home.   We were so hungry and excited we ordered a lottttt! We got the works sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich, three cheese fries, pepperoni pizza, and lastly the cinnamon poppers. Talk about eyes being bigger than our stomachs lol.   The pizza was really good, my boyfriend was obsessed! It was a little cold because of our drive home but still awesome. I can't wait to try one of their specialty pizzas next time! The buffalo chicken sandwich was definitely good, but a little dry- there wasn't much sauce. The works was probably the BEST Philly cheese steak I've ever had in my life. The three cheese fries were also good, but definitely don't recommend getting them if you have a long drive home... They were a bit soggy and cold by the time we got home. And the cinnamon poppers I couldn't even tell you if they were good because they forgot to give us the cream cheese dipping sauce :( but I'm sure with the sauce they are delicious. So maybe next time!  All in all, I would say our drive was worth it. I'm only giving it 4 stars because our wait was a bit longer than we expected and they forgot our dipping sauce. I can't blame the cold food on them because they can't help we live farther away. But I definitely wouldn't be mad if they opened a closer location ;)",

Huge sliced sausage pieces, creamy ricotta, mozzarella and lots of garlic! These slices are thin, and incredible.  We also ordered a cheese steak sandwich. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and order one too! Soft roll, perfectly seasoned steak, peppers, onions, mushrooms and hot melted cheese!  Thank you Yelp! We checked in and received free Cinnamon bites. We really enjoyed them. Also included was a lemony cream cheese dip. So good!  My only negative, and it's a small one, is that the dining room is not big at all. There are only three tables, two tables seats two people and one table seats five. Since we drove from the other side of town, we sat and ate and enjoyed our trip. We highly recommend Those Guys Pies!",

We ordered the Big Sexy and a chicken fingers cheesesteak.  The Big Sexy was amazing! The crust was cooked to perfection with what I call \"hang time\".  When I  pick up the slice and the tip of it hangs over my fingers and I look for the oil (or grease) to drip off just a bit...that's hang-time.  The cheesesteak was good, not amazing.

Take-out is the best option. The seating area can fit about 8 people comfortably. After that, forget it. It seems clean on the inside but the place could definitely use a little TLC.   The Italian White Pie was just okay for me. I think next time I would prefer the Regular White Pie much better. The broccoli rabe and caramelized onions brought on a taste that was more than what I was looking for. The meat lovers was good. There was an abundant amount of toppings on each pizza, which I very much appreciate.  The chicken wings though! So good. Hot and fresh, just like they should be. The wings are cooked to a golden brown perfection and served with your choice of sauce. They were so juicy & tender it's almost ridiculous.  The cinnamon poppers were good too. I actually think the cream cheese dipping sauce was my favorite part. I do wish that the sauce was warm - however, still delicious. I heard the man in charge tell the cashier to stop taking free Yelp cinnamon poppers because he was going to lose $12-$15. I get it, business is business & you definitely have to make your money. But not exactly appropriate for your customers to hear.   I wanted to love this place, but I left with an average experience. I'll be back to take-out some chicken wings though!",

After entering the information, I was alerted that it would be \"approximately 25 minutes.\"  After fifteen minutes, I left home for the 10 minute drive to Those Guys Pies.  When I walked in, the gentleman asked if I was Norm.  When I said yes, he apologized and said it would be about 5 minutes longer.  At that time, I didn't realize the pie he was putting in the oven was mine.  I sat down and played Angry Birds for a while, checked my email, and did some Facebooking.  In about 10 minutes, he took the pie out of the oven, boxed it, and then sliced it, and brought it over to me.  When I got home, I had a pizza who crust was not done--soggy would be the best description.  Trying to separate a slice from the pie, the toppings just stayed behind as I pulled out the soggy crust and then used my fork to get some of the left behind toppings onto the slice.  I am not a pizza folder when I eat a slice but short of eating this by cutting the slice with a knife and eating it with a fork would be the only other way.  For tonight, I became a folder.  The baking time was simply insufficient and the results were obvious when I got home.  I would have rather had a longer wait than to have a pie that was very disappointing.  This was my second time at Those Guys Pies.  It was also my last!",

Even the three cheese fries were great!!  Run don't walk to this place. It beats anything in town.  Maybe hard to find if you do not know the area, and it is small. Service was great and they food was great for the price and quality of freshness.",

It's to the right of the lounge and dry cleaners.  On the left of Alaron.  Delicious aroma of food in the air as you walk in the door.  They've been on Diners, Dive-ins and Dives and they have the TV there of their episode on replay.  We went with \"The Works\" Philly cheesesteaks. Absolutely juicy, messy, and we should of dined in because by the time we drove home 10 min away the bun was soggy (mistakes on us).  I think next time we'll get regular cheesesteaks without the works as takeout.",

So, with that in mind, Those Guys gets a 3. The crust was nice and fluffy but I don't think it was made with good quality flour. Overall I'd say the ingredients were of an ok, but not particularly good quality. The boneless chicken tastes like your standard boneless chicken.  It's better than some other places around (Rosatis), so there is that. But I'd say overall it is a fairly 'average' place.",

    "text": "SO HAPPY my boyfriend found this place when we were in Vegas this past weekend. We read that this place was on Triple D with Guy Fieri, main reason we came here but I wasn't sure what to expect.   It's about a 20min away from the LV strip in a nice community store center that's right by this pretty lake!   The guy at the front was super friendly and you could see the guys in the back cooking up your food..which smelled amazing!   It was a little small inside so not best for big parties but they have tables and chairs you can eat at. We got ours to go & went to the lake near by and ate it at this park with a bench!   My boyfriend got the original philly cheesesteak with the cheese wiz & I got the meatball sandwich. I can HONESTLY say this place has THE BEST PHILLY CHEESESTEAK I've ever had!!! And I've had a lotttt. They give you so much meat that is tender and melts in your mouth, plus the onions, and can't forget the amazing cheese wiz!   The meatball sub I got was so yummy too but nothing like the cheesesteak I gotta say.. thankfully my boyfriend always shares and it was huuuge so we even had leftovers for later when we were drunk after the night on the town haha (we were stoked).  DEFINITELY GET THE CHEESESTEAK!! And thank me later! I'm dreaming of it right now....so yes, I WILL BE BACK when I'm in Vegas!",

Got home and the was all ready to dig in.  Looked absolutely amazing and smelled just as great.  Went to pick up a slice to put on my plate and it was soggy :( That made me sad.  Like very very sad.  I had to now wait longer as I had to put it in the oven because it was too soggy.  We don't live very far so idk maybe it comes that way but I personally don't like it.  After putting it in the oven, it tasted pretty good.  Probably would've gotten 4 stars if the crust was edible without tossing in the oven.",

We ordered a half Shroom and half Spicy Italian pie with a side of wings (with the Wasabi Ranch and Garlic Parm dipping sauces).  Due to the limited seating, he suggested that we sit by the lake, which had a great view.  Once we received our order, we dug right in.  The first bite was so yummy and full of gooey cheesy mushroom goodness.  The wings were nice and crispy.  We both enjoyed the Wasabi Ranch very much; the ranch actually made for an excellent dip for the pizza crust as well.  After we downed a bottle of Coke, we went back to the pizza place and thanked them for a great meal.  Also, I don't understand how a pizza this good can be made in 10 minutes.  Much lesser establishments take far longer, cost just as much and don't have that very NY east coast freshly made-gooey-oily flavor that Those Guys offer up.    **This review was written by my gf, who was raised on a steady diet of east coast pies growing up.",

I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza and the cheese fries. The guy on the phone was very nice and courteous, and told me it would take 35 minutes for delivery. Honestly it came before the 35 minutes, which made me really happy. And let me tell you, if one of my friends tried Those Guys and didn't like it, I would look at my friend differently from then on, secretly of course, but different nonetheless. I vow to never eat at another pizza place again! even if they give me a life time of pizza. Also can't deny Hottie McHotterson the delivery guy (too much? Sorry) I finished the pizza by myself by the next morning, and I'm ordering the same thing again two days later. Next time (probably in a few days) im going to try the white pizza. Ugh I'm in love. The prices are amazing too, you can get an amazing pizza that is made so well for the same price as a big chain. AND with sides and a 2 liter. Im about to cry....",

Definite give them a try!",

Every time, my order has been ready when promised and the people answering the phone and taking orders have been  very pleasant.   My family is a big fan of the chicken fingers.  We skip the sauce and just get extra fingers.    Today we tried the Italian White Pizza.  Lots of garlic and ricotta cheese.  A little pricey, but worth it.    Looking forward to trying the rest of their pizzas.    We found the cheesesteak to be too salty and not worth the price.  There are better cheesesteak options in Las Vegas and on the west side of town.  Overall... two thumbs up for Those Guys.  We will be back.",

    "text": "We were excited to try a new pizza place, even more so when we heard it was from the same guys at Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. Really wanted to like this place, but it was not meant to be. The mishaps started when we tried to call ahead for pickup. The first time we called it went to a voicemail box after several rings with no way to leave a message (not that we would anyway). We double checked that the number was correct and that they should be open. The same thing happened with the second call. I don't know what possessed us to try yet again, but the third time our call was answered. Not an auspicious start... What a great way to lose a lot of potential business from less tenacious, potential customers.  We ordered the Italian white pizza ($22) and a spinach salad ($7) and were told it would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived about 35 minutes later and was told my order was not quite ready yet. As I was paying for my order, I noticed that they were just putting my pizza into the oven. WTH? Really? I guess that's a new personal first... When we get pizza from anywhere else, we are told 20 minutes (sometimes 30 minutes if it's prime time on Fri night), and when we show up it is usually ready or occasionally comes out of the oven a couple minutes after arrival. Here, I proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for the pizza to be cooked and then another 5 minutes of so for them to construct the spinach salad. So basically, it took another 15 minutes after I arrived for my order to be ready for a total time of 50 minutes from when I called. It should go without saying that it shouldn't take 50 minutes to prepare your take-out pizza order. Even if that was acceptable, they shouldn't tell you 30 minutes, only for you to show up and wait significantly longer. It wasn't like they were busy. I was the only customer there until this other guy showed up to pick up his pizza which they just started to put in the oven as I was leaving. I guess I'm not the only one...  We were hoping that after all this, at least the food would be worth the wait. Not by a long shot... Although it smelled pretty good, the pizza crust was undercooked so we stuck it in the oven for another 5 minutes. Despite this, the pizza crust was quite soggy in the middle and pretty greasy throughout. The broccoli rabe topping was tough, and the homemade sausage was nothing special. My wife commented that she would rather have Dom DeMarco's pizza, and she doesn't even like their pizza! Of note, they included tiny containers of red pepper flakes, oregano, and parmesan which was a nice touch. The spinach salad was even more disappointing. It was lined with an anemic pita (not included in the salad description) and contained a relatively small amount of wilted, soggy spinach dressed with some bacon lardons, goat cheese, and candied almonds.  We'll be sticking with our tried and True, Rocco's Pizza, where the crust is cooked properly, it's not too greasy, the toppings taste better, it's ready in 20 minutes, and it even costs less ($18). Sorry, Those Guys Pies. I just tell it how it is, and you've got a long way to go.",

We decided to order our own pizza and take it home. I ordered half Maui Wowie (house made bacon, pineapple, pickled jalapenos) other half was The Big Sexy (sausage, pepperoni, bacon) a 14\" was $15.  When the pie was ready, they saw how excited I was to dig in, so they offered us half of a table so we could sit and enjoy the pizza hot. I really like the flavors of all the fresh ingredients. They make all their meat and mozzarella in house. Loved the pickled jalapenos. Traded a piece of Kevin's cheesesteak pie (that happens to be made with certified angus beef), this had great flavor.  The pizzas came with a side of crushed red pepper, onion salt, parmesan cheese, and oregano and a side of ranch. As we were injoying our pizza, we got to talking with Sean, one of the owners, and he filled us in on the background, clarifying that they are not affiliated with Secret Pizza. Also he said they have plans in the future to expand so they will have a dining area. As a departing gift, he had us try the maple mascarpone cheesecake, this was a perfect ending to dinner, this was delicious!",

They offered to remake it but I am not even able to get there my friend had picoed it up for me and i am not interested in ordering here ever again. They should disclose the fact that they chop off  2 inches of your sandwich.",

You can sit but it will have to be outside on the rinky dink table next to the Lake or a bench in front of another business.  I had the intentions (with Yelper Angela T)  to come in and sit down to try these new pies but there was no sit down option, there's a flat table to the right when you walk in but it was more for their business.  However, we met with the person running the joint, Sean B., and he offered us chairs to sit down and have a slice or two.  I immediately took a bite out of my pie because the toppings looked fresh and it tasted as it looked.    I ordered half a big sexy and half cheese steak pie, both great and had a kick to it.  The pie and box comes with small containers of additional condiments such as peppers, cheese, garlic.  The True test for me however is how it tastes in the morning, and Those Guys Pies passed.    The upside down cheesecake was delicious, I would definitely recommend picking up an order of those.  It's not too much, and it's not too small, for how sweet it is it fits fine on the container they use now.  Some reviews state the thin crust, I've had thinner but I like this place because of how stacked the good quality ingredients are on the pies.  Enjoy and save me a piece!",

I saw that the restaurant was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  I've never been to a restaurant that was featured on that show so we decided to try it.  It was a 20 minute drive from our hotel.  Let me tell you, and I am not exaggerating.....this was one of the best pizzas that I ever had.  We ordered a large pizza, one half was vegetarian for my wife, the other was the BBQ Maui Waui.  Just fantastic.  I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in the Las Vegas area and has a craving for pizza.  Also, I believe that it was the owner that was there.  Great guy....asked how my Xmas was.....just a gentleman.",

I like the  buffalo-garlic parm and spicy barbecue wings (or strips!) with bleu cheese or an Italian cheese steak, add mushrooms.  Staff is friendly, shop is messy and lacks ambiance but the cook throws his heart and soul into the food. The chicken strips are good sized, long and skinny and crispy- but all the sauces are off the chain! Buffalo garlic parm is the favorite, but spicy barbeque is tasty as well. Bleu cheese dressing is fresh made in-house with chunks of actual cheese.  That Italian Cheese Steak has plentiful rib eye, peppers, and onions, topped with high quality melted provolone and a good amount of mushrooms (for a minor surcharge). Bread is good and though a bit soggy, held up without falling apart.  This a regular pick-up stop during football season. The pizza is pretty solid, but as detailed above, I actually prefer their other menu offerings.",

They told us to go here for New York style pizza. And we were just like ok yeah right, we are hungry let's just get some pizza. We ordered on the phone and a few minutes later it was ready for pick up. Throughout the whole ride back to work I couldn't stop thinking if we made the right choice, I mean this pizza has ought to be good because we were feeding a lot of workers. And then the moment of truth came we opened the boxes and boom BAM! We were impressed, I liked the quality and taste of this pizza! Especially the diablo style pizza, it was the first time I could almost finish the entire regular box by myself. I will definitely come back, and I look forward too. And you know what's even better? The customer service. I forgot to request a receipt upon my arrival and I called back and asked if I could obtain a copy, very politely they managed to send me a copy to my email. There you go, great pizza + good customer service it's on my A list.",

Added an order of fries after asking if they were seasoned (which we didn't want) or just regular. Assured they were regular fries. We sat for almost a half hour waiting for our to go order. From where my Brother was sitting, he saw his sandwich sitting on a table and we were waiting for mine to get done. His sandwich sat for ten minutes and then mine was ready and it sat for awhile. We got home and the fries were covered in seasoning, the meat on my sandwich had a lot of fat in it. My Brothers has a bunch of wilted lettuce when he asked for light lettuce. I don't know if the same guy owns this place or someone else took over. We won't go back. It was a horrible experience. From what I could see, there were at least five guys working. There was no reason to wait half an hour for two sandwiches.",

I am sooo glad we chose this place!  It's located in the back corner if a strip mall in The Lakes.  I can only hope they expand and put another location closer to us, because this location is a little of a jaunt.  Believe me though, jaunt or no, we will be returning frequently!  If you want to sit and eat, there's a small table inside, or seats by the lake.  It's a beautiful view.    Don't judge the food from the outside.  It is a small pizzeria, but it's all good!  We were immediately greeted and welcomed.  The place smelled so good!  I immediately thought of our fave pizza place in NYC!  Scrammed, bustling and packed full of deliciousness!  We decided to carry out The Works and the Meatball subs.  I don't think I can properly describe how good these subs were.  Forget any other sub shop!  The flavors were off the chain....homemade meatballs, need I say more??  We will most definitely be back to try the pizzas.  The white pizza has been calling my name.  Those Guys Pies just made customers for life!!!!!  This place belongs on our FAVE Vegas eats list!",

    "text": "My company ordered some pizzas from Those Guys Pies after hearing about it through some friends.  The pizza was delivered on time and still hot which was a great start.  I love NY style thin crust pizza so I was excited to try this!  We had 3 different specialty pies delivered so there were some options to try.  We had the White Pie, Meat Pie, and the Maui Wowie.  All the slices I tried were delicious and flavorful.  I especially liked the White Pie with the ricotta and garlic on it.  They also included some red chili flakes, parmesan cheese, oregano, and garlic powder in small containers with was an excellent touch and made the pizza taste that much better.  I would definitely order from Those Guys Pies again and get a White Pie and maybe try something new.  Their chicken fingers look awesome with all the sauces they offer.    Thanks Those Guys Pies, you'll be hearing from me again soon!",

Not bad by any means. Wouldn't get it again though. We will be back for sure though. I can't wait to try all of there pies. I've already told friends and family they have to go there. I have lots of family and friends coming down for march madness. I'll will be getting pies from there and taking them to the strip for my family and friends to enjoy! Those guys is a must for sure!!

We always order the same pizza:  half mushroom for me, half pepperoni for him and we went with the regular size, which yields 8 slices.  There were no other customers in the 20 minutes or so that we were there around 8:00pm, but the service was friendly.  It's basically a store-front operation in the same Lakes plaza that houses the King & I Thai and Go Raw Cafe.  I don't know if it was because it was Sunday or what, but it was deserted at the whole place.  Regardless, the 10 minute drive home was difficult with the aroma of the pizza and two starving people in the same car.  The pizza itself was fine; my son and I agreed it was too greasy for our tastes.  Some people like that, but we don't.  Good crust, though.  In the end, I still like Grimaldi's and Dom De Marco's more.",

I ordered an original cheesesteak with whiz \"with (which means with onions) and mushrooms and peppers,a caprese salad and a mascarpone cheesecake.  The salad was delicious, huge pieces of mozzarella, beautiful heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil.  So fresh, so delicious.  olive oil, balsamic vinegar....so delicious.  The cheesesteak was so juicy, so tasty, delicious.  Then the cheesecake, while WAY TOO small, was delicious.  Very impressed.  Only thing is the $27 price tag but then it was a big salad and delicious.  Worth it.  And They deliver which Roccos does not which is why I chose them.",

However, the last 2 times we ordered, the food was lousy! All we can think of is it must be under new ownership now? Something is wrong, it's definitely not like it once was. The food quality has gone downhill. Today, my husband dropped over $60 on a meal for the family. Both pizzas sucked, very disappointing! Underneath the crust was caked with flour, it had dried out crust and barely any sauce, and both pizza tops were way overcooked, they were burnt! No one could even eat it. We also ordered 2 philly cheesesteaks, another total disappointment! There was hardly any meat and toppings like it used to be. And finally, the girl working the register had a rotten attitide. It was once a pleasure to run in and get our order. Must be under new ownership? Definitely not the same.  We have purchased our last meal from Those Guys, which was previously a family favorite. We will not be returning following 2 disappointments in a row.",

The Diablo would have been amazing if they hadnt drenched it in that sweet chili sauce on top, there was just way way too much on it, it was all that was tasted, it was like eating candied pizza... Ick! The Big Sexy.. well it was actually just weird.  have had a similar pizza (same toppings) from another place and liked it, but TGP they put their onions on in HUGE slices, it was all that could be tasted. It wasnt as bad as the Diablo, but It wasnt amazing either. I will probably be passing on their pizza in the future.  The second time I ordered I got Chicken fingers, and 3 cheese fries.. The fries were AMAZING, I mean the cheese was hardish when it got here as it cooled, but they are still great, especially with ranch (not theirs) drizzled all over them mmm. The Chicken Fingers were just nasty. They were big which is nice, but super salty. I mean overly salty, the breading was weird, I LOVE chicken fingers and this is the first time Ive ever passed on them. Their ranch is just weird tasting, its like... they mixed Mayo and Ranch together, luckily I had some in the fridge for the fries.   I dont think I will be giving this place another shot. To bad I really wanted to like them :/",

The chicken fingers were fine, and the sauces were interesting (if not necessarily good... maple mustard wasn't a winner)  It was fine overall, but we probably won't order from here again.",

    "text": "Not happy after waiting the 40mims for a pizza that i did not order arrives. I spoke with the man and stated i wanted mozzarella cheese, spinach, and tomatoes he then asked if i wanted to add basil i said yes and i wanted to add hot wings i got a pizza with no spinach n it tasted like a can of tomato sauce n the wings were dry and salty. i had to apply my own sauce and of course they only gave a small container. First time and last time ordering from here. I thought with all the reviews being positive it may be a one shooter but im not willing to spend another $27 for pizza n wings that taste nasty. Oh n i gv them to a homeless person maybe he'll enjoy it",

    "text": "Overpriced and overrated.   I've been looking forward to trying Those Guys because of all these good reviews. I had a \"buy 1, get 1\" coupon so I figured that was a bonus!   The shop is small and hidden and the employees were friendly enough, but the pizza did not live up to the 4 stars it gets here on yelp. We ordered 2 pies: the \"Shroom\" and the \"Spicy Red Italian\". They were ready in about 20 minutes.  I always make sure I try a slice before I get home because a 15-20 minute drive can do terrible things to a pizza and I want an honest \"out of the oven\" opinion. We found a spot outside and opened the boxes only to find two very wet looking pies. I tried picking up a slice and it was so limp I basically ended up with a handful of toppings and grease. I had to fold it in half and even then, the tip had to be folded up into the middle of the slice. I ended up sucking out the ingredients like pizza soup.  Taste-wise, it wasn't too bad and the ingredients seemed fresh but the crust could not stand up to them. It was a very messy situation. If I hadn't had the 2 for 1 coupon I would have been really upset as those two pies would have run me about $45. Seriously? I've worked in a pizza shop before so I know pizza doesn't have to cost that much.  I seem to be in the minority here but I definitely won't be rushing back to Those Guys any time soon. There are much better options out there.",

I ordered the works cheesesteak w/Whiz and an order of chicken fingers with Wasabi Ranch and the Siraicha sauce (don't think I spelled correct sorry). The cheesesteak was $12 and the fingers were $8. Neither came with fries, a bit disappointing. The chicken fingers are definitely hand cut and breaded and are more like 8 regular size fingers elsewhere. The sauce options are unique and were good. The cheesesteak was definitely better than most but seemed a bit shy on the wiz and the shrooms.",

Another plus is the pizza was cooked properly, bottom brown.  Super important to have properly cooked pizza, excellent ingredients and a nice crust.  The cheese steaks were both very good meat.  You can tell it was real ribeye.  The only problem I had was the bread.  Way to soft.  No crunch to it.  If the bread had been better my rating would of been higher.  Would I order this pizza again.  Yes but I wouldn't travel out of the way for it.  I wouldn't order the cheessteak again unless they got a better bread ,  a nice French bread would be alot better. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  Most Vegas people won't know the difference but if you really want to stand out get better bread.",

But no worries, our scrumptious BBQ chicken with sweet onion pizza was made within 10 minutes.   We got it to go because it was rather hot inside with the large ovens.    We found a nice little park nearby and enjoyed our pizza immensely.    There were many selections in the menu.  Pizza, sandwiches, salads and appetizers.

If you look at my record I only have 7 five stars against my 100 and whatever so... that means quite a bit of awesome happened this day. I think the best part was meeting the 75 year old chain smoker while we waited for our pizza but... I digress.   BBQ Chicken... delicious. One of my favorite BBQ pizzas ever... which I guess doesn't tell the whole story. They use a great BBQ sauce that mixes well with the chicken and cheese and yum.  The garlic chicken - I think... I dont remember haha. But what i do know is that there was ricotta cheese on them which is a freakin must and a half. (what does must and a half mean... no one knows.) But it was so good i loved the garlic mixed with mozzarella.  The Cheese sticks... great I would suggest getting some with your order (total price ended up around 40). I am writing this review while hungry and I am just craving this pizza. It is the perfect comfort food. And the perfect make you fat food. Thats how you know its good.  THE VERDICT: best pizza place in vegas. I dont know i only went to one... but a who gives a damn... yes it is the best. It is out of the way but it will be the perfect drunk snack for you, and the perfect hangover snack in the morning for you and your significant other... or insignificant other in the room with you. Long live those guys!",

The Philly cheesesteak pizza and plain cheese and white pizza are my favs. Oh and what's in their ranch???? I want gallons of it! Trust me. Try it. You'll be raving about it. You'll be driving across town for it. You'll be telling all your friends about it. The staff is awesome and super friendly and the delivery drivers rock and are super chill. Those Guys Pies!

    "text": "Items Selected: Cheese Pizza with Artichokes / Italian White Pie with Ricotta, Mozarella, Sausage, Broccoli Rabe, Caramelized Onion Fried Mushrooms Meatball Cannolis Cinnamon Poppers with Citrus Cream Cheese Dipping Sauce  Located at The Lakes and described as \"a labor of love to create the best for the best,\" Those Guys Pies had long been a member of the Las Vegas 'to-do' list and with business nearby on Friday afternoon a visit was planned the day prior, online ordering allowing pickup orders to be placed in advance with an 11:20am default setting.  Cited by trusted sources as \"good pizza in an inconvenient spot,\" the latter lament an accurate description for pretty much anything at The Lakes, Those Guys Pies is tucked away in a small shopping center on Lake East Drive and with minimal signage plus limited seating the restaurant operates mostly as a grab-n'-go option for local residents, the \"wait times approximate\" as was demonstrated by an 11:40am order readied just four minutes before noon.  Visited by Guy Fieri for Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, this fact obvious as Chef Roy Bass plays the DVD on a television in-house, Those Guys Pies looks to set itself apart from other pizzerias by focusing on quality products and a philosophy of doing as much as possible within the small kitchen, roots in Jersey and reference to Tacconelli's giving those familiar hopes that may be a bit over-inflated, though the Philadelphia icon is certainly not a bad target at which to aim.  Running just a three man crew, the wait times not conducive to those with only an hour for lunch, it was at a small table alongside the man-made lake that lunch was enjoyed and although the oft-praised Maple Cheesecake was sold out the $28 tab nonetheless netted more than enough food to share, the half-and-half options for pies as well as sides allowing for a good amount of variety beginning with tender breaded mushrooms and a handmade Angus Meatball that featured almost no filler beneath mozzarella and bright marinara, the richness mellowed slightly by notes of garlic, basil and rosemary.  Watching the pizza get loaded into the oven at the time of my 11:39 arrival, the fourteen minute cook-time certainly not enough to render edges crispy as I stood, ignored, at the counter waiting, first bites of the red sauce slice showed good flavor but compromised crust texture and moving on to the \"Italian White Pie\" Special the results were equally mixed as the toppings were absolutely top-grade amidst pools of ricotta while the crust was starchy and flimsy with too much stretch.  Turning to desserts, the Fried Dough with Cinnamon, Sugar and a sidecar of sweet topping complimentary with Social Media Check-In, Those Guys Pies apparently brings the cheesecakes in from an outside source who makes these only for them and with the daily delivery not yet arriving tastes were instead invested in freshly made cannoli with a sturdy shell that shatters into creamy mascarpone dotted with chocolate chips, not as good as those at Naked City or Elements, but a heck of a lot better than the prefilled disasters people wait in line for at Carlo's Bakery.  ***While the issues noted make me question the \"Good pizza\" portion of the \"inconvenient spot\" quote there is no doubt Those Guys are working with good product, the desserts and appetizers all excellent even before considering the bargain pricing compared to local competitors.",

It's not greasy and the sauce to bread ratio is great so the crust doesn't get soggy at all which is awesome. Definitely recommend very good. We ordered for delivery, they were here in maybe 15-20mins which is great time, and it was nice and hot, the delivery guy was too. Lol, no, but he was very nice. Very good place, reasonable prices for the quality you're getting. Definitely will be ordering from here again.",

I lived in Philly for 6 years, I love cheesesteaks and thought the drive would be worth this one since it looked so amazing on the episode.  The place is very small only 2 tables with 6 chairs each.  One table was taken when I got there so the space was very limited to even sit at the other table.  All that being said they have a great selection and can really put out food as a majority of the place is kitchen.  The pizzas looked great and the people eating there said it was awesome.  This probably would have been definitely 4 stars if not 5 but unfortunately the guy who took my order and made my steak, I specifically asked for no mushrooms and he put mushrooms on the sandwich which I did not know until I got home.  So unfortunately I cannot write a review on the food as I could not eat this sandwich.  Sad people charge you $12 for anything and cannot pay attention to allergy requests or make something the way you ordered it.  It's also sad to drive all the way across town just to throw the food you paid for in the trash.  The guy even repeated my order, NO MUSHROOMS but still put them on the sandwich.  Very disappointed..",

They serve the wings plain and give you the sauces to season yourself. My favorite flavors were the pineapple buffalo and wasabi ranch. The fried mushrooms had a nice batter and were cooked well. They even stayed crispy after a long drive home. I was excited about the cheesesteak after hearing all the raves and I was a little disappointed. It was so greasy and was bland.  The wings were enough to draw me back and I look forward to trying their pizza on my next visit. The guys at Those Guys Pies were great and very accommodating.",

We ordered a large pepperoni, bell pepper and mushroom pizza, chicken fingers and fried mushrooms. When the delivery person arrived with the pizza bag, the pizza box was bending on both sides and the two bags were weighed on top smashing the pizza. I had to help her take the box out as she was pulling the box slanted almost upright. The fried mushrooms were smashed into a closed plastic box and two sauce containers were literally pushed down onto the mushrooms. It wasn't edible to say the least. We are disappointed at the $49.00 spent here. The two stars are for the friendly customer service over the phone.  Pizza was ordered on Saturday, April 30th, in the evening.",

This is a small restaurant with two 6 tops in it. When I was here there were 5 people and we had to share a table. No big deal to me, especially when the food is good.   Cheesesteak - Wow. It was great. You can see the picture.   Pizza - Fantastic. You can see the picture of it too.  I've been looking for a new pizza place for quite some time. Too bad this place is so far from my house.  Service was great and friendly. With the check-in on Yelp I was given a free cinnamon popper desert.   I definitely recommend this place just like Guy.",

Delivery was quick, we received our delivery in approximately 45 minutes! The Cheesesteak was the best I have had in 7 years living in Vegas for sure and possibly ever! I'll definitely be ordering again! I have looked all over for a White Garlic Pizza like this since leaving my favorite in Arizona years ago. This after too many failed attempts FINALLY hit the spot! If we had not had pizza The night before I probably would've gotten more pies but I will definitely be re-ordering so it will not be a problem",

    "text": "This is the BEST non NYC style pizza place in Las Vegas! This place is like a 20+ mile drive from my house and I still go there often. Their pizza and chicken tenders are just divine!  The pizza I always go with is the Diablo pizza. It's got a ghost pepper sauce as the base, banana peppers, jalapenos, pepperoncinis, and sweet chili as toppings. It's really not that spicy, but I suppose that's not saying much as I order my Thai food at an 8 for mild spice. Either way, if you're a spicy food fanatic you need this in your life.   The chicken tenders are HUGE, panko breaded, and fried fresh to order. It takes a few extra minutes when picking it up but it's so worth it! The chicken is piping hot and juicy. They have creative dipping sauces such as pineapple buffalo and Thai peanut.   The customer service is flipping fantastic. There used to be an option to order all the chicken dipping sauces as \"extra hot\" and apparently they did away with it. When my fiance called and requested it they said they no longer offered their old extra hot option but could put an off the menu hot sauce in our dipping sauces to spice it up more. They could have simply told us it wasn't on the menu anymore, but they went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Major brownie points.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, truly these guys know their way around a kitchen. It's off the beaten path but I can assure you it'll be worth it.",

Well I recommend them? Yes and No,sorry ! Only reason for my answer is cause of the few things I saw while eating my pizza I hope management gets to read this and decides to maybe give it a lil makeover it may not hurt them,new tables maybe? A new painting? A floor cleaning? Enjoy your pizza ladies and gentlemen!!!",

Hubby actually ordered a \"Original Cheesesteak\" with cheese whiz, onions and peppers, but I ended up eating almost half of it. I just loved the flavor and enjoyed every bite! The sandwich was 10 inches long and stuffed with thinly shaved beef. We shared a order of \"Mozzarella Sticks\" priced at $7 and they were cheesy. Each one had their own unique shape as they are hand breaded to order. Be prepared for lots and lots of oozing cheese with these! I do wish the breading had more flavor, but they are totally worth ordering. I ordered a \"Italian White Pie\" priced at $16.50 and it was 14 inches. The pizza had mozzarella, ricotta, sausage, broccoli rabe, garlic and caramelized onions. I liked the pizza, but it actually tasted much better re-heated the next day for lunch. The guy who took our order and gave us our food was nice. I'd like to come back and try some of their other pizzas, sandwiches, salads and of course I will be back for more cheesesteak!   Delivery is offered. Check the website to see if you are in the delivery area. They have different lunch specials daily.",

It could have saved us a lot of trouble of ordering so-so pizza for all this time.   To start, the gentleman that I ordered from on the phone was incredibly nice and helpful.   We ordered two pizzas for delivery. One \"Big Sexy\" and one custom made vegetarian pizza. They were both very very good. The vegetarian had their roasted tomatoes and they were the highlight of it all. They were still crisp and juicy but also full of flavor. The gentleman on the phone explained how they are marinated before roasting. It really was a delight on our pizza. Thin, bendable, pizza with a bubbly and crunchy crust. I am sure when we order delivery to the house we will be ordering here from now.   As always, I like supporting the local joints close to our area.",

Amazing!  Chef Roy has nailed it. Try anything on the menu, so good. Even the salads are great. I see why 3ds did a segment on them. Roy hits a homerun with his menu.  Definitely a favorite! Friday nights a Greek pizza and a good bottle of wine. I love this restaurant!",

    "text": "Our daughter mentioned this place to us as her and husband frequent the strip mentioned the Cosmo connection etc etc. After phoning in the order, drove 5 minutes for pick-up. (It's a pick-up/delivery kinda place.) Super nice guy working, very pleasant. The storefront was very clean and our order was ready as promised. The counter guy said business was picking up, which is good for such an out of the way place.  We ordered the 'Big Sexy' pizza the cheesesteak with extra onions and the cinnamon poppers (spelled that way on the menu). I'll keep this short; the cheesesteak was super dry and hardly an onion was to be found and the roll was a couple of days old. The pizza was 'ok' the edge of the crust was good but the rest was greasy and soggy....way too thin is the problem. The sauce and meatball slices were good. The poppers were ok for 5 bucks, kinda tough but ok. I make zeppoli at home and thought these would be just as tender. Not.   For the money I'll stick to Rocco's or Metro as for the cheese steaks I'll drive cross town to Geri's or around the corner to Cappriotti's. I'm from South Philly which means nothing. Hey I'm not a chef but I know good food when I taste it. BTW I think charging $0.75 for a few pepperoncini's on the side is tacky  Bottom line, the service was really good and the food....Meh.",

    "text": "Very delicious!!!  I was referred by my new marketing company and since my staff and I are pizza lovers and have a particular taste bud for authentic pizza!  Those Guys Pies was fantastic.  I had called in for delivery to my office my staff being supper excited for lunch we ordered a cheese pizza, fingers and cheese steak.  I had to pick up the order because my office is just outside the 5 mile mark (I am 5.2 miles out) but I said to try a new pizza location is well worth a drive and the guy on the phone seemed exceptionally nice and apologetic.    When I got to the location it was easy to find the staff was very friendly I like being called by my name, telling me have nice day NAME. Just don't get that enough out here in Vegas.   Now the details of the delicious food!!!   The Cheese Steak has to be my favorite it was delicious, perfect amount of cheese and the steak OMG melted with so much flavor not chewy leather that I find everywhere else in this city.  The chicken fingers are my brothers fav in the city, fresh different and tasty he said and he would be the expert in this department lol.    The pizza reminded me of the east coast flavor which I miss being from Boston.  The spices, cheese and sauce all such a tasty combination and the dough was perfect thickness for my liking, hand tossed always the way to go if you like the mom and pop feel and fresh maid daily taste.    Overall I rate a 5 out of 5 because the service was exceptional, food was hands down tasty and enjoyed every bite.  I will order from here again I can not wait to try out other menu items.  Thanks!!",

The service was great, I was greeted immediately and the cashier was very polite. Everything went downhill when I got my pizza.  The place itself is very small with only 2 tables, so there's not much room to sit and eat. I ordered the meat pie and it took about 15 minutes. I was so excited to eat it since I was starving so I just found a table and decided to try a slice before leaving. I picked it up and it was pouring oil onto my paper plate that I could see through it. Immediately after that, all the toppings literally slid off the pizza and fell onto my plate so I'm just holding the crust at this point. Did they dump the whole jug of oil onto my pizza or something? I sort of lost my appetite at this point. I tried to take some napkins to dab the oil off and try to salvage what was left. I ended up eating whatever plopped onto my plate and gave the rest to someone else. Sadly, I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "This is the best cheesesteak in vegas.  I'm from the philadelphia area, so I'll break it down for all my fellow cheesesteak experts on what their cheesesteak is like:  Cheese- choice of whiz, provolone, or white american. I ordered whiz, it was mixed into the meat, not poured on top, making an equal cheese-meat ratio  Meat- good quality angus beef. Cooked perfectly, but not crusty. Finely chopped, not served in a big hunk like at Geno's. On the juicy rather than greasy side.   Onions- sliced thinly, not diced. These are probably the thinnest sliced onions I've had on a cheesesteak.  Roll- the roll was, hands down, the best part. Perfectly soft and crusty. A+++++++ for the roll. No sesame seeds on the roll.  They have a number of options for cheesesteaks, such as hoagie style (with lettuce and tomato),  pizza steak (marinara sauce) and an italian steak with provolone and broccoli rabe (a la tony luke's, they have a similar sandwich there).  Also, they NEVER refer to a cheesesteak as a Philly.  I can't wait to try the pizza. but the cheesesteak was totally baller.",

I travel 25 minutes away to grab this delicious pizza. I think the white pizza is da bomb!  The wings are pretty good.  They have great unique sauces for everyone's taste buds. The chicken fingers are really good too. If you like fresh chicken fingers these are great!  I really like Canes, but I think TGP have two stars ahead of them.    Now let's talk about the cheesesteak.  Yep these guys serve cheese steaks.  First of all I am not a cheesteak fan.  I was told every time I went to grab a pie to try the cheesesteak.  OMG....they made me a believer.  Get the cheesesteak and a PIE and you are good to go!    Those Guys Pies are in my humble opinion the BEST in knowing how to combine sauces, fresh high grade cheese and toppings, and the bombiest crust known to man into what most call pizza.....and for those you know pizza.......call pie!!!!    7  stars if yelp would let me....",

We ordered the meat pie and when I told the manager (?) that I lived in Henderson (about a 20-25 min drive), he told the pizza makers to only cook the pizza until it was 90% done and box it for me.  He told me that when I get home to put it in the oven for another 5-8 minutes and it would be done.  That is exactly what I did and the pizza was delicious!!  I appreciated the manager accommodating us that way...very nice!!!  We waited outside by the lake and watched the sun set as the pizza was being prepared.  There is not a lot of seating so I would suggest ordering your pizza or meal to go.  I think they said that they were moving to a larger place.  We will be back to try some other items on their menu when we are in the area.",
