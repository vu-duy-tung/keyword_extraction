    "text": "If you are vegan and enjoy eating vegan tacos, then you would certainly enjoy eating at Panchos Vegan tacos.  Panchos Vegan Tacos is located on the East side of Las Vegas inside the Tropicana Plaza. This taco joint does not only have tacos, but it has a variety of mexican food such as sopes, nachos, burritos etc; and they're all vegan. Panchos is a vegan restaurant that just opened up in the middle of 2017 and has been getting more popular as the population of vegan/ vegetarians has been growing overall too.     Having vegan family members can make eating out hard to do, because there is not a lot of vegan options in Las Vegas. I have come across a bunch of vegan places which have only been burger joints. I am vegetarian so my options of eating out is not as difficult as it is for my mother.  There is currently only one Panchos Vegan Tacos in Las Vegas as it a little brand new. Panchos Vegan Tacos is like a Robertos but everything on their menus is all vegan. Their tacos are filled with vegan ground meat and topped with cilantro, pico de gallo, and green spicy salsa. Their sopes are also topped off with vegan meat, chopped lettuce and tomatoes and a vegan cream.      I came across this place on Mother's Day. On a special day like this I did not want to take my mother to eat at the same burger joint she always goes to. So when we came across Panchos Vegan Tacos we thought it would be gross because the menus online did not look satisfying and the photos that were posted did not look as great either. When arriving, the restaurant was packed, and the place looked very unorganized, they used one whole section of the restaurant for the employees and guest to order their food, and the other half of the restaurant had about 8 booths and 4 tables. This restaurant does feel crowded because you have the line of guests ordering and then the other half of the line is outside or in the dining room area.   Although I had a first bad impression of this place, the employee greeted us and we told her that we were new to this place. Once we informed her of being new she explained the entire menu to us making things easier for us to explore the menu. Their food certainly surprised me and I was very surprised on how similar the street tacos from Panchos Vegan Tacos tasted like real street tacos.  My mother certainly enjoyed coming here as she told me how great the street tacos were too and how the sopes tasted just like the sopes she makes at home. This place does not only bring you great quality of food but it can also bring you back to home, because the foods have similar tastings to the original dishes.  The pricing for each plate is very affordable and the highest I have seen on the menu was about ten dollars, and that was for a huge burrito. Eating out at a vegan restaurant can turn out to be very expensive because there is not a lot to begin with, making prices higher since it is a unique thing to have in the city . So far this place is great and affordable and you can take someone out to eat here for just about any event. One thing that I loved about this restaurant is how pet friendly they are. I know that some people are not comfortable with having pets in the space that they are eating at, but this place surprised me because not only did the employees not mind but the guest at that time eating there did not mind also. This explains how good the environment here is and the atmosphere.Another thing I loved was the great service they provide, the employees did not mind taking the time to explain the entire menu to us and tell us how their dishes were done, I believe that's what helped us pick our dish because it gave us details of what we were going to be expecting. I recommend anyone who loves street tacos and mexican food overall to come visit Panchos Vegan Tacos.  I was satisfied with this place and have already told others to come here and have received great feedback. A couple of feedbacks I have received were from people who were not vegan/ vegetarian and have told me that the food that they tried tasted better than a taco with real meat. I have also received feedback from someone who was encouraged to stop eating meat because it made her realize that she can still eat her favorite foods with no meats. I have received a lot of positive feedback about the dishes and feedback about encouraging some people to try out the vegan/ vegetarian lifestyle. I think it is amazing that a simple review like minds can change another person's mindset in the up most positive ways. My intentions of sharing this place with others was not to encourage others to go vegan but to tell those who are vegan/ vegetarian to try this mexican joint out.",

Unfortunately, I won't return soon because I'm visiting from L.A., I wish we had a location like this in our city because our only Mexican options are overpriced and non-authentic. I can't believe they have sopa de fideo here, and sopes! This is exactly how vegan Mexican food should be, affordable and simply good.",

    "text": "Food is good, but I do have some trouble with the tamale combo. It's $9.99 for one tamale and beans and rice that's it altho the menu says smothered in sour cream and cheese and lettuce the lady there told me they never do that and it was a typo so ok that's cool but still it's $1.99 for one tamale on the side and she said it's like $1 for side of rice and side of beans so you're looking at $4 to get them as sides versus ordering the combo, she understood and offered another tamale which would be $6 so still would've been nice to get a drink there..  With that being said it's still good food, the cheese and jalepeno tamale is good the tacos are ok, and the wet burrito with red sauce was good too, their just needs to be better communication as the order was messed up and also their was a lack of customer service, she didn't seem happy just bleh about everything which I've met people like that so it may just be how she is. And also they need to fix the menu asap because that tamale special is not right, not at all. This was the second time I ordered the combo, first time I thought ooookkkkk but I didn't wanna say anything because I had two crazy kids and I didn't wanna seem like a bad person since it was my first time. But second time a week later and same thing and I didn't have my kids so I needed to say something.. anyways just wanted to give others a heads up!   I prefer taco y taco veggie burrito if you like veggies, they just have raw onions and pico and lettuce here no real veggies",

I ordered the beyond burger combo with guacamole and jalapenos, what I got was cold food. Some of the fries were blanched, but not fried. The lettuce tasted like it went bad. I had to scrape that extra stuff off and reheat and put it in bread I had here. When I called to complain, the lady implied grub hub wouldn't take care of it to dissuade me from calling them. When I told her about my cold food, she was like well we can't predict what happens during transit, then why was the soup I ordered warm? That's weird. It seems like my main meal was sitting around getting cold... but she was cool to refund me the 1.50 for the extras and the drink I never got. What kind of bs is that? I didn't ask for a refund on the other stuff I got because it was fine, but that attitude and lack of customer service is annoying. Admit that you made a mistake rectify it and move on.  *Grubhub was able  to get me the refund the restaurant didn't want to do",

If you modify your order at all make sure you double check because they commonly mess up modifications. I always order either no sour cream or order it on the side and maybe 30% of the time it's still on top. Management and owner are very helpful though and will make it right if there are any issues.   When ordering delivery through a 3rd party (Postmates, Uber Eats, Amazon) each service lists the menu items differently, and there are a few minor price discrepancies between them as well. I'd recommend they review their menus on each am make them consistent, especially when it comes to listing items such as fillings properly.  Creating some promo codes for these apps would be useful as well.  Overall good food and kind staff. So glad for a vegan Mexican restaurant!",

The fideo was really nice with some Tapatio in there.  Like a couple people mentioned... This place has some menu issues. It's only been open for about a month though.

You choose what type of \"meat relapcement\" you want for each, I got one of each that they had to offer and they were all delicious. Everything is seasoned well, including the rice and beans and I like spicy so their salsa satisfied me! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and it's no fault of the restaurant, there's not enough seating on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch. We had to wait for people to leave so we could sit, so just be expecting that if you go during a peak time. I'll definitely be back.",

I love, love, love their quesadillas and tacos.  The employees are always super nice and accommodating too. Great spot overall!",

It looked really sad I wish I took a picture of it but was so hungry! Wasn't bad just not as good as it usually consistently is! And the phones didn't work when i tried calling them?? Wonder why? But service was friendly!!",

My first time there was a long line but wasn't bothered because it gave me time to look at the entire menu. The girl looked new as well since she was lost but that's fine as well. When we got to order I decided on green enchiladas with adobada vegan meat. It was good but not amazing enough for me to come back.   This latest time I was advised to order the asada tacos and I did. The woman at the register was different and we received fast, great service. The sever was also extremely nice and even the food came I prepared it and wow, AMAZING FLAVOR. The tacos were so good and balanced enough with all the toppings (onion, cilantro, lime, radishes). I love the red salsa but the green salsa is also great. Meat eaters will also find this good because it tastes similar to actual meat, my friend was confused. Overall after the tacos I will definitely come back to eat more tacos thank you.",

    "text": "FOOD: All Vegan, all Mexican, all the time! They make their sauces (including a sour cream and fresh salsas) in house. The potato taquitos dorados are a good option for Vegan newbies, or their tacos. The \"asada\" is pretty good, will be trying the \"al pastor\" next. I was hoping to get a great grilled veggie burrito or even some veggie fajitas, but they don't seem to do that, which I found strange. I was thrilled to see quesadillas and nachos on the menu, but my \"asada\" quesadilla barely had anything in it. Vegan cheese can be a difficult transition though. Avocado was fresh but I'm perplexed as to why they only seem to have chopped iceberg lettuce and underripe tomatoes when their target audience is people who eat produce for half of their diet. Menu is extensive though, with other options including tamales, tortas, fideo soup, and sopes.  SERVICE: Not impressed with the female cashier. It's not obvious that you walk up to the bar to order since the register is smack-dab in the middle of the bar with chairs around it and tables blocking any reasonable area where patrons would line up. There's no signage and the menus are all over the tables, but there is no table service. Finally figured it out on my own since no one addressed me after I entered and stood around for a few minutes. Placed my order and the cashier had to double check with the kitchen for availability of every item, then asks multiple times if it's for here or to-go, making it an unnecessarily long process. No smiles, no friendliness, nothing that indicates she understands she's in a service position or representing a new business. Male staff was the exact opposite: friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and helpful, even brought me out extra salsa.  LOCATION: Parking lot is small, which may be a problem as they get more popular. Interior is a ghastly orange color, no decor to speak of, and the microwave is right in plain sight of the customers. Random bottles of generic salsa are out on counter.  Would suggest moving the microwave and adding a salsa bar to improve the interior.  This is a neighborhood with several solid Mexican restaurants, I'd only pick this place if you're specifically wanting dishes with vegan cheese/meat options as there are better veggie burritos nearby.  UPDATE 8/2018: I've been in a few more times. They've remodeled. The space has slightly improved but the service and food are still hit or miss to me. My food never comes out looking the way their social media photos do, and though the portions are large and prices are fair, the food itself just isn't as flavorful as other similar spots around town.",

The food in my opinion is really good, but at times they really just screw you over. Recently I've been ordering through Postmates to save myself the trip and 20-30 minutes wait sitting inside of the restaurant (they're really slow). Every.single.time with the past, I don't know 10+ orders they managed to screw things up. Usually I'll pardon simple mistakes, but with how frequent it is, I just can't. They've left out items from my order, added toppings to burgers, tacos, etc that I specifically asked them to leave out, not added toppings to items that I paid extra for.. I order the Beyond Burger frequently, asking them to add bacon and jalapenos..it's gotten to the point where I buy my own vegan bacon and some jalapenos to add myself because I know they won't add them. On a past order, I wrote in the \"special request\" box on Postmates that they didn't add the toppings I paid for last time, and would like them this time. They gave me the toppings but STILL charged me. I've called a few times to complain and not once have they given me an apology. They're usually just like \"oh..uh you can contact Postmates support and get a refund. We can't do anything\" or something similar to that. With the amount of food I've paid for and not received, I'd have enough money to get a couple meals there for free. It's just ridiculous. Time to find a new vegan taco shop :(",

The Posole I added \"chorizo\" the flavor was good by itself but better once I dressed it with limes, radish, cilantro and onions.   The tacos was exceptional. Full of flavor.

I find that very poor all around...   I've given to many \"benefit of doubts\" on how they could screw up a simple order, cold food, old food, tasteless food, maybe I explained it wrong? Maybe they're short staffed, maybe it's just one of those days? but I can't do that anymore, not at my families expense and not at my expense...   I want to be in love with Pancho's as I once was, I don't know what the change in vibe/crew was but it's obvious, ands it's definitely obvious in the food. Ive had breakfast, lunch, and dinner here, numerous times and I can no longer excuse my insanity, cause I keep coming over and over expecting a different result. But SIGH  I do not think I'll be back, at least for awhile, and by awhile I mean like a year.   Breakfast I was burping up ALL DAY. How is a breakfast burrito soupy? Why is my concha harder than a rock (swapped it out for a cookie, I didn't want it to, but i figured, better than a refund,THAN 5mins later they load fresh conchas?). Coffee refill a dollar? Get out of here...  Lunch and dinner, you better pray to vegan Jesus that it's not busy. Cause they don't do special orders, I mean it's best just not to do special orders. We've (we, being my family and I) have gotten our foods at different times,(not all served at once) cold food and OLD FOOD, buns, you know when it falls apart it's old. Not falls apart because it's big, I mean it crumbles...  As I said earlier I want to love Pancho's, but it's to much of a risk, yes this is Vegas, but not exactly the place I thought I'd have to gamble for my food...  Ps. I know store bought gauc when I taste it. Also  S M I L E  it does help, i never really seen any employee smile here? And maybe during busy hours put a senior staff on register, I'm not downing trainees. But at least some kind of support, \"I don't know\" is never a good answer (we need knowledge)... please consider a salamander grill some kind of heat lamp? But is that even an answer?   Making this review broke my heart, And I would not recommend this place to anyone. Pancho's was my \"go to\" spot when breaking into Veganism (1 year strong) and now it's crushing to look else where...  On a positive note, I now believe it's given me enough confidence in myself that I can do better for myself and family at home...  I believe in the vegan community, and I only want to see vegan options uplifted, but this place has changed and not for the better...",

Wouldn't be Panchos without a screw up. I waited for damn near a half hour for some tacos to go!   It just really bums me out. I've been to this restaurant four times now and this is my final time. The restaurant area looks very bad. The no AC just makes it even worse. They could at least paint the wall one color. It's a combination of multiple oranges where they painted over other things with the wrong color. The bathroom is the cleanest thing I've seen in this establishment and it's extremely clean.  I wish the rest of the restaurant reflected what the bathroom does which is typically the opposite of anywhere you go.  Such a great concept but what a crappy location and store in general.  The food is pretty good here but it's everything else that brings down the place. I figured maybe if I ordered to go this time I would be satisfied but no yet again it's something.",

    "text": "I had to sit back and realize this restaurant deserved an update on my previous review.   I continue to stand tall about exploring more kid menu options that make sense. It's difficult to get younger children to maintain the plant based eating habits. You have an opportunity to truly craft a solution that is much needed in this town, and in my favorite type of food, Mexican.   Taking this need and owning it could go a long way! It's also not advantageous as a parent to order the quesadilla and it be over $7.   I wanted to just get that tidbit out of the way so I can reinforce that aside from the suggestion - this restaurant still receives top marks.   The enchiladas are amazing, sopes and posole - just the way I remember, as well as street tacos and other popular favorites!   You get red or green sauce, or when you takeout - both, and it's phenomenal. I took advantage of the $1 Vegan donuts and yea, just had to. So delicious.   Panchos has become a frequent choice in my house and I'm always excited to try new dishes on their menu. The have taco Tuesday and follow their Facebook page for the occasional special offers or new meals!",

They put pineapple in it and it has to be one of the most perfect blends. We also got the arroz con leche and was hoping for that to be warm but nevertheless was still really good.   So good that we have to take food for the drive back home and food for when we got home cause it was that good. We got the same cuban torta and al pastor tacos and a chocolate cake and that chocolate cake was one of the best chocolate cakes i have ever had in my life no joke.",

Wait times can get somewhat long but the staff keeps you updated as much as possible and, honestly, why are you going out to eat if you're in THAT much of a rush? Also, they're a small business just starting out, you have to forgive if they're out of certain products-at least they let you know right off the bat instead of keeping you guessing. If I could donate a million dollars to any restaurant it would be this place. I can't get over how delicious and authentic the food tastes and how FRIENDLY!!! The staff is. I love this place so much, and I'm so glad they're expanding. Definitely make this place a regular one.",

    "text": "07/10/17 DINNER  Not good.  Hubby and I semi-vegan for a while. Tried many soy and gluten meat substitutes, never liked any except firm tofu. Hubby is amazing cook, uses tofu WELL in home cooking. He'd chef a great vegan restaurant if given the chance. Recently became full-time vegans for 5 months in prep for vacation. Only began playing with dairy substitutes at home, having good luck finding palatable ones.  Went to Pancho's with friend who had liked it his few previous visits.  Woman taking order at counter (walk in, order at counter, brought food to table) initially unfriendly and distracted, got her in better mood after a while. Paid with credit card, later discovered never given receipt, so can't confirm if 10% discounted, sign at counter states \"Meatless Monday\" 10% off. Ordered a lot of food because friend recommended it, stating portions were \"small\", but they really weren't.  SALSAS (CONTAINERS COME WITH MEAL) green: YES red: YES  SALSA (ON SIDE) pico de gallo: YES  MEATS Asada (gluten-based steak substitute): NO Chik-end (soy-based chicken substitute): NO turkey: NO ham: NO bacon: NO hotdog: NO tofu: MAYBE mushrooms: YES nopales (cactus): YES  DAIRY melting cheddar cheese: NO melting white cheese: MAYBE sprinkled cheese: MAYBE sour cream: MAYBE  DISHES - Classic Nachos ($8.99) with Chik-end: MAYBE. Mountainous. Avoided Chik-end. Sour cream, sprinkled cheese acceptable. Red/green salsas great when added to it. - Cuban Torta ($9.99): NO. Downright weird concept. - 3 Soft Street Tacos combo ($7.99): MAYBE. Vegetation (fresh cilantro, chopped onions) was fine. Out of 3 \"meats\" only mushrooms good. Supposed to come with rice & beans, never got those, hubby said via his burrito \"you didn't miss anything\". - Fried Rolled Potato Taco AKA Dorado ($1.50): NO. Bland. - Corn Quesadilla ($5.99): MAYBE. Mushrooms great. White cheese acceptable. - Classic Burrito ($7.99): NO. Ordered w/ mushrooms & nopales. Bland, virtually all rice, a few beans and very little mushrooms or nopales.  DRINKS Sangria soda ($2.50): YES. Arrived immediately. Tamarind soda ($2.50): YES. But had to go to counter to ask for drink halfway thru meal.  My tacos came to table quickly, but had to ask about potato taco & quesadilla after patiently waiting quite a while.  Overall consensus: BLAND. Where's the seasoning? The garlic? And spiciness? Only via hot sauce at front counter or red/green salsas. So do most vegans, or vegan americans, prefer bland food? This place would make you think so. Hubby went to the counter to ask for sliced jalapenos for his burrito, told they didn't have any. Cuban arrived with sliced jalapenos on it and stated so on the menu. WTF?  We won't be back.  PS With exception of 2 breakfast dishes (10am-1230pm) and \"Supreme Fries\" no avocado offered. And NO guacamole, at all. Crazy.",

I ordered chips and salsa which about $5, it was a meager amount of chips and decent blended salsa. Not worth $5. The salsa was decent, but I got a small amount of it. I was never asked what kind of salsa I might like, I was thinking I was getting a pico style, but again was not given any choices. Additionally, I tipped first which regretted since all they do is drop off your food. I had asked for water, what I got was 2 large cups of water with a tiny bit of ice. Not nitpicking, but since I tipped like $4 on a $15 order I was all around expecting much better. I don't plan on returning.",

This means that most of the time when it's time to eat, I have to take control my of the ingredients. That means I have to make my own lunch and dinner to make sure that there are no animal-based products on my plate. It's not like the old days when I could just stop at any ol' fast food place and order anything from the menu. But now there are more and more vegan restaurant options popping up and I'm glad for that. One of those places I'm glad for is Panchos Vegan Tacos. I've had almost everything on their menu and I haven't been disappointed yet... and all the ingredients are vegan! Nice! I highly recommend this place.

They recently updated their menu, and I think they made some great decisions! The new menu is way cleaner, easier to understand for newcomers, and has some great new options.  I recommend to a newcomer: The impossible burger, any of the wet burritos, and especially the asada fries! Everything at Pancho's is wonderful and the service is great.",

Food - I had the vegan taco plate, with one mushroom taco and two tacos with vegan meat. The mushrooms were sauteed to perfection and the vegan meat was cooked in a way that was flavorful and had a good texture. The plate came with rice and beans, which is always a must for any Mexican dish - and the portion was huge! To drink - Fountain Jones Soda?! Yum all the way. I have never had Jones Soda from the fountain, and that stuff was absolutely perfect.   Environment/Service - The staff was friendly, and the food came out relatively quickly. The environment was more on the casual side. Some booths and tables were spread out in a decent sized dining area. A lot of the tables were a little dirty, but hey - it's all good.   Will definitely be back to eat all the vegan menu items.",

One friend is vegan with me and the other friend eats meat but doesn't mind vegan options. There was a small line of people waiting to order which allowed us time to look over the menu. We wanted 1 of everyhting as the menu looked so delicious but we picked our selected items. Note there is a menu located by the register of unavailable menu items so we couldnt try the tamales or potato tacos :(.   Their menu has so many options from tacos, wet burritos, enchiladas, posole, tamales, tostadas, nachos, desserts and etc. We placed our order to go and everything was ready in a timely manner. They were pretty busy with a full restaurant but most guests were waiting for to go orders. Our nachos and tostadas were bomb but the enchiladas with red sauce and wet burrito with red sauce were WAY too spicey. We also had the green sauce on the side and it was way TOO hot too so unfortunately we won't be ordering those options anymore. They were hard to enjoy but everything else was great!",

The presentation of the nachos was so appetizing that one of the patrons asked if they could take a picture of my food. Their portions are also very generous, especially for the price.  The only thing I disliked was that the ratio of nachos to toppings was not proportionate. If you're like me and you love your toppings, this may be a problem for you. I wish the classic nachos were served with queso instead of shredded cheese so it would be easier to get cheese on every bite. I also wish there was more than just a drizzle of sour cream on top and a dollop of guacamole because there's no way you could get more than just a few chips with sour cream and guac on them.  The street tacos tasted great, I have no complaints there. Next time I eat here I will probably be ordering more tacos instead of nachos. Overall, I think it's a nice place for vegan Mexican food.",

The tacos are the perfect size and I love to come here for the Taco Tuesday deal when I can. The soy chorizo is probably my favorite, and so much tastier than actual chorizo.   The fries are MASSIVE!! I've tried both kinds twice and each time we haven't been able to finish even half of them. But so good. The cheese is delicious. Again I try to stay away from dairy because it makes me sick but Pancho's cheese just has such a great taste and doesn't make you feel bloated.  This place is VERY tiny so be prepared for that! Ive has a time where we had to wait around for seats. The staff is super quick, and even when the place is packed they work hard to get you your food quick.

I can't believe the prices are this low, quite honestly -- they could easily justify charging double and I'd still pay it.",

We found out about Pancho's when we moved to Vegas a year ago and I can honestly say this is some legit Mexican food. Hand down my favorite place to eat in town. The only down side is that I want to order about 5 or 6 different items every time I go. Going to be a big problem for me when the new one opens about 5 minutes from our house. Oh yeah and they have the impossible burger too!",

    "text": "Found an all vegan taco shop, yes! I drove to Vegas to meet friends and stopped by here at the end of my drive before going to strip which has more limited vegan options. I ordered the Friday special, a burrito. It was a lot of beans and rice in a large tortilla. This definitely isn't healthy vegan food, it's comfort food and very hearty and filling. Also very simple, for my protein I got mushrooms and there was some lettuce and tomato but that was it. It ended up being two meals for me and I loved the tortilla. It's a very casual place, you order at the counter and there's cafeteria like seating. The mexican place next door has vegan options as well if you don't find something you want on the menu. It's located in a more run down area just off the strip at a major intersection so there's lots of traffic and congestion by the restaurant but for me it felt like it was worth the trip. It's also by the university so saw a lot of students dropping in. The other thing I love was how affordable the food was. You sometimes see someone add a vegan label and hike up the price even if you're getting something super simple but Panchos Vegan was very reasonably priced. I liked my food a lot, wish I had room for dessert. They had a huge menu and lots of different appetizers, entrees, protein options, desserts, and tacos. Would highly recommend for any vegans visiting Vegas. it is a little inconvenient if you don't have a car because you have to leave the strip but if you have time, I think it's worth the detour.",

They are super active with the Vegas vegan community and, to date, have the best Vegan nachos I've had (potentially best nachos ever all around)!",

I love my food extremely seasoned so maybe it was just me. I was also disappointed when I saw the beans had no cheese on top. I know they do make vegan cheese. The rice was good.

The food is super heavy but I assumed it would be before trying. I missed robertos carne asada fries so bad once I went vegan but now I found my replacement :)",

Again, the food was great. But the employees have a big role to play with the whole restaurant experience.",

The service is more friendly, the inside is more roomy, and the execution of the dishes seem even better as well.  I especially enjoyed their mole enchiladas with vegan chicken.  It had the perfect balance of sweet and spicy (somewhat more sweet than spicy which I like) and had that authenticity of a real mole which I had before I became vegetarian and had missed until now.  The portion size of their dishes are generous and the food is an excellent value.  I highly recommend this restaurant!",

The tamales are delicious and it's nice to know that I can go to a restaurant and get these delicious delights without the use of lard. The veggie meat that is used in the green tamales isn't the best consistency. It has zero texture and although it looks like meat, it's just mushy. The street tacos are delicious and flavorful.   A note or two on the service and atmosphere.: When entering into the restaurant and guests to the right to order, one can see cables hanging under the desk, packing boxes behind the person taking the order and employee drinks in plain site. It always feels a bit awkward ordering, like the person taking the order isn't at all happy to be there and they barely smile or make guests feel welcome. About half the time that I order a glass of water, it makes it to me. The food runners awkwardly place the tray on your table (or a nearby table) when bringing out food. Either use a \"tray-stand\" or hold the tray while taking food off it, this is food running 101.   Overall this place it ok and I hope they pay attention to yelp reviews and adjust accordingly.",

The food was good, but the air conditioning was broken (90 degrees outside and hotter inside.) The only person tasked with helping customers in the dining area, was inept at customer service. AND if that wasn't enough, we watched her spill chips on the middle of the floor and during our entire visit ( at least 45 minutes) she never cleaned them up and led people through the chips to break and distribute evenly throughout the dining area.  I've been vegan for almost 7 years, but this experience has turned me off to ever trusting Pancho's again. If you allow for this type of uncleanliness and outwardly bad service, what are you doing to the food behind kitchen walls? Thanks, but no thanks. There are soooo many other vegan options out there that take every customer seriously.",

    "text": "I came here based on the reviews and for the fact that my cousin has been wanting to bring me here as well.. well I'm in Vegas visiting, finally so we came here to eat a late lunch. When you drive up to this place, it's in a strip mall with a large banner that says vegan mexican food. The door says Pancho's so I knew we were at the right spot. You order inside and than they give you a number and have you sit down in the dinning area. The cashier was older, some what friendly. We did dine in and there were only two tables open that didn't have a mess all over them.. so we ended up grabbing the one by the kitchen.   Anyways we sat down and didn't have to wait long for our food to come out. The waitress brought out our food and we realized that one of the items she brought out we didn't order. We even pulled out the receipt to later find out the cashier charged us for a combo meal instead of a single item. Granted they let us keep the combo and gave us back the money for the mistake, but that's besides the point.   Onto the food. I ordered the potato taquitos, they were very bland. They came out looking good, mini salad on top and all.. but the taquitos themselves were just potatoes shoved inside a corn tortilla and deep fried. I tasted no seasoning on the potato. Granted I got two of these and I had to dip it in some salsa to give it some flavor. I also got the vegan ceviche, it tasted nothing like ceviche. It honestly tasted like overly spicy salsa on a soggy tostada with a spoonful of fake guacamole on top. Lastly I ordered some horchata, ya that was a mistake.. it had the aftertaste of bubblegum.. which in fact I knew right away that it wasn't original. If you're going to promote your business as an authentic vegan mexican restaurant, than do just that.. I've been to plenty of vegan mexican restaurants in other states that taste authentic.. this place wasn't and I was disappointed for the fact that I wish it was better.",

Anyway, I digress--not only are the nachos delicious, so is everything that comes out of this is place. The best part? EVERYTHING on the menu is vegan (and is affordable AND muy authentico!).  The ambiance is super casual: grab a menu and make your way to the front to place your order. Once you've gotten that under way, find an empty table and relax while the kitchen conducts a little magic. Before you know it, Pancho's fantastic staff will be out with your food. If you're anything like me, you will order way too much and then try to eat it all because it's amazing (no judgement here, after all, I feel ya!).   It's noteworthy to mention that Pancho's is great for  herbivores and omnivores alike. I've been numerous times and my company is always non-vegan; I've repeatedly heard nothing but praise for the amazing food. Do yourself and try out one of my new favorite spots, I promise you'll love it.",

    "text": "Wow, this was just what I needed. The food here is delicious and the prices are very reasonable especially for being vegan. I had been wanting some Mexican food other than fried potato tacos. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate that option at several local restaurants but Pancho's has a full menu.  I had the Chilaquiles with both green and red sauce and it was really good. I decided to add a full size taco and picked the mushroom as the \"meat\" and what a great choice. It was the best thing we ate. My wife who is NOT vegan loved the taco too. She ordered two potato tacos and was not expecting much but she came away really impressed. The chips and salsa were good too. We saw a couple of guys order the nacho plate, man it was huge.   The place had a continuous flow. You walk up an order and they call you up. Place was really plain but nice and most importantly clean. Will come back when I am in town.",

    "text": "I'm new to the Vegan world as of January 1st but my friend who helped get me on board with this cruelty free lifestyle change took me to Panchos .  The food is really really good for the price especially being Vegan but I can give 5 stars because my Tamale was essentially the most dried out thing that wasn't even edible and they messed up our order .  We dined inside but before that we stood in a pretty long line to be helped . When ordered a blonde guy with a pony tale was going to take our order till I asked what the products were made with (I have a soy intolerance ) anyway he had Zack take the order in which not only did we order lunch but my friends got their dinner to go and asked for sauce on the side which didn't end up happening and had to be remade later on . Once we placed our order we found a seat.  The food came out as it was ready I guess but my friends all got their food and I was waiting for my one asada taco which was delicious , potato taco which I wasn't wowsers over and I already discussed my jalapeno and cheese Tamale that essentially was just a waste of money . I can say Vegan tamales I got from sprouts and made myself were better which is why I can't go to four stars but especially with the Service .  My food came last and they didn't offer or bring me any salsa or dipping sauces . There was a woman browsing around asking if we were okay but she didn't really know where my food was and later when our to go order was wrong nobody seemed apologetic but they made sure to charge for the refills .  Overall it's affordable Vegan with tons of variety and decent quality items..   My friends got nachos with mushroom which were okay but I felt lacking sauce ...  I really liked the taste of the asada and for vegan it's worth trying I just hope you get better help than I received",

Everything tasted great - I had zero complaints. No meal would be complete at a taco shop without some horchata. As far as I know, Pancho's Tacos is the only place in town with vegan horchata. I've also tried the Gran Torta ($9.99), which is not to fuck with. Seriously, it's loaded up with chorizo, ham, cheese, and who knows what else. Just eat it.  Oh yeah, did I forget to mention the menu is 100% vegan? Pancho's is a vegan hotspot, but on the two times that I've been here omnis have waltzed in with no idea this place was even a vegan restaurant. Notably, they stayed to try out the food so kudos to Pancho's for exposing the masses to good Mexican vegan food.    INSIDER TIP: Word on the street is that the owner of this lovely taco shop was a professional soccer player!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2017: #12",

    "text": "I think it's important to start off this review letting you know that I'm not vegan, far from it. However, one of my favorite foods is Mexican. To say I was skeptical of this place would be an understatement. Boy was I wrong!  I was in Las Vegas visiting a friend who moved out there. She's vegan and suggested we come here as it's one of her favorites. I hesitantly agreed, but I'm glad that I went in with an open mind.  I guess my concept of vegan food was limited to tofu so I was pleasantly surprised when I read things like chorizo and asada on the menu. Of course it wasn't meat, but it wasn't tofu either! Also the menu was extensive and has familiar Mexican food items like tortas, sopes, and enchiladas. Of course it also has the staples: tacos and burritos.  I was throughly impressed by the prices and more importantly the prices in relation to quality and portion. It was right in line with prices I see at any of my favorite local Mexican restaurants. I was expecting higher than normal prices, maybe because I'm from LA and anything vegan typically carries a higher price tag here.  But it all came down to taste. I had a wet burrito. It was recommended by one of the girls working there to get it with both the red and green sauce. What a great idea! The two sauces complimented each other perfectly! My friend and I also shared supreme fries. These rivaled any supreme fries I've had on any drunken night and if I were drunk, you could have fooled me telling me the cheese was vegan!  This is a must try spot! Be open minded and I promise you'll enjoy it!",

    "text": "I never thought I'd say this, but their vegan al pastor tacos are better than the al pastor at most traditional taco shops. Talk about seasoning!   Pancho's is bringing affordable vegan food to the masses and what better way than by Mexican food! I've eaten here a handful of times and my food never disappoints. I have to admit I've had all of their meat and I'm sure you know my favorite is al pastor. I've had their tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and nachos. They also carry soup and tamales.  If you need a recommendation then definitely do the tacos or a quesadilla on corn tortilla. I feel like the burrito has way too much everything else in it and then the non-melted cheese on the nachos are a put off. The quesadillas with melted vegan cheese is amazing!  My only suggestion to get that last star is their customer service and the store cleanliness. I'm sure they run on a tight profit margin, but they need to step up their ordering system to be more organized. Also they could really spice up their beans and rice. Hate to admit but they are pretty bland.   Definitely check out Pancho's to help save the earth. They have awesome weekly specials like taco Tuesday! Theirs includes three tacos and a drink for less than five bucks. It's very affordable and centrally located.",

The tacos were delicioussss and 4 of them was enough for me to be satisfyingly full lol - and trust me, I can eat a lot. Their food comes out fast too. Their restaurant was fairly busy the day we came in, but we got our food quick. The staff was very polite and professional. Greeted me as I walked in, checked on me while I was eating, and said goodbye to me as I left.  Only downside I can say is that their horchata was not that good. It tastes very powdery and the residue sticks in your mouth. Hopefully, the horchata is different the next time around. The jamaica was a good though - not too sweet, and has a touch of that tart flavor. On the plus side, they give free refills for the horchata and jamaica.",

    "text": "I came here after seeing so many good posts about this place in the \"Las Vegas Vegans\" Facebook group. Honestly, I was disappointed...  I told the owner to order me his 2 favorite dishes. He chose the enchiladas and a torta. I was not impressed with either. The enchiladas came with rice and beans. The rice was okay, but the beans lacked flavor (tasted like water).   It seems as though the chef went through the vegan freezer section and bought all the fake meats and cheeses, put them together, and called it cooking. This is 100% fast food for junk food vegans. If you are looking for food with any nutritional value, this is not the place.   That being said, I do think this place is a great transition for stubborn carnivorous junk food eaters. You might even be able to trick a meat eater into eating here! I applaud Pancho's for spreading veganism and was happy to see how busy they were when I went in. Over half the tables were full when I went!   The owner and the staff were incredibly friendly. The owner kept checking on me, and he was ready to answer any questions I might have had. So although I'm not the biggest fan of the food, I really like the staff and appreciate their spread of vegan knowledge. I honestly wish nothing but success for this place!   *They may want to change their name though, because Pancho's Kitchen is AMAZING healthier vegan Mexican food so people may have higher expectations if they see Pancho's Tacos with the similar name.",

It was completely worth it, I'm very happy to say! From the moment I walked in I received such friendly and warm service ...not sure what the man's name was behind the counter, maybe he was the owner? Or just an awesome employee. Anyhow I told him it was my first time and he made some suggestions to which I chose the Cuban torta. He brought it out not long after, and it looked like a typical sandwich, one bite into it though and this was heaven! The bread was perfectly crisp yet soft inside, the produce was fresh and cold, the faux meats were tender -not rubbery -and flavorful enough. The avocado was perfectly ripe! And just the right right amount of onions to give it a little kick.  I will definitely be making trips out here for ponchos vegan tacos again... And again!",

This place has completely assuaged that fear of never tasting asada, al pastor, and chorizo ever again. The flavors and textures are completely on point, I couldn't have asked for a better food experience. We also had a great service experience as well.  I got a northern Mexican sope al pastor, a taco de asada, and a wet burrito al pastor as well. The tacos are authentic street tacos, so all they have are the meat, cilantro, and onion, which worried me because so many meat substitutes are overcooked, but it was absolutely perfect. I would recommend everything that I ordered to anyone, vegan or not! :)",

The staff has always been awesome. They have grown in options and I have not tried many of them all but my husband enjoys the torta cubana and the sopes! You can never go wrong with Pancho's!

My rolled potato tacos were really, really lacking in filling. All I could tasted was the corn tortilla and a few bites didn't even have potato. I also didn't like the horchata. Too bland for my taste buds. The rice and beans are bomb. My vegan sister really loved the tacos. Order at the counter then go take a seat. Nice, friendly people.",

The mole enchiladas I ordered with the chick-end as well, mole was ok in taste but was waaay too thick, almost like a paste. The potato tacos were very very yummy, but honestly never ordered any potato tacos that weren't... you can never go wrong with that. So food quality I'd say 3.5 stars. I took off another star for the terrible customer service. The guy taking the orders (older guy in his 40's) in the front was arrogant and rude. Seemed annoyed that a customer came in, acted like he was super busy and the place was pretty empty. I asked which meat he'd recommend for the pozole and he looked so annoyed and said \"I really don't know, whatever you feel like\", was very unfriendly and snappy. I also witnessed a Uber Eats guy come in and was told they were out of the horchata which had been ordered... It was 4 pm how do you run out of such popular drink at that time of the day? Also, why allow the order to be placed for an item you don't have? Then, another lady came in a little after us and ordered a burger. Minutes later they came out and told her they were out of buns that they would have to make it with regular sandwich bread. Wtf? Oh, and I forgot to mention that I noticed my mole being heated in the microwave, not sure if that is the reason why it was so thick. But honestly, I'll stick with my vegan restaurants here in California. Maybe next time I'm in Vegas I'll find a good quality Vegan place that treats customers nicely.",

    "text": "I tried this place and was very hopeful after reading mixed reviews. So- their food is decent but not like super good. Their soups are delicious- prob my favorite part of my order. The carnitas street tacos were pretty good, wish they had a bit more seasoning on the \"meat\", their red salsa was bomb so I just slathered it with that and lime juice, you could almost not tell it wasn't actually meat. I also ordered the potato rolled tacos and was not impressed- it's like two French fries in a corn tortilla and then I specifically asked them to put the cheese on the side (because sometimes I don't like vegan cheeses and I did not like theirs), but they put the cheese all over my tacos anyway and when I called to complain (via Grubhub) because I couldn't eat the tacos with the nasty cheese all over them I was told that my order was right and that they put the cheese on the side and I will not be refunded. They did agree to refund me for the horchata that I order and didn't receive.   My overall take is I wish this place had better customer service. If they screw up your order and you can't eat it because of it, you will not be refunded- they will blame the customer and you'll be out of money. Really bad bad service, wish it wasn't so... I won't be returning for that specific reason. It's the principle...they said I was lying about my food being wrong instead of taking responsibility for their mistake.   Okay so today it's over a month since I wrote the review for Panchos and I was literally like attacked on Facebook by them for writing a real review and in their response they just straight up completely lied, then made it so I couldn't even respond to them because I guess they needed \"the last word\". Big tip- don't accuse your customers of lying when they are not. I'm not the only person commenting on your awful customer service. Just fix it!!! I've attached a pic of the Facebook post where they were upset about my review and then disabled me from responding. To be clear- they never offered a refund like I've detailed before. And Grubhub was not the issue, they were. I will still use Grubhub to order food but will never go to this place, that says something!  Also, I found a vegan place here in Vegas I love called vegetation and they don't blame their customers or try to shift the blame to Grubhub when they mess up, I promise!    Maybe the next time they get a bad review they will actually reach out to the customer to correct it instead of just lying on the internet and saying they did. The management here are just straight up liars. Bad service, don't go!!!!",

I wasn't a huge fan of the adobada. I would have offered 5 stars but the employee working the register didn't know the special that was offered on FB on the day we went. After discussing the special and showing the FB page my friend and I ordered separately. From the time she ordered to the time I ordered the employee forgot about the discount and charged me extra. Since the price wasn't that huge of a difference I didn't bother saying anything. That and it being super hot is why this place didn't receive a 5 star review. However, I would still come back and still recommend going here. :-)",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this place when a flyer was placed in my windshield I've always wanted an all vegan Mexican food restaurant in vegas rather than traveling all the way to LA. I stopped by with my bff for lunch and give this place a try, while ordering i thought since I'm in a Mexican restaurant that (the cahier) she'll speak Spanish but nope she was quick to get a little defensive and said I don't speak Spanish (whooops my bad lady don't hate me) **RUDE**  anyway I ordered the tacos \" 1 asada & 1 al pastor\" sooo good just that the salsa was a little plain I'm Mexican we like our salsa spicy ASF lol and also ordered a torta cubana, now if you look at the menu it list all the ingredients/components to the \"Torta Cubana\" when it came to my table it was missing everything the menu listed, so I went up and ask the cashier if she got my order right you know just to make sure she if misunderstood me. Her reply was again rudely! \"oh i don't know why the owners will list that or why that's even on the menu we don't do that\" ok i replied \"that's fine\" but inner me was like WTF? (In my head) first of all don't put items in YOUR menu if they are not available hint: (scratch it off) anyway the plain torta was sooo good & I didn't take a picture of it but I'll come here again just next time I order I'll make sure to ask if the item is AVAILABLE before they say no to me.  Lol the place has a lot of potential but it seems a little sad like make it look Mexican with interior design where's the Mexican music you know make it look like I'm at home eating (give it a vibe) it was so quiet. I give 5 stars for your food but 4 for customer service. By the way let her know to practice her customer service skills.",

My orders have taken upwards of 8-10 mins after ordering. The rice has been old, and hard. The pinto beans have been dry and semi-hard. The food has been lukewarm and the \"asada\", has been dry and hard. I'm hoping the owners are reading these reviews and are open to rectifying these issues immediately. I gave three stars because the staff are always pleasant. Even though I'm offended they're serving me old food",

I chose 2 asada, 1 pastor and 1 chorizo.  I liked them all except the chorizo had more of a vegan texture with the flavoring of chorizo.  The other two actually had me fooled, in a good way with lots of flavor.  The two salsas were perfect additions, but I preferred the green one to the red one.  I got a plate to go for a friend and she liked the asada more than the pastor, but agreed that it was flavorful!  Can not wait to go back!",

    "text": "I love this place with all my heart. When I went vegan I thought I gave up my street taco life (I was so wrong). They have plant based meats for asada, al pastor, chorizo, chicken and offer veggies like mushrooms and nopales (cactus).   The menu has everything from street tacos, to pozole, to tamales, to loaded nachos... and even ice cream now?! And donuts on the weekend! I've been here at least a dozen times and always leave with a happy belly and wallet. Great pricing and each day of the week has its own special.  Monday-meatless Monday 10% off (must mention it) Tuesday-Taco Tuesday  Wednesday-classic nachos Thursday-tostadas Friday-burritos Saturday-sopes Sunday-breakfast platter special  My favorite thing here hands down are the asada street tacos. The quesadilla is dynamite as well. I don't think the cheese nachos are very popular since they always make sure I want those instead of classic nachos but they are so delicious. The cheese is a sauce and it comes with jalapenos. You can add any \"meat\" for $1 --ASADA! Simple and delicious. Classic nachos are loaded up with sour cream, shredded cheese, guac and more and also good.   The wet burrito is humongous and you can get it with both red and green sauces. Loaded fries are a dream as well. Can you tell I've basically tried the whole menu? They even have a huge breakfast burrito served until 12 (I think) any day of the week. It's tasty but I wish they put potatoes or fries in the burrito for better texture. That's really my toughest critic!   They are in the middle of a renovation and expansion so they have a temporary set up for the register and waiting area. The staff is always so nice and the same sweet lady is always there to take my order or bring us our food. I love you Panchos!",

They even have tamales for winter!   My favorite thing to get from Pancho's is the asada street taco combo, Which includes three street tacos with beans and rice. It comes with quite a bit of food and usually I can only get through the rice and two tacos before I'm completely stuffed.   I have also tried the impossible burger from here but I wasn't a huge fan - I'll stick to the tacos.   Parking is plentiful as it is located in a shopping center and the prices are great! For two street taco combo's and two waters we paid about $17. What a joke!!   Pro tip: check in on yelp and you'll get a 10% off coupon too!",

What's not to love? I came in while they were having the taco Tuesday special which included four tacos for $4.85! There is also the option of getting 3 tacos and 1 drink for the same price. I also ordered the small size of the supreme fries and the portion was huge! I can't even imagine how much comes out for the large size.",

This place is at the top of the list as one of the best Mexican shops we've had the pleasure to eat at.   We came on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesday!!!) And got the special 3 tacos w/a drink and the 4 tacos. We tried the asada, al pastor,  chorizo, and cactus.   Be warned! Chorizo is super Spicy! But delicious.  We loved it so much we ordered 8 more tacos lol  Then chocolate ice cream...guys...it was like eating fudge...so goooooooood.   We got here around 7 (1 he before closing) and they were packed.  Update: we came back for breakfast and got al pastor loaded fries and al pastor burrito and they were bomb too!",

Tonight we ordered the 3 taco special that comes with a drink for 6.99. Those were great as always, my fav.   We also ordered the the classic nachos, oh my gosh were those huge! Way more than the two of us could eat and they were delicious too. I forgot to snap a picture of just how big and pretty they were. I liked them a lot though,  I wish the cheese could have been melted into the chips before adding all the rest of the toppings. For the cheese being vegan it is good but would be better melted.   As for Panchos itself, this place is always busy! They're actually expanding right now into the unit right next door. The set up is great. They take the orders in the old room and you sit and wait in the expansion room. The menu also looks larger than the last time I was there. They're offering burgers, no-so-tuna melts and even breakfasts.   I've heard the tamales were good, I need to try those next time. They sell them by the dozen, just check ahead of time if they have any.   Thumbs up to Panchos!  Yummm!",

I would compare it to the omnis version of a \"Robertos\" type place. Junk food.  100% vegan. Grub Hub and Uber Eats.  We tried a variety of items most of which have Daiya :( cheese. But I can overlook that because we completely forgot to request minus. *punches self in face*  Chorizo Quesadilla- not sure what we were thinking ordering this, the chorizo was yum but we couldn't get past the Daiya goo factor. It was warm yet had that outer crispiness, prepared perfectly.  Wet Burrito-best item we ordered, huge a filled with yumminess we opted for Ascada and glad we did.  Potato rolled tacos- fried and crisp these were super yum but of course they are fried. The white looking lettuce and mayo globs were a shock and total taste turnoff but the fresh sliced avocado on top made up for the goo globs.  Nachos Al Pastor-covered and piled high these had amazing flavor. The meat choice I picked was a great decision. Once again I should have opted minus the Daiya shreds goo and the glowing bright white lettuce.  The hibiscus water is soooo yummy. Its NOT sweet and the tart taste goes perfect with the food. Wish I opted to try the Horchata but neither hubs nor I like cinnamon nor care for sweet stuff.  All and all the food is fast food, I'm willing to try other items like the tacos....but we do not like corn tortillas and wish they would opt for greener lettuce and less processed products.   Better than Taco Bell, def not health food, yet cruelty free compassion based grub. Support local business.   Just A-Ok.",

The meat resembled veggie  beef crumbles with too much cumin .  The horchata was weird and very liquidity. Kinda like watered down almond milk and cinnamon lol. I was so excited to try it. Maybe the next batch of carne asada will hit the spot. Regardless, I still love this place. Service is fast and you can get a filling meal under $12.",

The few times I have been here, customer service was terrible. The food is okay, nothing crazy special to rave about. Definitely over priced for what you get.  Moving forward, I went here yesterday for lunch, and now I'm suffering from food poisoning. I called to inform them something was bad. The manager basically said that it was impossible for me to be sick from their food because they don't use meat or dairy products to cause cross-contamination. I don't think he understands that germs and bacteria can be spread through unsafe food handling procedures such as simple hand washing. Worst of all, the manager didn't even offer to follow-up with the kitchen or look into the situation.  If someone is reporting a sickness, whether you think you're at fault or not, the situation needs to be addressed in the kitchen in a serious manner to ensure other customers' health are not put at risk.  I did not call to complain; I called to inform.  All, in all... They have a history of not passing health inspections. If you decide to eat here, just be aware of what you're eating.",

I have had some great burritos in my days, but this one, beats them all.  There Menu is super extensive yet easy to understand. They have a lot of options, soup, tacos, burritos, Tamales, and all kinds of different fresh fruit drinks. The price is honest, amd the food is superb. I will keep coming to this place because thet have the authentic taste down. The rice and beans were spot on.  The play list playing of music was awesome as well. very inviting and clean restaraunt and everyone was so nice.  I phone ordered my meal and when i got there the place was so clean, and the atmospheric vibe was way up, i decided to stay. As i sat down a guy made a comment about me phone ordering it in and said it was smart. We got talking, and another customer jumped in and said \"its great here, i come all the time and i am not even  Vegan\" and i swear he had like three different things going on and they all looked good. The other guy had the taco deal with a side a guac and cheese and it looked great but in the end i am so happy with what i got.  By the way they have a special everyday amd on tuesday its \"taco tuesday\" deal.  At any rate, hope you check this spot out and love as much as i do.",

Luckily, I survived and enjoyed my meal in ignorance. I would have to say it was pretty good. It was like the Robertos of vegan restaurants and I'm sure most Robertos are probably teeming with roaches themselves. The rating I gave was partly for the awareness after the fact and feeling slightly disturbed by that, and for the service. The woman at the counter seemed super unenthusiastic and was not very attentive. The meal itself took a while and when it came out it was alright. I may give them a chance again in the future if they have a clean bill of health and maybe some friendlier faces inside.  So I ate here again when they were at the vegas veg fest and had a very good experience. The vegan carne Asana fries and horchata were delicious.",

The staff is super friendly and helpful and willing to walk new vegetarians or people who are just trying out the Weekday Vegetarian thing out for the first time through it. They have 6 different kinds of faux meat, and all of them are good.

I had a couple of tacos and a sope, while my partner had the pozole. The food was on point! The tacos were pretty much the selling point for me, so when we visited the other day for our third time, we each got a trio of the \"meat\" tacos (al pastor, asada, chorizo). The tacos were packed full of protein and flavor. I highly recommend this place to vegetarians/vegans and even omnivores. The food has always been stellar. I just wish there was a location in Tucson, AZ. But, I guess Pancho's is just another reason to visit Vegas! Also, the location is undergoing some amazing renovations, expanding the space and branding their name.",

    "text": "I can't believe that there is a Mexican restaurant that is completely vegan! And on top of that, it's actually really, really good!  So I actually had this place bookmarked a few weeks ago since its not that far from where I live. I had looked at a few of the pictures and saw the 4.5 star ranking and figured any place with this many good reviews I need to try. I saw they had Vegan tacos but I assumed they just had a few items, not the whole menu. I'm not vegan, but I have recently been trying some vegan food in an attempt to eat healthier. I found the fact that this place is completely plant based to be a pleasant surprise.  So my wife and I ordered too much food as usual (thank you for to-go boxes) and were very happy with almost everything. We got the nachos with \"asada\", five different types of tacos, potato taquitos and a Cuban torta.  The nacho cheese sauce was fantastic and you couldn't tell it wasn't real cheese. We asked how it was made and told us it is made with potatoes, carrots and nutritional yeast, plus some secret ingredients. I would eat this over the usual neon yellow nacho cheese any day.  The torta was my favorite thing, and again I couldn't tell it wasn't real meat. It had \"ham\" and \"turkey\" and \"hot dogs\", along with tofu, avocado and \"cheese\". Though I wouldn't call this a Cuban, it was easily the equal of any other torta I have ever had.  The taquitos were one of only two things that weren't that great (I'll get to the other later). It's not that they were bad, it's just that they weren't as good as the other food we had. They potato didn't really stand out as a filler for the taquitos, but they were pretty decent after being dipped in salsa. If you are a person that likes taquitos more for the crunch of the fried tortilla than the meat inside you'll probably like these. I could see myself ordering them again if I was in the right mood.  For the tacos we got one \"asada\", one \"pastor\", one \"chorizo\", one \"chicken\" and one mushroom. The mushroom (the only one not trying to imitate meat), while far from traditional was delicious. Along with the mushroom we also loved the chorizo, which you couldn't tell wasn't real chorizo. The chicken was also very good and tasted like chicken, and the pastor could pass for pork but was a little to sweet for my taste. The only one we didn't really care for that much was the \"asada\". We also ordered the asada on our nachos and it was by far the least favorite \"meat\" we tried. It wasn't so much that it was bad, but it didn't taste anything like carne asada or beef in general for that matter. Its consistency was more like a sausage than steak, and it's probably the only thing we wouldn't get again.  There was also one additional meat, cactus, which we didn't try but I guess we will get that next time. I can't really hold the \"asada\" against them considering I have yet to find a vegan substitute for beef that actually taste like beef. I have now had vegan cheese, eggs, pork and chicken and loved each one, but I guess beef is much harder to pull off.  The prices were on par with any other Mexican place you'd go to, though I thought the torta for $10 was a little high, despite how good it was. The nachos on the other hand for $5, with the option to add meat for a $1, are a fantastic deal.  Even if your not vegan, but you enjoy Mexican food, I highly recommend coming here. If you are vegan then this place is a must.",

    "text": "I went there for late lunch and ordered one asada, one al pastor taco, asada sope and an horchata. The seitan for the asada is flavorful, however, the texture is too spongy for my taste.  The al pastor seitan had the same type of spongy texture as the asada, but this one lacked  flavor. I wouldn't order it again.   What I  was really pleased with  was the sope. The dough was not greasy, not undercooked, not too thick.  Also, the beans were on point, soft and had its own flavor. The sour cream didn't  really taste like anything and the shredded cheese looked more like mozzarella cheese  instead of queso fresco or cotija which is what it's  traditionally served with. The horchata water was by far the only item you couldn't  that was vegan. It had that sweet and cinnamony taste that regular horchata has. I knocked down 3 stars due to the following:  So, I left this place thinking about giving it 3 stars, maybe 4, maybe. However,  around dinner time I called in to place an order for a pick up. I knew they closed at 8:00 PM and it was 7:40 already which is why I called it in. A man answered the phone and when I asked him if I could place an order for a carry out, he paused and said \" you wanna place an order right before we close?\" Mind you, they still had another 20 minutes to go. How rude. I told him I knew that and would be there within 10 minutes. He then proceeded to take my order.  Also, the establishment seemed cleaned but it was extremely hot in there and when I arrived the cashier lady was all by herself at the front. She was taking orders, taking them out, cleaning tables. She was really hustling. And she (cashier/bus lady/server) told me  that the A/C wasn't working  properly so maybe I just went on the wrong day. No big deal. Regardless, the place is missing decorations. The walls seemed to have been painted recently  with a burnt orange color. And that's all that was done to it. Also, the chairs and tables are extremely worn down.   This place has potential but lacks customer service, uniformity and the food needs improvement.",

We went 2 days in a row, day one (our first time ever being there) I ask the older lady if I could see a menu, they were right in front of her so I thought she'd grab one and hand it to me, but she just pointed at them and didn't say anything. So not too big of a deal but day 2 we didn't seem to have any problems or complaints right away, besides the fact we didn't get our drink until the food came, food was delicious! When we were heading out, I asked if we could get a refill in a to-go cup, she looked at me like she was confused at first and walked over to get it. I overheard the older lady talking about a Pepsi (we ordered a dr.pepper so maybe she wasn't referring to us) but the other girl said \"yes, they're just trying to be slick, it clearing says on the menu. Fucking stupid\". I was so confused, maybe she wasn't referring to us but why talk about any customer like this, especially when others are listening. I asked if they charge for refills and she said \"not the first one\" ???? I looked on the menu and saw they charge for the AGUAS FRESCAS but nowhere does it say FOUNTAIN DRINK ???? Didn't know it would be such a big deal hahaha. Wish I didn't experience this because I would have loved to go back but I'm turned off from this experience. These people seriously need an attitude adjustment.",

They also make Conchas, which is one of my favorite \"pastries\". I love that more vegan restaurants are opening up in town. This one is def my favorite!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this, but I will have to give it three stars, and I may be a little generous. The restaurant itself was clean and didn't have loud annoying music blaring, I got my order to go and that is where the problems started. I ordered dinner for myself and my husband, along with dessert. I was unable to eat the dessert because it was just way to sweet. I like sweet things, but this was just too sugary. The cake seemed a little hard, so I don't think it was fresh baked. The only flavor I could get out of it was \"sweet\". The rolled tacos were okay, they were filled with potato, which I knew before ordering, but there was just not enough flavor to them. Included in the take out bag was two small containers of sauce. The red one was very hot, but kind of tasteless and the green one was very mild and also tasteless. The tacos were crispy, but that is all I could really say for them. The rice had no flavor either, it really needed some spices and maybe some chopped green onions or something in it to make it flavorful. I don't know for sure, but I don't think the rice was very fresh either. The beans also were not flavorful, I was so disappointed! I tasted my husbands burrito (get your mind out of the gutter!!!), and it was the tastiest thing we ordered, but still not that great, it was filled with the same rice that was served on the side.   The worst part of this whole thing (PLEASE TAKE NOTE FOLKS WHO ORDER THEIR FOOD TO GO) is the boxes they put the food in are not at all sturdy. They put the boxes in a bag that is just big enough to fit. When I tried taking out the first big box, the contents ended up in the bag. I appreciate the fact that the boxes are good for the environment, but I wish they would have told me to just rip the bag open to get to the food. I highly advise doing that.   I really wish it would have been more to my liking, but I make some scrumptious vegan Mexican food at home, and maybe I'm just spoiled. I am glad that they have a presence in Las Vegas and I'm glad that so many people love the place. I'm all for cruelty free businesses and although it is not for me, I hope they do well.",

And every single time they bring out my food first and by the time my kids food comes I'm done! I don't know about you but no parent wants to deal with their hungry kids be upset while waiting for their food. The best part is when they actually bring my kids sides they bring NO PLATES or FORKS!!!! I'm not sure if every time they forget or assume my kids will eat from the table and use their hands. When I ask them for these simple things I always get and attitude and have to wait even longer meanwhile I finished my food 10 minuets earlier. On to the next part they always forget some sort of food item wether the fries or the soup or another side they always forget!!!!!! Also I don't understand how hard it is to get someone water cups after hey asked more than once and again the attitude. Honestly little customer service things go a loooonnnggg way!!!!!",

My husband was like \"this isn't meat?!?\" And he is a carnivore! The al pastor was tasty. The chicken was ok. Def will be going back for more asada! I wish they would open one of these in my area. Loved this place! They just need to step up their air conditioner game a little. It was pretty hot and stuffy. Oh and the green sauce is hot, even when they tell you it's mild!",

The cashier was very friendly and we received our food quickly. We went in around 11:30 am on a Wednesday. The tacos were so tasty! Best tacos I've ever had. Hands down. I had tacos al pastor and my husband got tacos de asada. We were both very satisfied with them. We will be returning very soon. When we left the cashier told us to have a nice day. Good service.

Rice and beans good, standard fair. The place was busy which is a statement in itself and I don't know how new it is but I'm guessing pretty new. Some things we wanted to order we were told they didn't have yet even though it was on the menu board and the regular menu sheets.  They definitely need some window shades.  We had to sit in the sun and were just melting from the heat. All in all I recommend this place and will take food to go so I can add my own seasoning and not sit in an oven.",

This was our first party and thanks to panchos tacos it was a huge success. Jerry from panchos is my new fave person. Their whole team went above and beyond to make my hubbys birthday special.

I will say that I was impressed by the food. I ordered the burrito with \"asada\". It was flavorful and it was a pretty big burrito.   The staff was friendly and the dine in area was clean.   I will definitely be back to try something else on the menu. The fries looked amazing so I will have to try those next.",

    "text": "Pancho's Vegan Tacos was the highlight of my Las Vegas trip!!! This food is delicious whether you are vegan or not!! I tried the posole, sopes, tostadas, and tacos. Their sopes were out of this world amazing! Everything was good, I think my least favorite thing was the chicken taco. I would come here again and again.   Ordering: Before you sit down, you order your food and then you sit and wait for your food and drink.  I follow them on instagram and see that they sometimes have tamales and pan dulce. Unfortunately they did not have pan dulce when I was there. Maybe they can open a bakery down the road, that would be amazing! Thanks Pancho's Vegan Tacos for creating great vegan food!",

They just threw up a banner on the inside. Looks like they just set up shop in 20 mins and opened. If it had just a little better appeal, it would have been a 5 start as the food and service was outstanding.",

Some of the tacos were wet and soggy, dripping with extra liquid and not in a good way. Half the liquid and they would have been way better. So I had taco juice all down my elbow when I was done with this meal. I am so happy I wore short sleeves.   We tried 4 types of tacos.   We had chik-end made of soy. This was the best of the 4 we tried. Flavor was there and it tasted super good with hot sauce!  Mushrooms tacos were wet and soggy. I've had many good mushroom dishes and this one left me wanting much much more.   The Cactus was wet and soggy. I'm not sure if that is how cactus is supposed to be. I had never had cactus before.   Asada- the 2nd best honestly it was bad for seitan. Most seitan stuff is awful imo but the tacos were ok.  Hot sauce improved all of the tacos and they needed it.  As it stands I probably will not eat here again but if you're in the area and want something vegan it is not a terrible option.   They have a few hot sauce options on the table. Hot sauce is a must with this meal.",

    "text": "This place has delicious and authentic plant-based Mexican food at an outstanding price point. They have an extensive menu of classic Mexican items such as tacos, burritos, enchiladas, tortas, huaraches, nachos, etc., and everything on the menu is made from plant-based ingredients, with no animal products used in any of their recipes. This is a great option for vegans and also for meat eaters looking to reduce the amount of animal products they consume without sacrificing on flavor. It's a unique experience for vegans to be able to dine in such an authentic Mexican restaurant.   There are many different proteins to choose from, including vegan chorizo, vegan chicken, vegan asada, and vegan al pastor, amongst others. On Tuesdays, you can get 4 of these tacos for less than 5 dollars. During the rest of the week, a 4 taco special is still reasonably priced. The tacos are a step above any vegan-friendly taco you will get at any meat-based Mexican restaurant. The proteins are well-textured and taste good, but I think they could use a bit more seasoning personally. I wasn't fully able to tell the difference between the various flavors that I tried.   The enchiladas mole came on a huge plate with 3 enchiladas plus rice and beans. The mole sauce was excellent. It is rare to find vegan mole sauce, as it usually has chicken stock in it. I was a bit disappointed in the beans, as I love refried pinto beans, but they use whole pinto beans at this restaurant instead. So many Mexican restaurants cook their refried beans with animal products, so I was looking forward to having some authentic vegan refried beans.   I ordered ice cream for dessert, but unfortunately they said they were out of their homemade vegan ice cream for the day. Instead, I ordered the strawberry cake, and was disappointed to see a label on the cake that said \"made on 11/15/2018.\" I was there on 11/20/2018, and it was not very appetizing to see that my sponge cake was made 5 days ago. As would be expected, the cake was tough and dry, and not very enjoyable except for the icing. I think they should have a better turn-around time than 5 days, especially since it was so busy inside when I went.   Panchos Vegan Tacos has a lot going for it, and I hope they continue to do well and expand their concept to other parts of the country. They were very busy the day I went there and seemed pretty stretched thin. As they adjust to their well-deserved popularity, I hope they also make sure to work out some of their inevitable kinks. I will definitely be coming back here any time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I don't really like Vegas but I'm excited for another opportunity to eat at Panchos. They have an extensive menu - all vegan! - and solid food.  I ordered the mole enchiladas with \"chicken\" and my partner had a wet burrito with their chorizo (with both sauces) + a carnitas taco. Unfortunately, they were out of chicken so the cashier recommended the asada as a replacement. They were out of a few other things, including watermelon agua fresca, which was a real bummer for me but I guess I'll get over it eventually. We were there on a Monday around 3 or 4 in the afternoon, so found it a little strange they were out of so many things - poor preparation? unusually busy over the weekend? supply issues? Not sure. The guy who ordered after us also ordered something they were out of, and like us, was informed after he placed his order because the person who took it didn't know.  They also had some classic Mexican pastries (as well as other desserts). We didn't indulge but we're from Portland and I've never seen vegan conchas here so I thought that was pretty cool.  We had a couple hours of driving ahead of us so we got our food to go and didn't get an opportunity to eat it warm but it was still reaaaaally good. The only thing we didn't like was the mole sauce, which was too chocolatey and one note. The red sauce is super spicy. The salsa verde was pretty delectable with a nice tomatillo flavor. When I ate meat, I didn't like beef so I was hesitant on the asada but enjoyed it. Everything was well seasoned. My partner thought the carnitas was the best protein he tried, and would order that on the burrito next time.  The portions were generous (my partner couldn't finish his burrito, which was honestly the size of a large baby) and the prices were super cheap. In addition to our food, we both got a drink, and the total was less than $30 even before the \"Meatless Monday\" discount. Employees were friendly.   Overall, we look forward to coming back next time we're in Vegas.",

    "text": "I had been told over and over by a coworker to check this place out so I finally decided to make it happen on my birthday. I'm SO GLAD I found this place!  FOOD: 10/10 recommend. The flavor is sooooo delicious and there is a huge variety of \"meat.\" I ordered gluten-based asada and chorizo tacos, plus a mushroom taco. It was the Tuesday Special which got you either three or four tacos + a drink. The tacos came with some type of mild salsa, sliced cucumbers, sliced radishes and lots of lime wedges. I really can't get over the flavor. Each taco actually tasted unique but also True to its \"real meat\" counterpart. I like some hot sauce and tons of lime but even without that, the tacos are mouth watering on their own. As we were walking out, we saw a burrito and they do not skimp on that... It was huge! There are also so many options on the menu. I definitely wasn't expecting that. This is a great place if you want any type of Mexican food and... it's all 100% vegan.   COST: This is a crazy good place for healthy, tasty and affordable Mexican food! They have some sort of special for every day of the week- sopas, tacos, burritos, etc. but beyond this, the regular menu prices are around $6-$10 per meal.   ATMOSPHERE: It's not necessarily a good place for groups but it's great if you're hungry and want to stop somewhere for a quick (and healthy) bite to eat that isn't a drive thru. Very laidback and chill, definitely no need to get dressed up.",

I finally went to try (3 times so far), even with my speculation of \"vegan\" Mexican food, and it did not disappoint! I've had the tacos and tostadas, which were both tasty.   My only minor con: I feel as if the flare and creativity that makes Mexican food is not all there. Maybe because of the vegan factor.  The tostadas I got were delicious however, they were a bit too overloaded, even for me; making the tostada itself difficult to pick up and went soggy too fast.   They have homemade green and red hot salsa and it's one of the best I've had! The red one is spicier than green one so watch out.   They have specials every day so just ask.   Their meat susbsitutions are great and tortillas  as well. Drinks are homemade and I love the horchata! Though beware, it sells out fast :/ Their cucumber lime water is refreshing and tasty, too.   I love the feeling of eating Mexican food without that heavy, bloated feeling you get after. So if you wanna try some delicious vegan Mexican food then come here.",

According to one of the staff, everything on the menu is vegan, even if you see the words \"cheese\" and \"sour cream.\"  I almost did not order the items I tried, but a customer in front of me assured me that everything is completely vegan.  Their Pozole tastes just like the real thing! It is a bit on the spicy side, but the texture of the vegan meat did not feel like the dish was meatless. The bowl was huge, so I had my fiance finish the rest.  I also got the grand taco, and though the sour cream looked like the real thing, my stomach did not react afterwards! I chose the chorizo vegan meat for this and the texture was just like ground meat.   I do wish the restaurant was much closer to the center of town, or that they had another location more on the West side, but it definitely is worth the drive for decent premium vegan food.",

Every time we went in, I felt like the food changed and customer service got even worse. I remember ordering over the phone asking for the mole and whoever answered laughed and kept having to ask people around her for what I was talking about. I'm fair on a lot of things but that just was humiliating because it was clearly on the menu and she just didn't know since she was new. And my fiance and I both always ate at home and about an hour or so later, never failed to get stomach aches or some type of pain. I'm not here to tear down businesses, but to really bring light to management. Fresh products should be used with less processed items. Reason why I cook everyday no longer go out for food, can't trust anyone to make food when you yourself can make it and if anything make it better.",

We picked the chickin, al pastor, and asada, hands down it tasted delicious and guilt free.  We also got the asada fries they were delicious too. We will definitely be going back. Their prices are reasonable. I hope they don't raise them!! Only thing that was a bummer was that they didn't have air conditioning only a fan in the corner of the room so the wait was a little uncomfortable. Hopefully they get one in soon because this desert heat is no joke.",

The burrito is huge, great portion and great taste. Our last plate was the Cuban torta and omg this torta was just amazing. It had a crispy bread the vegan meat was out of this world. Loved the food and I loved the service!",

The arroz con leche tasted like water and cinnamon nothing special. Their portions are huge so that's good. The place itself seems like it's going through renovation or something. I cook vegan food at home and it's not expensive to make, I feel like it's a bit overpriced.. it could be because I know how much it costs to make this type of food. The food wasn't out of this world delicious but it wasn't horrible. I feel like I should've just not been lazy and cooked at home.  Also the prices on their menus don't match what you pay for. They're more expensive by like .25. So keep an eye out for that, I noticed too late.",

It was a little difficult to find at first since my GPS led me to another place as sometimes it does. There's another vegetarian place across from where this restaurant is but I had a feeling it wasn't the one since it wasn't called Pancho's vegan tacos. Anyway, I found it and boy am I glad I did. The man at the register who I believe may be the owner, was very friendly and helpful. He asked me if it was my first time there and when I told him it was, he showed me how to order. Since today was Tuesday, he informed me that it was taco Tuesday and that I could get three tacos and a drink for $5.14 with tax. I was so excited about the price and I definitely was excited that I could get a cantaloupe drink included with my meal for that price or an extra taco. I look forward to trying many more of their menu items! In my opinion the food was tasty and filling. Maybe for the guys they should opt for the extra taco instead of the drink. I meant to ask about the ice cream that I saw advertised online that's coming. I'm not sure if they already have it or when they'll have it but I look forward to that and many more meals here.",

There were a couple people in a booth eating and two parties waiting for their takeout order. After I ordered my food one of the people waiting came up and asked why it qas taking over 30 minutes and they still hadn't got their order. The lady with the grey short hair just looked at them like she was annoyed and said I don't know I put the ticket in. and then refunded their money telling them to keep the cake they had ordered. I guess that was the least she could do but her attitude stunk, there was no apology or explanation, and the people looked confused and disappointed. Furthermore another customer walked in and walked to the sale older lady to place an order but she was chit-chatting with another employee and yelled to the back for another girl to come out and take the order so she could continue her conversation- she legit said that out loud laughing. The girl that came out to help even looked a bit embarrassed as she took the customers order. That was just plain rude. My food also took a long time to come out and I only ordered fries and two tamales- which everyone knows tamales are pre-made you just have to wrap them in foil and throw them in the bag. Again the food is great (for fast food) but the lady at the front could seriously use some customer service training.",

It's seriously so good and the food is seasoned well that if someone said it was vegan I wouldn't believe them! But the crazy part is that it is vegan! EVERYTHING! We ordered the -Chile relleno with carnitas -taco special with al pastor/carnitas  -Wednesday nacho special with carne  Presentation was displayed beautifully, so props to them for not only making it taste amazing but look amazing as well. Everyone who is vegan and not vegan needs to try this place out, PERIOD!  Also, this place is reasonably priced for being a vegan restaurant, I'm happy they made it affordable.",

We were near UNLV and decided to try this place out and it did not disappoint!  The food, I love spice and they know how to make a mean chorizo! It was incredibly spicy but my girlfriend and I absolutely loved it! We got it on the torta and wow were we amazed. If you put a meat chorizo torta and this one side by side and had me do a blind taste test.... I'd probably choose the vegan one. YES IT IS THAT GOOD! People working there are very kind make sure the food is up to par.   I got the breakfast burrito with \"carne asada\" For this one I cant say I didn't miss the actual meat because it did taste a bit odd, but its not meat so I wont complain, still had great flavor and I also got a side of the red sauce that I believe is on the chorizo and it made it amazing as well  Whether you're vegan or not come and try this place it wont disappoint!",

Upon first impression, the menu was a lot larger than I expected. Judging by the name, I expected only tacos on the menu. I was pleasantly surprised to see a whole variety of Mexican food. I settled on the green enchiladas with \"chicken\" and a small order of the classic nachos. The cashier warned me that the green enchilada sauce is spicy, so I requested it be on the side instead of on top of the enchiladas. However, when I got my food, the sauce wasn't on the side. As she said, it was quite spicy. I still enjoyed them, but I would've preferred if the sauce was actually on the side. The nachos were tasty as well. I was surprised with how generous the small order was!  Overall, my favorite part of the meal was the \"chicken.\" A lot of vegan meats have a weird taste or texture (or both), but this \"chicken\" was amazing! The taste was realistic and the texture wasn't rubbery or grainy. It was perfect.  I'm excited to return to Pancho's and try more of their menu!",

    "text": "100% vegan, authentic Mexican food. The menu is extensive, with much more than just tacos. Burritos, sopes, tamales, enchiladas, tortas, etc and fresh aguas. Most of their mock meats are made in house, which is impressive considering the variety they offer. The restaurant is casual and minimally decorated, with plenty of seating. Orders are placed at the counter in front, and are then available for dine in or takeaway.  The Al Pastor was excellent, with complex chili flavors and a subtle pineapple sweetness. My boyfriend is not vegetarian and eats \"real\" Al Pastor often, and he loved these. The Chorizo also had a wonderfully meaty texture packed with spicy cayenne and achiote pepper heat. The Asada was gross. Bland and rubbery, with a wheat gluten aftertaste. The Carnitas had a nice pulled pork texture, but lacked flavor as well. The Nopales were overcooked and slimy.   We got Cheese Nachos to share, whose sauce was reminiscent of movie theater nachos, but with a milder flavor and a starchy consistency. The Jamaica was watery and not sweet enough.  While these are not the best vegan tacos I have ever had, I appreciate that you can get a substantial plant based meal for under $10, without venturing too far from the strip.",

I wish I had ordered more street tacos but I was so thrilled I could essentially order vegan carne asada fries. On their menu, they're called Supreme fries and you can add any of the vegan proteins tomo your order. I chose the \"asada.\" I also got an \"al pastor\" street taco.   The fries are very shareable... there's a small order option as well. It's loaded with vegan protein, nacho cheese, sour cream, avocado and pico de gallo. I would have wanted bigger chunks asada \"meat\" but it was super tender and seasoned beautifully.   The street taco was delightful. The al pastor \"meat\" reminded me of adobada meat. Super flavorful and tender. Paired with the salsa verde, it is a perfect taco!  My sister in law got the albonigas served up with rice, beans and tortillas. I tasted with albonigas \"meat\"balls and my oh my! The \"meat\" melts in your mouth and the chipotle sauce it is drenched in has quite the kick of spice and flavor!  Ugh. I need more! When am I going back to Vegas? Hopefully soon!",

I ordered 3 different kinds of tacos: al pastor, chicken, and asada, all made with house-made vegan protein. My omnivore cousin ordered a chicken burrito bowl and she really liked it; I'm pretty sure this was her first vegan food experience so I'm glad we went here because it made a good impression on her. Her burrito bowl was too big for her to finish as well!  The food is tasty, portions are generous, hot sauce is perfectly spicy-hot (always a good thing as far as I'm concerned), the jamaica is excellent, the chips, guacamole, and bean dip very good, and the service was great with very friendly staff. I'm definitely going back here to eat again and would recommend it to anyone wanting good vegan Mexican food, or even a vegan cheeseburger.",

I had 4 street tacos, Asada, Al Pastor, Chik-End & Mushroom.   Since it was my 1st time I wanted a variety. The cashier brought my meal and complimented me that ordering 4 different choices was smart so I could try them. All 4 were DELISH! So yummy!   As I left, I wanted a to go menu and the sweet cashier was replaced by this mean and rude older woman and she looked at me as if I was a piece of dirt. I asked for a 2-go menu and she never looked and was extremely rude. I felt like I was in the twilight zone after initially having such a positive experience.

Their vegan cheese tastes really weird & nothing like real cheese but I've honestly never tried a vegan cheese I like so it's not their fault LOL If I were you I would just tell them to hold the cheese cause it ruins a really tasty burrito. I'll definitely be trying their impossible burger next time. Oh & I personally like this place better than Pancho's kitchen (not sure if their affiliated or not).",

Everything was delicious and even my non Vegan husband enjoyed his red and green burrito. My favorite was the chorizo sope. I also had the ceviche tostada and two carne asada tacos. The horchata wasn't too sweet and we enjoyed it very much. It will be a must stop for us from now on. Prices are low, food and serving sizes are great, the service is very friendly and welcoming. Good Job Guys!",

Was very excited to see the variety this place had in terms of different vegan dishes to serve. Ordered the Asada Nachos, tasted flavorful and light. Tried a small Quesadilla which tasted decent. Finally ordered the Asada Wet Burrito half green half red, this was surprisingly really flavorful and filling. I will say the only thing I wasn't too fond of was the ordering and paying system. Was very confused walking in as to wether I was supposed to order at the counter or if it was open seating. Waiting staff took a tad too long to finally take our order. Definitely would want to go back for round two to this great whole in the wall restaurant!  *A= Outstanding - D= Needs Improvement",

If you guys are going to be nasty to everyone you need to improve the food significantly. Prices are decent, that's about it.  Response to comment: So you always use proper write ups etc prior to disciplinary action? You treat your employees equally? You are available to discuss employee concerns or have someone delegated? You don't use manipulation and retaliation tactics in place of normal management policies?  Because if that's True the communication I saw was fabricated and I apologize for that portion.   That said...Quality and ethical values have definitely gone down, I have been a customer since you opened and it's noticeable.  It seems like the whole place is going down hill. A defensive, snarky response to honest feedback isn't necessary.",

Something about chips and salsa before, and then meat, cheese, lots of fried tortillas, heavy sauces, rice and beans (and maybe tequila) hits me pretty hard physically and after a meal I have to recover.  It's like my systems have to shut down to process all the carbs, grease, and meat.    This restaurant has delicious, wonderful food, and after you eat it you still feel really good.    I have always mistrusted the traditional ceviche, where the cooks claim that the fish is \"cooked\" by the citrus that is added.  That does nothing to kill the microbes that are in the fish.  Panchos has provided an excellent ceviche that I don't have to be scared to eat because it's plant based.    The potato tacos are so good.  I still have a lot of things I want to try on the menu.",

Wish I could have gotten the arroz con leche because it's my favorite but they said it's made with almond milk, no can do with the nut milk:( vegan and not being able to do almond milk sucks!

Which I understand paying full price for, except I was getting a quesadilla with none of the crazy stuff inside it. I was getting a tortilla and cheese only. Most of the restaurants we go to will make an exception on this. Even whole foods charges way cheaper for a plain cheese quesadilla. Sorry for the little rant there. I'll still go to this place, but this quesadilla issue does effect our judgement when we're deciding where to eat. But still an awesome place for Vegan food",

I wouldn't suggest it to anyone enthusiastically but I might mention as a means to get access to fast/cheap/easy food. Ordering on Grubhub or any online platform can be of frustration because it's not uncommon for them to get the orders mixed up or to leave some things out. For example last time I ordered a combo and I only received the main item, without the sides. Now that's of annoyance. I personally haven't tried all of their items, but like I said it's average food. Something you can easily whip up at home. The rice is probably one of the worst things that they serve, it's mushy and bland. The pinto beans are also a joke. They lack love and flavor. The mole enchiladas, potato tacos, street tacos, and tamales are great though. If they enhanced certain items, they would most likely be able to drive in more clientele and I wouldn't hesitate stopping in more frequently myself.",

My mother being Mexican cooks 100% authentic Mexican food but of course it wasn't vegan so she was curious to try it out! We decided to go this past Wednesday and walked in not knowing what to expect! The man that was behind the counter was very friendly and explained all the food to us, we don't know if he is the owner or employee but he was very nice! The place was pretty busy taking orders for dine-in and orders to go! We decided to try the pozole with nopales, the sope with asada and the three tacos special, one with asada, al pastor and chicken! Everything was so good and had flavor!! I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu",

Not a bad idea, but you also have to go upfront if you wish to have any refills. The food was great! with a large party I understand how hard it is to get the food out all at once, but we waited a good 20 minutes before the last person received her food. the bathroom were dirty, as was our silverware.

Everything was so amazing that when we took a bite we kept saying \"mmm.\" It's not too far from the strip and the prices are decent. Definitely coming back next time we're in town.

When I went in, the lady was SO sweet like seriously she seems like a genuinely nice person. When I saw the menu I was so overwhelmed because everything looked so delicious!! My dad loves authentic mexican food and we used to eat it a lot a veryyy long time ago. I was very excited to see that the menu looked just as authentic as a non-vegan restaurants. I ended up ordering asada tacos with a side of rice and beans because that was what I used to order. It was SO DELICIOUS like wow!!!! Seriously I couldn't eat enough!!!!!

Now I know this is not something you should be doing to Mexican food, and I agree, but they somehow pulled it off. The carne asada and al pastor tacos tastes very similar to the real thing.

This is one of those times when a vegan place doesn't price gauge you because it's \"vegan\".  These guys give you amazing food and a fantastic price!   I would say the ordering / food delivery system is a bit wonky but I have to believe they are just working out the kinks.  I am not taking any stars off because what you get in terms of food/value makes up for it IMHO",

    "text": "Wow, just wow. As a lifelong Mexican food eater from San Diego and full-blown anti-veg carnivore up until a few years ago, I can say that this place delivers like no other. It is real Mexican food--spot-on \"meats\" and sauces and sour cream--but 100% plants. The location, ambience, menu, and service is authentic hidden gem, strip-mall Mexican food, yet, dare I say it again, made from plants.  I sampled the potato rolled tacos (crispy and satisfying--I could have eaten 5), \"cheese\" and jalapeno tamale (very good without being dry), the \"beef\" tamale (also good, though I think I liked the jalapeno better because I like the little kick), and the wet burrito with both the red and green sauces (HUGE burrito with crumbled beef that is so \"real,\" you'll be truly concerned that a mistake was made). I liked the green sauce a little more, but both sauces were perfect and I asked for another serving. I would legitimately buy those sauces and put them on everything.  My man sampled my plates and also had the \"chicken\" burrito--loved it all, couldn't believe the serving sizes, loved the sauces, and walked out stunned that we got our \"dirty Mexican food\" vegan style. \"How did they make the rice vegan!? What sour cream is that!? Can you believe the menu!? Can we go back tomorrow!? That wasn't greasy and I don't feel gross--how is this happening!?\" He's an Alberto's (Filibertos, etc.) guy and felt like, for the first time in around 6 years, that he got \"his food\" without compromising a thing. The boy was practically dancing in the streets.   No way that anyone will think the food is vegan--everyone will like it. Flavorful, filling, messy, crunchy, saucy, awesome Mexican food without consuming/harming/using an animal. Just wow.",

Their supreme fries with chickn are amazing!!  The reason why i'm docking this place two stars is because of two things: things always being out of stock and of the current state it is in. They're always out of drinks or tamales every time I go in and I don't understand why. It also just doesn't look very well maintained. I do understand that they are expanding but the restaurant is just so messy & underkept. It does not feel very comfortable eating here at the moment so I'm really hoping that after the expansion project it'll be different.. I feel like with the right effort & maintenance this place could be amazing.",

Let's be real! I would never order Vegan tacos on my own. But I have an employee who is vegan and offered me a street taco from a \"yummy Mexican vegan place!\" I was starving so I did not deny her offer! She made an order off of Grubhub and 45 minutes later heaven came to our work in the form of a street taco! The aroma alone was satisfying! We unwrapped the little package of goodness and it blew my mind! Not only did these street tacos look like real chorizo tacos, but the smelt Devine!!   Slowly I bit into perfection! Immediately I was hooked. The trees are actually tasted like chorizo and the red salsa made it a little bit spicy and warm when chewing! It was the perfect combination of textures and flavors. I literally wasn't expecting a flavor explosion in my mouth. I then literally devoured all for street tacos without sharing with her! Oops! I really didn't feel bad. Since that Vegan taco relationship defining moment Pancho's Vegan Tacos and I have been going steady for about 1 month!!!   I've tried the tacquitos, street tacos, beans, rice, horchata, and carne Asada fries! All perfection!! It's a must try!!",

I am obviously not the only one who has experienced bad customer service as the owner of a few successful businesses here's some advice. If you plan on making this a successful business which you can grow and keep going for the long run notice you have a problem and fix it. I'll be here to tell you that your clientele deserves great customer service. You are seriously surrounded by Mexican places around you yeah you offer vegan options which is great but your service is really bad. Other vegan places are opening around town identical to your food and quality it's not long until another one is open down the street.

About 2 months ago I visited the wrong Pancho's restaurant, with the intention to eat here ( I finally got to try it !) OMFG! Huge portions, delicious food and man that Horchata ! We ordered the pastor fries (the plate was huge and I can't even explain how delicious). We also got the mole enchiladas and wet chicken burrito. Although I'm coming from LA area, I will always stop by here while at Vegas. My carnivore family also ate and loved it ! Plenty of parking, customer restroom available and plenty of tables inside to dine in.",

I've been spoiled by the best vegan asada on the planet so I may be a but biased. I wanted to give them 4 stars but they only deserve 3.5 on the strength of the nopales and the chile relleno alone. The tamale wasn't exciting the salsas were lacking and the red sauce on the wet burrito couldn't even salvage the lack of flavor. The prices are good though and having vegan food is important but they need to up their game in the worst way.",

I'm also not sure if the AC was working or if they were just keeping it that hot to save on electricity. We picked the seat In front of the fan which kept us pretty cool. I definitely recommend trying the chicken over the asada. If you're searching for that chared taste the chicken seems to have it more then the asada. I also recommend the sopes as that was what everyone in my family favored over their own choices that they had made. The beverage selection is rather limited. The food tasted ok, not the best but the amount was defiantly more than filling.",

To drink I prefer horchata obviously since I'm Mexican and, watermelon, & cucumber yum yum yum!!! Totally worth the price and I honestly love how the owner is hands on into this amazing business he created shows his humbleness.

    "text": "UPDATE 3/9/18: this is by no means anything against the food, the food here is pretty good. The customer service from this company specially today was very poor! I was informed they were on dirty dining and because I made a comment on one of their Facebook post they felt the need to send me a private message being extremely defensive. After I readdressed this via their public post they continued to argue with me through their social media account. I just don't think that's something you do to a customer.... specially when the vegan community here in Las Vegas is very tight-knit.... not sure on how I feel about this, it's tough when you enjoy the food of a place but the service is not up to par.....  So I was surprised to see that a place would actually have authentic vegan tacos. The location of this place was a bit confusing but it's located by the Tropicana Cinema. The prices are very affordable there's a lot of choices with drink combos too. I stuck to the single authentic style tacos these are made out of seitan. I used to be a meat eater and tacos were some of three foods I missed the more THESE TACOS ARE SOOO GOOD you cannot tell the difference from real meat. My favorite would have to be the \"chorizo\" and the \"alpastor\". I also had he orchata but this was regular not too sweet. Definitely recommend this place it is very good!",

The asada and al pastor brought back reminiscences of home made Mexican food when I used to eat at my friend Oscar's mom's house. Highly recommend to others to try this. Price is reasonable and people are friendly.",

I remember the first time going here which was about a year ago now and i was very skeptical at the time of whether vegan Mexican food would fulfill the same cravings I have for regular Mexican food. Needless to say, I was hooked from the beginning. The food is amazing! I try to come here almost every week now because of how committed I am to this place. I've watched it grow so much as well and their renovations are such a nice touch to the overall feeling. My usual order is Supreme fries, but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. They've even recently released Vegan ice cream that I still need to try! Pancho's Vegan Tacos is definitely a place you want to visit.",

Panchos Kitchen is much better and they have vegan/vegetarian options as well.",

The last time we ordered to go the shorted us a half dozen tamales. I called and a gentleman very casually told me to go the next day and they would give them to him, but didn't take my name or provide me with his when I asked. Tonight we ordered and decided on take out (they were closing) and of course the sope with sour cream I ordered was missing the sour cream. I did check this time to make sure everything was in the bag that we ordered having learned my lesson from previous takeout errors, but did not open the contents of each container to make sure all ingredients were present. Panchos you have a good thing going, don't mess it up due to your lack of attention to detail....",

I will for sure be returning to this location and restaurant   Brother is a hardcore foodie (meat eater)  Stated \" if you brought me the el pastor tacos and didn't tell me they were vegan I wouldn't be able to tell the difference they are so good\"",

I want nothing more than to throw my money at them and support a vegan business. But the food has been consistently horrible 100% of the time. Cmon guys it's not hard to put a bit of effort and season your food. The nacho cheese is a joke. Throw a bit of chipotle powder on it and bam! It no longer tastes like bland yellow water. The fries... they shouldn't be see-through! Just leave those suckers in the fryer for a bit longer and you'll notice magic happen. And the tamales... any Hispanic person knows to reheat tamales by steaming them. Your team should be embarrassed for nuking tamales and giving them to customers. I don't even want to start on the soaking soggy bland tacos. As a vegan Hispanic, this is so disappointing. Take some pride in your product and put some flavor and effort! I'll never go back, but I hope you guys get your sh*t together and succeed.",

I ordered the \"Tuesday\" special three asada tacos, three fried rolled potato tacos, and two tamales for approximately $15.00. With the exception of the tamales everything else is totally worth returning for! The seasoning was on point, and each dish taste uniquely different as it should (unlike some of the other competitors). The presentation of my to-go order was simple yet impressive. It was refreshing not to see any oil or grease in my containers.   Useful Tip: Utilize the menu before ordering at the counter.   The cashier was pretty intimidating he just stood their asking is that it repetitively. If your seeking an vibrant, down to earth vibe from management this might not be your place aside from that the food is terrific and 100 percent worth returning for!!",

Come get your grub on. Something for everyone. Favorite is those street style tacos. Oh and you can get the special with three tacos and a drink or sub the drink for a 4th taco! Whaaa!?!?",

Workers were serving other customers and didn't even say hello to me.  So after 5 min standing at the counter and 5 min sitting in the dining room it was apparent this was an attempt in futility.  I did get a good look at the menu though.   It really irks me though I drove across town just to hit this spot as it's vegan and it was a waste of time, gas and energy.  So disappointed as I really wanted this to be good. I left irritated, and hungry.  I'll make the 30 min drive back home and make my own dang tacos.",

Ally (vegan): I ordered the South Mexican Sopes with mushrooms and a Red Tamale. We also shared a cucumber aqua Fresca that was not our thing. If you're looking for a drink with little sugar and is really refreshing, then it's worth a try.   The service was good, the staff were prompt in bringing our food and kind to us. The restaurant's interior was clean and had relatively authentic Hispanic feel compared to a place like Cafe Rio. The prices are fair for a college student, and the portion sizes are pretty big!",

I'd like to think a vegan restaurant would offer better quality ingredients by they really miss the mark.   Everything outside of the faux meat is flavorless, and occasionally I'd like to have a menu item I can enjoy just as much without faux meat on it. Not happening here.  The fake avocado sauce/guacamole stuff smells like silly putty or something and the cheese is terrible. They also used a ridiculous amount of onions, it's an onion party.  It's frustrating because there is so much potential here but it's just been a flavorless, avocadoless, overhyped disappointment.",

    "text": "OK,  So I was checking this place out for the daughter as she is a Vegan and this is near my office.  I finally came here for lunch!  1. Location - You are gonna have a hard time finding this as it is tucked into a strip mall that is somewhat discombobulated in terms of access and all the different stores.  This is the location where there is a Dunkin Donut, 7/11 and a Tropicana Theater that has older released movies for cheap.  If you go at lunch, it can be hard to park.  2. The Restaurant - Interesting Decor, built for efficiency more than modernism.  Not a negative, and really it is just okay, but boy is it very efficient.  Order food, sit and wait and you can see them processing the food or you can dine in on the dining room side that has a few tables . The restaurant was quite busy during lunch.  3. The food - Yes, I love mushrooms so I had a classic  burrito with mushrooms.  It was so good and I love the two sauces that they give you. I used them both.  The rice, beans are perfect and with the mushrooms, you cannot beat the taste.  I was about to order another one for dinner it was so good.  They offer four choices of vegan meat, a gluten based Asasa/Al Pastor / Chorizo, Mushrooms, Soy based meat or cactus.  I haven't tried the cactus yet, but if it is like a jack fruit, that should be good.   Next on my list will be Soft Street Tacos, Tomales and I cannot wait to try the Posole.  I am glad I will be going back to this place.   GK says check it out.",

It's somewhat refreshing for me personally... reminds me of my small hometown family owned businesses/restaurants... shout to the east coast. The real disappointment was the \"guacamole\" and chips. Really only avocado smashed up a little with a small hint of lime. Definitely would never order that again.",

Vegan food can be expensive from time to time but not here.  I came in on taco Tuesday to find that 3 tacos and a drink is $4.25. How is that possible. It's like the best deal in town. I ordered a round wii my buddy and ended up getting up to order another round.  The owner it looked like, was very gracious when I complimented the food.   If you want a awesome taco Tuesday deal, or great vegan Mexican food please come to panchos. I promise you'll love it. Did I mention my buddy isn't vegan and asked to go back next Tuesday ;)",

Great posole, rolled potato tacos.  Very helpful cheerfull staff, even the owner was sitting down.  Will definitely be back Many more times to this amazing completely vegan Mexican restaurant !  Went back next day to entertain some family, and the food just seemed disappointing... it's incredibly incredibly Bland, no seasoning, no depth, as a chef by profession these are things I look for.. when you ask for salt they give you little tiny packets and to season your food properly you're gonna need at least 8... all growing pain issues that can be fixed to make the place successful. Food inconsistent at the same time two days in a row .. wish the best though and hope they work these issues out and succeed.",

I got the Tofu Scramble Burrito, Chick-end Sopes, Cheese Chili Rellenos, Al Pastor Posole, & the 3 Enchiladas (Nopales, Asada, Chick-end) with rice & beans. Everything was well seasoned & they use Follow Your Heart cheese so the creamy melted Relleno was delicious. Their sauces are so good, especially the reddish orange one which has the perfect amount of spicy. The breakfast burrito was my favorite, well flavored, lots of avocado & a quality tortilla... there wasn't anything that I didn't like. The posole broth was delicious & perfect for the congestion I had going on. I'm looking forward to going back. It's a very friendly place with amazing customer service.",

    "text": "\"Updating\" as a reply for the owner.   Firstly: I never said nor stated I am strictly vegan. NOT being vegan however, doesn't diminish nor make my inquiries any less valid. My personal dietary restrictions don't take away my concerns for what is in your food that I am PAYING for and putting in my body. I'm flattered you dug through my other reviews though.   Secondly: How are you going to dispute ME on what YOUR employee SAID TO ME - To go and visit the taco shop around there. Because yes, he also is NOT vegan (like I told him I wasn't!)and eats at the taco shop when he doesn't want to eat where he works. Obviously you weren't there because if you were I would have received all this information on the spot. Which leads us to  My third point: I appreciate you giving us information about the food (now). The problem you STILL FAIL to realize AND address, is that NOWHERE on your website, or menus can we have the knowledge of (and verify) ingredients and the sources. You said it yourself!! All those other places are frozen , pre-made etc. So we're suppose to just now take your word on the basis that you \"exposed\" other establishments? That's what I meant when I said you have a responsibility as a VEGAN establishment to provide this information TRANSPARENTLY and have it READILY available to support your claim. It's nowhere to be found. If you don't understand what I am asking for with \"What are your ingredients for your all your vegan protein?\" I cant help you. That is as clear as I can make it. This IS about Panchos, not any other place.   Fourth: To be fair here. I read a couple of reviews BEFORE writing mine because I said to myself  \"Am I? Am I the only one who thinks this way?\" And no! I am not alone. Read some four star reviews, even five star reviews and you'll see where I get what I am saying in my review. Your customer base (not all) says your establishment is out of items constantly, the drink selection is minuscule to bare minimum and I got the \"hole in the wall\" reference from another two reviews. I was not the first one. So maybe even if reviews give you four or five stars, you should read them. Or don't. It's your business.   Lastly: This is very audacious of you.   \"Simply for the fact that we are 100% vegan, non-gmo and low sodium... your life just got healthier.\"  Why cause  low sodium? Just because you believe that less sodium is good for you shows me how uninformed you personally really are. The scientific community has never come to consensus  that less sodium is best for everyone. Low sodium IS better when you've overloaded your system with it or if you have an intolerance to it. I am not in need of low sodium or non-gmo. I am in need of less calories. Which is what most of your dishes are NOT. Based on what I was served (NOT HOW MUCH I ATE) alone, it contained all my calories for one 24 hour period... a detriment to MY diet. Why would you think eating out at your establishment is making MY life healthier? How do you know I'm not having a cheat meal at your restaurant? Healthy = is a dish with protein equivalent to fats and carbs OR high volume (A LOT OF FOOD) but low fat/low carb. Again, something the dishes served here aren't.   'When people say that Pancho's Vegan Tacos is a \"fast food\" place.. makes me wonder.'   Wonder no more. I just answered it for you.  If I ate here everyday I would become morbidly obese. It doesnt fit the healthy profile based on the proportions of carbs/protein or volume/carbs to MAINTAIN a healthy lifestyle. Personally, I maintain a strict diet so that I can eat out often. Unfortunately, I cant do that here.  I will check out your new location once it opens and the old one closes, maybe you'll have the nutrition facts and I will surely update my review then.",

The woman who served our food, seems to be the manager or something, was extremely rude. She dropped our food and started walking away in the middle of me asking her for something. She then proceeded to yell to me from across the dining area because she couldn't be bothered to listen when I was addressing her. Then, while beginning to eat my nachos, I realize that they forgot my \"meat\" and had to again go up and ask for something else. My husband got the supreme fries, aka cold fries drowned in toppings.   Overall, I am HIGHLY disappointed waisting a 30 min drive to go to a place that couldn't care less about customer service at all. This will be my last visit to this establishment. Too much competition in Las Vegas to treat your customers like crap.   Oh, and you have to give tip before receiving their raving services so beware.",

You order at a makeshift counter with a girl that has an iPad and doesn't know the answers to basic menu questions.   It's unorganized. You don't get a number but the food runner comes out and yells your name to find you. No water. The food was bland and cold and came out incorrect. All the different \"meats\" appear to be the same even though I ordered three different kinds of tacos. Don't understand what the hype is about. As a vegan I would hope that any non vegans that come here don't get deterred by the food. The only plus is that they use biodegradable \"plastic\" bags.",

Most often, Vegan restaurant management is tuned into common food issues such as Gluten and Soy allergies and avoiding the GMO tell-tale High Fructose Corn Syrup by using Cane Sugar.   This is not the case with Panchos. They have no Gluten Free options nor do they have any Meat Substitutes that are not Soy-based. If you are seeking Gluten-free or Soy-free, you will not find it at Panchos as of late May 2017.  While this may be no huge deal, there is a deal breaker for me. Panchos Vegan Tacos, a \"MEXICAN RESTAURANT FOR VEGANS,\" DOES NOT OFFER GUACAMOLE. SRLSY. Yes, you read that correctly, a Vegan Taco Shop that does not offer Guacamole. Isn't this like reverse cultural appropriation or something, the withholding of the best part of their culture?  Now, if you had Panchos Carnivorous Currascaria maybe you could get away with it, because maybe Brazilians don't appreciate guac for the elixir of life that it is. But a taco shop without guac is like an airplane without  wings, a politician without lies, or a Filipino doctor on United Airlines, it just doesn't fly.  I see a new ad with a tostada that appears to have green goodness on it. Or at least it appears green, so maybe they took the feedback to heart and adjusted with the market, and if that becomes the case before I find out and update this review, then good on 'em for evolving their business. I intend to stop by in a few months when I'm out and about and hungry and have cash to eat out and see. 'Cause if there's guac I'll stay and eat the Soy and Gluten, nom nom, for I'm just a Laco-Ovo Vegetarian looking for a yummy Taco that has Guac!",

It was really busy so the owner seemed stressed so his customer service wasn't great. Actually really rude and snappy. I would return for the food but hope he's not there or in a better mood next time. For this reason I can't give all 5 stars.",

I'm not vegan but my friend is and I picked the place mainly because it was close to where we were. What a great experience. My only ding was that my food came out almost five minutes before my friends did. I did not think this was enough to take a star away since the place was truly amazing.",

One of the best Mexican Vegan places that I have been to.  There is something on the menu for everyone.  The have a great choice of \"meats\".  Their version of carne asada was delicious.  The salsas are amazing.  The service is fast and friendly.  I've tried the pozole, burritos, tacos, sope and tostadas on my various visits.  I have not been disappointed once.  I don't always eat soy meats, so this place is a nice treat to my usual vegan diet.  I am glad to have found this spot and will continue to visit whenever I am in Las Vegas.",

I've had the burrito plate as well as the street tacos and their horchata. As someone who has been plant based diet for a year it's great knowing there's restaurants like Pancho's where you can still get the food you know and love. The entire establishment is very clean and bathrooms are very well kept. Can't wait to try the vegan ice cream they're adding to the menu and on the weekend they serve vegan donuts from a local vegan donut place. Look forward to coming back and trying more delicious food.",

    "text": "I first tried Pancho's after numerous co-workers swore up and down about how delicious this vegan food is. As I just recently started cutting meat/animal products out of my diet i figured I'd give Pancho's a try. I ordered an Asada burrito to go. Holy smokes!  The burritos are not only huge but tasty as well. I ended up having 1/2 for lunch and finished the other 1/2 for dinner.  My next visit I ordered the dorrados (potato tacos) with rice and beans. Everything was seasoned and full of flavor. Definitely a yummy choice. My subsequent visits resulted in orders of Pastor nachos with nacho cheese instead of shredded, and asada street tacos. Everything I've ordered has been delicious and I definitely don't feel like I'm missing out on not having meat.  Since the recent expansion and addition of a second register, ordering to go has been so easy. In fact maybe too easy as I've been to Pancho's 7? times in the last month and a half and today was recognized by the guy who normally runs the register.  I think I've become a regular...lol. It's conveniently located down the street from my workplace and so easy to pick up lunch when I've forgotten to bring mine from home.",
