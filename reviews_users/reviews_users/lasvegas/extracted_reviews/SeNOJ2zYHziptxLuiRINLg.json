Will make a reservation next time so we have a view of the fountains. Great spot.",

I especially enjoyed the malloreddos pasta.  What was crazy was that the next day, a version of the dish was being served at the Bellagio buffet!  That did not stop me from eating it again.

Food is Italian served tapas style.  Basically, small portions.  I did not leave hungry.  It is a lot of money for a small portion.  In spite of that, I did not think my overall bill was unreasonable.   Everything was great and had its own flavor.    The meatballs were probably the favorite thing I ordered.   You can get away with 2-3 of the tapas size dishes per person depending how hungry you are and I suggest sharing.   The staff was great and did not rush.",

    "text": "Out of all the restaurants on the Strip, Lago is my personal favorite. It's located right behind the Fountains of Bellagio and it has a gigantic glass wall so you can see the water show while dining. It gets especially beautiful at night when all the lights of the Strip reflect on the lake and the water glistens and you can see Paris and Planet Hollywood in the background. The interior decor is very modern and clean, chairs are comfortable, and it has a vibe that, to me, is different from other Strip restaurants.  I haven't tried all their dishes (most are small plates that are shareable with 2 people), but the ones I have tried so far are the pork ribs, mushroom risotto, shrimp-stuffed squid, and sea bass (catch of the day). All were small plated except for the sea bass. The pork ribs are fantastic when eaten hot, same for the risotto. The squid was cooked perfectly but the  flavors were just okay compared to the pork and risotto. The sea bass was a bit bland, and the garnish (something along the lines of a ratatouille) didn't seem to mesh well with the flavors of the fish. But that's just my personal opinion, and none of the food was actually bad. The overall dining experience was perfect, and I'll definitely be coming back for a 4th time on my next trip.",

The Greatest thing about the restaurant was the views from the outside patio area. We came at night and requested to sit outside, which the very graciously accommodated. Although the scorching hot out, it was worth it. We got the best view of the Bellagio fountain show, all while enjoying some drinks and a wonderful meal.  The ambiance was spectacular. My only qualm was although the service was good I didn't feel like our server was very engaging and didn't seem to be happy to be there at all. But hey everyone has a bad day at work sometimes, so I guess no big deal.   The food was excellent. To be honest this is Vegas so we were a little drunk by the time we even got to the restaurant. So my memory is hazy on the exact dishes. Lol. But I know I had a sea food risotto that was fantastic. Everything else we tried was really good. And the drinks were great too. Will positively come back when in Vegas again",

Each of the items are meant to be shared - we each had a salad and split a selection of ribs, sausage pizza, lamb chops, and basal pesto pasta with a couple of vegetables.  Each was very good but the lamb chops and pasta were outstanding.  Great and attentive service, with a nice view of the fountains while they were doing their display.  Pricing was reasonable on a per plate basis for Strip comparisons, and with one cocktail and a glass of wine the ticket was right at $200.  If you are staying at or near the Bellagio, I would recommend you to give this place a try.",

And the dining experience was just as spectacular the second time around.  Once again we were seated on the restaurant patio, with an exceptional view of the dancing Bellagio Fountains and Paris' Eiffel Tower just across the way.  Service was impeccable from our omnipresent server Denise, and the food we ordered was sublime.  My party shared several small plates.  I began with fresh complimentary Cranberry Buns, a hot bowl of Pasta Fagioli e Cozze with PEI Mussels and Tubetti Pasta, a high heap of delightful Salumi and Flatbread, and Cesare Salad with Baby Romaine, a Ciabatta Crouton, and a delicate Caesar Anchovy Dressing.  Tonno Crudo was ultra-fresh, and a Honey Bun adorned with Alla Ricotta e Mile sweet and enjoyable.  Salumi was fresh, nicely varied, and a fine starter.  More substantial fare included tasty Striped Bass Entero, yummy Cannelloni, excellent plump Gamberi, delicious Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles, and juicy Filet Mignon cooked medium and served with delectable Roasted Potatoes.    For dessert we enjoyed delicate Tiramisu, Chocolate Hazelnut Mattonella, refreshing Chocolate Gelato, and for me great Decaf.  This was a great super-fine meal, and the excellent consistency in food, service, and ambiance between the two outings was noteworthy.  There is ample reason why acclaimed chef Julian Serrano's newest gem of a restaurant is currently one of the hottest dining spots in Las Vegas.",

That's one of the perks of being Yelp Elite/Yelp Gold Elite status. Thats the same thing IMO when you have a  Food critic and /or food blogger coming  in for a meal and at the end, a bill is not presented? A free meal is a free meal any which way you look at it, and who doesn't love free???  Like the saying goes, \"Don't hate the playa, hate the game! LMAO!!! SMH.....  ANYWHO.....  Chef Julian Serrano and his team take your tastebuds on a culinary voyage through the regions of Italy providing you with a plethora of small plates(and they are small!) which are meant for sharing, and so that you may experience a variety of bites too. They suggest about 3-4 plates per person, but of course, you be the judge of your appetite! Our  view overlooking the fountains added a nice romantic tough as well. If you plan to dine here, the outdoor patio is where its at.  We went straight for the jugular and ordered up the OSSO BUCCO and SQUID INK GARGANELLI WITH LOBSTER which were good(both were a bit bland, especially the lobster and polenta), but even better IMHO are the LAMB CHOPS and 7&7 LOBSTER KNUCKLES AND POTATO GNOCCHI. Another overlooked dish that is a must order is the QUAIL SALTIMBOCA. The MARGHERITA PIZZA is fit for a 4 or 5 year old, and dishes worth repeating are the SCALLOP PUTTANESCA, RISOTTO WITH TRIPE,. MUSHROOMS, AND MINT(better this time than at the Yelp event), and my favorite, the GRILLED OCTOPUS WITH SQUID INK COUSCOUS. Dessert wise, the PANNA COTTA, BIANCOMONGIARE and TIRAMISU were a great end to our meal.  We received spectacular service from start to finish which made up for the minimal hiccups on the food. Dine outdoors for the awesome view and savor each and every bite! ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4",

For drinks, I recommend trying the Lago, which is a strawberry drink that comes with an ice sphere and gold flakes. It's delicious and gorgeous at the same time!  Service was also very good - they sat us in the patio facing the water, and they let us sit there as long as we wanted, did not rush us, and brought out a lovely dessert after finding out it was one of our birthdays!

I was able to get any drink from the menu put in there. It's about 3 drinks worth in one cup, deal! The rosso bellini was light and refreshing. The raspberry wasn't overpowering. The bartender was attentive and courteous throughout our time there.",

    "text": "THAT VIEW DOE. The Bellagio fountain show with the Eiffel Tower in the background - how romantic is that? Of course, I came here with my significant other for his birthday. I made the reservation on Open Table just a couple weeks before, and luckily, I was able to get a 6:30pm reservation. At first, I was a little bummed cause I wanted a later dinner, but this was actually the perfect time to go! We got seated by the window and got to see the fountain show both in the daytime and nighttime! The music was difficult to hear inside the restaurant though. I wish they turned it up a little, at least during the show, since the music really enhances experience. But I've seen the fountain show plenty of times before, and this was the best view I've had! Anyway, onto the food. They have plenty of dishes to choose from, and it's a small plates style, so you can try out several different dishes without filling your stomach too quickly. We ordered 9 different plates - some were average, others were good, and others were absolutely yummy. My favorite plates were the 7&7 and calamaro ripieno! They also brought us tasty cannolis for dessert, which was complimentary since it was my boyfriend's birthday! Overall, a great dining experience with a beautiful view!",

It was fairly new at the time, but I didn't find the food particularly memorable, in fact when I looked back at the pictures I had taken, I barely remembered that my friend and I had split a pizza.   We had the scallop appetizer, a margherita pizza, seafood risotto, and spaghetti chittara. While everything tasted good, it wasn't \"wow,\" and I felt no urge to go back. I know it's the Bellagio, so it's going to be overpriced, but to me the food wasn't worth the price. The view was something impressive though. I finally saw the fountain show for the first time, and up close too since the restaurant borders the \"lake.\"",

Amazing ingredients and execution, so so delicious, light and clean tasting, and it literally made me feel like I was dining in the Mediterranean. Drinks were fantastic and perfectly balanced, and service was superb. And can't beat sitting by the Bellagio fountains. The fountains were being cleaned when we were there, but the water still had such a calming effect. Just beautiful. Can't wait to come back and I'm sad this wonderful lunch is over. It'll definitely be one I remember.  Wagyu carpaccio: so good. A little thicker cut than regular carpaccio, which is nice because the beef is so exceptional. Fresh, crisp, sharp arugula to bring out the flavors and literally the best Parmesan reggiano I have ever tasted. Topped with a drizzle of lemon sauce that perfected the whole thing.  Scallop crudo: the best scallop dish I've ever had. Ever. Delicate, fresh, perfect combination of flavors, and left a taste in my mouth that I didn't want to go away.  Rigatoni with lamb ragu: perfectly cooked pasta, delicious and not as heavy as you would expect a lamb ragu to be.  Branzino: skin could've been a LITTLE crisper but it was so so good anyway. Authentically Mediterranean.  Veal piccata: amazing. Just amazing. We literally were scraping the leftover sauce off the bottom of the plate at the end. Maybe the best veal piccata I've had too. Probably is.  Cannoli: SOOOOOOO GOOOD!!! I want more!!!  Amalfi dessert: also really yummy. The merengue was perfectly prepared and the flavored were lemony and amazing. Definitely recommend.  Try this place. You'll love it.",

Trust me, everything was excellent (including the view), but for being touted as this amazing place, it didn't have that spark, that pop that I was looking for.  Yes, all of the food was fantastic and I'd totally come back, but it didn't have the... I don't know, innovation that I had when I was dining at, say, Jaleo.  Still, I'd definitely recommend Lago to people, especially those who love Italian food and want a good view of the Bellagio fountains.",

We ended up waiting a bit on our reservation so they could fit us in for a fountain view table. They sat us as soon as they could at a four top, jut the two of us. Before we got too settled in, I think we had just ordered drinks, a manager asked us if we would mind at all moving one table over to a two top. We had already offered the other two spots at our table to a nice couple we met while waiting. We didn't mind at all. They brought a complimentary bottle of champagne for the trouble.   Dinner was very good. We each got a salad and a pasta dish. Flavorful, good sized portions. We shared as well.   Desert was very good. I don't remember the name but it was delicious. My fiance picked it out so of course it was chocolate. It did have hazelnuts.  The bill was very reasonable considering the quality and location.

We asked him for a pic and he turned us down at the time and promised to do it before we left. He never offered and we had to remind him when the check came. But by that time, it was dark and the restaurant was crowded so we didn't get a good picture. Sad since we were in town to celebrate a big milestone birthday, which our waiter was aware of.  As for the food, only 3 out of the 5 dishes were good. Don't bother with the oysters (from Washington State; really muddy and tasteless) or seafood. Stick with the pasta dishes. Veal gnocchi was delicious. They also brought our drinks to us late...after we were done with our second dish. Someone else also mentioned that they pushed the food on them pretty fast.

    "text": "The view was excellent...but that's it.  Not worth the money.  I was here on a recent Saturday night with a group of 6 other people.  The troubles began right away.  We arrived at 9:00 for our 9:00 reservation.  A couple of guys were a couple of minutes late due to having to walk over from the Bellagio. The restaurant told us to let them know when the rest of the group arrived. That's fine, I understand the desire to not seat incomplete parties.   We took a seat in the bar area. BUT, by 9:06 everyone had arrived and we let them know.  Despite that, they didn't seat us until 9:30.  No apologies, no acknowledgement at all that they had botched things.  However, it could have been worse. There was another group of about 10 people that had apparently been waiting 90 minutes beyond their reservation time.  Once we sat down, the service was slooooooooow. They may have just been understaffed, I couldn't tell. But, regardless, it took forever for our waitress to take our order. It then took a long time for the food to come out, and when it did there were some mixups with the orders.  I could look past the service problems if the food was truly excellent...but it wasn't. The food was overpriced for the quality and the alcohol was absurdly expensive. $18 for a small mojito?! Really?  That being said, the cocktail was the best thing about the meal for me, but several of my friends had their drink orders screwed up (who serves a martini on the rocks in a small tumbler, honestly?).  I had mushroom risotto where the rice was significantly undercooked and the flavors were underwhelming.  I followed that up with a braised duck on top of polenta.  It was ok, but I don't feel like it was anything I couldn't have gotten at Carabba's for half the price.  My experience wasn't unique, I think everyone in my group was fairly unhappy with the experience.  There are just too many great restaurants in Vegas, including many at the Bellagio, for me to waste my time and money on a place like Lago.  I won't be coming back.",

The caveat, as always, with Lago and other great restaurants on the Strip is that you pay a premium for occupying valuable real estate, even if it's only for an hour or two. The delicious $16 cocktails add up even faster than some of the tasty tapas.",

We started with the carpaccio, and although we would have preferred thicker crackers and maybe some capers, it was still good. The mushroom risotto was perfect, creamy with a variety of fungi. The lamb chops were flavorful, pretty tender, and well cooked with asparagus and potatoes accompanying them. Both the risotto and lamb chops were decently portioned. The potato gnocchi with lobster finger was good, but got cold too quickly and had an overwhelming fish taste that we didn't care for as much. That's the only item I wouldn't order again. For dessert, we shared the black forest cake and thought the cherry compote and sauce was a good touch to bring all the flavores together. The cucumber mist is a must! So refreshing!",

    "text": "Two of us got food poisoning and other than the view, not worth the hype. I heard amazing things about this place, and recommended to our group we go for dinner. There were multiple problems: 1. There were six of us and after we ordered, we told the server up front that we would like 3 separate checks - one for each couple. The server made a face as if this was a problem. I've been in the industry off and on for years, and I know how easy this is with the current computer systems. For such a highly rated and awarded restaurant, I would expect more graciousness. 2. One of our friends didn't receive his entree until 20 minutes AFTER we had all eaten ours. They did apologize and take it off the bill, but regardless there was no excuse for that kind of service other than clearly, the server missed entering it in the system. 3. Two of us woke up at around 3am with food poisoning and were sick for hours. We had completely different foods (him, the pizza and myself, the cod), so this tells me this is a food handling issue. 4. Prices at this restaurant are VERY expensive for the quality of the food. They are on par with New York City Michelin starred restaurants (I mean, for $44  - it better be the BEST cod I've ever had.) And unfortunately, the food is not quite at that level (especially when it's making you sick hours later.)  On a positive note, the restaurant is gorgeous, and the view - incredible... but for the overall experience - I do not have plans to return, and will not be recommending to others.",

At that time we asked for ice for our water on a hot day sitting on the patio and a new glass of water for one of the girls because there was a bug in it. A whole water show later he still didn't come by with it so we had to flag down someone else. When our first course arrived half of the orders were still wrong even though he took our order twice. Then when the second course came again orders were made wrong and one of the girls even had toast that was burnt black and they just covered it with the avocado. To top it off, when we went to grab desserts there were bugs sitting on a bunch of them. Honestly this was our first time here and the experience was horrible.",

It seems like 6 pieces won't get you stuffed- they do! Risotto (4.5/5) - so good, recommend it- very filling Linguine al pesto (1/5) - I love pesto and pasta but this dish literally had no flavor.

Unfortunatley it rained and the patio was closed which should of been an indicator for foreshadow to the rest of our experience there. To be honest, this resteraunt lacked a successful decorative theme. It looks like a bunch of mismatched modern pieces thrown into a space so we were not really feeling the feel of this place. When we sat at our table, our waiter came by and checked in with us. He reccomended a couple of dishes which we ended up ordering and not being crazy about. Rather, we were quite dissapointed. Not to mention, the service was also lacking. Considering the bread and oil came out to the table in the middle of our meal and not in the beginning is an example of the service. When I found a bug in my wine and asked for the wine to just be removed from our bill, he forced me to get another glass. He was too impatient as well. We ordered the spicy pizza, Salsiccia, but we were unimpressed. The sausauge was broken up into small pieces spread out on the pizza, and it really was unimpressive. We ordered the pesto pasta, which was a simple dish and good, but again, not mouthwatering. Everything was unimpressive. And for around 50.00 a person with a glass of wine, we felt it just was not worth it.",

First off I was hoping that the tables would be open to the fountains however they are not you do however have a unique view of the fountains.  Second I was hoping to get a little extra attention by letting staff know about the anniversary but really all they said was congratulations.  The staff was very good at everything else overall service was very good. The food was very good my only issue with small Plate restaurants is that they charge you like it's s full plate example is my wife ordered a 7x7 lobster and gnocchi and it came with 7 gnocchi's and 7 small chunks of lobster which is fine but a bit steep.  Overall not a bad experience the food was good just would have liked a little more even for a small plate place would really put this as a 3.75 stars",

Our seat wasn't terrible but did not have a real good view of the Bellagio fountains.  We reserved for brunch ($38 pp).  I expected to get little value for money but I could not have been more wrong.    The brunch is technically 4 courses: bread and pastry basket, second course entree, third course entree, and a dessert buffet.  The second course was a selection from roughly 10 items.  My date opted for the duck and polenta, which was pretty amazing and I selected the carbonara pasta which was decent but not mind blowing.  Our 3rd course, was yet again a selection from list of items available. She chose the scallop and shrimp over rice and I ordered steak and eggs. I was extremely jealous when I saw her plate but one bite of my steak and I couldn't have been happier.  The final course was a dessert buffet with pies, cookies,  crepes, bread pudding, and a chocolate fountain with fruit and other items for dipping.  We tried a few thing but were pretty full.    They did have bottomless Bloody Mary and mimosas for 28.  Maybe next time.  Really awesome place, at least for brunch.",

There's an outdoor seating section and unfortunately we were seated right next to the door and it often got stuck - not a lot of people bothered to close it, so we had the summer heat constantly blowing on us.  Absolutely make a reservation before you come here, I think I saw them turning people away in front of me.   We started with the caprese - absolutely delicious, but I'm probably biased because this is one of my favorite all time dishes. The dishes come out one at a time, by the time you've finished one they're usually pretty good about making sure the next one has already been placed on you time (if not the next 2).  Highly, highly recommend the burrata, we also had the cold cuts plater (because who doesn't love some dried meats?).  As far as pastas, we ordered linguine al pesto, gnocchi alla romana, funghi trifolati, and agnolotti di vitello. Other dishes ordered were polpette di carne and capasanta alla putanesca (scallops). My favorite dish was hands down the gnocchi alla romana - tasted like butter and the texture was fantastic. In all honesty, I would order any and all of the pastas again.   I am absolutely planning to come back.",

I had the blue cheese gnocchi (not super blue cheese tasting which is good for those who don't like that flavor) and I also had the buffalo milk ricotta focaccia. Both were wonderful. The only opposition I had with the experience was the waiter. It seemed after he noticed we weren't ordering wine (starting at about $20 a glass for a small glass) he gave our table less attention than those who would order more. This was annoying to see we didn't get the same experience as others but overall the food was wonderful and the view is unbeatable.",

I am not a fan of tapas so I ordered an entree and it was good, the proportion was just right for one person so your diet will stay in check.  Might be back for lunch someday.

The service was great from start to finish. The waitstaff is incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. Even the hostess who seated us was friendly as could be. We had the most exquisite white truffle risotto, as recommended by our waiter (Fabio, I believe) and I am dreaming about it still!!   We were fortunate to get a table outside with a view of the fountain show, this is the best place you can view it in Vegas while eating a wonderful meal. The food is Italian tapas style, need I say more? Make sure you stay for dessert, I highly recommend the Tiramisu. Can't wait to come back again. Enjoy ;)",

    "text": "Had a lovely pre-O dinner at Lago last month when we were visiting Vegas.  Everything from the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains to the top notch service left us feeling full and completely satisfied.  Since we had a group of 6, we were able to try a wide variety of the menu.  It's one of those meals where you try so many things, it's hard for any (or many) items to stand out, and to be fair, many of the items were pretty basic but enhanced by the grandness and atmosphere of an elegant Vegas restaurant.  That said, if you're looking for a great restaurant that appeals to a group of people with a nice view and on the Strip, Lago is a pretty reasonable option for both great tastes, tons of variety, and pretty reasonable price points.  Bruschetta al Pomodoro - perfectly crispy bruschetta that was seasoned well with the right amount of pomodoro topping, nothing memorable but a great starter and a classic Salmon Crudo - when I'm not pregnant, I will go back just to try every plate of crudo they have, but even being able to sample some of the salmon was enough for me that evening.  Fresh fresh fish, lightly accented with caper and delicious Branzino - probably one of my favorite items of the night, perfectly prepared and delicately flavored Meatballs - can't go wrong here, nothing standout, but still delish Braised Short Rib - a group pleaser  Baby Shrimp in White Wine Sauce - Delicate and tasty but not super memorable Mushroom Risotto - a nice heavier compliment to add some starch, not overly salty as some risotto can get Malloredos - pork sausage pasta that was quite tasty and an excellent choice There was a green pasta that I can't remember the name of but was very enjoyable as well Filettino - excellent cut of meat, prepared well  Overall a very enjoyable meal.  Definitely fits the Vegas standard of grand atmosphere and service.  The food is excellent, you can't go wrong.  You may not dream about the items later and you may not taste a flavor you've never experienced but you won't be disappointed.",

We were seated at a table just 2 over from the windows and had a wonderful view of the fountains. The music playing inside the restaurant syncs up with the show, so you feel like you're outside watching.   As expected, the portions are quite small, but for what you get, are not overpriced in my opinion. Our server suggested 3-4 plates per person, and I think we settled on 7 total, which was plenty. The Capasanta alla Putanasca and 7&7 were my favorite!  The wine menu is extensive, with bottles ranging from $60 to several thousand. Service was great (I really do disagree with anyone else on here stating that the service is poor. It isn't.) and the servers were knowledgeable. Highly recommended!",

The steak was very flavorful.   Definitely go for the bottomless mimosas- it was different than any other one I've had. Comes with this cool flavored wand and a gorgeous, edible sugar decor with the glass. Very lively ambiance and despite how busy they were, the managers (Albert and Lucio) made an effort to make sure we were happy and felt at home.   Now I'll have to try their dinner!",

We ordered drinks which were so unique and delicious, and some of the best food we have ever tasted.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I made it clear to the waiter that it was my boyfriends birthday, and while several other people in the restaurant were recognized for having birthdays, he wasn't which was disappointing. Also, we were really disappointed with one of the dishes (the asparagus), and when we told the waiter, he didn't even apologize or take it off the bill. Considering the amount we spent, I felt the service could have been better.  Overall, we had a great time and a delicious meal. We'll come back, but will hopefully have a different waiter.",

The burrata was one of the best I've ever had and their cocktails were beautiful and well presented. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the \"dress code.\" When choosing a restaurant at the Bellagio, Lago stated it had a 'business casual' dress code. My boyfriend and I thought this would be a perfect choice for a fancier night out. However, while sitting at the bar waiting for our drinks, a group of people sat next to us in flip flops and tank tops. If there's a dress code, it should be enforced in order to maintain a specific clientele.   I would definitely recommend Lago and will be returning if/when I return to Vegas!!",

Sounded like a great idea but what we got was a LOT of carbs- pasta, polenta, more pasta...did i mention there was pasta? Would have liked more fish and greens. Of the things we ate, the quality was meh at best. They did have these little semolina cakes with cheese that were delicious.  I will say they have a small outdoor space- great spot to watch the fireworks. If you're going to go, I'd try the food a la carte!",

They just should remove some tables and it would be great!!",

Only thing i would say id improve is the cocktail menu. It needs a few more interesting cocktails.  All in all a wonderful meal. One of our party said it was the best meal he has had in Vegas.",

This service was terrible! The food was also just okay. The tomato and burrata salad was just typical. The way it was plated was very boring. Next up was the zucchini pizza. Not bad, but again typical. We went to our next course which was the lamb ragu. This was pretty tasty, but the presentation was lack luster. Everything that touches the table, including the napkin and beverage naps has the Lago Logo on it. Very Cheesy!!! I think I get where I was dining. I never looked up and said... Where am I? From our female bartender to the Sommelier, the service they offered was very poor. The restaurant was not that busy, but yet they made it look like they were running around like crazy. I will not be going back anytime soon.",

I can see why so many reviewers are taking pictures--they want to show their friends how food is supposed to look when it is served. We had: SALMONE | Skuna Bay salmon | crispy caper 16 FUNGHI TRIFOLATI | mushrooms | olive oil | parsley 11 GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA | flat semolina gnocchi | blue cheese 14 RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI | shrimp-mascarpone stuffed ravioli | fresh tomatoes 17 AGNELLOSCOTTADITO | grilled lamb chops | garlic| rosemary 20 POLPETTE DI CARNE | tomato braised beef meatballs 15 The lamb chops are the best you will ever have. Everything else is very good. We had an assortment of desserts. It would be difficult to pick one out as being superior to the others.  As for ambiance, we sat at a table on the water. My wife and I agree this is the best location of any restaurant in Las Vegas. A table overlooking the Bellagio fountains on a pleasant April evening is hands-down the best locale in Las Vegas.  All in all, it was well worth it.",

Upon entering the restaurant, although I made a patio request which is a request, not gauranteed, it wasn't ready. We waited at the bar for about 30-40 minutes until our table was ready.  The restaurant may be intimidating on the inside due to the noise level and people coming in and out, but on the patio it included a beautiful watershow with a great view.  To be quite honest, if we didn't get patio seating I would have left and found somewhere else to eat. I believe there's a confusion when I ask for \"fine dining\" and I'm told by the hostess that it's considered fine dining with the noise level.  For a special occasion I prefer quieter more romantic settings where this is more for social dinners.  None of the dishes were memorable but I do remember ordering beef and my SO made a comment after trying it first, \"Have you ever had a sausage mcmuffin from McDonalds?\" I take a bite of it and I go, \"Oh...\" Lol.  This restaurant has so much potential if the food had more flavor! I've had better Italian sadly for half the price.",

The positives: Excellent very tasty food! My brother in law and his wife said their meal was very delicious. My husband had the grilled lamb chops and he said they were the best he's ever had: done perfectly and just melted in your mouth. I had the veal scallopini that was just amazing: it melted in your mouth with the best flavor! Our salads were excellent and fresh. My asparagus was nice and al dente. Our desserts were so fresh and delicious too! I had decaf coffee which didn't taste like decaf it was so good! The negatives: Very very loud. I should have checked yelp before booking! That is a complaint my brother in laws wife said she read on yelp. I avoid loud like the plague. We had to talk loud to communicate:( Very modern decor: not my thing and not comfortable.  Crowded tables.   I suppose the small plates can be nice if you want to build your plate with what you prefer rather than what comes with the dinner. It was my first time and a little confusing as to how much I should order.  It worked out though.   In short: loud, but tasty.",

Maybe I just picked the wrong dishes but for the price I don't feel encouraged to give them a 2nd chance.   Beef Carpaccio - 3/5 If your in Bellagio just go to Olives for this. After eating it there anywhere else you have it will seem sub par. Lago's version can't even begin to compare to Olives.   Kobe Beef - 0/5 The meat itself was literally the size of a matchbook, I knew it would be tiny but was still excited to try it. I cut the meat up (even though it was itty bitty bc I was trying to be dainty). Question, Have you ever bit into a piece of meat that made your mouth water, looked tender and flavorful only to have an explosion of grease fill your mouth? Ya me neither and it caught me off guard. I couldn't even finish this TINY sad piece of meat that's how bad it was. Was it deep fried? We paid $39 for this?..this animal died for you to turn it into something completely inedible. Shame. On. You.  Fusilli Ragu - 4/5 Had great flavor but the pasta was overcooked..like I had to scoop this shit bc it fell apart. Im not a stickler for al dente but this was ridiculous. Everyone liked the flavor though.  Caesar Salad - 4/5 Would have been the best part of my meal but had a little salty aftertaste. Wasn't bad just different.  Meatballs - 4/5 They're just meatballs what else is there to say.",

Our hostess seated me while my husband cashed out at the bar. She told me we had a time limit on the table that is strictly enforced and expected me to agree to it before I sat down which I did not and deferred to my husband. He really had his heart set on trying Julian Serrano's food. The hostess told him that we had a finite amount of time at the table and walked away. Neither of us were pleased at the idea of spending hundreds of dollars for dinner and being rushed              through it. We then sat at the table for at least ten minutes without any server acknowledging that we were even there. During this time my husband went to Open Table a booked a reservation across the street at Giada's which has small plates and entrees of delicious Italian food. We had eaten there a few nights before and were blown away by how great the food and service was. On our way out we made a point of telling the manager what had happened at Lago and he said that they don't strictly enforce time limits on tables. What kind of fine dining establishment puts time limits on their tables??? The kind that we will not pay top dollar for fast food with slow service!",

The waiter assured me that would not be the case because everything is small plates to share. I had tastes of caesar salad, zucchini pizza, meatballs, vegetable pasta and filet.  I can't decide which I liked better--the meatballs or the filet--both melted in my mouth. The beautiful setting, the dancing fountains, the service, the food and the company gave way to a perfect Las Vegas dinner.  Thank you, Lago.",

    "text": "I visited recently with two amazing friends I have not seen in a year. This was definitely a special pre dinner meet for us. I have the say that the extravagant bill we had was mainly for the view -- which was, without a doubt, one of the Best on all of Las Vegas Strip.   We started with a bottle of Chardonnay and muscles. Both were delicious but not to Die for. My girlfriends and I  were enamored with each other after such a long time, that everything was amazing.   Next came the cold cuts and cheese. The presentation really lacked for me and the meats was a little warm but tasty. Lots of fatty bits. The pieces of cheese were embarrassing. I've had bigger chunks from a Whole Foods sample plate. There wasn't anything to Die for on that plate for me.   Next came the mushroom ravioli. The serving had 3 or 4 small ravioli. I think it was 3. Again, it was very delicious but not to Die for.   Then came a second bottle of wine and red wine risotto. The risotto was very good but that's all it was. Just risotto. We enjoyed it but it's not a dish I will crave.   Our pre dinner apps and wine cost us over $200. That is absolutely insane to me. I've been living in Las Vegas for over a decade and I've gotten used to the Off The Strip quality, decadence and luxury of fine local dinning that sources responsibly and with quality experience in mind as well but at half of the cost.   Corkage fee at Lago is $50. So sorry, I'm used to excellent service at places like Echo & Rig that offer free corkage at any time.  My stars are for the incredible decor, great service and a breathtaking view. The food did not win my palate. I enjoyed the company of my great friends and glad I got to experience this place, but for an experienced local Las Vegas foodie, we know where to find a killer meal/app teaser where the view won't matter a single bit.",

The booths look opulent and the table decor is simple but elegant. The waiters are very friendly as well. I enjoyed my meal at Lago but I would highly recommend everyone to get the prix fixe the desserts that come with it make it so worth  it. It costs about 13 individually. I had a wonderful pasta dish called Cannelloni. It was an amazing dish with rich flavors and subtle sweetness from the sauce. My only complaint is the small protons for 16 dollars they give you 4 pastas which is pretty pricey. Next time I'm for sure going to get the prix fixe. The cappers salad looked so good!",

    "text": "Surprising a stunning place to have lunch. I'm always so skeptical about eating at restaurants with a nice view bc usually you are trading off a good meal for a nice view. However, I enjoyed everything that I got. I looked into this spot bc they do a 3 course meal for $28 for lunch, which IMO is a steal for a killer meal and in Vegas. From the set we opted for a antipasto misto (addtl $5), margherita pizza, and chefs choice dessert (Orange cannolis). We also added the linguine fruitti di Mari and sauteed mushrooms. The portion size for the antipasto was huge, could really be enough to feed 3. Comes w 3 deli meats, roasted peppers, olives, and of course burrata. Wasn't expecting much from the pizza, but turned out actually really tasty with a nice crispy crust. Fruitti di Mari comes with a good mix of seafood and linguine perfectly al dente. The shrooms were just ok imo, I could pass on these tbh and get the fries next time. Cannolis were very light and airy, the candied Orange was a nice touch as well. Even though the water show does not start until 3pm, the view is still very nice.",

We ordered the beef carpaccio-it came with the pieces of beef, cheese, arugula, and crispy chips-like thing. The beef carpaccio plate was actually larger than we expected. The beef was tender.   2. Seafood risotto came with shrimp, mussels, and scallop. This risotto was rich in flavor and I believe there was some tomato broth in it. It was sweet and the seafood and risotto were cooked to perfection.  3. Salmone is a dish with pistachio crusted salmon pieces and broccolini. The salmon was cooked perfectly with pistachio crusted pieces on top. The broccolini was too bitter for our liking.  4. We also ordered the Calamaro-a dish with shrimp stuffed inside the calamari. There were 4 pieces of this. The seafood was cooked properly but lacked a bit of salt.  I think I would come back here just for the beef carpaccio!",

    "text": "Great pick for a classy dinner while in Vegas.   Not just because the food is delicious (more on that later) but also because of the location. Lago overlooks the fountains at the Bellagio and at night when the fountains light up the view is absolutely beautiful. We weren't lucky enough to snag outdoor seating but you can still catch this from inside because of how many big windows there are.  Food is small plates Italian and everything comes out FAST. So if you want to order course by course to see how much food you'll need you can definitely do that. We were pretty hungry and ordered 5 plates amongst the two of us. I'd say you need at least 4 plates for dinner because they are pretty small.  To start we had the burrata which was actually my least favorite part of the meal. The plate came with a generous portion of cheese but for some reason it didn't look or taste like burrata. It felt more like a ricotta cheese dip. Not bad, but not what we were expecting. And a little frustrating because burrata comes with a heftier price tag.  Luckily the rest of the meal made up for it. Gnocchi with lobster chunks is a must get. This comes in a delicious pink sauce and the lobster is oh so decadent. Crab, artichoke and parmesan are three of my favorite things independently, so on a plate together this was unreal good. This dish felt fresh and healthy, almost like a salad. I loved how it was topped with multicolored cherry tomatoes. And there was a very generous portion of crab in the dish. Veal and ricotta stuffed pasta - the mans favorite. Very small portion - three little dumplings but so rich that it did not need to be larger. And finally to round out the meal we put in an order of meatballs which were classic and tasty. Sounds like alot of food, but both pasta dishes were only a few small bites.   For drinks we went with cocktails -- I had some sort of fruity vodka drink and it was light and refreshing. They also brought out a piece of cake that said happy birthday and a candle for my fiance's birthday upon request. Super sweet and he really enjoyed it! The cake was chocolate espresso... 'nuff said.  A pricey meal, but what else could you expect at The Bellagio - especially when cocktails and lobster are thrown into the mix. For a similar meal expect to spend around 100 PP. But, for delicious food in a swanky setting this is worth it.",

We had the linquini clams, Costa Di Manso / slow cooked short ribs , and osso bucco.   Skip the Costa Di Manso slow cooked short ribs!  Not worth the  $ 25 for  4 square thinly slices of meat.

We ordered the following:  BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO -- 5/5 How could you go wrong with bruschetta....it was delicious. We definitely wanted seconds. :)  BURRATA -- 5/5 Dekicious and plenty to share as an appetizer among three people.   GNOCCHI -- 5/5 Absolutely delicious and savory! Loved the sauce.  CAPASANTA ALLA PUTANASCA -- 4/5 Pretty salty and very small for the price we paid. I love scallops, but had I know that this wasn't a pasta I wouldn't have ordered it. The title was misleading because I thought the \"Putanasca\" was a type of pasta, but I later discovered that it's the name of the sauce that is tossed with the pasta. Oh well!  RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO -- 5/5 Yes to all the mushrooms! Great balance between the risotto, mushroom and sauce ratio. Excellent.   LINGUINE AL PESTO -- 4/5 It had the things I like in my food but I wasn't blown away. Tasted pretty bland in my opinion, but it was filling and probably would have paired up well with the scallops now that I think about it...",

The food is basic, I recommend the linguine al pesto. We ordered so many dishes considering it's a tapas restaurant and that's the only dish that was good. We also ordered two desserts and they were HORRIBLE, the chocolate cake and the limoncello. Just horrible, we didn't eat it and when the waiter asked if we were done, I commented on the fact that dessert wasn't good at all and he laughed!",

The prices are a little expensive but not too bad.  It was all delicious and I really enjoyed the food. It was also really cool to just look to the window and see the show going on. The music being played outside for the show is also being played Inside during dinner as well.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who like Italian food and tapas style eating.  Come with a fun group and an appetite and be prepared for a free show with your meal.",

    "text": "A tale of two lunches. After the tourist trap disaster of lunch at Giada there was the delicious, delightful lunch the next day at Lago. I was never a fan of Julian Serrano's tapas restaurant at Aria, so I was hesitant to try this lakefront beauty at Bellagio. This take on Italian small plates is outstanding. The location and view is spectacular and the interior is a funky mess that works. The Rosso Bellini cocktail was a fun start to lunch. The Golden Raspberry in the nest was completely different from anything I'd ever had. The Speck pizza made with Buffalo Ricotta and Cipollini  onions was a flavor bomb! Perfect light airy crust and a creamy spicy combination of toppings proved to be a real winner. The excellent caprese salad made with fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Basil, Heirloom tomatoes, and EVOO, rounded out the meal. Great bright, fun, tasty, spot for lunch at Bellagio.",

When we first arrived, we had to wait 10 minutes for our table to be prepared, despite having a reservation. Throughout the meal, servers kept asking to take our plates even when we weren't finished, creating a very rushed atmosphere.   For the food, the only dish that stood out was the ahi tuna. Be warned that the portions are very small. They say that it's \"tapas\" style, but some the dishes are difficult to share. They're not tapas, they're just small.   I ordered the lamb ragu pasta, which luckily was filling, but the taste was fairly average. At Lago's price point, I was really expecting to be wowed. I also ordered the tiramisu for dessert. It was beautifully presented and tasty, though not astounding.   Overall, if you're looking for a fancy dinner on the Strip, I would look else where. Even the views are only really spectacular if you're seated close to a window.",

It is so dreamy, and even in the colder months they have the heaters cranked up to keep you comfortable.   I loved the mushroom risotto! It was full of flavor and an excellent choice. Our server recommended eating family style since the food is served tapas style. I loved being able to try a bunch of things. He said order 2-4 dishes per person for dinner!  Definitely make a reservation if you can beforehand, it gets quite busy around dinner. Absolutely worth the wait though! Great food, even better views!",

I had the shrimp ravioli small plate and was very disappointed in the taste of the food. I expected from the menu prices to be impressed, but it tasted very commercial. It appeared to be ground shrimp that was in a canned sauce.   I was also not impressed with the wine value. $20 for a glass of subpar Chianti did not win me over.   I was super bummed because I really wanted to like this restaurant. My friend got the Caprese and she said it was delicious.",

The staff is attentive, the view of the water show is great and the food, the foods just fine. I know what you might be thinking, I have high standards and I am a spoiled foodie from San Francisco. The food was good but it didn't blow my mind and it certainly was not a life changing experience for the price. Glad I got to go check it out but I;m not planning on returning any time soon.  The caprese salad was a bit of a disappointment. Not enough basil, chunks of salt were good along with the other parts of it.   The Salami was 3 cuts, a smaller portion. The homemade bread crisps we're very crispy but with limited flavor.  The pork pasta also had a muted flavor, it did have tons of sausage. And the same for the seafood risotto. I felt like the flavors were conflicting and could have been more prominent, also needed more cheese. Same as the pasta it was loaded with meat (mostly lobster.)  Meatballs were mushy and could have been slightly more solid, instead they just dissolved under a fork or knife.  Beer selection not so great but the cocktails looked good.  With all of the dishes we ordered the flavor was clean and everything was  prepared perfectly, it just didn't have a ton of flavor.",

    "text": "One of my TOP 4 favorite Vegas Brunches that I frequent & LOVE!  Lago's Sunday brunch & bottomless mimosas & bloody Mary's all to die for.  Julian Serrano has never disappointed me as a matter of fact, he personally introduced himself to me twice & recommended a certain  thing which will be part of my Yelp on his Aria restaurant.  Lago's brunch is a magical & artsy display of colors & beauty overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Order both the bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary whichever you prefer first, but definitely try both.  Come w/ an appetite & take all that this 3-course brunch has to offer!    The pastry basket is an Italian twist of yummy cornetto, zeppole, muffins, scones, croissants, donuts, cinnamon rolls & bombolone.  I've eaten here many times so will not steer your taste buds wrong.  In order of my favorite & highly recommended, let's begin!  First Course choices... ANTIPASTO MISTO:  Burrata, prosciutto, salami, olives, bell peppers.  Awesome w/ one of their wines from a fantastic selection of wines.  MAC CARBONARA:  Pancetta, eggs yolks, pecorino, black pepper.  Rich & decadent small macaroni noodles mmm!  I'd add a lil spice to it of course.   CAESAR SALAD:  Roasted chicken & hard boiled eggs.  It was good, but needed more dressing.    Second Course... CHICKEN \"FLORENTINE STYLE\" A-Must!!  You could cut the moist chicken w/ a fork.  It's stuffed w/ this delicious spinach-ricotta!   So tasty & my absolute fav!  I want it on the menu everyday!   ITALIAN SAUSAGE FRIED BURGER:  House made Italian sausage & fried egg.  Large so share everything!  Even though they are known for small plates, the whole brunch is very filling. EGGPLANT PARMESAN BENEDICT:  Exactly what it says w/ a poached egg.   I actually didn't like this at all.  Bland, tasteless, but perfectly poached egg lol.  Lastly the BEST part!!  Why you shared & saved your appetite is the unbelievable DESSERT DISPLAY!!   The PANETTONE PUDDING oh melt in your mouth!  It's like they made it w/ love as your mom or grandma would. CLASSIC TIRAMISU & NUTELLA CRESPELLE also do.    Let's get back to the artsy wonderful mimosa & Bloody Mary's.  I squeezed all the creatively placed Tabasco, horseradish & soy sauce droppers stuck in a cucumber display all into my Bloody Mary.. Mmm tasty & so good!  It's also filling.  The mimosa taste is ok, but the lavish golden sugar display on top is absolutely the most beautiful mimosa I've ever seen.  Picture worthy!    Overall, I love Lago's for all meals, but especially brunch.  Treat yourself to all of this from $50 to $80.  It's worth every second & starts your week off on the right foot.",

    "text": "It started out fine. We had a reservation and went there early at about 8:15 PM. The restaurant was accommodating and we were seated right away. Our waitress asked what we wanted to drink and handed us menus. Although we asked for a table that had a view of the water show, we were seated in the front portion of the restaurant where I noticed most families with kids were.  It was okay since I am sure everyone wanted a table looking out the waters. However, my daughter could hardly see the waters and was bummed out on her special day. I did inform the restaurant she was celebrating her birthday, but no one ever mentioned it or wished her a happy birthday.   Our waitress was gone for a long while before she reappeared with the water.  Luckily, we managed to ordered before she disappeared again since we did not see her for the rest of our dinner.  We drank our water sparingly since we did not see our waitress after she took our order. My daughter and husband's lemonades sat empty and unfilled for the duration of our dining experience.   Finally, after we long finished our dinner and our glasses sat empty, another waiter came to ask if we wanted refill on our drinks and asked if we needed anything. This might have turned things around if only we got our drink refills.  Nope!  I guess it was too hard to fill our waters and get two glasses of lemonades.  The second waiter acknowledged our request, but our drink refills never showed up!  A while later, our waitress returned. She was nice and all, but it was hard to hunt her down. She gave us our check when we were still waiting for our drinks. Then she was gone again for a long time.  At some point after running our credit card, she must have remembered we told her about the refills, and she put the two lemonades in to go cups.     The service here was absolutely subpar. The food itself was fine, but not spectacular.  It was just not a special occasion kind of place with a nice view my daughter had hoped for on her birthday.  Also, a table was sat behind us while we were waiting on our bill. Their waiter told them about specials and offering not on the menu which we never heard from our waitress. This was irritating since some of the items sounded liked something we would have wanted to try.  Since it was Thanksgiving, we still left our waitress a decent tip. However, I have to say I was not impressed that I could not get waters and lemonades after paying $150 for four small tapas style plates.",

The atmosphere is bright and modern and elegant with a big widow with a beautiful view of the water in front of the Bellagio and a beautiful part of the Las Vegas Strip.  I came here to try the three course $29.00 Lunch.  I started with a Caprese Salad. I received the finest Heirloom Tomatoes, Creamy Buffalo Mozzarella that was dressed with quality balsamic and oil and crisp sea salt flakes. It was simple but extra delicious. It seemed like the balsamic had the smallest touch of honey in it.  My husband enjoyed the Antipasto Misto. ($5. up-charge) He received a generous plate of Burrata, Prosciutto, Porchetta, Quality Olives, roasted Red Peppers and really crisp thin breads.  Lunch was Bronzino Livornese presented on slow roasted sweet tomatoes with capers and olives. The fish had a crispy seasoned skin and the plate was finished with plump roasted Asparagus.  My husband had the Four Cheese Spinach Lasagna. It was layers of fresh made pasta with a delicious cheese filling and topped with fresh spinach in a pool of delicious tomato sauce.  Dessert was Chef's Choice and was a STUNNING MASTERPEICE**********************************  Two DETAILED layer cakes one lemon and one Chocolate with fancy chocolate art work and gold.   Meringues.

I love this place and will be back for sure. Everything is an A+ the resturant is bright romantic and very clean. I couldn't have had a better experience. You have to come try this place at least once.  UPDATE: I'm here for my one year anniversary and have the honor of having Antonio again and I'm thrilled about it. He's one of a kind and the main reason I came back! This Caesar salad is amazing I highly recommend it! The Bellagio water show is live in front of you make sure you sit at the balcony outside.",

It was really hot, but the view of the fountain show was worth it. The fountain came on three times during the time we were there and it was beautiful every time.   We started with the Margherita pizza and the minestrone soup. The pizza was a perfect size and it was delicious. For the main course we shared the mushroom risotto, the seafood risotto, and the shrimp mascarpone stuffed ravioli. The ravioli was my favorite. I  can eat another bowl of it.   For dessert we ordered the creme brulee. It was topped with a lady finger. It wasn't too sweet which was perfect.   This will definitely be a memorable birthday. Love the food, atmosphere, and the staff was very attentive. Our water glass were always filled and our waiter took our order right away. Food came out in a timely manner. I  would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and will recommend Lago to friends.",

We started with the cheese plate and it was delicious with a nice variety of cheeses! We then got the meatballs which were amazing! As an Italian, I am very particular when it comes to red sauce and meatballs and these were great! I do prefer smooth red sauce to chunky so this was right up my alley! Four our entrees we got the Lobster gnocchi and the Osso buco. Both were exceptional! The osso buco was tender and seasoned nicely. The lobster was not over cooked and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly. Dessert was lack luster. We got the tiramisu and it's a different take on the classic. They put a crunchy angel cake on top and it was a little of putting and harder to eat because they did not break easy. A bit pricey but you're in Vegas!",

You can do a guaranteed table outdoor for $200 per person.  End up getting to sit inside because there was a private party outside. Sat by the window which is nice too cause we were in the middle and the room was not crowded. There were only 3 other large party.  We did Sunday brunch for $38 per person. Select 2 course on the menu and dessert is also included. Worth the money because it's pretty filling. They put out a \"happy birthday\" note with different desserts on a plate with a candle at the end for somebody's birthday.  You can also do All you can drink for $28 per person (Mimosas, Bellini, Bloody Mary)  We had Alessandro as our server and he was really nice.  I recommend this place for a good brunch for a good price and service as well as atmosphere.",

I kept attempting to get any server's attention, but they all ignored us. When our server finally came around we were done eating what food we did receive and asked if we were happy. We told her the situation and she apologized and left. Did not see her again for 15 minutes, whem she asked if we wanted anything else, which we jist wanted the bill. She was nice enough to take off the food we did not receive, but still had to pay for what we did receive without a discount or anything at all. During this whole time we never even got out water glass refilled. We were the imvisible table. Do not eat here. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had.

It was a Sunday night and the only thing available were high tops near the bar despite the restaurant looking not that busy.  We sat at high tops and ordered two drinks.  I got the Rose and Rye I believe it was called which was delicious.  The sweet with underlying Rye spice was very well balanced.  The presentation was also nice.  My date got a Jameson and ginger that didn't taste that good at first.  It appeared and tasted as if the soda was flat which is no big deal.  It took the server a bit to check back with us but we did get our drink replaced.  I think the high top seats are served by lounge or cocktail servers opposed to waiter and waitresses.  I can honestly say I wasn't impressed with our server.  She didn't seem very attentive, but hey everyone has off days.  The food was amazing!  The variety of selections are nice as well as the ability to share.  The clams were good and not too spicy and the steak was cooked perfectly.  I would go back here time and time again for the ambiance and food alone as well as visit one of Chef's other restaurants in town.",

I took the earlier one and am so glad I did. Despite the opening night jitters the staff seemed to be experiencing, the service was im-pe-cca-ble. I know they'd had three nights to practice on the creme de la creme fortunate enough to attend one of the \"soft openings\", but they said that it was different now that it's \"real\". :)  Also ridiculously, I can boast that I was the first customer to order the Lago cocktail, the one with the edible flower suspended in an ice sphere and sprinkled with glitter. It is a visual masterpiece and obviously, someone put a lot of thought into developing it. I felt a little guilty when I asked if the bartender would be willing to use Nolet's gin instead of the vodka in the original recipe. S/he was, and our server told us they'd run out to another bar to get it.   We ordered: the seafood wrapped in other seafood with limoncello, the sausage/gorgonzola toast, the canneloni stuffed with short ribs, the langostinos, the filet with gorgonzola, and the shrimp ravioli.  Now for the \"feedback\" part:  ~All very good, though the sauce on the ravioli was extremely salty (didn't prevent us from just scraping it off and mowing down on the pasta itself) . We did mention it to the server.  ~Some (ok, maybe most) will find the portions skimpy. Prices are what you can expect - similar to places like Jaleo, Giada, Rose. Rabbit. Lie., etc. You know, the ubiquitous small-plates joints.  ~Just to make it easy on the bartenders, if the spirit is on the menu, there should be a bottle of it at the bar...I still feel badly that someone had to run out for the Nolet's.   Overall, a wonderful experience! The food was plated beautifully and presented with enthusiasm. It is good. It is also (so far) probably just on par with the offerings of other elegant strip dining establishments. Chef Serrano is one of the best, and maybe I'm just partial to his namesake restaurant in Aria, but Lago at this point is a little, well, average. It distinguishes itself mainly for decor, ambiance, and service. I   My 4-star review notwithstanding, it's Ridiculously exciting!",

    "text": "I have many qualms about Lago.  First the place is so loud you cannot speak to your company.  Second the service is pushed, too intense and not at all relaxing.  More importantly the food was just so so.  Small portions, way to small in my opinion.  10$ for three slivers of lettuce is a joke.  The octopus had no flavor.  The pasta is genuinely good, but again for noodles and sauce at $15 I expect a little more.  I hate going out to a place with mediocre food and leaving $150 poorer and still have to go eat elsewhere because I'm hungry 2 hours later.   Don't waste your money.",

    "text": "My family and I went this past Sunday (we were in town for the MayPac fight) and this was the highlight of our trip!!!    I have been a big fan of JS for a long time and have gone to Picasso & JS in Aria every time I am in Las Vegas (about 4-5 times a year) and was very excited to hear that Lago was opening up in the old Circo space (that was a terrible restaurant).    The restaurant is overlooking the famous fountains and if you had seen Circo before, you wouldn't recognize one thing about the space.  It was a complete gut renovation and looks awesome.  Very 50's Mod/Space age vibe with lots of gleaming white, chrome and marble.  Very cool concepts with the type of food they are serving.  We ordered a ton of food as we like to try everything the first time we go somewhere and there were some definite stand-outs.  Like JS Aria, the menu is small plates concept and they split the menu between breads (mini pizza, crostini, flat breads), crudo, veg, meat, pasta and seafood and then large share plates.  We started off with the crostini and focaccia breads and we could have ordered multiples of each.  The stand out this section was definitely the crostini with the olives and pecorino and the nduja focaccia.  The bread itself was perfectly cooked and salted.  For our 2nd course, we had the crudo of scallop and salmon.  Both were great, but the Scallop was really delicious.  Raw scallop isn't for everyone, but the texture and citrus flavors of this dish were really wonderful.  3rd course; Pasta & Risotto!!!  The highlights were definitely the red wine risotto and the 7&7 Gnocchi with lobster reduction.  Flavors, textures and ingredients were on point.  For our meat (protein) course, we had the Vongole clams, branzino and lamb chops.  The flavors were classic on all of these and not too innovative, but regardless the dishes were all exceptional especially the chops.  Usually when you get lamb chops as a small plate, they are tiny and very thin.  These were very thick and juicy with great moisture and flavor.  For dessert; we had the mini cannoli's were great and a perfect way to finish off the meal as they weren't overly sweet and had just enough ricotta and citrus zest to make them almost a palate cleanser.    A few things that could change; they put their drinks and dessert on a iPad, which is really annoying and not necessary.  Its cumbersome and not worth the hassle to click thru images and pages when you could review a menu much more easily.  iPads have been around for while now, and its not very cool either way to have to swipe and touch a screen that many other hands have touched....talk about passing germs before you eat food with your hands.  The restaurant is loud and crowded.  High ceilings and vast space make it very loud, so don't expect a romantic date night.  Also, the seating is odd.  They mixed all different shape tables and seating, which make the restaurant extremely tight to maneuver (the hostess couldn't figure out how to get us to our table and we had to loop around) and you are sitting very close to every table around you.    In reading some of the other reviews, a big complaint is the pricing and portions.  Not sure why people complain about pricing, when thats reviewable prior to going and as for the portions, even for \"small\" plate standards; there were really healthy portion sizes.  The waiter will recommend 3-4 plates per person and we ordered that and it was perfect and extremely filling.  Without ordering too much alcohol, you can definitely eat there for $50-$75 a person.  A lot of the food is very classic with flavors that people will recognize from their favorite Italian dishes, but most of the food is very innovative with amazing ingredients and flavors. I highly recommend Lago and can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "If you want a great dining experience, let's be honest--you can find it anywhere at Bellagio. They definitely have this whole food & beverage/amazing service thing down. Still, Lago is just beyond. From the location (floor-to-ceiling windows and even an outdoor patio overlooking the fountains--pretty flawless) to the decor (sleek, modern & gorgeous), let's just say I would be here every night if they would have me (what would it take to get my name engraved on one of those tables...?)  The menu consists of small plates meant to be shared (they recommend 3-4 plates per person), which you'll love if you're like me and want to try ALL THE THINGS. If the menu is overwhelming (everything sounds amazing. hello!), your server (shoutout to Frank!) will guide you through the best of the best.  Some of my favorites include the \"7&7\" lobster and gnocchi (want to eat this, exclusively, forever. will die happy if this is my last meal. you get it.), all the crudo plates (the scallop one is ridiculous. didn't think I liked scallops before this. game changer), the focaccine with ricotta and honey, margherita pizza and the osso buco (veal shank). I assume there's a word-count limit here, so I'll stop myself, but just know that I could go on...   I'm still working my way through the fabulous cocktail offerings, but so far I've been blown away. No detail was overlooked in creating these beautiful drinks (the Rosso Bellini straight-up has a caramel nest propped atop the glass with a golden raspberry nestled inside. Is this real life?). The Cucumber Mist is super-refreshing, and I may or may not have had two of them back-to-back. I also loved the Passion Fruit Mojito. But, like I said, won't quit 'til I try 'em all #goals and will report back. And, do check out the bar area--great atmosphere if you're just looking to try out a couple drinks and small plates.  Thank you to Chef Serrano and the entire Lago team! We'll be back soon!",

When we arrived, we asked to be seated by the window so we could enjoy the bellagio fountain, but was told that this area is reserved for people staying at the Bellagio.  Why?  We pay the same as they do.  We were staying at the Aria.  They should have been honored that we spent money in their Restaurant. instead we were placed several seats away where there was a lot of traffic.  They didnt put alot of thought into the seating arrangement.  People had to squeeze through our table to get through and that was very distracting and annoying.  The servings were very small, but expensive.  $160.00+ later, we were still hungry when we left.  We will not be going back to Lago, and I will be sharing my experience at Lago with my blog followers.",

The seating area makes you think of 2 different places in one, the front area is very laid back with high top areas around the bar and the dining room is sleek and modern with seating along floor to ceiling windows with great views. One of the cocktails I tried was a raspberry bubbly and another with blood orange, both good, although the orange was on the bitter side. The dessert we shared was also raspberry and the chocolate and both were winners. By comparison, the food fell very short. We had 2 different pizettes which were both bland, and the sausage had a different texture. The caprese salad which I normally adore was bland, along with a strange flavor from the balsamic. This is not par for the coarse at a Bellagio restaurant. If the food had some flavor and a dash of seasoning, it could have been better. The pictures of the dishes deceived me, because all looked delicious.",

We made a reservation for a group of four two days in advance and when we got there we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated though the place really wasn't full (we only stayed because we'd heard good things). We decided to order a bottle of wine while we waited for our table and what an ordeal that was! The hostess took us to the bartender who then said we needed to wait for the wine server, who just came out with an iPad full of wine selections that they actually didn't have on the premises but they will have at some point. Eventually we did find a bottle of Riesling after about 4 tries and then we were seated at our table. Everything was good, I'd like to give it another try when their service is together.",

I can't speak much for the food aside from the fact that it was good yet with smaller portions than one could have hoped for.

Octopus in a spicy tomato sauce saved us the airfare to the region of Italy where this dish has been perfected.     Sea bas with olives, capers, tomatoes, asparagus should be on the menu forever.

Location: great view of the Bellagio fountain Service: 5 stars!! Our waiter was EXCELLENT! Such a nice guy. He definitely is a great asset to this place. Food: small plates, share. Good quality, beautiful, fresh, appropriately priced. We basically ordered almost all the dishes off their menu. Dessert: beautiful and delish! They also provided house dessert for b-day and it was really good--I think this was the service from our waiter!",

There was no need for him to mock a guest that is about to dine at the restaurant. His action had made me decide to leave and dine elsewhere. What a shame!

Hoped for a higher level of customer service (acknowledgement of the wait, overall friendliness....it was just very matter of fact-you're table is ready, follow me). We were seated without a drink menu, which was odd since typically you order drinks before food. The drink menu came later. I ordered the Lago Cocktail sweet, and it came spicy. One of the menus was dirty with food-switching out the page would've been a quick fix. Some plastic drink cups and spilled food remained on the floor behind us for the entire time we were there. Caprese salad and ricotta and honey focaccia were excellent. Shrimp w/ white wine lacked flavor and presentation. Filettino was perfectly prepared. Mushroom risotto was okay. We left still hungry-too underwhelmed with the food and overall experience to try additional items.",

They seated us in a little corner outside as my husband had requested outdoor eating...it was uncomfortable and literally in the corner (as I'm 6 months pregnant)! Twice other tables opened up but when we requested to move the waiter would respond \"they are taken\"...how are they taken of supposedly you can't make a reservation outside? Food is too weird and it's trying too hard to be unique but doesn't even taste that good! I know it's tapas and meant to share but literally the pizza is like smaller than a kids personal pizza! When you order food immediately comes out as if it's all prepared and I felt as tho we were being rushed through the entire dinner when we were trying to enjoy our anniversary dinner! Waiter was not friendly either and no help when we asked questions about things on the menu! Only thing this place has going for them is the view to the fountains of you are lucky enough to get a decent seat...not like our little corner table! Plenty of better dining choices in vegas, don't bother coming here!",

And the cucumber drink.  So good food and nice view possibility for those that are considering. It was definitely louder than we were expecting but wasn't a big deal to Us but something to know if that type of vibe is t your thing.  We were there for my husbands bday and no one referenced that it was a special occasion which was also a bit of a bummer",

The Caeser looked okay but was actually amazing and it had a wonderful helping of white anchovies on the side (I absolutely love anchovies!). The linguine was really, really good but didn't blow me away but the damn dessert did (it was some chocolate thing that the waiter recommended). I was in and out in 45 minutes with a big smile on my face. Did I mention this place looks out on the fountains?

I was so disappointed in the food we were served. We were served three starters: a bruschetta that was delightful, a flatbread that was ok and a scallop sashimi that was fine. Next course was two kinds of risotto - both were bland and undercooked. Next we were served three meat dishes: a steak and potatoes dish - meat was under seasoned as well, meatballs - which looked fantastic, but alas were not seasoned well, and a white fish - not bad. I did not get to see a menu or order my own food, so I don't know if dining off the menu would have been different, but I was severely underwhelmed by what we did get. It is Such a beautiful location and my dining expectations were not met. The 6 other people I was sitting nearest also felt the same.",

There weren't that many options and everything is egg based (including the lasagna), so if you hate any kind of eggs on your food that's not breakfast...don't come here. The portions are also pretty small, so not for sharing. The service was not that great, but I liked that the waiters all looked neat & clean.

    "text": "This is a great, new place to have a special dinner in Las Vegas. While the Belagio hotel and casino is nicely decorated, the bright blue and white decor of Lago is nice and refreshing.  We arrived early for our reservation and were seated out on the enclosed patio. It's a great place to sit. You miss the excitement of the main room, but it's nice. We started with the Fegatini di Pollo, the chicken liver crostini - toasted bread. It was the hit of the night. Also, Tonno Crudo di Pesce, Ahi tuna with orange segments. Delicious. A pasta di Pesce, 7 & 7, the potato and lobster plate was another hit. The Impepata di Cozze, PEI mussels were plump and juicy, about the best mussels we've had. Deserts were just perfect, little cannolis and panna cada was absolutely delicious.  Carlos gave us great service. Of course, a great room, a creative executive chef, good food well-prepared and well-served might all be for naught without high-class service from support waitstaff. We got that from Elmer. He made sure to warm up the coffee cup before bringing it to the table. However, the best example of the type of service provided at Lago occurred at the next table over. When the diner requested fresh garlic with her sea bass entree, she was told the chef had none. But in just a few minutes, about the time it took to run over to one of the nearby Belagio restaurants, staff delivered a small bowl of the requested, chopped garlic! Promptly laden onto the Bass. We look forward to a return visit to Lago. Hopefully, we'll be lucky to have Carlos and Elmer give us their excellent service.",

After dinner, we realized the place to be next time would be the patio area so that one could hear the music synchronized with the fountains. I liked the house music in the interior, and it didn't bother me that it was not synchronized.   Service was excellent. Waiter was on top of selections and my allergies.   Had a lovely glass of wine and shared three tapas dishes (with two other friends) plenty of food. Would like dessert options that would be dairy-free and chocolate-free.   Very swanky bar. Nice decor in this Bellagio restaurant. Clean bathroom.",

If your parents come to visit, take them here.  Menu highlights include the absolute best dish I've eaten in 2015, the Polpo e Fregola al Nero.  It's two octopus steaks, perfectly seared with olive oil, squid ink and tiny Sardinian semolina balls - oh my goodness - we must all be doing something right in life to deserve to eat like this..  And the lamb ragu fusillioro, and the chicken liver crostini, and the scallop crudo...   I'm done typing - I'm headed back there now, I'll eat by myself at the bar tonight.",

The food at Lago was no better than good. We were a party of three and tried many of the dishes on the menu. You need to order several dishes per person since this is a small plate restaurant. Some of the dishes were better than others, however overall the meal was not what we were expecting given how great Julian Serrano's is at the Aria. The view is wonderful if you get a table near the window. The sound level is horrible. In order to hear anyone at your table you need to speak in a very loud voice.

    "text": "We were staying at Bellagio and just wanted to eat somewhere decent for lunch and came across Lago. The reviews and photos looked pretty good through Yelp so we made an appointment really quickly (the morning of, maybe about an hour earlier) and went for lunch.  The decor was not appealing (for me), but couldn't judge too much on this as most Vegas restaurants are the same caliber in design. One great thing was that they gave us seats along the windows, which overlooks Bellagio's famous fountain. The restaurant was not full, so all the customers had at least some kind of view of the water show!  The customer service was good, nothing bad nor absolutely amazing. But the food was just okay - nothing was really delicious. We got the Agnolotti di Vitello (veal ricotta stuffing) and Ravioli al Gamberi (shrimp) and both were mediocre. The agnolotti was at least interesting, but we didn't really fancy the taste much - though eating it with the dark sauce definitely helped. The ravioli was really just underwhelming with a simple tomato sauce - just super basic and the tomato sauce was too bland and didn't have much character for my taste.  All in all, it was just an okay restaurant - everything's overpriced in Vegas so I'm not necessarily looking down on the pasta prices because it's just a bit over the \"average\" we'd pay in LA (agnolotti being $17 and ravioli being $18).  The customers next to us got the pizza and that looked pretty good - though, pizza is tough to mess up!",

The menu offers two savory courses plus dessert and I thought the offerings were significantly more interesting than what Giada was serving for brunch across the street.  I started with cauliflower ricotta toast which had the perfect combo of cool ricotta and smoky flavor from the cauliflower.  My second course was Nonna's frittata (vegetables and mozzarella) which was perfectly crispy on the outside and light and fluffy inside.  The portions were sizable so I was stuffed by the time I went up to the dessert buffet but I found room for some delicious tarts and cookies.  There was a melted chocolate tower as well but the pastry chef's creations is where the magic is at.  The little lemon tart topped with a soft meringue and cream puff with streusel topping were so delicious I had to have a second of each.  Service was excellent and the gorgeous dining room gives you a magical view of the Bellagio fountains.",

We are from Vancouver and have so much excellent Italian food that this just didn't cut it. The gnocchi I thought was especially disappointing as the texture was mushy, my partner was disappointed in the price for value of the Caesar and the braised beef. We realize it's Vegas and things are expensive, but I hope the taste and texture would come somewhere close to the price.  The restaurant had a nice ambiance and the cocktails were killer, bartender was very nice and helpful.",

The grilled octopus over squid ink cous cous is a must have and the ceaser salad which a simple small serving of 3 lettuce bunches and anchovy dressing is refreshing. The vegetarian pappardelle is great for sharing as the vegetarian ragu does not disappoint.  Service: Dishes come out quick and the wait staff is super helpful on recommendations and how much is too much.   Ambiance: Well lit and decor is bright and colorful and if you are lucky enough to be seated by the window the Bellagio fountains are an added bonus.",

    "text": "The main draw of Lago is its view of the fountains and it did not disappoint. We were lucky enough to sit near the window and could easily watch each show. The restaurant would change the music at the start of each show to correspond with the display which was nice touch, though hearing my \"Heart Will Go On\" from Titanic three times during dinner was enough...  The food had some hits and misses. My table for two got 6 things to share: -A Crab meat, artichoke, and baby greens salad- it was good but no real wow factor. -The Alla Ricotta e Meile- Ricotta cheese and honey focaccia- SO GOOD. The ingredients were simple but delicious -The Risotto Al vino Rosso- This was a red wine risotto with melted burrata at the bottom. I have never tasted anything like this, it was rich and incredible. I'd go back just to eat this again -Costa Di Manzo- These short ribs had a great sauce. -Scaloppina di Vitello- The veal piccata had great flavor, but the meat was tough. -Creme Brule for dessert. I thought I was going to leave the meal hungry, but this dessert ensured that I did not.  Unfortunately, service here was severely lacking. We did not get out first order of drinks for about 35 minutes, other tables were seated after us and had their first round of dishes before we ordered our drinks. Often times our glasses were just sitting empty for 20-30 minutes before we were asked if we wanted another- a shame because this was a celebratory dinner and we wanted to get a little buzzed at least! The timing of the food delivery was off, no plates for long periods of times and then everything at once. At the end of the meal, we felt rushed to get out with them turning off the music, putting the lights on bright, and taking the bill from the table while we were still finishing (rude!). Why should we rush when the rest of the meal was so slow? Ultimately we would have ordered more food and drinks throughout the meal if the service had been faster, but we got sick of waiting.",

I continued to watch other parties being seated and after going up to the hostess to tell them that we have been waiting for a half an hour and I was ready to cancel my reservation they all of a sudden \"found\" 2 seats for us at the bar that I definitely did not want as I made a reservation to celebrate my mother's birthday and requested a seat at an actual table. Apparently it does not matter if you make a reservation at Lago as you will still be waiting just as long as someone who did not have a reservation. Glad I wasted my time.",

Hamachi has a bit of a kick to it (the oil), risotto was yummy! And husband loved the pasta with lamb ragout (fussillioro). Definitely recommend this spot! Requested and seated by the ginormous windows so had the additional benefit of the fountain show every 15 minutes. Great, attentive staff. Can get pricey fast though!

The food was quite tasty except for the lemon dessert which was too tart for me. I would return for dinner at some point to experience the fountains in the evening.",

We wanted to sit on the patio but were told people had that reserved for a long time.  The website said it was first come first serve there so we got there right when it opened.  Still where denied.  Our table was ok still could see most of the fountains.  The menu is small plates which was weird for my wife and I.  We are not to keen on sharing haha don't judge us.  But large groups with a bunch of people could be fun.  The food was ok wasn't the best I've had. Bit was kind of bland.  I read some other reviews that said the same thing, I just thought they were over critical.  All in all it was a good experience before our show.  Great atmosphere ok food.

We had a super nice waitress and the kitchen sent us a fantastic veggie pasta dish without cheese, veggie pizza without cheese and the Farro salad which is delicious. Those three were more than enough for two.  Everything was fresh and so good.  We sat outside with fountain views. Prices were reasonable considering the ambiance service and location! Thank you",

It's a great menu and I love the portions which encourage you to share a number of small dishes.  My favorites were the 7&7 potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles and the filetto which was cooked perfectly medium rare with delicious potatoes and asparagus.  The salads, cold cuts and chicken liver toasts were delicious as well.  Now the service.  Our server was polite, but kept getting distracted which cause one of our dishes to come out wrong.  When we tried to resolve it, one of the other servers had to help explain what we were trying to do (order the main filetto with sides instead of just the smaller filettino that was brought out instead).  Eventually it came out as ordered, but when we got the check, they charged us for each item individually instead which came up higher and we had to wait a while for them to resolve the check as well.  The server was polite during the whole interaction, but it was just made for a bit of an awkward dining experience.    I would probably try Lago again because I did enjoy the food, but probably not high on my list of place to return right away.  However, you will definitely enjoy the fountain show numerous times while in the dining room so plan on lots of people around you taking pictures during your dining experience.",

    "text": "I had a wonderful dinner at Lago. I made a reservation online and requested a table on the patio with view of the fountains. Based on what I read in other reviews, it seemed like a hit or miss to get a table on the patio so I was crossing my fingers for one. When we arrived to the restaurant, the hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait if we wanted a table outside. Totally fine with me.   When we were seated, I was so excited - we got the BEST table on the patio (the one in the middle with unobscured view of the fountains. Even my boyfriend, who never really cares for the view (while I'm obsessed lol) was mesmerized when we were seated. Every 15 minute, I was blown away by the view in front of us.  We were off to a good start and I ordered  the passionfruit mojito which was a hit. It was so good, just the right amount of alcohol, and it actually tasted passionfruit which is rare.   Our server told us about the menu and how it worked. You could order a few dishes at a time and eat, then order again. I LOVE this way of ordering. No stress to give up the table, we took our time and tried a few dishes at a time. Eating Italian food tapas style was perfect, as we love trying a lot of dishes but usually get so full.  Pizzette Al Cipollotto e speck - A small pizza with ricotta cheese, onion and Italian ham (3/5). My boyfriend and I agreed that this was the only dish we wouldn't order again. The dough was excellent, but the pizza itself was pretty dry and didn't stand out.   Cannelloni - Cannelloni filled with short rib and parmesan in a light tomato sauce (4/5). This was so freaking good. The short rib was perfectly seasoned and the sauce ... oh gosh. So good.   Gnocchi alla romana - Gnocchi in a creamy blue cheese sauce (5/5). I don't really like blue cheese sauce cause it's often too strong, but what was so great about this dish was that the blue cheese didn't overpower the dish but instead you could just taste a hint of it and the gnocchi just melted in your mouth as you took a bite. It was excellent.   Risotto al funghi e parmigiano - Risotto with mushroom and parmesan (4/5). A traditional dish, but wow so good. The risotto was perfectly al dente and the seasoning was on point. A must get if you love risotto.   Scaloppina di vitello - Veal in a lemon/buttery/white wine sauce and capers (5/5). This was the best of the best. The sauce was amazing and made me wish it was socially acceptable to lick the plate lol.   If you're a fan of Italian food, this is a must-try. I loved the concept of tapas style and the service was excellent. The view was incredible, but more importantly I loved the fact  that this restaurant didn't rely on their view to draw attraction but instead make sure that the food is top notch and that you leave wanting to come back.",

    "text": "We made 5:15pm reservation on Friday night and we were seated right away without waiting. There were several big groups so the noise level was high in the main hall area but luckily we were seated in a separate room.  Overall ambiance was bright, modern and comfortable. Service was prompt. Between two of us, we shared 5 tapas and 1 dessert. Everything we ordered was tasty and fresh, but the spicy baby shrimp was way spicier than expected. My husband enjoyed the heat but if you are not good at spicy food, you probably want to talk to your server before you order.  Like other restaurants in Bellagio, this place is not cheap. With couple of drinks, the bill will be easily go beyond $100 per person. However, if you are looking for a romantic restaurant for some good Italian food to share with your date, this place could be an option!",

Both very bland and the caesar being four romaine hearts with a very small amount of dressing. Next was the crab and artichoke which was good and features full cut artichoke hearts stuffed with crab, tomato and arugula with a nice oil sauce. The best dish of the night were the Roman gnocchi, more of a semolina cake, covered in a a delicious Gorgonzola sauce. If you're going there, I would strongly recommend these. Lastly we finished with a petit filet, which was nothing special and was more of a cap steak. For the price, ~$250, we definitely expected better food however the view is hard to beat anywhere on the strip.",

Both times our servers have been very helpful. We've always dined here in the style that we've just told them how many courses we want and they just keep bringing food for the table to share, similar to tapas style than meals. I'm not offering a 5th star just because the food itself was better the first time than the second time, but the experience is truly incredible. One of the most fun dinners I've had in Vegas!",

    "text": "If only yelp had a 2.5 star. Disappointing, even if it was tapas, it was ridiculously small and overly expensive. This is fine dining that you see in movies. I think we spent the most money here but ate the least. Everything was a tease, almost as if they had no entrees. Sampling size.   The Cesar salad was a joke. It's as if someone was finished peeling off the lettuce and gave us the butt end and cut it in half. The gnocchis were good, very few tho, but flavoring was good. The squid with the tortilla chips was okay. Really bland, not that much flavoring but you can taste the freshness of the seafood but it was a weird combination with the paste on the side. Beef was pretty moist, the best dish of the night, but it's pretty average, something u can find at most places . The salmon, I don't remember much from it. The half cup of pasta was really good. Overall no. I cannot believe the only thing I enjoyed was watching the water show. Food was not rememberable, only thing I remember was it being way too small for $$$$$. We went to Earl's sandwiches right after.",

We had a pizza, ravioli, hamachi dish, salmon dish and crab/ artichoke dish. All super good. I highly recommend. It is a bit pricey, but worth it to me.",

We had the ahi tuna with the orange segments.  Very fresh and subtle. Delicious. The salmon with the caper was also interesting. Also fresh, but more savory.  Crabmeat Salad.  Crab with quinoa and baby greens. Tastes as fancy as it sounds. Again, it was fresh and luxurious.  Gnocchi.  We had both kinds, the plain with blue cheese and the potato ones with lobster. Both were delicious, especially the latter. It was such a good pairing.   Crostini. Very simple dish, with tomatoes and basil. Kind of expensive for what it is.  Deli Meats. There was prosciutto, salami, and bresaola. Good but nothing special. Maybe I'm not enough of a connoisseur to be able to distinguish between this and what I can get at Trader Joe's.  Lamb Ragu Pasta. I don't generally like lamb, but this was quite good. It was rich but I didn't taste any gaminess.   Beef tenderloin. This was amazing. Cooked just right. It was tender and flavorful.  The food was amazingly good and amazingly expensive. It's not like I can afford to eat here all the time, but once or maybe twice is nice!",

I have to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the cheese plate, mainly because one of the cheeses was so hard that when my husband tried to cut it, his knife flew out of his hand, and cheese was catapulted from the plate, bypassing my face and landing on the floor.  While funny, that was was an otherwise decent piece of cheese we could have eaten!  LOL.  We also ordered the meatballs, which were super yummy!!

The most rewarding meal for my expanding gut was the Osso Busco! Best Veal Shank my mouth has tasted.  Early May, the same group decided on a road trip and we took a pit stop for the Bellagio fountains and to top off our lingering cravings of Pesce al cartoccio and the Pesce intero. Amazing dishes, but I am still a great fan of the Osso Busco! Got to love the Lago experience at the Bellagio. Viva Las Vegas!",

If you are going to charge premium prices then I expect premium service and delicious cold martinis.  We had a great experience here for lunch last year so we returned for dinner with clients but there is too much competition in this town for this amature hour bush league stuff.    How about a pleasant demeanor?  How about a delicious drink?    We received neither at Lago.",

Everything prepared wonderfully and creatively. The menu is very diverse and creative as well. The duck was exceptional.  The service was fast, friendly and accurate.  The views are the best of the strip in my opinion.   You just can't beat dinner here if you want a great Vegas experience.      If you have not been here, you must come at least once. You will be very happy you did. It's a gorgeous restaurant with gorgeous views!  I will be back and would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a great time in Vegas!",

The quality of food, view, and service made it a top notch restaurant on the strip for us, and we will certainly return.  We ordered from the prix fix lunch menu (extremely economical): Caprese salad Seafood salad Housemade meatballs Four cheese spinach lasagna Lemon bar with limoncello Tiramisu  The ingredients used were extremely fresh - the mozzarella is handpulled in house and the produce was bright, vibrant, and delicious. The seafood salad (with an incredibly bright grapefruit vinaigrette that paired very well) was really packed with fresh seafood. I saw clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, scallops, and crab meat, and it was all perfectly cooked and chilled.  The marinara sauce is the best I've ever eaten, and the meatballs and lasagna were really delicious. The concept is small plates to share, so you get several bites of each item, but you leave feeling very full. It allowed us to savor the food a little more, and it was a real treat.  My husband's lemon bar was SO good, and the limoncello sorbet was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. It also had meringues and mango sauce, which complemented it all very well. The tiramisu was oversoaked in espresso (in my opinion, and that's largely a palate thing) leaving it too bitter, and the white chocolate ... quenelle ... was viscous and frankly, difficult to eat. The cappuccino ice cream, however, was really delicious.  All in all, this is a must for any visitor to the strip. If you go for a late lunch or early dinner, you'll even get fountain view seating and can watch each show from the balcony.",

My wife and I visit Vegas at least several times per year, always reside at Bellagio, and dine almost exclusively at Lago, we love it that much.  General Manager Albert Najem is always the most gracious of hosts, ensuring each of our visits is enjoyable and memorable.  It's True, this is at times a very busy and boisterous establishment, which in my opinion, adds to the overall dining experience.  Few restaurants I'm aware of could handle this volume all the while maintaining very high quality product and service.  We've never received inadequate service here, and are especially partial to Servers Denise, Jennifer, and Marcello.  All three have award winning personalities and never fail to lavish us with truly flawless service.  I should also laud the impeccable wine service from Lead Sommelier Jeffrey Bencus.  While we've never actually encountered a disappointing dish here, a few of our personal favorites are unequivocally the Cannelloni, Linguine Al Pesto, Risotto Di Fruiti Mare, Salmon, and...the Cannoli is absolutely to die for.  We also dined last week at Picasso, which was profoundly exceptional, and I ventured over to the Aria one day for a quick bite (and wine) at Julian Serrano Tapas.  My sole ambition for flying from Wash. DC to Vegas several times per year, is to patronize Lago.  Julian Serrano's hands have truly been touched by God!  ST",

Our reservation was for 7:30, we got sat around 8 which I'm fine with since we were about 7 minutes late and I work in a restaurant so I understand how it is. It was our two year anniversary and I've never been to a fancy nice restaurant.   Our server, John, was amazing. Huge props to him for handing many tables at once. He still stopped by after we got every dish within two minutes which is a huge thing for my boyfriend and I (2 bites 2 minutes rule encase anything was messed up), got us drinks when he noticed they were half way done, and he basically suggested every plate that we had! He's very good at what he does. I'll definitely ask for him when we come back.  Our food came out way quicker than I expected. Nothing took more than 15 minutes which was amazing! The first things we had were the brasato d'anatra and the ravioli al gamberi. The brasato.. I was literally slapped in the face with how phenomenal it was. Honestly no words can describe the flavors I had in my mouth. So many different flavors and it was so delicious. Pretty creamy too and it was just so delightful to eat we almost ordered it again. The ravioli was the worst thing we had there yet it was still amazing. Then we ordered the fusillioro. This was my second favorite plate that we had. I would trust these cooks with my life if it was based off this cooking. The risotto di fruti mare was amazing too. The clams were seasoned amazingly, scallops cooked to perfection, lobster was very tender, not a bad thing about this dish. John recommended an amazing dessert that he paid for since it was a celebration. It was the giandujotto. It's not too heavy like most desserts. You can easily compare it to a ferrero rocher.   Our tab was $99.99. Good pricing for such an amazing meal and the location!  We saw about 4 water shows in total. Extremely gorgeous.   I'm a very happy person right now. Thank you Lago for making our anniversary dinner amazing. We WILL be back. (:",

We had resort credit we had to use up from M life, and Lago really was visually appealing, so we wanted to compare the two.  We arrived around 1120 pm. They close at Midnight, and our server Ariaena was pushing to get us to order. She wasnt the most friendly or informative, so of the two, service was better at JS Tapas.  We ordered a variety of dishes. Brusch Pomodora ( Brusetta ) was good, and at 8$ it was the least costly thing ordered.  We also had Salsiccia pizza which is a very small size. It was both very dry( crust ) and way too greasy 17$  Speaking of small, the Calamaro Rioieno was 4 teeny tiny bite size pieces.   The ceaser salad was a small head of romaine cut into 4 and sprinkled with cheese and dressing.  The steak was small but very tasty. It was the best thing we had.   We had a few other items, one drink each, and the total was close to 200$  I wasn't shocked since I expected it after eating at his other place, but unless it was comped again, I wouldn't return.   On another note - this was the night that The Bellagio's Rolex store (in the main lobby) got robbed by a guy wearing a pig mask ( and others in a cat & a panda mask too ).   When they used sledge hammers to smash out the glass , people thought it was gun shots...  It caused SO much panic and chaos as people ran and some hid under tables. There were reports of a live shooter and we assumed it was a shooting at the Nightclub. It wasn't until much later we discovered what was going on.   Cops everywhere, we got locked down in the casino, outside gridlocked traffic and cops with machine guns. It was a crazy night. Had we not gone to dine here we would of missed it all !!",

We were unsure about the place at the beginning but the hostess made us feel welcome and comfortable right from the beginning as she lead us to one of the best tables in the house. Our window seat with a view of the world famous Bellagio Fountain and the Paris Hotel was very impressive.   Not being totally familiar with the tapas style of dining, our waiter easily, politely and throughly walked us through the process. After cruising the wine list, we ordered our wine with the sommelier who broke the ice and wine ordering business when the cork broke in the bottle we ordered. We all got a good laugh out of that. Oh, and the Pinot Noir was an excellent choice.  We ordered a little bit of everything...tapas style. Cold seafood, pasta, more seafood, meatballs and desert. No complaints whatsoever. None.  The couple sitting next to us was celebrating a birthday and we offered to take their picture with the incredible view behind them. They reciprocated taking our picture. Fine people from Toronto they were.  We hated to leave Lago but if you go, this is a dress-up place for ladies and gentlemen. This is also not a cheap place but, you will get great food, beverage, atmosphere that is incomparable and service that is really commensurate with the costs. This was a great experience.",

It's hard to say which pasta was best, but I might say lamb ragu.  Although the clam pasta was also amazing in its own way. We loved the pasta so much we skipped the entrees. Well, we even skipped desert and ordered spaghetti and meat balls as desert. I think you gather by now we loved our pasta at Lago.   We also tried the octopus, which was tender. We liked the octopus, but we didn't love it to the point that we'd order it again.    Otherwise we were pretty happy with our last minute decision to try Lago.

When the fountain went off we couldn't see it because every restaurant patron stood right in front of our table and blocked our view.   Lobster Gnocchi was good but came out cold.  Not the best.  Disappointing.",

The Creme Brulee is almost as incredible as the front row view of the Bellagio water show. I would highly recommend calling ahead of time to make reservations for the scenic view. We did not eat dinner, however, the menu is based off of Italian tapas and few main courses that are meant to be shared. I would definitely recommend for anyone staying on the strip.",

My group of 4 stopped by around 3pm and the main dining room wasn't open yet, so we sat by the bar area away from the windows. But since the patio was completely empty, we were still able to go out and take a few photos. Note to self: must make a reservation for their outdoor seating in the near future.  We all started with the Lago Cocktail - a pretty blue martini, a round ice cube with a flower frozen in the middle, and gold dust sprinkled on top. Forgot what alcohol was in it, but the bartender poured really heavy.   For food, we shared the beef carpaccio and salmon crudo. One of my friends never tried raw beef or fish before, and she ended up loving the carpaccio. The salmon, however, was just okay. It only came with 4 tiny pieces and was a whooping $18. I'm all for expensive food that's worth it, but this was the one miss of the restaurant, so I have to dock off 1 star. Other than that, I'll be back to try their dinner menu next to the dancing fountains!",

    "text": "Brunch Review  We had a 10:30am reservation on a Sunday for brunch. We were seated on the outside patio.  The hostess was very nice. Remembered us and sat us right away.  Food and drink: Mac Carbonara - 3 stars - nothing wrong with the dish but also nothing special about it. Would order it again Raviolone - 4 stars - as you cut into the ravioli the egg flowed out in a beautiful liquid pool.  The pasta was perfectly al dente. The sauce was very rich and a little heavy handed. I would do more of a drizzle of the sauce. Italian Sausage Fried Egg Burger - 2 stars - overcooked a bit EggPlant Parmesan Benedict - 2 stars - no flavor Peach Bellini - 2 stars - just ok.   Bloody Mary - 3 stars - this is from a Bloody Mary critic though.  Could use worcestershire, celery salt and horseradish.  Added garnishes of pickle peppers and a bacon strip would be lovely.  Service - 1 star Ricky was our server. He was very nice however seemed a bit frazzled. My drink did not come out for quite a while however they did end up comping it. We have been there for an hour and only had one course and of the three course brunch. We stayed another 15 minutes and then left as we had a plane to catch.  We asked several time for our next course but it did not come until we were literally getting out of our chairs.  We were charged for the entire brunch.    Ambiance - 3 stars This restaurant has a bit of a modern vibe. The music was club music which was a bit much for brunch so minus one start. We really enjoyed the view from the patio and watching the fountains was amazing.  The food was just mediocre and the service was not good.  There is much room for improvement.  I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch.  Very disappointing give that it is in the Bellagio.",

I loved the crisp, modern feel of the restaurant design and color scheme. I love the small plate concept for high end italian. We were able to try several great dishes as a group.   I started with the tonno (ahi tuna with orange segments) and a caesar salad. Both were good, not amazing, but good. My friends had the Alla ricotta e miele (ricotta cheese with honey) per recommendation, and really like that quite a bit.   We all got various homemade pastas for our entrees. Now these were fantastic. The highlight of the night though, was the pasta special which was a long thick noodle pasta with truffle oil, and then black shaved truffles over the top. It was LOADED with truffles, and the dish was out of this world! So was the price:-) but that was to be expected. I will go back just for this dish!  We shared desserts, which were as good as they were beautiful. A great way to end a lovely meal and view.",

    "text": "And the winner is Moonlight!  Wait!  That's a mistake!  The Real winner is, La La Lago!  Located inside the Bellagio Hotel near the North Entrance.  This chic Italian inspired restaurant, for me, is one of the all around best restaurants I've experienced in Vegas.  Lago is deserving of all 5 stars.   One for its Service.  A star-studded performance by the staff on each and every one of my visits.  Always pleasant, always attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu(what a concept huh).     One for its remarkable Visuals.  Lago decor is one of beauty.  This sleek stylish design with its breathtaking panoramic center-stage views of the Fountains of Bellagio, will surely elevate the level of your experience.  They do have a patio seating area that's even more impressive.    One for its uplifting Spirits.  Innovation in creating the most refreshing and flavorful PASSIONFRUIT MOJITO I ever had.  The smooth operator CARAJILLO with its Licor 43 & Espresso combo making it a perfect after dinner drink.  This drink's companion is a dark chocolate spoon, meant for stirring licking or nibbling, whichever satisfies your current mood.  Top billing on the Lago Mixology Collection is LAGO COCKTAIL.  A unique and impressive cast of ingredients which you can have made sweet or spicy.  I've only tried and enjoyed the spicy, where Cayenne pepper was used.  Also, making a special cameo appearance by the ROSSO BELLINI, what a diva.     One for its exceptional Food.  Anyone who knows me, knows I love a table full of food.  Lago has some of the most fascinating tapas.  Thanks to Julian Serrano's creations, my table has always been full.  Starting off with the complimentary OLIVE BREAD, which I must say was FUC'n amazing.  Want raw beef?  If you do and don't mind it thin, then you'll love CARPACCIO DI MANZO...tender, moist and flavorful.  Succulent pieces of meat you'll want to put in your mouth.  The SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (veal piccata) thin, tender and flavorful as well.  For you Seafood lovers.  The TOTANO RIPIENO (grilled shrimp stuffed squid), SALMONE (both sashimi & cooked), POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO (octopus with squid ink cous cous), HAMACHI (yellowtail), CAPASANTA (scallops, blood orange, and pistachio), are equally spectacular in their own way.  The CAPASANTA ALLA PUTANESCA (scallops, tomatoes, boquerone sauce) were FUC'n amazing!  The '7 & 7' was dish was orgasmic, for you food porn lovers.  This extremely tender Potato Gnocchi with the Lobster Knuckles will surely please your senses.  Look at the pic.  I'm sure you'll wanna taste.       One final star goes to Lago's drop dead gorgeous Desserts.  I was not only impressed with the taste, but also the plating and composition of ingredients of the desserts I've tried already.  The AMALFI is a Lemon Tart with Limoncello Sorbet and Passion Fruit coils.  The MATTONELLA AL CICCOLATO is a Flourless Chocolate Sponge Cake with Chocolate Ganache, Chocolate gelato, and Chocolate sauce.  Even though the CREME BRULEE has a different consistency, texture, taste, I still found it to be perfect for my palate.  I enjoyed the TIRAMISU which was presented differently, deserving of an honorable mention.  Finishing this sweet list off with a happy ending, GIADUIOTTO, My Favorite.     The Staff, Visuals, Cocktails, Food, and Desserts, all working in unison, for a complete climatic dinning experience, and all deserving of the 'Red Carpet' treatment.   I will be returning for more happy endings!",

We came at opening, hardly a soul in the restaurant, yet trying to flag down someone to ask for salt and pepper was difficult. To be honest, the food was pretty good, but below expectations for the price. I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 15 years and am pretty understanding when it comes to the staff, but this was a pretty shitty experience. Honestly, I've had better food and service in a hole in the wall restaurant than I did here. With fine dining prices, you expect a certain expectation & we were underwhelmed at best. To top the night off we ordered coffee and cream. The bus boy brought us milk. I politely asked if I could get cream, because I dislike milk. The server replied, \"if he brought you milk, it's probably because he couldn't find cream.\"  I'm sorry, what??? It's only two hours into the restaurant being open and your out of cream? What a bullshit excuse. Thanks, but no thanks. We won't be coming back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend planned an amazing day in Vegas for my 30th birthday and picked Lago for dinner which I've been wanting to visit for a while. You cannot beat the amazing views. We decided to go with a table outside even though it was still pretty hot but the mist from the Bellagio fountain cools you off! It was great seeing a behind the scene view of the fountain.   Service was amazing the whole night. Our server helped us make great menu choices and everyone was very attentive. Our server asked if we were celebrating anything specific and he was nice enough to have them put a very cute \"Happy Birthday\" white chocolate plaque onto our dessert. Such a nice touch! This is an Italian tapas restaurant so parties of 2 are typically told to order at least 4 dishes to share. Everything came out really fast so you can also play around and order more if need be.  We started with the Carpaccio Di Manzo. Very refreshing on this hot night and great quality.  For dinner, we shared the: Fusillioro, corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo, lamb ragu, spuma di ricotta. Very hearty and actually a bit filling for a small amount of pasta. One of my favorite dishes. Carciofi E Granchio, crab meat, artichoke, parmesan, arugula dressing. My favorite dish of the night, which was shocking because this was more like a salad! Lots of delicious sweet crab and the artichoke was amazing! Everything paired so well together.  7 & 7, potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles, salsa di crostacei. I was a bit disappointed with this dish. This dish is very small and the sauce seemed to lack flavor. I would have preferred all of the components mixed together instead of everything plated separate on the plate.   I was very pleased with our visit and it was a great dinner before our show. The prices are a bit steep but expected of course. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Lago for brunch. Made reservations in advance and were seated right away. Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu and providing recommendations. (He could have been a bit more attentive in my opinion, however he was super friendly and nice so I won't be docking any stars.)  Brunch consists of a 3 course meal. You select the first two courses from a list and the 3rd course is buffet style desserts and fruit which you can get at any time (and go for seconds if you'd like). They also bring a plate of small treats as an appetizer. For our first course we had the truffle ravioli with egg which was extremely flavorful and delicious. For the second course I had the lobster eggs Benedict and my husband had the meat lasagna with poached eggs. Both were perfectly paired pasta and egg dishes. Very very tastefully prepared.   We enjoyed our brunch all while looking out at the Bellagio fountains as they played I believe every 15 or 20 minutes.   Overall, amazing food, modern ambiance, nice views, friendly staff, great first experience!! Will 100% visit again!!!",

We ordered the Seafood Risotto, Slow braised short rib, and lamb pasta dish that was recommended from our server. The table service was on point!   The only thing that would've exceeded our experience is if they gave us a free dessert for our anniversary, which many restaurants traditionally do, but I guess it's not the policy for this restaurant to do so. But that's just a trivial point. We had a great experience at this restaurant!",

    "text": "4.5 stars! Lago has elegant contemporary decor with gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountains. If you want a table right by the window or in the first row of the patio by the fountains, you need to have a small party of 2 or 3 as only small tables are in these areas.   We sat in the patio which was nicely heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We enjoyed watching the fountain performance with our tasty dinner.   Here are the dishes we devoured:  CAPRESE: Must get if you like soft cheese. Simple dish showcases the freshness of the cheese and the tomatoes.   MARGHERITA: Personal sized pizza with thin crust was a favorite.   ALLA RICOTTA E MIELE: Cheese with honey toast is good for desert too. I don't fancy goat/sheep cheese, and I think this is was one of those but the rest of our group enjoyed it.   CAPASANTA: scallops were yummy!  RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO: mushroom risotto was my favorite dish of the night. Highly recommended!  7 & 7: lobster and gnocchi were OK; I think the gnocchi have some type of cheese that I didn't care for, but other people didn't mind. The lobster seemed a tad overcooked.   SPAGHETTI DI FRUTI DI MARE: a big hard to eat since the spaghetti is thicker, but we loved this dish.   POLPO E FREGOLA AL NERO: grilled octopus is a highlight too.   BRASATO D'ANATRA: Braised shredded duck with creamy polenta is a nice rich dish.   Branzino sea bass: Must get! The fish is perfectly cooked with the skin crispy and the fish moist.   Dessert selection may change, but the tiramisu is excellent. The creme brulee has a good caramelized crust, but I didn't like the custard. It seems to have a lemon or orange taste while I usually opt for a vanilla bean flavor.   Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the memorable dining experience with friendly service, delicious food, and stellar fountain views. Highly recommended! It is also kids friendly with high chairs available unlike other fancier restaurants in Bellagio such as Picasso and Prime that only allows children above 5 years old. The food service is also fast so it's a good choice if you have a show to catch too.",

From the patio, you get the prime seating for the fountains + you get to enjoy the beautiful evening weather.  The food is so good! There isn't anything I didn't like. The pizza is small, but good. The gnocchi is little fluffy clouds of yumminess. And the red wine risotto has really interesting flavor, I would recommend trying it. We also had a variety of desserts. Each were good, but my personal favorite was the Creme Brulee.   I will come back here the next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "My lovely wife and I were here for a concert and decide to try Lago which we have been wanting to to try for some time.   Located in the Bellagio resort on the water facing the fountains. We had a lovely view of the fountains which we requested. Even 3 days before we arrived we were able to get this spot because we were willing to go early. We made a reservation at 5:15 PM.   Amazing views from the balcony and the weather was so mild. The view was spectacular from our table. The food was equal or the view.   The style here is what the waiter called: Italian tapas. Small plates.  We started with: The Cesare which was made with baby romaine, anchovy dressing and ciabatta croutons. Delicious.  Next we had Bruschetta al Pomodoro which was tomatoes, basil, garlic oil. Delicious. Could taste every ingredient.   Next was Patate al Forno, roasted potatoes, rosemary. Good, not spatacular. Just roasted fingerling potatoes. Nothing special.  Next was Polenta al Formaggio which was 3 cheeses soft polenta. WOW, best polenta I have ever eaten. Soft, creamy, cheesy; Outstanding. We should have ordered 2 of these. Sooo oh good.  Next was Cannelloni comprised of pulled short ribs, parmesan fonduta, tomato sauce. Ok, but not that great. The short ribs was a sort of puree and felt strange in my mouth. Not that flavorful. I would pass.  Last was 7 & 7 which was potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles, salsa di crostacei. Outstanding. Soft pillows of gnocchi with succulent lobster knuckles. So good.  We skipped desert as we were so full. I will be honest the desert did not look that great, but maybe it was because we were so full  Service was great 5/5 and Food was good 5/5. Overall 5/5. Amazing meal with amazing views!",

Overall service was good.   I would return but likely not for the food just drinks.

There were four of us, so when there were plates that would only have three pieces of something, the server suggested he include an extra piece so we could all enjoy the item without having to cut something in half, or god forbid share. An upsell, but a thoughtful one so no one got shorted any of the culinary goodness. We ordered 8 or 9 tapas, and the food comes out in waves, and it was brought out in a manner that made very good sense. Plating was impressive, service attentive, and fun to see the fountains doing their thing throughout dinner. Amazing cannoli for dessert.",

I thought it was nothing no big deal. Out of nowhere, I instantly felt like sh*t. Ran to the nearest restroom, I threw up and was on the toilet for an hour. We were still inside Bellagio, didn't even make it out of the hotel yet and my stomach was killing me. I wanted to cry so bad. We had to cancel the rest of our plans for the night and went to bed early. This experience is not worth what i paid for. My stomach is still feeling weird as I am writing this review the next morning in bed. Hopefully no one has to experience this like I did.",

The staff was so sweet and accommodating. The views were gorgeous. The food was great.

    "text": "Lago is located in the heart of the Bellagio with excellent views of the fountains. We made last minute reservations for a Monday night after eating at Julian Serrano's Tapas restaurant the night before (which was amazing!), but when we arrived, the place was mostly empty. The hostess took a few minutes to seat us, and once she did, a server didn't show up for at least 5-7 minutes. Once someone came to take our drink order, someone else came by two minutes later to take our drink order again...which was very confusing and a bit frustrating. Many employees were standing around, and the organization of the place seemed a bit off.   The food is of course tapas style, which we thought was very fun for Italian food, since I'm always indecisive about main courses.  We split: - caprese: great tomatoes - cesare: super solid - malloreddos: our least favorite dish; it kind of felt like hamburger helper... - gnocchi alla romana: yummy, yummy, & yummy; get this one! - branzino livornese: good, not great  For dessert, we split the tiramisu, which was amazing, and the lemon tart, which was pretty good. We did feel a bit rushed with our check, as it was brought with our dessert...not a very respectful practice in such a nice restaurant...  Overall, Lago was a perfectly good experience; the food was good, but the service and organization was lacking.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to leave a review for this place for awhile and have been on the fence about it. I came here for the first time with my cousin this past summer (May 2018) for an early dinner/lunch. We came here before when it was another restaurant, the Olive, but were sad to see it was gone. We decided to still dine here because the view is amazing and the prices looked reasonable, so I made a reservation online. We arrived on time and thankfully it wasn't packed so we got a seat outside right by the water. Our server was super sweet and we had a hard time figuring out what to order and he helped us. In the end my cousin and I ordered the same thing which was one of their pastas. The server recommended adding truffle and said it was a little more, but worth it. We said okay and when our dish arrived he said oh the chef must have felt generous and gave you a good amount of truffle. It seemed like a normal amount to me. We also ordered an appetizer, the tuna tartar. It looked good, but lacked in flavor unfortunately.   I honestly felt uncomfortable here because the workers dressed in suits kept walking outside and standing around the door staring at you and whispering around. It was a weird vibe. What also made the experience suck was the fountains never turned on, so we never got to see the water show. Everyone outside was really upset about this. We were getting ready to leave and got the check and were shocked to see the total. I knew truffle was going to be more, but our server never said $50 more! I paid more for a few flakes of truffle than for my whole meal. My cousin and I were really upset about this and wish we were warned about the price beforehand since it's something the server recommended. If the fountains at least worked that day I'd say screw it we paid for the view, but that didn't even happen. I'm sure that's out of their control, but please at least give warning to people for add ons if they're going to cost more than the dish. That really pushed me away from wanting to dine here again.",

Make sure you make reservation and request window seat, because the view is fabulous!  The selection of menu is limited, and price is reasonable.

We chose to let the waiter decide a menu for us and everything I had was at least \"good\" and many things were absolutely amazing.   Personal favorites - pasta with lamb ragu, shirt rib filled ravioli (so, so good), a beautiful charcuterie plate and fresh burrata served with heirloom tomatoes. Expect hefty prices - most plates are $20ish and they recommend 3 per person. The wine list is both expensive and extensive with most glasses in the upper teens on the low end.   Service was good, considering they were absolutely slammed with huge parties AND backed up on reservations. I'm glad I got to eat here and even more glad I didn't have to pick up the tab!",

    "text": "We celebrated our 5-year wedding anniversary at Lago this past Saturday.  I had very high expectations from this restaurant and chef and found it to be good, not great.  Firstly, we made a request for outdoor patio seating and we did not receive it.  I understand that the patio is small and that outdoor seating is not guaranteed, but it is unfortunate when a couple checks in with the hostess after us, admits they are 30 mins late to their reservation without calling, apologies for their mistake, and then get rewarded with super nice patio seating.    Inside, the restaurant was absolutely full and buzzing with loud dance music.  If you are looking for a romantic ambiance, this is not it.  People are dressed very casually and there doesn't seem to be a dress code.  Many were in shorts and flip flops, and the guy sitting next to us looked like he just came back from a run, decked out in his jogging gear.  Awkward!   Service was the lowest point.  Our waiter was hurried, unfriendly, the whole evening felt rushed, and very rarely came to check on us.  He did give us the helpful tip that we should order as we saw necessary as the plates came out tapas-style.  All in all, he wasn't very friendly.   The food was also good, not great.  My favorite was the cannelloni short ribs and the spec pizza.  The rapini was very plain and the ricotta with honey can very easily be replicated at home.  Just a piece of focaccia with honey and cheese smeared on top.    All in all, a good restaurant but if you are looking for something really exquisite to celebrate a very special occasion, this may not be your first choice.",

The food is fantastic and so are the cocktails. I recommend trying the bed carpaccio and the Picasso cocktail.   I'll definitely be back here again.   Only let down was the iPads they use to show you dessert. Whilst this is a very cool method, we had a late dinner (10:30PM) and by the time we wanted to order dessert the iPad on our table ran out of battery. The waiter apologised and replaced it with another iPad, that again, ran out of battery as soon as he left our table. We took it as a sign not to have dessert and left it at that.",

Everyone from the hostess who greeted us, the server, and the general manager, Albert were very warm, accommodating and hospitable. Albert came to the table and asked us how everything was, you don't get that personal touch from a manager in many places and it made a big difference. My friends and I had a great time at Lago brunch and I'll definitely visit there soon again!",

Boyfriend and I ordered brunch, which was a choice of many different items. First we ordered coffee which came in a tiny cup and was lukewarm (diner quality). He got the Mac carbonara, which he later compared to Chef Boyardee, and lobster Benedict, which was ok. I got the shredded salmon pesto salad, which was fine but the temperature contrast of the hot salmon and room temperature salad to the clearly refrigerated apple was a little odd, and the Italian sausage burger which was fine. Dessert buffet was a major letdown - tasted like pastries from a middle tier grocery store (think mass produced). Strawberries in chocolate fountain were good, though. Best part of brunch was by far the Bloody Mary, which was extra spicy and actually quite good. On the flip side, it was fun to sit outside and watch the fountains.   Overall, NOT worth $90 per person.",

    "text": "So happy to have this new spot at Bellagio! Took over Circo which was also Italian. Chef Serrano brings in his own taste for Italian and love for Mediterranean food and basically made a wonderful new addition to the Bellagio property!! Love that you can often see the Chef at his restaurants (Picasso and JS), always appreciate seeing that and think it's rare these days to have the actual Chef present! Go Chef!!   In love love love with the octopus with risotto and basically all of the pasta dishes-yes, all!! I recommend going with a group so you can order everything!! I'm excited!! Portions are small and I feel are priced appropriately for the quality, taste, and presentation of the food, not to mention the gorgeous fountain view! Crab and Farro salad, so light, fresh and perfectly flavored. Being Asian I will call the crudo dishes sashimi :-)---salmon sashimi & scallop sashimi = Oyshi DOPE. Gnocchi with lobster knuckles, I mean... Wow. But my hands down fave that I will order over, and over, and over again was the squid ink pasta with lobster! Please see photo I posted. It was so wonderful!  Enjoyed the lamb and veal too, both so tender and magical to my taste buds!   Finished this magical evening with a drink which I wish I could remember the name but it had a magical ball with magical juice and it literally exploded in your mouth... It's served in a martini glass with a scoop of sorbet that they pour prosecco over! Bravo!!   Ok so I basically support Lago, a lot! Enjoy! :-)  P.s... Dear Bellagio-Lago-Chef, please open for lunch!!",

    "text": "Lago is a recent addition to the dining choices at Bellagio. Situated facing the lake it provides a number of great views. Patio dining situates you directly next to the water show. The interior decor is beautiful. The white walls provide a bright space highlighted by the wall decorations and accented by the dark multi color flooring.  Our server Brian was helpful in explaining the menu and attentive in following up though out the meal. The menu provides a choice of many small plates with an option to choose a large main course. Our starter was the bruschetta which was a pretty standard arrangement. I would have preferred less crunch in the bread and more garlic. The choice of sides were roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary and a combination of green and white asparagus. The potatoes were shaped like small slices of bread and cooked perfectly. The asparagus was outstanding, cooked al dente and topped with melted Parmesan cheese. The two entrees of choice were a 4 oz. filet of beef tenderloin and a plate of veal piccata. The filet was cooked as ordered and served with a rich veal reduction on the side, juicy and tender. The veal consisted of 3 perfectly cooked pieces in a wonderful caper sauce. Brian suggested that we order 3 to 4 small plates and his recommendation was spot on, just the right amount of food. The finale was tiramisu. The Lago rendition is served with a side of ice cream that melds perfectly with the cake. The desert was exactly to our liking.  Looks like winner for chef Julian Serrano with a excellent interpretation of Italian dining.",

Drinks at the bar were excellent- cucumber cocktail and a Sicilian gin/tonic.   The place has an upbeat mood along with efficient service. The waiters will recommend some shared small plates so take their lead but order as they come out as you may over order if all up front.  Everything was very good and portion sizes were fine. Especially liked the short ribs, pasta, veal and assorted Pizza's.   Suggest trying different deserts (were out of cannoli) - especially liked the light fruit panna cotta and lemon desert. Wine list was also diverse and although priced on the higher end, you should be able to find a nice reasonably priced wine - IL Borro super Tuscan 2012 was excellent.   Fun place especially with a group...",

Modern yet simple. It makes the view the focal point.  *The food 4/5: tapas style Italian dishes. They had some larger dishes but we opted for 2 smaller ones each to try a variety. Everything was delicious:  -Margherita pizza: delicious thin crust with fresh ingredients. So good. -Octopus with squid ink couscous: my favorite. Very tasty although you have to eat it right away because we let it sit for a while and the couscous tasted a bit more oily afterwards. -Duck with polenta: tasted more like short rib but still very good and soft. -Kobe beef: super tender although a bit tiny. Even the potatoes were bigger. -7&7 gnocchi and lobster: just what you'd expect -Mussels: they give you plenty of bread so you can soak them in their tasty broth -Raspberry mousse dessert  *The cocktails 5/5: they were the highlight of the meal. Not only did they look beautiful with creative elements but they tasted good and were strong. Mine had prosecco and juice and was topped with a beautiful sugar crown that tasted like cotton candy and a gold raspberry  Prices were not bad but portions were small so you need at least 2 dishes to get full.  Service was great. Totally recommend!",

Food was very clean and light with robust flavors.",

Who says this to a customer other than a manager who does not care. Instead wanted to hear that he will do everything in their power to make sure to protect other customers from this happening.

    "text": "We loved everything about this restaurant! It was our last day in Vegas and my husband was in the mood for Italian.  I wanted something outdoors to enjoy our last bit of warm weather.  Lago was our answer. We visited during lunch where they have a prix fix menu for $28 per person.  This includes your choice of appetizer, entree and dessert.  The restaurant is more tapas style so our server warned us about size, but we found the portions to be plenty, especially with the three courses. We were seated pretty quickly at a nice outdoor table.  The place settings have logo cloth napkins and stylish plates. Your server will ask if you want sparkling or still water.  If you don't request tap water you'll end up paying $8 for a bottle of Fiji water.   We ordered the tuna appetizer.  It was a different take on ahi style tuna with a refreshing citrus flavor.  It was, however, just four small pieces, so pricey for what you got. For appetizers we got the seafood salad and the antipasto.  Both were nicely presented with larger portions than we were expecting.  The seafood was fresh and refreshing.  I just wish there had been more lobster (but who wouldn't want more lobster).  The antipasto was arranged with meat on the bottom around the center with cheese and olives in the center.  There was enough for both of us to try some.  My husband had the lasagna as his entree.  It has a unique look (being mostly green) but with every bite he took, there was mention of just how good the lasagna was.  I had the beef carpaccio.  It was pretty standard carpaccio but very tasty.  It was served with bread crisps. Desserts were almost too pretty to eat!  There were two choices so we got one of each. A lemon cake with a lemon sorbet and a chocolate cake with chocolate gelato.  A perfect way to end such a lovely meal. Courses were spaced out well and we had enough time to enjoy each without feeling rushed or like there was a lag. We loved our experience and will return again next time we're in Vegas.",

We ordered charcuterie that did not taste fresh at all, and was served solely with thin Sardinian bread. There were no accompaniments. The sopressata was not fresh. We also ordered a cheese plate that came with all rock hard cheeses. They came next to some type of licorice tasting fruit in a spoon. Not a fan. No one described what cheeses were delivered to us, so we had to find someone and ask. We only ordered 2 other dishes because the beginning of the experience was so dismal. The hamachi was just okay, and the duck over polenta was pretty good. It did taste like short rib, so I'm unsure if we were actually enjoying duck or not. The dessert list was mediocre.

    "text": "To preface, I visit Vegas every year. Actually twice a year. Yep I love Vegas that much. Can't help :) Lately though I haven't been blown away by restaurants on The Strip lately. Boy, I surprised myself that I enjoyed the food so much at Lago. Honestly the food was so good that I could see it succeeding in Chicago where I live. In fact if Lago was in Chicago instead, I'd make it one of my regular go-to places.   The tuna crudo was absolutely fresh and amazing. There were only four pieces (thicker than your usual crudo for sure) but the quality truly made up for it and I'm for quality over quantity if the quality truly meets expectations). I didn't want it to end.   The beef carpaccio was thinly sliced and refreshing. Not gonna lie -- I would have liked it better if there was less things going on top of the carpaccio. I'm a purist so maybe it's personal preference. It would be great to put the main focus on the pureness and freshness of the beef itself. Still a wonderful dish nevertheless.   The veal was a cold dish and thinly sliced. It was my first time eating veal served this way. Very nice and not heavy!  After all the relatively light dishes, the clam spaghetti was carb heaven :) Really enjoyed it a lot.  Final important thing: Lago makes solid cocktails. I've been lately so disappointed with cocktails (mainly old fashioned and Negroni) served at places on The Strip. The old fashioned just doesn't taste as good (and I'm comparing it to Chicago, NY, London etc). Why why why. My husband ordered a negroni and I got a Boulevardier (negroni made with rye whiskey instead of gin) and both were SOLID. We later tried one of their signature cocktails made from whiskey (I forget the name) which was also solid.  It was our last night in Vegas so it made a wonderful cap to the our vacation. It definitely helped chase the coming-to-the-end-of-vacation blues away :))) I can't wait to be back.  Side note: Some reviews complained the food is overpriced. Need to be realistic. It's the Strip. It's at the Bellagio. It will be more expensive. Even a salad at the poolside is expensive. And heck even McDonalds in Vegas is expensive.",

The waiter gave us our menus and when I told him that there was nothing on the menu that i liked he insisted there was something and tried to coerce me into eating something I was not comfortable with.  My wife all the while was uncomfortable with me. So I forced myself to choose something. I chose a scallopini dish. It reminded me of a quip about a noveau restaurant, where the customer was asked \"how did you find your steak\" whereupon he replied \"I shifted a string bean and by golly there it was! There were three thin slices of meat and the price was high.  I would never come here again.",

Our waiter was excellent and suggested off the top that the best thing to do was just to allow them to bring the food and we went with it. The Sicilian Gin and Tonic is a great cocktail, with blood orange. Goes down so nice and not too sweet. The food was to die for. They start with a crudo plate with a bit of jamon and sashimi, then move through a succession of plates. The lamb Ragu To me stood out particularly, it reminded me of the best lasagna I've ever had in Rome Italy. Then the steak at the end was so perfectly cooked with a satisfying slight crispness on the exterior. The food is definitely 5 stars. The only reason I gave four stars is because it was so crowded and tight in there I felt shoe-horned into the table, and my dinner jacket kept falling off the back of my seat and getting trampled.  It's a busy time and primo location, so I get it, But just beware it is pretty cramped & loud here. I would happily come again",

Maybe we caught this restaurant on a bad day/time (it was indeed around 10 pm when we went for dinner) but the food looked and tasted very mediocre (seemed almost homemade and not in good way). I tried many dishes here, including the meatballs, caesar salad, a pasta dish and a honey bread type dish. Nothing tasted particularly fresh. This would've been okay had the bill not totaled  around $120$ because the quality, size (small tapas) and presentation of the food was not even worth half of that amount. I don't mind paying for food when it is high quality but I do have to say that this restaurant in terribly overpriced. However, given the direct view to the famous Bellagio fountain, I would perhaps recommend this place for a drink or two.. but thats it.",

I would highly recommend the fave, octopus with squid ink coos coos, the meatballs (which literally melt in your mouth) and the thin sliced tuna topped with the sweetest mandarin oranges. Finally the Amalfi dessert is a must. I've literally never had anything better than Lago. I am definitely visiting regularly here. ALSO, try and get Nader as your waiter! He is an amazing waiter and is so helpful, nice, and comforting! The food portions are small but 5 plates and 1 dessert should be enough to fill up 2 people. My total was not as high as I expected as well and Nader also said the dessert was on him for my girlfriends birthday which is why we went. 100% must if you are able to go. Don't miss out on the best Italian in Las Vegas and the best that I have ever tasted.",

    "text": "The wife and I were walking through the Bellagio on a Monday night.  We were getting hungry, but hadn't given any thought toward dinner plans.   We spied Lago as we were walking through the casino and made the decision to give it a go.  We didn't have reservations (not that we likely needed it on a Monday night around 9pm), but were able to be seated immediately.  Seats were also available at the bar and it offered full menu service, so we opted instead to sit at the bar.  We started off with cocktails while we looked over the menu.  I had the Rose and Rye ($16) made with Bulleit Rye, Carpano Antica, Aperol, lemon juice, rose petal syrup, and garnished with smoked maraschino cherries.  It was everything that I look for in a drink, boozy, bitter with a touch of sweetness.  Lago is a small plates restaurant specializing in Italian fare.  Being all too familiar with the small plates/tapas concept, we picked several items to share.  We had the Risotto alla Trippa E Funghi or tripe risotto with mushrooms ($17), Polpo E Fregola al Nero or grilled octopus over squid ink \"cous cous\" ($17), and Malloreddos ($14), a small Sardinian pasta that resembles gnocchetti with pork sausage and tomato sauce.  I can't say that I liked one dish over the others since they were all excellent, each in its own way.  I recommend them all!  Lago was a bit pricier than most tapas joints that we've been, but I felt that portion sizes were fair, the food was quite delicious, and I know that I left satisfied.",

Server: Antonio -A 3. Food: A 4. Drinks: C  Overall grade: F.   Will not return  While the food is good and wait staff is efficient and friendly. Initial encounter was so off putting, it really ruins the Sunday brunch experience.   We had reservation for first seating at 10:30 and arrived a few minuted early. Yet we were told thete is no table. We were herded to the bar.  After 5 minutes bar tender looked at us, proceeded to fill his ice bucket. After another 5 minutes elapsed, he asked if we wanted to get started with cocktails......not exactly we thoughg privately at 10:30 am on on empty stomach. He left us.  15 minutes into our wait, hostess came over called out my name. I and my husband stood up. She looked at me and said. \"No it's not you.\" Then proceeded to invite another party to their table. My husband saw my name on the tag hostess was holding. I walked up and told her, she's perhaps mistaken. She said \"No. Not you\". I went to the 2 hostesses at the door and asked why. They confirmed to the first hostess that indeed, we are the correct party. She turned, glared at us and walked us to our table Not one word like \" follow me\" or anything. We sat down. She left. That was it. No, good morning, how are you, apologies for the mix up. Nada.   Our server Antonio was superb. He remembered my food allergies from my reservation. Asked the chef to recook the steak & eggs.  Two points for management: 1. Either retrain hostess or get rid of her. Poor customer interaction skills turn away customers. The sunday Brunch is as much about the experience as it is about the food. Hitting 50% of the mark is failure on the fiercely competitive Strip. 2. If you need to boost the bar tabs, make the drinks exceptional. Do NOT force customers to the bar for a 1st seating brunch. If you are truly logistically challenged, at least train bar tenter to offer a glass of water while guests have to wait for you to sort out your scheduling logistics and not push alcohol first thing am.  Feels like a fundamental failure on logistics management, which is both shocking and a huge disappointment for an establishment of Bellagio caliber.",

    "text": "Well I was really looking forward to dining here. Always try to go to a new 'splurge' place each time I come to Vegas and I hadn't been to Lago yet. I'm glad I went so I can check it off my list. I won't be back. I have it 2 starts because it's a beautiful restaurant and has big picture windows that overlook the fountains. Good: they did honor our reservation and even took us a few minutes early. The appetizer we order of chicken liver on crustini (sp?) was delicious! Just ok: The food was ok. Not up to the standard of a named Chef, I thought. I ordered the risotto w Lobster, shrimp and scallops (also comes w clam, which I asked them to leave off and they did.) The risotto tasted like rice I thought and for $33, I wanted risotto, not rice. My friends meals were very small and did not come with any sides. Weren't even offered as a buying option. They do make them and they come with what they call 'The main entree' or 'The entrees' don't really recall. Which was fine but no choices I was interested in. No apparent option to order a veggie or potato to add to your meal. So after our $200ish meal, 3 ppl, 2 glasses of wine, my friend was going to have to find somewhere else to get some more food. My friends meals were good but not so good that we would come back for it again. Bad: our server, though very nice, barely came by the table. If I'm splurging on an expensive restaurant, which I don't mind doing while in Vegas, I want a server who knows their food is overpriced/expensive and appreciates that I'm there to spend my money at her place of business. We saw the water refill guy way more often. Also, I thought the wines were overpriced and my Cab was just ok. And ok  I get $20 for a glass but they offer a half bottle (2glasses) for $52. Um, really? If I wanted more then I'd have to buy a full bottle to make it worthwhile but I can't drink a full bottle of wine at one sitting and still eat my meal or walk out under my own steam. Just sayin! I won't be recommending Lago to anyone.",

The Bellagio should cut their losses, close it and try again with literally anything else. Late night greasy fried stuff would garner more appreciation than this poor excuse for a restaurant. They only exist because they can claim to be next to the Bellagio fountain, which in their space has tables for about 20 people. All the Vegas BS and no value.",

    "text": "Wow.....simply wow.  Another of our culinary adventures on our recent trip to Vegas.  This restaurant does not disappoint.  We absolutely love small plate set ups as we enjoy eating the most variety in the least amount of time and being able to share a meal.  On this trip we had al  cipolloto e speck, capasanta, the 7 & 7, & the fusillioro.  The cipolloto e speck is a buffalo ricotta mini pizza that was delightful.  The 7&7 consisted of potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles, the flavors were so good together.  The capasanta was so refreshing and delicate in taste.  Scallop, blood orange, and pistachio.....this flavor combination is sublime.  The fusillioro was a pasta dish with lamb ragu.  Tasty but my personal least favorite of the selection we ordered.  Which isn't against the establishment, more of a personal preference.  The other dishes were just so very unique compared to this one.  You can't go wrong with any of the items that you may order on your visit to Lago.  The drinks are fantastic also.  Mine came with a spherical ice cube with an edible flower encased in the ice.  It was a shame that it never melted enough for me to enjoy it.    Please do yourself a favor and visit Lago when you happen to be at the Bellagio in Vegas, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Attended Lago for Valentine's dinner.  We were incredibly excited for this, and made reservations three months in advance to ensure we were able to visit.  Could not have been more disappointed... Yes it was Valentine's day, yes it was busy. But we arrived two minutes prior to our 8 p.m. reservation, and were told there would be a 30-minute wait, and we should wait at the bar. What? Okay, I'm guessing by the other reviews this is just what they do to try to get one more drink on everyone's tab, but that is unacceptable in my books. Oh, and the cocktail I had was awful.  We were then seated in a corner, small table, with literally no view of the fountains. My wife received a rose upon seating, which was a nice touch.  Our waiter could have cared less about serving us, even after we ordered a $180 bottle of wine (having said that, the person keeping our wine glasses full, who was not our waiter, was very kind and attentive). We went easily 20-minutes without seeing him, and when it was time to pay the bill, he disappeared for 30 minutes (seriously, we timed him); upon which I went to the bar to ask if I could pay there. They said \"where's your server, he will serve you\" ...  The food was seriously nothing special at all - in fact, it was quite tasteless and very poorly presented. Again, maybe this is because it was a busy \"holiday\" night...  Lago is located in the Bellagio near the North Entrance - skip it.",

Boy it wasn't a disappointment, only downside was there was only seating available at high tops near the casino, and not with a view.   Which was very surprising since it seemed very slow.  I ordered a whiskey and ginger, the soda was flat, but was not a big deal at all.  Just ordered another one.    We ordered clams, filet, and a platter of different meats with bread.  Everything was cooked perfectly, very bold vibrant flavors.  The tapas style menu really allows you to try many different things.    I will be sure to come back, and make reservations with a view this time!",

After narrowing to three, we settled on Lago and could not have been more thrilled.   We were lucky enough to sit outside by the fountains which I credit to our reservation being made far in advance.   The 7 and 7 (gnocchi and lobster) were everything we dreamed, and clearly the most popular on the menu. Our next favorite was waiter recommended- red wine risotto + burrata. We never would have ordered it, and are so grateful we did. Spicy seafood pasta was another highlight, and I could have eaten an entire meal of the focaccia + ricotta + honey.   Lastly, the professional photographer available was icing on the cake. We were surprised and delighted to have our photos taken and love to display them already! Cannot wait to go back.",

We were the first to arrive after they re-opened after their afternoon break. We also had some luggage with us because we were headed straight to the airport. They were nice enough to store our luggage in the back. The view of the fountains was exceptional. The food was pretty good. We ordered the crab and quinoa salad, branzino, and the seafood pasta. We really liked the crab salad - never had anything like that before. It had lots of crab meat. The branzino was perfectly cooked. The seafood pasta was plentiful and good, although I've had better at other places. Service was efficient and attentive; and they got us out in time to catch our flight that evening. The prices aren't cheap for the quantity of food you get, but this was enough for us given all the indulging we'd done on previous meals during that same trip. If you want a close-up view of the fountains, come here - especially at 5pm!",

A friend of a friend sent me Lagos way because I was looking for something different in a dessert! These same said friends, instructed me that I would find \"that\" which I was lacking in a dessert here. Red ropes part and silence please. The dessert menu has accompanied spirits that can be paired up in delicious matches. Wow, I discovered them both here!  Sure sure they serve amazing and stellar food; but this visit and three since it have only been to sample dessert and the accompanying adult style libations.  Does dessert deserve its own review? Absolutely it does! Dessert should be served before the actual meal, I feel!   Besides when I sat down at the bar, my very first visit here; I was presented with the drink menu by the fantastic bartender. After deciding what to drink he offered me the dessert menu. Maybe I just appear to have all her dessert indulgent ducks in a row; or your bartenders are mind readers! Probably a little of both! Props to the bartender although! Knows how to please us ladies, even from the bar stool!  The dessert menu here is seriously high tech piece of machinery too! It's one of those computer screens and that has amazing graphics and images of what your actually going to get! Fascinating little gadget, it is an iPod, for the tech savvy that shows the guests dessert porn and the accompanying libations.   My first visit to Lago I had the Nocciola Cappuccino with Carajillo on the side. The dessert is a sweet hazelnut mousse with espresso in the cake and chocolate too. Some of my favorite flavors represented together in union of espresso and chocolate! This was such perfection!   The libations that they offer just for that dessert are sublime. But one visit numbers two and three I had Royal Crown and Tonic. The smooth purple decadence of royal goes with anything. After two of these the dessert was up there with achieving many many impossibilities!   This last visit the Bartender seemed to be schooling the young padawans! Props too them all they gave stellar performances!  The staff here get a A+ for service everyone is exceptional pleasant and friendly. From the hostess to bartenders.   The seating in this restaurant does matter! The views that are water side seats are so amazing that when the fountains dance you catch some of the moisture from it! Great front row seats is a must at least once to watch the show! At night the views are absolutely stunning !  The question of revisiting this store is absolutely a yes! I intend on the next to start sampling their dinner menu. The smells coming from the kitchen beacon me to visit again and again! I shall give in to this temptation!",

The staff were very attentive, taking orders as we wanted to add additional plates of tapas, picking up empty plates and dishes, and topping off waters.  The view was the main reason we ate here and the fountain music plays through the restaurant when each show starts so hearing some Bruno Mars was just a bonus.  I'm not sure if I would give the place 5 stars if we didn't have such a great view since the food was a bit overpriced. I would definitely recommend the bruschetta, ahi tuna, and the meatballs - you only get three but they are about the size of a baseball each!  Thank you guys for an unforgettable dining experience!",

You might as well order a bigger dinner plate which is $50-70. For example the 8oz filet comes with asparagus and potatoes is $55, the 4oz does not come with anything and is $30. We got a pizza as an appetizer which we split 4 ways comfortably. I had the sausage bites and a few bites of my friends lamb, filet and duck. All were good and I felt full but not stuffed. I'm giving it three stars because I thought it was a bit over rated, I would rather watch the Bellagio fountains from the Paris restaurant across the way. Also our waitress was a little bit sassy. The ambiance was nice as we got there right at 5 but once it filled up it was noise and felt crowded.",

They have an outside dining area as well.  Dinner: Prime rib steak is delicious and huge! Dessert: The hazelnut dish is heaven.  The tiramisu comes with small coffee flavored caviars for extra fun.  The limoncello is refreshing and comes with lemon sorbet.  The creme brulee covers the entire plate albeit thin, but very creamy!  The dessert menu is the same for both lunch and dinner and they bring it to you on an iPad.  Lunch: The linguine is divine.  Perfect pasta with seafood, lobster included.  Overall the portions for most of the dishes are small, but the waiter does a great job explaining it.  If you're at the Bellagio and want to enjoy great food with excellent view of the fountains, this is the place to go.  Fun fact: The men's restroom is strange.  It has two urinals side by side without any dividers.  I guess who cares after you've had excellent food!",

    "text": "My wife and I selected this restaurant to have dinner with some friends after our vow renewal ceremony outside the Bellagio by the fountains. We were seeking something nearby the fountains, as well as a place with vegetarian options for us and plenty of other options for our friends.  We had made the reservations a month in advance and no problems there. We arrived at our reserved time of 6:45pm on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. Our server was prompt and the wine expert visited our table on several occasions to advise us.  I was a little disappointed with the view of the fountains. They knew it was our anniversary and vow renewal ceremony and that we had reserved a month in advance. So I am not sure why we didn't get a prime spot for a view of the fountains, but it wasn't bad. We were seated just inside and had to look through the people seated on the patio. So it was close enough, I guess. It didn't ruin our meal or our experience.  My wife and her friend shared a bottle of red wine that was recommended and were quite pleased. We split 4 small plates between the two of us and I think the other couples did the same. I would say an average of 2 plates/person is a good ratio, but if you're seeking dessert afterward, you might be able to swing it with 3 plates/2 people. We wanted to try as much as possible. My wife had one dish with fish, but as a strict vegetarian (not vegan), I was restricted to bread & cheese and pasta plates. Everything I ate tasted pretty good though.  With all of the options in Vegas, I think I would recommend this, but it'd be difficult to say this is a great place in relation to the others when I've only eaten at one place down the entire strip! If you're looking for ambiance, a romantic dinner, nothing too loud or wild, good food at the price you'd expect anything along the Vegas strip, and a good wine selection, this might be your place!",

    "text": "Food: for starters, we got the raw salmone and the margherita pizza. The salmon is very buttery and fresh. Since it is a tapas type of place, the portion of it and all their other dishes are really small. The pizza wasn't anything really special-- just had a nice thin crust. As for the risotto di fruti di mare, it had a lot of seafood in it -- lobster, scallops, clams, shrimp. However, the amount of risotto was really underwhelming in comparison. It was good, but just wish there was a little more.   Service: we made a reservation and when we arrived they made us wait a little bit. It was understandable but the hostess and the manager weren't too friendly/apologetic about it. Their attitude seemed like they just want us out of their hair when there wasn't even a crowd around their booth or anything. Our server was a little nicer but I feel like she did the bare minimum for anything.   Atmosphere: the dining area really does have a nice view of the water fountain. Everyone gets excited when it turns on. It's just a little uncomfortable on how cramped it feels inside.   Great place for special occasions and holiday dinners though!",

It turns out people want a window seat at this place to see the fountains at Belliago. We started with the Salumi platter. 3 meats, good but nothing mind blowing. It was served with this thin large cracker which was very good. But this platter seemed like it was missing something. A jam, nuts something. Next we ordered gnocchi with lobster knuckles. It was just okay. It was tasty but the gnocchi was a bit heavy and together with the lobster knuckles which was the same size as the gnocchi was just OK. Overall it's presentation was better better than the flavors.  Next was the branzino fish dish. It was prepared well and had good flavors. We rounded out the meal with a black forest dessert. It was pretty amazing. It was interesting with yummy surprises with each spoonful. I don't want to ruin it for you. If you only go here for the dessert and a drink it would be worth the stop. For two with one drink each was $138. Pretty steep for what we had but I guess they are in a high rent location.",

Make reservations and ask to sit by the window! This restaurant is Italian, but they serve tapas style. So order a good number of dishes to share, because the plates can be on the smaller side.   What we ordered: Bruschetta al pomodoro: Typical bruschetta, but definitely bursting with fresh flavors from the tomatoes and oil. Can't go wrong with this dish! Calamaro Ripieno: Shrimp stuffed squid. If you like calamari, you'd like this Slow-Cooked Short Ribs: what you'd expect. Wasn't my favorite though! Potato Gnocchi: I enjoyed this one but it seemed so much smaller than what I saw on Yelp! I wish there was a bigger portion of it. Fussilioro: Lamb ragu pasta. FAVE DISH.   My boyfriend and I thought we wouldn't get full but we were satisfied by the end of our meal. It was my birthday so they let me choose a dessert to celebrate with and I chose the crepe brulee. MMMMMM! Out of all the dishes, this was a big portion for a creme brulee! Loved it.",

    "text": "A sure shot for Italian in Sin City.  Full transparency, Lago was not at all on my Vegas radar. Santa Ana Yelper Cindy H. suggested we meet for dinner before taking in a show at the Mirage and when the restaurant manager of Huntington Beach's hottest Gastropub recommends a place, you immediately agree.   Walking in our table of four was astonished by the commanding view of the Vegas Strip skyline, the white linen which is seemingly everywhere, and the beautiful people loaded into the dining room. The service was magnificent from start to finish and we wanted for nothing throughout our meal. Lago just gets everything right.   The kitchen is run by none other than Chef Julian Serrano and the menu focuses on a thoroughly modern concept of small plates, here executed with an impeccable Italian flare. Sharing plates are the best way to put Lago through its paces and what is more fun than a culinary party with brilliant company?  I could not find a fault with any of the Tapas we enjoyed. We started with the astounding imported Iberico Ham De Bellota \"Pata Negra\" which is perhaps the best Iberico I have ever consumed and needs no garnish although they plate fresh Tomato along the side, you know... because they can. Another table favorite was the Polpo Alla Diavola featuring ultra-fresh Octopus in one of the most robust presentations I have seen in Las Vegas, or anywhere for that matter. Rock solid preparations of Carpaccio, Bresaola, and even one pound worth of expertly charred to medium rare Bone-in Rib Eye?   Si, grazie.   All of this goes on as the fountains of the Bellagio dance before you as you sip fine wine (or the mixologist inspired cocktails) and share amusing anecdotes with one another makes a dinner at Lago a True privilege. 5 emphatic stars for this sleeper in the Vegas fooding scene.",

They have many small plates that are meant to be shared but I got the butternut squash soup with chili oil and did not share any of it!

Drinks didn't look quite the same and were missing garnishes in a couple different ones.  As for the food, tapas size, good for around 2-3 people per dish on average for a decent taste. The Burrata was excellent, The ricotta and honey crostini was also pretty solid. Decent salumi platter with some quality prosciutto. The canneloni and the veal agnolotti were pretty good picks. The red wine risotto had strong wine flavor and looked dark and rich- fairly unique flavor profile.  Overall the food here is pretty good, definitely a must repeat because of the variety.

All this is,  is a menu with Italian Food but I didn't see one Italian server and I am quite sure they don't have an Italian Chef.  They boast \"THE FIRST ITALIAN RESTAURANT FROM AWARD-WINNING CHEF JULIAN SERRANO\".. and \"the first\"  makes sense now.       The reason why I mention I didn't see an Italian server is because For example, I couldn't work at an Indian Cuisine restaurant since I have zero knowledge of it. 'Spaghetti' and Meatballs was 'Bucatini' and heavy all beef meatballs . Too easy. Not the pork, veal, beef classic and lighter blend.    The Buratta quality was thin and runny  and masked with roasted peppers and crackers.  It was terrible.  Real Buratta made from scratch inhouse like Patsys in NYC, is plated alone and True quality that you savor every bite.   Server was merely there to take your order and bring you your dinner, totally disinterested because he has no understanding and care of what an ITALIAN restaurant would be like.   No table side grated parm , no oil and bread.   It's Bellagio. so um????  Don't call this an Italian restaurant if it doesn't really present Italian fine dining.",

    "text": "Came for a myvegas free cocktail. Had to go to the MLife desk first and they were fast and friendly. No quibbling about the free $20 drink which was the best Margarita I've ever had. It was smoked peach, so delicious. The view, even during lunchtime on a hot summer day was beautiful. The fountains danced to \"America the Beautiful\" at the top of the hour. The myvegas deal required ordering at least the prix fixe lunch. We were considering other lunch entrees, like seafood pasta, but the prix fixe had the best options to try a variety of dishes. Everything was spectacular. We had the Caprese salad and minestrone soup to start. The Caprese had delicious ripe tomatoes and was perfectly seasoned. The soup was light and full of yummy vegetables like potato and squash. It was finished with a dollop of pesto that gave it a great flavor. For our entrees we had the lasagna verde and the branzino. The desserts were amazing and I'm so glad we got the prix fixe for this course, if nothing else. Such a cute rendition of black forest cake and a mocha toffee chocolate cake. The pastry chef is top notch. I will definitely come back here. We took a look at the dinner menu and will plan ahead with reservations for that next time we are in Vegas.",

For the gnocchi with blue cheese we added Italian sausage and it was amazing! The Italian sausage was the one that took the cake. So flavorful and delicious. The di mare I definitely recommend to replace the pasta with linguini. Linguini and seafood are the perfect pair and the seafood was so fresh. The lobster knuckle potato gnocchi was also stellar.   This place is definitely on the pricier side. But the food is flavorful and delicious and the ambiance is really modern and nice.   Would come back again!",

It was a three course brunch: first course, second course, and last but not least unlimited dessert! I ordered the steak and egg and the steak was so juicy and tender. I would have liked to have my eggs cooked a bit more but it was good nevertheless. I was also pleasantly surprised at the variety of dessert and freshness of the fruits!   I also got a seat right next to the window so the fountain view was amazing! The portions look small but when I got to the end of my meal I was sad I didn't have more room in my stomach for more dessert.",

I love seafood, so it was good bites of variety of seafood... BUT again...even a tad bit more salt would have made a world of difference! Good thing I ordered the grilled sausage on the side!

Once we sat at our table, we were greeted by our servant who took very great care of us. He recommended multiple dishes and they were all delicious. The pappardelle was cooked exquisitely, al dente, and the veggies that accompanied it were very fresh. The branzino was thinly cut and flavorful. We got the cheese platter to accompany the branzino and they went well together and separately. We got other items plus dessert, but honestly I don't remember the names of them but they were all very delicious. Though expensive, every penny was worth it.",

The veal piccata is so flavorful and tender... the sauce just delicious. We also had the seafood pasta... a winner. Caesar salad is just the right size for two.

    "text": "I really like the idea of Italian \"tapas\", the view is perfect, it's a very hip & happening place, yet we were less than overwhelmed by the whole experience.  Even though we had a reservation, requested window front, M-life Gold, special occasion dining on a Sunday night, we had to wait more than 20 minutes for our two top table, three tables off the windows, while watching a group of six (with no reservation) walk in to a corner window table and a group of three with no reservation walk in to a window table seating.  So, when you start off on that kind of note, it's hard to overcome first impressions when there are so many choices in Vegas.  Our server was great and attentive until we ordered, and then he disappeared.  Runners delivered our food, and there was a check-in after we'd finished our dishes.  Other wait staff refilled our water and we poured our own wine (not a big deal, but really?).  The Somm did a great job of putting us on a good Barbaresco.  The restaurant smelled delicious, we saw beautiful dishes going out all around us, and we just didn't order the right things.  The salumi platter was great, as was the cheese board, but no one explained what each of the items were when the runners dropped them off.   Some we knew or could make an educated guess.  But once we chose not to have the Iberico jamon or truffle add-on, apparently we were lost causes.  The quail saltimbocca was good, but the sage overpowered the delicateness of the quail and we could have been eating any non-descript white meat.  No one asked us if we wanted dessert.  The check just appeared.  The decor is great.  Love the Mediterranean blues and water theme.  It was very noisy, with the background music and lots of hard surfaces and high ceilings, so it was difficult to carry on a conversation.  I really wanted to like Lago, and it was fine.  Good.  Acceptable.  But the overall experience just left us a bit flat.  Which is a shame because we have eaten at both Julian Serrano at Aria & Picasso.  Maybe our expectations were too high.",

    "text": "What an excellent dinner at Lago! The restaurant itself is very modern looking and you cannot beat the view from behind the Bellagio fountains looking towards Paris-Las Vegas! My boyfriend and I picked Lago for our \"fancy\" dinner while out in Vegas and we were not disappointed. We ordered four of the entrees (really tapas) and every single one was gone within twenty minutes. The shrimp ravioli was by far my favorite of the four we had. We also ordered meatballs that were good, but nothing that you can't have somewhere else. The bread with the buffalo/Gorgonzola spread was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  I really liked how they provide you an iPad to browse and order your drinks from. The pictures are fantastic to look at and its more fun than just wondering what that fancy cocktail is going to look like. I've attached pictures of our two drinks; pineapple mojito and raspberry puree Bellini. Obviously this being Vegas, it was pretty pricey so we stayed away from the wine list and only had those two drinks the entire evening. Service here is absolutely spot on. Our waiter was awesome and I noticed the same around the entire restaurant. No wine or water glass was ever left empty and plates were cleared before you could even blink. With our two drinks and four tapas meals, our bill came to $100 even (without tip). The only complaint I have is that it got REALLY loud as the evening went on. We left about 9 so I'm not sure if that was just people get amped up for the night or because the space isn't huge. Either way, it did not ruin the night at all. I strongly recommend Lago for a wonderful meal and amazing view while in Vegas!",

We wanted to place orders for more small plates after first round but could not get our waiter to return. Also wanted second bottle of wine with our first Malbec and could not find waiter or Sommelier (who was very helpful). We would have doubled our bill (6 people) but when they finally came back after initial plates were delivered we had waited long enough and requested the bill. As for specifics. The tuna was good, as was the Salumi plate. Pastas are very rich but tasty as well. Mussels were nothing of note. Hamachi was bland even with their added spicy sauce. Poor service would keep us from returning. Nice ambience and some tables have great view of fountains.",

The wall of windows overlooking the fountains and the Strip were really a wonderful addition to the experience.  The service was also top notch.

I made the reservation there because the time fit into the show we were seeing.    When we arrived at the restaurant they said they couldn't seat us at a table with a view of the fountains for another 90 minutes, and the restaurant was really bright inside.  We said we would try somewhere else.  I went back to confirm something with the time, and magically, they were able to seat us at a table with a view.  That was REALLY irritating.  However, I must say the wait and bus staff were excellent.  There were plenty of people around and our server was particularly visible, helpful and available.  Because this is a tapas restaurant that is KEY.  Some of the highlights were:  Crostini with chicekn liver  Scallops with orange and pistachio meatballs Risotto with tripe and mushrooms (I never had tripe before, but this was a good dish)  The crostini with salami and gorgonzola was just ok, as were the baramundi,   Presentation was lacking on almost all of the dishes, but, they are still working out the kinks.  All in all, I would go back again and would recommend you give it a try.",

The salmon for instance was way overcooked and very dry and when we sent it back, we got a new one that was medium-rare in the center but again almost overcooked on the outside.  The wine by the glass list was just adequate but by no means impressive. The wines were not special even at $30/glass.  The views of the Bellagio fountains were certainly a plus and we got a table with a view even if not right by the windows.",

I couldn't wait to eat here as soon as I heard Bellagio was getting a restaurant  like this, and Italian, one of my favorite types of cuisine.  Service was awesome, especially for just opening this month. We got sat promptly with great views of the Bellagio Fountains. Best view on the Strip. Restaurant was lively and energetic. Love it.   The offerings at Lago were really unique and really good. Our waiter explained to us that we should be ordering 3-4 dishes per person which sounds like a lot, but turned out perfect. Prices ranged from $10 to $20 each plate which is pretty normal for a nice dinner on the Strip when you do the math. The margherita pizza and ricotta cheese pizza were awesome. The Fusillioro pasta served with lamb ragu and ricotta cheese was delicious.   We also ordered one \"main course\" (these are a bit larger than the small plates)...the veal shank, as recommended by our waiter and it was some of the most tender meat I've ever had.   I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive wine list and dessert didn't disappoint. Will be back again.",

    "text": "A reason to return to the Bellagio! Something new and exciting at the former Circo property by Julian Serrano. The renovation was well worth the wait and one of my top places that I was anticipating. We were greeted at the front by very friendly hostesses that informed us we were free to view the restaurant while we waited. Wannee was especially helpful and informed that our beautiful table on the patio was ready and what a beautiful night it was to be outside. The room is very modern European with a nod to retro.  The color scheme starts with warm orange and red tones near the front, then graduates to cooler blues in the back of the restaurant with white the backdrop. Straight ahead is the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the famous Bellagio fountains, to the right is the lovely patio. We were seated right at the edge just as the fountain show began, there was even fog on the water which made the view even more special. The weather was perfect and the Strip in the background was ever so pretty.  We chose a few small plates to try. Brian our server suggested the crudo sampler, there was tuna, scallops, and salmon.  We also had a Cesar salad, the risotto, short ribs, and their famous gnocchi and lobster dish that melted in your mouth! Oh I cannot forget to mention the quail saltimbocca!!! Try this twist on the classic saltimbocca, I like it much better than veal or chicken versions. They have a nice choice of cocktails and even the bartender made me Virgin cocktails that were refreshing and beautiful.  Dessert was also excellent, the menu being on same Ipad list as cocktails and wines. Very fun and interactive. Sharing is encouraged here and this is a spot pre-club kinda place. Where you can still eat good food and feel comfortable to dance the night away. Hyde is located next door and Lily and The Bank are very close.  Thank You Julian Serrano and the Bellagio for bringing me back to this end of the Strip. With Omnia across the street, I feel there is a new pulse of life into the Las Vegas dining and club scene!",

Smack dab in front of the Bellagio fountains this place already has the best ambience in Las Vegas. The staff was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. We picked 5 entrees. The fusilli with lamb ragu was great, my girlfriend isn't a big lamb fan and loved it. The duck with polenta, that could have caused a fight for the last of it, that's how god it was, great duck over creamy and cheesy polenta. The focaccia with ricotta and honey could have been a dessert, great and was essentially a cinnamon roll lol. We got the pesto but opted for the wider pappardelle noodles, great choice. The sausage pizza was amazing as well. They also brought us an amazing chocolate cake for celebrating our anniversary there. All in all great date night and perfect place to celebrate something special. Needless to say, don't go if you're cheap.",

She could have aknowledged us with eye contact but we remained patient as she was busy. Two hostesses walked up to the desk which we were now standing directly in front of and did not even look at us. They stood there chatting and looking at their seating plan. Finally after a few more minutes I said loudly to my husband \"Are we invisible? Maybe we just seat ourselves here!\". We laughed, but they STILL did not look up. Finally, a male employee joined behind them and one woman looked up and said hello to us. We said party of 4. She asked, \"Do you have a reservation?\"  I said no. She said sorry we needed one. I asked if I could call now and make one and she said no they were full as we looked at the empty area to our left. The male employee looked down and said, \"We can seat you in the lounge area now or put you down for 8:45 or 9 pm.\" It was 7:45. We chose to go elsewhere. It would have been one thing if maybe there were a black pants dress code like the night clubs and we were underdressed. I would have understood that. However, we were not even aknowledged. That is just awful customer service. We did not have the opportunity to review the chef's work or the restuarant as we were snubbed at the door. I'm not sure if they were just that poorly trained in service  (which I find unacceptable in a place like Belagio) or if they saw us and our 1 year old and thought if they ignored us long enough we would go away. We took our business to the Palms Restuarant instead at Caesars and enjoyed Surf and Turf and excellent service and hospitality to our daughter. I'd really like to give this restuarant another chance. I will make a reservation as instructed and see if we are aknowledged this time and edit my review if they redeem themselves.",

With that being said I always look for Customer Service FIRST. I 've been a regular visitor to Las Vegas for over 30 years! My recent location to stay is the Mandalay Bay. I am the type where I usually get all Accommodations comped! Room, Food, Beverage.  This was a trip we've been planning for years... Finally my Baby was turning 21! Her ultimate plan was to go to VEGAS!!  Having a ton of experiences with MANY restaurants there I searched for days trying to find the perfect fit for my daughters 21 Bday dinner! There was 6 of us and I wanted an Experience plus amazing Food and of course impeccable service! So of all the Restaurants we could choose from... We chose Lago!  It had the Water Show view, (experience), Great reviews on the Food (amazing Food) Great Service (Impeccable service) We only found those things out by reading these reviews and asking those who were familiar.  That turned out to be quite a bit difference from what we read...  The Food Was AMAZING!!! The Server (I believe her name was Monique was AMAZING) But we had to get past the WORST part first! Dealing with Albert Najem (the GM)  We made reservations on Open Table, made it VERY CLEAR it was a Special Occasion and Requested to sit by the window for the water show... I then called the hotel and asked to talk to someone inside the restaurant (not a call center) I made sure I was talking to someone in the restaurant. They claimed they were one of the hostess in the restaurant! I confirmed that we would be seated by the window and that was one of the main reasons were were coming... I also said that we will be arriving in in a limo with a time the limo would be waiting to take us back and they said our seating request and timing would be fine!!  So here we go..........When we arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservations we were greeted by Albert Najem (General Manager) he told us without hesitation that there was over an hr wait for the tables by the window... I said we had reservations specifically for that and told him I even followed up with a confirmation to the restaurant... He still said well I cant help that. his demeanor was very condescending and he really didnt care that I was so upset!  He then offered us 2 other tables (1 being in the middle of the room- only being able to see the water in the sky... and the other a small shoved in the corner table with our backs to the water) he couldn't have been more UN accommodating. Didn't care that I took so much to make this reservation... was REALLY POMPOUS! He offered no gestures of an apology except for the sending over 2  Lemonchellos (1 for me and 1 for my daughter) TOTALLY CLASSLESS! At least i could have been a round... We never ordered them... we all had ordered drinks and he could have easily come over to say im taking care of your drinks and dessert...  I then asked our server to have him come over... he did and I told him the least he could do was comp our drinks... you would have thought I asked him to take care of the entire restaurants dinners checks!  the experience was totally RUINED by Albert and I will pass this on where ever I can!!!",

The waiter was a little awkward I think it could be his first serving job. I've done my share of time on that side of the industry. I would have expected a more seasoned server at that caliber of a restaurant. Our app was delivered to the wrong table. He must have messed up the seat numbers too because all the food was handed to the wrong person. I don't like it when my food is raffled off when you are paying $$$ (if it's $ then I don't care). I've been there before and the meatballs are really good. I asked for a double espresso and when the runner brought out a single he asked if I wanted him to bring it back and fix it!Are you kidding me YES I want my caffeine please. I didn't send back my meal because I never do. So... to be fair I never gave them a chance to redeem themselves. My friend also got the salmon and said hers was fine.",

This makes the meal slightly pricey, (as does the wine list) however the quality did not disappoint. It does make it difficult to share amongst friends as you really do only get a mouthful of each dish so I would recommend just ordering a few dishes individually. Standouts were the beef fillet, beef short rib cannelloni, the bruschetta (simple yet effective) and the seafood risotto. If you are chasing authentic Italian with large serves then this is not your place, but the modern tapas take on Italian food was executed superbly with the highlight being incredibly fresh produce. This kicked our night off at the bellagio perfectly.",

    "text": "Please keep in mind while reading this that many of the 4 and 5 star reviews on Yelp are by people who were provided a free meal and gift card for the opening of this restaurant (marked Elite'15)...  Perhaps this restaurant isn't meant to be geared towards a medium sized group in their 30's. The room we wound up in was an odd L shape with our table wedged in the corner like a bad afterthought. In order for one person to get out the entire side of the table had to get up. Our server kept insisting the best idea was to order a bunch of items and that the table share them to get to try everything. That concept doesn't really work here since some items are just 1-2 pieces of food.  How do you share one scallop with the table?  The better idea is to stick with getting 2-3 plates per person.  I like the small plates concept and chose several other restaurants during my visit to Vegas that used it and seemed to execute it better.  The food was prepared well and the flavors were good - but that's just it - it was only \"good\".  Not great, not amazing... just good.  With the total bill the size it was, I expect more than \"good\".  It certainly wasn't innovative with the flavors and menu items. There are certainly better options on the strip for the same prices with better menus, experience, and flavor.  You probably have a local place serving modern Italian and doing it better than Lago is, so skip this while in Vegas.  The bar/lounge area was the nicest part of the restaurant, but with a large group, their iPad menu made drink ordering extremely slow since they only had one to give us for 6 people.  Staff was friendly and attentive and worked so well together it was hard to believe this place opened only a few weeks ago!",

The dessert display at the end was the cherry on top of a perfect, flavorful but not over filling meal. There were several items but I went straight to the chocolate fountain with marshmallows and strawberries. Oh. My. God. The manager Albert stopped by at the end and showed us the gorgeous patio, he was extremely friendly and inviting. Can't wait to try more!",

She remembered and described all of the staff and all of a sudden they found our name.  I thought we would get a seat outside  and didnt mind a small wait since we were late also.   Then the manager ridicules the hostesses on how to seat which I found quite rude.  Hoping to get a seat they say sorry guys  u have to wait 2 hours.  I felt bad for my wife who all day was excited to show me this place LAGO.  Now I am pissed mess my night  up.....really.  I get her to sit inside  at table near bar and not be sad since last vegas visit till we have baby.    To make things worse this waiteress is super fast like a machine says just so you know all is a la carte and super small portions.  So pay a lot for very little...then front  hostess says your gonna eat here now after trying  to patch up situation.  Terrible service, snobby, rushed and just plain unacceptable  treatment  no matter how nice to look on the outside.   We got up and left this place quick as possible.  Had perfect dinner next door at 5 Star Olives who always treat us well.  Fix your service.....no surprise  the last month several bad reviews.",

    "text": "This had to be my worst dinning experience in a long time. I was in town for a conference with my wife. Made reservations, requesting a fountain view. We were seated outside with a good view, expecting a great dinning experience. Our waiter was good, not to the standards that I would expect at a place that $200 for dinner can be done with ease. While enjoying a cocktail, the wait staff decided to rearrange the outdoor tables for a larger party. This is fine and understandable, but when you send 6 people out to do it with people dinning near by is uncalled for. It was difficult for my wife and I to enjoy the atmosphere with a manger and staff talking about table placement.   The food, oh my god the food. I've had better food at Olive Garden. Food was cold, little flavor, and definitely was not worth $12 and up a plate. The things that we ordered I think I've had better Italian from a Sarah Lee microwave box.   I did complain to staff after one of the large parties came in having no respect for the other 3 couples that were dinning outside. They comped half our meal, still having to pay $70. I paid then wrote this review. I guess if you have a baller budget and don't really care about quality, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a nice romantic dinner with good food, don't eat here.",

    "text": "Well. I left less than charmed with my meal at Lago.  My friend and I popped in quickly without dinner reservations at the tail end of the night. We were seated in the lounge chars in the bar area which I would recommend against sitting in if you are planning to eat a meal. The seats and table height are awkward so eating off of plates was slightly uncomfortable.   We ordered the following dishes:  -alla ricotta e miele: ricotta cheese with a layer of honey on a densely packed focaccia roll. For 8 bucks, you get a dense piece of focaccia bread with a ricotta spread and drizzled with honey. It's...good. The first bite was great, but overall, the bread was heavy and I didn't anticipate such a sweet dish to start my meal. A more savory dish would have probably been more satisfactory. I would recommend ordering more than one if your party includes more than 2 people.   -tonno crudo: ahi tuna slices garnished with orange segments. 4 slices for $19. The tuna was rather sinewy which I didn't expect. The chewiness was a distraction from the rest of the dish. No good.  -spaghetti chittara: tomatoes, clams, garlic oil all tossed over al dente spaghetti noodles ($16). The noodles were perfectly cooked and this was probably the most positive thing I can say about the dish. It was bland. I ordered the dish expecting the clams to infuse some sort of seafood flavor into the broth, but I got none of that. It felt like the clams and tomatoes were just garnishes over very well cooked spaghetti noodles.   -fusillioro: corkscrew pasta tossed with lamb ragu + spuma di ricotta ($15). This was the most flavorful dish of the night. It was robust and had nice touches in flavor, but was slightly unremarkable.   Lago is the epitome of Las Vegas: fine dining with a so-so menu, but nothing spectacular. If you're looking for a nice place to dinner at in Vegas, I would suggest that you put in that extra ounce of effort to scout out an amazing meal. Lago needs some time to develop.",

    "text": "HOLY COW!   A Spanish Chef opening an Italian tapas restaurant. That doesn't make sense, you say? Well you're wrong!   Lago by Julian Serrano has replaced the space previously occupied by Circo. Everything is meant to be shared, and they recommend 3-4 plates per person. I was lucky enough to attend the soft opening, and it definitely didn't disappoint.   First, the atmosphere. It's bright, hip and lively. There is an open kitchen so you can watch the magic happen. There is also window seating, facing the Fountains, and a small patio.   I can't say enough about the food. Everything was really delicious and well prepared. I am still in awe over the branzino and also the grilled octopus (squid? Don't recall) served with black squid ink, risotto style. The smoky grill flavor on both of these items was out of this world!   Another favorite was the scallops crudo with blood orange. And the filet with Gorgonzola jus. And don't miss the risotto rosa with burrata! Seriously, everything was phenomenal!   The wine, cocktails and beers were on an iPad. I didn't explore this list as much as I should (I didn't even look at the beer!). They don't have an extensive list of house cocktails, but what they do offer was good. The Cucumber Mist and Lago Cocktail were both hits.   Prices are to be expected for the Strip, but the portions are well sized for tapas and I think it's worth the cost.  They officially open on 4/11. If you get a chance, go in for dinner!",

    "text": "We had brunch here this past weekend and the restaurant is beautiful with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.  We opted for the preset 3 course special which had a great selection.  The food is tapas style so expect to get small plates that you can share.  Everything tasted great.    Our complaint was that after we ordered, our waitress recommended an appetiser special for us to try.  It was pretty much a sashimi platter and was beautifully prepared.  Once the check arrived we saw that the sashimi platter she suggested cost more than both of our meals combined.    Yes, I know it's my fault for not asking the price before ordering it, but the fact that she just assumed that it would be OK to throw on a $60 appetiser really says something about ethics of the server and the restaurant in general. How inconsiderate do you have to be to even suggest an appetiser of that price and not inform the guest?  I don't think will return for this reason alone.   Lesson learned.",

    "text": "It's super expensive, but that's to be expected. After all, it's a celebrity chef restaurant smack in the middle of the Bellagio, overlooking the fountains. You're going to pay a premium for the privilege of dining there.   It's a little pretentious. The girls handling hostess and seating duties all had the same color dress and same scowl on their faces, like they were doing us a favor by seating us. Our server was a little cold at first but warmed up to us somewhat once it became clear that we weren't afraid to spend a little-or should I say a lot of money. This is definitely a place where you want to dress up a little.   The food is Delicious with a capital \"D.\" Most dishes are small plates that come out as they are ready. Our server recommended three per person but our party of 3 got by on 6 plus 2 desserts. Everything we had was well-prepared and pleasing to the eye.   Despite the little bit of attitude at first, service was very good overall.  We were seated close to the window, which gave us full view of the fountain shows. They were almost an afterthought because we were enjoying the food so much. Lago definitely makes the list of places to revisit next time we are in Vegas.",

I realize I sound super picky but hey, it's the details and subtleties that matter!  I did really like the cocktail I had. I can't remember the exact liquor but it was rimmed with smoked salt and I would definitely recommend that.

In fact, thanks to arriving early, we got priority seating close to the window and had the best view of the fountain show! The show began promptly at 11 a.m. with the National Anthem and was followed by another song. My husband and I opted for the three-course brunch with bottomless drinks - what a treat! I ordered the antipasto salad & my husband the truffle ravioli which was to die for. Honestly, you can't go wrong with truffle anything. Next up I ordered the Italian sausage burger with a fried egg on top and my husband the eggplant parmigiana eggs benedict, which was a tasty twist to the traditional way to serve it. My burger was delicious, and came with a salad, and I actually enjoyed that the burger wasn't such a huge & unmanageable serving. Last but not least, the dessert bar! They have strawberries, brownies and other goodies on skewers that you can dip into a chocolate fountain, or if you prefer, pick from an array of small cakes and tarts instead (or get one of each like I did). Service was impeccable, and the drinks were delish and served immediately despite me switching from bloody Mary's, Bellinis and mimosas each time around. I look forward to my next visit to Vegas and dining once again at Lago!",

You could never tell it just opened this week. Service was amazing! It's shared plates-style dining so the dishes are small but plenty, which is awesome because you get to try so many flavors. Our server was welcoming and explained the dishes and cocktails in great detail.   Speaking of dishes and cocktails, OMG. Chef Serrano does an exceptional job adding exciting twists to Italian classics with five-star presentations. The \"7&7\" (lobster and gnocchi) is to die for, and the salmon and scallop crudo (served raw with lemon aioli and some blood orange awesomeness) are ridiculous! The cocktails paired well with the food and were presented unlike any way I've ever seen. My bellini even came with a gold-dusted raspberry.  Perhaps the best part of dinner was the atmosphere. Very lively and modern with great vibes. Floor-to-ceiling views of the Bellagio Fountains--just breathtaking! The only way to get closer is swimming in the lake...which you probably shouldn't do. :)",

Hostesses have a space dress and you half expect a hostess with green skin or a third boob to come flying out of the kitchen doors -love that you don't feel like you are next to the casino and the large windows to see the bellagio fountains - great menu variety and reasonable price points - my favorite dishes: (1) octopus with squid ink cous cous. It will dye your mouth but the best octopus I've ever had. Had a lobster claw consistency (2) gnocchi in lobster sauce. Very light and flavorful (3) panna cotta. Just really light and refreshing (4) salumi platter.  The bad: - the scallop crudo dish. This thing STUNK. And yes the flavor was not as fishy but the smell itself was so offensive that I could not forget about it the entire night -steak. It was not my choice to order it. This was not a restaurant that had great land options. This was over cooked and had a strong char taste.   All in all, I feel like the good was really good but it was just too hit or miss and inconsistent to give it more stars. I'll try again and choose dishes that I want next time.",

Out appetizer was mergherita flat bread. And two glasses of champagne. For flatbread Excellent taste and sauce. As our main entry my husband and I both order the risotto. Tiny plate ok no problem, but the taste! No taste at all! The sauce so plane. Our waiter so busy never came back to the table to ask if we were pleased with our food. Never ask if we were celebrating anything? By the time he came by we were done eating by the way we order some bread form the busser. He very attentive ordered it for us and brought it to the table. Which by the way is additional charge. We were never offered to get another drink. Not what I expected so sad",

The food is served as small plates, great for sharing - good options for many palates (my co-worker is a vegetarian and she found lots of things that worked for her) - location is lovely especially at night to watch the Bellagio fountains - OUTSTANDING items: (1) polenta; (2) pasta with a bolognase (it had lamb in the sauce and the pasta was tubular - like a rigatoni); (3) seafood risotto;, (4) their house limocello; (5) bread with soft cheese and honey   CONS - We had a reservation for 8 and arrived at 8:10 (our bad). They said they would have a table in 20 minutes but we actually didn't get seated until about 9. But on the plus side, they did bring some complimentary cheese and meat, which was a nice touch. - I thought the service was just okay - would have expected more from an upscale restaurant in this city. I had to ask for extra spoons and plates a couple of times - Besides the above mentioned items, the food was pretty good, not great. On the \"meh\" list: hamachi crudo, spaghetti with seafood (frutti de mare), asparagus  I'd definitely go again, especially with a group.",

In the mean time it started raining and they moved everyone outside in and stopped seating people. Now I get you can't control rain but you can at least let people waiting to be seated know that.  The host and hostesses instead just let us keep waiting at the bar.  The bartender was really nice and actually tried to find out for us what was going on.   At 9:00 (over an hour later) we finally left and had a great dinner at Giada's restaurant across the street.  Management, please spend sometime training the hosts & hostesses.  You can't write a review on how great the food is if the service makes you leave.",

    "text": "I had a friend visiting from out of state so I decided to take him out to the famous Juliano Serrano concept Lago. We had a reservation for 2 yesterday the 22nd at 10pm for a table overviewing Bellagio fountain. The good part is that we got there and immediately we have been seated. This was all the good part of our experience.   Now let's talk about the bad part of our experience . We have ordered a bottle of vine for the two , Caesar salads as entrees and Beef Tenderloin with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes for main. For almost $400 dinner you would expect a nicer service but let's not get into it since we are sure nobody cares as they would fill that table up with new visitors at any given moment of the day.  LETS TALK ABOUT THE FAMOUS FOOD OF LAGO: Caesar Salad- 4 bottom end pieces of romain heart with sprinkled cheese and few croutons being thrown into the plate. The romaine was soft and brown,no crunch to it or anything to wow us for a plate that cost almost as a main course .  We didn't eat the entrees and we kept sipping on the wine waiting for the main course.  12 to 15min after the entree was served the server arrives with the main . We looked at each other and thought the same thing. Why are they pushing the food so fast on us. But anyway we started eating our main and keep staying positive enjoying the night. We have ordered the steak medium well and the asparagus grilled. What's was served to us was a bloody rare steak with 1\" thick boiled skinned asparagus. Disgusting.  We sent the food back to get fixed . They brought back the same plate but with charbroil grill lines on the same food we sent back. The steak was black burned on the outside ,the asparagus was the same boiled product but now has nicely presented with the black grill lines on it. Still mushy and soft at bite.  We decided not to complain anymore since they were closing and obviously didn't care about fixing their mistakes. We eat what we could, finish our vine and move on with our night.  0 starts for the service  0 starts for the food 0 starts for ambiance  5 starts for interior design and over the fountain views  Never going back or recommend Juliano Serrano places. A big $400 disappointment",

But the Yelp reviewers left glorifying reviews which intrigued us to give it a try.  And boy oh boy... we were impressed.  Their plates are of smaller sizes, and patrons are encouraged to order multiple dishes to share.  It's the tapas bar concept.  There were so many options and thankfully we picked good ones.  The short ribs cannelloni, the veal piccata, and the shredded duck and cheesy/creamy polenta.  While the 3 dishes were so scrumptious, the winner was clearly the duck.  We liked it so much, we ordered the second plate.  In all honesty, I'd be full just having an order of this duck and polenta dish.  It's the one with the most generous portion and the best!  Service was on the slower pace and we weren't impressed with the service.  Our waiter could not recommend anything on the menu, and we could not understand him.",

The dress code online is casual, but most people are dressed business casual to formal for dinner. Most people want to be seated out on the terrace... but the True \"best seats in the house\" are the window seats. No you can not request your seat prior to it...however, don't be afraid to request it when you check in. We only had to wait an extra 20 minutes and it was well worth it. The best time to go is around 8-8:30pm (when its beginning to get dark so the Strip is lit up with lights, but its still light enough outside for the best photos.) The food was delicious. The plate that stood out the most was the artichokes stuffed with crab. It had a light pesto/olive oil sauce that made it so light we could of eaten 5 plates! For dessert, the creme brulee was to die for. No words can describe the way I felt eating it. Even though the dinner was amazing, our waiter was exceptional, and our mouths melted over the desserts, the True cherry on top was the breathtaking watershow that we had front row seats to every 15 minutes. It Truely brought a tear to my eye. The bill was approx. 40 dollars a person (shared appetizer, individual dinner, and individual dessert) this DID NOT include alcohol. Last but not least...the bathrooms...floor to ceiling white marble. Felt like I was in a spaceship. Enjoy!",

We felt compelled to write a review as the service was such a vast departure from our previous two visits.  The restaurant has an amazing location with many of the tables offering an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains.  We consider the food very good and although the servers recommend 3-4 plates per person the small plates are generous and 2-3 per person is more than enough for most people.  We particularly enjoyed the mushroom risotto, foca guancia, and Spiedno Salsicia.  The lobster in the 7&7 was overdone but the remainder of our dishes were excellent.  The demeanor and attitude of the service staff is best described as surly and inattentive that evening.  There was not a single server that had a smile on their face.  The entire crew looked very unhappy to be at work.  We waited 15 minutes for our drink order which is ok, the restaurant was very busy but our server was distracted and rushed.  The two young ladies working with him were no better and we had to practically stand to get their attention and when we did they appeared annoyed.  It seemed like Nadir had to spend 90 percent of his time entering orders into the computer instead of focusing on the customers.  When the wrong flatbread was brought out we brought this to his attention but he insisted that we ordered a different option.  We were a little taken aback at the attitude of the service we experienced.  For the 3 of us the bill came to $361.56.  For this kind of money, there are too many options in Vegas.  We have eaten at other Bellagio restaurants and always found them very good to outstanding in quality and service.",

He said I'll try to figure that one out. $16 later I get what looks like was heated in a square bowl and plopped on a plate. No seasoning, no sauce- nothing- just a dry cup of noodles that cost about .50.   The waiter was rude, arrogant and made us feel like we were a complete waste of his time.

The short rib pasta roll up thing was weird because the short rib meat was blended or something so it was unrecognizable.  It had a weird pungent taste to it which was odd, maybe it's from the sauce?  The spicy sausage crostini thing was definitely pungent tasting which was hard to like.  Octopus was very good, but the couscous added nothing.  The raw beef dish was pretty tasty.  Spring chicken was nice.  Fish was just ok.

Request was for seating close to fountain show due to the evening being our anniversary.  We even had the concierge check to be sure the request was in. There were many tables along the area close to the show so not sure why one could not be for us, considering that we were guests of the hotel for the week.  We were seated at the back of a huge room that was packed like a cafeteria with tables only inches apart. The noise level was so that we could hardly talk to each other....not a great setting for a special night.  We asked to be seated outside...no tables for us there....so we opted for a small table in a side room.  So, warning to folks who make requests...maybe if you are a Platinum member, but don't be too confident if not.  Service was good...almost too quick...only five minutes between orders....we were done and out within an hour including dessert.  Food was OK, but considering the prices, not exceptional.  Unless you are guaranteed a front row view of the fountain show, don't waste your money.  The next day we had just the opposite experience at Sinatra's in the Encore....so worth every penny....I should say every dollar.",

The food was simply delicious, my favorites were the  CRUDO DI TONNO (the tuna was so fresh) DUCK AND POLENTA (melts in your mouth goodness) and EGGPLANT PARMESAN BENEDIC. I made sure I saved some room for dessert.  The dessert bar was well stacked with different fruits and pastries..they even had a chocolate fountain :)  My belly was very satisfieds!!! The main reason why I gave 5 stars because the service was excellent and the bottomless mimosas!!!  The GM Albert Najem made our experience very special.  Our server Derick was very attentive and made us feel comfortable.  We were treated like VIP's.  The decor is beautiful...loving all the arts and color schemes.  And who can forget the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain while sipping on our mimosas, eating delicious food and great company! I  recommend LAGO as the top place to visit while your in Vegas.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate at Lago recently for the first, and most likely last time.   We were  previously frequent guests of Circo which was the restaurant that was in this same spot before the Bellagio closed it to open Lago.  I've also dined several times at Picasso and was looking forward to trying Lago out.  Unfortunately,  the restaurant fell way below expectations.  On the positive,  it's a beautiful space in a great location.  However,  the food was mediocre at best.   The branzino I ordered had a fishy quality and caused me to be ill a few hours after eating it.   The pizza, risotto, and pasta dishes were plain and underwhelming. The restaurant, while pretty, has a VERY chaotic feel to it.   People were constantly getting up,  moving around, and there are a lot of staff moving around a lot too because of the small plate forrmat, dishes are constantly coming and going.  It is also extremely loud.  As a result,  you don't really feel that you're getting any personalized service.   Overall,  the food and dining experience did not come close to the sophistication of the physical space.",

Had lamb chops which was pretty good.  However the staff are not very attentive and we had to request 2nd  round of drinks after waiting for our waitress for like 30 mins. In the mean time the food got cold and nor did we enjoy our visit to this place,  nor the drinks. For the amount of money spent here, I expected better service and at least a better sitting table. We were stuck in front of bar on a stool, when we had specifically asked for a table. Very unpleasant experience.",

I wish I could give 4.5 stars and not just 4, but the pricing is a little high for what you get, in my opinion, but I guess you can chalk that up to just being in Vegas.  Service has always been decent, but my one gripe on that is that the servers seem to always be pushing you to order more, rather than asking.  Guess I'm nit picking a bit, but it's the little things that differentiate in my opinion from a 5 star establishment.  Still would suggest people make the stop, as I have always been satisfied here!",

The mushroom risotto was the least impressive - I've had better at Disney World! I'd also say this wasn't the romantic venue we were hoping for.

My brunch review gives high marks for the view again, inside but we could still see the water show.  We had a reservation, but still waited nearly a half hour to be seated, guess they were trying to push bar purchases, but highly annoyed with a half hour wait having a reservation to only be seated inside. Food selections were very good off the menu.  Brunch service was poor. Our waiter forgot to bring the pastry basket, we had to ask, while other guests next to us that we're seated after us had another waiter, and ordered and had food, plus pastry basket long before we did.  We had to ask for several things as the meal comtinued as the waiter was either over extended in the service area or was just having a bad day.  I would recommend dinner for sure at Lago. For brunch, I would have some hesitations about going back as a local with all the other brunch options in Vegas based on Lago's poor service and having to wait so long with a reservation.",

    "text": "Lago was supposed to be our one \"nice\" dinner before heading out to party the night away during our girls weekend in Vegas.  The view of the fountains while you dine is unmatched. The food had some great flavors and came out quickly.... And that's about all I can say about what I liked.  The service was ok-ish. I didn't really think it was appropriate to have our server open up our paid bills at the end of the meal and check on his gratuities at the table as we sat there.   As I said the food had some great flavors. Jackie B and I ordered 4 dishes to share. The branzino was done very very well. The funghi was also very good. I was excited for the seafood risotto but was left very underwhelmed. Not enough seafood/lobster to be called a seafood/lobster risotto. It also lacked that creaminess you expect in a risotto. So definitely not even close to being worth the price tag. We then ordered a Cesar salad at the end of our meal because after sharing 3 dishes we were still hungry. Quite possibly one of the worst tasting and unappealing salads i've had. The dressing was awful, the portion size literally looked as if the chef took apart a head of lettuce and found the 5 smallest leaves he could find and put them on the plate, and whole anchovies staring at me made my stomach turn. We immediately sent it back. The rest of our group is also sorely disappointed not with the flavor of their meals but with size of their dishes especially since this was considered our \"splurge meal\".   Unfortunately Lago is not a place to come to with an appetite or a place to come to when you expect to get a decent sized portion for the price of each dish. Sadly I won't return. With so many other amazing restaurants in Vegas, this is one you can skip.",

Our reservation was for 7:15 -we were barely acknowledged at the hostess station and told to go have a drink in the bar/ someone would be by to get us in a few minutes. A few minutes? At 7:45 we still weren't seated and when I went back to the hostesses, all three of them stood at the podium staring at their table maps discussing amongst themselves what to do.  Again, no one gave me a definitive answer, and we were again told to go wait in he bar some more. At 8pm I went back again to the hostesses and said 'this is not right! What is the purpose of having a reservation if you have no plan to seat us? We have show tickets and will likely miss the first part because we haven't even been sated for dinner!'   I was ushered back to the bar by a manager who bought us a round of drinks (small consolation just to shut me up no doubt)  We were finally seated and had a 15 minute dinner so we could get to our show.   As far as dinner goes, tiny plates- order several if you don't want to leave hungry.  No bread served unless you specifically ask for it.  Didn't have a chance to get dessert or appetizers because we were in such a rush. With so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, we won't be back to Lago- they completely missed the mark and didn't really seem to care.",

Of all the superstar chefs of Las Vegas I know of no one more dedicated that is there in person night after night to let nothing less than perfection leave the kitchen.  BRAVO and again thank you for what you have given,  MFH",

I came here to eat, alone late in the evening and had a great table with a great view over the 'lake', the Paris Hotel and the water shows. The portions are smaller so you can order several different dishes. All were delicious!  The only downside (hence 4 stars vs. 5) was that the room is quite noisy when it is full which was a bit annoying and when I arrived I had to insist on not eating at the bar. The ladies at the entrance I guess did not understand why someone eating alone would want to eat at a table. The quality of both the table service and food made me forget about it!   My waiter proposed to move me to a table on the terrace for dessert and coffee to enjoy the water fountains and the view over the 'lake'.  A perfect way to end the evening.  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some nicer dishes while in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I almost forgot that I had a food voucher for Lago from the Yelp Gold Elite event. Luckily, I remembered to use it a few days before it expired. Without requesting it, they sat us on the patio with a great view of the fountains and Paris.   Wanting to start out light, the Insalata sarda ($14) was good option with its ripe heirloom tomatoes and subtle salinity from the ricotta. Following that were the citrus dominated flavors combined with tuna crudo in their Tonno ($19) dish.  Almost all of the dishes after that were a hit. The 7 and 7 ($19) was my favorite, with supple yet seared gnocchi along with little nuggets of lobster meat with a savory and herbaceous salsa di crostacei. The risotto al vino rosso ($17) was a dish I sampled at the Yelp event, but had to get it again because it was so good. Less successful was the chalky and grainy chicken liver in the Fegatini di pollo ($8).  For those with smaller appetites they've got a 4oz angus beef tenderloin ($20) topped with gorgonzola. It's pre-sliced, making it easy to share with others. Likewise, the branzino livornese ($16) arrived table side cut into shareable servings. The skin was crispy, the meat was flaky, there was acidity from the tomatoes, and salt from the olives giving it varying degrees of flavor and texture. For a side, we tried the funghi trifoliate ($11) containing a few different types of mushrooms coated in olive oil and parsley.  While I'm not crazy about the futuristic decor, the concept and execution of the dishes are something I do like. Add to that a small patio with a great view and you've got a restaurant that should draw in a diverse crowd of young and old looking for an affordable meal, which is almost unheard of in the Bellagio.",

I went here with a group of friends we made a reservation ahead of time and when we got there they said they cancelled our reservation because we were 10 mins late. Then we decided to just go somewhere else and all of a sudden they had a table ready for us so we just took the table instead of looking for a different restaurant. Their plates are way over priced for what you get it's an average of 16 dollars for a tapa. The first thing I ordered was butternut squash soup which is my favorite thing I was surprised they had it on the menu. The soup was so bland it didn't taste like much of anything I've had better butternut squash soup at chain restaurants to be honest. The next thing I ordered was a shrimp ravioli the shrimp on top of the ravioli were baby shrimp you would put on a salad they were also so over cooked they were chewy which is odd because my ravioli was actually slightly cold. My friend ordered a cheese board I was expecting it to be really nice but it was mediocre there were only three cheeses on the board there were no spreads or anything it was disappointing I've had way nicer cheeseboards that come with a lot more things on them for half the price of what she paid for the one at this restaurant. The service was quick I don't have anything I didn't like about that. It was nice how you could see the fountain going off while you eat your meal but if you just want to pay for atmosphere I recommend you just grab a drink here I don't recommend eating here it's really not worth it it is just a disappointment.",

    "text": "I came to Lago during my birthday weekend with 10 other guests. Right off the bat, the open and refreshing atmosphere really makes the experience what it is and the environment is wonderful for socializing and being happy! Lago is located in the Bellagio and sits in the center overlooking the large pond/water show outside and has a clear view of the strip. Similar to its Spanish sister restaurant Julian Serrano (which I ate at the night before), Lago serves small plates with a few options for larger individual portions.  Wether you are with a large or small group, small plates really is the way to go. Not only do you get to try a maximum amount of food, but the food comes out at all different times throughout the night and really facilitates a social eating experience.  Because of the pure amount of food we ordered I was not about to try everything but ill give a run down of what I did try...  Baked Ricotta with balsamic and rocket - probably the most disappointing dish of the night. The ricotta was so bland and the tiny amount of balsamic really didn't liven it up. I was hoping they would have some sort of burrata on their menu but they don't... ($9)  Bruschetta - pretty basic, nothing extraordinary but solid (btw they come two to a plate but we doubled up which is why my photo has 4) ($7)  Margherita and Zucchine pizzas - small individual sized pizzas that come with 4 slices a piece. Best part was the crust - great fluffy texture and prepared well ($14/$11)  Insalate Sarda- I guess their play on a caprese ... white/red/green tomatoes stacked with cucumbers and topped with (again, kinda bland) ricotta cheese. a refreshing dish, nothing with crazy flavor but good. ($14)  Gnocchi Alla Romana - I'd say my favorite dish of the night - soft pillowy gnocchi topped with a gorgonzola creme sauce. The menu is a little deterring because it says it is topped with blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. It's easy to tell good gnocchi from bad, and this stuff is good ($14)  Paccheri Al Telefono - essentially lasagna. not sure why their name has a telephone refrence but hey, pretty darn good and simple lasagna ($15)  Polletto - half roasted chicken on  a bed of roasted eggplant. one of their larger plates, prepared well and the chicken was juicy and flavorful ($28)  Costa Di Manzo - braised short ribs - fall apart tender in a great reduction sauce, I highly reccomend! ($19)  Cucumber Mist Cocktail - a good go to for a refreshing fruity vodka drink plus it comes with some fresh cucumber and blueberries so you can feel healthy ($17)  There were more dishes on the table I was much too full to try, but overall I had a great dining experience here. They even brought me out a birthday dessert! Service was fast and the servers explained each dish as they came out.  Vegas dining can be a little iffy and although Lago is definitely not a cheap food destination, I'd say it's well worth a visit on your next Vegas getaway.",

This joint sure is jumpin'.  We were first seated at a table near the window; it had a great view, but also was next to a table full of conventioneers whose decibel levels were off the charts.  We were moved to a slightly quieter one in a more contained room, but happily, it still had a great view of the fountains - it overlooked the patio, which was off-limits due to a private party.  Kudos to the phenomenal management team, who really took care of us and saw to it that we would have a first-class experience.  And it was uphill from there.  Our server, Jennifer, was terrific in every way:  friendly, efficient, and more than happy to offer her opinions of the various small plates. Chatting with her throughout our meal added a homey touch to the experience.  Likewise, her assistants - Ali, from Iran and Oscar, from Mexico City - also added to the warmth.  A bonus:  I got to practice my Spanish with Oscar and my rusty Italian with the manager, and I felt like we were on a trip.  Well, we were, and it was fueled by the bottle of Prosecco we shared.  Some of the dishes we ordered were repeats, because we loved them last time:  the chilled tomato soup; the expertly cooked white and green asparagus; the red wine risotto that every reviewer raves about; the delectable short ribs canneloni.  But it wouldn't be any fun without trying some new plates.  I positively inhaled the 7 and 7 - seven gnocchi, which were hands down the best I've ever tasted, served with seven lobster knuckles.  Who knew lobsters had knuckles??  I rate this dish 14 YUMS.  Two delicious lamb chops were followed by a new taste for my husband: veal tonnato - thinly sliced room-temp veal with a light tuna sauce, enhanced with capers and pignoli.  This is a dish I used to order years ago at an ahead-of-its-time restaurant in upstate New York but haven't had since.  I loved it here, and the toasted pignoli were something I hadn't sampled on this before; they definitely added another level to it.  We don't usually order dessert, but knew we had to here.  Who could resist the crisp mini cannoli, ultra-crisp and with a tasty filling thinner than what I'm used to.  Thinner isn't a negative here.  And it won't apply after this Dionysian feast, either, when I get on the scale tomorrow!  Equally irresistible, and even better, was the Giandujotto, a hazelnut mousse atop a chocolate cake round that was moist and dense, with a tiny scoop of hazelnut ice cream on top of another chocolate round.  So what's not to like?  The noise.  This is not a place to have an intimate tete-a-tete, but rather a high-energy, fun place with a definite Vegas vibe.  And great food and service.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Sitting down with friends both new and old at newly opened Lago by Julian Serrano one could not help but comment on the space - the lounge up front lively and full of tightly dressed servers, the long bar well stocked with a bevy of spirits and ubiquitous televisions, and the breathtaking views of the Bellagio fountains gleaming in bright white - all a staunch departure from previous occupant, Circo, and although opinions varied from \"CVS\" to \"trendy and fun\" the service could not have been better, members of our table very well known to the chef and his team leading to an \"anything goes\" sort of experience where much fun was had, and plenty of plates were passed.  Part of the growing 'small-plates' trend, clearly targeting the Hyde crowd with a bumping soundtrack and see-and-be-seen settings, it was just after 6:00pm that our party of six found seating at a large circular table far from the bustle up front, and served family style with the chef making most decisions the meal began with well concocted cocktails and continued swiftly into plates of cheese, charcuterie, fociaccia, and crudo from which only the latter was particularly special - the scallops particularly buttery atop blood oranges with crunchy pistachios dialing up the textural contrast in a way that practically redefined the oft overcooked mollusk.    Moving next to pastas, several bound to become signatures given the sharability and relative low price compared to meats, breads, and entrees, it was here that the Lago kitchen really flexed its muscles and as good as both the lobster knuckle gnocchi and flatter version soaked in cheesy fondue were it was the risotto that undoubtedly stole the show, the red wine tinged version stretchy and smooth with burrata while the spiced up iteration with mint was the most memorable plate of the evening, small bits of tripe soft and seamlessly blended with rice that was good enough that we immediately requested a second bowl.  Impressed by tender octopus with large cous-cous soaked in black ink while wishing that the crostini with spicy Calabrian pork as well as the pizza were perhaps twice the size considering the price, it was here that the menu unfortunately found a few weaknesses, for as good as the previous pastas had been neither the Malloreddos or the Canneloni were particularly memorable, the former's pasta dramatically undercooked while the sauce of each was no better than stuff from a jar or Chef Boyardee.  Moving to heavier proteins, though not particularly a fan of veal it should be noted that the Viteello Tonnato stood heads and shoulders above the piccata, particularly as a light option for those heading to the club next door, and although both the meatballs and shortribs were 'good,' neither were nearly on par with versions available both on and off strip, though both will surely please palates of the less adventurous sort.  Personally impressed by the quail, while others found the pork-wrapped bird to be far too greasy, it was with two large plates that savories would conclude and although the osso buco is a good rendition the dollar-per-ounce ratio was far tilted to the left compared to better versions at Portofino and Allegro while the $55 Garganelli's pasta and tomatoes were textbook, though the lobster was overcooked and flavorless - a damned shame considering the quality of the one served over the gnocchi noted above.  Taking coffee, a strong double espresso over ice that could have just as easily been replaced by the tiramisu cocktail I'd ordered to kick things off, along with desserts it was with an unfortunate whimper that Lago closed out the evening, for as 'cute' as each of the five plates was not a single bite save for the Limoncello spiked Amalfi was better than something found at Bellagio Buffet, let alone nearby Jean-Phillipe, the $10 each tab harkening memories of Bazaar by Jose Andres for least inspired and overpriced pastries available in a city where no lack of exquisite desserts exist.  Expectedly precious and pricey, though no bill was presented to our table, Lago has a long way to go before becoming a 'go to' for people serious about their food and although I'm sure early reviews will be gushing given the nature of Las Vegas food media (and the fact that Serrano smartly launched the place with a Yelp event giving food, and $125 gift cards away to 'gold' elites) the truth is that better Italian food can be found in almost any US City at half the cost, or in nearly any local casino without all the bright lights and Avicii overhead.",

We wanted a table on the patio and was told it would be a 20min wait, which my party didn't mind since it was a Saturday night. The 20min was up and we were seated at the center of the Patio which had an amazing view especially since the fountain show was running every 15min. The ambiance was modern and elegant with one of the best views of the city.  Our Waiter Arturo was very friendly and knowledgeable and explained to us the concept of the restaurant setting, which was Italian food served tapas style. Every dish we had was delicious but some of the stellar dishes we had was the 7x7 and Frute de Mare Risotto which were consistent and balance throughout. Zucchini Pizza was light, crispy and delicious.   Overall we had a great time! Service and Food was on point and the ambience created a lasting impression on us. Great place to bring a group or family with great views of the fountains of Bellagio and Vegas.",

It is a joy to eat at Lago, with stunning views of the fountains, and a clean, open, modern decor which emphasises shapes and spaces.  If only the food were exceptional instead of competent (for the most part).  The basic concept at Lago is small plates, but they are really not so small, and two of them will satisfy the average appetite, with maybe a bit of room for one of their truly yummy desserts.  In fact, a Lago small plate is what restaurants used to call \"a meal\" before the ridiculous size expansion of the last ten years.  If you are not hungry, two per person may be too much.  All of the nine dishes we ordered were good, and we cleaned eight of our plates.  Only the pasta was left unfinished, and this because it gets very starchy when it cools.  But there is not one of them I can recommend as being exceptional but for the Bronzino, where the accompanying relish superbly compliments the fish.  Like all Bellagio restaurants, Lago is expensive, but not ridiculously so (except for wine), so you can probably afford it if you don't have a really bad day at the tables.  Bon appetite.",

After dining at Lago, it's pretty clear this place isn't going to be a secret for long!   Admittedly, I'm horrible about actually knowing what I'm eating and at times am that \"Are you going to finish that?\" type of person, but a few home runs I certainly can't forget:   Scallop Crudo 7&7 - Lobster and Gnocchi. Trust me. You're welcome. Fusilli with Lamb Ragu Focaccia with cheese and honey.  Gnocchi with Blue Cheese - Not sure what they were actually called, you'll figure it out.   Personally not a huge dessert person, but tried a few of them and they all were great. Other people at the table were blown away by the Tirimisu, Panna Cotta, and some sort of Nutella/Hazlenut magic.   The real show stopper here is the atmosphere. Gorgeous dining room, brilliant patio, and no matter how hard you try you can't miss those perfect Fountain Views.",

    "text": "OK, so to premise this off I'm not the greatest fan of tapas, or 'little plates' because well...I'm a big dude!  I love big portions!  So if you're gonna come to Lago on an empty stomach you will be sorely disappointed.  Just keep in mind most of the plates there are consistent with 2-3 bites!  It is highly suggested you dine family-style here with a good marker of at least two plates per person.  Olympic eaters beware!  Yep, I'm a Yelp Elite, and yep, I did come back with our gracious gift certificate that we obtained at a recent event held at Lago.  But, I would have probably visited without the comp anyway.  So call my review biased if you like, but I'm going strictly off of the food we ordered, and the service we received.  Because it was a Mother's Day weekend, and it was coincidentally also near my kid's 13th birthday (boy they grow up fast) I decided to make a reservation for a Sunday late afternoon dinner.  To my delight there was an opening for three, any later in the day and we probably would have been turned away.  Upon arriving at Lago, our hostess told me that the manager booked us for patio seating, right in front of the fountains of the Bellagio.  Beautiful!  We even had the 'Reserved' placard on our table - fancy, fancy.  Great start.  Our server was Christina, and wow was she super hospitable.  Of course she probably already knew we were coming, but I watched her interact with the surrounding tables and she was just as friendly and outgoing with them as she was with us.  For our entire dinner she was attentive and very patient with us, explaining every dish we asked her about.  Much thanks Christina!  After wishing the wifey Happy Mother's Day and the kid Happy Birthday, Christina helped us order some choice goodies:  *Margherita Pizzette - with tomato sauce, house mozzarella & basil *Al Cipollotto e Speck Pizzette - buffalo ricotta, cipolline onion & speck (cured ham) *7 & 7 - potato gnocchi, lobster knuckles, & salsa di crostacei *Ravioli al Gamberi - shrimp/mascarpone stuffed ravioli & fresh tomato *Filettino - 4 oz. Angus beef tenderloin & gorgonzola *Osso Buco - red-wine braised veal shank & polenta al formaggio  With Lago, they aren't kidding with the 'little plates'!  Even my kid was like, \"Is this all our food?\"  Spoken like a True champ.  But I told her to give it a try, sometimes food should taste very good but not make you overly full.  We all ended up liking everything!  Surprisingly, the ravioli ended up being the least favorite dish on our table (and my kid loves ravioli).  It tasted great but the stuffing on the inside was light.    The pizzettes were tasty but I of course wish they were a big larger.  Wifey & kid liked the Margherita, I favored the one with speck.  That buffalo ricotta was creamy!  Faves for the kid was the 7 & 7 and the Filettino.  She loves her rare beef!  It was funny because the three of us had to share a 4 oz. portion.  Cutting that beef into small slices was just too much.  Luckily wifey let us partake in the beef while she paid attention to the Osso Buco.  That was the star of the night!  So unctuous, tender, beefy, delicious!  This was a main course, but I wish it came in a bigger dish!  I would have gotten two orders of this.  The polenta that accompanied this was divine, with all the cheese & butter mixed in, it was silky smooth.  Decadent.  You probably surmised by now that we finished every last bite!  So much so we didn't have any room for dessert, and we probably should have saved some because Lago had some pretty looking ones.  Next time!  Overall we had a wonderful experience at Lago.  Food was excellent, and our service was excellent as well.  We enjoyed out time dining there, never at any moment did we feel rushed or unattended.  Yes, I wish many of their dishes were more main course sized but if you keep an open mind you will have a good time here.  We did, and I would not hesitate coming again for a nice meal.  Much thanks to Julian Serrano and his staff for giving us a night to remember.   Is it Spanish?  Is it Italian?  No silly...it's LAGO!",

Dishes ordered:  - Caesar salad: 2 leaves apiece for my sister and me  - Margherita pizza: 2 very small slices apiece  - Ravioli al Gamberi: 2 (or 4?) bite-size pasta shells apiece  - Dessert: 2 tiny bites apiece  The food was very bland in my opinion.  My taste buds enjoy themselves at Olive Garden more than they did here :p  You can get better everything anywhere else and for so much cheaper too.  The reason why you come here though is for the view: floor-to-ceiling windows for a great view of the fountain show right outside.    We unfortunately were not able to get a seat out on the patio.  The patio is first-come, first-served, and there was a big party that got there right before us and occupied most of the outdoor seating area until almost closing.  We were at least sat at a table right by the window.     Service was great.  The hostess was meh but all the guys who served us were excellent!  The stars I'm giving are for those guys, as well as for the view of the fountain show.  P.S. For cocktails I recommend the Cucumber Mist.  My sister ordered it and let me try it - it was light and refreshing.  I ordered the Rossa Bellini mainly for the golden caramel nest.  It packed a punch and was Instagram-worthy haha.  I preferred the Cucumber Mist, though.",

    "text": "The newest addition to the strip is Lago by Julian Serrano, located in the Bellagio.  Upon arrival you are greeted by your hostess' that are really friendly and talkative when escorting you to your table.  We made a last minute reservation on open table so we had a high top table near the kitchen.  Everything is white, bright and shiny.  Italian inspired furniture and decor, it is both modern and clean.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  If you are able to secure seats near the lakeside, you will be amazed.  The food is tapas style.  One order is perfect for sharing for two.  Our dining for the night included:  Zuppa Di Pomodoro - a tomato bisque with mozzarella   Nduja - a spicy sausage spread and gorgonzola on toasted bread  Salumi - platter of 3 different cured meats with thin crusted bread  Spaghetti Chitarra - olive oil based sales with tomatoes and clams   Risotto Al Vino Rossi - risotto made with red wine and burrata   Paccheri Al Telefono - tube pasta in tomato sauce topped with mozzarella   Alle Olive Verde - focaccia topped with roasted green olives and pecorino   Langostino - broiled in shell with lemon oil   Dessert  Lemon Curd Almalfi - with lemon Sorbetto   Classics Tiramisu - with coffee gelato  Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - topped with grapefruit and mango Sorbetto   Everything we had was very delicious.  I absolutely loved everything.  All the dishes were the perfect size for sharing.  They all were very flavorful, yet simple.  Our service was friendly and attentive.  Drinks were constantly refilled.  We were checked on by servers, busers and management.  Food came out fast and furious.  Our first set of orders came out in 10 minutes.     Don't expect a quiet leisurely dining experience here, as its lively and loud in this place.  The cost was very reasonable for strip and Bellagio dining.  Everything came out to about $175.  Cheap by celeb chef dining standards.  I can honestly say this is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Two of us came here for dinner last evening.  A front patio table had been reserved for us.    Our server was Carlos and we was absolutely top notch--the best!  The two of us shared all of then plates.  We started with the chicken liver and capers toasted bread.  Very good.  Next, we had the risotto with tripe and mushrooms.  This was better than the last time I had the dish when I was here for a Yelp event.  There was more spiciness to the dish.  Next we had the octopus with black squid ink cous cous.  Cooked perfectly and very tasty.  This was followed by our favorite of the night, the quail saltimbocca--boneless quail wrapped with prosciutto.  It was excellent.  Four nice sized pieces of quail with the prosciutto.  A perfect dish for sharing.  Then we had the branzino that was on top of capers, olive slices, and tomatoes.  The last tapas dish we shared was the 7 and 7, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles.  The gnocchi and the lobster were very good.  Not yet quite full, we ordered the osso buco served on a bed of creamy cheese polenta.  The osso buco was flavorful and had a fair amount of meat.  The cheese flavor of the polenta was absent.  Not quite done, we ordered two desserts--one that my dining companion had heard was very good and one Carlos recommended.  My companion wanted the giandujotto, hazelnut ice cream with another piece of hazelnut cream encased in a chocolate coating.  Carlos recommended the panna cotta with mango sorbet and sliced fruit.  Both were good but the panna cotta was the best.  It was light and exactly the kind of dessert to have after the meal we had eaten.  It was light, flavorful, and citrusy.  Service throughout our two and a half hours there was the best you could want.  Carlos was extremely knowledgable about the dishes and when asked, he was pleased to recommend things.  Our water glasses never got below being half empty--yes, I'm a half empty kind of person--and Carlos brought a fresh glass of iced tea to me before I was finished with the current one.  With the beautiful patio and the view of the fountains and Paris Las Vegas, it was a memorable evening.  I'm plotting when I can return and try some of the things I saw on the menu that will draw me back.",

The individual pizzas were good, but my chicken and mushroom was a bit dry -- maybe needs a little more cheese.  Or, I could have asked for some olive oil.  The wine -- nero d'avola -- was very good.  It's one of my favorites to have with pizza.  The second visit was two days later for lunch.  The dining area is bright and airy, with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.   I had the salmon salad -- absolutely delicious.  My husband had the caprese salad with shrimp.  A beautiful presentation -- with heirloom tomatoes -- and delicious.  And the portions were perfect -- unlike some other restaurants where I can't eat the entire portion and feel as if I'm wasting food.  We will definitely return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Extraordinary. I wouldn't say Lago is vintage Vegas, but this is the direction where food in this city is heading. Unlike the buffets and steakhouses, portions are shrinking, focusing instead on taste, texture, and presentation. The popular outdoor patio seating has a front row view of the Bellagio fountains. Dining is now no longer just a gustatory and olfactory experience, but a visual one as well.   While there are plenty of bread and meat options, the majority of the menu is seafood-heavy. The capasanta (scallop) was a light, clean, and refreshing dish to start off the meal. The pairing with blood orange was nice, and I loved the pistachios for textural contrast. One of the most popular dishes is the 7 x 7. Seven pieces of toasted gnocchi paired with seven pieces of lobster knuckles. Topped off with some tomato bisque, this dish was my favorite. For meats, the agnello scottadito (grilled lamb chops) was perfectly seared and didn't have that overwhelming gamey taste. The one dish I had an issue with was the pesce intero (baked boneless whole fish). This dish, meant to be shared for two, had quite a few sharp bones left. The sea bass itself was mediocre; however, I did enjoy the accompanying roasted vegetables.   The service was fantastic. The cocktails were on point as well - strong, but enjoyable. Patio seating is first-come, first-serve, but worth the wait in my opinion. Acknowledging the need for a more casual dining experience than full-service fine dining, Julian Serrano creates something wonderful for the modern crowd. Bravo!",

Our server, Rene R. actually seemed to be trying to give us poor service and was focused on turning the table quickly instead of creating a great experience.   He didn't ask for drink orders before the food order, some members of our party were never asked if they wanted a beverage at all. I ordered a glass of red wine after being rudely rushed through the process. Ten minutes later, I asked if I could receive the glass of wine I had ordered, and I was brought a glass of white wine instead. At this point, it had been about 20 minutes, so I just decided to drink it.   While ordering food, we shared who from the party would be sharing a tab. At the end of our meal (after never being asked about how our food was tasting or if we needed anything else), we received one check. When we requested it be split up as we had requested, we were told \"I guess, but it will take me 30 minutes\".   At that point, we reached out to the manager to share our experience. No apology, no trying to make it better. He just shared he would help calculate so it might get done quicker.   Totally ruined our experience, and we would definitely never return.",

    "text": "Second day opening review--- Julian Serrano--- keep in mind with openings, the menu always changes. Concept is small tapas style to share but more Italian instead of Spanish   Wow is what I can say about this restaurant. I will say it looks a little out of place in Bellagio (replaced Circo) because the decor is super modern contemporary inside and out. Their main pattern design is a overview of the streets of Milan and it has nice open space.  They offer indoor and outdoor seating(patio maybe 10 tables so limited) inside has floor to ceiling windows and they have private dining room and chefs table.   On to the food. FYI the following food has a formal Italian name to which I do not know them haha.   We had a little of everything. To drink try the cucumber mist cocktail. Very nice and refreshing.   The must try entrees fare the short rib, red wine risotto, lobster gnocchi, and ahi tuna crudo. All of which are pretty self explanatory but so delicious. I liked the sauces of their plate and said Mmmmmmmm to these selections.   I also had a cured meat flatbread, quail wrapped prosciutto, branzino, a spicy sausage bruschetta and a warm pastry with honey and cheese topping.   For dessert try the lemon bar for a fruity choice or the hazelnut chocolate dessert for the chocolate choice. (FYI- we ordered all desserts except the flourless cake as they ran out)   Since it is new we tried almost everything. I throughly enjoyed this place. Again keep in mind that what I had may not be available to you. My seat outside was in the most perfect location on the patio thanks to Albert and Brian our waiter did fantastic in asking appropriate questions to customize a menu for us. I look forward to doing this again.",

    "text": "Our dinner at Lago made our Las Vegas trip!! First off, I heard through online reviews that this place was the place to be to see the amazing fountains at Bellagio, and it certainly was. The view is perfect! We were celebrating our engagement and I wrote this on my reservation and requested a window table. When we arrived, I was promptly greeted and \"congratulated\" on our engagement, which was such an attentive gesture, as they actually read the \"notes!\" We were led to the best table in the house, along the window in the middle - the best view of the fountains! Because it was 4th of July weekend, the fountains seemed to go off every 10 minutes, more often than usual after 8pm. The food was amazing also. Everything was PERFECTLY seasoned and PERFECTLY cooked. I tend to enjoy food that could be over-seasoned as well, and Lago was just right, not too seasoned or salty, but highlighted the ingredients in the dish. Notable selections were (well, all dishes were great!!!) 7 & 7, the lobster gnocchi which had a sort of pumpkin/squash sauce that you lapped up with a spoon, the truffle risotto special - with tons of sliced truffles on top and a perfectly cooked risotto with lots of white wine (?) flavor - great consistency on the risotto (not watery at all, but not to thick) as most restaurants miss this mark!! We also had the stuffed calamari, which focused on the flavor of the calamari and shrimp stuffing, perfectly seasoned and cooked. We also ordered the braised duck over tasty cheese polenta, which was amazing. We don't particularly love polenta, but this was really tasty and had a good cheese and perfectly salted flavor. Finally, we were brought a surprise dessert, a small banana cream cheesecake to share and they had written \"Congratulations\" on the plate! It was such a surprise and I was so thankful for their attention to our special occasion! Thank you Lago!!! Can't wait to come back soon!",

We really enjoyed it. Some of the plates were hit and miss, but they have a great wine list and a lot of variety and the wait staff is pretty nice. Over all, a nice different place to eat. Maybe four stars, but the price, $380, was a little much for hit and miss on the plates. If they had only missed on one, they would have gotten four stars.",

I've been to vegas countless times and have walked past the bellagio fountains a million times without really giving it a second thought.  BUT inside this restaurant,  these fountains really come to life.  It's truly an experience because you are so close to them, you could feel the mist from the water.  Additionally,  it's synchronize to music, which I've never noticed before.  The entire ambiance on the patio is literally breath taking.  The food is spectacular.  Smaller tapas style, great twist on Spanish and Italian flavors.  My favorite were the octopus with squid ink cous cous and the lobster gnocchi.  Expect to spend at least $100/person if you're coming hungry.  However, totally worth it compared to the competitions along the strip. Drinks are a little on the pricey side, but packs a punch. Overall amazing dining experience!",

Very small portions does not begin to explain how small!!! Very expensive and not once did our waitress even attempt to come back to the table. They hurriedly brought our food and picked the plates up and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. Not because we wanted to be! They never even gave us a chance to order more. It was like they wanted to use our table or something.  Not a pleasant experience at all! We really didn't even get enough to say if the food was good or bad.",

After waiting about 45 minutes and a lot of confusion we popped into Lago, no reservation on Super Bowl Sunday. Grace, the director of food and beverage for Bellagio introduced herself to us after the hostess told her of the situation. Grace really went the extra mile to see that we were taken care of down to the last detail, as a result the Bellagio will remain top notch in my book! Vania and the staff at Lago provided amazing service and the food was to die for! We especially liked the tuna appetizer and the duck polenta though everything was really excellent! They even made us a special desert plate with Happy Anniversary drizzled in chocolate. The atmosphere at Lago is hip, light and airy with great views of the strip and fountains. Thank you Grace Vania and Lago, We can't wait to dine with you again! You can't miss with this restaurant, it's a must!",

As a foodie that travels all over the USA and beyond, I did have great expectations of this restaurant, despite reading some of the bad reviews, and taking into account the \"tourist trap\" location.  The food was underwhelming and bland.  Some of the items seemed to me to have been pre-prepared and stored in the refrigerator, because the tomato & mozzarella salad and the cheese plate we were served were chilled to the bone - a dead giveaway. The risotto was under cooked - risotto should have a sheen to it, and be cooked through - not served al dente \"crunchy\" as this one was.  Honestly, I can't even remember what else we had, it was that unmemorable.  We paid our bill quickly and headed to the roof top bar of the Mandarin Oriental for drinks and dessert.  Now that part of the night was incredible...",

The gnocchi with lobster knuckles was AMAZING as was the canneloni. The service was also impeccable.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing and took notice of the fact that I was OBSESSED with the Bellagio fountains - he offered to walk me to their outside tables and take my picture while the fountains were going. so sweet!  The only thing I would change was (1) we ordered a bottle of champagne that came out after almost all of our tapas were out (5 dishes).  That was a little late for the champagne for me... I think they could have brought out a few dishes and held off on the others while they waited for the champagne to chill. just IMO.  (2) the red wine risotto we had was heavy on the wine and low on the other flavors. since we ended with this dish, it left a sort of sour taste but we let it go since everything else was SO good.",

When I heard about Lago I had to check it out. I also come from an Italian family so Italian food is very important to me. This is an Italian style causing. It is located in the Bellagio. It's somewhat of a smaller restaurant but it does have a great view. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time especially if I'm busy evening. My fiance and I  were there to watch the hockey playoffs just recently. The service is great and the food is delicious. They are smaller portions almost still along the lines of tapas. A little bit on the pricey side but still affordable. The desserts looked delicious but I didn't get any (big regret). This was also not a drinking night for us I'm not sure about the cocktails. However it's a great date date restaurant and I highly recommend this restaurant specifically for the food.",

The lamb chop was so tough I have carpal tunnel syndrome and jaw pain after I finished the meal. The quality does not match up with the price.  The other restaurants in Bellagio offer much better service and food.",

The view of the fountains is a nice bonus, but the star of the show is the food. Everything was expertly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and just the right temperature.   The little 4 oz filet was divine. The duck, artichoke with crab, branzino, and the tuna crudo were also favorites.",

Drinks off the now standard iPad menu, all tasty and well prepared. 4 people ordered 9 plates to start. The lamb ravioli and 7 and 7 were the best so we got 2nd's on those. Bread not included with meal, order and pay separately. Very unusual for Italian. Did not do desserts but they looked good. I know this review is not strong on specifics, but this is really a visceral experience that you need to try, and experiment with.  Oh, and according to my wife it's too noisy. Personally the noise level adds a bit of theater and excitement for me.",

Apparently she was too busy talking to several other servers.  Absolutely ridiculous they need to really get it together.

No problem, I totally understand people not wanting to leave the patio. We got to enjoy some drinks from the menu. The drinks are very exotic and unique. The margarita for example uses volcanic salt from Hawaii . The mojito has passion fruit seeds and its delicious. My favorite was the LAGO cocktail. A vodka drink with a really cute flower inside an ice cube. The staff at the bar were friendly. They were very busy but always made sure my party and I had drinks.  The ambiance at this restaurant is contemporary. My favorite place to seat was obviously the patio. We got to enjoy the Bellagio Fountain Shows every 15 minutes and we were almost in front of the Eiffel Tower replica, which made the view more amazing.  The food concept was great, it was small tapas. I had the short ribs and Frutti di Mari risotto. The ribs were cold but Bryan, our server, was diligent and changed the ribs for warmer ones. He took them out of the bill which was nice. My seafood risotto was tasty and satisfying. In my table, my party got the lamb shanks with fingerling potatoes and they were amazing. Probably I'll get that next time.  I also had a bite of the fish and it was delicious I could not leave an Italian restaurant without trying their delicious tiramisu. It was small, different from others but really good. Overall wonderful experience, drinks a little pricey but exotic, the food was not ridiculously overpriced for Las Vegas.",

If you're looking for a place to eat that has the sights, ambience, and food, then reading this review is a start. :]  Out of all the times that I've dined here, I've never had any complaints. And it's funny to think that when my fam and I come here, we're seated at the same exact table every time, which is located in the patio. I would recommend getting a table in this area for first timers! Especially at night, since the water fountain show comes on about every 30 minutes at night. You'll have a perfect view! But don't worry about those nights that seem too cold. They have plenty of heat lamps all around the outside.  Customer service is always great here. Don't be afraid to ask questions on what the staff recommends. Sometimes they'll even offer suggestions that pertain to the number of guests in your group, like the customizations of portions.  All in all, it's an awesome place to dine at when looking for a nice eatery on The Strip. Pricing is not that bad, when considering this place to be more of a fine dining restaurant. Give it a try!",

The location was super nice, and it felt as if I was transported to France. Also, the porch had heaters, which kept us warm.   I ordered the octopus soup off of the lunch menu and it was pretty good! I liked the rich tomato based soup with chickpeas, and the octopus was super tender. The garlic bread crisps that came with the soup paired well, and the portion was just enough for a light lunch. My mom ordered the lobster spaghetti special and she liked it a lot, and my brother ordered a lamb ragu pasta. The pasta portions were honestly pretty big, despite the waitresses recommendation of each person ordering two items.   Overall, a good and quick option for lunch.

    "text": "We decided to eat at Lago before going to \"O\" (which is a great show).  It is a Julian Serrano restaurant. We made reservations well before coming here in order to get a table by the window to see the great Bellagio water shows.    The interior is light and beautiful.  The waiters are in these blue uniforms that are kind of odd (the black uniforms that the bus people wear look better).  Our waiter was from Italy.  He was excellent, both with some recommendations and in service.  They also have an extensive wine list.  The sommelier helped us pick out a great Italian red.  When ordering, you have the choice to get smaller plates or a big plates.  I decided on four of the smaller plates (which was perfect for someone with a good appetite) while my friend opted for the bigger plate.  We started with the Caprese salad.  It was incredible.  It came with three slices of perfect tomatoes (two red, one orange), great mozzarella (that complemented the tomatoes to a T), and then a dollop of caviar.  It was magic in my mouth, definitely worth getting.  He brought out two of the small plates to start, short rib cannelloni and the Carciofi E Granchio (which is artichoke and crab).  Both were excellent.  The short rib is puled so that you can cut through it with a fork.  The pasta surrounded it was fresh and so good.  Then the tomato sauce and cheese was heavenly--great dish.  I also loved the artichoke dish.  The mix of vegetables with the crab and parmesan cheese was just right--and it matched well with the short rib pasta.  The brought out the main dish with the final two small plates.  I was brought the risotto di fruti di mare (seafood risotto) and a four ounce filet, while my date ordered the filleto (the eight ounce filet). The one negative point about the meal was that both steaks were overcooked.  We both ordered them medium rare.  Mine was a little overcooked, while my friends was cooked at medium.  They ended up comping the big steak, so we were pleased with that.  Even though mine was slight overcooked, it was still good with a great sear and nice flavoring.  Out of many great plates, the risotto might have been my favorite.  The rice was cooked perfectly and the way it was flavored by the seafood made it just heavenly.  I easily could have eaten a large portion of this--really tasty.  Although full, our waiter brought over a tablet that had photos of dessert--and we were compelled to order  I had Giandujotto while my friend had the creme brulee.  My dessert came with two cookies, one covered with hazelnut mousse and the other with a vanilla cream.    Both were very good.  The creme brulee was good also--they put it in a wide, thin bowl so that you had more of the carmelized, crusty top.  This was just a fantastic meal overall--but if I were to go again I would stick to the Italian dishes exclusively.",

Caprese salad really lacked flavor, although the idea of the balsamic being presented in form of gelatin beads on top of the mozzarella was intriguing. The Fusillioro was FABULOUS - the corkscrew pasta was obviously fresh & made in-house, the lamb was delicious, as well as the sauce. Best item we ordered. We tried two cocktails from their crafted cocktail menu & both were unimpressive in their originality. $84 tab for the Caprese salad (three tomato slices & three pieces of mozzarella), the small bowl of pasta, and two drinks... blah.",

    "text": "When my friend saw a photo I took from my table she said \"what you're in Paris?!\" (Jokingly said of course!) I was there for a conference and my mother was my lovely dinner date for the night. I made reservations that requested a table on the patio with unobstructed views of the fountains (they have space heaters, so you won't be cold outside), but there are only two tables like that and we'd have to wait a while. Honestly, we came for the ambiance not the food knowing that we could get better Italian somewhere else. So, I guess the slight disappointment on my face showed because a gentleman at the front desk took the minute to study the screen and ask the server to put us at table #x. He said it's even better because we won't be cold and it's a direct middle view. We were not disappointed. I've posted a photo of it. Just wonderful.   The service in the dining room was somewhat lacking. Our waiter kept kicking my bag that was on the floor close to my chair multiple times without saying sorry or offering to move it. He also came back every two seconds to ask what we wanted even though we had just sat down.   Ah, the food. No bread basket. What?! At an Italian restaurant? We were told that everything on the menu was tapas style meaning for two people we should order at least 4 dishes. Okay. But, the Spaghetti di fruti di mare that consists of two small bites for my 105 lb mother is $38?  Okay. It was good. Not great. All in all, for $130 for two people, the experience was worth the first time and the food, while not the French laundry, was fine. You're in Vegas after all.",

Everything was packed but not only did we get in, we were seated on the outside patio with great views of the water. Our server, Brian, was so personable and knowledgeable about the food. Since this is a small plates, or tapas, restaurant, there were so many options on the menu. I asked him what he suggested and he immediately asked if we trusted him and if we have allergies. When we finished the conversation, he said he'd be back with food. He ordered the entire dinner for us. And we were glad for it!  We started with the caprese salad and a crab and artichoke appetizer (Carciofi e Granchio) . The salad was perfect with soft, fresh mozzarella and vine ripped tomatoes. Our dinner was an Osso Buco and a small morsel pasta (Malloreddos). The osso buco was well spiced, tender and served on a bed of heavenly polenta. The pasta was served with a sausage red sauce and melted in the mouth.   I would highly recommend going to Lago to see the fountains, or just for a bite to eat. You won't be disappointed.",

Its one sausage, Costco quality, cut into 6 pieces, on top of a red pepper cream sauce which was tasty for $25. Had they charged $10, I would have given 3 stars, but if you are going to charge 5 star prices, you need to have 5 star offerings. Also, the Gnocchi and lobster was ok. Lobster was overcooked.  Basically for $98 we got 1 cocktail, 1 piece of bread with ricotta cheese, one sausage, six gnocchi, and 2 ounces of lobster. After we left, we went out for pizza at Secret Pizza. $5 a slice, it was awesome!",

    "text": "You know how whenever people eat food on TV, they seem to overreact about how delicious the food is? They moan and groan and smile and close their eyes while savoring the food. I always thought it was just for TV, but Lago managed to evoke those emotions out of me. Wow.  I went with three friends during CES weekend right when it opened for the day. While they set up our table, we waited near the front of the restaurant in this lounge-ish area; that was pretty cool and hip. The restaurant decor was very clean and modern. Each table has a simple metal vase of fresh flowers; I thought it was a nice touch. Tables have a marble finish, so they're great for the instagram background LOL! They definitely put a lot of attention to detail in the presentation of the place; when we refreshed our plates, the server made sure all the logos on the plates faced you instead of randomly placing the plate onto our table. And since I went for lunch, there was plenty of light streaming through the windows facing the fountains.   For drinks, we got the \"mojito passione\" and \"rose and rye\". Presentation was SO ON POINT. The mint leaves of the mojito were even gold dusted! My friend and I did think that the drinks were pretty strong, The server did mention \"rose and rye\" was his favorite.  For food, we decided to go with the tasting menu. The food is tapas style, and they had a lot of options, so I'm glad we had the chef do all the menu picking for us. They ask if there are any allergies to be aware of. And then you just sit back and wait for the best food journey of your life.   They bring out two dishes at a time. NOTABLES WERE: the bistecca (as part of the surf and turf), lobster gnocchi, and the burrata dish. That sauce for the steak was SO BOMB. After my first bite of meat, I had the biggest grin on my face. And even as I'm writing this review, the memory of it is bringing a smile to my face. The lobster gnocchi sauce tasted very similar to lobster bisque, and we all loved it! The biggest letdown was the pasta dish with truffle; it was just okay. The other dishes were a blur, so good thing I took pictures of them! haha  Our subtotal came out to be 406 for 4 people. We ordered two drinks and a dessert in addition to the tasting menu. Our server was great, and they even refreshed our plates halfway through the meal.  TL;DR This is undoubtedly a pricey place.  But for the food, the ambiance, the view, the service--and let's be real, we're on the strip in Bellagio, it's worth it.",

Originally I attempted reservations at a different restaurant that was booked so at the recommendation of the reservationist I chose here as plan B and was not disappointed.   The decor is not Italian style, but rather extremely modern. Clean lines, lots of white crisp surfaces, and unique furniture abound. But what is really amazing is the outdoor dining option right on the balcony overlooking the Bellagio's water show. It was absolutely stunning! I'd be curious to know how many proposals a year happen here!  They don't sit back on the laurels of the view either. Dinner was delicious. I had the tenderloin and asparagus which was cooked exactly as requested. Everyone was pleased with their meal in our party. Topped it off with a perfectly prepared cappuccino and we were ready for our big evening.   Really the 5th star withheld just because of the price. If you have a drink or 2 def be prepared to pay a bill or so per person. Regardless, I'd def come back again.",

The dinner and the front row seats to the fountain show were both extremely memorable experiences.   Lago is one of Bellagio's eateries that overlook \"Lake Cuomo.\"  Inside, there are great lake views but I think that music is likely dampened because of the glass walls.  But outside on the heated patio, you can get the full fountain experience, which is what we were hoping for.  We were seated against the back all of the open-air patio so while we weren't along the railing, it was still a excellent view.  The only drawback was that it can be a bit chilly at night and the heaters are very necessary.  We asked for an extra one to be lit and they were very apologetic about not having the fuel for it so we put on our coats and suffered a bit.   Lago serves Italian food and we ordered in phases.  First, the bruschetta with grilled bread and garlicky diced tomatoes was fresh and tart.  The polpo was one of our favorites of the night.  The octopus was very tender and grilled well, and even my daughter couldn't get enough of the cheesy, savory squid ink couscous.    All their pastas are handmade and we liked everything - the shell shaped malfadores with a pork ragu, the bucatini with a garlicky clam broth, and a well prepared mushroom risotto.  I could have done without the sauteed wild mushrooms only because it was so similar in flavor profile to the risotto.  The pork meatballs were fine, but maybe a bit dense for my taste.  While we dined, we watched 3 fountain showings, which is more than we would have stuck around for if we were walking outside.  Service was very good and the only thing that would have made the night better was if they were able to light the heater we requested and if they offered to change out our plates as they did for other parties nearby.   Other than that, it's a great place to dine.",

    "text": "Let's begin simply put: the food here is very subpar, the wait staff was not very attentive, the atmosphere is lacking. Overall our experience was very disappointing.  We booked reservations and they had seating available the moment we got there with a fantastic view of the Bellagio water display and the Eiffel Tower. So far so good. We then wanted to order drinks, the wine list is extensive, but out of the 4 wines I would have liked to try only 1 was available by bottle only and not the glass. In actuality, they only had about 5-10 glass serving available  and half of them they were out of. That was disappointing so I just passed.   We then proceeded to order appetizers, we tried the bruschetta, bread was just stale and cold. I was looking for a more toasted style and the tomatoes were piled high and not really shareable. We also ordered the butternut squash soup, it had absolutely no flavor. I was begging for salt and pepper. There of course was none on the table.   Following up with our main entrees, I personally ordered the pumpkin seed crusted salmon. The portion size was adequate, but once again, the greens and fish had NO flavor. The most bland plate of food I've ever had. I was severely disappointed and everything felt lacking. I'm really surprised this place had such high reviews.   The atmosphere is another story, we wanted relaxed and somewhat quieter area, instead we got club music, tons of tables with loud chattering and little privacy, AND we couldn't even hear the music when the Bellagio water show was playing.   We wasted our money here and I would not recommend it at all. It's as if the chef forgot to taste their own food.   If you're wanting upscale and a nice evening dinner, go somewhere else. This is not the place.",

    "text": "Came here for Sunday brunch, our reservation was for 11 but we mistakenly thought it was 12 and showed up late but it wasn't a problem at all. The brunch comes with small pastries to start, two courses and then a dessert course which is a buffet.  I really loved munching on the pastries like croissants, donut holes, jam pastries with coffee. For the first course we got the Lobster Benedict and Raviolini. Both the dishes were DIVINE. The lobster was delicious and came with a spinach that was so tasty. The raviolini is basically a ravioli with egg yolk in truffle sauce which was amazing.  The second course we got eggplant parm and steak and eggs. The eggplant parm was flavorful and steak and eggs was simple. The second course was fine but I think the first course really outshines the second course.  For dessert there was a chocolate fountain with strawberries, marshmallows and then a buffet with flan, cheesecakes, cookies and many fruits (pineapple, kiwi, lychee).  There's also an all you can drink special for 28 dollars which we did not do but I got the OJ mimosa which good. Overall we had a really great experience here and I'll definitely be returning.",

    "text": "First off, I'd like to say that the food and our server were great, but it was hard to enjoy it because THERE WAS A DOG BARKING OUR ENTIRE MEAL. Seriously???????? At a restaurant this caliber, I'm paying $500+ to listen to a dog bark during my whole meal? Are you serious?  There was a 3 lb Yorkie sitting at the table right next to us, going from one person's lap to the next, that felt the need to bark non-stop intermittently every 10 minutes. (And the people with the dog kept giggling because they thought it was cute......) How is this acceptable? I asked the manager and other wait-staff what their dog policy is, and they said if it's a service / emotional support animal, there's nothing they can do.   1. Emotional support animals are not allowed at restaurants, period.   2. As for service dogs, by LAW they are supposed to \"stay quietly by your side at all times, unless performing a specific task for you. Service dogs must be leashed, harnessed, or tethered unless such a device interferes with the service animals' work, or your disability prevents using such a device\". This law is the same under the ADA, ACAA, FHA & NRS. There is NO WAY a yapping dog is acceptable at restaurants, period. I know people who need REAL service animals - those animals are very well-behaved and DO NOT act like that.   When I spoke to the manager, he said there was nothing he could do and offered to move us to a different table if the dog was being annoying.   ?????  I made reservations a week in advance and still waited extra in order for our family to be seated by the window for the view... We were seated way before this dog came into the restaurant and we have to move??????   ABSOLUTELY NOT. So what can the manager do? By law, the ADA says that \"If a service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, staff may request that the animal be removed from the premises\".   PLEASE do not just stare at me and say there's nothing you can do over, and over again.   I am definitely not hating on service animals. Like I said, I know people who need service animals and respect it 100, 1000%. However, if a \"service dog\" is going from one person's lap to the next and barking every 10 minutes, non-stop, I am not okay with that.   Management should know better than to just leave the situation like that! All the other tables around us were looking at this dog in disbelief because I'm sure they were thinking the same thing we were?!   If you want to run a high-class restaurant, MAINTAIN IT LIKE ONE.   Seriously, what a joke.",

The place is very pricey but it is damn well worth every penny. The portions are not small but just right.  We got the burrata, polenta for appetizers and I usually never get pastas but felt like I wanted the Gnocchi today and I got it. The gnocchi at most places gets too tough to eat after a while but these were delicious and super light.  I loved the creamy cheesy polenta as well. The burrata was soft, moist and delicious.

There seemed to be tables open but they still made us wait 15 minutes to be seated which was a tad annoying.  When we were able to sit, our table had , like most of the tables, partial views of the famous fountains. I enjoyed that the music of the show gets played on the restaurant's speakers, so you get a front row view from the comfort of your table.  I felt like the service was not great. Our server was a bit curt and  we had to ask for bread  (instead of being offered with a meal as you would expect at a Italian restaurant)  and had to pry our server to get information on the menu which we expected to be offered naturally. The vibe was just weird.  They do 'small dishes; tapa style to share, and we started with the Mussels, which were were ginormous, probably the  biggest mussels I've ever had,  and they were prepared with a spicy tomato sauce which was delectable. We also had the seafood risotto which was a little disappointing. The scallops and shrimp on the risotto were tiny and sparse. Overall the dish was okay but on the forgettable side.",

    "text": "One of the highlights of my Wife and I's anniversary trip to Vegas was eating at Lago's.  I was able to make reservations for this momentous occasion and they gave us the best table in the house right up front where the fountain view of the Bellagio was unobstructed.  Not only did we have the best table in the house but the both of us were greeted by the most humble Chef Tom who was the Sous Chef of Julian Serrano for the night.    We started off our meal with two appetizers, the caprese which consisted of herloom tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil along with carfiofi e granchio which consisted of king crab meat, artichoke, parmesan, and arugula dressing.  The two appetizers were filled with the freshest ingredients that really complimented each other in the most magical of ways.    Once we were finished with the appetizers they started bringing in the big guns with the main courses which started with the risotto di fruti di mare which came with lobster, scallop, shrimp, clams, and tomatoes which was amazingly delicious. The seafood was not overcooked and the risotto had the perfect consistency of not too soft and not too hard.  Overall this dish was really memorable and definitely one everyone should if they are a fan of seafood and or risotto.  The second entree we ordered was the costa di manzo or slow-cooked short ribs which came out thinly sliced with a total of 6 individual pieces with a generous layer of demi style glaze and a red pepper to liven up the taste buds.  The short rib itself was super fall apart tender but the flavor fell a little short of what I expected it to be.  Overall I felt that this dish was good but not great.  The last entree we closed out with was the bistecca or 1 lb bone in rib eye which was precut on our request to a perfect medium rare which was really the highlight of our entire meal.  The rib-eye had the perfect combination of fat and lean meet evenly distributed throughout the cut that made each bite full of delicious flavor.  We were so full by this time that we were forced to pack up the remaining half of the rib-eye which we took home and reheated the day after and it was still amazing.  At the end of our meal we were treated to a special anniversary dessert platter which consisted of mini truffle like dessert cakes which really put us in a deep state of food coma in the most satisfied of ways.    The service was above average with most attentive of staff's which never allowed my water to drop pass a quarter cup.  The waiters repeatedly checked in on us to make sure the food was up to standards and we were treated to at least four rounds of Bellagio's fountain shows which was free on the house.    I will definitely be back to try the rest of Lago's offerings and recommend my friends and family to this restaurant for the ultimate dining experience.",

There are less than 10 items for entrees and they range in price from $38 (Spaghetti and meatballs) to $72 (1lb bone in rib eye). It would've been ok if the food was good but the food was mediocre. I enjoy Julian Serrano very much, esp at Aria. What a disappointment.  The focaccia with Ricotta and honey for $15. It was the size of a pop tart with cheese on top. Bruschetta was mediocre. Lots of tomatoes on top. The shrimp stuffed squid for $22 reminded me of shrimp hargow dumplings. 1 order. It didn't taste as good either  The frutti di Mare risotto for $33, was an appetizer portion. The risotto was not cooked properly.  Ordered 2 of the steaks, they were decent. Pesto pasta on the side was good. Spaghetti and meatballs were mediocre.  Caesar salad was not good. The portions of lettuce were small and half of them was the hard center.  Service was subpar. They even took the orders of a table that arrived after us before taking our orders, table was right beside ours.   There was a fly in the water, the server did apologize but didn't do anything about it.   Nothing special for Mother's Day as well. Not even a greeting.   I wouldn't eat here again. All you're paying for is the view. You can get it from a few other restaurants at the Bellagio.",

Garlic Bread - way too expensive for 2 slices of toasted bread that didn't particularly have a garlic taste.  I would not order it again. Spaghetti and meatballs - this was excellent.  All 3 components (pasta, sauce, and meatballs) were great. Short ribs - very good.   Caprese - excellent (a little salty, but I'm guessing the chef sprinkled a few extra pieces of salt on ours). Caesar salad - looked great, but was average.  I would not order it again.  Gnocchi - the best part was the bisque.  I would not order it again.",

Got some drinks and ordered the following plates: Polpa de Granchio E Farro salad, Margherita pizza, Bucatini al Frutti di Mare pasta, Branzino Livornese and what I thought I had ordered, Polletto (jirodri chicken).  When I ordered the chicken, she asked how we would like it cooked, which seemed odd because normally they don't ask how chicken would be cooked. Confused, my husband and I looked at each other and she just asked, \"medium?\" So we said sure.  Our four tapas plates came out- all small but very good. We enjoyed the salad, pizza and pasta but not the branzino.  So our main entree comes out and it's lamb chops. We tell the guy that's not ours because we ordered the chicken.  He brings our waitress and she said you ordered this, you pointed at it and I confirmed it with you and that's why I asked you how you would like for it to be cooked. I said I wouldn't order lamb chops because I can't eat lamb.. Turns out the lamb chops were right under the chicken and she thought I had pointed at the lamb chops. Instead of taking it back and giving us the chicken, she just gave us the lamb that I did not touch. Good thing my husband can eat lamb.  In hindsight, we really should've sent it back because it was $60 plate that I didn't touch. But it also made me mad that the waitress pushed for us to just eat it.. She wasn't mean or rude about it but how can you tell me to eat something I can't eat?  Even still, I'm giving it three stars because you can't beat the view of the fountains and the other plates were delicious. You're paying mainly for the view and it's definitely not an inexpensive view.",

The service was very over the top - in a good way and the food was delectable.  There are SO many places to go in Vegas for good food but the experience here will be worth coming back when we're in town again.  I loved it.  All of it.

My Fiance and I had the Carbonara Mac & Cheese (delicious!), the florentine chicken (AMAZING!), the polenta and duck (BEST POLENTA ever!!!) and MY FAVORITE the eggplant parmesan egg benedict!   The food was top notch and really tasty. We ended brunch with an amazing dessert bar but by then we were too full. We also had two drinks that were beautiful but also really good. The restaurant decor is great too and I felt like I was having brunch at a high end Beverly Hills establishment. We could see the fountains and the strip from our table. Our waiter was really nice and I though that the ipad with the drink menu was clever.   This is by far the BEST brunch deal on the Strip! I will 100% be back!",

I had one of the best experiences in my life, my girlfriends and I went there to celebrate my birthday on Sunday's Brunch. Memorable beautiful fountain views, and fun and satisfying dishes.  Upon being seated at the lounge we started with glass of champagne and amazing pastry basket brought to our table.  The restaurant had customized the menu to read HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRISCILA !!! How thoughtful is that and the hospitality is mind blowing.  We each were able to select our own 1 & 2 course. We got the:  Shredded Salmon Salad, Duck & Polenta, Raviolone, the Filettino and EggPlant Parmesan Benedict. Everything were very delicious!  After finished eating we seated at patio to drink our mimosas and bellinis, and have dessert.  They wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the side of the dessert plate. I think they went beyond their job to make sure we have a great time.    The dessert bar was self serve and they had: tiramisu, Nutella Crepe, Panettone Pudding & Fruit Salad, and chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, Rice Krispies.    In addition, the service was amazing, the bartender and server Monique were great. Monique was the one that set everything up she was beyond with outstand service, she did incredible job very helpful, knows the menu, attentive to our needs and with a beautiful smile that kept us feel welcomed....The gourmet food decor was nothing short of excellent!   I can't wait to return at a later date for dinner!!!  THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LAGO, and SPECIAL THANK YOU TO GM Albert Najem and Monique.",

The Patio was full so we got a table by the window. My friend had a Polpo D'avola and a Linguine Frutti Di Mare and I had a Crudo Platter which is a salmon, scalopp and tuna  We let Monique pick the desert for us since she made so many good recommendations and she brought us a platter with Mattonella, Amalfi and Djoto, it was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this place for either dinner or lunch, for a special ocasion or for just a Sunday brunch with this perfect view!

The truffle mushroom Risotto was so delicious, we saved some of it for the end, and ordered other things in the meantime. The Riesling was fantastic, and the Margarita and other small plates were delicious.   We mentioned about anniversary once, in our Open Table booking, but they certainly took that into account and gave us a table by the gorgeous Bellagio fountain. Moreover, they added a special message on our dessert too.  One thing to note is that this is not a place for quiet conversations. It has a great, energetic ambiance though.  Would definitely recommend.",

We had already sat down and ordered drinks when we found this out so we didn't feel comfortable leaving.  We also didn't want to spend a lot so we ended up just getting a few plates and did not get full.   The restaurant did not have reservations available for quite a while so we ended up at the bar tables. The chairs were not very comfortable.   I ordered the veal piccata which was pretty tasty. My husband ordered shrimp pasta and did not find it quite as satisfying.   We had wanted to go to Olive but it was booked up for a private event. Next visit  we plan to skip Lago and make reservations for Olive",

I didn't realize the brunch prix fixe was only on the weekends, but they were nice enough to offer it to us. This is a much more casual dining experience compared to his other restaurants in Vegas. Ordered the pulpo, lasagna prix fixe. They were both good. Also noticed they had some pata negra, so I had to get some. Our server suggested an excellent wine pairing for the pata negra. Wish more places offered pata negra. They also have good cocktails here. My favorite was the smoky peach margarita.  Also if you get the patio you can see the water show as well, but it's pretty warm outside though.",

Cocktails were tasty and the staff was very friendly (one waitress forgot my drink, but we did have a large party so all is forgiven).  I wish I could remember what we had, but we were hosted to their largest tasting menu that consisted of some absurd number of plates. It felt like 15 plates, I really have no clue. Each one was very good however. The wait staff serving the food were very attentive and always made sure drinks were refilled and explained every plate. They were also cognizant of any dietary restrictions we had and made sure everyone was taken care of.  If you have a chance, take a seat on the patio. It is situation right behind the famous Bellagio fountains and gives you a different view of the fountain show. Quite majestic. Just hope it's not a windy day or else you'll get a nice rain shower :)",

We started with the bruschetta and Caprese. The tomatoes in the bruschetta were overripe and tasteless. There wasn't enough basil, olive oil or balsamic. I also prefer having some fresh garlic and there wasn't any. I realize garlic isn't a thing in real Italian, just a personal preference. The caprese didn't have enough basil, EVOO or aged balsamic and the tomatoes were again bland.   I had a main course (large plate) of lobster and squid ink pasta. The lobster was OK but for $65 I would have expected better taste. My wife got two small plates (pesto and veggie pasta with Arabbiatta sauce). The pesto was OK, but the Arabbiatta was boring and filled with the cheapest veggies available (sqaush and carrots). We also got asparagus. We thought we were going cheap and dinner was still over 200 after a modest tip. I do not recommend. More show than go.",

Also, quite pricey - to be expected given the quality of the chef, the food and the wine list. Negative reviews of this place tend to cluster on those two issues.  So - what did we do? We went for a LATE lunch - you know, that time of day where no one really is eating? Like 2:00 p.m. Rolled in, the place was mostly dead, asked to sit outside for a prime view of the fountains that begin at 3 p.m. Ordered a bottle of wine, leisurely enjoyed the wine, ordered some appetizers & salads. Then we shared a couple of the pizzas (the fig one was to DIE for) and each ordered an entree as well (I got the ravioli and my partner got something with lamb that was amazing!). We communicated to our server that we planned on a leisurely lunch and he was fantastic at being attentive but giving us space to enjoy each other's company and the view. Best of both worlds this way - an amazing meal (still pricey, even at lunch, but about half what you'd pay at dinner), an awesome view (by the timing getting to choose our seating - especially since we rolled out by the 5 pm dinner rush), and a high quality dining experience. Try it. You won't be disappointed!",

There are some main courses which are bigger size and can go up to 50$. We were offered with a special dish which was white truffle risotto. The server mentioned it is an appetizer size. He did not say anything about the price. Saying its a small dish I assumed it will be around the same price as the other tapases which is around 25$. When we got the bill I saw he charged me 70$! Apparently it had real truffle pieces. How am I suppose to know that or know that truffle is very expensive. When a dish exceeds the normal restaurant prices by 3 times more I except the server to mention it. This just feels like they try to tricked us. They knew if they tell us the price we will not  take that dish.",

They even asked if we wanted a patio seat, which I forgot to ask for one in our reservations, but was I so glad they still had some available because the view was beautiful! Now, my boyfriend and I aren't exactly \"foodies\" so we don't judge everything based on every little detail. Good food is good food to us, but we love tapas because it gives us the chance to try plenty of different dishes without spending tons of money. And let me tell you, each dish we had was loaded with flavor and all cooked so perfect, even their cocktails were yummy! We had a total of 7 tapas between us two, and that was just the right amount for the both of us. They even brought out a complimentary dessert for my boyfriend and if I wasn't stuffed, I would've had waaay more spoonfuls!",

Furthermore, I can't believe that Bellagio eliminated their Fountains Sunday Brunch and repplace it with Lago's 3-course Brunch.  Tried itthis morning (9/6/15).  It's not worth it.  I would definetly go to Mandarin Oriental or Wynn's Sunday Jazz Brunch from now on.  Eliminating Fountains Brunch will be one of the biggest mistake that Bellagio have made.",

Where the restaurant really loses it is the drinks are insanely priced for what feels like half glasses of wine.  On our last visit we ordered multiple $20 glasses of a chianti and it felt like there was about 3 oz of wine in the glass vs normally getting 5 to 6 ounces.  Our last dinner also suffered from the fact that we had no luck in getting some bread - not sure why this was such a challenge. Couldn't help but feel like the lack of bread and the tiny glasses of wine were designed to separate me from as much as my money as possible.  The acoustics in the restaurant are quite bad, so the noise level is a distraction when the restaurant gets full and the people working the host stand seem distracted with things other than their jobs as our \"5 to 10 minute wait\" ended up being over 30 minutes before we were escorted to a mostly empty room in which to dine.",

Arguing with your customers, telling them to \"google it\" (which we did and google agreed with us for the record) and that they are wrong and have no idea is simply rude and terrible customer service and ruined the whole meal.  It was a shame because the location of the restaurant is great and the view is stunning and as said above the service overall was very friendly and efficient.

We had a party of 14, and the only person they approached was our \"white\" friend. They were not attentive whatsoever, and we were seated smack in the middle! I was there to celebrate my 30th birthday with my family & friends, and I honestly regret bringing them to Lago. Never again! I've had better service at McDonald's! Oh, and I'm only giving 1 star because there's no negative stars.",

Their drinks - martinis were amazing- top notch mixology!  And they have an extensive selection of wines and beer.  The appetizers were a enough for 2/3 people to share and pure deliciousness.  The soups was a great and even in the hot weather we couldn't get enough of it.  The prime rib was made to our liking, juice and full of flavor and it was enough food to share and feel perfectly full after.  It was a special place, busy, but great friendly service.  The decor was stunning and it was very clean.  The kitchen was open to see the chefs hard at work.  And the best part was I was surprised with an engagement ring... It was planned and the waiter treated us with a free desert to celebrate our special moment.  He also brought the champaign right after my Mr. Popped the question.  Perfectly timing and the crowd around us watched with clapping, smiles, and heartfelt congratulations. It was an unforgettable experience.  When in Vegas you must try the Lago experience, you won't be let down!!",

They advised us that we should show up early in order to get a table with a view. We showed up half an hour early. We still had not been sat half an hour AFTER our reservation. I had to raise hell in order to get sat. We did not get a table anywhere close to the view. Everything took so long that we ended up missing our after-dinner plans. I was with good company, but regret making our celebratory dinner at Lago. They acted like we should be begging them to give them our money for an over-priced meal and a pretentious atmosphere. No thank you.",

Kudos to the sommeliers, they look young and could pass for your next door neighbor's kid, but knows what he's talking about - so listen to him. Great ambiance, spectacular views of the fountains. Again just be prepared that they serve small expensive plates (tapas), great selection of wines at reasonable prices for the strip, and sitting out in the patio - the best view on the strip.",

The view, the food, and the service were all top notch in my opinion! The outside patio isn't very big, so I am assuming there might be a bit of a wait in the evenings, but I can assure you it would absolutely be worth it for the view that you will get of the fountains while you eat! Monique was my server, and I could not have been any more impressed by how knowledgable she was of the menu. She was also super sweet and personable and provided top quality service. Even Gerti, the assistant manager, came over to see how everything was going. That was very classy in my opinion. And he was also extremely friendly and personable. It's safe to say I have a new favorite dining place here in Vegas, and am looking forward to taking my mom here when she comes to visit next week.",

Now the only thing that bothered me. Why go to this beautiful restaurant and spend your whole time looking at your phone. People look up your missing so much. We were sitting looking and talking to each other I started looking from my seat at the show. Than noticed a couple looking at there phone the who time. They weren't the Only people. It makes me sad how much people depend on there phones for entertainment.  All in all loved this place. Go but leave your phone on your purse or pockets.",

We have been to many many restaurants on the strip and this restaurant has HORRIBLE customer service, we were hardly acknowledge by our waitress maybe because we were dressed extra casual but her attitude was not welcoming at all, I decided not to eat because I just didn't want to spend a dime so I only ordered the short rib for my son.  He says it was great again we were never asked if we needed anything or how was the food I mean even to pay was a hassle, my husband got tired of waiting so he left and I literally had to walk by the register area to hand her $30  and left.  Food was great according to my son but it gets clouded by the bad service this restaurant offers.   Will not return to this place.

The food here is all tapa style so don't expect to get full just off of one dish. They recommend about 3-4 dishes per person, which was about right. We ordered about 1-2 dishes at a time so that we can gauge how full we were and how many more to order.  We ordered the following: 1. We started off with the caprese. It was a great start!  It's a simple dish, but they stepped it up a notch. Instead of drizzling the balsamic vinegar over it, it actually have these balsamic vinegar \"caviar\" so that it pops in your mouth when you bite into it.  It was so good that we got another one! 2. Tonno Crudo and Salmon Crudo - not bad, but not great either...probably wouldn't order again. If I'm eating raw fish, probably should have stuck with \"Yellowtail\" restaurant next door. But I'm such a fan of sushi and crudo that I had to try it.  3. Branzino - good tender fish 4. Capasanta (scallop) - tasted good, but felt that the scallops could have been a little bigger in size 5. 7&7 (potato gnocchi with lobster knuckle) - excellent !!!  the gnocchi had a nice crunch on the outside and very moist on the inside. The lobster add a nice elegance to the dish.  6. Caraofi & Granch (artichoike with crab) - excellent !!! This dish, along with the 7&7 above, round out our evening very well.  I would have ordered dessert because all the pictures I saw posted were just beautiful, but frankly we were so full from dinner.  All throughout the meal, we saw one fountain show after another. Great food! Great show!  It can't get any better than this.   Would definitely come back to Lago again. Yes, it is on the pricey side...but eating in Vegas is all about the culinary experience! So if you can afford to splurge, this is definitely the place to do it. The fact that you get a fountain show with your meal just makes you feel like you are getting a full dinner package. Thanks Lago for the lovely evening!",

My best advice is to order about 2 plates per person - one pasta and one meat/seafood. I've heard the wine is good too.  Gnocchi Alla - 4/5 - very creamy cheese taste that melts in your mouth. 6 of them were a bit rich for me. This tapas is best to be shared with another person.  Shrimp stuffed ravioli - 3/5 - mini shrimp were fresh but the marina sauce overwhelmed me a bit.  Clams in white wine sauce - 5/5 - my favorite dish of the night. A huge bowl of clams steeped in white wine and butter paired with thick spicy Texas toast  bread, with a kick. I could eat this dish all day long.  I also got a taste of the cannoli's, chicken liver and veal stuffed ravioli - all excellent. Overall, service is quite good and the fountains provide a great view.  Don't miss Lago when you are in vegas but expect to spend at least $40-$50 per person.",

The setting is very romantic and super modern also. The servers are all really great and great with customer service. The food was amazing and well worth every single penny! Do keep in mind that the portions are rather small, so I suggest you order several dishes and you won't be disappointed! Also another thing to keep in mind is to get a reservation at this place because it does fill up quickly, especially in the evenings on the weekends. We had the pleasure of our hotel staff booking our reservations for us and we are so glad that they did other wise we wouldn't have known about such a wonderful place. I will defiantly be coming back here again everything was unforgettable!",

After making reservations in advance for our anniversary we were placed in a very undesirable location with lots of noise and people brushing up against our table as they passed, while many more desirable seats were open. I asked our server to resolve the issue with the manager. I watched him go to the manager. The manager looked over at us, sneered and shook his head. The waiter came back nervously. I requested the manger speak to us himself. He came over irritated. He looked at his phone the whole time he addressed us, refusing to give a coherent answer at first. Then he claimed they were for others who made reservations before us, 3 months ago!  Yet during all this two gorgeous, very young women without reservations were seated there. At this point we had our cocktails which were very disappointing in taste and presentation, so we got up and left. I would never give money to a business that treats people so horribly.",

Not too much seafood) -salmon (comes in 3. Solid dish) -octopus (comes in 1 tentacle and black couscous. Yum!!)  -scallops (good decent) -7&7 (yummy lobster + creamy potato gnocchi.

We had reservations at 6:45pm and it was the perfect timing.  The sun was starting to set and we sat on the patio were we could watch the Bellagio Fountains Water Show.   We were able to meet the award winning Chef Julian Serrano.  He was super cool and very nice.  Glad we got a picture with him.    Our server was Fabio.  He too made our experience a memorable  one.  Oh and what are the chances, there was another Fabio in the mix and he looked like he was a manager for the patio dining area.  Both Fabio's were very funny and nice.  Thank you for taking our pictures throughout the night.  :)  TIP: The entrees are also small.  Food:    The food are small plates so we opt to share a few dishes and had our own entrees.   -Margherita Pizza -Burrata with bell peppers and garlic oil -Polpa Di Granchio E  Farro which had crabmeat, organic farro grain and confetti -Filettino 4oz of angus beef tenderloin  My friends had other risotto dishes but I had the beef tenderloin.  The food portions yes were small however the flavors were bold.  The char on the beef yet flavorful was delicious.    So excited to return.",

I know what styles I like but not winemakers, regions, and so one. When I realized how long the list was, I nearly fainted!  The sommelier quickly made his way over and man, what an awesome guy! He was able to relate what type I beer I like to drink to the wine list. He inquired about budget, which was nice, and found us a nice bottle from a region that he was particularly fond of.  I am sad to say, that bottle was gone in 30 minutes. It was that good! We liked it so much that the sommelier picked us out another follow up bottle after the first one disappeared.  I also enjoyed that the sommelier was able to recommend pairings for the wine as well. For the first bottle, he recommended a delicious sausage pasta. For the second bottle, he recommended some Spanish meats.  Besides the wine, the food was delicious. The good did make it to the table quickly, so I recommend spacing out your order..  I highly recommend Lago. It was one of my favorite meals in the States.",

The dishes came out quick and piping hot each time and they were always checking in on us. They were quick to do refills as well which I love. The only thing that was annoying is the fact that they will not seat you until the minute they open otherwise I would definitely come back. They were so good.

First off when I booked a week prior they asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them yes, my Mothers birthday to which they made a note. Not quite sure why as they didn't do anything at all. They were 20 minutes late, we arrived on time and once our table was ready no apology for such a delay. Now to the part that made me want to cry. I have a broken foot and it is hard for me to get around in my boot. I was walking to my table from the restroom and taking my time when someone came up behind me, knocked me and tried to push passed me. I turned around and to my surprise it was the assistant manager, Anish. Once he saw my boot he apologized but the damage was already done. It's embarrassing enough having people stare at you but this was just upsetting. He came over and apologize again and said, had he known I was in a boot he never would've pushed passed. To which I asked, so you would do that to any paying customer? I will say he took of a few things offour bill but it doesn't make a mark on how upset and embarrassed he made me feel.  Update.....just because we visited Prime the other night and it reminded of this horrendous dinner experience...anyone that read this then read their response, just FYI they never contacted me so the response from them was all for show on here I'm sure.",

Maybe we ordered food that had small quantities, and it was lunchtime. I was not quite full. But the taste was very delicious.  I had Agnolotti Pasta, which only came out four pieces.

Because this is a special event that people are flying in for, I want to make sure it is perfect. I'm so sad the Bellagio is not able to accommodate their customers requests, even for a special occasion. Was truly expecting better customer service from a hotel of this caliber. Disappointing.",

Any person that has wrote a negative review about here is crazy, especially about the price lets even forget the claims that the food isn't good because that's so not True. If you come to eat at a restaurant in Las Vegas, on the strip, have a fountain view, and is in one of the most famous hotels there you better believe that it's not gonna be that cheap but I'm telling you I've had steaks double the price at other places that don't even come close, there prices are actually very reasonable. I am from LA and have tried a lot of top-notch steakhouses and they never even come close every single time I decide to give another place a shot I'm always disappointed and start missing Lago. I love this restaurant the waiters are very professional. I can't even put into words how much I love the Ribeye, and everything else I've tried is amazing.

I was surprised to see the amount of vegetarian options they had so that was good! The portions as I already was aware of are REALLY SMALL. I was still hungry after my pappardelle pasta. The waitress did mention we should all order 2-3 plates per person lol. If we were to do that, it would of been really pricey! But it was a good experience and great way to enjoy the water show at Bellagio.",

We came in for brunch and were seated outside like we requested. But it was too hot to stay outside next to the beautiful fountain. So we chose to wait a bit at the bar for a table next to windows. Now I think about it we were much better off just eating at the bar! Our bartender was super friendly, attentive and fast when we were at the bar! And I liked the bar and lounge area much better than actual dining area too!   The brunch menu was extreme small with mostly meat and carbs. If you love pastries and desserts you will love this brunch. To me it was a gluten gas attack nightmare eating here. I chose smoked salmon and lobster Benedict for $8 supplement. Hubby chose duck polenta and steak & egg. Lobster was hard and chewy, poached egg was one of the worst. Hubby liked his food alright, but duck was extremely salty. The drinks were much better than the food here, specialty cocktail menu was creative and unique. The Bellini specialty cocktail I tried was so pretty and tasty, also $28 all you can drink brunch drinks were very well worth it. Good thing was that the food portions were decent for tapas. Also with unlimited desserts and brunch drinks you can get pretty full for less than $70 per person. And that's a good deal for brunch in Vegas.   Food was just not my type of food but there was no excuse for bad service cause this is an upscale restaurant. Our waitress was ridiculously slow the entire time, she also forgot about our pastry plate until I saw other dining people had those. Well I had hoped for a better brunch at one of my favorite chef's restaurant but it didn't work out. Don't think we will ever be back!",

If you go, I highly recommend requesting a seat near the water. No better seat in the house.   I was told the chef was an Italian from Spain. They serve dishes tapas style, so you are supposed to share dishes with the table.   We started off with the Sicilia Pizza and 7 by 7.  The pizza is a legit Italian pizza. Delicious crust cooked in a brick oven. I thought it could have been a bit spicier, but it was incredible. The 7 by 7 was 7 pieces of lobster knuckles and 7 potato gnocchi. The lobster and gnocchi were both cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. I'm drooling as I'm writing this.   Next round, we ordered the 4oz tenderloin and scallops. The tenderloin was cooked medium rare as requested, and served over a peppercorn steak sauce that didn't not overbear the high quality flavor of the meat. The scallops were also wonderful. They were cooked in a tomato base with onions. Superb!   To finish, we both ordered a limoncello and  creme brulee. Both were wonderful! Best creme brulee I've ever had.   10/10 would return. It is pricey though! Our dinner was around $250",

We got to the restaurant and maybe waited for about 10-15minutes before getting seated.   We finally got seated and the restaurant just opens up beautifully next to the bellagio fountains. The design of the restaurant is stunning. I like how you can experience the entire beauty of the restaurant as you go in. Wide windows, high ceilings, natural light coming through. It was just simply beautiful.  I love tapas and my parents haven't really experienced it before. So I figured this might be a good experience for them. We had 7 dishes split for the 3 of us. They are smaller portions and each dish is about $20. Please remember this place is meant to be small portions--hence tapas.   Each dish they had was simply amazing. You have to truly savor the flavors of the dish to appreciate it. Also, the plating of the food was wonderful. Except the pizzas, but I mean, there's not much you can do to make pizza look pretty haha.   The service was also outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive to us. He offered to take photos as the fountains were roaring behind us. We were there as the sun came down. He helped us choose a dessert for my dad's birthday. All in all, an exceptional restaurant. I'm glad I chose this place for my parents FIRST tapas dinner and on the strip. I'd love to come back and try other dishes!",

I'm sure everyone requests outdoor and window seats so I'm sure it's hard to accommodate everyone!  Our server was great. The food was okay, about 3-stars but we didn't really expect much honestly! The portions are tiny but it's still pretty good. I would recommend for a nice romantic dinner.",

For my first course I ordered the Antipasto Misto , which was alright. For my second course I went with the Italian Burger - hated it. The flavors did not work for me. There was some weird, sweet tomato paste concoction, which tasted really odd. For the third course they have a pastry buffet. I tried a few things and they mostly tasted like generic pastries you can get at Vons - I was not impressed.  I have to mention the hostesses were passing out flowers and chocolate to the Mom's as they were walking out. Such a sweet touch!  Ambiance - 5 stars  Service - 5 stars Food - 3 stars",

I even shared.  The cost per item based on the portion is a bit high.  On the other hand, I would definitely come back. The food was great and our server was awesome.",

It's soo pleasant out there and beautiful. The fountains weren't going during our visit because it looked like they were doing some work on them.   For my lunch I ordered the lasagna verde and a side of Italian fries. I really enjoyed both but the fries were truly perfection. They were crispy and had Parmesan on them. My daughter went with the margherita pizza and devoured almost all of it. The husband ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and loved it. For dessert we had the limoncello dessert and I can't remember what mine was called but it had chocolate and that was all that mattered. My daughter only wants gelato so she got three fancy little scoops and not a drop remained. Dessert was fantastic and a must!   Service of course was excellent. It was such a relaxing lunch with amazing food.",

It was a gorgeous day and the view of the Bellagio fountains and Eiffel Tower was fantastic from the outdoor balcony tables. The lunch menu is a great deal for this level of dining and even just for the outdoor view. The service was fine and we had a reservation. We got there before they opened to make sure we got an outside table in the shade. The ambiance was fantastic once you walk into the restaurant. This is what we ordered:  First course: - Minestrone soup - Seafood salad  Second course: - Branzino  Third course: Dessert  Everything tasted fantastic! We would definitely be back again for the lunch the next time we are back to Vegas!",

We had so much alcohol the past 2 days, we opted not to go for this option.   For brunch, it is $38 for a 3 course meal and a great view of the backside of the fountain. We started with a basket of freshly baked sweet pastries. Then chose 2 entrees and had a buffet of dessert. The entrees I was able to try, were:  1st Entree  Raviolone - yummy! Duck and Polenta - salty but good Lobster Benedict +$8 - didn't seem worth the extra $8  2nd Entree Eggplant Parmesan - my FAVORITE entree Apple Chicken Sausage Waffle Kurobuta Pork Ribs Lasagna - big hefty portion  All the entrees were superb and desserts were all so amazing with so many options. My favorite was the chocolate hazelnut like Canolli. Cherry on top with the amazing view of the bellagio fountains!!!",

Prices at brunch aren't all that outrageous here given that you're getting some pretty solid comfort food. Although the lobster benedict involves an extra surcharge, it was well worth it as it came with a nice portion of lobster tail. Similarly, the brunch burger was quite meaty and well-executed.   Brunch also includes a trip to the dessert buffet, so all in all, there's some pretty good value. Drinks, meanwhile, are a bit spendy, so go ahead, go all in for the bottomless mimosas.   As busy as this place is, service manages to be professional, on point, and highly efficient. A good choice for solid value.",

    "text": "I have had Lago bookmarked for a long time and was excited to try it, but it didn't blow me out of the water as expected. The food was only deserving of 3 stars but the rest of the experience bumped it up to 4. Let me begin.  Lago is located inside the Bellagio, but you probably already know that due to the gorgeous up-close and personal view of the fountains and their amazing water show. I believe the music inside the restaurant correlates with the music playing outside during each round of the show. They have an indoor seating area where most seats allow a great view of the fountain as well as a patio. We were fortunate enough to get the best table in the house, right against the pristine clean floor-to-ceiling glass windows. There are some seats towards the entrance that don't really afford you a view so I think it's worth it to hold out for a good one if you don't initially get it.    The Italian dinner menu is what drew me in but because of our schedule of events we only had time to book a table for their Sunday Brunch. Brunch is a 3-course menu plus a 6-item pastry basket for the table. You choose your first and second course (both small plates), and have free run of the unlimited dessert display with gorgeous dessert pastries, fruit, and a chocolate fountain. You get all of this for $38/pp which I feel is a fair price. You can add bottomless mimosas for $28 each which to me is not worth it, so we passed.  I started with the Bruschetta Cacio e Pepe. Scrambled eggs and peppered cheese are piled high on a croissant-style roll, but the roll felt a bit dried out perhaps due to being toasted. The eggs were light, fluffy, and delicious. The Steak and Egg for my second course was a disappointment. The steak just wasn't good. It was unseasoned and drenched in a sauce (not listed on the menu) which it relied on for all its flavor. I'm not a fan of steak sauce to begin with so the fact that there was no other flavor was displeasing. Additionally, my bf ordered his medium and I went with medium rare, and both came out the same temperature, somewhere closer to medium. The hash brown potatoes were delicious and onion-y. The Pollo and Avocado dish was a favorite at the table, and was packed with the 2 key ingredients.   The dessert display was my favorite part. The spread of mini desserts was gorgeous and everything I tried was fantastic. Props to the pastry chef. And who can resist a chocolate fountain?! I believe it was dark chocolate which I used to drench the most succulent strawberries.    Our waiter was very professional and nice, and I appreciated that he spoke to my bf's parents in Spanish which made the experience easier and much more comfortable for them. The view of the fountains made this a worthwhile experience. Perhaps next time I would come for dinner or stick with something Italian, such as the Lasagna or Pizzetta and Raviolone. They haven't quite sold me but I haven't quite written them off either.",

Excellent - The caprese salad was perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes were just the right amount of ripe - The cheese platter had a nice mix of cheeses that were at just the right temperature.  Smooth, nutty, and strong - My osso bucco was incredible.  So tender.  Large portion of bone marrow.  Mixed with a light red wine sauce and crushed polenta.  Oh my.  The best osso bucco I've ever had  The Service: - We were a group of seven and the cutoff for the automatic 20% tip is 8, so I think our server was a little upset thinking we were going to short her on the tip (I didn't, even though I should have) - She was relatively inattentive and had a few eye rolls.  Not sure why - The maitre d' made up up for some of her inattention  The Environment: - Spectacular views of the fountain - Way too loud.  Over the top loud.  No need to play dance music when the fountain show isn't happening.  The loud music made everyone speak louder, which made the overall volume of the restaurant borderline intolerable",

It had just the right balance of fresh and sweet. It also had a nice, fruity kick.   The culinary journey continued with the summer squash soup. It was hearty, yet refreshing.   Perhaps the top highlight of the night was the linguine pesto. The pesto was so rich, so green, so earthy (in a good way!), and so satisfying. The shaved almonds and grated parmesan added extra layers of flavor that completed the dish so perfectly.  And finally, I couldn't help but try the mortadella flourless chocolate cake. Whoa! Come through, shaved edible gold! And that was just the start of it, as there were so many layers for chocoholics to enjoy.  I must admit I wasn't blown away the first time I passed by Lago, as the exterior gives a bit of a \"cafeteria\" vibe. That all changed when I stepped inside. Not only are the fountain and Strip views amazing, but the food & drinks are out of this world as well.",

    "text": "********************* 1340 *********************    Lago is the latest project of Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano, he's been one of the original celebrity chefs to see the vision of Las Vegas; believe in it enough to move from San Francisco to Las Vegas to open Picasso at Bellagio; nearly 20 years later, just opened up LAGO in April 2015.      In 1998, Serrano brought his memorable Mediterranean-French cooking to Bellagio in Las Vegas as executive chef of Picasso. The Michelin two-star restaurant has been a 14-time recipient of the AAA Five Diamond Award from 2002 to 2014 and has received the coveted Grand Award from Wine Spectator magazine for its extensive wine list.      Chef Serrano then turned his unerring eye to the cuisine of his native Spain as executive chef of his eponymous restaurant, Julian Serrano, at ARIA Resort & Casino, which opened in 2009.  Featured on the restaurant's multiple a la carte menus is an ensemble of Serrano's signature creations including traditional and innovative renditions of tapas, paellas, seafood and more.  In 2010, Esquire magazine named Julian Serrano one of the Best New Restaurants of the year.  The restaurant also received the Best of Award of Excellence from Wine Spectator magazine in 2011.      In April 2015, Chef Serrano opened LAGO at Bellagio in 2015. Lago by Julian Serrano will be the chef's first Italian restaurant and explored a new take on social dining. The restaurant's small plate menu will celebrate Chef Serrano's creativity and signature flavors.  Lago serves contemporary, Milan-inspired Italian small plates. I got to try plenty of dishes the last 2 months here and all were on point.       Lago boasted spectacular views of the resort's iconic fountains on the Las Vegas Strip. If you can RSVP an outdoor table in the evening, you would enjoy it tremendously.      Service is excellent here as always. If you don't have time for dinner, Lago is a perfect spot for a cocktails before dinner or show. sit at the beautiful long bar and lounge, I enjoy bartenders Emer and Christopher, they are both fantastic.  The cocktails list is amazing, you MUST TRY at least 1!   - POLPA DI GRANCHIO E FARRO, fresh crabmeat, organic farro grain, confetti   - FEGATINI DI POLLO, chicken liver, capers, pepperoncino  - FUSILLIORO, corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo, lamb ragu, spuma di ricotta, love it.  - BRODETTO DI VONGOLE, clams, spicy white wine, love it.  - AGNELLO SCOTTADITO, grilled lamb chops, garlic, rosemary, perfection.  - POLPETTE DI CARNE, tomato braised beef meatballs, so good.  - OSSO BUCO, red wine-braised veal shank, polenta al formaggio, delicous, super tender.",

The best thing we had was the crudo, with a variety of raw fish. The pasta course had some good dishes (risotto) and some that weren't so good (lobster gnocchi). The meat course was the least impressive. Mediocre beef, pasta with way too much truffle (no idea why this was part of the meat course, anyway).  The real downside was the service. The waitstaff was VERY aggressive when leaving and taking plates, bumping everyone at the table, elbowing, had food spilled on me twice with no apology. Also, the sommelier was incredibly aggressive. After our dinner host opted not to order more bottles of wine, the somm came back again and seemed sort of put off, asking again about more wine, and when he was told again we didn't want a FOURTH bottle, he went to the opposite end of the table and sort of rudely put the wine list in front of individuals asking if anybody wanted glasses of wine. Very offputting. Not professional.",

Definitely a 'scene' and a beautiful view of the fountains. Ok for a cocktail. It's very very loud.   The food is gross. Everything comes out super fast - I believe it's all prepared and sitting under a warmer. Most of the hot food came out cold. SUPER small portions with each small plate costing about $19. The pasta tastes like it came out of a can; I didn't eat a single thing I liked. For $300 we had wine and 5 very small plates. No kidding.   Here is the thing - Vegas is home to world class dining. There are so many good choices... This just isn't one of them.    I'm currently en route to get a pizza someplace else. Don't waste your money on this shitshow.",

Hostesses gave away our table because we were about 10-15 mins late and claimed there was no where else to seat us for 2 hours until we told them we were going to go some where else. Then a table magically appeared and was ready for us. Weird. Bruschetta was good but thats pretty hard to mess up. Cannelloni was almost $20 for two thin pieces and it wasn't even all that good...the filling looked like cat food. Sorry nothing is worth that price for such a small size. Pappardelle al sugo bugiardo was tasty, but again over priced and small. If you want better tasting and more plentiful tapas style eating, go to Beauty and Essex. Their prices are similar but they at least give you a bit more food. I left feeling hungry and underwhelmed. Nice atmosphere and views of the fountain, but I would definitely not recommend or return.",

Also sucks cause we came here to celebrate my dads bday and left unsatisfied.   Zucca Allo Zenzero - One of the few dishes that actually was very good, it was a summer squash puree with ginger and spicy croutons for some added crunch  Bruschetta Al Pomodoro - Came with 4 pieces, the crostini it came on was crisp but chewy in the center. The diced tomatoes were light and refreshing and it was topped of with a drizzle of garlic oil and basil  Carpaccio Di Manzo - Served with big flat crackers and was kind of hard to eat since the raw beef was covered in arugula and parmesan (the shaved slices were too big and overpowering) we couldn't see that the beef wasn't in precut serving sizes it was basically just 2 or 3 really big ones laying on the plate so when you went to pick up some beef at first all of it pretty much came off the plate and onto your fork   Polio E Fregola Al Nero - The octopus was the best part of this dish it was sooo soft and probably the best octopus I've ever had but the squid ink couscous was so salty   Carciofi Granchio - The crab was very sweet and went well with the artichoke   Brasato D'anatra - Braised duck was tender but the cheese polenta it was served with was so overpowering all I could taste was the cheese",

I ordered the minestrone soup with no cheese and bruschetta as they made it vegan by also making sure there was no cheese.

You'll get to enjoy a nice view of Bellagio fountain and Paris' Eiffel tower, while having your meal. We shared a seafood salad (insalata di mare) and an antipasto platter (antipasto misto) as appetizers. The seafood salad had a refreshing taste from the grapefruit dressing and you can't go wrong with cheese and cold meat platter. For entrees, I had the sea bass (branzino livornese) and shared the octopus dish (polpo alla diavola). Both dishes were so tasty! Seafood was cooked right and tasted fresh. Flavor was just right. Really like these two dishes! We capped off our lunch with a couple desserts, which were not only beautiful looking, but tasted great as well. Our server was very attentive. Our water was never empty. Overall, I had a great dining experience here!",

The service was just okay. I feel like servers at an \"upscale\" place like this should have a bit more initiative.  The ambiance is nice and the fountains are neat to watch, but I'd definitely choose some of the other fountain-view restaurants over this. The music inside was also a bit loud for my liking.

The birthday dinner really looked cool and all our friends kept asking of what was that oval shaped next to the cake, they thought it was a Balut, commonly sold as a street food in the Philippines lol",

The entire experience was soured by being treated poorly by the wait staff right off the bat. We were ignored throughout the meal, and it took us 15 minutes to get our check. Once we had the check, it then took our bartender/waiter 25 minutes to process the payment because there was some sort of computer issue. Let me note that there was one other couple in the restaurant at the time. Right next to us, that other couple was getting copious amounts of attention/service the entire time. Due to the judgmental staff and non memorable food, we will not be back.",

We did get the bruschetta for an appetizer and it was not all that great. It needed some balsamic and mozzarella and not just tomato. For the main, I got the fillet with potatoes and asparagus and my husband got the same. It was cooked a perfect medium, which is what I prefer. We got the delicious chocolate cake dessert.

Our table was ready in 15 20 minutes. During the reservation I requested a table by the window and the staff took care of it which was perfect. Food and drinks were amazing. The star of the dinner was a side of sweet and sour vegetable. Extremely flavorful. This restaurant does deserve 4 or 5 stars. However, deducted 2 stars because our server was little rude and not very helpful. On asking for recommendations for food on the menu the server told us to go through the menu as it has info on everything  that they serve. The response was kind of rude. The water glasses were not refilled. For a restaurant like this i was expecting a better service.",

Lago serves small plates for sharing, think of Spanish \"tapas\", except Italian. They do have some \"main-course\" meals, which may make sense if you are eating alone, but part of the great appeal of Lago for my wife and I was being able to order a selection of wonderfully prepared dishes without stuffing ourselves.   When I made the reservation, I asked for a patio seat. It turned out to be one of the coldest days in Las Vegas. I asked the hostess if we should sit inside near the windows instead and she said that they heated the patio and suggested we take a look first. Glad we did. With the heaters we were comfortable. Some other folks had light coats on, but we had just come in from Minneapolis, so perhaps our tolerance for \"cool\" weather was higher :-)  I highly recommend sitting on the patio. Being able to watch the fountain as you eat really adds to the experience. Actually, I would only want to sit on the patio or next to the large windows overlooking the fountains. We had an early reservation, so had no issues having our seating requests accommodated (though I also make the request when making the reservation).   The seating in the front part of the restaurant might be okay if you are there with kids, but I would avoid it for any more intimate dinners.",

The roasted vegetables in the salad were just right.  We then had the goat cheese and fig pizza and it was perfection.  Finally, we had two pasta dishes - the lamb and the lobster. The lamb pasta was so great.  The little pieces of lamb were not gamey at all and tucked neatly inside the corkscrew pasta.  And the lobster pasta was beautiful, like a work of art.  You could tell both pastas were made in-house with love.  Our only regret is not making it to dessert.",

HOWEVER we just had dinner and would NEVER GO BACK! The noise level is OFF THE CHARTS!!!! Party of 4, literally could not hear across the table. Absolutely ridiculous!  The food was fine and our server, Nadar spoke loudly trying to compensate for the noise~ Granted its a Saturday night so be warned maybe it's better during the week....       1) Lunch is served till 2:30 & the Dancing Waters don't start till 3pm. This will be the BEST VIEW of the DW you will EVER have, so book a reso and be sure to request a table close to the window. All seats in dining area are pretty good, the bar area could be challenging to see.    2) Nice menu selections, tapas style. Full plate options available. 3 Course Lunch Special $28.00 w/o drink unless u have water~ I had the Minestrone Soup (REALLY DEEELISH!) Full of fresh tasting veggies, great broth with a dollop of pesto. It was chilly today so soup was a gr8 choice ~ Main course was the Branzino, cooked perfectly on a bed of baby tomatoes, asparagus & capers in a lite buttery sauce. The fish is the star here with the skin grilled nicely (easy to remove if you don't prefer it) The dessert option varies as it is a chef's choice, I indulged in a deconstructed Tiramisu which was OUTTA SITE!!! With dessert ordered cappuccino & it was good, however it was delivered about 15 min B4 the dessert was.    This is the reason 3 stars NOT 5 as the service was not gr8, and waaaaay to much time lapsed between courses, had to ask for lemons 2x's, Iced Tea never refilled. It's these little things that are not expected @ a Julien Serrano restaurant. Would never happen @ Picaso (which yes! I have been to!!) also Masa's in SF, where the service is and has ALWAYS been phenomenal!!! The server was nice enough, just not aware~     Lago's price point is classic Strip pricing. Cocktails $17.00, cappuccinos $5.25, I will say the Smoked Peach Margarita was quite good, and was not light in tequila ~ wasn't overpowering but I definatly wouldn't drink 2, then drive...",

    "text": "Seems like Lago has a few mixed reviews, but I thought it was Excellent!  I read some of the negative reviews, and they were regarding cost, or their reservation time or that they were 'under-dressed' and felt uncomfortable.  Well, if you're gonna go to a fine dining establishment, then don't wear cargo shorts and flip flops and you won't feel uncomfortable, lol.  I know this is Vegas where anything goes, but people, come on, this is a really nice place, at least dress up for it.  My date actually picked this place, and I was a little concerned that it would be an Americanized Italian place loaded with red sauce or grandma's \"gravy\", one of my least favorites things in the culinary world.  But no, it was actually REAL Italian, like from Italy.  So I was really happy and impressed.  Turns out, Julian Serrano is the Executive Chef, which makes sense as he's a great chef and a James Beard Award Recipient.  Even though he's not Italian, and actually from Spain, he's taken a Tapas-style approach to Lago, so you order a number of smaller plates, rather than entrees.  This makes for a fun dinner as you get to try a number of different dishes.  Was really great and tasty.  We ordered:  - Cocktails: Cucumber Mist (vodka, cucumbers & berries) & Rossa Bellini - were both excellent!  - Wine: Bottle of French Chablis, 2010 William Fevre - excellent, but Fevre is always excellent!  - Foccacia: Ricotta cheese with sea salt & honey - very good.  - Tonno: sushi-grade Ahi Tuna topped with orange segments - delicate and perfect.  - Beef Carpaccio: with shaved Parmesan & arugula - so rich & decadent...would even make Giuseppe Cipriani (creator of Carpaccio) proud.  - Funghi Trifolati: various Mushrooms sauteed in olive oil & garlic - so tasty.  - 7&7: Potato Gnocchi with Lobster Knuckles in a shellfish sauce - omg, the gnocchi melted in your mouth and the lobster had such good flavor, maybe my favorite dish of the night.  - Fusillioro: Abruzzo-style Corkscrew Pasta with Lamb Ragu and Ricotta Mousse...wow, delicious, and my 2nd favorite dish of the night.  - Giandujotto Dessert:  Hazelnut Cream on a chocolate shell and Espresso Gelato on a chocolate cake - both a perfect ending to a great meal!  The Ambiance was awesome and the style and feel of the restaurant is modern in True Italian-style, and GORGEOUS...no red checkered tablecloths here!  My date had requested a table next to the window where we could see the Bellagio Fountain Show in all it's glory.  Sounds cheesy, I know, but it actually wasn't - was pretty romantic actually.  Never thought I'd say that about something in Vegas of all places, haha.  Service was impeccable and the Head Sommelier, Jeffrey Bencus, knew his wine and had gone to the same Somm School as myself.  So, he brought us a few tastings throughout our meal of some really great reserve wine from the cellar - French Burgundies from the '80s & '90s, so that was really special...like REALLY, REALLY special, lol.  Thousand dollar bottles of wine were talking here, and of course, this was just a sip for each of us, but nonetheless, was phenomenal to have that tasting opportunity - thanks Jeff!  We had such a wonderful meal and evening, that we were the last ones in the restaurant, which was fun to be in such a nice, big place by yourselves, and they didn't try to rush us out.  And the cost is reasonable for a fine dining restaurant in Vegas - our meal for two with a bottle of great wine was $215, which isn't bad given the quality of the food, number of dishes we had, wine, service and ambiance.  So overall, Lago is a great place, and I almost venture to say that it's the best Quasi-Fine Dining restaurant in Vegas.  I say \"quasi\" because it doesn't have that formal or serious feeling of other fine dining establishments...like a Joel Robuchon at MGM (although I enjoy it there as well) and is slightly more casual, and fun!    Love this place!  Come. You won't be disappointed!...unless you're wearing cargo pants or shorts...then you will be, lol.",

    "text": "We came here with friends for a \"special occasion\" dinner. We arrived at 6:15 for a 7 PM reservation requesting a patio or window table. They called us at about 6:40 that a window table was available. No patio table would be open for another hour. We took our window table. Ambiance: The decorating is dramatic to say the least. From the moment you pass the hostess stand until you reach the floor to ceiling glass wall facing the fountains, each area of the restaurant is striking. Definitely 5 stars for the ambiance except for the noise level. Some people like the \"high energy, high noise\" dining experience. Not me. Food: Our server recommended 3 to 4 small plates per person. We opted for two small plates and one main course per couple. Good choice. Way more than enough food. We started with a pizza, fusillioro, mushrooms and the \"7&7\" as appetizers. The pizza was excellent despite the fact that it was served just slightly warmer than room temperature. The Fusillioro is a corkscrew pasta dish with lamb ragu and spuma di ricotta. This was my favorite dish of the night! The 7&7 is potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles. Another excellent dish. The mushroom dish was the only disappointment of the night. Bland and flavorless. The main course we chose was the Pesce Intero. This is a whole boneless white fish served with a generous portion of vegetables. A really outstanding dish with very high presentation quality. Yumm! Service: The only major disappointment of the evening. Our server was at our table fairly quickly. But then disappeared for long stretches. We asked to have the pizza served first. Instead, all 4 appetizers appeared at once (considering that the pizza was just about room temperature, I suspect it was ready much earlier). With all 4 appetizers being presented at once, our fairly small table became very crowded and hard to navigate. Our water glasses spent most of the evening near empty. I just about had to tackle a passing busboy to get them refilled once. They sat empty the rest of the night after that. Value: The presentation and taste of the food was really memorable, but the noise level and the mediocre service make this not worth the $75 a head that it cost. I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Ate here on March 29 , 2017 - made a reservation for 6:45, and luckily secured an amazing seat on the patio.    Food wise, the restaurant serves most of its portions appetizer size, so you'll probably need to order 3ish dishes per person to get full.  That being said though, the food is utterly excellent.  We ordered the ribs, scallops, rapini, duck, mushrooms, and clams.  The seafood was very fresh, and was, for lack of better terms, really really good.  The ribs were ridiculously tender - how did they do it!?  It also tasted incredible, and the duck was done perfectly as well.  I know rapini and mushrooms are just veggies, but they too were of the highest quality.  The dishes are around the $20 mark each, so it's around the same price as the higher-end buffets if you go with the 3 portions per person formula, but I'd say the quality is definitely a step up, even compared to a place like Bacchanal.  Service was excellent as well - staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and definitely added to a positive experience.  I'd be remiss to finish this review though without talking about the view.  The \"reverse\" view of the fountains, looking out towards Paris, is phenomenal.  I highly recommend getting to Lago a bit before your reservation to try and secure a patio seat - they're given on a first come and first serve basis, and for the most part, can't be reserved (you can make reservations for indoor seating, and getting there before your reservation time gives you a better chance of securing a patio seat in the event that one opens up).  It's hard to hear the music the fountains are dancing to from the patio (you can still make it out, but you have to try), but the spectacle is wonderful regardless.  I've posted a couple of pictures of the view to try and illustrate what it's like, but nothing beats being there.    What more can I say?  Excellent food, impeccable service, and one of the great (if not the greatest) restaurant views in Vegas - the best meal I had on my trip, and an easy 5/5.",

Brunch on Sunday was great! You choose a first and second course. A pastry basket comes to your table before that and dessert via a beautiful dessert buffet is open to you after the second course.  Bottomless mimosas or bellinis or bloody Mary's available. I tried the Bellini with peach and then with mango puree. The mango won! The bellinis are outstanding here!  My first course was the antipasto: really good. Everyone's appetizer looked amazing. For the second course, I ordered the chicken florentine... Wow! Delicious is an understatement. All entrees were delicious!  The dessert buffet is out of control!!! Everything from a chocolate fountain to fresh fruit to crepes to beautiful and divine cakes and pastries!   The not bad but not great:  - it took a while for us to get our bills and be able to pay.  -the restaurant was so crowded with tables and moving your seat was a limited ability. Maybe it was because it was Easter?  -pricey. If getting brunch with bottomless drink option, it is about $100.00 per person. Without it, about $70.00 per person.  - they initially did not want to seat us until our whole party was here. They were very nice about it. Some people were late. We were just waiting outside of the restaurant. One of our friends actually went up and talked to them and they finally sat us down even though we were waiting for one more person. I can see why they may want to do that, yet it is Sunday brunch and all you want to do is sit back and relax.  Overall, enjoyed it and would go back! Everyone was nice.",

We were greeted by the maitre'd upon check in and suggested to us to sit outdoors on the heated patio. The suggestion was spot on. There were enough heat lamps to make me warm although it was 45 outside and the view was spectacular. The fountains are directly in front of the dining area so one should try to sit on the patio.  The food is meant to be shared plates so order accordingly. It really does give everyone the opportunity to try a little of everything.  We started with orders of small foccacia; one  with fave been puree and pork cheek and the other was pecorino and green olive. Both were a great start to the meal to follow.  The scallop crudo with blood orange is so light yet bursts with so much flavor. The 7&7 is a must try. 7 gnocchi with lobster in a light sauce is perfect.  Spaghetti with Clams in tomato sauce was heavenly as were the Clams in a spicy white wine. The surprise for me was the Risotto in red wine and burrata. Very rich yet the burrata was a perfect compliment.  The service was extremely attentive as was the sommelier.  A definite recommendation for anyone in Las Vegas.",

You also have a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower across the street.  This is a tapas style place with a wide selection of delicious small plates, and plan to eat slowly in the company of friends.  The octopus was delicious, branzino excellent- actually all of the plates were very tasty.  Very nice interior decor.  Service was excellent.  Prepare to spend a pretty penny!",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday evening with a reservation for 5:45 pm (which I made the same morning) I was eager to sit on the patio however keep in mind it is VERY difficult to reserve a patio seat unless you talk to right people in the casino management (or you can try your luck but may have to wait)  ounce I arrived to the hostess I gave her my reservation and she escorted us outside to the patio but not before recommending dining slots are 1:45 minutes on the patio I explained to her I intend to have quite a bit of food and drinks and knowing how hard it is to reserve the patio in the first place I politely told her I'll take her recommendation into consideration but JUST as a recommendation the restaurant which is located in the Bellagio hotel is quite big and has a great view of the \"famous\" Bellagio fountains it has a beautiful decor which mostly consists of blue, white and silver accents it also has nice art work on the walls HOWEVER! Everything changes ounce on the patio this big 200+ seat restaurant transforms into this very small and intimate European feeling space with maybe 6 six tables your surrounded by water so close to the fountains you can feel the mist on your face and with the Eiffel Tower (across the street) and the rest of the Las Vegas strip as your back drop this patio is simply breathtaking..... taking all of this in while enjoying beautiful food and possibly too much of your favorite beverage this is by far the best way to watch and appreciate the Bellagio fountains   As for the food between the two of us we ordered four dishes plus dessert we started with the margherita pizzette which was definitely above average it was super thin and they make the mozzarella in house we also started with the burrata cheese which had a nice texture this dish was good but definitely not memorable after that we decided to try a pasta dish so we opted for the paccheri the red sauce in this dish was amazing however the over all dish again was good but not memorable after some more drinks we decided to get one more so we opted for the chicken livers it's served on crostini the dish had good flavor but was very spicy after few more drinks we decided that was enough savory so we decided to go with dessert we ordered the orange zest cannoli which was amazing the cannoli shell was really light and crisp   Over all we were here five hours I had to give it five stars due to the view and ambience the food it's self was good and better than a lot of Italian restaurants and maybe we ordered the wrong things but I did expect to be more \"wowed\" considering the chef is Juilian Serrano however everything considered in my opinion Lago is BY FAR one the most superior restaurants in Las Vegas because what it may lack in food compared to some others it greatly makes up for in view and ambience (if on the patio) but again the food was good just not as good as expected all in all it was an amazing experience",

I needed a break after a few days at a conference so my bf made a reservation and we ended up seated right next to the fountain (I thought he arranged it but it was just luck -- he should've taken the credit for it since I was really impressed!).  We tried a few specialty drinks and I think I found a new favorite -- he's going to try to make it for me but I'm going to hold out for another trip to Lago.  Since the menu was small plates we decided to share a bunch of different items instead of ordering an entree.  We shared the tripe (seriously, he made me try tripe), short rib cannelloni, duck over polenta, caponata and rapini.  While everything was great, we both agreed that the duck was one of the best things either one of us had ever eaten.  We fought over the last bite! One last note -- Fabio, our server, was charming and knowledgeable and paced our meal just perfectly!",

Our group of 4 was not impressed.  From the moment we arrived at 5pm and were told to wait to be seated?  The place opens at 5pm!  Seems that clientele must wait for a crew of hosts to decided to stop chatting amongst themselves and do what we paid far too much money for.  As the owner of a local technology security company, I cannot rationalize coming back or recommending to my family, friends or clients.  Far too much money for far to little and unremarkable food brought to us by wait staff that seemed more interested in watching the Bellagio fountain show than serving the guests that pay their salaries.  For what we paid here, we could have enjoyed 4 meals at less pompous establishments.",

    "text": "Food portion is tapas style so it's small snack size just FYI.  The restaurant was filled with more of an older crowd but the ambience was nice. It's located right beside Hyde nightclub.  Came with a buddy who happens to be a pro poker player. I will explain why this is mentioned later.  Had the mussels, clam, whole lobster, 7n7(lobster and potatoes) spaghetti di fruiti (spaghetti with seafood) and the Kobe beef.   mussels sucks. Don't get it.  Clam was really good especially the sauce.  Lobster was ok.  7n7 was the best dish, highly recommended  Spaghetti sucked. Wasn't stingy with the amount of seafood but the sauce was very lacking especially since I had similar dish at diners and Italian restaurants in New Jersey that were much more flavorful. It was what the server recommended  Kobe beef was good but very small. Maybe two oz at max.  My biggest gripe, and maybe I am being bitter about it was the service. My buddy who I mention is a pro poker player been to the restaurant many times which he mentions to the server. He tells the server that this is my first time on this restaurant and she needs to explain and provide service to me.   So in the beginning she was somewhat helpful with a great recommendation of the spaghetti which I will not recommend to anyone who bothers reading this review.  She asks what the occasion is for our visitation. And we tell her that our buddy is here for a poker tourney.  Her attitude immediately changes for greater once she finds out my buddy is a pro which wasn't a surprise. However the ditz completely disregards me and not once after asks if food was ok, if service is ok, if i needed anything. She asks him only if he wants desert. My buddy seeing the way ditz is acting asks me if I want deserts hoping she would get it but unfortunately that's not the case. I said sure and she brings out a desert menu which she lays in front of him and starts going over what's good.. Once again only to him. My buddy asks if I want anything and I tell him nope but she doesn't hear me obviously and keeps trying to recommend to my buddy what's good. We politely decline and ask for our check. Of course the ditz put the check in front of my buddy which I kinda took offensive too but whatever. We have it charged on the room and since it was my turn to pay for the tip, I generously gave her 15% which was 15% more than she deserved.  The helper? Who was dressed in black company outfit and not in a dress, was actually much more helpful and provided better service.  Sounds like I'm writing this review out of jealousy lolol.    I was taught that if you ever run across a daughter who you are interested but happens to be with her mother, you always treat and entertain the mother first and foremost. I hope the ditz get it one day instead of being blinded by greed for more tip? Or just trying to find a meal ticket out of her life.",

I thought the waitresses' blue outfits looked odd--it reminded me of Fifth Element. Overall, food was presented well and tasted delicious. There was a big group of us and we ended up ordering different entrees to share family meal style. We all loved the potato gnocchi and short ribs. Only problem is that the entrees were served tapas style, aka really good expensive food that can feed a small picky child.  Costed us about $600, and though food tasted great, we found ourselves still hungry. For $600, that's definitely not a good feeling you want to have after leaving a restaurant. Definitely not the place to go if you really want to eat. Stock up on snacks before hand if you really insist on coming here.",

    "text": "Overall I'd probably give this place a 3.75.  Ambiance - 5 Service - 4 Food - 4 Value - 2.75 Other - 2  Inside the bellagio, with a perfect view of the fountains. This is a pretty cool spot, that I probably don't need to visit again. Here's why: if you see my ratings above, I'll start with the 2 that I said for other. This place is too dang hot to be in nicer clothes lol. The heat plus the water, and a constant opening of the door to the patio, makes for somewhat of a steam box, not sure about the rest of my party, but I was pretty uncomfortable. I just want to be refreshed while eating, not sweating.  Besides that, the restaurant is beautiful, probably better to visit during winter months. Service is really good.  Now the food, they kind of have a tapas concepts in addition to a few normal main entree selections. Everything we ate was pretty good, my issue is with the value. The tapas concept is a lot of small plates, but here, all the small plates are on the slightly expensive side. Like $17 for a small portion of pasta or risotto. Thinking back to tapas in Barcelona, dishes were like $5-8 and you would get a bunch of items. I'm not going to get a bunch of $17 items....  That being said, we did have a group of 8, and we did share some amongst ourselves. My wife and I ended up getting the clams, the sauce and bread are perfect! I also got the seafood risotto which was good, but still hungry ha. Also got one of the pastas, again, pretty good but not 5 bites $17 good lol.  It's a nice place, just not sure I would be back.",

However, the food here isn't something I rave about.   started off with some bruschetta- the ripe, fresh tomatoes were delicious and flavorful. The bruschetta was simple but yet super tasty. It was served on top of grilled buttered toast.   steamed clams- the white wine broth was a little too light and the clams were a little fish tasting. There could be more seasonings to help mask the fishiness from the clams (perhaps some garlic)  steak- the steak was perfectly cooked at medium rare, but the sauce was way too overpowering and salty. It would have been nice if the sauce was a little lighter and the focus would be on the meat rather than the overpowering sauce.   seabass- the mild flavor of the seabass was a little boring. It could have use more of a springy lemon taste. It taste like seabass that was just cooked on a grill with no flavor.   Overall, Lago you were a beautiful restaurant, but little details of flavor were lacking.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in its service compared to my dinner experience here from when it first opened. Let's say.. What service? I was hardly acknowledged by the host. Why? is it because I didn't have makeup on? Because I look underage? because I'm dining by myself? I gave them benefit of the doubt since bar seating is open seating. Fine. About 5 minutes later, another woman walked in, definitely more mature looking than I was. She was definitely greeted by the same host. That host walked her to the bar seat and actually pulled out the chair for her. I had to scramble to pull the chair far enough to climb up myself and be able to pull it in. Nice way to discriminate, Mr. host. Furthermore, I saw some guys who had printed t-shirts and still get treated better than me. And what's great about dining alone? I'm drafting the review as it happens. Any check ins from anyone? Nope. My water wasn't refilled, no one really checked on me for finishing although I'm sitting at the bar and there are 2 servers attending. Way to go, Lago!  I ordered the zuppa allo zenzero, a summer squash puree with spicy croutons. Not sure why I was expecting a cold soup, maybe I thought of summer and needing to stay cool. It's definitely a decent soup. It's dense in texture but not too heavy. If you're craving for a light lunch, that would be perfect.  Also ordered the fusilioro, since I was craving for pasta. I was not expecting my pasta to come out at the same time as my soup. Yes, thank you for warning me about hot plate and such. I doubt my pasta would still be dangerously hot by the time I'm done with my soup.  Yep, it cooled down a lot when I took my first bite. It was a bit cooler at the top, still warm in the center though. Yes, aside from the fantastic service, the food here is still worthy. That al dente texture to the point. It's not soft enough to fall apart like how my life is from the eyes of that host. Lamb ragu may be a bit too gamey for some folks, but those loving fragrant (very subjective) flavors, this is worthwhile even I had to deal with that rude attitude from earlier.   So if you guys want to dine here with a decent experience, put some eyebrows on, ladies!",

We ordered 4 plates to share which were all delicious! The dessert we ordered was a little disappointing.

Our waiter asked if we were celebrating and did include a \"Happy Anniversary\" piece on the dessert which was nice. Overall I would highly recommend this place!",

We then tried the pork ribs alone and it was so tender and good. The plate was small though so it was gone quick. We also had the seafood risotto and it was awesome. Perfectly made and packed with flavor. We also ordered two desserts. The creme brulee and some chocolate mouse cake ish dessert. Both were good but I have to say I liked the creme brulee better. This place is a tapas style so everything is small and shareable. It's a bit expensive and our mojito cost more than the pork rib tapa that we ordered. If you're more on the hungry side order something from the entree instead of tapas. It was a beautiful experience here.",

Semi-casual attire is fine, though you're better off wearing at least business casual.   My dinner experience was alright. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't spectacular. The ambience wasn't as romantic as it could have been, due to the distracting music selection. There's a small \"outside\" seating area, but that section was closed off to the public for my night. My luck, go figure.   The bruschetta appetizer was small and had a distinct peppery flavor--a nice change, though I probably wouldn't order it again. I did enjoy my veal piccata though!

    "text": "Lago. (4.25 stars).  \"Lago: lake.\" - Google  I'm not 100% certain, but if I had to guess, Lago was given it's name due to the fact that it is faces the infamous \"Fountains of Bellagio\".  Hmm... fountain, lake, potato, potatoe??  I have been to Lago at least 10 times throughout my years of staying at the Bellagio & have enjoyed dining here for a quick meal or a \"date night\" with the BF.  While Lago is a primarily an Italian restaurant, Chef Julian Serrano's creative twist on these iconic Italian dishes will surprise u.  Over the years, I have tried numerous dishes from Lago so instead of trying to squeeze every single dish into this review, I'll review my 2 favorites:  Lasagna. (4.5 stars).  I love lasagna!!  Since I was a kid, that was the one meal I asked for everyday! Garfield was my hero because he got to enjoy lasagna all the time!!  On a recent stay at the Bellagio, our friends joined us for Sunday Brunch at Lago.  The first thing I saw was Lasagna!!  Not having any clue as to what twist Chef Serrano would give this classic dish, I just blindly ordered & prayed for the best!  What I got was a stunning & colorful dish which didn't look terribly familiar to me.  When I found out there were poached eggs served with this lasagna I started to regret my decision... until I took a bite into the lasagna.  This is where \"looks can be deceiving\" is so apropos!!  This lasagna was one of the best I have had.  Why?! Because the spinach lasagna is light & cooked al dente with a savory meat sauce. The poached eggs at a richness & classiness to this dish that I didn't expect!!??  The outer crust creates a nice textural difference to help contrast the creamy & silky lasagna.  Wow, I was blown away by the simplicity but depth of flavors!! Extremely light but just as good as the original!!  There's very little cheese in this dish but I didn't even miss it!  The only thing I wish I could have had was some type of familiar protein (i.e. shrimp or sausage).  But I truly respect Chef Serrano's genius & can still say I LOVED this lasagna!!  I'll definitely order it again.  Antipasto Misto. (4 stars).  WARNING: NONE OF THE OLIVES ARE PITTED!!!  I absolutely adore olives & cured meats!!  Who cares that it may take 5-10 years off my life?! I rather live happy then miserable.  Having said that, this appetizer is spectacular... well with one exception.  The \"cracker\" that is served with this appetizer is EXTREMELY THIN. While that isn't a bad thing in & of itself, it barely holds the weight of a piece of cured meat, let alone the cheese or olives.  When I try to \"spread\" the cheese on the cracker it completely falls apart & then my poor olive rolls off my plate & onto the floor. I have lost many a poor olive to this tragic demise...  Very aggravating & heartbreaking for someone who ADORES the flavors of this dish!!!  Perhaps, my uneducated & simpleton self doesn't know how to construct this dish any better but it is still worth the aggravation to make a perfect bite for the BF & I to devour.  Note: this appetizer is very messy to construct. The bell peppers, oils, & cheese are very slippery & virtually impossible to put together with the fork given. I don't allow the BF to touch the dish, I construct everything. Aren't I just so sweet!? *Angelic smile*  ---  I'm not a foodie. The True meaning of a foodie a person who is a gourmet or connoisseur!! I just love food (except fast food)!!  Lago is a wonderful place to come & enjoy a modern twist on Italian cuisine & to try some of their signature cocktails!!  Chef Serrano, a 2-time James Beard Award Winning Chef, is usually in the kitchen hard at work at either Lago or Picasso (where Chef Serrano is the Executive Chef) & I have had the pleasure of meeting Chef on a 2 occasions. A very humble & fun-loving chef!!  ---  Service is always pleasant & if u get a chance, request a seat in the back of the restaurant.  Why?? The Fountains of Bellagio will greet u every hour on the hour!  I tried the Serrano Negroni. Interesting, a little sweet for my palate but the BF enjoyed my drink. LOL. I'll be back to try another cocktail on my next visit!  Sunday Brunch is available every Sunday from 1030-1430. WELL WORTH THE $38/pp price! U can also add a BOTTOMLESS MIMOSA, BLOODY MARY, OR BELLINI for $28/pp. 3 course meal includes appetizer, entree, & dessert.  Gracias Chef Serrano for a marvelous dining experience that has been ongoing since April 2015 (when Lago opened at the now defunct Circo).",

I have read people saying it was very loud and noisy and they left still hungry. Maybe we got lucky but it was pretty quiet minus the music accompanying the Bellagio Fountain show and we ordered enough plates so we did not leave hungry. My husband and I are locals and made a reservation for yesterday, a Sunday, at 815pm. We were seated immediately and to our delight we snagged a table outside with a wonderful view of the Bellagio Fountains. I was worried I might get chilly but there were plenty of heaters so I was warm the entire night. I did my homework on Yelp and Trip Advisor so I had a list of 6 tapas I wanted to order. Our server was Fabio. He was SO kind and professional. He really was a delight and made sure to stagger our meal accordingly. We had the scallop crudo, veal ricotta pasta, 4 oz filleto, 7x7 potato gnocchi and lobster knuckles, short ribs cannelloni, and the meatballs. Everything was delicious. If I had to choose, the 7x7 was my least favorite but we still ate every bite so that should tell you it was still good. My favorite was the veal ricotta pasta, the 4 oz filet, and the scallop crudo. My husband looooved the cannelloni and filet and meatballs. We both had the LAGO cocktail. Mine was spicy, my husbands was the sweet one. So delicious! There was one younger guy in glasses who did a great job on clearing plates and our water was kept full the entire time. Pro tip: Ask for the bread! Fabio toasted it for us and we used it to sop up the amazing sauces that were left in all the dishes. :) We will definitely be back and we will be sure to ask for Fabio.",

I came here for lunch and got to sit next to the large glass window which faces the water fountain in front of bellagio. I was able to watch 2 of the water shows which was great because I didn't have to watch it outside in the Las Vegas heat. The interior of the restaurant is modern and clean.   Lago serves Italian tapa dishes. You usually order a few dishes to share with your table. Everything I ordered was something unique which I haven't tried before. I got 4 dishes with my boyfriend which was more than enough. We ended up having leftovers.  I think this is a great place to go if you're celebrating any special occasion like anniversaries or birthdays.",

We kindly got a courtesy call from the restaurant as a reminder and I thought that was a nice gesture they did.  Upon getting seated after checking in, we noticed our table was going to be right in between the lobby of the hotel and the edge of the restaurant.. We were hoping for a table more to the window side to see the Bellagio fountain but oh well. Because the wait time was a little longer than anticipated after our reservation time, we received complimentary champagne which was amazing!   We then got our drinks and food ordered shortly after getting seated. I ordered the Risotto Di Fruti Di Mare which comes with lobster, scallop, shrimp, clams and tomatoes. My best friend ordered a pasta dish. Both were amazing! I really recommend the risotto. Really well done and the right portion so you're not extremely full nor hungry. There is also complimentary house bread that was offered to our table. My other friends had steak and asparagus type of entrees. Unfortunately 2 of them got really sick from their steak and I'm not quite sure why or what happened but from my experience, this place was great for me. I like the ambiance and the relaxed chic vibes. Hopefully next time I'm able to get seated at a table looking at the fountain!",

Left super full and very satisfied.   The best dishes were the red wine risotto, a must get, and the 7 & 7 lobster pieces with toasted gnocchi. The octupus with squid ink and scallop cruddo was also good. The lamb chops were alright, had better. The prosciutto wrapped quail was rather a dissapointment as it was way too salty. The grilled mushroom were also very good. Overall, most dishes were very good. Had the panna cotta for dessert, it was very light, just tad sweet, amazing finish to the meal. The food, the view, and the service was amazing. Will definitely be back next time I'm in vegas to try other dishes.",

Started with the salami anti-pasto, overall pretty good, not too rubbery(!) like lost of the crap we get over here, followed by the quail (a little over cooked), best described as a paillard, two very thin filets, very tasty and a massive serving of the mushroom side which was excellent.  4 stars, mainly because a conference was in town so they had row after row of 10 seater tables to pack 'em in. VERY loud, with nothing soft on the walls at all.  Oh, and also had a lunch there: spaghetti frutti di mare was excellent, and a lot quieter.",

Seated right at out reservation time,  Service 9/10. The waitress and hostess were friendly, and they gave me a free birthday dessert. My water glass reached the bottom a few times though.  Atmosphere 10/10. Got to sit at the seat overlooking the Bellagio's beautiful fountain show. Room was pretty and colorful. Food was okay. 6.5/10  My favorite was definitely the speck pizza with ricotta cheese... Amazing!  The shrimp ravioli and lobster gnocchi weren't very good, neither was the beef carpaccio over the top. The charcuterie plate was decent, but not much to it. They are tapas portions, but very small and expensive. The dessert they gave me for free as a birthday thing was very bland and tasteless. Wouldn't eat it if I got it for free again. It wasn't an overall bad experience, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Could be considered subordinate to every other restaurant in Vegas.  Recommend: speck pizza, charcuterie   Skip: dessert, shrimp ravioli",

This dish had all the textures.   The crust on the bottom was life changing.   This dessert is so good it is worth going to this restaurant just to have it at the end of your meal.",

I suggest going off the strip. Staff that don't have a clue. Especially our server and the Manager. Food came out very late over 35 minutes for the first serving and at different times for the remaining hour. I  just wanted to have a nice dinner with friends and they had eaten and finished their dinner and my basic seafood risotto still didn't hit the table.  I have many qualms about Lago.  First the place is so loud you cannot speak to your company.  Second the service is pushed, too intense and not at all relaxing.  More importantly the food was just so so.  Small portions, way too small in my opinion.  10$ for three slivers of lettuce is a joke.  The Sea food Risotto was Chef Boyardee out of a can quality!!!  I hate going out to a place with mediocre food and leaving $150 poorer and still have to go eat elsewhere because I'm hungry 2 hours later.   Don't waste your money",

We checked in early for our reservation to wait for a table by the fountain, we were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes. We were seated in 25 minutes, but our table was right in front of the huge pillar, which made waiting for a window table pointless. We asked if we could have the table next to us, our host Sheyda went to check with the manager and came back and told us the hotel had reserved it. Then 10 minutes later she came back and told us she had appealed to the manager again and was moving us to the better table because we had waited for a table with a nice view. Sheyda didn't have to ask again, but she did and it's definitely the one thing that made the night extra special",

We had planned on eating at Lago because we had heard it was phenomenal. We had a group of 9 and our server asked us if we wanted to order on our own or if we wanted him to make us up a menu of the most popular items off of each of the sections on the menu. We opted to have him make us up a menu and let me tell you, it did not dissapoint. Every single thing that we tried was absolutely mouth watering. By far one of the best Italian meals I have ever had. All 9 of us left the restaurant completely stuffed!! My family and I are from Sonoma County in California and I wish there was a Lago around here so we could all go there again!",

First, this restaurant offers a magnificent view of the Bellagio fountains, which in itself is enough to make a dining experience elevated to a higher level. Then, our amazing server brought 8 different scrumptious dishes to our table. He brought them over one by one, tasting each one with anticipation to the next. Just when we said 'oh this is the best one' then the next one came and we said it again. It was indeed a party in our palates. Our faves: Polenta with duck, quinoa salad, eggplant Parmesan benedict and raviolone. Our server, Derek, provided such excellent service.

However, the food, especially for the price, was extremely underwhelming. Portions were tiny, even for tapas. After discussing the restaurant with the Bellagio staff, they said they have heard similar feedback.  I'm surprised that reviews have been  mostly positive. Desert was enjoyable,  best part of the meal.  Note to servers- At $15 to $20 a cocktail,  don't come and grab patrons' drinks without asking. Our unfinished drinks were grabbed without asking if we were done.",

    "text": "4 1/2 stars!  We chose Lago for our 5 year anniversary.  We had requested the patio, but in a freaky twist it was 55 degrees and windy mid May in Vegas so the patio was closed.  We had a lovely table by the window instead.  We did pop out on the patio for one of the water shows.  It is so lovely to view the fountains and strip through the window but the show does lose a bit of it's luster without the music.  So, choose the patio if you can, it's truly spectacular.    Inside is bustling.  The restaurant was busy and loud.  It is very modern and upbeat inside.  There is loads of cool decor, swanky light fixtures, bright colors and beautiful people.   It is definitely a different ambiance than other restaurants lakeside.  It is more casual if you want a nice meal without the full fine dining experience.    The staff was on point from start to finish.  The hostesses were friendly and talkative.  Everyone wished us a happy anniversary.  Our service was nothing short of spectacular.  Plates were cleared immediately, but not without asking.  This is especially nice when you feel the urge to lick the bottom of all of them!  Water was constantly filled, clean plates and utensils were brought whenever needed, help with the menu was offered etc.  I was really impressed with our service.  We wanted for nothing, yet they were not invasive.    We ordered the crab and farro salad, raw scallops with blood orange, salumi platter, eggplant caponata, meatballs, lobster gnocchi, and red wine risotto.  Everything was delicious.  Absolutely zero complaints on the food.  Many of the dishes were pleasantly surprising as the menu leaves most to the imagination.  For example, the eggplant caponata turned out to be a dish of chilled pickled vegetables with fresh herbs and raisins.  It was quite possible one of our favorite items but not at all what we expected.  I envisioned hot roasted eggplant.  The vegetables were cool and crisp and super flavorful.  The crab and faro salad was equally as flavorful, yet very light and refreshing.  It was coated in just the right amount of olive oil for a pleasant richness.  The raw scallops were like butter in your mouth but juxtaposed with limoncello and blood orange for a burst of citrus fun.  Again, we were impressed with everything we ordered and had zero complaints.  The meatballs were certainly the most heart dish.  Three large meatballs with scrumptious red sauce.  A good filler to balance out much of our lighter fare.  The sauce was yummy and I would have adored a piece of bread to sop the rest up.    Hubby has a nice glass of red wine.  I ordered a virgin passion fruit mojito.  It was so nice to have exciting choices of beverage for a pregnant lady.  Many of their cocktails had specialty syrups and sodas so it was easy to have a fun drink without losing all the pizazz.  My mock mojito had passion fruit soda, vanilla bean syrup, lime and mint.  It was literally gorgeous topped with a pineapple cone dusted in gold fairy dust and filled with sweet ginger.   It was overly limey at first but my server gladly added some syrup and redelivered it in a snap!    Alas, we were too full for dessert.  8 tapas for 2 was perfect and filled us right up.    There were main courses available if a guest prefers to avoid tapas.  The prices were surprisingly not bad on those.  For example, $50 for a 1 lb. rib eye with potatoes and asparagus or $28 for roasted chicken.    The strip is tricky because you are paying for location, location, location.  So, our lovely dinner cost us $200 for 2 with one glass of wine, and one mocktail.  The view was incredible, the food was delicious and the service was outstanding so I would recommend Lago to anyone for a very nice dinner.",

My reservation was on time and we were seated on a table overlooking the fountains at Bellagio, beautiful. Our server Mickey was beyond attentive and recommended to speak with the sommelier to order the bottle of wine for the dinner, which was, by the way, perfect for our meal. We ordered about 7 dishes, they are \"tapas\" style so portions are smaller than usual. They were all very well executed and flavorful, but my favorites were the 7&7, the cioppino and the canneloni, to die for! I'm not a dessert person but I wanted to have the full experience, what a great surprise! Definitely go for it. I totally recommend this place, you won't regret it!",

We made a reservation for 7:45 and got there at 7 to realize that our reservation has not gone through but were told that our table will be ready in one hour. We sat in the lounge and ordered drinks and appetizers. The server said the portions are too small and we need to order 3,4 menu items per person. That was not True and the portions were not that small. Overall they were trying a bit too hard to make you order more and more.  And they are not friendly at all and at times even rude.",

Having that said...Management at Lago are a piece of $#!+ (PoS). We made reservations the minute reservations opened over a month ago & physically went there the night of our reservations to request Patio/Fountain outdoor seating...They told us to come back 45mins after our reservation & the outdoor seating was ours. They call us 45mins later & gave us \"highchairs tables\" near the bar...It's Mothers Day Weekend & my Mom is reaching 80yrs old, how do you expect her to climb onto a highchair?!? Management tells me that the whole restaurant is booked & we just gave your seats and 4 other couples' seats to a party of 10 WITHOUT RESERVATIONS because we know large groups are better clients...Really?!? WTF?!? Don't give me a lecture on that type of research & statistics...I drop 10X the average US household income at the Bellagio & Aria every year and I don't have to walk around in large groups.  I feel sorry for the 4 other couple that took whatever crap management gave them...I literally had to argue with them to get a table & get off the high table w/ high chairs.  It was too late to dine elsewhere so we did end up dining there...The food is excellent (took pics of each dish), but so is Picasso at Bellagio Resort & Juslian Serrano at Aria Resort. It is mainly Italian cuisine served tapas style, so expect to order 5 to 7 dishes & one main-course per person. Enjoy the wonderful food, just arrive early to make sure you have room to put up w/ their crap...Or arrive in a large group & hog the restaurant patio WITHOUT a reservation.  Chef Julian Serrano, if you read this I challenge you to fire the manager that was working May 9th & let me (someone like me) take over, for a fraction of his salary...In return I ask for equity on that establishment. I assure you that if you don't put a performance matrix on management, they WILL bring your restaurant down.  Incompetent managers taking advantage of nice people = NO MORE Mr. Nice Guy!!! Definitely NOT coming back!!!",

    "text": "We go to Vegas minimum 5-7 times a year and we have dined all over Vegas.  This was one of the worst places we have ever dined.  The food is a joke.  I ordered the Papardelle with zucchini Ragu. Oh my god, there were literally 5 pieces of pasta in my plate. My husband ordered the Fussili with lamb ragu.  While the taste was not too bad, the size is ridiculous for the price.  Imagine a very small bowl (the small bowl is the center of a big plate - looking big but very small in reality) that was the plate. There were literally 10 pieces of fussili in the plate with some ragu on it.  My mom ordered something with mushroom which turned out to be a side (and the menu does not say side) and my dad ordered fussili as well.    Tables are a few inch apart and you can hear your neighbors conversations.  The waiters bumped into my seat like a million times (sooooooooo annoying).  The view is absolutely beautiful.  Staff was OK.  We had a reservation and we were seated right away.    I understand the concept of smaller plates and quality food BUT here they have really small plates with not much quality.  We have tried from the cheapest restaurants to the most expensive ones where you spend serious $$$$$ but this one is on the low end and we will not go back again.    We are a regular at the Bellagio (both staying and dining) but we will not go back again. Don't waste your money, go to Fix or other restaurants in Bellagio.",

    "text": "I had high expections upon attending Lago's NYE Gala. Everything seemed to go wrong. I did not feel welcomed as I checked in for my reservations. There was no warm greeting and absolutely a lack of professionlism coming from the host. I was not dreased in a suit or black tie such as others, but did not expect to be treated as if I was not a paying customer.  As we were escorted to be seated, the host stated rudely, \"Let's see what happens.\" I'm not sure what he meant, but when we saw where our seats were, I figured he was talking about the location of our table. Our view was obstructed from the fountains and there were not enough heaters to warm up the amount of people sitting outside.   You pay for the experience and most importantly the food that Lago has to offer. Here is a list of where Lago has failed to meet any paying customer's or foodie's expectations:  - cocktails (whiskey sour) were made incorrectly. Watered down and egg whiteless - bread was not offered - the oyster shooter was disgusting. Seemed like everyone around us ignored it, hoping it would be taken away - the lobster cannelloni was room temperature - the main dishes were okay, temperature was correct, but again had high expectations. Hoping that this main dish would save the night.   I bet it would have been a better experience for NYE if my money was spent on a table. Truly wished for a better experience.",

That in addition to superb service and exceptional food makes this one of my favorite dining options on the strip. I walked in and was greeted by two very friendly hostesses. I was meeting friends and as soon as I sat down a server handed me a menu and asked for my drink order. I had a mimosa which was made perfectly and garnished with beautiful sugar work and a glitter dusted raspberry. My server was so patient with me even though I changed my order and was very indecisive. I started with the ahi and then I had the eggplant parmesan benny. Definitely order the Benedict, it was to die for! I finished off with the desert tastings. I have to say I felt like an un-attended minor at a birthday party because I had no self control and had a little bit of everything! I loved that there was such a variety so it was good for everyone in our group. From fresh fruit to a chocolate fountain, they had it all. My personal favorites were the crepes and the fruit tarts.  Overall, would definitely recommend. Perfect for a girls outing or a cute date. This place will not disappoint.",

The reason of the 2 stars is for the way the manager handled things, the food deserves 0 stars; this restaurant NEEDS a new chef urgently. We ordered; 2 margherita pizzas $15 each RAVIOLI AI GAMBERI RISOTTO AL VINO ROSSO LINGUINE AL PESTO CANNELLONI  First the pizza was less than 8\" super skinny and flavorless, Celeste's frozen pizzas have more flavor. The canneloni was supposed to be PULLED short ribs, I received a disgusting dark paste inside two cannelonis, flavorless and definitely NOT fresh. The linguine was extra hard, no flavor, the ravioli tasted like COSTCO frozen shrimp ravioli. Honestly nothing is worth the price they're asking for. There's no creativity in these plates. The best thing about it is the environment, that's it. We complaint, returned our dishes and spoke to the manager. She covered the only two things that were eaten, which it was the pizza for our kids. Honestly, for an \"upscale\" restaurant in Las Vegas, dinner service should be made to impress, this was a total disappointment.",

He said \"no, that wouldn't taste as good, we won't do it.\" He then said \"I'm going to go take everyone else's order so you can find something else\" and moved on to the rest of the table.

We do not mind paying the price if the food is worth it. Lago is supposedly an Italian restaurant. We love good Italian restaurants. Judging by the menu, this one seemed promising. However, Lago's cuisine was just not up to par. I selected the mushroom risotto. The rice was undercooked and the whole thing tasted as if it had come from a dry food package.  No depth to it whatsoever. The same with my husband's small portion of pasta ai frutti di mare, which cost $29. I would not recommend this restaurant, and I certainly would never go there again.",

The \"small plates\" thing just didn't work for us. I felt that the food was grossly overpriced for what we were getting. I don't mind paying a lot for food, if the food is good and worth it, and in this case, I just really didn't think it was.   We ordered the margherita pizza, which was a simple cheese pizza fit for a 5 year old.  We also ordered the 7&7 gnocchi with lobster, the mallorados, filet, bruschetta, and the ravioli al gamberi.  All were good, and nothing was exceptional.  My favorite was the mallorados, even though someone else at the table said it tasted like hamburger helper. :/  Another thing I didn't like was the interior of the restaurant. The decor seemed tacky and overdone.  The tables were literally 6 \" away from each other so it felt like you were eating at your neighbor's table. Very awkward for conversations.  Overall I would not go back and would not recommend.",

What we noticed first off was the noise level... this restaurant is extremely noisy. So much so that we considered leaving. But we decided to stick it out because of the rave reviews of the food. The service was pretty good except for being asked by three different waiters for our drink order and then they got it wrong - diet soda and Pellegrino for one - they brought out a large bottle of the Pellegrino, which a single person will not be able to drink. We ordered Bruschetta Al Pomodoro, Cheese platter, Salumi - Cold Cuts platter and 7&7.  The Bruschetta was decent, not memorable. The platters were both good with nice selections of meat and cheeses.  Only thing was everything is dry on those platters, no jam or mustard to break up the textures. The 7&7 plate was tasty but the gnocchi was kind scrawny and deflated. We finished our dinner and hurried back into the quiet of the casino... yes it was that loud. Go to this restaurant for the view and decent food but not to have a conversation with your table mates.",

    "text": "We visited Lago for the first time yesterday. It is a very beautiful restaurant however the service and the food was not appealing in any way. For example, before we even sat down our waiter was asking us about water orders and then when we said we hadn't decided yet he didnt return for drink orders for over 10 minutes. Then, we were told that that the concept of the restaurant was to share food and that everything but the main courses would be small. That was a huge surprise seeing as a small pizza of four slices cost a minimum of $18. That means that if per person two dishes were ordered then $40 would be the minimum. Then, the server told us that the food would come out randomly whenever it was ready so some people had finished their meals before the last person even received their food. However, this was all relatively excusable if the food wasn't bland. My mushroom risotto was undercooked and had zero flavor. I added a boatload of salt and could not eat it. I had the food changed to a pizza instead since that was relatively good. However, all the other pasta dishes did not have any flavor and the sauces tasted like they came from a can. The last straw, however, was when we received the bill and it had my original risotto still on the ticket. Apparently it was \"forgotten\" to be removed but it seemed very scummy and the waiter did not even apologize. Tl;dr: Not worth the price. The service was rude and inattentive and the food was not good. Plain and simple.",

Terrible way to start an evening. Our waitress was friendly but had way too many table and I had to ask (2) different bellman for a club soda.   The food is less than average.

The atmosphere was one step up from a coffee shop, the services was only marginal at best, and the food was tapas style, which we did know in advance and sorry we picked it.    And, if you think you can have a conversation here with your friends and family, forget that.  Oh, you could beg to sit outside, which we finally did, because I was close to walking out because it is too loud.  The pizza wasn't very good and the chicken was dry.  For what we paid for dinner for the 5 of us was outrageous for what we got.  Oh, and here was the best part.  We ordered a couple of Caesar salads for the table and when we noticed that there wasn't salt and pepper on the table, we asked our server for some pepper.  When she came with the pepper shaker, she simply slammed it down on our table for us to grind the pepper ourselves.  WHAT????  For these prices she couldn't take one second and grind the pepper over the salads?  This was the icing on the cake.   I have never written a bad review on a restaurant before, but I did this time to let all of you know what to expect.    Again, if you want a lovely fine dining experience, don't go here, go to Le Cirque a few steps away.",

    "text": "Our dinner here turned out to be a disappointment and sort of soured our mood.  We did give the manager our feedback and he patiently listened and wound up discounting our bill.  For that, I'll give 3 stars.  The food was quite fine, but  the hostess and front-of-house service was lacking.  They simply don't communicate well and follow-up with reservations in a timely manner.  We made Open Table reservations at 630pm and didn't get seated until around 715pm.  A nice table by the windows to see Bellagio water shows wasn't available and would be 10-20 minutes wait.  Instead they had a hightop with stools available.  So we waited for a nicer table but after 20 minutes it was going to be another 15-20 minutes.  We wound up taking a table near the bar with no view.  Guess making reservations isn't useful here since they don't understand the concept of putting a reserved sign near the good seats.  If its first come first serve, why bother to accept reservations at all and keep our hopes up?  As for the food, the best dish was the Grilled Octopus with squid-ink couscous. Definitely a masterpiece with char-griled tender octopus and savory, briny couscous - it gave us both black lipgloss but was totally worth it.  The 7x7 (7 gnocchi and 7 lobster knuckles) was also good - with a nice buttery broth.  The other two dishes were mediocre.  Chittara and clams was cooked al dente but seemed a tad on the salty side.  The Branzino had a nice flavor and seasoning on the tomatoes but the fish itself was a bit under-seasoned.    Our waitress was very nice but she forgot our crab farro salad and then didn't give us a pen when we asked for the check.  The busboys were great at refilling our waters and clearing the plates - so they probably deserve the best praise with respect to service.  The manager did discount our bill, which was honorable and a welcome gesture.  Still, with the fierce competition in Vegas for restaurants its doubtful we will return.",

Our server Michael,(if I remember correctly) was experienced and attentive. We started out with the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad and the salad with crabmeat and grapefruit like dressing. Delicious, Light and on point. For dinner we had the branzini with a light tomato sauce and  a side of roasted potatoes. We were very satisfied but our server recommended a nice chocolate dessert and we split that. The portions were all appropriate.

I had the antipasto, four cheese lasagna and tiramisu. While my wife had minestrone, branzino and tiramisu. Each was delicious and beautifully plated. Although the wafer thin flatbread served with the antipasto was too delicate to be functional as a vehicle to transport the burrata and prosciutto to my mouth without casualty. The red sauce served with the lasagne may have been the most flavorful I've ever enjoyed. But....the service blemished what would have otherwise been a stellar experience.  Our server, Paul O seemed overwhelmed or at least distracted. We asked for water with lemon - water arrived - no lemon. Twice more visits to our table by Paul before lemon were provided. Later I had finished my iced tea and requested another - it never arrived. On another occasion Paul brought an I Pad to our table for wine selections - we were finished with our entrees and were awaiting coffee and desert. The pace of our meal included an inordinately long delay between our first and second course - the kitchen was not busy - so I suspect Paul failed to put in order to fire our entrees timely. Too bad - ruined what would have been a five star experience ( and the Bellagio fountains we not even operating at lunch time).",

As we were hungry, we both ordered 4 dishes. ....and that's, what we didn't like so much (only 4 Stars instead of 5), we suddenly had too many dishes on the table at the same time. Some of the food got cold before we even could taste it. I also think, that the Dessert Menu could be bigger.

We noticed that people kept getting seated ahead of us. The staff was rude, and they were basically ignoring us. We ended up leaving. Maybe it's because we didn't order drinks at the bar, and they thought we wouldn't be spending much money. I left upset and hungry.",

The restaurant is LOUD - as in, I had to almost yell to be heard across our small table.  It isn't because of loud music, it's just the din of everyone talking - everything seems to be hard surfaces and magnifies the noise.  The food was fine but not great.  It's served in small plates, family style, so you can try lots of things but I would say only about 1/3 of the things we got were super tasty (favorite - meatballs, least favorite - branzino and caprese salad).  Nothing was terrible, it just wasn't remarkable.  Our waiter was a bit rushed in his interactions with us, and he also missed ordering one of the items we had asked for.  We had a full meal for two, one glass of wine each, and it was $200 - so pretty pricey too.  Bottom line - I think there are better choices for a couple's dinner with all the other great restaurants in Vegas.",

Aside from its exquisite aesthetic, Lago exudes such a young, hip and lively energy. As expected, the staffs, the service and the food are top notch. Everyone from managers to servers to bar tenders are professional and pleasant. As for food, the meatballs, braised short ribs & grilled octopus are highly recommended. Lamb ragu pasta is amazing. Another must have is the Salumi platter. Love the rosemary porchetta. Yum. If you're a pizza lover like myself, the margherita won't disappoint. The dough is light, fluffy and full of flavor. Can't wait to try other dishes. So many dishes but so very little tummy!!! Bye Lago. See you soon!",

But the food was extremely disappointing. We had the crostini with chicken liver. It was overly salty and didn't have a lot of taste. We also shared the salmone which was actually ok , but also had very little taste, which to me means the salmon wasn't that great in the first place. Quality salmon should melt in your mouth and have a rich flavor. Next we tasted the gnocchi with lobster and then the shrimp stuffed squid. The gnocchi appeared cooked and then broiled, which I know can be done, but shouldn't be. It tasted like they had cooked the gnocchi earlier in the day and then reheated it to get a bit of a crunch.  Good gnocchi should be light and tasty. This was chewy. The lobster tasted of nothing. The shrimp stuffed squid was the worst dish of the evening. The squid was super chewy like eating a rubber band. Very unpleasant. The dish also had very little flavor. If you are use to good food then go elsewhere. If you like Olive Garden then you are probably ok eating here.",

    "text": "Very disappointed and surprised this place gets such high ratings, unless we went on an all-time-low day.  I made the reservation over a month in advance for 7:30 pm on 3/14, specifically requested patio seating and as it was my 50th birthday, I noted it in my reservation.  My sister and I arrived and settled in our hotel faster than expected, so we called Lago to see if we could move our reservations up a couple of hours, which they said was possible.  When we arrived, there were only 2 tables seated inside.  We were told there was only a table inside available, but it still had a view of the fountains, so that was fine, although we saw open tables on the patio.  Everything went downhill from there.  Our server, although there were only 4-5 people inside, was disinterested, almost to the point of annoyed.  We weren't told the specials and when a new table was seated behind us and told the specials by another server, we eventually asked ours what the specials were.  He said there was only one, which was a plain pasta dish with shaved truffles for $55 and that we probably wouldn't be interested.  Pass.  We started by ordering a few dishes, a glass of wine and a mixed drink.  Where to start...  The wine was a seriously small pour, but okay, it's a \"high end\" restaurant and that happens.  The mixed drink was 3/4 crushed ice, but tasted okay, but 3/4 crushed ice, which doesn't leave a lot of room for the actual drink (3-4 large sips for $19).  The food was terrible - period.  One item was the duck.  The description was not accurate and it came out as an overpowering muddy/stroganoff'ish mess atop polenta.  This combination did not go well together, as they were both strong flavors, which do not compliment each other at all.  Since the plates are so small, after we took a spoonful each, there wasn't much left in the original dish.  My sister and I were commenting to each other about the disappointing experience and turned to see the server and manager glaring at us and rolling their eyes from across the room.   The server came back and asked if everything was alright.  I stated the duck was not good, and he was not happy.  He took the plate and again, we watched the rolling eyes from across the room.  Since the small amount of food we ordered wasn't good, we decided to just get a desert and end it.  Big mistake.  We ordered the creme brulee because I love all things creme brulee and have never passed one up, ever... until this time.  It came out as an almost solid clump of butter with still crystalized sugar, which sounds delicious, but it was not.  During our meal, another couple arrived and was seated next to us.  This was the only positive experience from all this.  They were a very sweet couple and asked if what we were eating was good because it \"didn't look right\".  They said they had eaten there on a few other occasions and this time was not the same.  When the server finally came back, we said the brulee wasn't right, and the couple seated next to us concurred.  He said, \"so you don't want it then?\", looked flustered and took it away.  Again, rolling eyes from across the room.  He came back after some time and said, \"the manager agreed to take the desert off your bill\", like it was a favor.  We had taken 2 bites, so it's not like we were eating everything and then wanting it for free.  No happy birthday... nothing but attitude.  When we were leaving, the manager just stared at us from the hostess podium, so I felt compelled to say what a terrible experience it was.  He actually looked annoyed, but did say sorry - definitely not convincing though.  Thanks for making my 50th birthday celebration dinner so awesome.  I had been looking forward to it for months.",

It's got a youthful, fresh vibe inside and amazing modern architecture. On it's opening night, we had the pleasure of sitting on the patio overlooking the best view of the Bellagio fountain show. It's pretty much right on top of you. The food is, of course, unreal (wouldn't expect anything less from Julian Serrano). And the service, of course, impeccable. I'd recommend starting your night off with the Sgroppino cocktail. An explosion of prosecco in your mouth. Literally, it's a frozen sphere. As for the food, here are just a few of my favorite dishes: The chicken liver crostini, gnocchi with blue cheese, slow-cooked short ribs, lamb ragu, and the salmone crudo. Those are only a handful of the many small plates offered, but you really can't go wrong here. Lago is a perfect new addition to Bellagio and to the Vegas strip.",

We were seated right away for our reservations even though the place was very busy. The restaurant is very bright, not your typical Vegas dining so we were kind of caught off guard by that. But nonetheless, it is gorgeous inside with a beautiful, contemporary feel that has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. They do recommended 3-4 plates per person but I think that is kind of a lot for two females. We had the bruschetta, margarita pizza, red wine risotto, lamb ragu pasta and the filet with Gorgonzola cheese. By the time the filet came out we were already so full. We didn't have anything to drink since we were going out right after but some of the neighboring tables' cocktails looked amazing. Our bill came out to be around $80 which we thought was pretty cheap with the quality of food. Everything tasted amazing and I cannot wait to come back again. The lamb ragu pasta is a must! Probably one of the best pastas I have had. Also, the margarita pizza was amazing too.  The service was awesome too. I'm very happy Bellagio added this new restaurant and I think it will be doing great there!",

    "text": "We ate here on Easter Sunday for dinner and had a wonderful experience. Our reservations were for 845. I really wanted to sit outdoors so that we could be located close to the bellaggio fountains show. Initially they told me it would not be possible but I could wait 15 minutes for a table with an inside view. After the short wait they were actually able to place us directly on the patio at a front and center table with amazing views of the fountain show. These seats were incredible and I highly recommend asking for outdoor seating in advance or possibly showing up early to see if they have any outdoor seating that you could wait for it. Our waiter Fabio was top notch. Great personality but really knows his stuff. He made the fine dining experience personable while still being formal, something that often lacks at higher end establishments. We ordered the bruschetta and also the Burrata. Both were great/ We then ordered the 7&7 gnocchi plate which was delicious and the mascarpone and shrimp stuffed pasta which I thought were just OK but which my husband enjoyed. The icing on the cake was the amazing Desert we got after just casually mentioning it was our anniversary. Fabio picked up on that and brought out one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had in my life, pictured below. Great food experience as well but feel like the service and environment is what made this place five stars instead of four.",

Also, the food has some good flavors I especially enjoyed the (small) fungi and the branzino (fish).  Things I didn't care for were the lobster/seafood risotto which had 1 small piece of lobster in it. They should call it the shrimp risotto. And the $12 caesar salad which was 5-6 small pieces of romaine with dressing, cheese and anchovies dumped on top. We sent it back. Also don't order the pizzas, they are 4\" (literally, I'm not exaggerating). I have been to my share of 5-star restaurants including Pizza Mozza in Hollywood, where they make their pizza bigger than that.  Service was average, nothing to ride home about for the prices. It is supposed to be family-style but I was never offered a fresh plate or utensils. Most of my group was disappointed and it didn't make me look great since I was the one who found Lago on yelp. I know Vegas is expensive but I also expect to get quality when I pay for it. I did not find that at Lago.",

We were looking for a place where they would have entertainment, good food, and outdoor seating. We were promised that the Lago would have a very good entertainment program and for a hefty additional fee, they could guarantee an outdoor table. Which we have agreed to pay.  We made reservations for 10pm. They seated us on the outdoor patio. All the New Years decorations were inside, none were present outside. They had a DJ again inside, but nothing for the patio. They distributed party favors inside since 10:30pm, they did not get to the patio area until 5 minutes before midnight and at which time they ran out of men's hats.  Many of the outdoor heaters were not working. The fix menu was OK. The kitchen lost all the tickets so the food took for ever to get to the table. We ordered Champagne at 11:30pm so we may get it by midnight for the toast, we did not get it until 12:30 after repeated requests.  To add insult to injury, at 1AM they started putting all the lights on and the few outdoor heaters that were working,off.  They wanted everyone out.  In conclusion, food average; service, entertainment, embiance all MEDIOCRE at best.",

    "text": "I want to start off saying I had the most lovely brunch today at Lago @ the Bellagio. I am a 32 year old female who dined with a friend just before we had to go to the airport. I have been living in Chicago for 10 years now--so I've eaten at some great places--and do not consider myself a foodie, but I like to enjoy a nice meal and finally have the means to treat myself (or Treat. YO. SELF.).  We made reservations for 11AM because we obviously wanted a fountain seat. We were the first people at the restaurant and were greeted by the entire staff + Julian Serrano as we walked in. And from that point forward we only had exceptional service. I have tons of severe food allergies (where I have an epi pen) and they were more than accommodating.   THE FOOD This review is for Brunch only. It's a pre fixe menu for $38/person. You get a fancy pastry basket, plus you get to pick 2 items from a list on the menu: I went for the duck and then the steak--I will say that some of the items are non traditional breakfast items and seem a bit on the heavy side for breakfast. But HELLO, I am also on vacation and why not?! Everything I ate was outstanding. I am not sure why people are complaining about this food.... can you cook this yourself, I would like to ask? Where are you eating that you are getting this type of food that is cheaper than $38/person? A side of bacon in Chicago is $5. So yea.... not sure why anyone would be complaining. We also got the $28 \"bottomless mimosas\" which also works for Bellini's and Bloody's. Most places do not let you cross order between drink types if they have a \"bottomless\" deal going on, so I was impressed I could order all three drink types (or more!) at the $28 price. Personally I think that was also a great deal, especially for Vegas, where I spent $19 on a cranberry vodka at The Encore Beach Club. And it was THE FANCIEST mimosa I have ever seen. It had a gold dusted raspberry on it! And it wasn't short on booze at all!   THE VIEW We got the middle seat on the patio aka the best view in the house. If anything, it was worth just going to see the fountain show with music playing in the background. What a great view! I also think the restaurant is beautifully decorated. SO FUN!  BOTTOM LINE If I am ever in Vegas again, I would absolutely stop in for dinner. In 2015, I think in general, people's expectations for everything have gotten a little unrealistic that basically everything is a let down. I honestly have never seen or tasted a mimosa like the one I had today (there was gold on my raspberry!) in front of a beautiful fountain, on a sunny day, on a beautiful patio, with music playing in the background, eating steak, getting waited on. If that isn't worth your hard earned money, than I am not sure what is!",

In the beginning, I was told they were tables on reservation only but then the story changes when I asked about future reservation that they cannot be reserved.. hmm.  A couple was seated at one of these tables 5 minutes after us, definitely not high rollers, told us that they had no reservations, and just \"got lucky\".  I felt like the hostess was playing a game. It's a casual place but make sure to dress like a high roller so that the young inexperienced hostess can treat you like one.  Other than that, kudos to our server and the chef(s).  We couldn't complain about the food or the service after that.",

The views of the Bellagio fountain alone is worth coming but the winner here is the food. Great quality and taste. Please check out my photos. We ordered 4 small plates to share as appetizers, caprese salad, chicken liver pate, mushrooms and bruschetta. My main was the most excellent seafood pasta. I ask for a dinner size and they easily accommodated. We had 4 deserts to share to finish off.   I have been to Vegas many times and this restaurant is now easily in my top 5. Just wonderful.

    "text": "Perfect date spot - just be sure to make reservations and ask for a table with a view of the Fountains at Bellagio!  My husband and I ate here during the week on a recent trip to Vegas, making reservations about one day in advance for a late dinner.  The view of the Fountains during our meal was spectacular - I would recommend asking for a table up front towards the windows or on the patio for the best of the best.  The service was nice, but not as personalized or as steady as we expected.  Our server forgot to put in our appetizer and salad orders, and was slow to bring drinks from the bar, but overall he was polite and knew his way around the menu.  We had the Bruschetta as an appetizer, and it had a nice little kick to it from the garlic oil, then had the minestrone soup and the Ceasar salad as our next course.  The minestrone was extremely light but flavorful, and the Ceasar salad was crisp and nicely dressed - having those two dishes for lunch would definitely be a great idea!  We stuck to traditional favorites for our entrees, and the lasagna (not sure they have it every night), and the pappardelle did not disappoint.  Both were filling and you could really taste how fresh the pasta was.  I would recommend either one if you are going to have a multi-course meal, because even with all of that food, we still had room to try their gelato and maybe an extra martini or two.   Overall, the beautiful atmosphere and view of the Fountains is probably enough to make us go back to Lago again (it truly is one of the most romantic restaurants we have been to in awhile in Vegas!), but it's the fact that the food is so fresh and so delicious that makes us want to recommend this restaurant to others as one of our new favorites in Vegas.  Cheers!",

We selected Raviolone which is stuffed with egg and truffles and my daughter loved it! I had the salmon salad followed by the Frittata which was scrumptious. The service aaa also excellent and the best part is the view of the Fountain show! It was stunning! Highly recommend!",

Everything tasted rather bland. I definitely don't mind spending a pretty dollar for a fantastic meal. However, I found this particular meal to be rather boring.Looking forward to trying other fine dining spots on my next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I was recently in Vegas with a large group (over 20 people) and was pleasantly surprised when I found out we would be dining at Lago for dinner. This place was on my list, so getting to check it out was fun!  First of all, the decor and ambiance of this place is top notch. It's gorgeous on the inside and has floor to ceiling windows that provide a good view of the fountains from many of the tables. We were seated directly across from the bar close to the pizza oven (so about halfway into the restaurant) and could still see the top of them. I would not want to sit at the front of the restaurant because it's open to the casino and just doesn't seem quite as special.  Second of all, the food! I enjoyed almost every dish that we ordered. The plates are small and pretty pricey, so take that into consideration (the 4 star rating), but hey, it's Vegas. It's kind of part of the whole deal. We ordered... - CAPRESE - MARGHERITA PIZZA - RISOTTO AI FUNGHI E PARMIGIANO - FUSILLIORO - GNOCCHI ALLA ROMANA (My favorite... like clouds!) - COSTA DI MANZO - SCALOPPINA DI VITELLO (the only thing I didn't eat bc I don't eat veal) - CHEESECAKE  I would definitely recommend this place for a True Vegas dining experience. Get a table close to the fountains for sure. You can even order a $60K bottle of wine while you watch! :)",

I think there are ideas that I would take into my own home one day. For example, the chrome shelving at the bar with the white background pops!  If it is a nice day, it is nice to sit on the Patio, but it's also nice to be casual and sit at the bar. No bad options here.   For the food - I really like the tapas idea since I'm always one to share and try many dishes during a meal.  Some of my favorites:  -Caesar Salad with mini hearts of Romaine -Caprese, simple but flavorful -Braised pulled duck meat with polenta - Like butter!  -Italian Fries - Yas!   Lago started to serve Brunch and I need to check it out soon!!",

I love nothing more than sitting on the Lago patio nearest the rails looking out at the fountains with the Eiffel Tower in the background. The wonderful wines they serve paired with the delicious food designed by Julian Serrano, and served by the fine staff are the highlight of our every visit. Our Brazilian waiter was knowledgeable about every item on the wine list, and dinner and dessert menus. He provided excellent information that guided us to perfect selections. Everything was so delicious. We can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Lago is fantastic. Call before you arrive at your hotel to make a reservation so there is not an issue, it does get crowded and sold out. It is located at the Bellagio, a beautiful hotel. The location is perfect. If you want to sit near a view of the Bellagio fountains ask, speak up.  Please do not go dressed in shorts looking like you are on line at a cheap buffet. Dress for the occasion, wear a nice pair of pants and anything other than flip flops. This is an expensive place to eat, it is beautiful, the food is great, so treat it as such. Everything on the menu is wonderful. Try a steak and a fish dish. They have a pizza oven and I am sure it is great, but I did not have pizza, so I don't know. The service is wonderful, you are well taken care of and they make you feel special. If you are there for a special occasion let then know before you are seated.  I would not take kids here. You can, but they are going to get bored, you will be there awhile.  They have wonderful desert items. If you can afford it have a bottle of wine, but I don't think their list is the best and it is very pricey. I rather spend my money on the food, oh the food. But you do what you want. They have a full bar with great drinks. You will be there for an hour or more. It is not that they are slow at all, the food is perfect and you simply are not rushed. If you are in a hurry, go elsewhere. Enjoy.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch on a Sunday thinking I could order the agnolotti.  Sadly on Sunday at lunch they served only a brunch.  So I tried the brunch and came back at dinner the next day for the agnolotti.    The brunch rated as a 4 stars.  I had the mixed antipasto Italian meats.  Basically some very good prosciutto and excellent salami.  That salami was divine.    I then had the eggs and Applewood smoked bacon that had a very small portion of gratin potatoes.  The two eggs were sunny side up although I had asked for over medium. Eggs tasted good, bacon was delicious and had a strong smoked flavor.  The potatoes were ok.    Someone in group had the duck on a cheesy polenta. I got to taste it and it was delicious.     The dinner rated a 5 stars plus.   All the portions are small so you get many different tastes as I ordered a four course meal.  Again I had the mixed Italian meats as an appetizer. Most excellent!  Then I had the veal agnolotti in a meat sauce.  It was delicious, as good as the finest restaurants in Turin Italy where I first tasted this dish.  I get tired of American Italian restaurants always serving most of the pasta dishes with a tomato based sauce.  This beef based sauce had no tomato in it and was the consistency and taste of gravy. My next course was the veal piccata.  The sauce was excellent.  The veal delicious, great flavor and the only criticism I have is that the veal was not tender.  It was still a great piece of meat.   Dessert was a German chocolate Black Forest cake with cherries.   What a dessert!  The wine was a glass of Barbera D'Asti, a deep red wine that had a dark berries nose.   At $110 per person it was a bit expensive but then this is Vegas!",

I was a guest of a group of folks that I do business with, and the host ordered in Italian to the head chef, so I am not a great resource when it comes to the menu or pricing.   But... I can speak to the fact that I tried probably 15 different plates throughout the evening, from a caprese appetizer with caviar on top (!) to gnocchi to steak to sea bass to a Black Forest dessert that was the perfect capper. And every single dish was perfection. I love being able to share a wide range of plates with the table and these plates were beyond well executed. They were perfection.   The view of the fountains was lovely, and we could feel a fresh breeze coming off the patio. The service was impeccable and I could not have asked for a better evening! Please, go and enjoy every moment. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Luckily we were seated just right next to Lake Como in a glass enclosure to protect us from the Vegas heat. It's nice they had a pre fix menu since I was on a tight budget. My friend ordered the pre fix menu as well with his being the steak and I had the fish.   The waiter was attentive and quick to check up on us to see how the the food was. The pre fix menu consisted of an appetizer, entree and dessert with each having at least 2-4 choices. It was nice to charge the meal to the room so I can use my resort credit to comp the meal. Overall, Lago won me over with their food and ambiance, for sure I'll come back and try their other dishes.   There's an outer patio overlooking the fountains just as you leave the enclosed patio. Unfortunately no fountain shows were happening at the time.",

    "text": "Be careful not to trust them when calling ahead to secure your reservation. Push for a \"contract\" or risk being downgraded to a crummy table, even if you were promised something better.   I went to Lago with a large group for a birthday party. Unfortunately, the manager and greeters were not what you'd expect at a high-end restaurant. I called ahead and made a reservation for a large group. I explained that I was trying to organize a special night for a birthday party and really wanted to secure a table with a view. The individuals I spoke to assured me that I'd have a table next to the window. I was told that I didn't have enough people in my party to make a group reservation, but that we'd be \"taken care of\".   I arrive at the restaurant and the manager or some guy in a suit tries to pull the old bait and switch, seating us in some weird booth table away from the windows. I went to speak to the guy in the suit to explain that we'd like the table, which was clearly open and available in the middle of the room towards the window.   His response, that table is only for groups who reserve it in advance. My response, we reserved this well in advance. I printed out and showed him my reservation confirmation. Then he changed his position and said that the large table by the window is \"under contract and reserved for another group that's coming in\". Perhaps that's True, but my group had specially reserved it as well. After some debate, we were permitted--like the red-headed stepchild--to sit in the table in the front, but we were rushed through our meal to accommodatee the other party who had the table \"under contract\".   Our waiter was extremely nice and the food was good, which is why I am giving two stars here. Otherwise, I was unimpressed with the restaurant's attempt to downgrade our group and pull the bait and switch, especially with my considerable attempts to coordinate with the restaurant before the event. It's not like I showed up without a reservation. I must have confirmed at least three times prior to that night to ensure that the restaurant and I were on the same page. Instead of ensuring that we were made to feel special, we were cast aside. That's not the way a top-tier restaurant should make customers feel.   I encourage Lago Restaurant executives to get your staff better trained in fine dining and customer care. Your team could have and should have planned ahead to accommodate these seating requests. We arrived at the restaurant around 5:00 pm and there's no reason why you couldn't have arranged three large group tables in the middle of the restaurant. The initial treatment we received nearly ruined the night.",

Being from Europe this was not an authentic experience, but rather an American wannabe restaurant, unfortunately. Very small portion sizes, for $25-45 a plate, almost like everything was appetizer portion (this is no Guide Michelin restaurant, you can't do that here!). Service was horrific. Our first server decided to leave during our dinner without notifying us, which resulted in 3 different waiters all \"trying\" to take care of our table. Rude waiters, and did not care to refill our drinks at any point. An overall very bad dining experience at supposedly a fine Italian restaurant, in a prestigious hotel. If you are looking for an authentic European experience, avoid this restaurant at all costs!  An extraordinary view over the strip though!",

If you're lucky enough to get a seat by the window, you're in for probably the best dinner view in all of Vegas. We watched the fountains go off numerous times as the sunset throughout dinner, and it was amazing.   Of course, food is just as important as location, and Lago has that under their belt! To start, we ordered the olive Focaccia for the table - definitely didn't realize how small it would be. It was yummy, but essentially as big as a slice of toast. For the main, I ordered the Pappardelle Verdure which was amazing. It had a slightly spicy sauce, can't remember if it was Arabiatta or Marinara, but it was great. The veggies were perfectly cooked and still had a bite to them. I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots, but I greatly enjoyed it in my pasta here!   We didn't order drinks the day's drinking had already taken a toll on us, but the cocktail menu is extensive and all the drinks looked fantastic. Will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas - hopefully I'll have room for a drink!",

    "text": "I was looking for a perfect place to take my gf for her birthday breakfast in Vegas and I didn't want to go to a buffet or go far off from the strip.   Luckily I found Lago! I made reservations weeks out because I heard that it gets filled up. We got there, asked for an outside reserved table and it was awesome!   We got an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain and the music that it plays with the dancing waters. We were seated outside where they had misters so it wasnt hot accompanied with shade. A heads up though, if you decide to choose outside seating, there might be mist splashing to you when the dancing waters gets close enough and high enough but it's not so much mist that you are anywhere near wet!  Now on to the food. We got steak and eggs with Hashbrowns and a tuna carpaccio topped with a citrus. Both were delicious and refreshing! You can't beat a classic! They also had an AYCE dessert with a chocolate fountain which is a nice and surprising touch to an otherwise, amazing breakfast restaurant.  Service was awesome and attentive. We had an overall great experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

Pros:  Ricotta cheese and honey on focaccia bread  corkscrew lamb ragu pasta  View of fountain show at Bellagio   Cons: Waiting for ten minutes after having reservations Food did not come out in a timely manner Risotto frutti de mare - watery and rice was so soggy/ soupy Shrimp stuffed squid - nice bite but no flavor  Mushrooms - need more salt  Some of the dishes were too one dimensional, not enough bold flavors and the dish came out a bit too hot.   The staff not being as informative and attentive.  Overall, would I come again? Probably not.",

Now the location brings this restaurant over the top, directly in front of the water show it was beautiful as you walk in look to your right, that wall of wine and champs make for the perfect photo op.

We were promptly seated right on time of our reservation in the patio where we enjoyed the dancing fountain show. The wait staff was witty, knowledgeable, personable, & very well likable. His recommendation on the plates were excellent. The sommelier's recommendation of champagne & wine was just perfect. The speed of delivering the food, filling in water , drinks, all just perfectly & expertly served in the polite & friendly manner.  After having wonderful (& enormous) brunch at Wing  Lei earlier, we were concerned that we might not be hungry enough for dinner . But this place was just perfect for our party of six. Highly recommend!!!! 5x starts in every way. Wish their continuing success for years to come.",

The desserts were amazing!! We ordered the coffee & chocolate and limoncello desserts, loved both of them but the limoncello one was definitely my favorite! The Service was overall good, had to remind the garcon to get me some water a couple times, but the restaurant was very busy on NYE (understandable, but not an excuse).

We had a reservation at 7:30 but when arrived on time, they had problem locating it and I saw the same happening to other parties.  We ended up not seated until 30 mins later.  It was lots of confusions from one hostess to another.  We were then directed to their outdoor seating but since it was a windy evening, the fountain show canceled, otherwise it would have been a perfect spot to watch the show.  Instead, all we experienced was wind, dust, flying napkins and some circling flies above our table.  The flies told me something is not clean at the restaurant.  On chilly and windy evening like this, I suggest them to turn the outdoor heater up higher or just not offer outdoor sitting since it was hard to chew without dust flying into our mouths.  The tables and chairs were dusty too.  I was worried that my dress would get dirty. The foods we ordered were fair taste but a little pricey for the portion.  The cocktails were good.  The server we had disappeared after dishes served and never checked back until dropping off the bill.   Overall experience was not up to my expectation considering the $$$ spent.  With the many restaurant options on the Strip, I will not return to here.",

When we got there at 2 it was near empty and we were seated near the window. We were not given the pre fix menu and when u asked for it was given a \"oh I will have to see if I can do that\" I said it's on your website and he very snotty like said he would check. We quickly realized we were not fancy enough for them. He ended up bringing us the menus. We ordered. We also did not order drinks and he pushed them on us and then we were dead to him once he realized he was not going to be getting much out of us. But at $28 each for lunch it's not like it was a cheap meal. the food was okay. looked very pretty and fancy but just ok. Dessert was yummy. Luckily the fountains start at 3 that day so we got to see at least one show right as we were going to leave. It was an amazing view for lunch and if I had the money I would go for dinner!",

Our request for a table with a view of the fountain came through and we were seated at a nice square set up where we could all easily share dishes. We got to enjoy the fountain show all dinner long.    The first thing to know about this place is that it's a tapas place so most dishes are small shareable dishes. Each of those will run you from $12-27 each. Larger entrees are available for $50-65. Most of the dishes were tasty. Some of the food that stood out for us were: Braised duck over polenta 7and7 - lobster and gnocchi though I found the gnocchi to be overdone.  Grilled octopus with squid ink pasta  Clams in spicy sauce Cappuccino mousse dessert  They added a few dishes for Thanksgiving: Butternut squash ravioli - quite yummy Turkey dish with green beans and sweet potato puree was okay Pumpkin tiramisu was good  Service was excellent and super attentive. I did appreciate all of their great service on a evening that they could have been spending it with their family. Many thanks and happy Thanksgiving!!",

After we were presented with the bill and no birthday wish or birthday cake or anything I asked to speak to the manager who was FABIO RUSSO, he made the situation worse by listening to what I had to say and saying or doing absolutely nothing about the situation. He could have cared less! I felt like I was talking to a wall. In my opinion and I have owned and operated many restarants, FABIO RUSSO is unfit for the job, get rid of him, he is ruining the busienss and the brand. Needless to say my sisters birthday at LAGO SUCKED!!!!",

    "text": "They say to order 2-3 dishes per person because the courses are, \"small\". The first dish to arrive was the wagyu beef. When it arrived we were underwhelmed. The taste was subpar, and we could barely finish not even half of the wagyu. The waiter (AFTER we ordered) informed us that the wagyu beef was supposedly the only dish that came in larger proportions. However, the next dish to arrive was the burrata. When it arrived it too was larger than we had expected. Our waiter, Monique, argued back and forth with us that these were how the dishes are supposed to come. At this point had we known the proportions would be as large as they were, we would've ordered the pasta and nothing more. It tasted mediocre, and the accompanying crackers to the wagyu and the burrata were the same. Which tells us the variation between dishes were uninventive. Next was the chicken liver spread. The presentation was good, however when you bite into the crostini it's very hard. The pepperoncino was excessive, and made it extremely spicy. A smaller amount would've enhanced the course. Finally, the seafood bucatini arrived. The taste was decent, especially in comparison to the other dishes. Overall if you're looking for great Italian food, this is not it. We now see why it was ranked number 7 in the search for Italian food in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Want to experience Michelin starred and James Beard awarded rated Chef Julian Serrano's culinary offerings in the Bellagio?  Oh, chef's name may invoke his Spanish heritage and one's thoughts go to dishes that would include chorizos, sangria, tapas or paella. But, think again...you're IN THE BELLAGIO!  So, in Lago, you'll find Chef Serrano's bold Italian cuisine for brunch or dinner service.    We came here to experience the Sunday Brunch that was highly recommended by friends and the hotel's concierge.  Reservations are definitely recommended.  Upon approach, this bright space and colorful mosaic (of Milan) attracted us from the casino.  We also noted that a dessert display had been set up at the front of restaurant.  There is also a lobby or lounge to wait for the rest of your party to arrive as the hostesses won't seat your party unless everyone is present.  As we were guided to our table, past the bar and lounge area, we could see out of the huge glass window from which we clearly viewed a panorama of The Fountains of Bellagio.  During our brunch, we watched the fountains dance about to popular or classical music selections.  Our friendly server described the fixed Sunday 3-Course Brunch menu which included a basket of assorted Italian breakfast pastries AND a \"visit\" to the dessert display.  For a few dollars more, you can request unlimited Bloody Marys or Mimosas with your brunch which makes more sense than ordering by the glass.  We each selected our 1st and 2nd courses from the menu while munching on the pastries set at our table and sipped on our coffees or cocktails.  The third course was a trip to the luscious dessert bar which we did our best to save room in our stomachs for.  The nice thing about the 3-course brunch is that the portions are sensible and satisfying so you won't feel like you'll go into a food coma.  The authentic Italian flavors can range from bright to bold which are great for waking one up.  This was a sophisticated and enjoyable Sunday Brunch which we shared  with good friends over a stunning view of Lake Lago and the famous Bellagio Fountains.",

I made a reservation a week before and we were sat almost immediately upon arrival. We got a really nice seat, two tables from the window. We picked a time where the fountain shows were just starting so we got to see a beautiful show every 15 minutes.  The service was not the best I have ever had. I felt like our waiter paid more attention to the table next to mine. The restaurant wasn't that busy either so I kinda expected better service. We waited for a water refill for a long time.  The food however made up for the service. We had to try the small plates so we had a few of those along with one regular dinner plate. The Gnocchi with lobster is a must. The lobster was delicious, and the Gnocchi was one of the best Gnocchis I have ever had. The veal was a little too sour for my taste, so next time I will pass on that. We also had one of the sashimi plates, which was melt in your mouth. A little pricey, but delicious. Finally, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed that dish.  The plates were small, but full of flavor. I think ordering a few small plates and one side is the perfect amount of food for two people.   The meal was quite pricey, but with the beautiful restaurant, the wonderful view, and the high quality food I will definitely be back for more some day. It was a wonderful experience and I cannot wait to bring some friends.",

    "text": "We were fortunate enough to be able to score a same-day reservation for dinner on a warm Thursday evening. What we didn't know was that somehow, we were able to get one of three best tables in the house - the front and center fountain facing balcony tables! What an amazing view and experience it was.  DECOR The ambiance, decor, and atmosphere of Lago is clean, bright, with a lake house feel - more so outside on the patio than in the main dining room. The balcony overlooking the famed Bellagio fountains was a treat. An additional element of our experience was having a front row unobstructed view of the Bellagio Fountains show every 15 minutes!  FOOD Lago by Julian Serrano is an Italian Tapas-style restaurant with a focus on fresh seafood dishes created with style and bursts of flavor. For libations, we tried a selection from the cocktail menu: the Lago cocktail and Sgroppino for her and the Rose & Rye and the Serrano \"Leather-Aged\" Negroni. Our dinner consisted of five tapas: Pesce Al Cartoccio, Brodetto Di Vongole, Capasanta Alla Putanesca, Hamachi Crudo, Oysters, and a finish of an amazingly crafted limoncello dessert.  Our first course consisted of Kumomoto oysters and Hamachi Crudo. The oysters were fresh, crisp, and had a tangy red wine mignonette accompanying them. The take on the Hamachi was also refreshing; Dressed in a fresh cucumber juice, spicy oil, and micro greens, it was bliss on the palate. Our second course consisted of a traditional clams dish in a white wine braise and scallops in a tomato boquerone sauce. The clams reminded me of fresh buckets of white wine garlic clams I used to get growing up at the Redondo Beach Pier. The scallops were prepared perfectly and paired well with what I thought would be an overpowering combination of tomato and boquerone. Our main course was the fresh fish of the day en papillote, the branzino. The branzino was accompanied by a caponata, and while not being a huge fan of eggplant, I loved it!.  The grand finale was the dessert. I would suggest this, along with the creative cocktails, was the stars of our meal. This dessert was just called 'limoncello' but it was so much more. It combined elements of limoncello, pastry, chocolate, and fruit that had us wanting to order another.  Every dish was a creative use of fresh ingredients highlighting the main ingredients. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our meal from the moment we stepped up to the entry, throughout our meal with the Bellagio fountains dancing in the background every quarter of the hour, to the dessert.",

The view of the Bellagio fountains is spectacular. We were seated right by the window and saw three different versions of the fountain show.   We each started with a glass of wine and the ricotta honey focaccia, which I highly recommend. I had the mushroom risotto, and my husband had the ragu - both excellent. We ate everything and then each ordered creme brulee. Plus, I ordered the after-dinner coffee drink.   I researched menus and places to celebrate a special occasion in Vegas with a view. This hit on everything I was looking for and the price was in line with what I expected for such a meal. The service was also spot on from the hostess to the clearing of our plates. They have it all covered here.  Make a reservation and enjoy!",

We also tried the Ceasar salad add salmon to it.  Very nicely dressed light and filling.  The fruit de mare pasta was a little too spicy for me but I finished it. Just had to drink a lot of water.

Then... why only 3 stars? Because for me the experience is also important... it all started good... we got a great waitress (who, by the way, had served my wife and daughter the night before), but even before we could get our drinks ordered, she was changed to a different area... and the new waiter even though kind, seemed new and/or stressed. Then, I ordered a Lagavulin 16 (single malt scotch, for those who may not be familiar with it). When he brought it, it tasted like Laphroaig 10. And, don't get me wrong... I like Laphroaig 10 too, but that was not the taste I was looking for. I brought it up to the waiter's attention and he was kind enough to bring the Lagavulin bottle and gave me a taste from it, and... it definitely tasted different. So, I asked him to please replace my drink. Which he did promptly and I was able to enjoy my Lagavulin 16 taste... All seemed ok... then why, again, only 3 stars??? Because when I got the bill there was a $4.00 difference on the price of the Lagavulin. And again... don't get me wrong... it is NOT about the $4.00 dollars! It is about the principle! I was not going to be that customer who complains about the $4.00 dollars.... after getting our waiter changed and getting the wrong drink, this was the \"drop\" that spilled the cup... not worth a fight or complain, but enough to leave a \"3 star only\" taste in my mouth!",

A reservation is a must in order to get a window seat though so plan ahead. The food was good, small plates described like you're eating at an incredibly authentic Italian restaurant but are lacking just that tiny extra taste to send them into the \"delicious\" category. For small plates they actually are generously sized for two people. The bruschetta is a must and the meatballs are really yummy. Lamb ragu was good, I would have preferred different noodles, the spirals made me think of Kraft mac and cheese but the sauce was great. Skip the seafood salad...the grapefruit was overpowering and the shredded veggies were blah. Bread and oil are brought to the table only by request so be sure to ask!",

    "text": "Pssstt, Julian, stick to tapas!  My wife and I love Picasso and we've eaten at Julian Serrano's about half a dozen times.  \"Go check out Julian Serrano's at the Aria,\" we tell people when they ask us where to eat.   We'll make sure to tell them to stay away from Lago from now on.  I've already gotten some rather brutal feedback on my review so I'm editing it to provide more information as to why we were so incredibly disappointed with our meal at Lago.   First and foremost, service was extremely spotty.   We were initially seated at a table, immediately told to move as there could be no table there as it was blocking the doors onto the balcony.   We were moved to a table nearby only to see that a new larger table of 6 was dressed exactly in the same spot some 15 minutes later.   Perhaps they didn't want to sacrifice such \"prime\" real estate on a 2-top, but we certainly felt slighted to say the least.   For the remainder of the meal, it was evident the servers were much more interested in lavishing attention on larger parties.   We asked twice for water refill while our glasses remained empty.   Sorry, but that just doesn't fly.  The food was simply not all that spectacular.   The octopus dish I had was rather chewy with a rather crude presentation, in my opinion.   The polenta might have been the highlight of the meal, but that's really not saying much.  In all fairness, it's perfectly evident that an extraordinary Spanish Chef can create incredible tapas but he may not so easily be able to create such exquisite Italian dishes.   If you want incredible French fare, go eat at a restaurant run by a French Chef.   Same goes for Spain, Italy, or Thailand.  Considering we dropped close to 5 bills on our meal here, we had much higher expectations.   Of course, many things can be excused.   Perhaps the sous-chef was ill that day.   Nevertheless, the lack of culinary depth combined with what we thought rather poor customer service made that we certainly won't be coming back.",

The decor was really fancy and classy. It felt super up scale. Our server was great too. He was really attentive throughout our meal and was really helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  We chose a bunch of different dishes and shared family style.  Highlights: The Agnolotti. Wow. The insides were just so smooth. I really enjoyed this.  We tried the different pizzas. I like the salsicca the most. I didn't think I would like the pizza as much as I did but it was a good addition!  The bistecca was too cooked for my taste. It was medium :/ I didn't really like this.   The sea bass was great. It tasted really fresh!  Overall, a really good place. I would love to come again!",

The restaurant has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain from the inside. The restaurant even queues the music to match the fountain when it is going.   The food itself is wonderful. I really liked the gnocchi dish and found it to be delicious. All mainly small plates to great for sharing. Service is also good. Had servers both times that were attentive but not too much lingering.   Hit this place up for sure when dining in Vegas!!",

    "text": "Ambience: 5 Food: 4  Service by Monique D: 3  I could rate it an overall 4 stars but taking into account the type of restaurant this is and what I expected of it I shall give it 3 stars instead. My pasta ai frutti di mare was delicious but the veal piccata just had too many capers for my taste. From that dish all I could taste was lemon and capers.  Also take into account that the dishes do not come with any sides; those you need to order separately.  For dessert I had their Gianduiotto and it was beautiful, refined and had a nice flavor/texture combination. But would I order it again? Probably not.  As for the service I'd say it that although sufficiently efficient it was as impersonal as it can get. Monique D, at least three times, left me with half my question still being processed by my brain. That's unacceptable. She had two tables, both close, so I know it was not because she was 'on the weeds'. Was it because I'm young and look like I could also eat at Pizza Hut? To top it off, when she dropped the bill, she had charged one of the items as if it had been dinner time and it was not. The difference was small of course but still a mistake. I did not tell her to fix it (she was not around much), nor did I tip her my usual 20%. Hope she gets better at her job, smiles once in a while or just considers changing her job.",

    "text": "Ok. It's the belaggio we know but c'mom absolutely overpriced for what you get.    Loud loud busy ambience.  The fountain view is pretty. Service is hit and miss. They bus your table like a living on land octopus hands in and out everywhere- getting things you want takes some time.   The wine stewards are exceptional though.  Granted a 130$ bottle of champagne is 40$ in the store they do jump for their money.    A lot of pomp and not much oomph at this establishment- the entrees are expensive. Decent not mind blowing. The so called shareable dishes are funny. 6 of us barely got a bite of some of the items.     6 gnocchi balls 6 lobster knuckles the same size as the gnocchi were 22$  we're not cheap but was shocked tasted very good even though I almost missed it as I chewed 3 times and down it went.    I don't mean to complain about Lago it is Vegas and it's all about excess and spending but next time we will skip this fine fancy sexy establishment with lovely plates and very nice Turkish cotton napkins which I wish I would have stole at least one if not a pair.      So if you wanna be a big spender go a different route.     But the baked fish was yummy and the crepe brulee was pretty damn good. Very very worth it.   Good luck in Vegas.   Good advice: Don't take the cards they are handing out - downtown they will give them to you. Like reverse pigeons",

    "text": "The food at Lago is definitely five stars! I've never ordered anything that wasn't top notch! The first time I went there, I ordered the branzino livornese. I loved it! The only other time I've had branzino was at Bardot brasserie and theirs was terribly bland! The one at Lago is definitely more flavorful! I took a bite out of my friend's dish which was the Crusted Salmon and oh my, that was is also bursting with flavors! If you want to order a fish, I would definitely go for either of those two!  My second time around, I went with their three course tasting menu and ordered the caprese salad, Petto di pollo ripieno, and the hazelnut cake. My friend ordered the tonno and the anatra e polenta. The caprese salad was yummy! The tomatoes were fresh and so was the cheese. It had the perfect amount of saltiness. The chicken was a little overdone but still flavorful! The mashed potatoes that came with it was amazing! It was creamy and the sauce on it was just yums! No words could explain it. My friend's duck dish was also delicious! If you had shrimp and grits, it's kind of similar. I would want to order it next time. The two desserts I've tried is the hazelnut cake and the panna cotta and both are exceptionally delicious!   So the jist of it all, everything was flavorful and delicious. Docking off one star because I literally had to hunt down just to get a water refill and that's my biggest pet peeve. You should always keep the waters and drinks filled.   Oh well! I will definitely be coming back in the near future.   ANATRA E POLENTA",

    "text": "So we made reservations at 10:15 but had to wait 20 extra minutes to be seated by the window for the most beautiful Las Vegas view.  Lago is a newest restaurant by Michelin Starred Chef Julian Serrano; located in the Bellagio, which is a new rendition of a contemporary Italian themed Cuisine which just opened in April, 2015.  THE STAFF -  While our servers were not on their best behaviors, the food picked up their charm. The tables are so close that the waiter's  butt kept jabbing me to assist the table next to me and he never said sorry, it almost felt like he wanted his butt in my face!   THE FOOD -  Pasta fagioli e cozze -  this soup with muscles which my dining companions couldn't stop raving about. It was delightful and had a bit of clean yet rustic flavor without being overwhelming with salt.  I had their Cesar salad, and I rarely compliment salad dishes, but the seasoned sardines blew me away, it was really magnificent.  The texture of the vegetables and croutons was one of the, if not the best mixture I've experienced from a salad dish.  Risotto di fruti di mare - My second course was the Risotto, which was probably the best risotto dishes I've had in Las Vegas, with elegant and aromatic flavor and impeccable texture of the farro. I hadn't distinguished what trick the kitchen pulled off, but the king oyster and maitake mushroom tasted almost like a flawless grilled meat, with smoked macadamia and crispy leeks to support the mushrooms.   Pesce fish - orata which was perfectly cooked but the reserved yet elegant flavor of curry broth added another dimension to this dish and the flavor was modest without being salty.  I would definitely recommend coming here again.  It's my top 5.",

Otherwise, it's not worth it.   Now this is why I'm eating it only 2 stars.  There is a lady that comes by your table to take photos of you. That is so touristy and cheesy. Makes dinner awkward and not as intimate. I mean we're just at dinner, do we really need to be this cheesy?!   Second,  The food is garbage. The Cesar salad was tasteless. The bruschetta was the only okay thing we had ordered. But again just okay. I ordered Pacherri de Telefono, baked pasta. Ummm.. did it ever come out! It was the smallest dish I had ever seen. It was like an appetizer for maybe 2 people.   My hubby ordered Pappardelle Al Sugo Bugiardo. It was a sauce. There was 1 strand of think pasta in it and the rest of it was roasted veggies in tomato sauce. We make better pasta at home.   I also ordered a cucumber mint drink that tasted awful. I took maybe 2 sips and left it hanging.   Then, the bill. We skipped dessert because I'm sure it wasn't going to blow our minds.   But... the bill! Was $95.00  For lame pasta and sauce- gross salad   I can't believe how $$$ this place was for the quality and quantity of its food.   I would watch the fountains outside for free.

    "text": "Lago is my favorite restaurant on The Strip. I should note I don't eat beef so if steak is your thing, this is probably not the restaurant for you. Also, if you want a giant pile of food on your plate for relatively short money this is also not your place. But if you like to tapas/small plates style of eating or if you don't want to leave feeling like you might burst then go here.   Lago puts you eye level with the water show so ask for a window seat. It can be a bit loud in the restaurant during peak times (acoustics, not blasting music or anything like that) but if the weather is not too hot you can ask for outdoor seating and it is much quieter outside. It's the best outdoor seating on the Strip, and there's not a lot of outdoor seating on the Strip! Book in advance if you want window seats or outdoor seating. (Another good thing about Lago is it has a bathroom IN the restaurant so you don't have to walk out of the restaurant and into the casino. Which might not sound important, but it sort of is. Also, it is a really nice and private bathroom! Though, they do use sage scented hand soap which is the bane of my existence....)  I like to dress up and you won't feel overdressed at Lago if you want to get dressy. But you don't have to. Casino's will seat people wearing just about anything, so smart casual is fine.   I would get a reservation for any Strip restaurant. You can always cancel if you change your mind.   I love the food here. There's a sister restaurant in Aria- Jullian Serrano Tapas- which is equally good but is interior to the casino so has no views.",

The pesto didn't even taste like pesto...it tasted mostly like oil. There was almost no basil flavor to it. For what I paid, I was kind of annoyed by how bad the food was.

I was lucky enough to get to attend the Gold Elite event held at Lago the previous week, so I knew I was in for a great meal in a beautiful setting. My expectations were met and then some.   We arrived promptly for our 6 pm reservation and we were lead by the personable hostess to our reserved table on the patio, overlooking the famous Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower across the street at Paris. The manager came over to thank us for celebrating our anniversary with them, and then our server, Carlos, proceeded to explain the menu to us.   Lago is Italian themed tapas, so many of the menu items are intended to be shared, and very few of the items could be considered a meal on their own. Carlos explained that items are brought out as soon as they are prepared, and recommended we start with a couple dishes and then order more as the night went on.   Service was impeccable. While Carlos was our main server, we interacted with various other employees as food was brought out to us and dishes were removed from the table. Everyone was fantastic.   My husband and I started out by sharing a few items and then decided to move on to 2 of the larger entrees. The insalata sarda was a wonderfully light dish to start off with, and I loved the way the brown sugar and balsamic brought out the flavor of the ricotta infornata. After sampling a couple more items we moved on to our entrees, my husband had the polletto and I had the filetto. My steak was such a deliciously tender cut of meat and gorgonzola with red wine reduction topping was to die for.   We could not resists sharing a dessert after our entrees, we went with the panna cota which was a wonderful combination of vanilla and citrus. Our server Carlos said it was a favorite of his, and that was a wonderful recommendation on his part.   Lago was an excellent venue for us to celebrate our marriage, and a lovely addition to the Bellagio property.",

    "text": "WE LOVED LAGO! My parents and husband and I celebrated my mom's 65th birthday at Julian Serrano's newest restaurant in the Bellagio, and they showed us the best time. Memorably warm and attentive service, memorably dramatic and beautiful fountain views, and memorably fun and satisfying dishes.  We had chicken liver crostinis, guanciale and fava focaccia, green and white asparagus, margherita pizza, corkscrew pasta with lamb ragu, risotto with red wine and burrata, potato gnocchi with lobster knuckles, and the softest meatballs, and this--about two dishes per person--was the perfect sized meal. My favorite dish was the risotto with red wine and burrata--it hit all of my comfort food markers for being soft and creamy and savory, and a little tangy. I also loved the chicken livers, and the doughiness of the focaccia. Was anything the best I've ever eaten? No, but nothing was remotely disappointing! This is beautiful Italian food--sometimes very subtle or simple, but always very pleasing.  A note on the cocktails and wine list--the cocktails are strong and the pours are very generous. Don't let the price tag turn you away.  I definitely want to go back, and maybe next time I'll remember to take a picture. But I don't think I'll lose the image of the fountains, and my mom's overjoyed face as a complimentary birthday dessert arrived, anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'd been hearing all kinds of positive buzz about Lago, since it had only opened to the public a week or two before my arrival in Vegas.  I assumed that scoring a reservation would be damn near impossible -- especially since my visit coincided with Vegas Uncork'd -- and no seats appeared to be available on OpenTable.  However, the Bellagio concierge took pity and managed to save me a seat at the bar.  Score!  I was totally thrilled to get this reservation, because Lago is simply marvelous.  It's the latest concept from Julian Serrano, featuring Italian small plates.  Located right on Lake Bellagio (where Circo used to be), the space is bright and inviting, with lots of whites and cool blues and intricate glass tilework.  The fountain show wasn't running the night I dropped by, due to inclement weather, but that didn't seem to bother anyone.  The vibe inside was just electric.  After being seated, I was greeted by Will, who's probably the friendliest and most courteous bartender I've met on the Strip.  He wasted no time getting a cocktail in front of me.  I opted for the Sicilian \"gin and tonic\" with a crispy orange chip and blood orange spheres.  This cocktail was simply gorgeous, and packed a serious kick.  Lago definitely puts a lot of thought into its cocktail program.  Since the menu was done in the style of small plates, I decided to try an array of different items.  Five plates seemed right for a reasonably hungry person:  1.  Nduja crostini with spicy pork sausage and gorgonzola 2.  Capasanta -- scallop crudo with blood orange and pistachio 3.  Short rib cannelloni with parmesan fonduta and tomato 4.  Quagia saltimbocca -- boneless quail with prosciutto 5.  Ravioli al gamberi -- ravioli with shrimp, mascarpone, and tomato  Picking a favorite from these dishes is damn near impossible, since I adored them all for different reasons.  The nduja had a nice spice, which was a good contrast to the cool and fresh scallop crudo.  The canneloni was probably the most traditional item, but the flavor was amazing.  The quail was rich and decadent without being heavy.  The ravioli pretty much melted in my mouth.  Even after all this delicious food, I knew I couldn't leave without trying one of their mouthwatering desserts.  Will recommended the Giandujotto -- hazelnut ice cream with hazelnut/chocolate cream encased in a chocolate shell, all served with chocolate ribbons.  This dessert was stunning to look at and tasted fabulous as well.  Yeah, it's pretty much an Instagrammer's dream come True.  Something about Lago puts its guest in a great mood, because everyone sitting near me was more chatty and outgoing than usual, and wanted to know every detail about the food I was ordering.  Lago truly feels like a destination restaurant for Vegas food aficionados, and that's reason enough for me to return.",

The only negative I could find for the food is probably just me...I felt the focaccia would have been better if there was salt on the focaccia before the ricotta & honey was added-it still tasted great though!

We weren't impressed by much at Lago.   The hostess was confused about when our table might be ready, which pretty much set the tone for our experience. We were seated at an oversized table (two of us) in a really loud restaurant so we had to sit on the same side so we could hear each other. Unfortunately this seating wasn't conducive to a great view of the fountains which mah have been a nice distraction to the busy, disorganized circus environment in the restaurant.  Ok, it had only been open a week so I can kind of forgive the organizational kinks the I'm sure will be ironed out.  We ordered bruschetta (ok but nothing special), langostina (one tiny one for $17), lamb chops (super fatty), filet mignon (just alright), cannelloni with short rib filling (our favorite of the meal but again ultra small) and 7 and 7 a gnocchi and lobster knuckles (pretty tasty), 2 desserts (very good) and a couple drinks each. Bill was about $200 and we were still kind of hungry when we left.  We won't be back to Lago and wouldn't recommend it very highly.",

My boy was delighted by the water show every 15 minutes.  Service, as always was amazing.  They had a pre-fix meal choose two items off the menu and an all you can eat pastries, HEAVEN.  Bananas fosters, crepes, cakes, cookies, sugar heaven.  My main I had the salmon salad.  Wow sliced fresh salmon on a bed of greens.  Delicious.  Then i chose the tenderloin and i could cut it with my fork with hash brown potatoes. To top it off $28 all you can drink bloody mary or mimosa.  What a deal for everything.

After getting our patio table outside, we waited over 35 minutes with no attention and no service with empty drinks. Finally walked out and nobody tried to stop us.

The food was tasty, but not more than elsewhere. We were disappointed by the appetizers: the only standout was the cheese plate that had unusual items. The heirloom tomatoes were not, and it was awkward to have 3 slices for 4 guests. The carpaccio was tasty, but can get that at a good deli. Funghi trifolati was perhaps the most original of the 4 appetizers.   Did not appreciate the suggestion of 2-4 appetizers per person, before what is referred to as the main dishes. Also 2- 4 per person. really? There is Strip pricing and then ripoff.  For the main dishes, the Margherita pizette at 14 $ was overpriced. The short ribs were very very good: at least there were 4 pieces, about 1.5 inches square, for each guest. The branzino was fine, at three pieces. The ravioli al gamberi were fine. Wines by the glass are overpriced.  So overall, it was fair. It was very noisy but expected on a Saturday night. They have very large tables for groups and little acoustic dampening so....Service was attentive.",

I had the scallops appetizer... tasty with a nice presentation but were not properly cleaned as they were gritty.  Also had the Ahi tuna, also a nice presentation but the tuna was tough and not of high quality.  For my entree I had the clams in spicy white wine sauce... it was excellent. Good food starts with quality ingredients and proper preparation and unfortunately they missed it that evening.",

Far and about the best I have ever had.  The view is outstanding watching the Bellagio's fountain show. The service was perfect, everything was coursed out properly, we didn't feel rushed at all. We were 12 people on a Saturday night.  So much fun, I wish I remembered the name of everything we had but it was all amazing! Crab and Gnocci, Gorgoeus ravioli, lamb chops... It kept coming and it was all delicious.  If you can get there it is truly a treat! And if you are lucky enough to get Eemer the pixie like feisty little blonde with an Irish accent to help you out, you'll be in excellent hands.  Wish we could eat there ever night!",

    "text": "An interesting evening to say the least!  My reservation was for 6:15 and I was seated quickly at a small, inappropriate placed, highly dysfunctional table.  The saving grace was that I could watch the fountains at the Bellagio during my meal.  My waiter was attentive and I was served my salad fairly quickly, however, it went downhill from there.  As my main entree I ordered the Risotto with rhubarb and cooked prosciutto.  It was an interesting choice, one that didn't turn me off as I kept eating, but one that left me not knowing what I thought of it.  During my meal, it was over an hour before anyone stopped and asked me how I was doing.  I flagged my waiter to ask for the dessert menu, another 15 minutes before asking what I'd like, another 15 before it came, which wasn't worth the wait.  I could have gone home and made it myself, and it would have been a lot better.  The Tiramisu was DIGUSTING!!!  When you're with a group, I understand you can spend a couple of hours enjoying a meal but dining with just one other person, it shouldn't take 2 hours and 15 minutes for one person. I read some of the other reviews and I most certainly don't agree with them.  This is one restaurant I won't be revisiting!",

We were seated by the great hostesses and had a nice corner booth over looking the Bellagio Fountains. As locals and for girls night, we always try and find a restaurant we haven't been to. Lago is beautiful and staff was friendly. The food was amazing, it's tapas style so ordering three dishes each to share was enough for us. We had Caesar salads to start along with the ricotta and honey toast! Amazing. We liked the 7x7 dish so much we ordered a total of three for 4 girls! The lasagna was so good and the ravioli with shrimp, yum! The lamb was cooked perfectly and took the longest to come out but worth the wait. We ordered every dessert there and none of them failed to disappoint. My only suggestion, was service. Though the staff was friendly, we had to ask for water multiple times. Other than that everything was great!",

Service was great from start to finish. I insisted on holding out for a patio table even though it meant a long wait past our reservation time. We had drinks at the bar meanwhile, which were excellent. When we finally got a table, we had a perfect time watching the fountains. We ordered 6 small plates for 2 people and were stuffed by the end. Standouts for me were the 7&7 (gnocchi with lobster) and the brasato d'anatra (braised duck). For dessert, we mentioned my birthday and were brought a tasty and beautiful dessert for free. I also ordered an espresso, which the waiter went way out of his way to make for me - Lago's machine broke, so he went to an adjoining restaurant to make one and didn't charge us for it. On the way out, every single staff member we saw stopped to thank us for coming in. I'm sure this isn't the best restaurant in Las Vegas, but for our purposes it was the perfect mix that made for a fantastic night. Thank you!",

My wife and I went there for their Thanksgiving dinner special ($33)and had no idea that the dish that they served was a 1oz piece of turkey some Italian sausage that tasted and looked like it came out of a can of spam & three pieces of ravioli with some sauce. We imagined it to be a Thanksgiving dinner with at least two juicy slices of turkey, cranberry sauce and some stove top stuffing. I deeply do regret going there for their so called shitty dinner, my wife and I were so displeased and to make it even worse it was our anniversary that we were also celebrating. I have buyers remorse and wish I had not gone there at all especially when $40 of my money was spent. (Yes it's $40 but it would have been better if I just burnt that money because it was a pure disgrace and waste of money that I went there). You guys should NOT have advertised a Thanksgiving dinner when the food that was served was barely enough to satisfy a two year old. I'm extremely displeased and will be sure to tell everyone I know to never go Lago for any of their (holiday specials). You guys suck! We ended up eating Thai food an hour after and was fully satisfied all while spending much less.",

The bar staff and wait staff are more than friendly and accomodating. The website has \"casual\" listed for dress code. My husband wears consistently the same style clothing-button down shirt, knee length shorts and leather flip flop type shoes. As mentioned before, we have been to the restaurant many times, this time we were accosted at the hostess stand about my husband's foot wear being unacceptable! In addition to this we had a 6:15pm reservation and on arrival (as directed by website) requested patio seating, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. Seatings are limited to 2 hours so.......if dinner begins at 5pm.....7pm would be second seating. I questioned the time estimate and was told a large party was expected and blah, blah.......I was upset but said we would wait and see how the \"large party\" shook out . Again, my husband's shoes were criticized in front of our guests. We went to the bar and miraculously a table on the patio became available within 30 minutes at which time my husband's footwear was again critiqued by the manager!!!!! Walking to the patio we noticed several patrons had on classic flip flops or tennis shoes!!! Not sure of the arbitrary definition of acceptable footwear. I had asked the manager the definition but he was unable to express any.  We will not be returning!!!!",

Initially concerned that this would knock the romance factor down, I needn't have worried. The seating gave us a great view of the restaurant and the Bellagio fountains. Our server, Lorenzo, was extremely attentive, as was the rest of the staff. The tapas-sized portions were just right, allowing us to eat without feeling stuffed. We very much enjoyed the red wine risotto, spaghetti with clams and fresh fresh tomatoes, asparagus spears, and the cheese plate. The caprese was a bit light on the balsamic for my taste, but was nevertheless flavorful. Chef Serrano came out to say hello and was very gracious. We'll be back!",

Then they finally sat us at a table without a view which had been empty the whole time we were waiting. I would certainly understand if they were busy but no one was in a rush. Staff were seen standing around. The manager himself drinking wine at the bar. The service was slow. I had to ask several times just for water. The waiter was slow. No one seemed to be trying very hard since we were a big group. They know they automatically get their 18% even though they did not work for it. I expected much better. Overpriced just as everything is on the strip especially the bellagio. Should have known better",

In reality, it was 10 minutes.   We sat at the bar and the bartender made beautiful, tasty drinks. We were ushered to our seats that were basically located inside of the Bellagio fountains -- we were that close to the water show.   Every dish we ordered was perfection.

    "text": "This review is for 3.5 stars.  I came for a nice business lunch hearing about the prix fixe meal available during the weekdays.  The menu cost $28 and included an appetizer (seafood salad, minestrone, mixed plate, or caprese salad), an entree (lasagna, branzino, pizza) and then a dessert (chocolate, gelato, lemon cake).  We went with the caprese salad and lasagna for one person and the minestrone and branzino for the other.  We then shared a lemon cake and got coffees as we weren't feeling dessert at that point.  There all also options to supplement the meal with either bigger portions r better dishes, but we opted for the basic.  Overall the minestrone came with tons of veggies and the branzino was well cooked.  I was full at the end, especially with the complimentary white bread.  The lasagna was a very interesting, thinly layered variety that was quite tasty while the caprese was just your typical of that dish.  The lemon bar was very nicely crafted and exceptionally tasting.  My biggest complaint was the waitstaff.  They firstly upsold us with garlic bread when we already had regular bread.  We assumed it came complimentary but we saw otherwise when we received the check.  Second issue was the supplement pricing.  The branzino and the pollo dish we were both interested in were $29 on the lunch entree menu but the pollo dish cost an extra $8 on the lunch prix fixe.  This seemed a little weird and the waiter didn't really have an explanation when we reacted to the pricing discrepancy.  Finally, the waiter very poorly gave us alternative options when it came to dairy constraints.  I prefer not to have dairy and the only dessert offered was gelato (non-dairy?  Really?), which I don't eat, that met this criteria.  The only substitute was coffee.  I'd rather have another appetizer or price change to the menu, but I guess that's not how it works.  After a full meal it ran us about $65.  There are definitely better priced options on the strip even for lunch but with a romantic view of the fountains and quality food for the most part, Lago is a suitable option.  For a romantic or business occasion that is easy to appeal to people with all tastes, Lago is great (if you can afford it).  For a typical Vegas lunch when staying on the strip, I would go elsewhere and save your money or a nice dinner.",

We asked if we could move to an empty table that at least had a nice view of the fountains and where also denied that because it had a \"hold\", no one ever sat there...  Also the food is NOT impressive and portions are super small. Plus all the menu is shareable except a couple of entrees. Shareable meaning only- 2 canellonis or 2 bruschetta. Anyways, rant over we wont be returning... so much for an anniversary dinner",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that after a long week here for work I was looking forward to enjoying a great meal as I have heard such wonderful things about the food at this restaurant. I unfortunately have to give at least one star otherwise I cannot post my comments. Although the real rating is zero stars.   The tables are too close to each other where the staff keeps on banging Into the backs of everyone's chair including many members of our party. In addition, you have busy boys without common sense moving large trays of dirty dishes and glasses when their co-workers are in the aisle. When someone in our party asked for salt and pepper, the person brought over a grinder and proceeded to explain 'S' is for salt and 'P' for pepper. I mean how condescending is that?   The food overall was good but the environment leaves much to be desired. The worst part is that we overheard one employee say to another \"Oh they want dessert so they're not leaving soon\". This was after only being here an hour after our reservation.   The server was nice enough but the managers/maitre d are just walking around oblivious to the chaos that is being created. They are the ones who are supposed to manage what's going on and maintaining some sort of order.   Maybe the majority of the diners are oblivious to the lack of care to detail, but with the reputation Julian Serrano has he should be ashamed of this restaurant.   It's a shame. I plan to tell everyone about this horrible experience so that I can save them the hassle and suggest other restaurants where their experience will be better.",

Since it is located in the Bellagio hotel, it is set to overlook the water show with a great view of the Paris Eiffel Tower. The pesto was fantastic! The Caprese appetizer is also tasty but a little too much Basil for this dish. The portions are small but shareable and the wine selection is only semi-diverse. The waiters have good knowledge on wine/drink pairings if you are overwhelmed by the drinks menu. Overall it was a nice experience with a stunning view!",

We got various small platters and shared. We asked the server his favorites and got everything from pastas to fish to salads. They also recommended a bottle of wine which we shared.   The bill came out to around $250 (with alcohol!) which is great for 7 people!   You can see the Bellagio fountain show from this restaurant which is absolutely gorgeous. It makes for a romantic ambience. It's a nice restaurant and people tended to dress classy.   We will definitely be coming back for future Vegas trips!",

We made a reservation for 630 expecting to wait an hour (party of 4) to sit on the patio. Luckily, even on a Saturday night we were able to get seated in maybe 20 minutes? The lights dim when the fountain show is going which makes everything more dramatic and awesome. Definitely worth the wait, and would come back to this spot for special occasions or for some good pictures / a memorable meal.",

    "text": "EPIC 40th birthday weekend 4/6-8/2018 for my cousin in sin city Las Vegas  Lago has a great atmosphere and is situated inside The Bellagio right in front of the amazing fountains.  I had been online to see reviews so I was a bit skeptical but let me assure you all the food was good.  The salad- omg that dressing- superb and those heirloom tomatoes were delicious. No fake food here. The mozzarella cheese was so creamy, thank goodness I paced myself because even though the food was served tapas style- family style there was more than enough for 12 ladies.  The Branzino was perfect - crispy on the one aside as it should be and delicate on the other- the chefs know their business. Beef tenderloin- my mouth almost died and went to heaven- every course tasted better than the one before it seemed. The veggies were fresh and flavorful with a nice crunch- nothing overcooked. The seafood risotto- fresh and delish no mushy anything there was enough seafood in this and a creamy deliciousness like no other. Zero fillers!  The salmon was crusted with pistachio and I wasn't sure about that combination but once again a bite size of flavor - I wanted to eat more.... The chicken- not pictured was on the table of doubt but someone said to try it- I had a forkful and then ended up eating almost the entire little cutlet. Chicken was so moist and flavorful I am so glad I tried it and the sauce, I could easily have licked my finger it was that good.  Now the desserts were cute little bundles of heaven. The lemon one was my favorite, followed by the black forest or ganache with cherries that were laden with some magnificent liqueur. The coffee one went perfect with my espresso after dinner. If I ever go back to Las Vegas, this will be a definite must for me.  We did get to see the fountains - only at the end because that meal nearly stole the entire show.",

They were even very nice about making special items for one person who has to be gluten free.  We had about 12 people and they did make us all wait until everyone was there before they would seat us.  I hate when restaurants do that.  But luckily we did not wait too long.  The bartender took care of us for a few minutes while we waited.  She was wonderful and gave us some good wine options to try.  Here are a few of the things we had. There is definitely other stuff.  BRUSCHETTA AL POMODORO - tomatoes | basil | garlic oil  MARGHERITA - tomato sauce | house made mozzarella | basil CHEESE PLATTER - briaco del Piave | quadrello di bufala | pecorino | Parmigiano | carta musica bread SALUMI -- COLD CUTS PLATTER - prosciutto di Parma  finocchiona salame  rosemary porchetta | carta musica bread  FUSILLIORO - corkscrew pasta: Abruzzo | lamb ragu | spuma di ricotta SALMONE - pistachio crusted salmon | oven dried tomatoes | rapini | red wine sauce FILETTINO - 4oz Angus beef tenderloin | gorgonzola  We also had a variety of desserts.

    "text": "Lago is a chic restaurant space with modern decor and some excellent view seating but the wait time and overall arrogant service were disappointing, which explains my one star review.   I called ahead and made a reservation 24 hours in advance for a birthday celebration dinner. Based on open table, they had plenty of reservation times available during peak and off peak dinner hours for Friday night. It is also advertised on open table that this is a restaurant good for large groups and celebrations.   When I called the concierge to book my appointment, he asked many questions such as any specific dietary restrictions, are we celebrating anything, would we like a seat with a view of the fountain, etc. I mentioned yes, we have one vegetarian, we are celebrating a birthday, and yes we would love a view of the fountain. The concierge stated there are vegetarian options, he would note that we are celebrating a birthday, and that we should arrive 15minutes before our reservation time so we can get a seat with a view of the fountain. Making the reservation was painless and based on all the Q and A, I felt like Lago would be an enjoyable experience.  Our entire party arrived at the restaurant at 8:45pm for our 9pm reservation. I actually had to wait at the maitre d stand as there were several groups in front of us so by the time we checked in, it was 8:55pm. I believe the owner was the host that night, based on yelp pictures of restaurant owner. He was not welcoming at all, he and the women staff around him did not smile or acknowledge us with a greeting. It was the most uncomfortable and standoffish restaurant check in I've ever experienced.   The host/owner mentioned we could be seated immediately or wait 20minutes for a seat with a view. We agreed to wait for the view seating since that would be part of the dining experience at Lago. He said ok you're checked in, but did not give any information as to how we would be contacted. I had to ask how will we know when our table is ready? He mentioned that he would let me know, that I should stay around the area. Most restaurants with this kind of traffic and updated technology give you a beeper or text you when your table is ready. That might be something this restaurant can take into consideration since it is a popular foodie destination.  There was no waiting area so I sat at a slot machine chair directly in front of the maitre d stand in candid view of the host. By 9:15pm, my friends were restless and annoyed that we were waiting for a table even with an advanced reservation. I approached the maitre d stand and the host/owner with a very nonchalant demeanor stated, oh your table is ready, is your entire party here? Wow!! I had been sitting directly in front of the maitre d stand for 15minutes and he never bothered to inform me that our table it ready. We were led to a table with a great view of the lago and fountain show, but it was probably not even our table as it was set up for a party of 9. Another party must have been tired of waiting and left before getting seated.  The food is hit or miss, some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty and executed well but the bistecca was tough and chewy, not a good quality piece of meat for a high end restaurant. We also ordered the lobster gnocchi based on all the positive reviews but it didn't impress.   Consistent with the service from the host/owner, our server was aloof and unwelcoming. For the birthday celebration, they put a candle in a dessert that we ordered off the menu and had to pay for. The execution of the dessert presentation was untimely and unorganized, they didn't even ask who's birthday it is and brought out the lit dessert and placed it in front of my friend who ordered it, not the birthday person who actually went to the restroom at the time.   If you're willing to overlook the awful service, wait time, and hit or miss food, you may enjoy the view and decor of this restaurant. For us, it was consistently disappointing and we will never dine here again, even with our free M life rewards.",

    "text": "Julian Serrano does it again this time with a trendy Italian dining hotspot.    Set in a stunning modern Italian dining space with views of the fountains of Bellagio, Lago delivers a great social dining experience centered around sharing plates and evoking conversation.   Tip:  On menu small plate portions are sensible and designed for two to three.  Ask the servers as many items can be ordered individually to adjust for the number at the table.  Hold a menu and order in flights.  Dishes will always be served at the right temperature and there is no chance of overdoing it.    In general, the food is simple, emphasizing a single element and supporting it with the addition of ingredients.  This is six sense dining with many dishes emphasizing umame.  SUCKLING PIG!  Order it when you first make your reservation or hope to get very lucky.  This off the menu item is a Serrano specialty.  Whole (about 8 pounds, half, or a quarter), golden brown, uber crisp skin surrounds sweet, fall off the bone tender, juicy, porky goodness.  Rosemary perfumes the air and tints every bite.  A singlular experience so good it can bring tears to your eyes.  The polpo e fregola al nero (tender grilled octopus legs with squid ink imbued Sardinian couscous and shaved botarga) is stunning.  Herbaceous basil, zesty lemon and peppery olive oil elevate the dish providing welcome brightness while the botarga, umame complexity.  The squid ink cous cous adds a creamy, oceanic finish to the dish that works exceptionally well when paired with the octopus.  7&7 (gnochi with lobster claw in a tomato based sauce reminiscent of a lobster bisque.  Gnochi is fluffy on the inside and pan seared crispness on the outside for great textural foil for the sweet, tender lobster knuckles.  Not to be missed, the quail Saltimbocca (boneless braised sage flavored quail wrapped in prosciutto served in its own jus).  Oh so tender, just the right of salinity, the prosciutto heightens the gaminess of the quail perfectly.  Screams autumn.  The risotto alla trippa e funghi (risotto of tripe, mushrooms, and mint).  A loose tomato based risotto hitting on all levels.  Mushrooms heighten the umame overtones when combined with the tripe's funkiness while the acidic tomato sauce provides balance.  Creamy, warm, and delicious  Finally, the vitello tonnato (chilled thinly sliced, par cooked veal loin with a tuna, caper dressing) is just good eats.  Keep thinking People Eating Tasty Animals and you're OK.  Mildly beefy, texture so soft almost like sweetbreads.  It's flavors becoming more pronounced thanks to the briny, salty capers.  Ahhhh.    Service is outstanding however could do without the Italian fashion world attitude (Italian dining should be jovial, not standoffish).  Very impressive signature cocktail list.  Definitely try one before dinner.  Creative, sophisticated and yummy!  Very good, wine list.  Look to non typical regions for the best value and most intriguing selections (Aged German pinot noir, Spanish grand reserva Rijoa).  Vegas resort pricing.  Yet another home run.  Well worth the visit.",

    "text": "Read through a few reviews while looking for a nice place for a dinner date. Had more than a few chuckles at what people gave Lago bad reviews for.   The 7&7 is an absolute delight of a dish. The potato gnocchi might as well have came from an Italian grandmother's own kitchen. The lobster was some of the best I've had, and with them all being knuckles, extremely consistent bites. The Spaghetti di fruti di mare is also another perfect option. People are complaining about price and size, yet you are getting lobster, scallop, shrimp, and clams, along with solid pasta, in one dish?  1. There is food on the menu that is there because it has to be. When you have a party of 15 and have a bodybuilder who insists that he only eat chicken and vegetables. Or for the loyal husband whose seafood-loving wife picked the place, but he only eats steak and burgers. They probably only have small pizzas on the menu because they're an Italian place. Get steak at a steakhouse. Get pizza at a pizza joint. Get seafood and pasta at Lago. Its not hard  2. Of course the wine is more expensive than your local grocery store. Sure, almost all restaurants will be somewhat overpriced for a glass, but here you get a sommelier you can call over at any time to help pair a wine with a dish, and being tapas style, there are many pairings.   3. If you want to sit by the window like I did for the fountain, you have two logical options. Reserve for 5pm, and you'll be seated by the window because obviously, you'll be the first to be seated. Or, wait, because there are people who have to finish eating for you to take their seat. I don't see how you not sitting by the window means the restaurant sucks.",

The wait staff were for the most part very good, food came out as it was ready. Loved the tapas and cocktails. Our favs were: the clams and spaghetti, the meatballs, bruschetta (and I rarely like any raw tomatoes) and the gnocchi. All excellent. The mussels and the artichoke crab dish, not so much.   The waiter was a little slow with the refills on the wine and water, but given that we were so close to the bellagio fountains and the dishes we liked were so yummy, it's still 5 stars! I would highly recommend (it's pricey, but what the hell, it's vegas!) and I plan to return.",

Tasted like any other average restaurant that serves shrimp. Gnocchi- it was hand molded or by a device but the oil was not hot enough and you could see the color- server said it was braised?

Standouts were the pesto pasta (the pesto was clearly homemade) and shrimp stuffed squid (which I had never seen before - SO GOOD!!!).  Our server recommended 3 - 4 plates per person.  We did not follow this guideline, as this would have been very expensive.  Instead, my boyfriend and I split a bruschetta and then split four more \"main\" small plates - essentially 2.5 per person.  This was more than enough for two normal sized humans.  We were plenty full.  The atmosphere was also great.  We were seated right by the window for a view of the fountains.    My one main complaint (knocking a star) is that the wine prices were outrageous.  The cheapest glass on the menu was $16, for a wine I have never heard of.  The good wines were $19, or $90 for a bottle.  In my opinion, this is out of control.  We just drank Goose IPA for $9 (still slightly overpriced, but it's Vegas).",

The cocktails are unique and strong so I would recommend trying ones that are aligned with the liquor you are accustomed too because they are strong. I note there is nothing wrong with strong drinks and personally prefer them that way.

Since we're all at different phases in my life and I'm a social butterfly I figured a Sunday morning brunch would be suitable for us all to celebrate. Initially we were going to be seated on their beautiful balcony however it began to rain. We still had a killer view inside. I mean, justlcome here for the view. I decided on this spot for the view. The cherry on top was the water show front row seating we had every 15 minutes. We had a family style pastry basket brought to our table upon being seated. Everyone at the table raved about the various pastries they had. Now for the best part, the restaurant had customized the menus to read HAPPY 25th BIRTHDAY SHAHIRA!!! A menu at another table had the same header! How thoughtful is that and the hospitality is mind blowing. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE AT LAGO!  We each were able to select our own course 1 & 2. I got the the Shredded Salmon Salad and the Filettino. Both were very delicious! The dessert bar was self serve and they had: a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, Rice Krispies. They had tiramisu, Nutella Crepe, Panettone Pudding & Fruit Salad (my favorite; so fresh).  In addition, the service was great! They serve bottomless Sunday drinks for an additional $28.00 and they have a wide range of options from mimosas to bellinis to bloody Mary's with full range of juices. The gourmet food decor was nothing short of excellent!   I can't wait to return at a later date for dinner!!!",
