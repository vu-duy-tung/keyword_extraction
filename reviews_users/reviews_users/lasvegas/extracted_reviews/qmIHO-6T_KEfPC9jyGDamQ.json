The first indication that the food would not be up to par is when they serve steak with 5 different sauces. I True filet does not need any condiments. They then served us COLD fries, we sent them back to be reserved, still luke warm. We also ordered the sauteed mushrooms (which are my favorite) and they were chunky pieces of rubber! I don't know how you mess up mushrooms but they managed to do it. To sum it up the food is not a five star experience. We dropped $200 on dinner were I would have been happier with McDonalds.   With that said...yes the food was terrible but I must admit the service was impeccable! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about food and wines, polite, and accommodating.",

So coming into the restaurant, I wasn't as jovial as I could have been. But my dining experience at Jean George completely transformed my moods. Upon entering the restaurant, the first thing you notice is the ambiance. The interior design is unparalleled. It's so cozy and comfortable.  Michael and Ramon were our waiters and we couldn't have asked for better service. They were friendly, knowledgeable, understanding, and extremely helpful with my broken hand. It was very difficult for me to cut my steak and Ramon literally cut the steak for me! The food was insanely good. We got filet mignon, calamari, black truffle Mac and cheese, wavy beef carpaccio with truffles, and for dessert we got the black souffle cake and apple pie. All of the food was the best I've ever had. Hands down. If you're ever in Vegas, do yourself a favor and go to JG! And ask for Ramon and Michael: best waiters we've ever had.",

My steak was undercooked, but still deliciously tender and flavorful. We ordered additional sides that did not disappoint...mashed potatoes, bone marrow, asparagus with mushrooms, and carpaccio. The servers were very accommodating and pleasant to our large and demanding group. The restaurant is dark and has great ambiance for an intimate dining experience. The cuisine is great, although very exorbitantly priced, but the good service and delicious food and good company (family) made it a worthwhile experience.",

Course 1: Caviar in an Israeli lemon peel with creme fraiche, paired with Varnier-Fanniere Grand Cru, Cote des Blanc Champagne. Course 2: Tuna tartare with avocado and radish, a sesame dressing and a rice cracker, paired with a 2004 Jo Pithon Chenin Blanc. Course 3: Creamy burrata salad with a honey crisp apple, concord grape and pomegranate, herbs, a sesame and sunflower seed cracker with an ice wine vinaigrette, paired with a riesling from Mosel, Germany Course 4: Diver scallop with baby bok choy, trumpet mushroom, micro basil with an aromatic butternut squash reduction poured tableside over it, paired with a Darioush, Voigner, Signature Napa Valley Chardonnay Course 5: 6oz Australian Wagyu beef filet with a soy marinade, japanese radish and a crispy kale chip with a lavender mustard, paired with a 2011 Quintessa Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley. Course 6: Chocolate and peanut butter cup sundae with a concord grape sorbet, topped with whipped cream, paired with a 1989 Kopke Port  My favorite was the Wagyu, it was so melt in your mouth amazing!!!  Everything was absolutely delicious though!  The service was spectacular.  Have you ever had someone explain the food so passionately that it actually made it taste better!?  Yes, it's a real thing!  I want to come back here like tonight, but I'll have to wait till my next trip!",

One thing to keep in mind, if you've ever been tempted to take up a restaurant staff's offer of taking a picture of you and your date over dinner.... don't do it here. It's standard practice to conveniently refrain from quoting a price until after they've already made the prints and put them in a nice folder, but brace yourself for JG. 70 bucks?

Service was mediocre and nothing close to what a 3 Michelin Star establ. Should have. Sommelier was rude. One of us had the $360 cut of Kobe and it was ordered Medium, came out medium well. Kidding right? I ordered the filet, came out medium well, ordered medium. Sent it back three times and they couldn't get it right. Again your kidding right? For these prices and reputation it's hard to fathom.Manger took off that steak but wouldn't take off the Kobe one because we didn't complain enough about it?! Omg. The sides were tasteless and way too much black truffle in the Mac and cheese. Just overall a very bad experience. Don't waste your time or money. Just go to SW. it never disappoints and they cook a steak correctly. Including an amazing Kobe cut.  Will never be back.",

The only two good items on the menu was the steak, which literally melted in my mouth, and the dessert, which was served at its most perfect state.   Wine: The waiters were very helpful in picking out a nice wine for the table. When in doubt, just ask the waiter on job recommendation of a nice pairing for the wine.  Ambiance: The restaurant is really quiet and a great place for an executive dinner or date. There is also a bar in the front of the restaurant and the decor is beautiful. The bar is also a good place to watch a game while enjoying a cup of beer.  Price:  Given that it is a hotel restaurant by a 3 star Michelin chef, it's not expensive. Given that it is after all a steak house, I'm not disappointed with the quality of the steak. I would probably only go back if I was craving a real quality steak. But for everything else on the menu, you can probably eat similar food at a different, cheaper restaurant.",

My favorite is Jean George. Very cool interior with the black, red and gold, bathrooms are the best in LV. Vibe is totally vegas and great energy. Place is always rocking in-spite having of one of the most un-desirable locations inside of a major casino. Second floor? Who designs these floor plans.   The bar is circular with some great HD screen sports action, very few places serves this high quality of food with the game on. I had event in the private dinning room, it was very nice and we had great privacy and service. The shell fish platters were a hit. I like to order some of the off-menu items like the Tomahawk Steak, Chateaubriand and Asian Ginger Lobster. The jalapeno garlic  mushroom are Jean George V at his best. Mix the hot sauce and soy miso better sauce, its awesome.  Reggie does a great job with the wine as the som and will find some hidden gems. Mike and Darren are great at service at the bar with cocktails/menu and Gary also knows his wine and the menu cold. Overall highly recommended and worth a visit no matter where you are staying in Vegas.",

We still had our menus in our hands when the appetizers arrived -- although our drinks and bread still hadn't. The restaurant manager is INCOMPETENT (to say the least) and has no business running a high-end establishment.

Save yourself the aggravation and pick one of the several hundred other steakhouses in Vegas.",

    "text": "Jean Georges is by far the best Vegas steak restaurant. Tonight we tried the carpaccio appetizer and the Jean Georges twist made it absolutely delicious...not too-thin sliced beef wrapped around a crispy breaded truffle with a balsamic and truffle mayonnaise sauce...oh, yeah it's almost a meal!  We shared a surf and turf with a deliciously sweet and perfectly textured lobster tail. The fillet was cooked perfectly medium rare and served with four signature sauces. The chef surprised us with a broiled bone marrow served with toast points and lemon gremolata...oh my!  What a presentation won't do to make you feel special! And if the food wasn't enough the ambience was delightful. Service was exceptional-John, our server knows how to keep it moving without feeling rushed. Very friendly but not overly present.  Pano, the manager, was interactive and made his presence known...which we think is such a good sign that the restaurant cares about its customers!   What more could one ask for?",

My complaint is the poorly designed ladies room, there is no place to stash your purse except the floor. Then if you take your purse to the table bathroom bacteria is transferred to the table. How many women have had to put their clutch on the floor then the table? Yuk, I imagine the whole restaurant is contaminated.",

I know Jean George is some big time chef..blah blah...but it doesnt need to be that high.  It is not ridiculous like Robuchons for example, but for the price vs quality, I would rather go to BOA or Flemmings and get the same quality of food for a better price.  Overall great place if money grows on trees.  Cool joint for entertaining.",

    "text": "My family and I went to Jean George for the second time.  We all got there a bit early this time.  They started prepping our table.  My sister, who wasn't planning on coming decided to come with her 4 month old.  We told them we needed 1 more seat.  No problem there.  When they saw my sister walk in with her son, they said they don't allow children under 5.  Not 10 seconds after she says that, as my brother is talking to hostess, a family walks out with 3 kids.  The oldest couldn't have been 6 yet, and the youngest was still an infant.  I walked to the host station and showed her my platinum mLife card and she went and talked to the manager.  He came over, shook my hand, and offered a bottle of wine on the house, and obviously allowed my nephew to join us.  My nephew didn't make a peep all through dinner.   Onto the dining experience.   We were seated at one of the large round booths.  Very comfortable and was easy to see and hear everyone.  We got some form of enormous seafood platter as an appetizer for the table.  Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, oysters, clams, and prawns.  Everything was delicious!  They server told us about the specials.  One was a Kobe filet for $210.  Wow.  There was a half Kobe half Wagyu bone in rib-eye that they aptly dubbed \"The Tomahawk.\"  Check the pictures, I will upload one.  This thing was big and tasty.  It came with a green sauce on the side that was good, but I prefer my steaks with no sauce.  The server picked out a good bottle of wine, for free remember!  It went great with the steak.   For dessert, my girlfriend and I shared a Creme Brulee.  I have yet to have a bad Creme Brulee.... Will be going back for sure, but I did take off a star due to how the treated my sister.",

    "text": "Wonderful service. Wonderful food.  Really, what more can one ask for at a steakhouse?  In a city with tons of choices, we were a bit skeptical when we visited this fairly new restaurant at Aria.  The smell of Aria is so annoying (what is that, Vanilla?) that we had to suffer through it all just to get to the restaurant.  But once inside, it's like a dark club.  The music is too loud, for sure.  But the food makes up for it.  The only reason we don't give it five stars is because a steakhouse should have a REAL Caesar Salad.  That means big chunks of Romaine, real anchovies, large slices of Parmesan, and real housemade croutons.  Here, the Caesar salad has none of these things.  The steak is seriously yummy.  We will return JUST FOR THE STEAK.  (What is it with the new trend of sending out sauces with steak?  Carnevino and CUT do this too.  We believe a great steak stands on its own, with salt and perhaps a little pepper only.  Please don't send out my seventy dollar piece of meat with balsamic something or another glaze.  And keep the soy whateveritscalled in the kitchen.  We want steak.  That's it.)",

Steaks are wonderful normally comes with 3 sauces, from their homemade sauce, classic Bearnaise sauce and a jalapeno and cream sauce. Their side dishes are great and their wine selection is very extensive. New restaurant so decoration is very trendy, service is immaculate, noise level acceptable for a busy restaurant at a Party town. Overall we had excellent time. I recommend for intimate dinner or a big party. I can't wait to visit again.",

    "text": "Went on a getaway to Vegas with two other married couples (sans kids for all) and decided to eat at Jean George since we were staying at Aria.  Now let me say that the food was really really awesomely good.  All 6 of us loved the appetizers, entrees and sides.  The service left something to be desired.  Our waiter and sommelier were great but the lag time between appetizers and entrees was over an HOUR.  The excuse we were given was that there was a wedding party that were served in front of us.  That is not an excuse for the kitchen to be slow in my opinion.  You are a high end restaurant, charging high end prices and we had a reservation.  You can't cook for two parties at once?  So after complaining to the manager, they were very nice and comped our bottle of wine and all cocktails consumed.  Which, my friends, was a pretty penny.  Now on to the delicious deets.  Appetizers-Crab cake and bacon wrapped shrimp.  One of the girls said this was the best crab cake EVER and practically licked the bowl.  I thought it was really good.  It's definitely not your typical crab cake.  The cake was all crab and it had a gingery broth underneath.  Very Nice.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was \"da bomb\" according to the men and it was very well cooked.  The bacon was crisp and shrimp not overdone.   Two in our party got the cobb salad and said it was excellent as well.  Entrees-Two of us had the rib-eye, which was super good and fatty.  My husband got the filet, which came out overcooked, but the new one was out within 3 minutes.  One got the veal, one got the sea bass (not a beef eater), and one got the special NY strip.  Each steak came with a chimichurri sauce, but they also served 4 sauces on the side with the entrees and the habanero sauce was super spicy but so goooood.  The sides we ordered were asparagus, sauted mushrooms and artichokes, creamed corn and mashed potatoes.  Everything was cooked perfectly and yummy yummy.    No time for desert!  :(  We were already late due to the slow service.  Definitely someplace I'd eat again.",

We arrived at the restaurant and the girl at the front didn't seem very happy at all, just said \"hi\". We were never asked about our \"celebration\". We saw our waiter twice. After someone else brought us our food we were never asked how it was or anything. We had to get someone else to get our check. The guy who poured our water poured it all over the table and didn't clean it up. This sounds really rude but we are never ones to complain (honestly 2nd Yelp review I've ever written the first was positive). But when you spend $170 on a two person dinner you expect high quality service and that was the farthest thing from it. Won't be going back here again ever.",

To start off the meal, they had the standard bread basket with several different varieties of bread. Their butternut squash soup was super yummy and their caesar salad is to die for. & Moving onto the main course....we had the grilled wagyu filet mignon and the NY strip. both were good but i'm not much of a steak fan so the sides we ordered were 100000x better. the broiled bone marrow ( sounds unappetizing, i know ) was amazing! along with their roasted brussel sprouts. We also got the creamed spinach, but I like the one at Lawry's better. =/   We didn't try any of their desserts since Jean Phillipe's patisserie was right downstairs and i was dying to try their deserts....  The service was great, and the waiters were incredibly friendly and the atmosphere wasn't as stuffy as you'd imagine. OH and their pineapple mojitos. I noticed that their wine collection was pretty extensive, but the prices seemed to be a little higher than other places on the strip....which is understandable, it is Aria after all.  The overall ambiance was pretty mellow, the music seemed quite loud for an upscale restaurant but it seemed like a great date night place! :P  But all in all, it was just one of those places that I'd only visit once simply because there are so many steakhouses in vegas.",

I don't know if it''s me but the whole ambiance feels cheap.  Kind of felt that the portions were smaller than what was advertised.  On a brighter note the side dishes were very good.

We also had foi gras appetizer which by far was the high point of the meal. If you have never tried it and can get over the preparation, get it!!!   Then came the steak...the one thing we were there for. The steak was just ok. Medium rare filet was slightly over cooked but I'm picky. It tasted fine though. The bone in ribeye was light on flavor.   The one thing I found curious was the additional sauces that were served with the steaks. If your steaks stand alone or taste great with the marinade and spices they are cooked in why do you need extra sauce?   I'm glad we went, I can say we would be back maybe only to eat the foi gras, which is a shame because this is a steak place.",

There wasn't a drink flow which would have made the errors tolerable in fact they barely asked me for drink orders I had to grab their attention.  In 2.5 hours I was served 2 glasses of wine.  I ordered a 16oz dry aged new York steak cooked medium that looked overdone on the outside and completely raw on the inside.  It was embarrassing trying to cut through the steak.  The whole table was moving. I seriously could not even cut all the way through the steak.  I waited for the server to check on us for quite awhile and he agreed that the steak didn't even looked cooked.  Finally they replaced it with a filet that I requested (which was the size of 2 golf balls $64) instead of the other style steak and it was cooked right however I wasn't even hungry at that point so I took it to go.  They brought out French fried with the steak and the fries were too salty to eat.  There were a couple disappointments but nothing worse than the steak.  You would think that for an $85 steak (steak only)  it better be the best damn steak you ever had.  It is there specialty right?  Thank goodness I wasn't paying.  Bummer experience overall.",

We ordered the big Tomahawk steak for $285, my friend also got the New York steak and I got the rib eye. We ordered the mushrooms, asparagus, truffle mashed potatoes and spinach for the sides. The sides were shareable but it was separate order from the steaks. The tomahawk took a while to cook. It still came out pretty rare but it was huge and still good. Our server cut it for us along side our table. The bone was huge. It was more than a 42oz steak. They honestly gave us the biggest one. I would have to say the steak here was really delicious and well seasoned you didn't have to add any sauce or anything else to it. It's how a good steak should be. The side dishes were good but nothing special or different. Although the truffle mash potatoes was yummy. Our server was friendly and prompt she was friendly and helped guide us to ordering. She had help from others and they made sure our glasses of water was never empty! Excellent customer service and they are very attentive to your needs. I really liked the bread as well that they gave us. It was so soft in the inside . Delicious bread. Loved it. Didn't have any room for dessert but I definitely would recommend the steaks here. Delicious ! I took the bone home of the tomahawk and put it right next to my dog face and it's bigger than him. Hhahahahaha",

    "text": "I really wanted to write an exceptional review for this steakhouse, but unfortunately cannot. The expectations were high upon entering.  Darker environment typical of a fine steakhouse.  Wonderful selection of wines, great attentive staff.    Started with a nice cold seafood platter appetizer, then a great salad.  Then it was on to pick what should be the star of the show in a steakhouse, a steak.  With selections ranging from grass-fed filet to a Wagyu tomahawk for two or even grade A5 Kobe beef there should be something for everyone.  Turned out that both myself and my friend settled on a dry-aged bone-in New York.  Added a side of asparagus and a starch and we were all set.  Upon arrival the star of the evening looked great.  Appeared well cooked and ready to enjoy.  That's where it went bad.   Upon cutting into the steak it was immediately evident that this wasn't going to be good.  The first (difficult) cuts were into large sections of fiber and fat.  Okay, fine.  Fat adds flavor after all. As I continued I found the steak to be incredibly difficult to cut, let alone chew. There was also a distinct lack of flavor which seemed very odd. My friend decided to not say anything and while I wanted to, I couldn't help myself.  I explained the situation and was told that \"maybe it was the dry-aging process that's different and I simply wasn't used to it.  The process sets out the meat and can make it tougher.\"   Hmm. I responded that I've had many dry aged steaks and the explanation was exactly opposite of what it should do.  The process concentrates flavor and tenderizes the meat.   We reached a point where they decided it was maybe a bad cut...let's try another. Okay.   Round two;  second steak arrives and looks nice as well.  It's a cleaner cut and initial impressions are positive.  Until I start (trying) to cut into it.  I soon reached the same conclusion. Inedible.  I left 90% of an expensive steak on the plate and was done.  :( Could barely cut into the thing let alone chew it.   The gentleman clearing the plates was surprised and wanted to bring a box.  I told the server and she had little to say except for the dry-age explanation which is not right.  Manager came over offering apologies and the same reasoning.  Disappointing for sure.   Now maybe, just maybe I'm wrong about the aging process.  It I have been fortunate to enjoy many dry-aged cuts and this was the worst experience ever.  My friend who decided not to say anything because he is a super nice guy, wishes he would.  It was not just my steak.   And here is a small snippet from one of the many easily available descriptions of dry-aging. \"The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.\"  What a shame.  I only gave it several hundred dollar meal two stars for the staff and the starters.  We should have stayed with our first stop at Herringbones, but the only table available was right next to a large and loud private party.  Oh well.   I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. Many great choices very close by.",

Then when I waited my drinks for 20 mins because it was a handmade cocktail, alright.  How about my water? Why do we need to wait 20 mins for a glass of water?   Food was horrible. Meat was bland. Lack of flavor, Nothing cooked right.  Disappointed.",

The service was excellent.  It was the food that was disappointing.  The bread they serve was very good.  It was a brioche loaf and butter with chives.  I ordered a Casaer salad and it was one of the most mediocre salads I've ever had.  First of all, I paid $18.  It was romaine and dressing.  That's it.  Not only that, but there were two Romaine ends in the salad.  My fiance had a wedge salad, also $18, and it was good but certainly not worth the money.  For entrees, he had the short rib, which was excellent.  I had the sea bass, and the miso-yuzu glaze was almost cloyingly sweet.  I paid $250 for a meal that overall was very mediocre.  I've paid a lot less for a much more amazing experience.",

The sauce  needed a bit more acidity to compliment the heavy app.  Bone in ribeye was overcooked but I don't like sending food back and wasting. The waiter could have given a refill on the wine or such out of courtesy. The truffle mash was pretty on point, probably my favourite part of this dinner.  The Riesling was a bit too cold but the Zinnfandel was just amazing.",

Dim lighting, quiet atmosphere and very elegant, yet nothing over the top. Can be for a romantic dinner for two or even a nice dinner with close family and friends.   Service: Impeccable service!! We were treated like royalty. Unfortunately we were on a bit of a time crunch and the server and chef all helped make our dining experience great while making sure we were out by a certain time. Jean George, you have a great group of staff!  Food: --Oysters: Yum. Fresh. That's all I ask. They're the smaller sized oysters so nothing too messy. Comes with a mignonette, cocktail sauce, lemons, and tabasco. Plenty of options to suite your taste. --Lobster Mash: So happy to hear they had this on their menu at the time of my visit. Very rich lobster flavor, but not much lobster bits...which I prefer having. But it does come in a standard side dish size, which great (I expected a much smaller portion). --Lobster tail: To compliment the lobster they gave us lemon, margarine, and a minty pesto sauce. Surprisingly loved the hint of minty flavor!!  --Bone in rib eye: Cooked to perfection. Very juicy. Loved the 4 sauces Jean George provides to pair with.   Overall, the food was good. A good steakhouse. Good food. Great sauce compliments as recommended. I liked the food but am not dying to come back. However I really did enjoy the service. Round of applause for the staff!!",

    "text": "Disappointing would be my summary.   For the price paid, most of my items ordered were just ... lacking.    Caesar salad - Didn't taste like a fresh made Caesar.  Lettuce seemed a bit weak va crunchy crisp.  Dressing was unremarkable.  To be blunt, their salad was not even as good as Black Angus' and that's sad for a $15 salad.   Calamari - unusual presentation with a little cup of dipping sauce way disproportionate to the amount of calamari received.  I appreciate receiving the sauce.  But the calamari was dare I say ... too strong a \"fishy taste\"?  I mean I've certainly had both frozen and fresh calamari, but this one the texture and taste was just a little off.  Tasted like a box of frozen bait squid was left to thaw, and they managed to fry it into something resembling calamari.  About $18?  I'd give them the eve for of the doubt on this one and just rack it up to chef's style of preparation.    18 oz bone in ribeye.  Steak was pretty good. But they served their house sauce in a cheesy looking plastic bone marrow looking serving container.  Either give real bone marrow as a treat. Or find something classier.   Diver scallops - 4 out of 5.  No complaints.   Creamed spinach - average.  Nothing to write home about Truffles mash potatoes - same comment as above.   If you want to taste something truly like truffles- and have a great steak.  I'd recommend SW steak at the Wynn and get their truffled corn.  Marginally more expensive, but a lot more memorable for the right reasons.",

The bed if avocado plus the grape fruit was a nice combo of acidity and salt and  worked well with texture and taste of the crab.

    "text": "Husband and I originally had reservations for Craft Steak but our concierge convinced us to try Jean George's since we were staying at Aria.   It was very easy to get a reservation. We checked in at 8pm and they were able to secure us a 9:30 reservation on a Saturday evening. We walked in and were greeted by name and immediate shown to our seats. Dimly lit dining area. Intimate ambience. So far so good.   Our waitstaff was super attentive from then on. They recommended excellent choices and our glasses were never empty and they kept asking if we needed anything every 10 min or so.   We ordered the wagyu carpaccio to start, 2 filet mignons medium rare, bone marrow, mushroom side and truffle Mac and cheese. Well, let me just say... I almost cried. Their carpaccio was easily one of the BEST things I've ever eaten. Perfectly rare with a truffle crunch in the middle and truffle shavings on top. I'd order that every day for the rest of my life.   Our main courses arrived soon after. The bone marrow and toast. Ugh. Also amazing. With the success of the earlier two dishes, my mouth was watering as I cut into my filet. The char seemed a little too dark, but I trusted they knew what they were doing. I cut into in knowing already that it wasn't medium rare because of how sturdy the meat was..and it was gray. No pink. I asked my husband if his was the same, but his was perfect. Ahhh killjoy. Now, I had already scooped truffle Mac and mushrooms onto my plate to enjoy together, so I was really hesitant about saying anything, but my husband insisted and motioned for our server. I asked him if it was cooked right and he agreed it looked more medium/ medium well. Another server came by and confirmed. I felt so bad about asking for a new piece but our waiter was completely understanding and said, \"no this should be perfect for you.\" He literally came back with a new steak 5 minutes later and it was everything I expected. Perfectly juicy and perfectly cooked. The manager checked in and apologized and I appreciated it.  Sigh...I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for that meat issue, and would have let it go if it was for a side dish. But they specialize in Steak. And you can only have that first bite once. They made up for it with the complimentary dessert and excellent service and then lost a star again with the pushy photographers who were a little aggressive about a $200 photo package while we were eating dessert. I expected that they would do it on the way out, not table side. That just kind of cheapened the experience and made it feel more cruise ship. But you could tell they were outside vendors because they didn't have the same delicacy and finesse as the restaurant staff.  Overall, I would still highly recommend Jean George's to anyone looking for a great date night with excellent food.",

    "text": "Food is the soul of the restaurant, and this one failed to deliver.   The ingredient was excellent. Certified Kobe beef was delicate and juicy, the dried age steak as good meat flavor, the prime filet was tender, lobster was fresh. However, the preparation failed the ingredient.  Overall, the food was too salty, taking away the flavor of the meat. Kobe and other good cut of beet only need light seasoning to bring out the meat flavor, but instead the salt over powered all other senses. Part of the steak was also unevenly charred.  In addition to steaks, I also ordered the miso Sea Bass. The fish was overcooked, over salted, and edge of one side was charred.   Ironically, the best feature of the night was the Tristan Lobster tail. Normally at a steak establishment, ordering seafood comes with some risk. This \"steak addition\" however became the saving grace of the dinner. I would go as far as recommending skipping the steak altogether, and just get the lobster tail, it was nicely cooked, with excellent flavor and supple mouth feel. The bone marrow was also tasty, with a nice display of the whole 1/2 femur. Service was also excellent, wait staff was very attentive.  If you are looking for a good lobster tail, this is your place to eat. Otherwise if you are looking for a good steak, keep moving on... Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's good.",

Sitting at the bar for dinner is a must, as Darren, Mike, and Gary are some of the best bartenders in Vegas! All the drinks on the menu are delicious, but if you don't see something you like or want to try something new they would be glad to give you a recommendation or make you something special. I know that Darren has won many mixology competitions and is a master mixologist! Overall I highly recommend anyone in Vegas going to eat at Jean Georges steakhouse- it will not disappoint.",

For a $200 dinner i'd rather go to Mastro's or just ask my dad to grill steak for me. I had HIGH expectations for this restaurant. I've had way way way better meal for a reasonable price!   The service was really amazing though. Thank you to our server Doris! she made our night :)",

Maybe Jean Georges intended this restaurant to be of high quality. I will give him the benefit of doubt since I don't even know who he is. But the clowns that work here and especially those responsible for selecting and cooking the cuts of meat need to go back and start from scratch.   A NY strip steak had the appearance, texture and taste of a sirloin you would get from the meat department right before its expiration date. Side dishes were sadly the highlight, which isn't saying much. Damn, I wish I remembered the other aspects of this horrible meal but its probably a good thing I don't.   I will rejoice when I hear this place has closed down and Jean Georges has decided to retire from the restaurant biz.",

    "text": "Well, all I can say is WOW! I was very impressed with Jean Georges Steakhouse. From the stunningly dark, sexy room, to the phenomenal - let me repeat, absolutely phenomenal service, to the incredible meal; Jean Georges Steakhouse is at the top of my list for Las Vegas Steakhouses.  We booked in for a Saturday night meal for 8 of us to celebrate my hubbys Birthday and I am so glad we chose this spot. It was fun, upscale yet comfortable. Not too loud that we couldn't have a conversation as a table. The wait staff works as a team to make sure you are well taken care of. We never had to reach for the bottle of wine, our glass was always being topped up, and when the bottle was near empty, another was there to replace it. The bread to start is very good - I am picky and loooove good bread!. Then the meal, wow. Mouth watering good. I opted for the seafood platter while most went for steak and my Father-in-law went with the sea bass. Not a single complaint... well, we did all think that the side dishes of asparagus, brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and mac n cheese were all a bit small. For $16 a side, they should be a bit more significant. All though if it's a meal for two, I guess they would be fine.   They had a photographer that came out to take pictures, and a lava cake on the house with Happy Birthday written on it. All in all, it was just a wonderful evening and I am so thankful we chose it. I would 100% go back.",

    "text": "After attending the uncorkd event at Caesars the night before where the food and service was wonderful, my husband and I were underwhelmed by our experience at Jean George the next night.  We arrived about 30 minutes ahead of our reservation, where the hostess checked us in and informed us that they were seating at scheduled times and invited us to sit at the bar or in the area outside.  We didn't mind and returned about 5 minutes beforehand where the three hostesses just smiled and looked at us and went on talking to themselves.  We finally had to interrupt them and ask when we would be seated as it was past our reservation time.  Surprisingly, the hostess said \"oh, why didn't you check in...we were wondering to ourselves why you were standing there and why hadn't we checked in\". I kindly reminded her that we had checked in 20 minutes before...we received some lame excuse about the system being reset.  Neither she nor the other 2 hostesses could be bothered enough to ask whether we needed anything and let us stand there for almost 10 minutes.  Our experience did improve a bit after being seated in a fairly empty restaurant and our server was very friendly, although the time between courses was fairly long.  I will say my husband's short rib dish was excellent and did not disappoint.  My sea bass, while cooked well, was drowning in the soy-yuzu glaze and could have been any piece of fish at that point.  And to top off the evening, we were surprised to have a photographer ask us if we would like a photograph taken in the midst of dinner - as though we were at a cheesy attraction instead of a fine dining restaurant.",

    "text": "This is supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the country. I was super excited to eat here, but it is nothing special.  I've eaten at every famous steakhouse you can name. SW, STK, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Mark Joseph, Del Frisco's, Porterhouse, Michael Jordan's, BLT, Wolfgang, 212, Striphouse, Uncle Jack's, BLT Prime, Bobby Van, Frankie & Johnnie's, Smith & Wollensky, Charlie Palmer, Palm, Capitol Grill, N9NE, Echo & Rig... and these are all better than JG.  I don't eat meat anymore, so I ordered shrimp cocktail, burrata salad, and the diver scallops.  I have high expectations of service here, and most were met, but it can be the little things that make it less than fabulous.  Our front waiter was a nice, experienced girl who was well versed in the menu and restaurant but has no idea when to stop, as in she doesn't shut up. She over sells. She can't read people. And she comes across as totally like a robot.  Her job is over once she takes your order.  Then the food expediters and back waiter take over.  My shrimp cocktail came with two sauces. The cocktail sauce was watery and ordinary and not even enough to consume the 4 large shrimp. I have no idea what the other sauce was but it was not appealing. I was dipping my shrimp in the cocktail sauce and was already down two shrimp when the back waiter showed up with my spoons to use on the sauce.  Bring me what I need to enjoy the food BEFORE the food shows up, so that was a strike against the type of service I expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  Then my Burrata salad arrived and it was only mediocre.  The tomatoes were so cold, which tomatoes are not supposed to be, they lose their flavor, and the homemade burrata had a great texture but no flavor.  I think this salad was not freshly made but was premade and sat in a cooler because  the tomatoes were just under frozen.  Then the scallops arrived.  They were topped with bread crumbs and laid on a very spicy sauce, and I love spice but this one was just not a good one. It was spice with dill, which I don't think is a good combination. I only at half before I was sick of the sauce.  I expect scallops to be crispy on the outside and tender inside. These were tender through out and just uneventful.  One guest had a filet mignon. It came perfectly cooked as he requested medium. What I don't understand is the mint sauce they include with every sauce. I like the presentation, that the sauce arrives in a marrow bone with a tiny spoon.  However, they then bring four more sauces, one is bearnaise, and the rest I didn't pay close enough attention.  I have never been to a steakhouse of this caliber that offers this many sauces, and we all thought it was overkill to bring five. Why is one on the plate and then four on the side. It's odd. I think if a steak needs a sauce, it either sucks or the diner has a very amateur palette.  Other guest got salmon & shrimp and she enjoyed that.  We got the lobster mashed potatoes, which are really puree, like baby food. I don't care for that. It's nearly a soup. It tasted good but was too runny to get on your fork.  We also ordered the creamed corn, which isn't creamed corn at all.  It's fancy corn.  It tasted good, but wasn't what we expected.  They removed the corn from the husk and throw spices on it.  It's not creamy at all.  And we had fries, which tasted good, but I didn't feel at all they were freshly cut fries which was shocking. They were too perfect shaped and in their consistency, like they were mass produced and from a frozen bag and air fried.",

I started with a Lychee Raspberry Bellini (Fresh Lychee, Raspberry, Prosecco) and it was just the perfect amount of sweetness.  We shared the Crispy Sushi Sampler with chipotle mayonnaise & crispy rice which was delicious.  I'm not sure it was worth $24, but that's what you get on that menu.  For my entree I had the USDA Prime Beef 8 oz Filet Mignon which was cooked perfectly.  My husband had, and loved, the Waygu.  We had a side of the Roasted Trumpet Mushrooms with garlic, jalapeno & lemon and we were fighting over the last forkful- SO GOOD!  We also had the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese which my husband LOVED, but I thought was lacking a little salt.  I'd totally go back and I'd probably opt to sit at the bar.  Great food, great vibe!",

    "text": "Two of my coworkers and I visited Jean-Georges Steakhouse last week since we had resort credit at Aria that was setting our pockets en fuego.  We knew it would be pricey and expected the food to be delectable.  Both assumptions were proven to be accurate.  Decor is posh.  Lots of abstract cow faces all about the room (once you arrive, you'll see what I mean).  Also enhancing the decor is the group of constant gawkers standing in front of the restaurant who look at the menu and gaze inside, hoping to see a celebrity or otherwise rich person.  My meal was fantastic.  An uncannily delicious Caesar salad started my evening.  Lemony, light, and topped with fresh, mouthwatering Romano.  Maybe my favorite Caesar of recent years.  The freebie breads were also tasty, adding a nice bit of peripheral value to the high prices of the dishes.  Next came the main course - 12 oz. filet, cooked rare-med rare, with creamed spinach and some shared asparagus.  The steak was lovely - seared on the outside, warm and red middle, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable.  My 12 ouncer was more like a solid pound of filet, thus keeping the enjoyment alive for a few more savory minutes.  The sides were both excellently prepared, with the asparagus being a wonderful surprise.  Simultaneously, I enjoyed a Hitachino Nest White Ale, a beer I'd never before tried.  This added another bit of happiness to an already memorable meal.  My only \"Eh, Not so Sure About This\" at Jean-Georges was the service.  Our primary server was attentive as is to be expected at both a high-end steakhouse and at a restaurant with only 4 other customers present (we went early).  On the other hand, the server's assistants were quite clumsy and made several fumbles during our meal.  For example, one assistant acted as though the thought of a split check was the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics and I'm fairly sure a tear came to his eye when I asked that unforgivable inquiry.  Additionally, one assistant poured a colleague's bottled beverage into the cups of the other people at our table who weren't enjoying this beverage, effectively mixing two things that did not mix and wasting my colleague's investment.  On the whole, I provide a strong recommendation for this restaurant.  I suggest going around 6:30; that way you beat the rush but can enjoy the show.  Viva!",

The music - outstanding eclectic (Snoop Doggs Sensual Seduction, Hot Chips Ready for the Floor are the only two I can remember) 3. Service - we had a funky gal named Dorris serve us.  She was sweet with a dash of fiery.  I would go back to see her. For food, I got the seared Fois Gras (priced at $34).  The piece was larger than most places.  The outside seemed a bit hard at first look but as soon as I cut into the livery goodness, it was just right.  The fig and mushrooms just added to the spectacular appetizer dish.  I also got the pear/apple endive salad ($20) and it was also just perfect.  They didn't go crazy on the blue cheese (thank god). My friend got the cheese crusted chicken ($30).  It was cooked perfectly.  He preferred the white meat cutlet over the dark meat which was fine for me since I got to have the dark meat! HA!  The cheese was light and not overbearing at all.  It was just crusted on one side of the cutlets so if you decided you didn't really want the cheese crusts, you could easily bypass and just eat the meat. Friend also got the butter nut squash soup which he said was tasty though he felt was very rich in cream. ($15)   Definitely high-priced but its always a good feeling to know that you actually got high-quality for that high-price.  I would go back though nervous about getting any steaks based on the reviews on Yelp.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had Valentine's Day dinner here this year.  I've eaten at the Jean-Georges in NYC for lunch several years ago and remembered having a great experience.  So I thought we give this place a try since it's new.  Although, we already know how hard it is to find any steak place better than Mastros or Cut.  But I'm still waiting to find something that I can is better...which Jean-Georges Steakhouse did not even come close.  It's a really nice place.  I love the decor.  From the moment we spotted the restaurant outside with the amazing decor at the entrance until we were seated at our table, I was truly impressed with the design.  However, I didn't really like the way the tables were set-up.  Considering it was V-day, we were seated right next to two other tables and really didn't get much privacy.  For appetizers, we shared calamari and bone marrow.  This was literally the best calamari I've ever tasted.  The batter was very light and crisp and it was accompanied by a tasty mayo-like dipping sauce.  The bone marrow was decent, but I have to say Cut and Charlie Palmer prepares this dish much better.  The toast that came with the bone marrow was good though.  We shared an 18 oz rib-eye and selected the bernaise and soy-butter miso sauce on the side.  The steak was cooked to perfection...I really haven't seen a medium rare steak cooked that way before.  It was very juicy and tender, but it lacked the flavors found at our fav steakhouse - Mastros.  Each steak comes with their house special sauce...which tasted somewhat like salsa verde.    The drinks were good and strong.  After two cocktails, we were both feeling quite tipsy. :)  Nonetheless, I am still a fan of Jean-Georges and will continue trying his other restaurants.  However, I'm not sure if I really care to return to his Las Vegas location.  Especially when they just opened a Mastros Ocean Club inside the new Crystals at City Center.",

The steak itself is okay, but I would agree with other posters that are better options nearby.  My gripe involves the soda policy and the mashed potatoes.  They charge $4.50 per soda, and push refills agressively without telling you it is not free refills.  Even after finishing my entire meal, the waitress asked again and luckily I said no.  My advice is order a coke, but ask for just two ice cubes, they fill a glass with ice and you get almost no soda.  The mashed potatoes taste fine, but they are runny and should not be if they are to be good mashed potatoes.",

It seems a petty complaint, but the restaurant is slightly dim and the flashes were pretty bright.",

There was one Caesar Salad ordered and was told that it was good.  Main courses were fillet's and NY strip with sides of a baked potato, parmesan mashed potatoes and caramelized brussel sprouts.  They brought out several sauces, but everyone seemed to gravitate to the soy ginger.  The steaks were cooked to perfection with amazing flavor.  Now, for dessert;  We ordered the caramelized banana cake with caramel ice cream and it was amazing!  OMG!   Overall, this was my favorite restaurant on our trip to Vegas.",

It would have been nice if we were told about this when we made our reservation 6 weeks ago or even when we confirmed.. Surprise Surprise!  The portions were very small which may be expected since there were 5 courses.. At $175 per person I would expect some wine pairing.. Sea Bass was very much over salted.. I did enjoy the lamb which I chose over the tenderloin.. But I had my heart set on a real steak... not lamb or tenderloin.. I would have traded all those little portions for a fat juicy steak... While eating I kept closing my eyes wishing I was at a Morton's.. Do your customers a favor and tell them about the fixed menu in advance.. Place is probably good when not on, yes I'm going to mention it again, the fixed menu.  Lame!",

This is a top tier restaurant, people.  Yes, it is expensive, but that's part of it's m.o.  Think special occasion dinner, or just a regular Tuesday evening for a millionaire.  Everything we ate was fantastic - steak that melted in our mouths, scrumptious lobster, perfectly cooked asparagus.    One star off due to an issue over the price of the wine we ordered.  There was a miscommunication between us and the waiter resulting in a few hundred dollar error - something we were not about to pay.  It took quite a bit of dignified squabbling for it be sorted out.  In total, our bill for three people, with the correct bottle of wine, salads, entrees, two sides, pre- and post-dinner drinks, and a dessert: $450 including tip.    If you're nearby, this ia a great option.  If you're a little bit north, check out the Country Club at the Wynn.",

But because the prices here, Iike so many places in Vegas, were significantly inflated, I'd like to think I could expect elevated levels of originality and flavor in the food. Not so.  I split the porterhouse steak and the sauteed corn with a friend, and both dishes were good. Not amazing, but good. I was honestly more interested in the corn -- the mix of citrus and spice was really delicious (it kind of reminded me of elote) -- than in the $140 steak.   The service was worthy of five stars, but service alone isn't going to be enough for me to go back in a city where there are tons of other options for delicious food.",

    "text": "Let's get this out of the way. Everything in Vegas is insanely expensive. I'm not sure why, I guess because they can get it. People come to Vegas to blow some money, and hopefully make some more money that they can then blow. If you make the mistake of ordering a beer at the bar of a casino rather than from a cocktail waitress, a 16oz Miller Lite will set you back $9.   If you go into Jean Georges with that mindset, that dinner will likely cost you more than a normal, really good steakhouse, you should enjoy yourself. Also, from our experience, you could certainly taste the difference in cuts and kind of meat and I would advise splurging on higher end. You're going to spend some money, might as well enjoy yourself.  Case in point, two of us ordered the waygu filet (6oz), the other the NY strip (14oz). While you obviously get more with the strip, the waygu absolutely melted in your mouth while the strip, probably just by comparison after tasting both, was just okay.   We also collectively had the caesar salad, the tuna tartare, the grilled octopus, and the crunchy potatoes, all of which were very good. The octopus in particular was a table favorite and cooked perfectly. I liked that the menu featured a pretty broad range of options: a chicken dish, a burger, lots of various seafood entrees and sides. For being a steakhouse, you could avoid red meat entirely and have a really good meal.  Service was fine. Professional is probably the word I would use, though I think I would have liked the lady's waiter with the bad jokes more.   If you're feeling flush, this is a fantastic way to spend a lot of money.",

By the time we all got our dinners, the food was cold. The manager was a disaster in handling. Let it be clear, money is not the object here. The surly attitude and abject unwillingness to offer any sort of suitable remedy for the debacle on the part of Jeffery was dismissal worthy, were I the owner of this establishment. Terrible experience. On a side note, our actual server was quite pleasant and seemed as much a victim of this goat rope as we were. Avoid.

My other big gripe is the availability of cuts on the menu. There were 12 cuts of steak offered on the menu but they were out of 7 of them! If you're stocking such low levels of certain cuts, make them specials instead of putting them on the menu - or at least tell us you're out before you hand out the menus, so we don't pick 3 cuts and get told each time that you've run out. That's just terrible.  Service was just OK; again, at this price point I expect better attentiveness and professionalism. I did really like my wedge salad and all the sides we got - but who goes to a steakhouse for salad and sides?",

On A Thursday night at 7pm - out of Brussels sprouts.  The bread they delivered at the start of the meal was nothing but white bread that quickly became stale.  Not like rice crackers with peanut sauce or something more memorable.  I asked the waiter about getting trumpet mushrooms as a side when my entree came with mushrooms and he told me it wasn't that much-  it definitely was.  There were more mushrooms with my entree than actual fish.  Sea bass came over cooked.  And the waiter didn't check back in enough time for them to remake it while my husband was eating his steak.  Flavors for the tuna tartare - not enough ginger soy sauce as we have come to expect at Dune on Paradise a island or at jean George's restaurant in New York.  Jean Georges usually so good with balance of flavors and sauces... disappointing.  Disappointing and overpriced.",

    "text": "Ugh 2/2 FAIL for me. I visited once in 2017 for a New Years meal and they took FOREVER to have our food out to us! We were staying at Aria so it was easy to arrange for dinner and to meet with our party, but we got there at 6:30 and didn't get out until after 10 as the food came out at 8:30 to 9. I don't even remember how the food tasted as we were infuriated about the slow service and the lack of remorse from the staff.  This past year in August of 2018, my husband made a surprise reservation for my 30th birthday, party of 6. He accidentally told me his plans a few days before we departed for Vegas and I expressed my concerns but we decided to give Jean George another chance thinking the first time was a fluke. Our reservation was at 6:30 and we were seated promptly, placed our order and at 8pm our dinner still has not come out! I was horrified to learn that this became a repeat of last year! We had our Backstreet Boys Concert to attend that very night and did not want to miss getting to our VIP seats as the tickets were very very expensive! We let the maitre d' know and they kept Falsely reassuring us that our dinner was coming. It was such a LONG process of waiting but what can we do at this point; it was too late to catch dinner at another place and then go to the concert! Finally our food came out and part of it was room temperature, a small portion of it had cooled off but we were so short of time that we took a few bites then left. It was the most unsatisfying meal ever as we were now so rushed to depart. We complained several times and had the manager come out to apologize and offer us his business card. Um... seriously, what good does this do? Ridiculous. They offered to take an item off the check which they never did. And the manager even offered to walk us over to the concert venue, but walked us over to the MGM where Lionel Richie was performing! He wasted more of our time and money. We ended up missing the opening act of the show due to the faulty service of this restaurant.   If you have important plans later that night, I highly suggest having dinner at another restaurant! It takes 2-2.5 hours from seating for food to arrive. I cannot believe this place dropped the ball twice. I expected so much more from such a highly regarded restaurant. This was very disappointing; we will not be returning! This restaurant is very distasteful in service and timeliness. The only good thing that deserves the one star is photos taken at our table by Aria service to entertain us some while we waited.  Thousands of $$$$ spent on sorrow = tears and regret. I implore you, DON'T DO IT.",

    "text": "My fiance had heard great things about this restaurant and decided to bring me here for my surprise birthday weekend in Vegas. (Brief Back Story-everything, including the people who came & places we went.) this was night #2 and we had the whole party together at this point. We had been pool partying all day and worked up quite an appetite. We made a reservation for 7 people for 7:00pm. We arrived a few minutes early and took many photos of ourselves in the lobby area while we waited. Promptly at 7:00pm, we were escorted over to our tanks. It was a great big table in the middle of the restaurant-prime real estate. The menus are big and heavy which was comical to us but I'm seeing that more & more at fine dining restaurants. We were greeted by our server who explained the courses they offered & the specials available that evening. It being a steakhouse and all, most of us ordered steak and others ordered seafood. We shared some appetizers and salads while we waited for our meals. We also we enjoyed a round of martinis as well. Delicious (but small). Our meals came out timely and shortly after our appetizers. We were a little off put because our original server sort of left and we didn't know who our next server was, so we had to track down someone who looked like they worked there. Finally, our original server emerged and was seemingly irritated that we had ordered from someone else. We were all pleased with our meals, but real key player that I remember was the lobster mashed potatoes. They were so delicious I think I filled up, mostly on that. That is definitely a staple when you go there. I believe it was part of a special but that you can order it normally as a side. Of course my friends and family told the servers that it was my birthday so they brought out a small chocolate treat, which I can't really call a cake. It was a hardshell chocolate with a little mousse in the middle. I was able to blow out my candles and be done with dinner. We were in and out in about one hour. Prices are definitely on the high side because it is fine dining, and it is Vegas. The food is worth it, though. Keep in mind, most of the steaks and seafood are a la carte and you must also purchase your sides. We got a few sides for the table and all shared. That worked out well for us. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This was my favorite.  So much so, after eating there I ate at others in Vegas, Cabo San Lucas, New York and Beverly Hills in the last year.  Last night, after a crappy week, we decided to splurge on JG steakhouse.   Imagine walking into a less then half-seated restaurant and being out at the most uncomfortable table for 2 for no reason that was discernible.   Had it been the last table available, it would have been our choice to take it or leave it.  Given there were dozens of other tables, it was an insult.  How does a place that bar none makes the best short-rib in the world, use pre-made sour mix , a bottled mariciano cherries and charge 18 per drink?  The rest of the meal was excellent, but the dry aged NY none is steak.  It just wasn't delicious like all our other food.  Combined with seating issue, this has dropped off the favorites in Vegas.  Why go back with another 100 excellent places to go when in Vegas.  Not mention, we miss the corn souffle desert.",

One of the people in our group ordered the burger well done and the lady said our food was taking so long because it takes 45 minutes to an hour to cook a hamburger well done.   This place is mediocre at best and way too much money. Go somewhere else if you want decent food - like one of the casino buffets.",

The waiter who approached the table almost immediately took our orders and then the next time we saw him was after we had asked another waiter for our check. Other staff who helped in the meantime were great. Especially a waitress named Christina who intervened to help us pair our meal with wine. We had the ribeye and New York steaks with the truffle mac n' cheese and artichoke as sides. Again, the food was amazing. We had a red wine from Tuscany which was probably the best wine I've ever tried... and I've been wine tasting in Tuscany. The table across from us was occupied by the Dallas Cowboys. And people think famous people only go to Hollywood - HAH!",

It wasn't great but it was very plain. Then, my husband had steak. Now, this is a steakhouse so I would assume they would make an incredible steak, it was not. He ordered it medium, to came RARE, like, so rare you couldn't eat it. Which again, I think if I'm going to a specialty restaurant they can cook what they're supposed to cook. For the price especially.   The sides were great, I'll say that, but your side dishes shouldn't be what you take away when you go to an upscale dinner. I wouldn't dine here again.",

My hubs and I started off with the chilled seafood platter which comes with clams, mussels, king crab leg, shrimp, and a lobster tail.  the seafood was top quality and really fresh.  Only need a squirt of lemon and a dip in the cocktail sauce.   We then shared the 36oz Porterhouse steak.  I'm not big on red meat, but this steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The steak comes with 4 dipping sauces.  My fav was the Bearnaise. Also ordered a side of TRUFFLE mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.   Everything was delicious.   As a surprise, they brought out a warm chocolate cake and scoop of ice cream.  What a nice treat.    Overall, we spent mad money on this meal, but it's Vegas so what cha gonna do.",

Jean George is always on that list.  The food is fantastic. The service is 5 star.  We started with an bunch of appetizers that were awesome.  The carpaccio is a must!  The crab cake was mostly crab and the bacon wrapped shrimp, well get 2 orders cause one is just not enough.  The service is great. They use a team system that always leaves someone near by to get you that extra glass of wine or additional bread and butter.  The steaks are cooked to perfection.  And the GM always stops by and shares some of the recipes and history of the restaurant and Chef Jean George with my guests.  This is a must when in Vegas!",

We were a group of five and shared the porterhouse, the rib eye, the chicken, black truffle Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. The rib eye was delicious with just the right amount of fat. The porterhouse was somewhat chewy on the new York strip side. Interestingly, the chicken was super delicious with a crispy outside and a tender inside. The chicken came with this spicy buttery sauce that was just perfect. They serve their meats with a variety of sauces but the chimichurri was my fav. The sides were small but good. My fav was the truffle Mac and cheese. For all of us, it was $350 I believe with two cocktails. Service was pretty slow though.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of Jean Georges. I have been to their steakhouse in Scottsdale a few times but this was the first visit to the one in Aria. The menu was pretty similar but they decor and atmosphere were very different. Oddly enough, the one in Scottsdale seems much more vibrant and fun. This one was a bit dark and stodgy. But maybe I just felt that way because it was pretty empty (we were there right when they opened at 5pm) and also our waitress was a bit stiff. It was fun to see the modern art interpretation of the cows face on the wall and udders over the bar.  I was happy to see online that they had a pre-theater early bird special tasting menu for only $69 which included soup or salad, choice of 3 entrees, and a dessert. The waitress didn't offer this up as a choice so be sure to ask for that menu if you interested. She also kind of downplayed the value saying that it wouldn't be enough food unless you ordered additional sides anyway. In the end we decided to order off the regular menu. Hubby got a porterhouse with a Caesar salad as his starter and mashed potatoes as his side (everything is a la carte here). He absolutely loved his steak and potatoes but the Caesar was one of the worst we've ever seen. Hunks of lettuce, gobs of bland dressing and then parmesan shreds that looked like they had been grated hours if not days before. For $16 you would just expect better. That is a pretty high price for an appetizer sized salad. As for me, I started with the butternut squash soup and that did not disappoint. They do the bit where they bring you the bowl and then pour the soup in tableside. That seems to be a thing at high end restaurants nowadays. For my entree I ordered the short rib and let me tell you that definitely the best value on the menu. Even though it was only one rib, it had a decent amount of meat on it... probably 6 oz at least. And it was well seasoned with a caramelized sauce and a good char on the outside. Very delicious. And it came with some pieces of fried polenta that were delicious as well. Crispy on the outside and rich and creamy on the inside. I wish I would have realized that this would be so much food because I also ordered a side dish, the Brussels sprouts which I didn't really have room for. These were pretty bland and boring so no loss there, except the $12 I paid for them.  After our meal we agreed that we didn't have any major complaints about the food (other than the high prices) but the service was a little intrusive. Our waitress kind of hovered over us. She also kept pressuring us to order more drinks. When we received the bill we were shocked to see that we were charged $4.50 for each diet coke my husband drank. I guess there are no refills, which I understand some restaurants do, but $4.50 for a small glass of fountain soda with no alcohol in it is just ridiculous. For this reason alone we will likely not return. I also saw that my wine was $18 a glass even though I am fairly certain that on the menu it was listed as $11 a glass (I ordered the Malbec). By this time we didn't have time to argue because needed to get to our show (we had tickets to see Zarkana). Also since it was our anniversary we didn't want to get into a negative confrontation with the waitress who seemed like a real odd bird anyway. I will say it was nice that she brought out a small dessert for free for our anniversary but it was not really welcome since we had already said that we were too full for dessert and in a hurry to go.",

    "text": "Wow, talk about a huge disappointment. We went here with a party of 10.  I'll break our experience down to two parts. Service and food.   Our waiter was not good. Don't know how else to say it. The lowlights included us having to ask for him to come to the table to get drink orders as he never greeted us. Him forgetting drink orders throughout the meal requiring us to remind him. Asking for him again to come take our orders. Having to ask for bread 35 mins after being sat. Etc, etc, etc. Just an overall lack of being a quality waiter. Our meal took 2.5 hrs and that was not because of us. And not that I mind as I understand it's policy at many places, but the restaurant put the auto 18% gratuity on top of it for the crappy service.  We are at Lavo (great dining, service and atmosphere) and when we told our waiter there about our JG experience, he said that the dining room service is known to be bad at JG. Could have used that advice the day before. So now you have it, there are too many great steak houses to waste your time here.   As for the food, half our table was very happy with their meals. Those with the filets thought they were great. Those with seafood likes their meals. The ones with the ribeyes were extremely disappointed. Tough, very fatty just poor quality. Honestly I had trouble cutting my ribeye with the steak knife. That should not happen. I buy ribeyes from my local grocery store and they are way better than what this place served. It's hard to F up a ribeye, but somehow this steakhouse did.   So there you have it. Find another steakhouse and avoid this place. You might get good food, you might not. But the service is probably going to be poor and that's just not acceptable for premium dining when there are so many Vegas options.",

Down to earth and relaxed, but attentive and professional! His experience was obvious and appreciated. Ramon was superb! Pano the manager was a gem to talk with and watched over our needs every step of the way. He showed impressive skills as a calm-soothing executive presence and like a great manager, went out of his way to make us feel #1. Jean George at the Aria Las Vegas is a fine dining establishment with impeccable service and food. My rib-eye steak, bone-in was delicious, full of flavor and joy. My wife had the Chilean Sea Bass and loved it! She said it was equal if not better than Hakkasan at the MGM. We will go back again soon! Get to know the staff because they really care about making things right! -Tommy D. San Diego",

    "text": "Amazing. Truly amazing.   I was in Vegas for a conference and had the chance for expense account dining (always the best). I was staying at the Mandarin and had planned to go to Ruth's Chris, but wanted something new and found this place. I tried to find a menu, or just some ideas on the prices, but didn't, but went anyway, alone.  My reservation was for 6 p.m. and I had my ribeye at 6:30 (and out the door at 7:15). Great service. I had the 18-ounce ribeye ($68), a wedge salad, and an apple pie dessert. Plus Pellegrino. The salad and dessert were fine, the ribeye was sublime. I used to cook \"professionally\" (okay, it was Golden Corral) and have been a steak connoisseur for many years. Trust me, this ribeye was extraordinary.   I love ribeye but hate having a small pile of fat left over. That wasn't the case with this cut. MAYBE I actually consumed more fat than I usually would (my table wasn't exceptionally well lit), but it didn't seem like it. It had a perfect partial sear for that semi-crusty exterior and it was a perfect medium. So flavorful. I almost never put anything on my steaks, but the salsa verde that came with it was a revelation. There were four other sauces and they were fine. I ate probably 1/3 of the meat without anything.   Two nights before this meal I dined at Smith and Wollensky, where I also had a large ribeye. It was much better at Jean Georges.    I hope to visit Jean Georges again.",

But since it was Thanksgiving, they made an exception. When we sat down, they said they had no high chairs available. My 2 yr old twins, where no comfortable. When the waiter came over, he was very rude. Not what I expected on Thanksgiving. After serving us water, I was told to have my kids behave. Gerti, a restaurant employee made this comment. I was stunned, I quickly asked him if he was joking. No he said, keep them quiet. Stay away from this place!!!!",

We has no reservations and just showed up around 8:00pm and we got seated within 10 minutes. The staff here are amazing and very attentive! Now to the good part, what I had to eat:  - 18 oz. Bone in Rib Eye: This was cooked to perfection and oh so flavorful good! My friend and I decided to split this as a meal and the server asked if we would like the rib eye cut for us which was perfect for us splitting!  - Grilled Maine Lobster: This comes with two perfectly cooked maine lobster tails. I'm glad it came with two because this was another dish me and my friend decided to share. (We made our own \"Surf N Turf\" dinner)  - Black Truffle Mac N Cheese and their Truffled Mashed Potatoes: These were the two sides we decided to order and split between three girls. The portions were perfect. The mashed potatoes were one of the best I ever had. You will not be disappointed if you order any of these sides. It was also a recommendation made by our server.  If you come here for your birthday, you get a free dessert of your choice and they bring it out with a lit candle and writing in chocolate on the plate saying \"Happy Birthday\"  Their wine selection here is amazing! This was the very first place that I have ever been to that allows you to order Silveroak by the glass. My favorite!!!",

    "text": "Dined here on a Monday night, when the casino and restaurant were not a busy.  Made a reservation in advance, showed up on time and were seated right away.  The restaurant is a little on the dark side (lighting) but still easy to read the menu.    The server approached quickly and took drink orders and reviewed the menu and answered questions.  The restaurant quickly filled up but the noise level was reasonable.  The menu has the usual steakhouse offerings with some additional modern twists on salads, appetizers, entrees and sides.  Nicely thought out menu with literally something for everyone.    I had what was called the organic crunchy chicken and my dining companion had the New York strip.  I had their version of pea soup and my companion had the wedge salad.  My soup was delicious and nicely prepared.  The wedge salad was nicely done with not too much dressing.  Steak and chicken came out soon after salads, Timing was good and we weren't rushed.  Both dishes were prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  Our server came over several times during the meal to check on things but was not intrusive.  A great dining experience.  The only odd thing was that during dinner, a light bulb or fixture exploded over our heads and a large (about 6 or 7 inches) metal rod came down from the ceiling and hit my dining companion.  A bit startling and a little disturbing.  The general manager eventually came over to apologize but not much else.  Had it been over about another 2 inches, it would have struck my friend in the head, but instead struck him in the shoulder.  Not sure what was happening there but it was somewhat dangerous.    Other than the exploding light fixture, the dinner was amazing.",

Can't blame the waitress really, as she's the only one in the bar area. Vegas has certainly changed. $28 glass of wine and a 1/4 glass full. I'm  not being cheap, I have no problem paying for quality. The restaurant is ridiculous. Warm water in glasses, no utensils, stingy pours of wine and lack  of service. However, the food is spectacular! I'm just saying, $300 later, for 2 people,should have felt like this was a superior experience. As a guest Staying at Aria, would have expected more. Will chose another location next time.",

    "text": "We had a family dinner at Jean Georges Steakhouse last Saturday. Both my husband and I ordered the tasting menu. My in laws ordered 18 OZ BONE-IN RIB EYE, CARAMELIZED DIVER SCALLOPS, and 8 OZ FILET MIGNON.   Service * The sommelier (wine steward?) was very knowledgeable. He gave us two recommendations based on our preferences and the rib-eye we ordered. He was also very attentive.  However, our server was not very attentive. For the tasting menu we ordered, he didn't even introduce any dish when he served them. This is the first time that I had tasting menu at a nice restaurant without servers introducing the dishes. It was a little bit disappointing. On top of that, the three sides we ordered didn't come with our entrees. We waited for extra 15 to 20 minutes for the side dishes to come. My in-law had to eat his rib-eye slowly for 20 minutes, waiting for the mashed potato, mushrooms, and asparagus. Very unprofessional.  Food *** The food was fine, considering how it's priced, I think it can be a little bit better. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu. The TUNA TARTARE doesn't taste any different from any regular restaurant. The THREE GRAIN SALAD (Beets, Goat Cheese & Herbs) tasted the same as the one at the Cheesecake Factory (One of my favorite salad there). The scallop dish came with sugar snap peas and vines didn't amaze us, either.  I would recommend the salmon and the WAGYU TENDERLOIN. The wagyu tenderloin was tender, juicy and full of flavors. The salmon dish was well-presented and it was delicious. It was actually the best salmon I have ever had. Not just the way it was cooked, but also the quality of the fish itself.   Overall ** We had our best dining experience at Jean Georges, New York. That's why we were excited to visit its steakhouse in Aria this time. However, it didn't meet our expectations. :(",

    "text": "This establishment was participating in Las Vegas' restaurant week and they had an interesting menu, so I decided to dine here.  I had eaten here before and had a positive experience the last time around, but it was even better today.  There were four courses provided with a choice for three of them.  The meal started out with the tomato gazpacho which was pretty tasty.  I appreciated the cool temperature of the soup, especially on such a hot day in Vegas.    The heirloom tomato panzanella salad came next and was pretty darn good.  All of the ingredients were fresh and the star of the dish, the tomatoes, were sweet and juicy and there were a good amount of them in the dish.  The only issue I had with the dish was that the dried bread chunks were a bit too big and should have been cut a little smaller since it was kind of a pain to cut them into bite sized pieces with the butter knife.  I opted for the medium-rare cooked filet mignon which was accompanied with mustard greens and topped with some fine curly, string onions.  There was a cherry mustard sauce which packed an nice punch.  I could have done without the onions and the steak was the weakest link of the meal, but it was still pretty good.  I opted for the bone marrow sides which was very interesting.  Three half bones cut lengthwise exposed the marrow, and a spoon was used to scoop out the marrow to apply on a small slab of toasted bread and parsley lemon gremolata was added to top it off.  The bone marrow itself didn't do much for me - it was kind of tasteless to me and the purpose seemed to be to just leave an oily residue on the bread to make it a little soggy but the gremolata was pretty delicious and made the dish work.  For the dessert, I opted for the white chocolate pavlova which was a real winner.  The crust had a nice delicate texture that melted in my mouth.  I typically go for sweet desserts but the meringue was nice and delicate and overall it was a very interesting dish.    Service was great and my server Eddie was knowledgeable and friendly.  The bill totalled ~ $100 but it was well worth it.",

    "text": "Fantastic Steaks, chill ambiance (especially pleasing in Vegas), with a low low low techno-groove soundtrack, and comfortable (semi-dark) lighting make this a much-needed unwinding alternative to all the damn noise in sin city!   Amazing bread service, within 5-7 minutes of being seated; hyper-professional and efficient waitstaff got everything out in quick fashion and never missed a beat. Our water glasses were filled numerous times without us being aware (minor wine buzz?), and we were taken care of for a good two hours. I've been to countless excellent steakhouses (and some legendary) from coast to coast, and this was one of the best filets I've ever had; my colleague said same about his 12 oz. strip steak. The sides were fairly typical of a prime steakhouse but nonetheless, outstanding in quantity and quality.  I'm shocked that with the 5-star service offered up here, plus the 4 complimentary steak sauces presented to every table (how's that for a differentiator), plus the USDA prime beef combined with the ambiance, how this place gets 3.5 stars on Yelp? Obviously, too many complainers bitching about some trivial aspect (as in: my drink was weak, wahhhhh) that prompted them to give this excellent steakhouse a poor review, but my experience was close to 5 stars. When I go back to Aria Hotel, I'm also going back to Jean Georges. Thanks guys, great meal for both myself and business partner. I will return.",

We were so full after the apps we all had leftovers and I forgot to take pictures! Based on my party they loved the steak, the salads, I believe they also had bone marrow.

The lobster tail was huge..the biggest we've encountered yet. My filet as excellent but nothing compared to Wagyu, which was tender beyond words. Samples of all their homemade sauces came out  with our entrees..all were great.  As far as the side go, the garlic mashed potatoes were perfected, the creamed spinach not so much.

Steaks from $54.00 to $260.00 for a 6 oz Kobe Filet imported from Japan. I had the NY Strip. I've had better food at Long Horn. The only thing I can figure is that their rent must be very high.",

The decor was nice - a sophisticated, dark modern feel that was great for the group.  And the service was great. We got a great deal of attention from a very knowledgeable staff without feeling overwhelmed by their presence and check-ins. I would recommend.",

Checked in for dinner. We all dressed very casual, meaning shorts and t-shirts. I heard that this place has Wagyu Kobe Beef. We came here for that purpose only.  Here it is.  1. Calamari = It was decent calamari. This is the kind of calamari appetizer I would like to find in other places. Crispy, crunchy, and chewy. 2. Tuna Rice *something* = It was probably one of the best appetizer that I have ever got in my life 3. Maine Lobster Tail = It was one of the entree we chose. It was very light. I didn't expect the lobster to be cooked so well and perfect. The sauce was perfect. I found that there was a hint of coriander in the sauce. The sauce was light too. 4. NY Strip Wagyu Kobe Beef - It MELTED in my mouth. One of the best meat I've ever eaten. We ordered 4 oz which costed $19 per oz. It was worth it. The flavor in meat was not overpowering the texture of the Wagyu beef. 5. Filet Mignon Wagyu Kobe Beef- THIS IS AN ORGASM! The three of us sample this delicacy, and we all agreed that this was the BEST FOOD ORGASM ever. The meat melted in your mouth. It was so juicy, tender, and you name it all. It was ORGASMIC 6. Filet Mignon Steak - Okay, after having that orgasm in your mouth, this meat tasted like rubber? The flavor was well thought of. I like the flavor.  7. Dessert, Coconut Ice *something* ANOTHER ORGASM!!!!! 8. Side Items .Grilled Asparagus, The best ASPARAGUS GRILLED EVER!!! It was $12 for 6 sticks of asparagus.   The service   This what makes me take off one star from Jean-Georges Steakhouse. The waiter did not take us seriously at first when we order 9 oz worth of Wagyu Beef.  The waitress wasn't that attentive with us.   In all, I will go back and spend my money here again , or should I say someone else's money ? In this case, it was the hotel.  Do I feel bad spending almost a grand? No. Am I spoiled? I do not think  so.",

The sushi appetizer for $24 consisted four small pieces of nigiri sushi.  This place would be okay if it were about 25% less expensive since the quality is poor.

The waitress was so careful with all the food she brought us, she checked several times to make sure everything was OK for my friend to eat.  That was a real relief, most times waiters and waitresses just say something is ok to eat, when actually it is not...this was NOT the case at Jean Georges- they truly cared to make sure my friend was ok. Our food was so good, OMG if I could eat there everyday(with an unlimited budget- and no getting fat concerns I would!) The Steak was SOOOOOOO good, my husband got the Tomahawk steak  and  it was YUMMMMMMMY! and IMMENSE! Enough food to last for lunch for the 2 of us for the next day. It was the finest steak I have ever had the honor of eating in my LIFE. I had the oysters and the short ribs. They were both so good, I am salivating as I write this. The SHORT RIBS are NOT TO BE MISSED! The wine stewart( or stewardness as she is a hot girl) was so thoughtful in our choices of wine, she paired things to our order perfectly.  She really knows her stuff. I forgot to mention the drinks from the bartender were so special and unique- like nothing else I have ever had...he really knows how to mix a Tasty yummy beautiful drink.( This is the classiest bar in Vegas) Oh Jean Georges, you are the very best!",

My friend ordered kobe steak graded A-5 meaning the best graded steak you can get in the states.

Jean Gorges' \"thing\" is the sauces. Your steak is served with five different sauces to choose from.   If you like a steak with its own flavor, this is not your steakhouse. If you like a steak with sauce, this is definitely your place to dine.   Plain mashed potatoes were quite poor. They were the consistency of paste and only tasted okay. Asparagus was delish.  Finally, I have to say that of the four steaks we ordered, not one came cooked to our specifications. The medium-wells were far too rare. The medium-rares were far too over-cooked. Hmm...  Would we visit here again? Maybe with a side of \"probably not.\"",

This is NOT your typical run of the mill steakhouse that serves the same old chops, mac n cheese, wedge salads, and shrimp cocktail. This is MUCH more! As you would expect, the steaks are fantastic. The kobe is to die for, but can put a major dent in the wallet. I suggest splitting a few ounces amongst the table for the experience alone, you can cut it with a spoon and it melts in your mouth. The accompanying sauces with the steaks are ridiculous. Sure a steak should speak for itself (and they certainly do here), but you are missing out if you haven't tried the soy-rice wine sauce. All in all, the food here exemplifies culinary mastery in terms of creativity, balance, depth, and quality choices of ingredients. From the oysters, to the hamachi, to the salads, to the steaks, to the dessert, you will not be let down. They also have a pretty impressive wine list. Eating here makes Mastros, Mortons, the Palm, and all your tired cookiecutter steakhouses look like a big waste of time, money and calories. However, if you are looking for a big waste of time, money and chicks who have had more than their fair share of calories, then go downstairs to ARIA's lackluster nightclub Haze.",

The seabass was perfectly cooked, but the seasoning was awful!!   The lamb was full of fat.  They give you 3 chops.  Left half of order just from fat and bones.  And made the mistake of ordering the miso sauce.... more salt.  Then made the mistake of ordering a baked potato... rubbed with more salt! ugh!!  While waiting for the meal, they give an assorted basket of bread... one which is pretzel bread... more salt.  Did not enjoy my server in training.  Didn't tell us about everything on the menu.  Then you get to listen to ALL the specials from all the new diners that get seated over and over and over and over.  That's how I found out my server forgot stuff.  Was the worst $210 I've spent.  Should have gambled it.",

    "text": "Pure Vegas: all the pizazz goes into the window dressing with far less substance beneath. A dazzling and luxe ambiance as to be expected but the space lacked intimate areas. As for the meal, the filet mignon was perfectly cut, seasoned and cooked. Wonderful. Though at $56 for an 8-oz. piece of beef (not even organic, mind you) one would expect side dishes to accompany. Not so. Cough up another $14 each for yummy truffled mashed potatoes or creamed spinach. The Caesar salad was the most uninspired I've ever had outside of an airport, with croutons that were clearly bulk packaged. A True embarrassment to the menu. The only redeeming factor was that the salad was cold - a nice counterpoint to the rest of my meal (and the only compliment I could come up with). Come for the beef, suck down a stiff cocktail, and enjoy the people show; otherwise you'll be left with the bitter taste of con in your mouth.",

They offer a slightly different experience than the old standards i.e. Ruth's Chris Morton's etc. The fresh baked breads are great, and they offer a variety of sauces that complement the meat. Chic decor also enhances the experience. Instead of an \"old boy club\" classic steak house feel, this place has a more modern motif which although a bit cold, I prefer.",

    "text": "My friend and I were about an hour late, but we were accommodated. The whole staff was friendly. We started with two flutes of champagne and a seafood platter that had oysters, clams, lobster, shrimp, and the biggest crab leg I've honestly ever seen. The three sauces that accompanied the seafood platter were all divine. We were served different types of breads with butter, a soft mini pretzel roll, spicy, large fancy cracker, and a chewy raisin type. I just couldn't get enough of these! The different textures were a delight. Then came the expensive bottle of  Riesling which i practically finished myself before the Entree was even ordered. I asked for the label. But, I guess they forgot. I regret this. It was the best Reisling I've ever had. I ordered the smallest portion of filet mignon and a side order of roasted bone marrow. I never would've thought that bone marrow would be that tasty. a woman stopped by the table and took some photos. It was then that I realized, I took too long noshing on bread and guzzling  sumptuous wine. I looked at that picture perfect, untouched filet mignon. I was full when it came time to dive into the magical creation that was the reason for coming. It ended up in a doggie bag. Shameful I know. I never got to try it. The pictures were nice. The prices I'm sure were way out of my economic league. I bet the bill would've been a car payment. But, thanks to my well-to-do friend, who $$$$splurged on me, I got to experience this epicurean adventure. Would I return. Doubtful. But, splendid experience.",

    "text": "Another home run from Jean-Georges! We had the most amazing dinner at our favorite Vegas steakhouse last night...we didn't think we could top the dinner we had there six months ago, but Joon and his team truly blew us away. From the exquisitely tender, flavorful, perfectly-cooked 18-oz ribeye; to the always-delicious, melt-in-your-mouth short rib; the satisfyingly crunchy yet creamy wedge salad; the sumptuous bread that comes before the meal...the list goes on. We were in seventh heaven. But unbeknownst to us, Joon and the team chose to plan some extra-special goodies for us that went far beyond anything we ever imagined. Each unexpected, surprise course they brought out for us was more magical than the last. From champagne the moment we sat down, to beef carpaccio that burst with flavor, to exquisitely high-quality sushi on crispy rice, bone marrow served on a mind-blowing platter with bone and all, and the piece-de-resistance, a dessert platter for our anniversary that included elegant little yummies galore, from NY cheesecake, chocolate lava cake, apple pie a la mode, to raspberry sorbet...to say we were wowed by all this is a vast understatement. And we were also really, really full. But it was a good, beyond-worth-it full!  Jean-Georges continues to be our absolute favorite fine-dining steakhouse in Vegas. From the service, the attention to detail, the pampering of their guests, and most importantly, their out-of-this-world food, we will come back again and again. A Vegas trip is incomplete for us without an evening at Jean-Georges. Thank you again, Joon and company! A True class act.",

I was lucky enough getting top notch dinners for free here at Jean Georges Steakhouse two nights in a row. I definitely can't complain about anything as the foods were simply superb and on top of it, it didn't cost me anything. Thank you my awesome business partners!   The first dinner, we had tons of food. We started with Nueske's bacon wrapped shrimps, calamari, and heirloom tomato and buffalo mozzarella salad. You may recall I hate overzealous servers who always boast everything they serve to be the best. This guy did exactly that. He told us it would be the best and lightest calamari we ever tasted. He also said the buffalo mozzarella was bar none and just the most incredible mozzarella ever. Surprisingly, he didn't lie. Holy shit, those calamari and mozzarella were amazing! AMAZING! I didn't mind him so much after I knew he was just telling the truth.   My filet was perfect, accompanied by half a lobster tail, creamed spinach, mushroom, truffle mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes. Everything was anything you could expect from Jean Georges Vongerichten.   The next day...though I was less enthused eating at the same exact place, I quickly forgot about it when I sat down and started drinking the house mule cocktail. Whoa! It was so strong and just pure alcohol but it was really good after several days of ass kicking meetings.   Now, I looked forward to the calamari and the bacon wrapped shrimps again. They also ordered the ahi tuna tartare that hit the spot for me. I started to get sick of red meat at this point and decided to share a bone in rib eye with our host. We had most of the same sides as last night plus truffle fries. Mind you.. This truffle fries weren't like any truffle fries you ever had with a douse of icky truffle oil. This one had shavings of real black truffle on top. The mushroom was also a favorite of mine. It was mixture of various kinds of mushroom sauteed with jalapeno so it had a little kick to it. I ate the peppers and it burned as it went down my throat. Yum!!  The rib eye and the filet were both premium for steak. They also offered a $270 6 oz of Kobe filet. Hahaha...insane!!   Both dinners were ultra pricy and I was just grateful that I could enjoy these gorgeous delicious food without breaking my bank. It was also great to spend quality times with people I work with every day.   Our server on the second night, Boris, was awesome. He was probably the best server ever and was on top of everything. He catered to our host so much and to all of us in the most courteous manner and at the end, after our host signed the whopping check and handed it to Boris, he shook our host's hand. It was so classy.  I will probably eat here again next year when in Vegas and I can't wait!!",

We were going to order from the extensive wine list but it seemed over-priced so we skipped it We started off with the bacon wrapped shrimp...excellent, then the wedge salad...blue cheese dressing was a little to spicy for me...spicy?...yes, spicy dressing. For our entree's, my wife got the filet...excellent, I got the ribeye...a little to fatty but excellent flavor. Mashed potatoes were perfect. They brought out several different sauces for us to try and I didn't like any of them but I don't usually use any sauce on my meat. All in all, a great restaurant, great service, just to expensive for what you got.",

However, if you're going to tell the world you're a premier steak house, you have to get the steak right. We ordered a filet rare, it came out medium. Another in our party ordered a NY Strip medium rare, it came out medium well. One ordered a NY Strip medium well, it came out rare. It was her birthday and she definitely prefers rare, we never send anything back, but we decided to let them know. The waiters response was \"Oh, ok, it looks pretty rare to me, but I'll send it back\". That was a bit of a let down on the service.   It was my biggest concern as so many others said the same, they can't get the steaks right. I sincerely loved the sauces, sides were great, some of the best presentations I've seen, but you've got to deliver on the main course. I'm stretching to a 3 on the review but was really on the line of a 2. Too many other great places in Vegas that can hit on levels.",

    "text": "Best steakhouse ever With a plethora of options in Las Vegas, it can be difficult to find a truly great steakhouse that will surpass all expectations. I have tried many steakhouses all over the US. My wife and I are big foodies, and being in the hospitality industry myself I tend to have high standards for for I would consider \"exceptional\". There are only a couple places I've ever been I would consider to have exceptional service, or exceptional food. Jean Georges has both. The first time I went here last year was for my birthday, and they didn't disappoint. I had done a lot of research and decided on Jean Georges, and was glad I did. Knowing that any place can get lucky once, I still had high expectations as I returned with my wife for our anniversary. Not only did they not disappoint, they far exceeded my already high expectations. We felt like royalty from start to finish. The GM came over to wish us a happy anniversary and check on us. He was kind and engaged enough to personally ask for allergies and on top of that, asked for my wife's dessert preferences.   Service: We had Ramon and Rachael for our servers, and both were amazing! extremely attentive, gave great recommendations, very knowledgeable about the menu, and truly cared about making our experience a great one. I can't say enough good things about them, thank you!!!   The Food and drinks: on their recommendation, I tried an Eagle bourbon on the rocks. Very good and smooth. My wife had a special, the belichi raspberry Bellini whisk she enjoyed. We had the tuna tartare to start, and it was very good. Not too big or filling, but tasted fresh and looked like it was made with care. For entrees, I had the bone in ribeye and my wife had the Chilean sea bass. I'm a big steak fan, so order steak a lot. This was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. It was so flavorful and had a perfect char on the perfect medium rare. To not only have the high end steak, but to have it cooked absolutely perfectly just made for a taste that's hard to imagine. The I tried my wife's Chilean sea bass as well, and we both agreed it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. You would think it was fresh off the boat, not eating it in the middle of a desert. If possible, the truffle Mac and cheese was just as good. The sauteed spinach and hand cut fries were good, and at a normal steakhouse I might say they were excellent, but here, in comparison to everything else, they were just fine. Not bad, but not exceptional. If I'm getting nit picky, I might recommend having a garlic or herb aioli, to go with them, or some type of parmesan truffle fry as a side, as opposed to just plain with ketchup. But again, they were cooked well and very good, just not as exceptional as the rest of the meal.   Dessert was made special by the chef for our anniversary and was just as good as the exceptional meal. We had the chocolate lava cake and Carmel apple pie with maple pecan and vanilla bean ice cream. It was incredible! I was already stuffed, but had to eat dessert just because it might have been one of the best desserts I've ever had.   Overall- 5 stars is not enough. No I don't work here, have no financial interest in this place. It just truly deserves an exceptional review for the exceptional place it is. Our experience was just incredible. Service, atmosphere, and food. Yes it is more on the expensive side, but it is well worth it. I live in Boston now, and we have some great steakhouses in Boston and NY, but nothing that compares to this (in my humble opinion). I would save up and fly back to Vegas just for this restaurant. Will definitely be returning. Thank you!!! Special thanks to the chef and GM. You truly helped make our anniversary a great one and exceeded our already high expectations!!",

Great steakhouse, very nice interior, good service and delicious food. first of all, the bread and butter they bring to the table is KILLER! OMG! I would go back for this 5 times a day if I could! Soft, warm bread that comes with soft, warm, herb butter! KILLERRRR!!! For apps, we ordered calamari and wagyu carpaccio. The calamari was cooked just right and very crunchy. It came with a side sauce which was like a spicy mayo. The Carpaccio was different because it was a thicker cut and different presentation with a yummy flavor. Not gamy at all. I personally ordered the 8 oz fillet with a blue cheese crust, cooked medium. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Soft and juicy and absolutely perfect! For the sides: mashed potatoes which was more like whipped potatoes. Very soft and creamy and perfect with my steak. DO NOT ORDER THE CREAMED SPINACH!!! Worst part of the meal! Flavorless and \"earthy.\" I gave my feedback to our waiter who was kind enough to remove the creamed spinach from our bill so that got a \"star\" back for the review. For dessert, we ordered the gold brick. Perfect amount of sweetness and not heavy. Nice combination of hazelnut and passion-fruit. I would definitely go back because I want to try the bone-marrow and a couple rounds of the bread and butter and steak. ENJOY!",

Per her rec, I got the 6oz Wagyu Filet Mignon which sounded small but it was more than enough along with bread, sides, dessert. I've visited 100s of nice steakhouses in my life and this Filet tasted different and extra juicy and delicious. The sides were solid. We pretty much ordered one of each. The Brussel sprouts were may fave. Dessert with apple pie was solid. Can't wait to try another entree next time.",

    "text": "Jean George's has been a favorite of mine ever since they came to Las Vegas. My wife and I have frequented on several occasions and I have to say we make it a point to visit JG's every time we come to Vegas. They absolutely excel at steaks! You will always find a good special if you want to really indulge. I had a 28 ounce Australian Waygu tomahawk (rare) and my wife had the Japanese A5 Kobe filet (the real Kobe). Just outstanding!   We just celebrated our anniversary here so we explored their new menu. They are always experimenting with something new based on our past experiences. We splurged and explored their new menu of which I've included some pictures.   I'd say the best way to describe this place is they take a classic twist on comfort foods. If you love good steaks and like 'em rare, well you will not leave this place disappointed!",

I've been to his restaurants in NYC and Miami Beach and you know what, Las Vegas didn't disappointed me as well. One of the best dining experiences in my life. To be honest, JG's restaurants are my #1, always.  Everything is just perfect from the very beginning to end. I'm a very picky person especially when it comes to my food taste and at JG's restaurants I find the best cuisine and service.  When my party and I arrived we've been nicely greeted at the door, confirmed our reservation, asked us if there were any allergies in our group. After that we've been escorted to the table. In literally 30 seconds our server touched our table, greeted us and offered some drinks. We've ordered a bottle of Merlot. That night we ordered the Pork Rib, Filet Mignon, Foie gras, 2 Wedge Salads and 1 Truffle Risotto. Oh boy was it delicious.  If I could give this (as well as JG's other restaurants) 100000* reviews trust me I would.  Always a fan of JG's food and exceptional service :)",

    "text": "I came to the Jean Georges Steakhouse for a group dinner hosted by some guys with whom my firm does a lot of business.  The menu had been preselected with one table-wide appetizer, and three to five choices of soup/salad, entree and dessert.  All of the choices appear on the regular menu.   The table started with the chilled seafood platter, with an awesome selection of oysters, shrimp, crab claws and crab legs. There were multiple cocktail and other sauces - I'm sure this appetizer cost a fortune, but it was truly extraordinary.   I chose the Burrata Mozzarella (salad), with tomato, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  The burrata could have used more salt but it was very fresh and really nice.  Not your average grocery store tomatoes, and good luck finding obviously handmade cheese like this - really nice dish.   How disappointing then that my medium rare NY Strip Steak was overcooked to at least medium - that shouldn't happen at a Jean Georges restaurant. No red, just a bit of pink in the middle.  The steak also tasted bland. I wasn't a big fan of the mushrooms either.  The mashed potatoes were awesome and probably had as much butter as they did potato.  My dessert confirmed the steak was an aberration.  The chocolate cake was ridiculous. Not too sweet but just bitter enough and perfectly melty on the inside with a rich ball of ice cream. Excellent.   Two comments on the service. While it was fantastic overall (they were cool when we lingered after closing time), it was annoying when the staff kept asking whether I was having flat or sparkling water, and then when one didn't ask somebody topped off my flat water with sparkling water - not cool. Then it was annoying when a photographer cajoled us into taking a souvenir photo of the table. Then she wanted $20 for each print.  Really guys?  At Jean Georges?  Overall the dinner was great, and special thanks go to our hosts. Great place.",

    "text": "Georgy, Georgy, Georgy .....  there are a lot of things that we loved and a lot of things we didn't. But I will say this - we were looking forward to this meal tonight. The casino host talked it up and said it was the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. But In the end we were disappointed.   First, the ambience. The place is classic and cool. It's dark and romantic and a little hip at the same time. It should be a bit more dressy but since this is Vegas the cargo shorts and t shirt crowd make it in too. The staff is superb. Friendly, timely and professional. The restaurant is clean and aside from the 80s hip hop music - which was not all that terrible - it's all really nice.   Second, the food. We kind of splurged. Since we had a losing day in the casino we thought a nice meal would make it all easier. We ordered the Kobe steak, the wagyu filet, the peppered Foie Gras, king crab and a side of sauteed mushrooms.    Kobe steak - we were excited to try this since we have never tried real Kobe beef before.  We expected a tender flavorful piece of meat but it was neither. It wasn't horrible but for $180 for 3 ozs we expected much more.    Wagyu filet - the waiter said this was their most popular steak.   It came out lukewarm so that took away from the taste.  We both thought it seemed like it sat out for awhile before it was brought out to the table.   Peppered foie Gras - we LOVE foie Gras. But this one wasn't that good either.  A bit too charred in some areas and again it was brought out after being out too long it seemed.  We have never had left over foie Gras but tonight, we didn't finish the foie Gras.   King crab legs - was good size with a lot of meat. The meat was sweet and good.    Mushrooms - a bit chewy but I think it is supposed to be that way.  Again, it was ok.   It was a $450 meal for two. So we didn't skimp.   But we have had much better meals.  Overall, we thought everything was just average and could use improvement.",

We happened to run into the general manager, Joon and we chatted with him for a bit as we sat at the bar. He recommended a few dishes that were a pleasant surprise including the crunchy sushi, pineapple tiger prawns and the black truffled pork. Great recommendations they were all superb, truly amazing.  I asked our bartender for a recommendation and he suggested the short rib. It was delicious. I started the meal with a Cakebread Chardonnay and finished it off with a Faust.  I came here planning on having a steak and was steered into trying a few new dishes that I probably wouldn't have ordered. I can't wait to come back and have them again.  After dinner at the bar we joined some friends who happened to be dining at a table. Their waiter over heard me talking about my dogs and offered two bones. They were the biggest bones I've ever seen. Even my dogs loved enjoyed Jean Georges!  Really happy with all aspects of our experience, highly recommended. I'll be back soon.",

The Filet Mignon was great along with the very unique side sauces that accompany it. The Brussels sprouts were delicious but they need to rethink the crunchy potatoes. A little bland for my buds.  This place is a definite for a date night. The atmosphere is a ten!! I will definitely be coming back.  Loved it!",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of dining here last week and sat with Jessica at the high tops in the bar area. Greeting us with a friendly smile, she maintained a level of professionalism throughout the entire service hat's hard to find at most restaurants. The room is sexy and dimly lit, but not completely dark where you have to pull out your phone flashlight to see the menu.  We started off with a few negronis and progressed onto wine afterwords. Jessica suggested the beef carpaccio and it definitely didn't disappoint as the aged balsamic completely balances out all of the flavors and cuts through the cheese. Their bread & butter service has to be the greatest in town-- a challah-type bread with French butter and herbs was TO DIE FOR. I had two by myself.   For the main course we ordered the poppyseed crusted salmon with root vegetables and the scallop dish with bok choy and potatoes. The dishes were presented beautifully and the kitchen does a extraordinary job of presenting an aesthetically gorgeous plate.   Of course there was room for dessert. The apple pie was recommended by Jessica, and it definitely didn't disappoint. There's the perfect balance of crust-to-filling ratio and the ice cream on top is well, the cherry on top of a perfect dinner. I highly suggest coming here if you're in the mood for a great night on the town with a meal you won't forget.",

We were greeted by very kind hosts for an early dinner. Ben and Roberto were our waiters and they were superb!!! Very attentive and genuine. Ben was able to give me recommendations about which steaks and what stood out for each one. I asked so many questions. I got the waygu filet and foie gras over it in the end.  It was amazing... seasoning was perfect for me. I want to taste the beef, not the crazy amount of seasoning or salt. It was great balance that really enhanced the steak. The foi gras was cooked excellent. It was fluffy in the center but perfectly seared outside. Very rich and full of flavor. Also, Ben taught me to order a rare plus which would be a cross of medium and rare. Perfect blend for me. I want the cow to still moo a bit. Dinner were brought out in very timely manner. Our drinks refilled quickly.   I also tried my friends Kobe beef which is their specialty steak. Rich, heavenly marbelized beef that was so succulent. Definitely recommend!!! Bone marrow was also very delicious and rich!!  Ben and Roberto made us very comfortable and never felt rushed. The 100K gold desserts with passion fruit and mixed fruit in the center was so great!! Must try!  Overall, I'd definitely recommend friends to this place for steaks and their service.",

I was really looking forward to the \"experience\" of such a fancy restaurant we don't get to eat at everyday. Plus as a vegas born local we can totally refer to many of our followers, especially since we now live in Texas and have many followers from there. But here's my personal experience. The hostess was nice , the waiters were nice , but the Sommeier I thought was sord of rude..made me feel like our party wasn't to his level. Our comp dinner included a wine pairing so I was expecting suggestions..he just basically came over and saw the reisling wine & modelo beer our guests ordered and didn't bother to care to give us his expertise. I somewhat know my wine , so he has no idea how much I was looking forward to his expertise , instead he brushed me off when I asked what wine goes best with my $135 porterhouse I just ordered. He was like, \"oh what you are drinking is good , the Malbec\" or Cabernet goes good \" that's it???? I could of gotten that suggestion from a wine & liquor store. Very disappointed with the experience because just because we were comped doesn't mean you treat us differently especially because we were comped for GIVING BACK to our local community. This dinner was also suppose to be a birthday celebration dinner. steaks were good , Carpaccio too small, Mac n cheese not impressive but mushrooms were good .  Sorry , wish I could give a better review but experience was ruined. ...",

Thankfully, Jean Georges does just that, differentiating themselves from the rest with some very unique dishes including :  Mishima Ranch Smoked Wagyu Brisket : Black Pepper Lacquer, Soy and Fermented Bean Sauce. Something you'd find from a standard BBQ joint, but with the BEST possible quality meat and elevated flavor p rofiles. It's mind opening! Brisket will never be the same again lol.  Bone Marrow served w/ Toast & Parsley Salad. Excellent marrow, rich and gelatenous, but the parsley salad cutting through and elevating to the next level! I've yet had a better version!  U4 Salt Water Prawns : Butter & Parsley. Largest prawns I've seen, resembling Lobster in texture and flavor. Awesome!  I could continue with each and every course, but I'll leave some to the imagination :)  Enjoy!!",

They told us that our reservation had been canceled and there was nothing they could do... Until we mentioned that we booked it through our friends Aria host and we were never informed of the cancellation. They quickly sat us after we mentioned that. We started off with two Bone marrow apps. They were impressive in size but very fatty compared to most bone marrow that I have tried. We each had filet or ribeye with a prawn. Prawn was way over cooked and steak was very bland and over cooked. The sides were okay. We had two lower priced bottles of wine and our bill was $1,000.00!!  The ambience was nice and the staff was great but the food was par. Not worth the bill. :(  I would eat at Bardot or Catch in the hotel before I went here again.",

    "text": "We had been looking to dine at this contemporary steak house located on the mezzanine level inside Aria for a while now and I finally made reservations on the night of the McGregor vs Mayweather circus, I mean fight. I thought that would be the perfect time to enjoy a nice steak dinner. While the rest of the town is focused on the fight, we will be enjoying our USDA Prime... We've been staying at City Center hotels steadily (once every 2-3 months) the last 3 years so this location is perfect for us.  We were seated immediately by the hostess upon arriving at a table in the main dining room. The restaurant didnt seem too busy at the time so it was curious why we were seated next to a table that was already occupied. The space was nice, modern, dimly lit and fit right in inside Aria IMO. Our waitress took our drink order then within a few minutes came back to take our food order. We started off with the gulf shrimp cocktail appetizer ($26) which came with cocktail sauce and lemon. They were big sized shrimp and tasted good & fresh. They were great with the lemon and cocktail sauce for dipping. We also ordered the tomato salad ($18) which came with hearts of palm and coconut. The tomato salad was plated beautifully and tasted pretty good. I just had a bite or 2... The complimentary bread loaf and whipped garlic butter provided at the table was very good. The loaf looked great and tasted even better. It was soft and buttery and the spread on it was perfectly matched.  For our entree, we ordered to share the 36oz prime porterhouse steak ($139) out of Greeley, CO. I like how they listed the source of each cut of steak. All the steaks at Jean Georges are cooked over apricott wood and finished with rendered beef fat, sea salt & cracked pepper. The porterhouse was delicious. It was cooked to a perfect medium. Just a nice pink at the center. I really enjoyed this steak and would order it again without hesitation. It was perfect for sharing between 2 people.  For our sides we went with the trumpet mushrooms ($18) and lobster mashed potatoes ($20). The mushrooms were great as they were cooked  in garlic, jalapeno and lemon. It was a great addition to our steak dinner. The lobster mash was good too. There were big lobster pieces in it and was a rich, creamy mash.   Overall, a great dinner at Jean Georges. Nice, quiet atmosphere, good friendly service and delicious chophouse fare. I recommend it if you are around the City Center. We were staying at Vdara so it was perfect.",

    "text": "A Vegas trip is never quite complete unless it involves a visit to one of the city's premiere steakhouses.  This time around, we found our way to the newest kid on the block:  Jean Georges Steakhouse (conveniently located inside the Aria hotel where we happened to be staying at the time).  First, I must comment on the beautiful and stylish decor  inside the restaurant.  The design was immaculate and very chic ... right down to the \"island sinks\" inside the bathroom.  Service was on point including our friendly and very knowledgeable waitress.  As for the food, well, we started out with the grilled foie gras terrine (what a surprise right? I'm almost positive that I'm addicted to this stuff).  Grilled / terrine? Doesn't quite make sense right? Apparently, thanks to our waitress, the foie is at first grilled then prepared in terrine form - so don't expect it to be seared.  I still am not 100% convinced that I truly liked this preparation - I've certainly had better ... but it certainly was not bad by anyone's standard.  As for the main course, my girlfriend and I decided to split the 28oz bone in rib-eye.  As much as I wanted to like it ... I found the meat a bit uneven when it came to its flavor.  It was at times a bit too salty depending on which area of the steak I was eating ... perhaps this is not unusual ... but this is certainly the first time I've taken notice.  For the sides, we had the truffled mash potatoes and the grilled bone marrow.  The truffled mash was excellent ... one of the best, if not thee best,  preparation of this dish I've ever had.  You can certainly taste the truffle flavor all over this excellent dish.  As for the bone marrow, well, it is INSANE!!!  Never have I had a side dish that consisted of this much bone marrow grilled to perfection.  I actually physically felt my cholesterol jump a few hundred points as I delicately scooped the marrow into my mouth.  It accompanied the rib-eye perfectly along with the gremolata that it was served with. Be warned that this is a huge portion ... so please don't forget to prophylax yourself with your cholesterol lowering drug of choice (mine would be Lipitor). Fearing a massive coronary ... we opted not to have dessert.  Overall, I would give Jean Georges a 3.5 stars - the decor, ambience and service would definitely be a 4-4.5 stars.  As great as the side dishes were, I felt that the ribe-eye wasn't quite up to par (especially compared to the side dishes) and therefore I would have to rate it a 3. Harsh, I realize, but then again this is the land of Carnevino, Cut, SW steakhouse, Craftsteak, Delmonico, Smith & Wollensky among others.  With that much competition within a 10mile radius ... 3 stars is actually not that bad. As great as the setting, ambience and service were ...  in the end,  I felt that Jean Georges, dare I say it, failed to deliver.",

This is a very nice dining room that has music piped in that might be appropraite in the bar in front, but not in the dining room.  It then causes the guests to have to raise their voices over the music to be able to cave a conversation at their table, all of it making for a very noisy dining room.  The manager and the waitress agreed, said that they hear the compaints all the time, but were told by senior management that they can not change the volume of the music.   Two stars because sometimes the owners need to listen the the patrons even if they have a \"vision\" of what it should be.",

Perfectly cooked over a wood burning grill. We also had grilled asparagus, creamed corn and sauted mushrooms. For appetizers we had their secret menu grilled oysters( the bomb)! Sashimi sampler was delicious and a fruit salad that was out of bounds! Chef Griffin gave us a complimentary bday dessert with Carmel ice cream topped with Carmel popcorn. What a treat! I gotta give this place 5 stars. This was the best fine dining experience my wife and j have ever had and we've had many fine dining experiences! Thumbs up for former chef of Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio. We will be coming back for our anniversary:)",

We arrived to Jean Georges expecting a fine dining experience and we're seated at a booth table. Our table was wobbly and had to be adjusted while we were seated there. Rather than moving us to another table and deeming that one off limits for the evening to fix later. We were handed a menu that was selected for our package. The selection was terrible. My caesar salad was horrible!! Not at all what I expected. The portion was minimal and it did not look pleasing. I ordered the filet mignon. Apparently  everything is a la carte. No vegetables or sides. Dessert was decent. All in all, the experience was terrible. For what you pay, you would expect more. The wine selection was terrible. We ordered a glass of merlot each and only had one merlot to choose from. I would never recommend this place. For the amount of money that each individual pays to eat there, they should be able to get decent tables. I understand a dimly lit restaurant for ambiance. The ladies room? The toilet was black too. Could barely see yourself in the mirror to put on your lipstick. Would never recommend.",

Prices are a bit outrageous and the sides are very small.  The spinach salad was a total pass as it was too drenched in the lackluster dressing.  The port belly eggs rolls dripped with grease, were very tasty but not worth what they charge.  Just go for the steak.",

    "text": "Decided I would try a steakhouse in Vegas that I have not tried before, so I ended up at Jean Georges at the Aria.  I've dined at a Jean Georges restaurant in London, so my expectations were high.  My experience at Jean Georges Steakhouse was... meh.  I don't really have anything bad to say about Jean Georges.  The experience should be one that wows me at their price point, but sadly Jean Georges didn't wow.  First up was a sushi sampler.  Extremely small, tasty morsels of three types of fish on a deep fried rice cake with a spicy mayo.  Not bad, fish slices could have been more generous, but not wow.  Some soy sauce with that maybe?  The main was the Australian NY Steak.  It comes with four sauces; a house made habanero butter sauce, a soy miso sauce, a flat bernaise sauce and some ketchupy kinda thing.  Can you tell how I felt about the last two sauces?  There was also a bone marrow shaped container of a salsa verde that was very nice.  Did I really need five sauces with the steak?  Nothing offensive about it, just sometimes less is more maybe?  The mashed potatoes were quite buttery, very nice.  First cocktail came with a dirty glass, but that was immediately remedied when pointed out.  The service was fine.  The decor felt very New York.    So there it is, my meh dining experience at the very pricey Jean Georges Steakhouse.",

    "text": "What a Complete DISAPPOINTMENT !! We've been to quite a few high end steak houses and pretty much know what to expect when they say good meat. The food was definitely below average.... actually to be blunt the filet mignon's were terrible. Nothing we've had or would expect. Side dishes were a joke... Side dishes are small to begin with but their's was funny. No wonder the waiter told us that it would be best to probably order a \"few\" of each side order.. A \"few\" of each side order ??? Really.. But we understood why when we got them. It looked like the toys my 5 year old plays with in her miniature kitchen. The taste on the side orders and the appetizers were NOTHING to brag about. Baked potato soaked in salt and this is supposed to be gourmet.. Overall the food was a complete disappointment, service lacked horribly and the interior was nothing impressive either. After experiencing the food and ambiance of the SW at Wynn, Jean Georges is miles away. There were 8 of us and we couldn't wait to leave the place. Oh, they were more expensive on every single dish than most of the really high end steak houses !! It's ok to charge, but you must deliver accordingly.",

    "text": "I would give this place 5 stars, but I only tried a couple of dishes. That being said, everything was perfectly done.  The decor is novel yet stately, with a cute graphic of a cow's nose emblazoned all around, and the bar has a really cool vibe.  Bf and I arrived on thier second day of being open, in very casual clothing (think hoodies and jeans) and were told that there were no tables available (entirely booked, completely understandable), but we asked if we could get food at the bar, and the friendly hostesses said we could get the full menu there, so we went for it.  We were the only people in the restaurant in casual clothes (we looked really out of place) but the bartender treated us just as well as the businessmen in Armani suits. Our bartender was friendly and professional, and carried on just the right amount of conversation with us. It may have helped that we're locals who work in the industry, but my instinct is that the service is just very good. They had three beers on tap, Boddington's was one of them, I believe, but I was very thrilled to see that Delerium Tremens was also on tap (an exquisite beer from Belgium) so ordered a glass. Our bartender provided us with small dishes of cashews and buttery rosemary popcorn with fluer de sel on the side to munch on, a great touch. A server also brought around a basket of home-made breads, all of which were good, but the brioche made my day!  We split the roasted sweetbreads with chestnuts ($22) from the appetizer section, it came out presented nicely and had an intoxicating aroma, but was a very small portion (as can be expected). It was my boyfriend's first time trying sweetbreads, and he was pleasantly suprised by how good they were. The dish was small, but nicely executed, crisp on the outside, tender inside, buttery, nutty, with some shaved black truffles and either a bit of potato, or more probably some fresh water chestnut to play off of the other components.  We ordered a carmelized banana cake off of the dessert menu (I think $14 but I could be wrong) and it was sublime. The light, fluffy cake was topped with thinly sliced, carmelized bananas, and came with a quenelle of caramel ice cream (my mouth is watering thinking back to it), a tuille cookie, and something crunchy and addictive underneath (I think it was chocolate flavored puffed rice, but I could be wrong) bf practically licked the plate.  For an appetizer, dessert, and two beers it was about $59 but I felt it was worth it.  I can't wait to go back and try some steaks!",

My husband ordered a surf and turf, the entry itself cost more than $100 and it came with the lobster way overcooked (they overbaked it).  I ordered a organic chicken, but it came dry and oily.  Mash potato was the best and let me tell you the secret, lots of butter in it.  On top of everything, I ordered two glasses of Pinot for $18 each. On the final bill, I saw a charge of wine for $30 each.  When I inquired, the waiter brought me a wine list which was totally different from the glass wine menu we were presented at the time of ordering.  He turned to the glassed wine page in a very snobbish way.  True, what I ordered was not on the menu.  So I told him the menu I ordered from was a different one.  Minutes later, he came back with the bar menu (I guess) and said casually that the one I ordered was no longer available so he replaced with the more expensive one but he would charge me only $18/glass,  Oh, what a favor he did me!!!  For the price one pays, the quality of food and service is really unacceptable.",

    "text": "First off, world, there are so many people with nut allergies out there - why would you serve bread with nuts without saying something about it?! Especially when it has  GROUND walnuts that were not visible nor tasted by anyone in the group! No wonder our friend had a near anaphylactic reaction! Luckily her allergy is not extremely severe or there would be a major problem going on. She did not want a commotion to be made, so I discretely went to the hostess to ask what is in the bread - since all servers were no where to be found. She informed me that it was walnuts and that someone should have told us. Since we were dressed up my friend did not have her EpiPen on her so I asked where the nearest medical station was to get some Benadryl (everyone in our group is in the medical profession so we felt comfortable not calling an ambulance). She got hasty with me and said \"Probably the CVS down the street\" - HELLO! You have a medical situation going on - I'm fairly certain the Aria has a medic or at least your restaurant has access to some Benadryl! I checked back in with my group before going on a mile long adventure and my friend told me she would be OK as long as we were all mindful of her situation. The manager never came out to see how she was doing, no one checked in on us until the end when the server said \"Probably should have told you about the nuts, huh?\" That's it.   The service was majorly lacking. We felt that because we are quite young (early twenties) we were of last priority, apparently our money was not as good as the older couples in the restaurant. At every high end restaurant we have ever been to (and many day-to-day 'regular' restaurants) allergies are of high concern and we have been asked by nearly every server prior to the beginning of the meal. My friend is very aware of her allergy and waits until her husband tries breads or other high concern foods before she does. It passed all of our \"sniff tests\" because it was hidden with other flavors and was ground. Not excusable. Where in the world was management - clearly the server knew that he didn't say anything about the nuts and the hostess knew we weren't told of it. My friend was not comped even in the slightest. Unheard of.  The rest of the meal was uneventful, food was great. We did the prix fixe meal and was quite good. We were all happy with the rest of our food, despite our general feeling about the restaurant itself.",

It certainly wasn't bad but it didn't leave me \"licking the plate\" and saying \"Oh my God, this is outstanding!\". Something I WAS expecting to do after forking out $360 for 3 people - no wine, no dessert and no starters. Seriously, there is much better for a lot less on the Strip.

When times get rough And friends just can't be found, Like a bridge over troubled water at...JEAN GEORGES STEAKHOUSE! - Tessanne Chin (bridge over troubled water cover)  This restaurant wins the award for the most exceedingly surprising meal of the year as I saved this for my last review of 2013! The average yelp rating does not do this place justice and based on my overall experience with their service + signature tasting menu, I ended my recent Vegas trip on a very high resounding 'pitch perfect' note!  Signature tasting menu: 1. caviar w/ creme fraiche and lemon gelee (the lemon gelee was more for decoration but the caviar and creme fraiche tasted good together) 2. tomato salad (many components to this dish - large tomato with smaller heirloom tomatoes + avocado + other things i can't remember, wish i took a picture but components were lovely, very good flavors) 3. scallops (wished i had more, no complaints) 4. soy glazed short rib (probably the star of the meal, came with an apple hash that went amazing with the short ribs, which by the way were mouth-watering tender) 5. wagyu filet (brussels sprouts which reminded me of kale - four different dipping sauces that were fun although the flavor of the steak was great on its own, cooked medium rare plus) 6. chocolate mousse w/ mint gelato (mint flavor was not overpowering and i loved the chocolate candy dots on top, added a fun crunch)  A common theme throughout each course is that there are many well thought out components to each dish. Sometimes simple is better but when the elements taste so harmoniously together, it's hard to complain. Also the turnover time between courses was impressive and on point. One of the truly satisfying and complete tasting menus that I've experienced in Vegas (which is quite a brick ton) and would highly recommend for your current/next visit!  Counting down to 2014: 9 - Nine o'clock and kitchen was still open! 8 - the number of meals (including late nights) I had on this recent trip 7 - the number of meals I wished I had (earl's sandwich at 3 am is a scary line lol) 6 - the amount of courses in the tasting menu 5 - five stars for service without a doubt 4 - for sure it was a memorable time 3 - three winter nights (including ice skating fun!) culminating in this final meal 2 - two people who left with big smiles on their faces 1 - one month until I'll be back 0 - zero reasons not to come to Jean Georges Steakhouse!  Happy New Years fellow yelpers!!! #readyfor2014",

    "text": "I love Jean Georges!  This is one of our favorite Steakhouses in Vegas.  It's chic, the service is outstanding, and the food is awesome.  When we lived in Vegas, we dined here several times with friends, clients, and associates.  Since we moved away, we've dined here a couple of times and it's still one of the best.  On our most recent visit, we ordered:  Shrimp Cocktail, $24 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=SB9fjtPMZe1uSfIkrWDAsw#SB9fjtPMZe1uSfIkrWDAsw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jean...</a>  Wedge Salad, $18 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=ParoKhwPVYkS75fYHbs0_A#ParoKhwPVYkS75fYHbs0_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jean...</a>  8 oz Filet, $56 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=wyuSSo6SyEj_E0lkMaIvYA#wyuSSo6SyEj_E0lkMaIvYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jean...</a>  Rack of Lamb, $54 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=y3z9DxKeC2ym8wMsTgao4g#y3z9DxKeC2ym8wMsTgao4g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jean...</a>  Black Truffle Mac n Cheese, $18 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jean-georges-steakhouse-las-vegas?select=arVyfuaH2n5we4Ny-HF4vQ#arVyfuaH2n5we4Ny-HF4vQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/jean...</a>  The Wedge Salad was a perfectly sized portion and full of flavor.  The Iceberg Lettuce was crisp and juicy....the thick slices of Bacon added a ton of flavor to it....yum!  The Better Half enjoyed the Shrimp Cocktail.  She almost got full off the Jumbo Shrimp.  I had the Filet, which was heavenly.  Juicy, charred just right, and full of flavor.  It comes with a choice of sauce and I always get the JG Steak Sauce.  The sauce compliments the Steak and doesn't overwhelm the natural flavor of the Beef.  The Black Truffle Mac n Cheese is spectacular as well.  Very rich and creamy.  The prices at this joint are not for the budget-minded diner.  Don't fool yourself....if you don't want to spend the money, don't dine here...you'll be disappointed.  However, if you want a great meal in a chic restaurant with awesome service, then this place is for you.  Return Factor - 100%",

From the outside looking in, I was somewhat impressed.  The host/hostess at the front desk didn't seem too thrilled to be working there.  We got seated and I must say, it was pretty dark in there.  Our party ordered a mix of things from black truffle mac and cheese, foie gras, creamed kale, bone in rib eye, to the filet mignon. black truffle mac and cheese - I've had better out of a box foie gras - was very good creamed kale - way too creamy, couldn't taste the kale bone in rib eye - asked for it medium rare, it came out medium.  the steak wasn't seared, but more like burnt.  Couldn't really tell because the dining area was so dark, but my movement showed otherwise. filet mignon - surprisingly tasted really good after trying the bone in.    Would I go back?  Not likely.",

    "text": "Been to lots of steakhouses - in Vegas, in Bay Area, in So. Cal, in Toronto, but this one by far was my least favorite.  Ambience- very dark and loud, like you're eating dinner in the middle of a club.  Service- just okay, nothing exceptional, once I declined wine list I was never offered any other type of beverage. So what if I'm not a big wine drinker? I could've easily ordered 10 cocktails instead!  Food- also just okay. Steak was cooked to order, but served lukewarm. Also served with multiple sauces. Sauces for my steak? Really? Isn't the flavor of the steak supposed to be amazing enough on its own that it wouldn't need a sauce? Well one of the 4 sauces was tasty, the other 3 just had no place being on the table. Asparagus was flimsy, no snap or crunch.  Definitely, not what I expected for how much I spent. I will say though that the brioche bread served in the beginning was very delicious, and the guy that kept refilling my water (cause that was the only drink offered) was on point! Water glass was never half empty. So for those two reasons, I give the 2 stars.  I'm just disappointed because a few friends recommended this place, but it wasn't at all what I had hoped it would be. I'll be trying Aria's other restaurants instead next time I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "This visit turned into a 5 Star experience but it didn't start out that way. We had early reservations and I arrived 4 minutes before they opened. The hostess was not very pleasant or friendly and stated quite clearly they were not open yet. I apologized for being 4 minutes early and I thought I had made a complete mistake coming here. Well....I was wrong.  Jean George is tucked away in the Promenade level of the Aria hotel and even though I have been a guest at Aria for years, never noticed it. It is beautiful with a bar at the entrance and elegant seating within the restaurant.   We ordered a bottle of wine from their very professional and knowledgeable Sommeliere, Jason. Our server was Jack and he treated up like VIP's. He knew everything there was to know about the restaurant and dishes he served. Jack (a different one) the GM of the restaurant also checked in with us which was a nice touch. Since we were so early we ordered from the \"Early Evening\" menu which is $69 + tax and tip. It includes a starter, main and dessert. Well worth it if you are able to dine between 5-7pm. You can also add anything A La Carte from the main menu. From the early menu I ordered the Caesar salad (good), filet mignon (one of the best I have ever had) and the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream (so good). I had to order the Truffle Mac & Cheese from the regular menu. It was not as hot as I would have liked but was awesome.  Every moment here was 5 Stars, so I had to overlook the initial non-welcome I received from the Hostesses.   If you are looking for a fine steak house in Las Vegas-you will do yourself a favor by dining here. Just don't arrive 4 minutes before the restaurant opens!",

We split the Wedge salad to start along with the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. Both outstanding! We will get the Bacon Shrimp again. For entrees, we both got the King Crab legs entree which were chilled. My uncle also got the Grilled Maine Lobster, which he shared a little with me. Both were superb! We both had steak the night before which is why we got seafood. For sides, we ordered the sauteed spinach and truffle mash potatoes. Both were good, but I think we will try new sides next time.  The only comment I have on the seafood was there was no bowl or spare plate for the crab and lobster shells. Please consider adding these so we have more room on our plates!  Overall, we had an outstanding experience. 5 stars and we will be back. Cocktails and service were both exceptional as well! Thank you JG for a wonderful dining experience!",

The dining room is adequate, but the bar is more lively and magnetic and suits the atmosphere of the restaurant more. We had bacon enrobed shrimp with a spicy peach chutney (winner), beef carpaccio (winner) and a palm heart salad which was different but addictive nonetheless.  The New York strip had a nice char and flavor on it, but I found the accompanying sauces unnecessary.  Possibly only serve them on request since purist meat eaters like their steak unadorned.  I found the flavor and tenderness of the New York strip  won over the dray aged version I had prior. Once again I had the mac n cheese...cheese bomb delicious! A decent cocktail list was present but I always find these creative cocktails to be too sweet so we passed. Trust me, you want a seat at the bar!",

I could have saved $40 and cooked this at home. Nothing special especially for the price. My organic chicken was extremely dry and I had to send it back.  It's been 20 minutes and my food has still not arrived and my boyfriend is already done with his meal.   I will say the pork BBQ ribs was good but the appetizer does it make it worth coming here.     Service was great though. Very attentive and they were genuinely concerned about the chicken not being to me liking.  I want to update this review.  The manager of the restaurant came over a personally apologized.  The second organic chicken they sent was delicious.  Crispy and juicy.  They ended up comping  our meal due to the time it took for my dish and even sent over desert and drinks. I am very impressed at the way they handled this situation and the manager gave us his card and told us to email him the next time we come in.    I'm impressed by the service and would try it again.    Bravo to the service",

Especially if your name is at the door. 2 things come with my personal expectations, especially when we talk about world renowned chefs, quality and service. Decor and all the other stuff is second to what's important, the food and the delivery.   The server was rushed and took very long to come back to the table, it was a nice touch to know that someone else noted and came to rescue this party, but then the service died down. He didn't know the wines on the list, he didn't know the menu that well, and overall things just snowballed to a bad evening.   The Bread & Butter was hard and cold, now you can say what ever you want about my over the top scrutiny when it comes to this review, but I'm not about to let that hard butter and cold bread slide by, I mean come on, if I'm coming to eat my carbs at least give me proper bread service. I'm not even going to get in to the details about the bread being stale, but by French standards the baker should shoot the person who dared put out that sorry excuse of bread.   It's been 1 hour and appetizers are nowhere to be found, my cocktail was empty, I'm sitting playing with the ice, and wondering if anyone has a clue.  The salads were outstanding, I think that was the highlight of the meal, the oysters were nice, the would have been better if the abductor muscle was released and I didn't have to fight to eat them.   3 words.....Over cooked steak!!!!!!!!!!!! In a steak house, twice, the chef should be shot ! And hung ! Like in France, the manager had the audacity to argue with me, my steak was well beyond medium (we ordered medium rare)....the sides ? Meh !   The meal was...... Meh for a 2 hour sitdown  One would assume that they could do better, 2 servers one assistant and a manager, I was far from impressed and honestly I was very upset about, all I wanted was some steak, oysters and salad.

Both our filets had fatty stripes...The wine selection was good and the sides were good... Lobster was good... But yet again very disappointed with the filet mignon! It's a steak house!",

The A5 Kobe is probably one of the best steaks I have ever had ( 55 dollars an ounce ). Sides are great as well. Two issues to consider before dining. The service is a little slow and very very expensive. Other then that I would say this is a good choice for a steakhouse in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner in December 2016 to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Made reservations but because it was a weekday, could've done without one. Super classy decor which is fitting with the Aria look. Our server Ramon was warm and accommodating as he explained the dishes to us.  For apps, we ordered Wagyu Carpaccio and Tomato Salad with Hearts of Palm and Coconut. The Tomato Salad was just alright, but the Wagyu Carpaccio was outstanding. Melt in your mouth texture. The truffle combined with the sauce just completed the entire flavor experience. Highly recommend!  Next up we got 12 oz NY Strip and the Soy Glazed Shortrib with Granny Apple & Jalapeno.   For the NY strip, we were provided five steak sauces to enhance the flavor of the meat. Gave them all a try and each had its unique taste! My fave was the soy miso butter sauce. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium - one of the best I've ever had!  Now for the short rib - it was absolutely amazing as well. It sucks that it got a bit cold as I spent too long devouring each bite, but regardless it was great. Super tender (slow roasted forever it seems) and it came with an apple salad that was quite refreshing and nicely balanced the spices in the dish. No wonder this dish won some award recently (Dish For Fall - Soy Glazed Short Rib, 2016 Dining Awards (2016) - Vegas Seven).  For dessert we got the molten lava cake (which was apparently invented by Jean-Georges). The cake was okay but the ice cream was bomb.   Overall it was worth every dollar given the variety of courses we tried and the quality of food and service. I would definitely come back and look forward to trying other Jean-Georges restaurants in different cities! Thanks to Ramon and team for making our dinner one to remember.",

    "text": "A beautiful restaurant, initially striking the right balance in atmosphere, neither stuffy steakhouse nor nightclub party with a side of meat, Jean George's is a prime example of unrealized potential. The night was full of slight missteps.  For example, over half of the seats at the bar were marked as \"reserved\"- resulting in those waiting for their tables not being able to have a cocktail without sitting on the couches in the \"lounge\" (with nowhere to sit your drinks).   We brought our own wine, but it took awhile before the sommelier asked if we'd like it opened and decanted. Small thing.  We were very excited about the menu, because there were some really delicious offerings, and the accompaniments- wow! This definitely could be the start of an amazing marriage of surf and turf!  Appetizers started off pretty well. The crab cake took the prize- the marriage between the sweet citrus, the avocado, the crab- light, sweet, and close to perfect. The bacon wrapped shrimp, while good, didn't \"wow\" me. This time, the old adage \"everything's better with bacon\" didn't quite hold True.  Now, the meat!! Prime ribeye, medium (being sure to clarify that it would be a warm, red center), and Australian filet,  medium plus , were on the docket. I also ordered the scallop accompaniment and the lobster mashed potatoes.  Let's start with the positive.. The scallops were pretty close to perfect. Three meaty, tender, and large scallops arrived with my steak. Delicious. However, the steak itself was pretty average. The center was closer to pink than red, and while seasoned nicely, the steak itself was not very tender. I remember remarking that I'd made better steaks at home on my cast iron skillet. Not bad, but certainly fell short of expectations.  The filet was even worse- a significant portion of it was gristle, hard to cut into and almost impossible to eat. This one was cooked medium rather than medium plus with the red, warm center, and was also seasoned well, but when 1/2-2/3 of it is inedible... Yeah.  The lobster mashed potatoes were tasty, but save for one large chunk, there wasn't much actual lobster in there, although it did have good lobster flavor. Are you sensing a trend here?   Ok, maybe dessert will salvage things! The server spoke very highly about the apple pie, and that was the only thing that interested me, so why not!  Again.. Just ok. Nothing to write home over, but not bad.   So, all in all... Just an okay experience here. Pity too.. Lots of potential, but execution was lacking.",

We actually had a desert tray, as it was a special occasion (birthday), so I'm not sure if this was on the menu, but I can tell you everything on that tray was mouthwatering. Don't go there if you're counting penny, go and enjoy a little piece of heaven. Kudos to the staff, and especially the Manager Jerry Rodriguez. I have definitely put this on my list of to do again.

The Kobe was everything I expected it would be and maybe 70% more.  Cooked to perfection. Other than the Kobe, the appetizers were flawless as was the wine and dessert.  This was easily the best dining experience my friend and I have ever had. We were in the restaurant approximately three delightful hours.     Special recognition to our waiter Jack Jenkins who served us and recommended the appetizers, wine, dessert and how the Kobe should be prepared.   He orchestrated our dinner from start to finish. Jack is the consummate dining professional.   I live in San Francisco and even though Kobe is  available here, I have every intention of flying back to Las Vegas and  revisiting Jean Georges and Mr Jenkins within the next year for what I am sure will be a repeat of a pure  gastronomic delight.",

I originally had reservations at Prime in Bellagio, which I know is great, but while strolling through Aria saw Jean Georges and figured I'd try it.  Mistake!  Firstly, let me say the service was excellent. No complaints there. We ordered the Wagyu Tomahawk, which was supposed to feed 3.  It was about a $240 steak. When they brought it to the table and cut it tableside, there were literally 3 slices of edible steak and the rest was pure fat (not marbled meat). We called the manager over, who was very nice and he agreed and ordered us two more steaks of our choice. We ordered a filet and a strip.  These came out and they were tasteless. They were not rested and apparently cooked cold.   Again, we called the manager over a decade explained the situation and again, he was nice and poured us a complementary scotch.   Bottom line, the meal was sub par and all we wanted was a great steak. I think that they should have comped the whole meal under the circumstances.",

Sides we got were: truffle mac n cheese (yum), spinach  (bland), creamed corn (very very yum) lobster mashed potatoes  (ehhh not too great) caesar salad (booo) all of which were extremely small and overpriced for what you get.

I think it's because there were so many conventions in town that it was just too busy everywhere and maybe workers were stressed and didn't know how to handle busy times. Who knows.   Coming here was such a great ending to our weekend.  The service was phenomenal. We made same day reservations about 4 hours ahead of time. We were greeted kindly when we walked in and also seated right away. I ordered the salmon and it was cooked perfectly. My husband's ribeye was also cooked perfectly.  The shoyu butter sauce was amazing!  Goes great with steak.  I think our server's name was Jum. He made the dinner run smoothly and was extremely friendly and knowledgable about anything we asked. He recommended the truffle Mac and cheese which was also exceptionally delicious!  I would definitely come back again.",

    "text": "I thought I'd written a review for here long ago.  Having a business dinner with my husband's clients, he decided Jean Georges Steakhouse in Aria would be the locale. Having eaten there twice previously, I was pleased it was here due to the positive food experience.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Wednesday and stood by the bar, cocktails ordered and in hand, awaiting for the last couple to join our party. Once arrived we were seated in the back room formally called the Board Room.  Our server and two additional servers arrive, more cocktails and wine is ordered, appetizer orders placed. We ordered a variable bevy of appetizers from the menu, a mixture of cold and hot. A couple iced towers of raw seafood, giant prawns, mussels, crab legs, very firm and delicious. A couple platters of sushi and calamari and then a couple salads (I ordered a Caesar with avocado- not bad, but the dressing was quite bland and extremely creamy).  Loads of different meals ordered, I had the ginger-miso sea bass which was huge in size and flavor, quite scrumptious. My husband ordered the rib eye steak and a side of asparagus. He commented it was good. Our dinner mates ordered the same rib eye, but someone else ordered Kobe streak, salmon, wagyu carpaccio, and I believe someone just got a salad with salmon. Other sides were the Mac n cheese which I personally didn't try, but it was noted as good, creamed spinach (yuck), French fries, Brussel sprouts, and baked potato.  Desserts were fine, nothing striking. We ordered the apple pie skillet( dry and not very tantalizing), chocolate lava cake (tiny, also dry and a bit bland and boring), a couple scoops cherry sorbet and a yummy cranberry sorbet, the best thing (and I don't really love sweets) was the vanilla ice cream with hot fudge poured over.  Service in my opinion was attentive and fast, although one person commented the server should have known more about the different cuts of meat. Boo boo.  Ambience is very dark, sleek and sexy, would be good for date night or trying to impress clients.  Dinner for 10 people, plus a couple bottles of wine, a few cocktails and 4 glasses of grappa (like a foul smelling, foul tasting grape lighter fluid digestif), was I believe about $1600, tip included. Common price for an establishment such as Jean Georges.  Would return.",

Atmosphere: Mood is EVERYTHING here. Dark, gorgeous, and sexy. Perfect especially for a date night. Electronic chill music leaves things low key and calm while also keeping the energy flowing.  Customer Service: World class from start to finish and probably what sets JG apart from other steakhouses I've dined at on the strip. With sincerity, the customer service here surpasses many Michelin star restaurants I've visited. Hostesses are warm, food servers are friendly and genuine, and managers with a calm presence graciously came by to check on us during our meal. Every dish was explained along the way.   Food: Bread- Four options with a salted butter. Perfect for those like me who revel in the bread basket just as much as they do the actual dishes.  Caesar salad- the kitchen split our salad for us, and it was plenty to share between two as a starter. Nice lemony touch and chopped to small bites, which is much appreciated.   Bone marrow- the GM generously shared a few bonuses with us, to include this one. Presentation has a solid \"wow\" factor! Of note: bone marrow portion itself is quite small and enough to enjoy on two pieces of toast with a very tasty, vibrant gremolata.  Steak- NY strip was cooked to perfection and served with several sauces, which were all explained by the great staff.  Sides- We had the creamed kale, truffle mac and cheese, and asparagus. Absolutely LOVED the creamed kale and asparagus. Truffle mac and cheese was enjoyable but less exciting than I imagined it to be. Be careful when ordering the first two though- they were pretty heavy on the salt.  Dessert- We had the cheesecake and chocolate cake! Beautiful presentations with multiple creative components. Best when paired with a coffee. :)   Dining on the strip tends to be inflated, but when you are deciding on where to eat, I can suggest JG as a cut above the rest because of the service; while the food is delicious and great quality, the five-star staff makes this place more of an experience and not just a meal!",

All the dishes were beautiful to look at and the plates looked impressive. It's hard to choose a restaurant in Vegas because there's so many good ones. We were at the Mandarin and walked to the Aria. All the restaurants were booked or had a wait but this steakhouse was able to accommodate a walk in party of 4. Nice experience but I'm not sure I will make an effort to come back unless I want to sit at the pretty bar for a quick drink and the octopus.",

The two of us sharing a seafood tower, some champagne, a New York, Yukon mashed potatoes and some beautiful grilled asparagus.  It was a trip down memory lane with a little glitch. Our steak wasn't quite right.  We ate it though, and were mostly done when the waiter came by and asked us for the third time how we were doing.  Caught in a moment, I answered honestly.  The steak is okay.  \"Just okay\"?  Next thing we knew, we were brought a whole new steak.  Thank you Jean Georges for knowing just how to take care of your customers and giving us a dinner celebration to remember.",

Excellent sides with my favorite being lobster mashed potatoes an the creamed corn was amazing. Also crab cake appetizer was amazing. The only negative thing if say is the server was a little busy on our arrival and I overheard him ask someone to bring us something and the person yelled he was too busy, very loudly. It was a little uncomfortable, but our server was excellent. I also noticed a variety of bread was placed on our table by that same staff member that was too busy. I had no idea what it was until our server brought out and described each type of bread to them. Overall, excellent experience and good and I would definitely go back.",

Don't misunderstand me as being cheap-I will certainly pay good money for a fabulous meal, but that is exactly what I want-\"fabulosity\" (Thanks, Kimora Lee Simmons).  I started off with a classic cesear, but it was nothing spectatular. My father ordered shrimp cocktail and the prawns were tasty, but again, nothing that made me jump off the seat. I had the lamb chops as my entree. Super disappointed. The lamb was not butchered well-it was frenched but, a lot of fat remained. In fact that fat to meat ratio was 2:1. It was not that the little lamb I did eat tasted poorly-I was just expecting an absolutely exquisite dining experience. Come on-this is Vegas after all.",

The Prime New York strip was bland but very good quality. I had the dry aged bone-in Prime NY strip and it was significantly better than the wet aged strip. Two others had Prime 6oz fillets and they were both very good. 6oz Wagyu fillet was fabulous. So, 4 different steaks all with different flavors. All steaks were cooked to perfection but none of them had what we considered to be a good char. We are all from TX and are all huge fans of fine steaks. In comparison to nicer restaurants in TX (Bohannan's San Antonio & 3 Forks Dallas) it was below par and was priced higher. Probably wouldn't return or recommend to friends who enjoy good steaks. Shrimp Appetizers were good but pork ribs were just average.",

The night of our reservations, we wanted to try to eat earlier and called about 2 hrs before asking if we could move our reservations up about 30 mins to an hour. I was told that they're completely full, so we had to keep our reservations for 8:30. When we arrived at 8:20, the restaurant was half empty. We shook our heads wondering why we couldn't have our reservations up, but oh well, we were seated promptly.  I ordered the NY Strip steak, while my girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. I also ordered mash potatoes as my side, which I was told by the waiter there was enough for two. When it came out, it was serving for one, which I could of easily consumed two bowls without any problem. My girlfriend decided to let me eat the entire (small) bowl of mashed potatoes, while she ate the corn, which was the other side we ordered. Other than the small portion, the mashed potatoes were delicious!!!  Our steaks were cooked perfectly to order.  We'd go back again, but would like to see the restaurant offer larger portions for sides.",

As a local, it is my overall favorite property. I love the bars, I love their casino floor and I always eat at Bardot (another place I love). This past Saturday Night, I ventured to Jean Georges for the first time, a place I usually stare at when I eat at Bardot. From the second I walked in, I was greeted by a hostess with a big, warm, sincere, engaging smile, welcomed by their Manager \"Pano\". Pano walked me to my table (beautiful spot) and oversaw evey step of phenomenal service. He introduced me to their server Ramon who was and is outstanding (there was another server whose name I forgot and I wish I hadn't because he was just as outstanding and attentive as Ramon). Pano, big as a tree and whose personality and warmth equal his stature introduced me to their Som, Reggie, who guided me thru an extensive and I mean EXTENSIVE wine list (I only drink French). The food? The porterhouse, the Sea Bass and the Calamari (which was the best calamari I have ever eaten and Im from the guinea capital NYC) were amazing.  I have been in hospitality my entire life and I am a local small business owner (I own a restaurant/bar with gambling) was this: I ordered an appetizer, am amazing seafood platter so to speak that was mounted, a server was walking  by my table right near closing (that is relevant after someone just worked a full shift), he had nothing to do with my table and from the corner of his eye he saw that the ice melted and the water was rising and he didn't want the water to spill on my table? Ladies and Gentlemen, THAT IS ATTENTION TO DETAIL. You cannot teach this. Im jaded in this city. In 3.5 years, the food in this city is great however the service is atrocious. Jean Georges? Arguably one of the best meals, one of the best dining experiences I have ever had in my life. If yelp doubts the validity of this review, please feel free to email me directly at <a href=\"mailto:smg19775@gmail.com\">smg19775@gmail.com</a> or call me at 917 510 4910. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the best restaurant in this city. Thank you to the entire staff. My parents will arrive on November 16th and you can believe that their first meal will be here. BLOWN AWAY. Thank you Pano, Reggie, your chef and those 2 amazing servers whose names I do not know...",

The bar is really cozy and the bartender was very accommodating as he didn't get my drink right and took the initiative to try again until getting it right!  When we sat at the table the service was quick with waters and menus. We ordered 2 bottles of pricey wines (hard to find anything decent under &100) and apps and dinner. Squash soup was very good, Tuna tartare was good but certainly not the best I'd tasted. My table all ordered steak which was average tasting for a high end steak house. I ordered the sea bass with a side dish of mushrooms. Sea bass was not great. It was dry, came with no sauce.  The sea bass with miso at the Yard House is better - at least it has a nice broth and some bok Choy. When it arrived it actually already came with a little bunch of mushrooms.  The waiter didn't mention it already came with mushrooms while taking my side order of mushrooms.  When I pointed out that if I had known it came with mushrooms I wouldn't have ordered a side of mushrooms his response was \"well it says on the menu that it comes with mushrooms\". We were all very taken aback as when you are paying the prices we paid I would have expected the waiter to say \"what other side can I bring you\"?  Instead they said they would take them off the bill but we're also going to take them away without offering any other option. This was just bad bad service for such a high restaurant. We were all shocked by the way two waiters reacted that it really left a bad taste in our mouths. The night before we had eaten at Picasso at Bellagio and the service was 10 times better as was the food. He food and the service at this restaurant aren't memorable but it is a nice environment.",

The bread came out fresh - it was warm, and the butter was room temperature (surprisingly I need to mention this as other high end restaurants served us cold butter and stale bread), there were also 4 different kinds of bread to try - of course myself and my husband tried all 4 - and they were all great.  For an appetizer we split the dungeness crab cake.  This crab cake was the most amazing thing, ever.  Seriously.  It was amazing.  We talked about going back to get another crab cake the rest of the trip.  I got the filet mignon and my husband ordered the 18 oz bone in rib eye and we split a side order of brussel sprouts.  The steaks were great, the sauces that came with them went well and had a lot of flavor.  Unfortunately we were too full for dessert.",

Looks fancy from the outside but inside it looks no better than a basic pub with very dim lights. Not very luxurious for a restaurant of this caliber. Cold tables with no tablecloths, and they don't enforce a proper dress code, so if you prefer to look nice, theres people nearby with tshirts and shorts. I ordered a Filet mignon and for an entre, the portion looked like an appetizer at best, and all you get is the meat, nothin else on the plate. I asked the manager why it took a full hour for the entres to arrive and he said that per health dept, all meat is from the freezer and takes longer than normal to fully cook. They weren't busy at all and there were like 10 waiters hovering around, but the service was terrible as it took 30+ min to get the salad, which was far from restaurant quality. So the food, service, and ambience was a terrible letdown. The hotel's restaurants are sorted by classes and I am shocked Jean George's made it into the prestige section. Avoid at all costs.",

We had the silky and sensuous tuna tartare and the buratta for apps & they were wonderful. The levels of flavor in the tuna tartare were tremendous.  It came with a delicate rice paper chip of sorts that was crispy and dissolved almost instantly once it hit my tongue - pretty neat and well paired with the tuna.  We both had the aged NY Strip (Waygu beef I think) and it was delicious, well seasoned & probably the best steak I've ever had. The sauces that accompanied the steaks were wonderful and I had a hard time selecting a favorite.  They were all delicious. The sleek cast iron plates and dishes were really interesting and made the steak look like a piece of art when it was presented. Very dramatic. The Lalique knives were beautiful and well balanced, I was very impressed with them.  We wrapped up the meal with the decadent molten lava cake and ice cream, which was out of this world.  I have his cookbook and have made the cakes myself, but obviously his were better!

It took us a long time to get there as the roads were extremely busy (Saturday, and Vday), so I really appreciated the fast seating. The service was good as expected.   The food was lovely. Pricey but reflects the quality that it delivers. For the appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared the wagyu beef carpaccio with black truffle fritter and we couldn't stop raving about it. Each bite was like a bit of heaven. I was sad when we finished it. I only wish there was more! But good things come in small packages.  Onto the entree. I had the filet mignon cooked medium rare. It was delicious and extremely tender. I'm drooling as I think about it. The sauces it came with were good. There's one for every mood. I especially enjoyed the soy-miso butter. It complimented the steak well. I love putting sauces in my food, but at times i omitted the sauce and enjoyed the cut the way it was.   My boyfriend had the bone-in ribeye cooked medium rare. He enjoyed it but thought the filet mignon was betterafter he had a bite of mine!   Sides: We ordered a side of truffle mashed potatoes and truffle fries (the special that night). We should've gotten something different because two potato sides proved to be too much to finish. We were stuffed!! Next time, I would get the bone marrow or the brussel sprouts!  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything we ordered. They have a huge wine selection too which is nice. I don't have much to say about this except i liked what I ordered. I would have more appreciation for the extensive wine list if I knew more about wine.   As for dessert - didn't get any. Too full. I left happy and satisifed :)   I would give it 4.5 stars, because the food was really good. Service was good, but servers weren't very personable. Perhaps that's not what they're going for anyway. Also, the tables were very close to each other, so at times i felt like I was forced to listen to another couple's conversation. And that can get a little awkward! So that's where the .5 went in terms of my experience.   That being said, I would definitely come back!",

I opted for the 8oz filet mignon (just USDA) it was cooked perfectly and we both were diggin the miso sauce. Yum yum! The spicy mustard saucey thing was good too. Steak sauce and berenaise were meh.... A1 steak sauce is better.  Idk why some people were so cranky in reviews about this place. Super yummy tasty. The only complaint was be there are like five different people helping they didn't know which of us drank flat water and which drank sparkling... Resulting in my fiancee having to have his flat replaced twice. Kinda funny to be honest.",

As we asked a diff waiter for our bill, our original waiter a 50s something blonde lady saw and rushed out our anniversary desert to try to save face. Had to ask a busser to refill our waters, huuuuge pet peeve. If you're spending $200+ on a meal, keep the water filled so you're not eating uncomfortably. Got the 8oz Filet Mignon, Maine Lobster, Mac and cheese, and bacon wrapped shrimp. Steak was cooked very well, very tender. Flavoring could have been better, they do provide 4 different sauces for your steak. Lobster was decent, a bit on the chewy side. Vibe is nice and romantic, ask to be seated in a quiet section to the right of the main bar as you walk in. It's more secluded and you're not next to a server station with clanking silverware.",

Our waiter was kinda blah but he and his team did a great job keeping up with a table of 8. Drinks came out quick as they started us off with bread and butter.   I won't speak for the other people at our table but I order the 12 oz. NY strip medium well. The steak was more like medium rare. I was steak did not have much flavor to it, however the sauces they provided were amazing. The sauces added lots of character to the steak. The steak come out warm to cool. I am used to a piping hot steak in Texas.  The table shared sides, the spinach was really good, lobster mash potatoes were amazing but there were only 4 small pieces of lobster in the potatoes, the macaroni truffle was amazing.  The ambience was really nice, dim lighting, good music, and classy.  We were not impressed with the dessert they provided for the Birthday's. I hate complaining when something is free but if that is the best they can do then they missed the mark.  Over all is was a good experience but when I am dropping that kind of money I expect a better steak and sides but I understand it is Vegas. I have had better at STK, Craft steak house, and Vic and Anthony's.",

This is not one of them. No meats were prepared as ordered, and no dish had creativity or a new touch. The kitchen needs to taste the food/ or better yet, put someone in the kitchen who cares about what is going out to customers. Shameful.",

Not a mistake. 3 star average is dead on.  Service was very attentive and friendly. The round of appetizers looked amazing - the table ordered a few is the seafood platters on ice. I'm not big on that stuff so skipped it, but the tuna tartare was tasty.  On to the meal - I ordered the 10oz dry aged strip, medium rare. It wasn't even close to that, it was cooked unevenly from medium to medium well, which is a crime. I never send food back, but did not hesitate to this time. Second steak has the exact same problem. Not sure how a steak place can screw up a good steak twice, but they did. At that point I ate a few bites because I was hungry.  When the waiter asked if I wanted it boxed up, I told him to take that back to the cook and tell him to learn what medium rare feels like to the touch before he ruins any more.  Coworker had the same steak, also a little over cooked. Said it was one of the more flavorless and tough steaks he's ever had. Same opinion from me. The pieces I did eat, had no flavor at all.  Should have stuck to something bone in.  No apologies from any manager or offer to make it right. Unheard of for a restaurant in this price bracket.",

I think tuna tartare must be good because my friends them finished up there plates really fast, then we had a fried calamari for appetizer and it's delicious. I then had crab cake for dinner.

However, if you're going to call yourself a fine dining establishment the service needs to greatly improve. It really made this a poor dining experience.   My husband and I took my mom to celebrate her 60th birthday. She seldom gets to go to nice restaurants so this was supposed to be a treat. It was some of the most terrible service we have ever received at a fine dining restaurant. Definitely not what we expect of a Jean Georges establishment.  My mom eats a bit slower than us. Our plates were frequently cleared before she was finished with her course during the tasting menu. This made everything feel very rushed. There was one course where she still had fork in hand and was chewing and they tried to clear her plate. I had to actually reach out and grab it and let them know she wasn't done. There was clearly still food remaining.  We frequently didn't have our next course of wine poured until the course had already been served. We also asked for some additional details regarding one of the courses and the server had no idea. He gave us some ingredients which were clearly what we had eaten in the last course.  Everyone was friendly, but they tried their best to rush us through. Honestly, the service was equivalent to what we would get at a big chain restaurant. It was incredibly disappointing. There are many other options in Vegas with equivalent food and much better service.",

I don't know if my palate has changed since those visits, or the restaurant has changed, but I just didn't find it as good as before. Everything was just ok, nothing spectacular. The filet I ordered was fine but not knock your socks off. The sides of trumpet mushrooms and lobster mash potatoes lacked pizazz. We skipped dessert , but probably more of the same. Even the service was very spotty. The sommelier was great in offering us a nice bottle of wine the match our tastes. The servers though lacked a personal touch. I don't understand this trend of not saying hello to people at as you approach a table and just start listing the specials, not a good first impression. My wife had to pour her own wine during dinner, she was totally appalled by that. Don't think they even did when they dropped the food. Overall, a very lackluster experience, definitely not worth the $$$ we spent, thank goodness for the room credits.",

    "text": "Value and food combo, I'd probably give this a 3.5 if there was an option. Presentation and service were both great - 5 stars. Lots of places to go in Vegas for Steakhouses. I did a fair amount of asking around, and I was staying at Aria so I wanted to check out Jean Georges. I was a single diner and sat at the bar. Gary was great at the bar. Enjoyed his company throughout dinner, and he provided great service.   Plenty of comments about the ambiance on here...dark decor, classic steakhouse feel. Full disclosure - I never left the bar area (which did have a TV for watching games).   On to food and drink reviews. Cocktail menu...I didn't look any further when I saw a Boulevardier on the menu, I'm a sucker for it. One of my favorite cocktails. It was good. Personal preference is Campari over the Aperol. Also prefer to be served neat/up instead of on the rocks.   I also hadn't eaten much that day so went for the tasting menu. First course was caviar dish served over a lemon gelatin. This one didn't really do it for me. Never fair to compare anyone to French Laundry, but I found myself longing for the \"Oysters and Pearls\" caviar dish from French Laundry. Next dish was the tuna tartare. Presentation was great on this one with the tall rice. Really enjoyed this one. Next was the burrata and fruits. I love burrata! Delicious. Could have done without so many apples and more burrata, but I also enjoyed this. Next up was the seared diver scallop. I don't eat scallops as often. Was good but wasn't out of this world. 3.5-4 stars out of 5. The dish I was most interested in trying was the Wagyu beef tenderloin. The steak was cooked perfectly (Medium-rare), so I appreciated that. I could tell the flavor was there. Where I left feeling disappointed in this one was the asian glaze, sauce that was distracting me from the great cut of beef sitting in front of me. I found myself trying to get the steak out of the sauce on the plate to not overpower what should be shining here. Found myself wishing I may have just gone with the large bone in ribeye instead. Lastly, the dessert was also delicious with a peanut butter brownie sundae. Very rich - couldn't finish it all at this point in the meal.   In conclusion, I'd come back here again, but I would be sure to pay attention to how they were preparing and serving the steak. I want it to be simple but delicious rather than distracting. Appreciate the great service!",

We had high expectations coming here after hearing it's the best steakhouse in Las Vegas but 4 out of 8 of our steaks were well done instead of medium. The steaks were so overcooked there was no juice on the plate. Basically $500 of high quality marbled meat ruined by this super master chef with 20 years of experience! The server was not surprised when we complained and said half the guests are complaining and he would fire the chef if he could. He said its an ongoing problem and the management has meeting about this everyday. Then he brought the replacement steaks and some of them were already cold, as if they took them from another order. Also the demeanor and tone of the servers was definitely not at a 5 star level. I think I don't need to say any more. I felt like we came to Sizzler. After reading some of the 5 star reviews, I am convinced they were paid to post them especially the one from Rod U. and Michael U.

The steaks have no flavor.  Maybe that's why they came with different sauces.  The mash potato was very liquid and Brussels spouts were burned.  Even the brownies were not so good.  Brio has better brownies than them.  Very Very disappointed.  We have eaten at many $$$$ restaurants and this is our least favorite.  We will not recommend to our friends.",

Out of our party of 8, 6 ordered steaks. 4 were improperly cooked, one so badly it was sent back. Med rare came out med, med came out well done.... After some swapping of steaks we ate. If it wasn't so late in the evening, we would have sent back more of them. The steak was reasonable, but not what I'd expect for the price. The appetizers were better. Should have stopped ordering there. Jean Georges' name is going to end up like Pierre Cardin's if he's not careful.",

We sat down and looked over the menu. We decided after the yelp reviews and the prices of the steaks that we were only going to get some appetizers and drinks.  We ordered some draft beer and a martini, which were both great. We also ordered some Oyster appetizers and some fried taco things. Both were excellent! If it wasn't for the high prices (yeah I know we're cheap) we should have stayed for dinner.  Customer service was decent as well.",

We got the side is truffle Mac n cheese (to die for) and grilled asparagus.  We also started with the tuna tartare which was perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ordered and our waiter was super friendly.  It was pricey but I. Expected it for a nice steak house. For 2 people it was $300, however, that included tip, 2 drinks each, a starter, 2 sides and the porterhouse we shared.  I'll definitely go back!!!",

    "text": "This place is VERY pricey, but totally worth it; especially if you need somewhere nice for a special occasion.  I ate here awhile back, and am just getting to sit down to write the review; but I do recall that everything was phenomenal.   1) The atmosphere is very sexy, dark lighting, and not fit for casual attire.  So to you Las vegas tourists: DO NOT go to this place in your half-wrapped towel, flip-flops, and swim attire after you've left the party pools (haha).  Ladies and Gents, don't be afraid to put on that nice sheath dress/or that tailored suit you've been wanting to wear; but have been saving for a special night.  It'll work out just fine here! 2) The cocktail menu is a decent size with unique and interesting specialties, and the beer selection isn't bad either.  I ordered The Diablo cocktail (I like a little spice), and I had no complaints.  The wine list is quite impressive as you can imagine as well. On to the food:  We ordered the Jumbo shrimp cocktail (which is hard to mess up in fine-dining), and oysters on the half-shell (which I look for anywhere I go). Both dishes were fresh, and I had to stop myself from ordering more oysters (haha). For dinner I ordered the Wagyu filet, and the table ordered sides of mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and the truffle mac and cheese.  No complaints with anything, and the filet was like BUTTER! It was cooked to perfection (MR), and was sooooo tender.  My favorite side was the brussel sprouts with pecan and avocado (the pecans complimented the sprouts so well!).  If you have the money to check this place out and throw-down almost $70 for a steak; this is the place to do it!",

    "text": "For our anniversary, my husband and I had tickets to Jason Mraz performing at the cosmo, we waited till almost last minute to pick a restaurant for dinner, so we decided to call Jean Georges because of the location, and we were pleased with our choice. The atmosphere is perfect for a romantic dinner. My husband enjoyed a beer, and I sipped on a delicious glass of moscato.   We enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer, but we left the pear and horseradish sauce on the plate, it was a rough combination. The shrimp appetizer is 3 pieces for $24, and the waiter offered to add a fourth piece for $7 more, but we declined. Around the same time as the Appetizer, the waiter brought us an assortment of fresh breads; pretzels, raisin, sourdough, and a crisp cheese crusted flatbread. They were good, as any fresh hot bread should be.   For our entrees, my husband chose the crispy short rib with polenta fries, and the truffle mac n cheese for his side. The short rib and the glaze on it was melt in your mouth delicious, the meat was falling off the bone, so good. The truffle mac n cheese was awesome, the pasta was so tender, the sauce was creamy and perfect, and the crumbs on top gave it the perfect little crunch. Grown up mac and cheese at its finest.  I ordered the crispy organic chicken with spinach, and the brussel sprouts for my side. Before my food arrived, i was expecting it to be a chicken breast half pan seared and roasted to make it crispy, what i was actually served was large whole chicken breast cooked to perfection, then coated and fried in a batter that sort of reminded me of a tempura batter, but better. The batter was light and did not stick to the chicken so i was able to enjoy both separately and together. It was not greasy or overly seasoned at all. The chicken was served on a bed of sauteed Spinach and a cheese sauce. It was deciduous putting all those flavors together. The side of Brussels were good, not amazing, it was about average of what you would find at other restaurants but appearance was beautiful. They were roasted and served with thick chucks of bacon and thin slices of pear(?). I wish the brussels had been roasted a bit longer so they had a bit more tenderness, still i enjoyed the dish anyway.  We asked for the dessert menu and instead were served a plate of their warm chocolate cake (chocolate lava) with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to share in celebration of our anniversary. It was a sweet gesture (no pun intended), and it was the desert my husband was planning to order, so he was in heaven. I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but it was good, maybe things taste better when they are free lol. The ice cream was amazing. Creamy and smooth, served on a be of sweet vanilla powder with a piece of caramelized sugar laid on top. It was the best ice cream ive had in a long time.  Price wise the meal came out to much less than we expected, having been to other steak houses I  the strip, i believe it was appropriate for the quality. I give this restaurant 4 stars for the service and food. But i was tempted to give less because of the photo service they provide in the restaurant. We had a photographer come to the table and take a few pictures. We reviewed the prints and selected two, expecting that they would be pricy, as in $40 range for the pictures. I almost choked when she came back with my receipt for $70. Definitely only something i would purchase on an occasion like this, but for that price?! Wow. We would never accept that again. It didn't ruin our night, just a bit of sticker shock before we headed over to the cosmo to enjoy the rest of our night.",

To top off the meal, my waiter brought me a digestif that was made in house with organic yuzu!!! It was like biting into the freshest lemon possible, followed by a warm hug",

Upon entering the hostess acted as if my wife and I weren't standing right in front of her (we were literally standing two feet in front of her, and there was no one else behind us). Another hostess ended up taking my name and said that it would be a 15 minute wait. So we sat at the bar. 60 minutes and a couple of cocktails later...still not seated. Knowing that the entrees were $$$$$, I decided I didn't want to give any of my money to such unprofessional service (save the bartender) and walked out. After walking past the hostess' on our way out, the one that took our names said, \"have a good night and thanks for coming.\"  Ended up working out anyways. Went across the way to Sirio and was greeted with exemplary service and a meal of a lifetime. The hostess was not only professionally dressed, but also professional and warm in demeanor, as was their entire waitstaff.",

(one star at best) We had an 8PM dinner and arrived to a pretty full house - several tables of large groups around.  It took forever for our waitress to come to the table to introduce herself and her assistant.  She was extremely short with any questions we asked and even the sommelier was, well, bitchy.  We got drinks we didn't order, were presented with sides we did not order and then had to pay for those errors.  Once the house started to clear, the service remained the same ... BAD!  Oh and we saw a table of four get up and walk out because they had waited so long - their plates had not even cleared..   Service aside, the food was outstanding!  Best chicken I've had in a long time, the sides were solid classics and the desserts to die for.  We had some salted caramel ice cream with popcorn that sounded strange but was positively mind blowing.  I would certainly go back for the food in hopes that they will pull the service up.",

Tasting $169/person comped, not so great & wish I'd used it at our other True favs.  Let me do a quick run down:  Osteria Caviar on a Meyer Lemon Geylee & Creme Fraiche on sea salt decor... EXCELLENT!    Foie Gras & Strawberry Granola... waste of Foie Gras, tasteless, except for the granola.  Absolute disappointment.    Warm Asparagus w/ Chanterelle Vinaigrette.. more like lemon squeezed on top w/ mushrooms.  Nothing beautiful like the fancy word & wow, a simple asparagus I make better at home as a part of the tasting...   Caramelized Scallops were part of what I thought would be a pick-me-up in the tasting.  Never again.  Sandy & horrid.  I have never had such horribly dirty & undercooked Scallops ever.  I hate eating Scallops w/ grit.  Wagyu Filet ... mine was cooked to perfection & melted in my mouth!  I gave my boyfriend the majority of mine cause his was overcooked, but we didn't wanna waste it so he ate it.  Strange if it was the same Chef how both came out so different when ordered at the chefs preference.    To top it off, the dessert with the tasting was a Salted Caramel Sundae w/ Caramel popcorn & candied pecans, which was delicious & a wonderful palate cleanser from the previous disappointments.  Overall, this is the third time I've been here on a $400 comp & am sadly done trying again.  I am an honest yelpers so give chances.  Maybe a bad night gets old with all of the amazing restaurants at our finger tips here.  I thought trying a tasting would be a chance for me to broaden my horizons from only ordering steak since I am from the Midwest where the steak is raised next door.  I was wrong.",

    "text": "Came here after 5 years with the fiance and it reminded us how amazing this restaurant is and we need to come here more often. Every bite was spectacular and melted in your mouth.  The location is easy to find on the second floor at the Aria hotel, following the signs.  We made a reservation at 7 and seated us immediately after arriving 10 minutes late. Once seated they let us know that 3 people would be serving us. They brought bread with a side of butter. The bread was slightly warm and the top tasted like a pretzel because of the salt. The slight warmness of bread is the only criticism and reason for stars on this review.   I am not a big steak eater but I did try my fiance's wagyu and it is the best that I have tasted compared to other steakhouses in Southern Cali. I would also say the same about the sea bass. The sea bass and lobster mash is the best compared to Mastros and Salt Creek Grille. The 4 different sauces were delicious and my favorite was the miso ginger. The food was so good that it didn't even need sauces but I did try.  We did bring our own bottle of wine which came with a $50 corkage fee which was reasonable when looking at their wine list. If going out with a significant other I think this is the way to go since this place is pricey. And you will have an experience here. We also ordered an expresso martini which was amazing! I would recommend if are planning on skipping dessert and maybe have a liquid dessert.  We did try the molten cake but failed to finish since we were so full. My fiance doesn't even like this cake but he ate most of it since it was so rich.",

I arrived with another guest without a reservation and was cordially greeted by two hostesses who were friendly, helpful and without attitude. We were seated quickly.  Escorted past a cool circular bar that greets you at the entrance, we entered a modern yet comfy dining room with a nice buzz of atmosphere.  I'm on a diet but didn't have any problem ordering healthy. I had the wedge salad and substituted vinaigrette for the blue cheese and followed it with a filet and side of asparagus. The meat quality was obvious and melted in my mouth. The salad and asparagus were also excellent.  My friend splurged a bit more with 2 apps and a NY. He tried the carpaccio with black truffles. He went nuts and gobbled the 3 portions up before I could snap my usual pic. He was raving about the carpaccio and was looked very happy eating his steak.  This is a fine dining experience with quality ingredients expertly prepared. Expect a reasonable bill beforehand.  We loved it. I'll be back for my next steak fix!",

Service was amazing and we didn't have to wait too long.  We were celebrating our anniversary so they were super attentive and helpful with our celebration.  The chocolate ball of dessert at the end was a nice little surprise, though the candy inside wasn't very tasty.

Between the dim lighting and the combination of metal and woodwork, it strikes a really lovely balance between elegant and contemporary, making it an ideal spot for either romantic engagements or client dinners. As a bonus, Circular Center Bar is great to grab a drink while waiting for the rest of your party to arrive, or simply to sip and chat with those who happen upon it inside.   While we were seated quickly, the service was definitely slow to start. It seemed to take about 10 minutes just to get water to the table. But, after that, everything went quickly and smoothly!   We ordered the Filet Mignon, Crab Legs and Scallops with sides of Truffle Mashed Potatoes, Asparagus and a Beet Salad.   The Beet Salad was very good but definitely on the acidic side - however, I am not personally a huge \"beet\" fan, so I only just sampled this dish. The Scallops were perfectly cooked (crisp on the outside, tender on the inside,) the clarified butter was a perfect compliment to the Crab Legs (how could you serve them without?) and the Filet Mignon was expertly prepared, with clear differences between [my] Med Rare order and the Medium cut.   One unique feature was the roulette of housemade sauces presented to us with pairing suggestions for each of our entrees. To be honest, we struggled to remember which was for what, but our table had a blast trying to isolate the different flavor profiles of the sauces before playfully quizzing our server on the answers (he passed with flying colors, of course!)  I ordered the Truffled Mashed Potatoes and let me tell you, they are very, very rich. I found them to be a little on the salty side too, but they are incredibly creamy, almost *too* creamy. While it didn't stop me from heaping multiple servings onto my plate, I did almost feel like I was just eating straight up butter.   As for dessert, you cannot go to a Jean George restaurant without trying his Warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake (aka Chocolate Molten Lava Cake.) In fact, (and much to our surprise,) it is Jean George who is credited with creating the Molten Lava Cake as a dessert item - so by trying it here, you're trying The True Original! It is everything you would hope it to be: warm, gooey, chocolatey, rich, moist and absolutely decadent.  Food aside, I was most impressed with the plethora of knowledge our server possessed, not just on the menu, but of Jean George himself and the history of his restaurant(s). He eagerly shared his \"insider info\" with us about an impromptu, \"cook-off\" between Jean George and another Celebrity Chef on the Strip, the history of the Molten Lava Cake and more!   Be prepared to take your time here. While the overall service was tempered, it will take at least two hours for you get through appetizers, the main course and dessert...none of which you'll want to miss!",

As we sat down the waiter told us that his recommendation would be the best steak he's ever had his words not mine. So we took his recommendation my wife ordered a 3 ounce steak from Japan. I ordered a 8 ounce steak. Both were extremely chewy tons of fat. Everything else was fine but $380 of our bill was for the steaks!  Literally I've had better steaks at Denny's!  They have a 3 1/2 star for reason. They probably have some dishes that are good but stay away from their Way overpriced steaks.  As soon as we let the waiter know we were less than happy with the steak the whole experience changed almost fate made us feel bad because we didn't like their product.!! Stay away!",

The lobster mashed potatoes were outstanding.  The entire business dinner was beyond a success, and I can't thank the staff enough for the wonderful service.  This is an amazing place that is high end and pricey, but worth every penny.  You get what you pay for and a little kindness to the staff goes along way.  Needless to say my business meeting here was a success and the staff and food played a huge part in impressing our client.

    "text": "The portions are not up to par with the price point. Seriously...I cried a little. My wallet cried a lot.   The atmosphere is luxurious, intimate and dim. We had a reservation at 7pm for a group of 9 girls on a Saturday evening. There really wasn't a need for a reservation as the restaurant wasn't packed, but better safe than sorry. Some people tend to dine there before a show. Our waiter was kind to ask if we were in a time crunch for a show. We were not, but if you are, they can notify the chefs to expedite your meal to catch your show.   Anyway, everything was above my means, but when in Vegas, I must dine well. I opted for filet mignon, but there are two options with a $2 difference - 1) 8 oz filet mignon 2) Paso Prime Grass Fed Beef 10 oz filet mignon.  I don't know the difference so I went for the cheaper option - 10 oz. It had a nice char on the outside and it was a nice medium rare. However, the exterior was very salty and a bit tougher than I expected. I was a bit disappointed by that.   SIDES ARE NOT INCLUDED  The sides are small, but very rich and creamy. It's best to share if you can. We went with Truffle Mac n Cheese ($18) and Truffle Mashed Potatoes ($20).   Would I come back here again? Most likely not. With the sides shared, a $50 a-ok steak and a cup of coffee to cap my meal, I nearly dropped a bill on myself. I just can't justify that amount for the level of dissatisfaction. Not to say the meal was bad, my taste buds and brain just didn't agree.",

The bus girl, however was very friendly and responsive to our request. We spent 600 for four people dinner and it was absolutely not worth it. I give two star because of the bus girl. Boring food and awful service. Go somewhere else.",

We ordered few different kinds of steak with all sauces, asparagus, spinach, cream corn and two kinds of mashed potatoes: regular one and truffle one.  The waiter was unable to recommend which meat is the best for ordering it medium well and which wine would go nicely. Food took forever, and our time was limited so the mood went a bit down. The steaks were good, but not best I had in Vegas. However, I loved both truffle mashed potatoes and cream corn. Delicious! Portions weren't very big, so the whole dinner was not really worth the high prices. And they charge cosmic amounts for the simplest beverages. You can easily skip this place, as it's just an average restaurant.",

The Chilean sea bass was incredibly salty due to the miso sauce. The mushrooms served with it was chewy and lacked flavor. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly, but paired with truffle mashed potatoes that tasted like baby food. I regret trying this place. The server gave no recommendations and the food we ordered was terrible. Back to joes steakhouse at Caesars we go!",

Food - 3 out of 5 stars - bread arrangement at the beginning was probably the best thing on our table. we ordered mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and a porterhouse to share. porterhouse came out luke warm while mac and cheese was bubbling HOT. weird!! you would think that the $100+ steak would have came out hot and have been the star of the table.  Management - 4 out of 5 - we paid the full amount + 18% gratuity on the subtotal (minimum that we pay for even bad service) even after expressing our dissatisfaction. after pining over the situation for one day, decided to give the restaurant a call. I spoke to Joon, the GM, and he made the situation right by comping us a portion of the meal. I thought that was fair.",

We started out with the appetizer that I can't spell with the beef carpacio  think is how you say it. Melt in your mouth truffle explosion of goodness! Followed by us splitting the 18oz bone in ribeye which was perfectly charred and came with 4 sauces on the side. A side of the mac and cheese which was to die for and then also a side order of the bone marrow. The marrow presentation was rustic and ow so savory. My wife was a little of put by the Fred Flintstone bone, but I really appreciated the look. Also we was new to eating marrow and the wait or actually set us up our first piece of brioche to show us how it's done! And finally for dessert they brought us out a comp molten cake and ice cream which delivered epic flavor. I recommend splitting the steaks above 16oz and you won't fill over stuffed afterwards and be able to enjoy your night rather then slipping into a blissful food coma! The service was top notch, I don't believe my ice tea or water went below half the entire night.",

Our waiters were very nice and offer suggestions on drinks and entrees. I picked New York steak w/mash potatoes. The steak was tender with options of sauces to put on steak. Best to mix miso and jalapeno sauce on the steak which was delicious. The mash potatoes in the cast iron mini pan was delicious. My strawberry drink was delicious too. The free appetizer of bread was hot and moist with free butter. I would go back the next time. It was so nice to get $50 credit on dinner.",

We were taken to our table where our server Brad took very good care of us..  As for food, I had my signature bone in ribeye and Brad did ask the chef to cook it the right way... I was surprised that it was charred on one side only... Chef, next time you owe me both sides, maybe he was worried on not getting it \"rare\", anyways, the steak was great, very good flavor and the right amount of fat for the ribeye... We also had the bone marrow...  \"Flinstone\" type of bone in your table... For my taste, chef, you should send it with some thick salt on top, it will give it this extra kick... The toast you sent is maybe too thick for such a delicate taste, maybe go to the drawing board on that one...  Brussel sprouts were nice and crisp... My partner had the petite fillet with the foi gras on top... He was very much pleased by flavor and tase, so again, high five there...  We also had a couple of bottles of Darioush, I would hope this place would keep wine at the correct temp... They were both over the serving standard.... Glasses were fine... The place was clean. I have to say that I was a little reluctant at the time for the reviews I read, but at the end, I was impressed.. Enjoy",

The Aria has all thier restaurants tucked back in a corner with being the center. Walking in the dark swanky resturant the entire dinner is an experence.  We started with some shrimp cocktail, tuna tartar and tomato and mozzarella salad. All were fantastic but the shrimp cocktail was fantastic for the 2 sauces they brought with it.  Up next was dinners. We ordered a sea bass, lobster, NY strip, and then my steak - the special - Australian Tomahawk Ribeye. Photo is included because it was just so funny! It was a full bone in rib that's for sure. We got the roasted potatos truffle Mac and cheese and Brussel sprouts for sides. All the food and wine was great. I do wish they had a rose by the glass though. The only reason I went for 4 stars and not 5 is the waiter was a little too friendly. I expect service to be a little more understated but there were times when he was just to friendly. We were trying to finish conversations but he was taking to long with banter.  Other than that everything was fantastic!!",

Steak and lobster came with a hefty price of $185 and a bottle of wine was $600 each so come planning to drop a sh-t ton t of money.  A very nice splurge for a night out with friends but I'm still questioning if a $3000 tab for 10 people is worth it.

We decided not to head all the way to the Palazzo for dinner, but instead try out the Steakhouse at Aria.  It's tucked away on the Promenade level of the hotel.  We've stayed here several times and never even knew it existed.  We were pleased with our decision.   That afternoon, we glanced at the video menu in the hallway area and decided to make reservations there the same day.  No problem, got right in.   Seated immediately, and our server arrived for drink orders.  She was great--wish I knew her name. They didn't offer an \"early evening menu\" but I had seen it on the video menu screen earlier in the day.  I opted for that at $69.  It included a starter salad (orig $16,)  filet mignon (orig $58) and a warm chocolate cake (orig $15.)  So the total savings was about $20.  My husband had the Porterhouse Ribeye, and we added the truffle mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious.  The mac and cheese was good, but nothing to scream about.   Service was impeccable.  We had a very attentive and friendly waitress who showed me to the restroom, when I appeared lost.   We will visit here again when we return.  Great food and great service.",

    "text": "I had been meaning to try Jean Georges for quite a while.  I'm happy to report that my trip was long overdue!  They jump up into my top steakhouse tier that now only includes 3 spots.  I went with my personal classic steakhouse choices since this was my first visit:  Appetizer/salad:  None  Bread:  Pretzel.  This was a perfect way to start the meal.  I'm happy to see that pretzel bread has become a norm at steakhouses.  Entree:  Australian Wagyu 6 oz Filet Mignon.  This was the hero of the meal and it delivered.  That was the sole factor in propelling Jean Georges in my mind.  I had it cooked medium rare, and the taste was amazing!  Perfectly tender.  They offer an array of sauces that were great, but the steak stands alone (how I prefer it).  I'd love these sauces when I'm eating something that NEEDS sauce, but this steak does not.  Sides:  Truffle Mashed Potatoes and Creamed Corn.  Both were excellent choices and would repeat.  The setting/design of the restaurant caught my eye immediately as well.  I will definitely be back for that Australian filet again!",

    "text": "We rated this place as two stars but truthfully it is actually 1.5 stars. Where do I begin. Well, after reading some reviews on yelp, and considering that we are guests at Aria, we decided to try out their steakhouse Jean Georges. Sigh. Where do I start? The overall meal was horrid.  We were seated next to a few ladies, one of which was talking very loudly of how she had gone on a date with an ex-football player of the Cleveland Browns?  She was talking about how he wasn't the smartest/sharpest tool in the box. So annoying.  Unnecessary and annoying. Like what do I write here? Should I write about how salty the steaks were?  SALTY.  We were flabbergasted but tried to eat it as much as we could.  Ugh. 40-50 dollars a steak which was inedible due to the enormous amount of salt. My fiances steak was very rare when she had asked for medium. The thing that was most upsetting was when we decided to complain to our server she said she would talk to the chef and we figured something might have been done.  Free desert, no charge for the rare steak,etc., but absolutely nothing was done. She came back to the table, asked if we would like dessert as if nothing was wrong.  We were clearly upset and said no and just asked for the check which she gave at that time.  I opened the check and saw that nothing was done and that..  ..The CHECK was as is.  Shaking head. I asked to speak to the manager, and thankfully, she took out the filet mignon.  We were just upset, because our server could have spoken to the manager to alleviate the situation, but we had to take the matter into our own hands.   Overall, The STEAKS were very salty.  They might as well pack the steak in salt and serve it to you. The STEAKS were cooked poorly.  Red rare for a medium steak. The server could have made us less mad had she done something about the CHECK before bringing it back to the table. We'll never be back and we don't recommend you waste your money here. There are plenty of other great steak houses in Vegas.",

    "text": "M cousin came into town with a group of buddies for a guys weekend. Where else could guys go but to a steakhouse to eat? We are all good spenders and so this figured about as good as any place on the strip. What was truly the greatest experience of our meal was we were seated in the chefs table room. This private room was awesome and perfect for a buncha guys to let loose. And what helped that even more was the waiters. One of the servers was a rapper who gave us a great impromptu display of his abilities and guided us through the menu. The other was a guy with a great sense of humor who would make quips as he left the room. I'd come back here just for that kind of awesome service. The steaks were good. We all got filet mignon or ribeyes. Cooked really well and had a great flavor. It took the addition of some amazing sauces that were included to really kick it up to an interesting taste profile. The sides of truffle mashed potatoes and asparagus were equally as good. It was all really good - not exceptional though as other steakhouses in Vegas have been for me. The desert of the molten volcano cake (which was supposed to be a chef Georges original creation) was well prepared and an excellent cap to a good meal. Anywhere in Vegas that employees servers of this degree deserves recognition. It makes the experience worthwhile and I'd go back to try some more there just to support them. It works as a steakhouse and serves you plenty of food for a reasonable strip price. 7 guys made it out for under $700 which was amazing considering we all ordered drinks, 7 steaks, 3 desserts, and 7 sides.",

I had the Sea bass, it was over cooked and too salty, and send it back. My wife had the NY strip, I ordered one to replace my fish.  They were not cooked evenly, and were a little dry.  I know steak houses use a laser to check temperature. If your job is working the grill in a steakhouse, you should be able to cook a perfect steak be sight and touch.  Come on, in a restaurant in Aria charging $50/ entree, I shouldn't be complaining about the preparation of our meal.",

The service was cloying and there was a cheesy theme park photographer going from table to table to capture the \"special\" experience and trying to sell you prints.  Courses were timed strangely, and coffee, etc. followed our desserts by about 15 minutes.  On each course, the servers would literally hover around you and say \"Here is your amazing sea bass course.  Isn't is exceptional?\".  Awkward!  The courses were good, but not great (although the steak actually was pretty exceptional).  Decent wine list; cool space.  But at these prices, there are much better places to go in Vegas in terms of quality and service.",

    "text": "One star might be generous, but it is the lowest I can give.  While this is from the same Celebrity Chef as the Bellagio's Prime Steak House; there is little comparison in food between the two.  This was a MAJOR disappointment.  A party of 3; two of us started with cocktails.  Apple Martini tasted like a Virgin Martini.  Had to send it back for Vodka.  Espresso Martini tasted like it was made with burnt coffee.    Appetizers:  Lobster Bisque - the WORST I have ever tasted.  Campbell's Soup would have been more welcome.  (so would Safeway brand).  Sent it back & got the Foi Gras with Apple Jalapeno Jelly.  Was more like Jalapeno Jalapeno Jelly.  Could not taste any fruit.  Nothing fruity or acidic to cut the richness of the fat that is inherent with Foi Gras.  Simple balsamic Vinegar would have made this far more enjoyable.  At $32.00 for an appetizer it was quite displeasing.  Other appetizers at the table were a Wedge Salad; which came with only a tiny drizzle of Blue Cheese dressing.  It took several requests to get more.  A beet salad was OK, but nothing exciting.  Entree's - Two New York Strips and one of the evening's specials, a 16 oz Bon-in Fillet.  One Strip was ordered Med-Well, came to the table Med-Rare.  The other was cooked properly (Med) but full of Gristle.  The Fillet was the only saving grace of the evening.  Cooked Rare as ordered and cut like butter.  Truly delicious.  All came with the House Verde Sauce on the side (Jalapeno based) which did not compliment the flavor of the meat.  We ordered Bearnaise on the side, which went much better.    For sides, we ordered the Black Truffle Fritters which were listed as being made with a cheese ( I don't recall the exact variety).  They were a house specialty, or so we were told.  Once again, all we could taste was Jalapeno.  I could have sworn that there was even a hint of Jalapeno in the Asparagus.  After the main course, we had enough of the very pricy and mostly palate displeasing offerings.  For desert, we went down to the Casino level for delicious offerings at Jean Philippe Patisserie.    My advice is to stay far away from here.  If you want a good steak, there are plenty of fantastic options available in Vegas, Including Jean-Georges good offering - the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  His named offering is simply awful!   As I said, a BIG disappointment.",

Side dishes, we had asparagus, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach.

Really enjoyed talking with the bartender and, yes, the popcorn is relish and not greasy. Everything is costly for what you get. Appetizer size would be enough for dinner, with a side or salad. The salmon also good, but not spectacular. Very disappointed in the apple pie, but I have yet to find a great apple pie in Vegas. Everyone thinks that apple pie needs to be reinvented--IT DOES NOT.  That's why the saying goes, \"As American as apple pie.\"  It's an ICON. Jean Georges made the same mistake everyone makes, lots of crust and almost no apples, and the apple filling itself  was subpar. If you're one of those who removes the crust and eats only the apples, you'll be done in three bites. We need to have a pie cook off every year in Vegas, focusing on a different pie each year.  Would someone please get this going!?",

    "text": "This is a pricey steakhouse, and as far as their entrees, it is totally worth the pricetag. The service, however, is mediocre, at best. We had an 8:30 reservation, and arrived about 10 minutes early. We were not seated until 9:10. I assumed the restaurant was overly busy, yet that was not the case. We sat at the bar to wait, and though I did prompt the hostess about our table, she simply apologized (we were not comped with absolutely anything).   Once we were seated, we ordered the \"sushi sampler\" as an appetizer (around $30). The waiter insisted we get salads before our entrees, but thought the \"sampler\" plus a salad, plus an entree would be too much. Little did we know that by \"sampler\", they meant four tiny pieces of crispy rice topped with raw fish. Though they were delicious (I think the chipotle mayo they use is awesome), you'd better order three or four appetizers if you're really hungry (like the crab leG...yes, singular). After our tiny appetizer, we waited about 25 minutes to get our entrees. Again, it was odd given that the restaurant was at about 30% capacity, on a Friday night. We got the Chilean Seabass with MushrooM (again, singular, in case you're wondering), for around $40, and it was absolutely delicious, flaky, and buttery. We also got the bone-in Rib-Eye steak (I think for around $60), that came with three sauces (two of which the waiter annoyingly insisted were his favorites). The miso soy butter is to die for, and it perfectly complemented both the steak and the fish. We also ordered the truffle mashed potatoes and the bone marrow as side dishes (each for about $20). The mashed potatoes were good, but nothing to rave about. As for the bone marrow (on toast), it was delicious.   We were celebrating a birthday, and we did get a complimentary flourless chococalate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Nothing to get too excited over, but it was a nice gesture.   Overall, it is a delicious place and we would go back, yet the service is absolutely lacking. For the pricetag you'll end up paying, you'd expect top-of-the-line service.",

At least their bone-in dry-aged ribeye done rare plus was just perfection. and their bone marrow was probably one of the best i've ever had. calamari was good, crab fritters were only OK.    i've live in NYC and have eaten my way across all the steakhouses, del frisco's being one of my favorites for ribeye.

As for the food, the way their rice cracker crusted tuna was prepared was perfect!  I could taste the citrus without it overpowering the rest of the seasonings.  Dinner was served with a small plate of a variety of breads.  Each piece was a taste all on its own.  I found their chilean sea bass to be average, however.  The dish was supposed to be prepared with miso-yuzu glaze and it did taste like it but seemed a bit dry.  I've had better miso-yuzu glazed fish from Trader Joe's. So, paying $39 for it as opposed to a bigger, much tastier $8 prepared dinner from TJ's made the dining experience under par.  I remember having a couple of drinks but they must not have been that memorable because I can't even recall which ones I had.",

I find it important to note that Aria, the hotel the restaurant is in, just opened its doors on Wed 12/16 and from what I was told Fri 12/18 was the first night the restaurant was open to the public. The price point was higher; we spent around $100 per person, with drinks appetizers and salads, main courses and sides (this is excluding the 2 bottles of wine). The food was excellent and what we would expect from this type of restaurant, and though the flow of the meal was a bit on the slow side, as I said they had just opened so we expected there to be kinks for them to work out. The wait staff was nothing but friendly and helpful, other than the sommelier which left some to be desired. He didn't really know the wines, and just didn't seem like he wanted to be there given his comments. I think the only thing that was a standout negative was the napkins. I think because they are new, they have a lot of lint coming off of them, so every time someone would get up to use the restroom and the wait staff would fix the napkins, the lint would fly in the air and get in the glasses. As I said, they were new so, though it was a bit unappetizing, it was understandable. We told the hostess about it as we were leaving and they seemed aware by that point. Now, I usually don't write this much for reviews, but given the one review shown for this place (which I find did not at all give it justice), I wanted to give a little more info. Overall, great place and as Vegas locals, we will go again.",

When Mr. Nostrils matter-of-factly announced that we could  order a lobster tail for $200, there was no problem containing our excitement. We politely declined. Instead we ordered three hors d'oeuvres to enjoy in the sparsely crowded restaurant and to the dismay of nostrils-boy we declined any main course selections and desserts. We received our final tab of $125 (three appetizers, three drinks). While the last bites were entering our mouths, the service level escalated. In a matter of seconds, our plates, utensils, and fabric placemats were promptly removed. We sat there at our bare table with three half-filled water glasses. \"Shall we request water refills and relax a tad longer,\" I asked my dinner companions? I guess I was surprised that my dinning mates confused efficient service with the bum's rush, but we left hungry and disappointed.",

    "text": "Its a bit difficult to say if the food here is any good or not. I'm writing this review while going on 45min. waiting for the food to arrive, after ordering. Considering the price and level of the restaurant, the service and speed leaves a lot to be desired.   Hold on, after convincing the waiter we deserved and expected to eat in under an hour, our order has finally arrived! Now about the food: Overall, very, very good. We started with the Caesar Salad which was excellent with a tangy Dijon/Caeser dressing. I had the \"slow cooked\" Salmon with a side of fries that I would definitely recommend. A note about the fries: The fries alone were very good, light and crispy. However they were served with plain old Heinz ketchup. Not a good move for a restaurant of this level. There seemed to be special sauces for pretty much everything, why leave out the fries? My wife had the Fillet Mignon. She had asked for it to be cooked medium well. After the waiter used the excuse that the order was taking a long time because the steak was ordered medium well, it showed up medium rare. Go figure... either way the steak was excellent as was the salt and pepper crusted baked potato. The steak came with a really interesting side sauce made from cilantro, mint, lemon grass and several other tasty ingredients. It was very good on the steak and I might add, really nice with my french fries.   So when we return to Vegas which we do regularly, would we also return to Jean Georges Steak House? Nope. Nice atmosphere, good food but the service just isn't worth the price. By the way, after the waiter used an innocent steak as an excuse for slow service I decided to head back to the kitchen myself to check on our order, and maybe see if they could use some help to speed things up. My wife had the rare urge to restrain me so kept me from hunting down our dinner. My bet is that if the level of service continues as it is, some one Else's husband or wife will seek to encourage rather than restrain.",

    "text": "For these prices I would expect a 5 star experience.  The positives:  Atmosphere is really cool. Love the design and the layout. It is dark, but I think all good steakhouses should be a little dark.   Service was very good. Not exceptional and will explain that in a moment. The hostess was very kind and efficient. We checked in and waited at the bar for the other member of our party to arrive. When he did the hostess lead him to us at the bar and we were seated immediately.  Our servers (there were two) we very knowledgeable about the menu and were extremely pleasant. However the one server would always interrupt our conversation. After the third time it got annoying. Please wait until at least we finish a sentence before you start to ask questions! If it wasn't for that the service would have been 5 stars. Also, two of us wanted to do the tasting menu, but they refused saying that everyone at the table has to do the tasting menu. Our server informed us that the chef refuses to allow any exeptions to this because it is 5 courses and it ruins the experience if it is not enjoyed by everyone. Really? I find that hard to believe. Everyone ordered an app and 3 of us got dessert an 2 people got salad. That was hard to believe and kind of aggravated us from the start.   The food was very good, but not really worth the price. We had caesar salad and foie gras to start.  Both were good, but the foie gras (at $28) wasn't worth the price.  However, I had the special which was a 300 day dry aged Australian porterhouse. That was probably the most flavorful steak I've ever had. Everyone else's meal was very good, but each agreed that they have had a better meal. For sides we had sauteed spinach (they originally brought out creamed spinach and had to correct it, but they did this very quickly). We also had mashed potatoes (awesome), lobster mashed potatoes (even more awesome, but that side cost $21- ouch), and a bone marrow app that was very good.  We had dessert which was good, but not incredible. And after such a rich meal just couldn't finish it. We had the apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream (the ice cream was amazing) and a warm chocolate cake. The cake was good, but so rich we could hardly eat it, even splitting between 2 people.   Price was pretty expensive. Our dinner was $400 before tip and we did not have any alcohol at all. And one person in our party only had chicken as an entree because they do not eat red meat.  I think for these prices everything you order should be spot on. And I can say that out of everything we ordered only a few things stood out as exceptional - Bone marrow side dish, lobster mashed potatoes (but very pricey), and my 300 day dry aged porterhouse. Oh, and the cinnamon ice cream.  I can think of a few other steakhouses in Vegas that I would rather go than this place again. BOA is good, and I still love Capital Grill and Morton's is probably my favorite.  Overall good, I don't regret going there, but I don't think I want to visit this place again given all the other choices in Vegas.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week 2011. This was the final place we dined for RW. It wasn't as good as our dinner at Scarpetta a few days earlier, but was good enough to make me want to go back and eat more.  The watermelon gazpacho was light and refreshing. The pickled peach and goat cheese salad for the first course was delicious. Loved the depth in flavors and textures with the pistachio and crystallized wasabi.  The NY strip had some good-looking grill marks and was nicely charred for a medium-rare steak. But it was a bit chewy for my tastes. The crunchy potato and tomato compote that accompanied it were amazing. My wife's soy glazed short rib was one of the best short ribs we've had (second to Fleur de Lys, back in the day).  She also got the chocolate cake for desert. The one bite I had (that's all she would let me have) was pretty damn good. My key lime pie was fabulous. I loved the pop rocks on top. It was a whimsical addition that added plenty to their modern take on this classic dish.  Even with the RW prices ($50.11 per person) it was pricey after drinks, tax and tip. But that's to be expected from any steakhouse on the Strip. The rest of their menu looked good, so I'll be back to try other dishes.",

We started with crusted tuna and french onion soup. The tuna was fresh but a bit bland despite be served with a sriracha mayo sauce. The soup was rich and flavorful. Next we had wood grilled whole snapper and the short rib. The short rib is really fantastic we loved it last time too. The snapper was nicely prepared and flavored from the smoke of the grill. We had jalapeno cream corn and truffled mashed potatoes. Both were positively delicious. Tab was around $160, it's a bit of a splurge, but well worth it.",

    "text": "The service at this restaurant is amazing. Our friend Boris was very friendly and made light jokes throughout dinner.   Appetizer calamari. The squid was decadently tender and just melted in your mouth. I regret to say that it was a bit on the salty side but we weren't unhappy enough to send it back, but Boris gave us another pelligrino on the house for it. The siracha mayo has this lemon tang to it. Super delicious. I just don't understand why they gave you a whole bowl of the sauce. You really don't even use 1/30th of it. Lol.  Shared the prime rib special with my brother, and it was really good. First of all, this dish was meant to be shared so it was massive. I can't remember how many ounces it was but we had trouble finishing it. It had a breaded crust that packed on some great flavor and there were so many sauces to use if you aren't too fond of the cilantro thyme herb (Boris listed all the ingredients, but I just remember a lot of greens) butter that it comes with. Everyone else's steaks were cooked to perfection as we'll. be warned! That tomahawk rib eye is huge, and you should consider sharing it if you plan on getting sides like we did.   Lobster mashed potatoes were not so great because it was served like a puree, which is definitely not what I'd look for in mashed potatoes. The black truffle Mac and cheese is soooo good. I'd get an order to share! The mushrooms were also a nice side and I would order again if I ever came back.   Would I come back? Yeah if I won money gambling. Haha! It was definitely not light on the pocket. Overall, I want to give this place 3.5 since the food stood out but there were some issues with the food as mentioned above, but for Boris I'll round up!",

    "text": "This is a review for the Restaurant Week menu.   On the final day of Restaurant Week we decided to check out Jean Georges. I have been really interested in try it for a while. I came with my fella, two fellow Yelpers and another friend.  While waiting for our party my fella and I sampled some of their cocktails at the bar. I ordered the pineapple mojito and my fella ordered a very fruity looking strawberry champagne drink. I wasn't entirely impressed with these offerings and probably wouldn't try them again.  We all started with with the watermelon gazpacho. It had some interesting flavors, but I didn't feel it was a great palate starter. The ladies all chose the peach salad with goat cheese to begin and the men got the panzanella salad. I was lucky enough to be able to try them both and they were great. I preferred my peach salad, but they both had great flavors and textures. We all chose the NY Strip for our main course. Since it was a steakhouse we just couldn't resist. I don't typically order a NY Strip when at a steakhouse, but it was extremely tasty, well cooked and seasoned. The tomato compote went excellently with the steak. Flavorful and delicious. Everyone but my fella chose the key lime pie to end the meal, while my fella chose chocolate cake. The key lime pie was extremely tart and delicious. The addition of pop rocks to the top was incredibly interesting. Tasty at first, but got tiring as you continue eating it. The molten chocolate cake was pretty good, but absolutely typical and not extremely exciting.   Overall, I was extremely happy with the conclusion to Restaurant Week 2011. My entire party was incredibly full and happy from our night out.",

Atmosphere was dim and romantic with a trendy edge. The wait staff was super helpful with the menu and helped us pick out delish items to try.   We had the seafood platter to start and it was fresh and alive with the flavor of the sea! I chose lobster for my entree. It was HUGE and cooked perfectly. My husband went for a entire cow (24oz porterhouse) and every bite was succulent, tasty, and tender. The bone marrow side dish tasted just like butter! And finally the lobster mash was delectable and had actual pieces of lobster in it!   To top it off...the hotel...and I do not how- found out it was our one year anniversary and gave us a warm chocolate molten cake on the house for the special occasion.   All in all- a great, yummy, and fantastic dinner!",

    "text": "Went to Jean Georges while staying at Aria for the Microsoft Lync conference. This was a truly great experience. We had a party of 8 without reservations, and as with all high end places, had to go through the rigmarole of them checking to see if they could fit us in, even though once we were sat there were empty seats everywhere. It's on the very high end price-wise, so I'm sure this drives away a lot of folks.  The atmosphere inside is very chill - very low lighting, dark woods, and some cool art features on the walls. There is an impressive wall of wine at the back of the restaurant. So after a short wait, we were seated and a host of different servers started attending to us. For their drink menu, they use a custom iPad app to allow you to scroll through the various drink menus and wine list. Cool concept, but since you can't view everything at once like you would normally on a menu, you have to use a filter/search function which was not built well. A regular menu would probably save a lot of time. With that said, we eventually found a couple bottles to our liking.   Their specialty is steak, and this is what everyone in our party ordered. They have some really over-the-top options as you would expect. The special of the night was a wagyu steak at $209 - no one touched this one. On the menu itself, the most expensive was the porterhouse at $109. I ended up going with the 16 oz dry aged ribeye at $66. One of the guys had the standard 18 oz ribeye at $62 which I sampled for comparison. If I ever go again, I'll opt for this one instead of the dry aged. Though the dry aged is bit more tender from the grass-fed beef and contained less marbling, it just wasn't as juicy and flavorful as the standard one from what I tasted. Sides were also very good. I like frites with my steak, and theirs were great.   They did brutalize one of the guy's steaks. He had ordered it mid-rare and it was quite well done. That seemed very unusual - we assumed the server grabbed someone else's plate as everyone else's were spot on with the temperature. What put the meal over the top in my opinion was the accompaniment of sauces. Each steak comes with a salsa verde sauce which was phenomenal. Then our server also brought out all of the other 4 sauces you can order from the menu. This is the way to go - try them all - very unique and adds some great flavoring to the steak.",

    "text": "I decided to hit up Vegas to celebrate my Master's Degree graduation.  I hand-picked restaurants with much debate on where to celebrate for sushi and steak.  I've had steak plenty of times in Vegas, on and off the strip and every restaurant I've been to (so far) has been amazing.  Well, until I came to Jean George.    People on yelp are NOT joking or being rude saying that the customer service is terrible, because it is.  I was in a party of 8, one big table in the corner with a great view, and we had 2 servers. You would think with TWO servers we would be well taken cared of. Totally no the case.  Our two servers were never at our table.  IT took us almost 30 minutes to order, and when we finally could wave someone down, they were rude about it.  We noticed too, that when we said no to wine, we got a \"uh ok..\" and did we see our waitERS after that? nope.  Not until we had to pay.  Our waiters gave us this \"you have to inconvenience me AGAIN\" attitutde? it made our experience so horrible.  Isn't this supposed to be fine dining? then why was my bread and butter literally THROWN onto our table? it was a bit shocking, really.  So the food finally came (mind you this was a sunday night and the restaurant was NOT packed), and it wasn't anything to rave about.  I've had better steak elsewhere (Prime, Strip Steak, Ruth Chris, Golden Steer,etc), and the sides were OK.  If you do decide to dine here, the bone marrow was good, just a little too red, and the truffle mash potatoes were good but overwhelming (also, our waitress didn't tell us that upgrading to the truffle mash, which was NOT on the menu, that it was an extra $8, or that our side of blue cheese would be extra).  Sans good service and food, I will not be stopping by this restaurant again.  It was a horrible experience, with rude staff, and not impressive food.  I'm going back to Strip Steak.",

    "text": "my boyfriend had made reservations for our four year anniversary here as a surprise. i never really been to a high end steakhouse before so it was def. a great experience and change.  our reservations were at 7pm on august 9th, my bf planned it that way so that we would be in time for our 9:30PM showing at Zarkana. were about 10 mins late to our reservations since the tram and foot traffic during that time took awhile. i was a bit worried they wouldnt take us in but luckily they were nice about it.   my first impression on the decor and ambience was def that \"oohh this mighty fancy smancyyy!\" it def gave off that romantic feel and since the lights and decor was on the darker side..it gave it more sexy appeal to it...like mhmm youre getting some you know what after tonights dinner ;) HAHAHA! dont lie, you guys know its True!   anywho, i am beyond surprised, grateful, and amazed by the staff especially our waitors, doris and boris (i know it rhymes...we were wondering if they were paired up together on purpose lol). they were both amazingly nice, funny, courteous, and all around great! im always a bit hesistant to come into fine establishments like this because even if we do have money to spend..most places tend to age discriminate us because of our age and assumption that we cannot afford it. so i am def. am grateful they didnt do that to us.  service again from doris and boris to the servers were definitely personable and incredibly nice. it was a bit weird they every server that came by came to keep refilling our waters constantly haha. i mean its nice but it was almost every sip we took lol. doris and boris suggested a good amount of plates..and we decided on getting the 12 oz ribeye for my bf, the 8oz filet migon for myself, shared the tomatoe/mozarella salad, and mac cheese/truffle side plate.  everything we ordered was amazingly except the salad since it wasnt even a salad..it was more of a 2 slices of tomatoes and some cheese...like not a leaf or greens ..i wouldnt even called it a salad honestly lol. so just skip that if youre thinking about it...but everything from the meats to the mac/truffle side plate..was YUMMY! our fave sauce was the green pesto that came with our meats and the miso butter sauce.  just when we were waiting for our check or for either doris or boris to come by after we finished our meals..a server came by and dropped off a dessert plate in front of us...i thought he had sent it to the wrong table b/c we didnt order any lol. The plate had ice cream with a candied caramel decoration and a warm chocolate molten lava cake...with a handwritten \"happy anniversary\" in chocolate..it was a TOTAL SURPRISE to my boyfriend and i. i even asked my bf if he had told them to that but he didnt..he just mentioned that it was our anniversary on the reservation though. i think my bf was lying haha ;)   overall, i would def go here again. i think a lot of people have their own strong opinions of places so if youre thinking about taking a risk..then you should def do it with jean georges! service is impeccable, food was delicious and they def treat you like a king and queen. i am so thankful they made our night even more special with that surprise dessert. i give it a thumbs up!",

    "text": "I had always thought  that Craftsteak is the best steakhouse before i visited Jean Goerges.  I had such a great experience at this place i would really recommend it to everyone who visits Las Vegas. I like everything here from the ambiance, the service, to the food.    The dishes are exciting, amusing, and just dances on your tastebuds.  The chef (Robert Moore, former executive chef at Prime, Bellagio), creates dishes that really allow the quality of the ingredients to stand out. The presentation of the creations here are both elegant and rustic without being overly extravagant, inviting you to savor every bite.  We shared the salt and pepper sweetbreads and crispy shrimp for appetizers and they were both delicious.  I had the filet mignon and it was just as good as it gets.  The black truffle and comte fritter side dish was real fun and delicious the same time. I do not recollect the taste of the sauces that came with the steak...i believe by that point of the dinner my senses got carried away to the clouds with the champagne.  A highly recommended steakhouse indeed ;)",

    "text": "Restaurant Week Menu   - Romaine And Arugula Salad | Avocado And Spicy Corn Vinaigrette Small serving size was my first impression of this appetizer, but then at a steak house you dont really go for the salads.   Not a lot of Avocado, i recall noticing about two or three chunks. A little more avocado would have been nice but with the serving size one extra chunk would have done it but three chunks would have been too much avocado.   The vinaigrette had a pronounced spicy kick to it. I had forgotten it was even suppose to be spicy as i was interested in this only because i'm a huge fan of arugula. In the end it complemented the salad quite nicely as the sweetness of heirloom cherry sized tomatoes balanced it out quite nicely.   - Grass Fed Paso Prime New York Strip | Smokey Tomato Compote, Herbal Spinach And Crunchy Potato The smokey tomato compote was excellent, just truly excellent. What ever it touched it gave off a sweet yet smokey tomato flavor; with the steak: totally awesome! with the crunchy potato: hey you got adult fries and ketchup! with the spinach very nice indeed. I'd love to have a jar of this stuff so i can eat it with anything.  To be honest, i didnt taste anything herbal about the herbal spinach at all. It was just a hair on the salty side and tasted like any cooked spinach side with just a bit of garlic to it. Nothing special but nothing holding it back either.   The NY Strip was a very uniformed cut and didnt look like any traditional NY Strip i commonly see. There was no strip of tendon and fat on the sides which was unfortunate for me as i do enjoy the tendon, gives it a chewy texture which is nice when the cuts are on the large or thick side. The quality of the steak was superb as well as the requested temperature, which was medium rare btw. Overall seasonings could have been improved. There was nothing about this steak that impressed me or made the dining experience worth it other than it being of a much higher upscale restaurant grade cut.   - Warm Chocolate Cake | Vanilla Ice Cream Nothing really stood out from this dessert. It's basically your average chocolate cake that's still runny in the middle served with ice cream. Nothing special, nothing just jumps up and wows you.   I see restaurant week as an opportunity as a local to try out restaurants i normally dont even consider going to. If you're a tourist or not a Las Vegas local reading this review then i urge you to ignore everything i typed and go here, you'll have a great time. In my prospective, the only item that was served that Truely wowed me was the smokey tomato compote. Everything else i give credit to the establishment for having quality ingredients and talented staff but the bang to buck ratio did not meet my expectations.  Yelp 100 - 042 of 100",

    "text": "Is Jean George the best restaurant in the Aria? No way! Is it solid compared to some of its neighbors? Oh yes!  I came in for my birthday with some friends from out of town. We came in for a late dinner and was taken care of with meticulous hospitality.   To start we ordered the oysters rockafeller and the crab cake. The portion sizes are not large. It is just a taste. Both were sensational. They were running a special on an Australian bone in 30 ounce ribeye which is raised similar to wagyu. We got one of those and their regular ribeye off the menu to compare. The marbling and tenderness of the Australian definitely stood out. It warranted the price as well. The sides were a letdown though. The mushrooms in goat cheese and bone marrow were not outstanding. The latter was underwhelming in the fact that it was so sparse. There was hardly anything to scoop up. The garlic spread that accompany it was the highlight. The pairing was intended to cut the rich fattiness of the bone marrow. Instead I used it for the ribeyes with the same intention.  Now this is where it got crazy. As the servers heard my friends wish me a happy birthday John G. prepared for a tour of the restaurant. After that we had to try some desserts. We got the churros with three different dipping sauces; strawberry, chocolate, and dulce de leche. It was good on its own or with the last sauce. The lava cake is JG's specialty. Apparently he came up with this signature dessert. It was the perfect portion. I could not see eating anything bigger. The strawberry rhubarb cobbler with pistachio ice cream is out of this world. The lattice work on top is gorgeous and every component meshed together well. Then there was the caramel sundae with the best caramel corn. The popcorn is served warm and it contrasts so well to the cold ice cream. I was on a sugar high and loving it.   I might not have been blown away by everything, but it was a solid dinner.",

Yes, I know, a good steak just needs a pat of butter but I like steak sauces and there are many classics that good French restaurants serve, most based on reduced brown sauce.

First off, the waiter and servers were very accommodating. They were very sweet and even congratulated us on our anniversary. They gave us so much time to make our minds up on the menu and to talk to one another. I really wasn't used to that.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and I ordered the salmon while he ordered the filet mignon.   The calamari was way better than I expected. It was not greasy and the sauce was to die for. It had the texture of tartar sauce, but with a chipotle spicy taste. I was not expecting that at all. It was so good. Drool!  I was very happy with my salmon. It was lightly seasoned on a bed of mashed potatoes. Something about mashed potatoes at a fancy restaurant. They always seem to taste better than the kind at KFC. hehe The vegetables were crisps and nicely salted. Let's just say I was very stuffed at the end of the meal.   My fiance enjoyed his filet mignon as well, but he was sad he didn't get the 12 ounce instead of the 8 ounce. Overall I would say that it was a great place for our anniversary. The atmosphere was very cozy and the service was just excellent as well as the food.",

We have been sampling the best that Las Vegas has to offer in food for years, even before we lived here we would come for extended periods on business. I have tried a number of steakhouses in town, and JG at the Aria is easily one of the very best. We have tried the Short Rib, the fritters, the Tomahawk steak, the burger, and more.Everything we have had has been fantastic. The wine list is exceptional, and our experience with the service has been very good as well. I will go back, whenever I am ready for a really special meal.",

I walked in and got a cool table where I could watch all the gorgeous eye candy walk in.  The decor of the restuarant is soooo sexy...........the low-dimmed lights, comfortable seats, hip-hop music and all the hot babes walking in their 5 inch heels........I could just sit here and hang out all night and not eat a thing.  I started off the meal with the cream of tomato soup.  It was the best tomato soup that I have ever had.....just enough cream to make it rich and creamy......it came with a tasty chedder cheese garlic toast.  The bread basket was also very tasty.....pretzel bread, sour dough, parmesean cheese flat bread  and a cherry pecan bread that made the basket super delicious.  For dinner, I had the rib-eye steak and a side of their famous black truffled comte cheese fritter.  My bone-in rib eye steak came out perfect..........tender, full of flavor and just the right amount of fat.  The side of the comte fritter was awesome....it came with 4 dipping sauces and really made the flavor of the steak come out.....think a deep fried cheese ball.  For desert, I had the baba rum cake....it came with pineapples and caramel ice cream.  The rum cake was warm.....it tasted delicious with the pineapple slices and caramel flavored ice cream.  Overall....it a great dining experience.  The food, hot, high heeled babes and the sexy atmosphere made the meal wonderful........I came again in my pants...sooooo satisfying.",

    "text": "Jean Georges, I have been waiting to try you and finally got my chance last night. We had a 7 pm reservation for Saturday evening and were running a little bit late. My husband called to let them know and they were very accomodating.   We arrived and were seated right away. Our first waiter came out with the menus and the wine/cocktail list. I started out with a twist on a lemon drop and husband started out with a glass of scotch.   They brought out a selection of bread but I only really tried the pretzel bread because it my absolute favorite. It was delicious and nice and soft.  We decided to go with two appetizers, the tuna tartare and the crab crostini. The crab crostini was to die for. Two crostinis loaded with dungeness crab mixture with a light dill flavor. The tuna tartare was a classic take and was very good.   For the main entree we ordered the tomahawk chop which was a waygu/kobe beef hybrid. We also ordered the fritters, the mashed potatoes and the bone marrow and toast.   The fritters were so good. They were perfectly fried, and nice and creamy in the middle with a spicy goodness from the jalapeano and cheese combo.  The bone marrow was really good! I had always wanted to try it and I liked it although on one of them, I couldnt get the marrow out, so that was a little disappointing.   The mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with a good flavor. But had a little bit of a sticky texture.   Now to the main reason JG's is getting four-stars instead of five. The tomahawk chop. This steak was 26 oz for $95 bucks. Hubby and I decided to share it.  As soon as it came out I was wishing we had choosen something else. First of all, a lot of the 26 oz came from the huge bone. Ok, I can get over that. The waitress described the cut as very flavorful because it is marbled with fat. I didn't get that. I got huge pieces of fat on the end and the meat didnt seem too marbled. It was good but it was not great for $100. I was glad they served it with sauces cause honestly it was not overly flavorful. The people at the table next to us had the porterhouse and the filet and I was jealous.   My husband has another glass of scotch and I had a glass of shiraz.   The atmosphere was great and modern but the music was a little too loud. There was a photographer walking around and he took some really good pictures of us. I was kicking myself for not getting one this morning but I never asked how much they were cause he came back during a bad time during our meal.   Overall our meal was really good, the atmosphere was nice and romantic, the cocktails were good and the service was excellent.   I would like to come back again and try a few more things on the menu but it will have to be after we have tried some of the other steakhouses in Vegas.",

I dare you to try and get out of here spending less than $40 per person (good luck).",

We were a party of 4. How difficult can it be? One member of our party my 80 year old mother who was celebrating her birthday.  A female took over our table towards the end of the evening and she was great.   The fixed price menu posted on the website was not actual. The new menu was $20.00 higher and not even close to what some guest may be expecting.  $20.00 isn't the point; it is the inaccurate information on the site.   Again; snarky servers just don't cut it and I don't care what city in the world one is dining.  Note to Jean Georges.  Think about why your establishment was almost dead empty on a Friday night?  The food is great; the people working your tables are below standard.   I felt as though they thought it was them doing me a favour by dining in your restaurant.",

The restaurant is pretty cool, one of those trendy fancy dimly lit modern music type feels to it. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server, and he soon brought us a bevy of different breads - sourdough rolls, pretzels, this flat bread thingy, etc. I ordered the 24oz Porter (still in that go big or go home Vegas mentality) medium rare, but it came out medium. The other people I was with both got the 6oz Wagu Filet from Australia, and that came out absolutely perfect and was basically melt in your mouth tender.  Steaks come with 4 sauces on the side (house steak, soy miso, i forget the other two) which are nice, but I'm more of a steak salt and pepper kinda guy, esp if I'm paying premium prices for it.  Overall it was a pretty nice place to have a steak, not my favorite by any means but a pretty chill place if you're around that end of Vegas/Aria.",

Bread also good - as were salads.  I was thinking this place was great.  But when my $87 Australian bone in strip steak arrived - it was extremely rare and was really lacking in flavor.  No one checked on us.  The sides were below average - truffle Mac and Cheese was tasteless and creamed spinach was flavorless and so non-creamy I suspected it was sauteed.  Finally had to ask a busboy to get our server (on a slow Thursday) to send back my steak.  Came back closer to medium (pink) - but steak was still less flavorful that any high end Vegas steakhouse (Smith and Wollensky, Mesa Grill, Cut, Craftsteak, Joe's, Old Homestead) I've tried.  Plus it took too long.  Desert was good, and the modest Cote de Rhone we had was decent.  Still at $420 with tip for 2 -I expect excellence.  This wasn't close.",

I didn't know what to expect when first walking up to the restaurant, but the second I walked in I knew I was going to be paying for the ambiance and decor. It was very dark and trendy, clearly setup to impress..  I made no reservation but that didn't seem to matter, the hostess was helpful and didn't make us wait long at all..The waiter here was polite and helpful with his recommendations..He was attentive and made sure my date and I were satisfied with our visit.  I'm a steak guy, I saw the waygu steak cut and knew I had to try it, it was good and prepared perfectly..Not sure it was worth it but definitely good..Wasn't too impressed with their appetizer options. Overall food was 4/5.  Now I don't know if this is a regular thing here but they had a photographer taking pictures, he approached us and decided to put on a photo shoot..It was a bit much and asked for poses, bit annoying when trying to enjoy a peaceful dinner..But in the end we ended up buying a photo for memories, so it wasn't so bad, just needed to be toned down a bit.  I'd say this place is in the top 20 of restaurants I've ate at in Las Vegas.",

Definitely situated in one of the best places at Aria.  This place definitely looks very hip and sheik  and the food is definitely off the hook.   Bridget our server.... How can I tell you this without sounding rude, I have gotten better service at Denny's.    One of the reason's why I didn't rate this higher is for the simple details:   When ordering the 5 main course option, make sure you get #2 to the right table not the couple next to us.    Next check in, when we pay for these 95 dollar plates we want a smile and the ever so cheesy \"how was your tartare?\" It just makes us feel warm and fuzzy that you pretend to care.    Lastly how about you swap out the silver ware throughout the course so my fork isn't tasting like avocado when I am eating my scallop's. Foul!   Oh yeah then there's the pictures guy, really? Who the hell is this gypsy selling pictures and trying to up sell you pictures when you are trying to enjoy a great dish... Really?  Outside of these slightly foul balls, I would definitely give this place another shot and will probably ask for another server.  The steaks btw are damn good, they have a good wine selection with several by the glass options that are very delightful.",

Ambiance and decor wise is to personal taste... ymmv.  After reading about some of the service issues from other reviews, i believe my wife and i got lucky because our waiter was just the nicest nicest guy ever and the other servers never let my water glass sit at less than half empty. So 5 stars for service from me.  The non red meat food.... 4-5 stars  Started with Soup du Jour... escapes my memory what it was exactly but something with lobster. Lobster bisque has been en vogue for a while now but i remember actually enjoying this version.  Peekytoe Crabcake... on the regular menu and very very good. All crab meat cake without much else. The grapefuit and ginger sauce went well with the crab while the avacado smoothed the overall texture.  Maine Lobster... also off the regular menu. Almost like an Asian stir-fry. My wife very much enjoyed it and the brussel sprouts were done to perfection. Brussel sprouts not done correctly can kill a dish.  The beef... 3 stars  24oz Porterhouse... ordered it medium rare. came out more on the rare side but i can enjoy some bloody meat so it was fine. But overall a bit chewy all around. The filet side was not overcooked but felt the quality of meat a bit frustrating for the supposed level of the steakhouse.  In Vegas, better can be had at Delmonico's or even Joe's Seafood at Caesar's Palace.  Quite a letdown... only salvaged but its other offerings and service.",

The restaurant was not decorated in the normal steakhouse design. They have cool images of a cow's nose running throughout the place. It was cool and dark with a modern edge.   The service started out stellar and continued that way. We had two servers for our table of two. They were very knowledgeable and quick to respond to our needs. They provided great recommendations for food. The sommelier was good. I felt she got a good feel for what we were looking for and provided a good bottle.   We started out with drinks and I heard no complaints. I had the cucumber-gin drink. A little sweet, but still really good.   We got 3 starters to share; grilled foie gras, rice cracker tuna and a mozzarella dish.   The foie gras was good. I can see why people like it. butter and rich with a smokey flavor, thanks to the grill.   The mozzarella dish was nice and simple. The cheese was amazing. It was a Caprese salad with out being one.   The tuna was a hit. Crispy outside and perfectly rare in the middle. My wife is not a huge seafood fan and really enjoyed it. The sriracha mayo with it was perfect. They serve jalapeno crackers with the bread dish. We all tried it with the tuna and it was better than what it was served with. We told the waiter and he said he had been telling the chef the same thing.   I had the lamb chops. Perfectly cooked medium rare and seasoned well. The green peppery sauce was a great accompaniment.   My wife and her friend split the chicken dish. The really liked it and I got a taste. It was pretty damn good for a simple chicken dish.   Our other friend got a fish plate, I think it was the sea bass. I shared my lamb, which was a hard thing to do, for some fish. Not as good as the lamb, but good.   We also had the broccoli rapini and the mashed blue cheese potatoes. I can't speak for everyone on the rapini, but I like it. The potatoes on the other hand, we fought over who got to lick the cast iron dish it can in! They were, to me, the best thing on the table.   What a great place for any occasion.",

    "text": "After have a \"taste\" at Sage, we continued our journey to Julian Serrano for part two of our tasting tour of Aria. We had to stand around and wait for a hostess at Julian Serrano that never came. In a resort casino with plenty of other high-end restaurants willing to take our money, we left and wandered upstairs to try Jean George (located on the second floor above the casino next to Sirio and Michael Mina) which promptly assisted us.  Obviously, we skipped appetizers and went straight into the main course which was a $90 steak special - the Wagyu-like Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed). It was an embarrassing piece of meat. The steak lacked everything you'd expect in a cut of beef. It missed flavor, fattiness, and tenderness.  Then there were the steak sauces. I'm a purist who believes a steak sauce needed for bad, flavorless steaks. A really good steak is perfection on its own. Even though the tomahawk was heavily seasoned and charred to create flavor, five different steak sauces were served. This isn't McDonald's or Chik-Fil-A where customers have a choice of dipping sauces for the chicken nuggets. The chef should make a decision and pick one sauce that fits the flavor profile of their cuisine. Instead, it was a colorful Benetton nation of sauces with an airy French hollandaise, a bright and refreshing Mexican salsa verde, an overly sweet BBQ sauce, a super-hot southwestern scotchbonnet, and a mellow Asian tamarind. Aside from the BBQ sauce, they were all expertly executed, but none were good matches with the steak.  The sides were thankfully small and a decent-sized for one person. We tried two sides. The Brussels sprouts with pear and bacon had a forceful zing. By itself, the sprouts were dry and not very exciting, but the acidity helped contract the fattiness of beef. The mushrooms with goat cheese polenta were a disaster. This was the second greasy and overcooked polenta I had that night. The mushrooms were sadly dried-out and tough.  The Mollydooker South Australian Shiraz by the glass was a very nice wine and well suited for the evening.  For dessert, we had a glass of Moscati di Asti that was a fine match with the cinnamon creme brulee with cocoa nibs and figs on the bottom. The use of cinnamon in a brulee is a very smart decision. I can't believe other chefs haven't done this. It seems like a completely obvious combination, but I guess when something is that obvious, it's easy not to think of it.",

However, this Vegas Steakhouse is fantastic and I would go here over the other Vegas Steakhouses any day.  I started off with my standard Caesar salad.   Hard to screw up (though some places manage to!) but there are various ways to make it notable (see my Strip House review).  Many places use big, thin fresh cuts of parmesan but Jean Georges takes a different tack.  The parmesan is grated so small and light that it literally seems fluffy and melts immediately on the tongue.  NICE.  Next was the sweetbreads.  If a chef is willing to serve this, he knows his stuff, and these were cooked in an extremely (and mercifully) light sesame truffle sauce.  Very good, and a nice change from typical steakhouse fare.  Normally I like to go for the filet, but when I see a soy-glazed short rib, I have to have it.  It's literally a compulsion.  I can get a great filet any time in NYC, and I'm glad I went with the short rib because it was amazing.  I think even better than the short rib at BLT prime because of the soy glaze.  Served up with a side of creamed spinach and a glass of South Australian Shiraz, it really hits the spot.",

NIce, plump juicy big shrimp wrapped in bacon with the perfect bite of saltiness from the bacon.  I almost done wet my pants bfore my steak arrived.  Next came my 18 ounce rib eye...Insane amount of food.  They were very nice to offer 2 complimentary sauces on the side.  I highly recommend the Homemade Hot Sauce.   We also go thte Soy-Miso Butter which was also good.  I like to eat my steak plain usually but it was nice to alternate bites between the sauces.  In addition to the pre-fix, we also ordered the Black Truffle Mash Potatoes - SITM \"S3X in the Mouth\" alert!!!  I can't stop raving about this place.  If you're looking for a fine dining LV strip steak house, check this place out.   If i was ballen in the mix, I'd be up here all the time!",

I was staying at Vdara and made reservations at Jean Georges through their concierge, but when me and my friends got there for our reservation, they said they couldn't find my reservation. When they tried \"looking\" for it they just had the deer in headlights look. Not to mention they where just stuck up a-holes.  But looking at their reviews for this place, I'm glad they lost my reservation. Shoddy service and long waits. Eghww.",

The reason for 3 stars: The service was EXTREMELY slow even though the restaurant didn't seem full at all, but then again, when you're paying top $$$ for dining experience the service needs to be on point.... this wasn't the case. We had to flag down our waiter a few times... and towards the end it became somewhat unbearable.  I had sea bass, while it was cooked to perfection, the sauce on top was a bit too salty, the veal steak was a bit too salty as well :-/  This dining experience does not justify $110/pp . Not sure if I'll be returning to Jean George's in Las Vegas...",

    "text": "We found Jean Georges by walking through the Aria.  The menu looked good, so we called to make a reservation!  The restaurant is beautiful and has a lot of darker curved lines through the decor.  Very modern but comfortable.  Our dinner consisted of: Bacon Wrapped Shrimp w/ papaya Mustard, Cilantro Butternut Squash Soup w/Ginger and Basil Baby Iceberg Lettuce w/Blue Cheese Dressing Crispy Bacon Salt and Pepper Maine Lobster w/ Ginger and Scallions Buttery Cabbage Soy-Glazed Short Rib w/Apple-Jalapeno Puree & Rosemary Crumbs Salted Caramel Ice Cream Sundae w/Peanuts, Popcorn & Chocolate Sauce  The only downside: the soup and salad were too big!!!  (a rare complaint for fine dining)  We were trying to save room for desert, and had to take some of the entrees back to the hotel.  (the desert was WELL WORTH IT)  Also there's a gentleman who goes around offering to take table-side photos for quite a high price (we heard the couple at the table next to us.  one large photo and two small for $75!! )  I've never been a fan of being disturbed during dinner- though to be fair, he asked once and then left us alone after we declined.   The upside- the flavors were so delicious!  Also, prices for the main dishes were super reasonable.  My lobster dish had two tails, and was only $42!  Very much worth it.  Our server was polite, as were the waiters clearing our plates and filling our waters.  We fell in love with their pretzel bread, and they were kind enough to pack some to go so we could enjoy it later on our trip.    Certainly a good bet :)",

Some of the other sides were just OK - the truffle potatoes were super heavy.  I had some pretty bad meals in Vegas (all restaurants in the Wynn), so this one was the best I had.  I wasn't paying, either, which made the high prices unimportant.  BTW, I think the cow face outline decor is weird.",

    "text": "My family and I ordered the fixed menu for dinner for 4 people.  The highlight of the menu was the tuna tartare, which was light and beautifully prepared.  The scallops were tasty, but slightly salty for our tastes... lime wedges are a must to cut down their intensity.  The filet mignon main course was mixed-bag: the sesame seed sauce was delicious, but the meat was over-seasoned, extremely salty.  In addition, the chef-de-cuisine's choice of ending the menu with a classic lava cake was disappointingly dull.  It lacked any of the NY restaurant's Iuzzini's flair.  Overall, I had a better than average meal.  Service-wise, the restaurant falters, hindered mostly by a robotic waiter who just recited the course and a pair of hostile front hostesses who were unable to soldier a smile or pretend to be happy to see us even though the restaurant was nearly empty during dinner hours.  I suspect the qualification to work here is to hate all life and happy things, especially puppies.  If you are in the area with a steak crave, I'd recommend Gallagher's over at New York, New York.  If you want a tasting menu, Joel Robuchon's 4-course or 6-course meal is a far superior experience.",

While it may not be the best steakhouse in Vegas (theres so many to choose from), if your around Aria, It's  worth checking out. I enjoyed my meal and finished every last morsel. Maybe I'm just easy to please with steak. It seems that most people have a problem with the service and the price rather than the food itself.",

Jean Georges has overextended his Boyardee-like empire; this Vegas stand simply is a reflection of a lack of quality and control in what should be a simple ode to the great american steakhouse.  Waiters are helpful in directing you AWAY from the dry aged rib eye; which is a poor Choice cut (REALLY??); to the slightly less insipid prime rib eye; a butter-soaked disaster of a steak. The Wagyu fares no better; with poorly sourced meat sadly charred on a plate with a quaint plastic marrow bone holding a faux asian sauce to mask the taste of a cheaply procured; poorly cooked piece of meat. The creamed spinach is a bowl of rancid cream with spinach fragments - inedible.  Save your time and money and go to Serrano, the only restaurant in the Aria that gives a damn. This is insulting and pathetic - the only redeeming factor was the strong martini that kept me happy enough to suffer through this sorry excuse of a meal.  DON'T EAT HERE.",

Bernaise, JG Sauce (which was like a BBQ sauce) and 3rd sauce (can't remember what kind) which was spicier. All 3 sauces were really good but my top choice was the bernaise. The brussell sprouts were phenomenal. They were crunchy and came with pears which were a nice combination. I would return just for the b sprouts. I don't know that I'd return for the NY strip but there are other good looking options. The $100 credit was the catalyst as to why I visited. The service was really good and the food was great. I would return, especially with another resort credit.",

The bone marrow is succulent, the steaks, to die for. We suggest combining the miso butter sauce with the spicy habanero sauce for the right amount of kick and savoriness. Just stellar food and experience.",

    "text": "First off, I came here for a business meeting on a Tuesday night without any resos.  The place was packed so we waited about an hour or so, which shows how much Vegas is hurting right?  This place is a big restaurant with a very nice ambiance.  No complaints here on that front.  We had a table of 5 and everyone ordered different things.  Although everything was good, nothing was great.  My short ribs were ok, definitely not even close to the best i've ever had, that's for sure.  I think it had to do with the flavoring perhaps??  Mashed potatoes were good, as was the wedge salad.  Service was spot on and drinks were good and strong.  All around, 3 to 3.5 stars but with all the steak houses in Vegas, you may want to try another.",

    "text": "To begin, the staff was extremely attentive, while not being intrusive. Only drawback was a bit of a constant sell to buy more items (side dishes, etc.).     We arrived for a 9:45P reservation on Friday night (New Years Day), had a round of Caipirinhas, which were excellent (and potent), then were promptly escorted to a corner table for our party of 5. The decor was modern and warm, but not wow-ing.     We ordered the following appetizers: 1) Fresh Oysters: Decent oysters, not off the San Francisco peer or anything, but good nonetheless. Garlic/vinegar sauce was nice to go with. 2) Sweet Breads: My first time trying these, therefore no real comparison on quality. I enjoyed this dish.  Entrees: Steaks (of course) Porterhouse Steak: Probably one of the best cuts I've had in a long time. A generous portion of fillet, to go along with a good looking New York strip, this porterhouse was only simply seasoned and cooked perfectly. The porterhouse was a 24 oz. cut/$60. I would highly recommend this dish.  Rib-Eye:    Others in my group had bone-in rib-eye steaks which they thoroughly enjoyed (as revealed through the shiny bone left on the plate when finished), also simply seasoned. As a further note, instead of traditional market steakhouses, freshly made in-house sauces were prepared. Each was interesting and added to the experience, however, nothing really added more than enjoying the steak as is, simply seasoned.     The downside of the experience at this restaurant came with the side dishes. The portion per side dish sparingly served two people and was extremely pricey for the quality of the side dish. For example, I believe 7 pieces of asparagus with a bit of garlic and lemon cost $14 per plate. Servings of mashed potatoes were small as well. The side dish of mushrooms was excellent, but also quite small. Honestly, I was expecting the restaurant to be less stingy with these dishes.      As for dessert, we had a run of the mill chocolate lava cake and a really interesting, delicious japanese citrus and white chocolate sorbet. This dessert was a nice combination of sour and sweet and was unlike any sorbet I've had before. Unfortunately I forgot the name of the fruit that was used.  Overall, not including drinks, the dinner came to ~80/person.",

We got chicken samosas as an appetizer, being Indian I was skeptical about samosas at a steak house.  They were $12 for two pieces, but it was one of the best samosas I ever had.  For dinner I ordered the chicken and a side of mashed potatoes.  They only had fried chicken, not grilled, which was a bit disappointing, but it was really good.  The batter was well flavored and chicken was cooked just right.  They brought out a bunch of different sauces for us to try and their hot sauce was on point.  The mashed potatoes...  lets just say it was worth all 1200 pennies.  It melted like butter in your mouth.  My friends who ordered the steaks were just as happy with their meals.  We were so full we skipped out on dessert.  The meal without alcohol came out to $75pp, but that was expected at a high end steak house.  The service was comparable to the prices they were charging, they definitely deserved their tip!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Jean Georges and it gets come back player of the year award!  My first dining experience was almost exactly a year to the day and was a rather sub par experience.  However, this time around it could not have been a better dinner for my client and I.    The restaurant is quite beautiful and has a great vibe.  We started with cocktails which came very fast and were quite good.  We also ordered a bottle of wine and had the Sommelier decant it.  Upon opening the bottle and pouring a tasting amount in the glass, he quickly took it away and stated it was not up to standard for that wine.  We had not even tasted it when he took it and brought a new bottle of the same wine and vintage.  We did end up tasting both and while the bottle he took away was not bad, it was not up to the same level as the replacement bottle. Major kudos for that!   I ordered the burrata cheese and tomato appetizer, which was delicious and my client ordred the Caesar salad.  For our main entrees, I ordered the Dry Aged bone-in  NY and my client ordered the Wagyu Filet.  We decided to share them family style and neither disappointed.   The Dry aged NY was outstanding but did not shine as well as the Wagyu - not a complete surprise considering it was Wagyu.  Our side dish was french fries with truffle and parmesan - also quite good.    The service was excellent.  All staff working our table were very polite and friendly and very attentive.  Never had to make a single request!  Overall, this was a fantastic dining experience.  I will have to chalk up my prior experience to being an \"off night\" for Jean Georges.   I will definitely be back!  A simple tip for those after dinner - do not stop at the craps tables!!  A quick way to ruin an otherwise excellent evening.",

I heard a lot of good things about the Jean George in New York and was hoping that this would be a similar experience. The ambiance was great, a typical steakhouse, a little more elegant than StripSteak in Vegas but nothing over the top.  we decided on the 6 course prefixe for 125.00 pp. so we can get a little-of-this-and-a-little-of-that. I never done a prefix at a steakhouse b/c i'm usually just dialed in which 'cut' i want more and maybe a side of lobster mac'n'cheese so this was a good deviation.   * OSETRA CAVIAR - soooo good, i wanted another round of this..a bit of tart w/ salty goodness * TUNA TARTARE - pretty standard tartare - does the job * AUTUMN FRUITS - burrata cheese - not a fan * SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS - really good, had a small hint of asian flavors like the viet fish sauce * GRILLED WAGYU FILET MIGNON - amazing, i didnt expect that the tasting menu's steak would be so tender. had another touch of asian marinade flavors..loved this * PEANUT BUTTER BROWNIE SUNDAE - wayyyyyyyyyy toooo sweet and i love dessert and peanut butter but i felt a small heart clog with this...  well done Jean George!!!  until next time space cowboy....",

The second steak was still over cooked but edible although the cook was not an even cook and it had to much char on the outside.

Yes the manager came over to apologize but the experience and reputation had already been tarnished and I don't plan on dining there again.",

I had almost everything on the menu with my group and there is not one single thing that I wouldn't happily order again.  crab: good, sides: good, oysters: so good, lobster: delicious, pretzel bread: yum, steak: perfect...delicate blackened crust on the outside, perfectly cooked middles.  The sauces were all good, but unnecessary.  The vegetarian in our group was so excited for a meal at a steakhouse that was more than just honey coated carrots like everywhere else he'd been this week.    10/10, would eat again.",

The truffle mash was average and I guess the marrow is an acquired taste but not mine. On the plus side, the truffle mac and cheese was very tasty and the service was top of the line.",

The food was great in the pre-determined menu however a few of us described our Sea Bass as on the salty side. Appetizer of salad was okay, not great. Fresh bread was delicious. Main course was also okay but the best was the dessert. I surmise this is par for a group dinner and individual dinners would be above average which is why I subtracted a star.  With these prices, the fare could have been better.",

    "text": "Prefacing this review as slightly biased. At the price point of this restaurant, I'd expect higher standards and attention to detail. But this is the good and the bad of all of it.  Group of 6 of us were in town for a realtor's convention and were having a team celebration  Decor- beautiful decor. Clean restrooms. Glasses were well polished, although my silverware had looked like no one had even attempted to polish it. Appropriate glassware for every type of wine ordered  Service- Fantastic. My only qualm, was that the server never came back to ask if the temperatures on our steaks were correct(see later in the review. But we felt very accommodated and taken care of by all staff members.  Cocktails- Only one was ordered by myself. I ordered off menu with a classic negroni. How I start off most of my meals. Some restaurants serve these up, some on the rocks. But the standard here is up. It was perfect, and a really good measure of the 'bar' they set for the beverage program.  Wine- Excellent list. Lots to choose from in this excellently curated list. The house Somm came by to great us while I was drinking my cocktail, and offered his suggestion, but I told him i wanted to finish my cocktail but would love a suggestion for dinner. He said he would return, but never made his way back to us. Was happy with the glasses we chose and the bottle i selected.  Food- Apps: Tuna Tartare- phenomenal. I feel as if even the serving                       temperature was optimal and all flavors were perfectly                       balanced                      Ribs- Delicious. well cooked, fell off the bone.                       Oysters- Incredibly fresh. Shucked beautifully.                          Steaks- 3 out of 3 steaks were cooked to the appropriate                       temp. But I ordered the special bone in ribeye \"the one on                       the picture\" ordered medium rare, got closer to medium-                       well. Another ordered medium rare, her's was medium.                       Another ordered medium well, and got rare-plus. When the                       Steak was pushed away after 4 minutes, server came to                       ask if we everything was okay, took steak back for a cook                       up, came back medium-rare plus. And then he gave up.                       Issue was, no one ever asked if our steaks were cooked                       properly, im not sure if it was an assumption that they temp                      everything right. the steak sauces were delicious.                        Sides- Lobster Mashed potatoes were so decadent. Crispy                                  potatoes were perfect. Mushrooms were great.                                  Downside was, they were described as \"family                                  style\", but wasn't really the portion size im used to                                  seeing when receiving that description. But                                  nonetheless delicious                       Dessert- did not leave an impression at all  I'm not sure if it was an off night, but I was a bit underwhelmed by this place while spending $1500 pre-tip. Not even sure if the undercooked steak stayed on the bill as we weren't even will to pack it up after 2 failed attempts. Would consider giving this another try when I return in a few months as the service was excellent, but i can't say that it will be my first choice in destination.",

I love Wagyu, but since it was my hubby's birthday celebration I ordered with him and requested the 14oz Prime Rib (I will come back for the Wagyu). Both steaks were mouth watering!!! We will return.

    "text": "What happened?  Came here for an early New Year's eve dinner before seeing Bruno Mars at the T-Mobile Arena.  The great thing is that we parked at the Park MGM, walked to the Aria via the inside walkway and it was so easy and so convenient.  We had 5:00 pm reservations due to wanting to be at the ticket gate early.    Food - Boy oh boy, that milk bread that they serve with herbed butter is so amazing.  I loved this. The texture, the consistency of the bread was just right and that butter was awesome.  I think I would come here just fo this.  They did not have the brisket that they carve at your table, but I settled for my favorite Filet Mignon.  I did ask the waiter if I should have this or the Lamb Chops and he recommended the Filet.  At 8 oz, when it came out, this was the smallest Filet I have ever seen.  On the plate, it was almost ridiculous.  Taste was good, tender, cooked pink / medium rare and it is just that sometimes presentation counts a lot an to have such a small piece on a large plate was unappealing.  The other items was a serving of their Sauce Verde, a green sauce to accompany the steak.  The wife had a 16 oz bone in rib eye and I tasted some of this and it was very good.  They bring out four sauces besides the green sauce.  A bernaise sauce, Spicy habanero sauce, Soy Miso sauce and  their signature steak sauce that was like A-1.  none of these were really good at all, but I tried them all.  To me, they take away the flavor of the steak.  No dessert or appetizers tonight. We wanted to get to T-Mobile.  I was not impressed at all with their reservation system.  Yes, I made a reservation, everyone for 5:00 just waits outside.  Then you have to \"check in\" with the front desk.  After this, they then send out a person to take you to your table.  It took us about a full 20 minutes to get seated and you feel like you are \"lucky\" to be seated.  Me no likes this.  Also, I was getting annoyed when other people that checked in AFTER us were being called to be seated.  Man was I making up a bunch of thins about that.  The front desk people are not friendly, task oriented and are handling what I consider to be a most inefficient style of seating.  Now, to be fair, I will come back to try this place one more time.  The reviews of some Elite Yelpers make me want to come back. And, I want to come back hungry.  I would love to try some of the appetizers like the Tuna Tartare, or the Shellfish platter.  That Wagyu Carpaccio sounds amazing too.  But, that front desk service better be improved. There are plenty of other steak places to go to spend a lot of money!",

Great space, ambiance, volume levels, etc. Our party felt like the center of attention and our service was excellent. Reed and Joseph took amazing care of all our needs. One person in our party is a celiac and the restaurant was able to prepare an array of items on and off menu. That flexibility truly speaks to the quality and skill of the kitchen and staff. Jerry, the manager, checked-in on us and really helped make dinner very special.  The quality is what I expect from any fine steakhouse. Apps, sides, proteins were all prepared perfectly and accompanied with their signature sauces.  Our party tried and shared everything we could. I'd love to go on about each dish... Having a sweet tooth, dessert wins! We sure did.   Thanks to all!! I speak for my entire group when I say JGS goes to the top of the dinner list!",

Wagyu carpaccio: 5/5 it's a small portion but it was worth it. Carpaccio was tender and fresh. The sauce and garnish was well balanced as to not overpower the carpaccio.  Filet mignon 8oz: 2.5/5 WHAT WAS THIS?! IVE NEVER BEEN SO DISSAPOINTED WITH A FILET. it was overdone and wasnt even hot when it came out. The garnish that it came with was good but didnt fix the overdone chewy steak.  Wagyu filet 6oz: 4/5 so much better than their filet mignon. It was actually done medium rare as requested and tender   Lobster mashed potatos: 4/5 it was not too creamy and the lobster chunks were a good touch.  Service: the waiter kept making jokes and did not pick up that we didnt feel like joking around with him. They were nice.   Wine connoisseur: he was professional, knowledgeable, friendly and found the perfect white wine to go with the wagyu.  Overall: I paid good money for a dinner surrounded by bad jokes and the worst filet mignon I'd ever had. This is in stark contrast to Market by Jean Georges in Vancouver.",

    "text": "Sad to say this place was a total letdown. We had been very, very excited to come here because about 7 years back we remembered it as the best steak ever had but, seems like things have gone downhill. It wasn't bad - it was certainly a better steak than most (really, for the cost, it should be), but the service is truly terrible.   This restaurant is 1 of only 9 in the US that serves real Kobe beef - if you are not familiar with REAL Kobe beef, it is actually very fatty and rich. Suggestion is to order a regular wagyu and 3oz of the Kobe to try, unless you know what you're getting.   Steak quality and the 4 sauces offered is good.   We were seated relatively quickly with a reservation, and a waiter brought us the menus. After an intro to the menu, he disappeared. At this time we noticed one of our drink glasses had a very odd mark inside - it wasn't a bug or food, but literally looked like either melted wax or marker - wouldn't be a big deal if it was on the outside, but it was the inside. No joke it took about 10 minutes to catch ANYONE's attention to change it out... and then that person wasn't even our waiter, so we couldn't order. Finally we ordered - wagyu and fries for him, salad for me, and Kobe beef to come out right after the wagyu.   After ordering, bread came. We were pretty famished as it's been about 20min since being seated now. We asked for another. It didn't come.   Wagyu and salad came out relatively quickly after order. The tomato salad was exceptionally fresh. The fries never came. Nor did the second order of bread. Another 15 minutes goes by. We're wondering where the Kobe is too. Looking around, it's not like it's overly crowded. Plenty of tables empty an open. We're beyond frustrated right now - especially bc we have a show to catch. We gave ourselves 2 hours for dinner and as 2 people we can't understand how and why it's talking so long.   Waiter comes. We ask him to cancel the fries bc we don't want them anymore and they're not here, mention we still haven't received the second bread, and ask where the Kobe is. I swear it's like they just forgot to put the order in, because after 5 minutes, they bring it all - including the fries which they say is \"comped.\"  We're done within minutes. After about 10 minutes, waiter reappears with 2 desserts and advises that they're both free of charge because they \"appreciate our patience\" - molten cake and cheesecake. Neither of us wanted dessert, much less 2 - we would've preferred drinks comped, my salad comped - literally anything.   For a $500 meal (for 2 people - not including drinks), we were appalled by the lack of service and slow timing of everything. The restaurant was probably only at 50% capacity so it's not like there was good reason for it. The steak quality was NOT exceptional enough to outweigh the bad service (seriously, hillstone/Houston's probably better), and we definitely will not be returning or recommending.",

    "text": "We indulged in the 42oz Wagyu Tomahawk and it did not disappoint.  Very flavorful, well marbled, and good sauces to compliment.  This was accompanied by the truffle mac and the brussels sprouts.  Prior to that we had polished off a shellfish platter and a shrimp cocktail.  These were all excellent and cost $500 just for what's listed above.  If that sounds like a good deal since they were all very good, this is a good place for you.  We added a \"cheap\" bottle of wine, the always tasty Prisoner Zinfandel which could be gotten for $50 at most places but here it was $100.    All of those things despite the poor value could have still earned JG the 5 stars they want from me.  Unfortunately I think Vegas is going through a crunch for quality service staff.  I can see why, I mean it takes an army to keep this place going.  But Jean Georges had slow and inattentive service.  We were never asked about drinks after our wine ran out - I probably would have had more.  We sat with an empty table and nothing in our water glasses for like 10 minutes without anyone so much as looking at us.  I love my friends and I love chatting, but we were ready to go.  And like other reviews mentioned, the only thing the waiter could really tell us about was the $65 an ounce Kobe.   In my mind, the place is here for people who have money to burn and it's great high end fare.  Maybe we were ignored because we didn't get our tab into 4 figures. Probably if you are going to really spend money, you'll get plenty of attention.",

Priced at $139 this steak is worth it if you share it.  I can't imagine eating it by yourself.  It was the best porterhouse.  Perfectly cooked and seared.  The steak sauces complemented our steak.  We also added the half pound Alaskan King Crab.  This was awesome.  The way they prepared and served it really showed the class of this restaurant.   The wagyu beef carpaccio as an appetizer is the way to go.  Next time in Vegas it will be hard to choose between this place or Craftsteak.  Tough life it is....lol.",

My Filet Mignon suddenly seemed less tender and juicy after trying a slice of the Kobe Beef. The Trumpet Mushroom is so savory and the Grilled asparagus taste good as well.

    "text": "Huge bummer of a dinner at Jean Georges, which I was highly anticipating.  We had a reservation at 8.  We arrived right on time and were seated about 8:05, which is not a huge deal at a big time steakhouse on a Saturday night in Vegas.  When we sat we were immediately approached by one of our servers.  We were told that we would be having 2 servers for the evening, but the second server basically took our order and brought the check.  The other guy did all the work, but neither one of them were very attentive.  We had more than one occasion where at least one water glass was empty.  Further, a buddy of mine ordered a Captain and Coke and the empty glass sat on the table for quite some time.  Way too long for a place of Jean Georges' caliber.  The service was a major issue.  To eat, I went with the wedge salad, the bone-in ribeye, crab legs, and the table split black truffle mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes.  The gratis bread arrived hot and is served with sea salt on top and an herbed butter.  It was very good, I only had 2 pieces which was a minor miracle.  The somm was fantastic, really the only bright spot in the meal service-wise.  He was very knowledgeable and had a nice offering for me in my price range, which was on the MUCH lower end of JG's wine list.  This place is expensive for wine, even considering it is located in the Aria on the Las Vegas Strip.  So, unless you spend your summers in the South of France or own several homes, you'll probably be in for some sticker shock.  That said, the bottle that was recommended was excellent.  My wedge salad was good, it is a little more compact than other wedges I have had, but the blue cheese dressing and bacon were both good quality.  I would order this salad again.  The food was served hot but this is where the meal broke down.  My ribeye was overcooked well beyond medium rare.  I ate some of it (less than half) because getting the server's attention was difficult, and like I said earlier, they did not come to the table often.  So, rather than wait for another steak and have the rest of the food get cold, I placed it on another plate and ate my crab legs only.  The server noticed when they came to clear the table and I showed him the interior of the steak and he agreed it was overcooked.  He asked if I wanted another one and I said no, I did not want to wait.  They did remove this steak from the bill, so I will give JG that.  Overall, the steak was not seasoned properly and did not have a good char on the exterior.  So, this $70+ ribeye was a complete miss.  The sides were very underwhelming as well.  The black truffle mac and cheese was perhaps the worst mac and cheese I have had at a fancy steakhouse.  The breadcrumbs were not so much toasted as just put on top.  The truffle flavor was there, but the cheese was not.  Very weak sauce and another bummer.  The lobster mashed were better, but still nothing to write home about.  The crab legs were phenomenal, cooked properly and tasted great.  These and my salad were the bright spots in the meal.  As I said, very disappointing dinner that I was highly anticipating.  I may return to JG in the future since it does have a very good reputation.  It is possible I ate there on an off night, but with so much being subpar, that seems unlikely.",

Maybe it was sicker shock, the extremely loud environment. Either way the portions were small given the prices. The waiter was almost non existent but the bus person was very attentive. We tipped the usual 20 percent and side tipped the bus person but if given the option the waiter would have received 5 percent while the bus person would have received the rest.  I am guessing it was very busy and they were kind enough to let us know our meal would be delayed. I am guessing there was something going on behind the scenes. Maybe short staffed or something?  So given the experience I would give them another chance every place deserves a second chance just be prepared to pay more than other fine dining places.",

Let's start with the good: 1. Calamari was cooked perfectly 2. The sauces for the steaks were delicious. My fave were the habenero better and bearnaise  Intolerable (please noted I have high expectations, when I'm paying $130+ per person) 1. Service was horrible. Our busser/runner (Boris) was much attentive tha. Our server.  2. Our server removed my husband empty soda, without asking if he wanted another one. It took us 15 minutes, to track him down to find out what happened. When we did, his response was that he took it away becausw it was empty and they don't offer refills. (Let sit on that a minute. Why wouldn't you ask your guest if they'd like another one?! Did you assumed that they wouldn't be able to afford another $4.50 soda, even thought they are paying $130 per person. Or was it because they didn't order alcohol? We don't drink so why would we order alcohol?!  3. Our steaks were over cooked. My husband ordered medium rare and for medium. I ordered medium well and got well done and burnt. Normally I'm fine with that but the steak was tough and not what I expected from a premium steak house 4. We all had more they half our meal left and the servicer did ask if we'd like to pack it to go. (Every restaurant ask this but they guy just didn't care)  Overall, I will never come here again. Gordon Ramsey is well above the bar, that it makes this place looks like a cheap road side cafe. Gordon Ramsey is always booked but worth the wait. They are attentive and your drink is never empty. They bussed is so quite and quick, they anticipated the needs of their guest and take a care of it with you asking.",

Back in July 2013 and January 2013 I had full-on dinner with appetizers, mains, desserts and wines with a gal pal and guy friend, respectively.   So... I adore the food, decor and atmosphere! This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas right now.   Only one complaint about December (versus July & January) is that they didn't have foie gras during this last visit! I loved it so much during the previous visits that I was bummed. However, the bartender was so cool, he came back a few minutes later and told us that the place next door did have foie gras if we wanted some that evening at the place next door. Very professional.",

    "text": "I love great steak. I'm a big steakhouse fan. This is about the worst steakhouse I've ever been to. It's not because the food is so-so, but the service was worse than abysmal. This is a restaurant in serious need of training from the top down. The top here may or may not be Jean Georges, but there is some serious attitude training needed. The obvious aim was to be pretentious, which is never a good thing. But if you're going to be pretentious, then you'd better be able to back it up with stellar service. They didn't and couldn't. First the food.  The steak was so-so. My dining partner and I were going to split the small rib-eye, which was listed as an 18 oz. portion of prime beef. It came to the table a little small for its purported weight, which wasn't the problem. It was an OK rib-eye, but lacked flavor for a $45+ piece of steak. We also had a Caesar salad, which was good, but not great. Nice preparation with delicious anchovies on top. Couldn't fault that. We also ordered some Brussels sprouts, which were nice and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It came with walnuts and avocado, an unusual preparation, but delicious.   The wine list was inaccurate as well. A shiraz from Barossa (I'd been to the winery) was listed as being from New Zealand! About 3,000 miles away from South Australia and Barossa. It was kind of, but not very, cool that the wine list came on an iPad, but they would have been better served by using paper. I understand the concept, but not the execution.   No. While the food and wine was OK, even if way overpriced, the waitstaff and manager were the problem. And the problem was huge. First the waiter. There are ways a waiter can suss out what kind of knowledge the diner has about a product being presented. In this case, since I owned a restaurant once, I was very knowledgeable about beef. The waiter approached us as noobs who knew nothing. The meal came all divided up, but not well. The dishes were cleared away in such a manner that it appeared that they couldn't wait for us to leave. Plates and utensils were snapped up. As we finished our meal, the bus person came by and started clearing the table with a lot of clanking and jerked the place mat from under a drinking glass like a magician. It made a loud noise and seemed very rude. He ignored us when I told him to stop. Then I was angry.  The manager came by and asked if there was a problem, then proceeded to be a automaton, \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Yes sir.\" without hearing a word I said. Of course this was even more upsetting and condescending to us as diners who were paying a great deal of money for a mediocre meal. This man as a manager is in serious need of training or another profession.  At the end of the day, we left a very small tip. The waiter was OK. The manager was not. The only thing he did well was come to the table.  If you want a really good steak and good service that doesn't condescend, go across the street to Smith & Wollensky. Don't let your shadow fall on this place. I realize that this little diatribe won't make much difference because Jean Georges is located in the Aria hotel, so they get a huge captive audience, but I will be in Vegas again and I will go somewhere else. STAY AWAY from Jean Georges!",

I then ordered the Frise Salad with Lardon and warm poached egg, one of the best salads I have ever eaten. I then ordered the dry aged grass fed NY strip, amazing and it came with four different  sauces on the side; lobster mashed as my side, decent. Chocolate Lava cake for dessert. My daughter got the Mac and cheese which was delicious. My wife got the burger which was also amazing. The meat is so top notch that it has a different texture, it's smooth. Anyways a bit pricey, $400 for dinner but if your going there you know it. I suggest it.",

The bone in rib-eye was cooked perfectly and very high quality beef, could stack up with any other steakhouse in Vegas.  Slightly disappointed in the truffled mac cheese, very weak truffle flavor.  Finished with the gold bar, which just for the presentation is worth it.  As others have mentioned its not cheap, but not different than the other high end steak houses.

The service was spot on!  I feel the prices were pretty fair for the type of restaurant and locations. But it was still expensive. One person in our party had the $50 per ounce Kobe steak! It was good, but not worth $330.  I enjoyed it as much as STK and much more than Prime at Bellagio  If I were to be critical, I would say the wine by the glass list is way to small! I know they want to up sell bottles. The other thing, is the menu really lacked creativity... just stupid simple salads, and the menu only had very cliche items on the menu. I would expect more from Jean George. He is such a culinary genius, needs to review the menu that bears his name",

Ordered  oysters to start  not impressed by size  taste amazing .    Every-time I looked over to see if Gary was available to assist us  he would fine another couple to attend.  And when he finally made contact he then stated  \" im going to need more time\" in a frustrated voice.   But always found time to converse with another couple who stated they worked at another hotel.  Made various visits and verbal contact with other couples but managed to consistently avoid us. When  the food arrived the server who brought the food explained the sauces to compliment our filet mignon.   Well cooked and tasted great kitchen is doing superb guys keep it up.    After having a empty blue label cup for about seven minutes  I was able to get Gary  to serve me another.  Now is Gary a bad guy I dont think so ,did he make bad moral judgment yes. I think there is room for improvement and treating everyone fairly. My bill was 330 and I rounded it to a total of 400.  I wont treat you the way you treated us. Improve yourself Gary Because in our visit you represent Jean Georges Steak House.  I will finish by saying people will always forget what you did for them but they will never forget how you made them feel!!!",

    "text": "When it comes to Vegas steakhouses, they're all pretty much the same -- hi-quality cuts of meat and obscenely overpriced sides, everything a la carte to drain your retirement funds as quickly as possible. Ambiance is the only variation, so I'll address that first.  This place is dark and cavernous, with an aesthetic somewhere between modern douche and old-school clubby swank. There was nothing really standout about the atmosphere that would make me recommend this place over any other steakhouse in Vegas -- not nostalgic enough to be kitschy or fun; not edgy enough to be hipster. Service was good and all staff was attractive, well-groomed and marriageable. Nothing spoils a pricey meal like ugly staff!  The meal itself was good enough for being so hubristically priced; I understand paying a premium for top-quality cuts of meat, but for reals, guys....how can you with a straight face charge $14 for a POTATO? All you did was rub salt on it and throw it in the oven. Get over it!  Aside from my hi-class potato and petite filet, which was fine and came with some kind of spicy chimichurri-type sauce, I also had the truffle mac and cheese (SUPER rich, almost too rich to enjoy) and the spring greens salad, which was so totally blanketed in cheese that I barely tasted the subtle deliciousness of the crunchy greens. Why go thru all the trouble of sourcing organic/sustainable/whatever greens when you're just doing to dump so much cheese on it that it masks the flavor? Weird. Everything was so over-the-top rich that I ended up stuffed after only a couple bites of my steak...so my dog is enjoying the rest. (He said 5 stars, but he doesn't get out much.)  Overall, it was just fine. Moderately less pretentious than other swanky steakhouses in town....but certainly nothing exciting. I would come here again, but only if someone else was paying.",

My rib eye was cooked to perfection with an amazing charred crust and the seasoning was spot-on.   About the side dishes. The sauteed corn, trumpet mushrooms, truffle mac and cheese were all delicious and beautifully seasoned - every bite was a \"wow\" moment. The bone marrow itself is seasoned well and is a generous portion (a giant tomahawk bone longer than my arm) but the bread offering was too thick for my taste as it took over every bite of the marrow. We also could have done without the lobster mashed potatoes (which was really just creamy potatoes with 3 small lumps of lobster).   The staff were patient and accommodating and we never felt rushed or delayed. One negative is the $50 corkage fee, but that's negligible compared to the cost of a wine purchased through the restaurant. This will be on my go-to restaurant for my next trips to Vegas! Highly recommend.",

Bartender was a great server and very informative with drink recommendations (got a local beer on tap, which was very good). Was there for the $69 early evening dinner, available 5-7pm daily: appetizer (went with the caesar salad), main (got the 8oz filet mignon), dessert (warm chocolate cake with ice cream). The caesar was average at best. The filet mignon was very good especially with the array of sauces provided (complementary). The chocolate cake was nothing special.   OK value even for the $69 price. As expected, service was impeccable. The restaurant space itself was beautiful - dark but modern and clean. Not sure if I would have come here IF i didn't have the casino credit",

Ordered the scallops, which were seasoned well and paired with a snap pea and a puree that I couldn't fully identify but enjoyed. Next time I would order a salad or side with it, as the portion is small with 4 scallops and what you would expect for a 'side' from a high end restaurant. My neighbor recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp, and the shrimp cocktail was recommended if you are hungry and ready for an option close to immediately after being seated. Plan to go back to try their steak when I'm not dieting.",

His attentiveness and personable demeanor make the visit here just that much better! This time we tried the wagyu Brisket and the Tomahawk and per usual; it was second to none.

    "text": "Let me start out with what we (my wife and I) did enjoy. The bread was amazing, warm and moist. We ordered the calamari to start with and that was just out of this world melt in your mouth. Definitely one of the better, if not the best, we have had so far. Lastly, the bone marrow exceeded expectations as well, the fact that it was a menu item already had scored points. But it was prepared quite nicely and paired nicely with the sauce that it came with spread on the small slices of toasted bread they provided. But from a food standpoint, this is where the good times ended for us.  Our entrees were a major disappointment from the high expectations that JGS was supposed to command. My wife had the sea bass and I had the Waygu tomahawk ribeye that wasn't on the menu as it was a special. Both of our entrees were on the very salty side which seems to have been pronounced by the way the meat was grilled. Having a great cut of beef or sea bass ruined by saltiness is such a disappointment and an unpleasant taste that's hard to get rid of.  Luckily the steaks come with some creative sauces that when applied enough can help counter the saltiness. But I also like to just enjoy a juicy and tender steak with just the natural taste of the fat on the meat. This wasn't the case here. Had to eat every bite with the sauce. While I finished my steak (I wasn't going to let a great cut of beef go to waste esp. for the price), my wife could only get through a little over half of her sea bass.  The lobster truffle Mac and the creamy spinach were quite ordinary. My wife felt the Mac and cheese was a bit salty, while I felt it just lacked any inspiring or memorable taste. But the entrees were still the bigger disappointment.  On the upside, service was great. We were always attended to and recommendations were proactively given. When I didn't like the taste of one of the cocktails, it was quickly replaced with another.  The photographer was pleasant as well. She even made conversation with us and asked if we were celebrating anything. I only bring this up b/c my wife made dinner reservations for JGS over the phone about 3 weeks before we ate here. We had dinner here on the evening of 5/10 as my wife wanted to take me to a place to enjoy an amazing stake to celebrate my 40th birthday. She made sure to mention this when she made the reservation as this was how she wanted to kick off our stay on Vegas to celebrate my birthday weekend. Disappointedly, the restaurant didn't make a note and she was anxiously waiting throughout the dinner for it to be acknowledged, but unfortunately it wasn't. So this just added to her overall disappointing experience.  Net..net ... for us JGS will be a memorable experience for the wrong reasons, and we will share our experience honestly to those that ask, but I'm a firm believer that everyone should always try something once and make their own judgements from their own experience. But for us, will be hard to convince ourselves to come back here again.",

To start off on a positive note , The service was very good and the manager overseeing was attentive on our special requests. The problem with the steaks.If you're going here for the steaks I would pass. We got the Tomahawk and work coached into doing so, it's a Japanese  beef 48 ounce cut with bone in. It arrived in a beautiful state but once it was sliced up a table side it became a fatty mess. We talked about sending it back in finally did in the restaurant was attentive and bring us two additional sticks complementary and a fillet and New York. The problem was those steaks were also overcooked dry and grainy. I appreciated the restaurant trying to work with us but when it came down to it the steaks were just not very good and not cooked very well. They also complimented us with a scotch At the end which was a nice touch and we appreciate it but the PF Changs and feel of the restaurant and the steak quality will not allow me to go back. Service was excellent and the bright point of the meal.",

It is a good size but when my aunt couldn't finish hers and offered It to me I didn't turn it down. ( I usually decline offers like that but it would have been a sin to say , \"no\". ) The waiters came by and dropped off the sauces. They both said the Miso was their favorite I tried it but I'm sticking with the Bernaise for my personal choice.   I also had a side of lobster mashed potatoes. I've got to say they are not the best that I've had. They were runny and just too salty. It was the color of a drab pumpkin. There were only a couple of pieces on the top and that was it. I was expecting chunks of lobster mixed into regular mashed potatoes or even better some garlic mash. It was hard to eat it all.   We finished dinner with the cheesecake and glazed cherries. I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I saved that for my husband and ate the glazed cherries. They were stuffed in the thin sugar cookie tube with whipped cream. It may have been small but it was delicious!",

    "text": "Innovative cow and one mighty fine top tier steakhouse.  Recent renovation and menu make over complete, the new Jean Georges Steakhouse relinquishes the highbrow steakhouse feel for shiny contemporary elegance catering to the contemporary foodie.   Oh heck, it looks cool and the food, excellent.  Note:  composite review based on two visits.  Wasting no time,   the tomato salad, well selected heirloom varietal, meaty, juicy and bursting with tomato flavor topped by a generous heaping of heart of palm dressed in a coconut oil vinaigrette that makes flavors explode.  Perfect for summer.  More veg?  A warm asparagus with chanterelles and crushed hazelnuts  that has you wondering how so few ingredients go so well with one another.  Vibrant vegetal flavor of the asparagus made even more pronounced by the nutty earthiness.    Meat starters; this still is a steakhouse after all, begin with the Japanese Wagyu carpaccio atop a truffle aioli and balsamic syrup, a sprinkle of lime salt to finish, incredible.  The fat of the beef immediately begins to melt in your mouth its flavor brought out by the perceived saltiness as the aroma of the truffle creates umami that doesn't exist in the beef.  Translated, one delicious bite.  IG worthy, the bone marrow.  A 20\" bone sawed in half, roasted and served with a vibrant, citrusy gremolata, that cuts the richness, excellent.  Spread on some simple toast.  Solid.  The main event, a low and slow smoked Mishima Ranch, American Wagyu brisket is outstanding.  Passes the spank test, wiggling and giggling, accordion effect when you pull it apart (some resistance), beautiful black bark, smoke ring evident, dripping with peppery juices.  Pit masters in Austin or Lockhart would be proud of this.  More beef?  A ribcap (Mishima Ranch wagyu), aggressively seasoned, perfectly cooked.  Very rich.  Very well prepared bone in veal chop.  Obviously humanely raised, allowed to graze, beefy taste with all the tenderness you expect from veal.  Excellent.  Solid but traditional sides.  The truffle mac and cheese makes the perfect partner to the smoked brisket, just saying.  Excellent wine program with a good balance between new and old world producers all curated by a sommelier who puts pairings above label upselling.  Typical Vegas resort markup but many good choices can be had for $150 - $250.  Outstanding service and near perfect kitchen timing.    Without a doubt, one of the top five steakhouses in Vegas",

    "text": "Meh - I've experienced better sums up our experience.  Like most patrons, I did extensive research to select a steakhouse to celebrate our tenth anniversary.  We were staying at Sky Suites so Jean Georges was an easy selection.  The ambience is dark and adds to the experience.  We were promptly seated for our 6:30pm reservation fulfilled by the Aria concierge.  The concierge did note our anniversary celebration on our reservation, but there was no mention of it by the restaurant team.  The menu was straight forward and we selected a shrimp cocktail to start, followed by filet's for the main course coupled with asparagus and baked potato for sides.  We added the scallop accompaniment (3 for $36) topped off with two rounds of dirty martini's (delicious).  $400 out the door.  We left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The service was on par with Outback as was the food.  Seriously, our filets were bland, lacked any resemblance of flavor and were \"plopped\" on our plates.  The sauces were interesting, but I elected for garlic butter which the staff whipped up for me.  We were served bread and butter 30 seconds after our entrees were delivered while the surrounding tables were provided their bread and butter upon arriving for dinner.  Not once did the servers every ask how our food was.  It's implied that the food is wonderful and if it's not prepared correctly or not to your liking, it doesn't really matter.  I really want to like this restaurant, but if the A1 or A5 beef is anything like our filet, I'm thrilled we didn't drop $400 on a 6oz A5 filet.  In closing, avoid this establishment if you would like to experience a memorable steak.  There are far too many strip steak houses that are much less expensive with far better steaks with servers who care about you and your dining experience.",

I mowed almost three servings of bread with the \"organic\" butter (whatever that means) and Liz kept coming in hot with fresh servings.  Note in photo - could only hit the inside after the second loaf due too limited remaining stomach capacity.  Drinks were great.  Food was superior.  The ribs were so good I was considering Fedexing some home.  The Rib Eye was very flavorful but I am skeptical about the number of OZ's served vs. advertised.  I cannot dwell on that fact though due to the flavor.  The seafood speaks for itself in the photos along with some very custom desserts that I ate but they actually put me over the edge due to the excessive bread consumption.  It would be nice if high end places like this could limit the bread for people with low self control to ensure they can enjoy the rest of the food.  Peace.",

Starting with ambiance, the place is beautiful, has a good energy, and the tables are spaced out well (unlike others where u feel like you are rubbing knees with the next table). The service was wonderful from everyone we interacted with. All very friendly and helpful. It was a good noise level where you can hear your table perfectly without screaming but the restaurant was not overly quiet to where you wonder who can hear your convo.   Now the food - there was 5 of us and so we ordered a bunch of appetizers, sides, plus entrees. Not a single complaint from my foodie snob friends (Rare occurrence) Highlights were the Wagyu carpaccio, seared scallops, scallops sashimi, tuna tartare, smashed potatoes, ribeye, short ribs, truffle mashed potatoes, truffle polenta, salmon. Our dessert platter was awesome as well.   I will definitely be back - this place is great for groups, business dinners , date night, special occasions, and \"me time\".",

The food was wonderful I had the salmon and I definitely recommend it, but the class of the staff really sells the joint. If you're stopping in don't settle for anyone but Darren!",

Jason at the bar was well informed, attentive, and entertaining.   Let's talk about the Kobe. I know people will claim it melts in your mouth and it is the things that dreams and memories are made of. Blah blah. Yada yada yada. But here's the truth: it is!!! I'm serious. It's impossible to explain but here goes. As soon as you cut into it, your knife starts to glide, similar to a hydroplaning car: you can attempt to guide it, but it's not in your control. Then the Kobe touches your tongue. It melts like cotton candy. It bursts in your mouth like pop-rocks. Yes, the meat literally melts in your mouth. I know that cliche is overused to the point of...well becoming a cliche so I'll clarify; you don't have to chew this Kobe. I experimented: 3 chews is all it takes to digest, at the most.  So this is the point where you stop reading reviews and just get a reservation and enjoy. Thank me later.",

After drink orders were taken, the feast began with Executive Chef Sean Griffin serving the table what he had planned having been given carte blanche to plan the meal for our group.  Starting with the appetizers, the foie gras torchon and seared foie gras were superb as always.  The salads followed with my favorites being the endive and tomato salads.  Then came the meat.  There were two platters of meat with prime filet mignon, wagyu tomahawk, lamb chops, and prime porterhouse on one and some of the same on the other along with 2 Jean Georges burgers.  There was also a very large brisket that was extremely tender.  I wish Yelp allowed uploading videos not done with the Yelp app.  Accompanying them were sauteed mushrooms, mashed potatoes, truffle fries, crunchy potatoes,  et. al.  After most of the main course, we were brought two dessert platters and a salted caramel sundae.  The photos speak for themselves!!  What sets Jean Georges apart is the attention to detail. Detail in designing the menu, detail in having the finest meats, detail in service, and detail in customer service!  It was a great evening with good friends in a grand setting with some excellent food!",

    "text": "Although online review sites and public relations departments across the city would have one believe otherwise, Jean Georges Steakhouse has been one of Las Vegas best ever since Chef Sean Griffin took over in 2015, and on Thursday evening he, Robert Phillips and team once again proved precisely why.  Now celebrating nearly a decade on Aria's second floor, only it and The Buffet remaining since December 2009 while so much else has changed, it is immediately after eyes adjust to recessed lighting that guests find themselves amidst a well appointed room, background music never invasive but just loud enough to drown-out surrounding tables.  More swanky since a Summer 2017 rebrand, gold replacing red and several new service pieces helping bring Chefs tableside, it was as a party of seven including five first-timers that carte blanche was given to Chef Griffin, Wine and Cocktails quickly followed by buttery Loaves of Brioche and individual Amuse portions of Wagyu Beef draped over Choux with molten Cheese and truffled Mayonnaise.  Reined in slightly from past visits, a different crowd necessitating accessible flavors but at the same time agreeable to being more adventurous than usual, it was with share-plates set that course one featured two seasonally-dressed menu items plus Jean Georges' offering for #picnicinthepark, the Thai-inspired Wraps enjoyable with or without added heat but nonetheless unable to match snappy Shrimp wrapped in Bacon or creamy Duck Liver blended with Nuts and spread on Toast with Jam.  Using Salad as a segue to grilled Meats, the iconic Hearts of Palm and Tomatoes praised by all for its brightness while sliced Asparagus made new fans thanks to Nuts plus Mushrooms, it was with plates re-set that table quickly filled, a large central board of three Steaks from Greeley Colorado predictably gathering the most attention, in particular for the full-size Bone that one guest ascertained must be a prop from \"The Flintstones.\"  Deferring temperature to the kitchen, diners typically used to Medium-Well or beyond pleasantly surprised by just how good a shade of pink can be when treated correctly, it was from sides including Mashed Potatoes and vibrant Snap Peas that many took large helpings, though those more knowledgeable went straight for sizable Belgian Asparagus with Ramps two-ways plus Parisian Gnocchi interspersed with roasted Morels and Fava Beans.    Drawing eyes from around the room with Smoked Wagyu sliced tableside, a neighboring table even requesting a small slice of the residual end before ordering one of their own, it was with Beef soon gone that many reluctantly considered Chicken, though all who did immediately agreed that the combination of brining, grilling and light Tempura was an unanticipated highlight.  Now 9pm, two \"stuffed\" guests calling it a night before Dessert, those who remained were treated to the full array of Jean Georges Steakhouse sweets, both Cheesecake and the Molten Cake purportedly \"invented\" by Vongerichten gone fast while seasonal Citrus in the form of Creme Brulee and Pound Cake each also performed well - though by the end all agreed that they wished they had saved room for more of Sin City's best Apple Pie or the Salted Caramel Sundae.  FIVE STARS:  Fit for \"foodies\" and traveling epicures, but equally accessible to those raised on Corn-fed commodity Beef in the Midwest, Jean George Steakhouse continues to shine as a result of Ingredient sourcing and passionate personnel with no signs of slowing in terms of quality or creativity.",

The crab leg was also pretty good but pricey! We also ordered the truffle mashed and creamed spinach. Both very rich but very good. Overall great experience, at the end they surprised us with extra birthday desserts. Can't say no to chocolate",

Dare I say, it maybe a tad better than Craftsteak!   Like the hotel, it's a modern look and feel their main dining room. Our server was great. Very knowledgeable, refilled our champagne, and was a professional.   My two favorite things to order foie gras and meat! Their $132 porterhouse was out of this world good. Cooked a oerfect medium rare and the flavor was just great. Liked the sauces that came with it. Alaskan crab legs was meaty and sweet. Easily feeds two or even three people.

The texture of the steak was like it was cooked on a low flame, tough and rubbery. Dinner before tip was $500 with no bottled wine. The price was fine but the meat was not Prime -- not Prime at all. Next door at Bellagio at \"Prime \" the steaks are perfect and the same at SW at the Wynn or the Mirage or the Old Homestead at Caesars and even the Steak House at the Four Queens downtown. With that said there are plenty to choose from and all about the same price so why waist your money at Jean George.  Last food delivery to table starting with two shared appetizers was like throwing it on the table and walked away.   That's it.",

Our 16 oz bone in dry eyed new york strip was not medium rare like we would have liked and was a tad bland (except for the parts that were charred).  We also ordered a 6 oz Tajima wagyu steak which came out perfectly rare. Expensive, yes, but the meat was super tender.  We also ordered a truffle mashed potatoes and that was rich and creamy with truffle on top. You can't go wrong with truffle! We also loved the cute small pot that the mashed potatoes were served in.   The meal came with multiple dipping sauces, including soy miso, barbecue, and a bernaisse sauce but I found the salsa verde sauce to be the best.  My favorite part of the meal was the bread served with butter. The bread tasted exactly like a croissant-buttery and delicious inside. The butter served with it was mixed with tarragon powder.  I probably wouldn't come back here again. It was mediocre steak that wasn't worth what we paid for.",

    "text": "For the food, I'd give it 4 stars. It's great, you definitely won't be disappointed by the quality.   Atmosphere is excellent, very modern, flashy, serious, romantic, it's a classy place.  For the service (for the hefty price tag you pay here), I'd give it 3 or 2.5 stars. They could be a bit more personable and welcoming. We're here in Vegas, dressed up fancy, at 4-5star hotel, to eat steak at 'Jean-Georges'...you've goT to step up the service. Diners coming to eat this restaurant aren't just looking for great cow meat. We want to be pampered, and I shouldn't have to reach out for my waiter throughout the night. Do smile to customers.    My last tip for diners; if the waiter asks you if you want to try 'the special', make sure to check the price. My friend went with it without asking and ended up with a surprising $300+ bill for a plate of steak samplers.   Overall, if they pump up the service, the restaurant would be a True 4+ star restaurant.",

The last knowledgeable sommelier was from The Jules Verne at the Eiffel tower!  The service was alright. Waiter seemed overly eager to take our order which is annoying. Besides that it was fine.  However I must say the hostess was retarded. We made reservations but when we arrived the place was dead save one other table. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when host staff seats us in a quiet restaurant next to the only other table in the restaurant thats occupied. I understand keeping people in the server's sections but the place was EMPTY. I requested to be moved and the hostess acted put off and bitchy. Very rude and snotty about it. I graciously blamed it on my father's tendency to tell loud stories after he's had a few glasses of wine--but really there is no excuse for this. If we are going to pay $500 for a meal we want a good experience and that includes being seated in a way that allows us the privacy to enjoy ourselves and our conversation.   Other than that the food was delicious!",

My steak was cooked ok but my husband's was overcooked( he had asked for medium rare.).  Another thing that we find strange was that we were served with 4 different sauces to go with our steaks.  For us, this was the first because we had never been served any type of sauces in any high-end steakhouse.  High quality steaks shouldn't require any condiments other than salt and pepper!  Our overall dining experience was extremely disappointing.  We expect better everything especially when we paid $300+ for a couple of steaks and an appetizer!",

The black truffle mac and cheese was disgusting and my date and I sent that back, along with the bland Cesar salad.  The waiter was clueless in regards to the age of the Glenlivet ordered.

Ordered:  bone marrow - this was delicious...served on toast and some secret slaw salsa concoction...we finished two of these. seared foie gras - this was good but a bit on the bitter side...thinking the reduction sauce was completed on time so it left a bit to be desired but the foie was perfect and the figs balanced it well. calimari - was one of the best i've had...soft and the batter was seasoned to perfection...you almost didn't need a dip.  that good. black truffle mash - only had a couple spoon fulls of this as I could feel the butter clogging my arteries just smelling it.  it was very good though and nice compliment to the steaks. porterhouse - aged and cooked with TLC.  couldn't ask for more here.  NOW for the main event!  The server suggested this Wagyu / Angus cross bred cow called the Australian tomahawk chop (think bone-in rib eye with the dark fatty outer cap trimmed)...another yelper said theirs wasn't that good, however, ours was insanely flavorful and was awesome.  Great steakhouse...but call early because they fill up quickly.",

    "text": "I love food. All kinds of food, from the hole in the wall burger joint, taqueria, or dumpling house to the high end Patina group restaurants. I eat out a great deal (I'm well into my quest to eat at every restaurant in Pasadena) but I actually don't write many reviews.  After my experience at Jean George Steakhouse this past weekend I knew I had to write something, so congratulations to them for getting my first negative review.  The service was on the low end of acceptable, but that is something I can live with if the food is good. Sadly, it wasn't. Except for the tomato soup: that was fantastic.  The bacon wrapped shrimp was too salty and greasy. The mashed potatoes were salty and very runny. The medium rare fillet showed up with a heavy char. These are very standard and simple to prepare dishes that I've had many other places and this is one of the reasons that I ordered them: they are a litmus test. If you use quality ingredients and prepare the dishes with care there's no excuse to not do them well. I mean seriously, who messes up mashed potatoes? Especially ones that cost $12.00.  I asked the waiter to bring the manager over and I described and showed him the food. I prefaced my discussion by saying that I wasn't doing this to get a discount, I wanted to let him know of some things that were going on in the kitchen and that I expected much better.  I didn't insist on new food as that really isn't my way. He thanked me and went off. He didn't return and the bill was for the entire meal. This is clearly one of the options open to him. As was offering to make me a new steak or taking the runny salty potatoes off the bill. Instead he chose the option that really prompted this review.  As I left the manager asked me to come again. Now why would I want to do that? This also showed a distinct lack of awareness or seriousness. I am telling my Vegas friends and traveling companions that we can do much better than Jean Georges Steakhouse.",

    "text": "Jean George's Steakhouse is a favorite of a good buddy of mine, so when he hits up Vegas, we often drop in for dinner and and drinks. I have been a few times and really like the style of the room and quality of the steaks.   We started our most recent trip at the bar with a couple of martinis. Very well made and very friendly service from the bartender. We had mentioned that we were having dinner inside and he offered to have our bill transferred, but we paid the man, as we didn't want him to lose out on the tip. We only waited about 5 minutes and our table was ready.   It seems every time we dine at Jean George's, the tasting menu is where we go for our food selections. It's a great price around $80 for 4 courses, and has a jalapeno-relish foie gras course that I really dig. We often add to this menu with an additional side item or appetizer, but I find it to be a lot of what I like about the restaurant. The food is great, and t he steaks for the main course are always prepared just the way we ask with exceptional flavor.   I have to say that over the past few times I have ben there - service has not been consistent. The service staff that handles the food always seems a bit 'ho-hum' with their service style. It's not about the casual nature or a friendly demeanor, both things which I appreciate about a server.. but just a kind of a lack of interest maybe? Could be they are amongst the busiest places at the ARIA Hotel, so maybe there is just no time for personal service? It never leaves me impressed, but that's just me.   I will say that the Sommelier's and bar staff are always extremely friendly and attentive with service.  Every bottle of wine is attended to properly and  never has my glass been empty or even less than plenty :) To add to that, the dining room is situated that I don't feel i have ever had a undesirable table. The most recent trip had us sitting up against the glass room that held the wall of wine for the restaurant. really nice space.  I would most-definitly go back to Jean Georges again, as it is very good food, and I do like the atmosphere. I say start in the bar with a good stiff drink and have a great bottle of wine with your steaks! Happiest Eating!",

But last, we sat at a table for four hours, that you should have been able to turn at least one more time, talk about poor business planning.

The room alone set a very classy and elegant mood. It was dimly lit for a more intimate scene, and everything was clean and looked so modern.   Now onto the food. I ordered the 8oz. Filet MIgnon and couldn't even finish it! Granted, we did order a buttload of sides, but the steak was cooked just to perfection and served with a tantalizing green sauce (I wish I remembered what was in it!). For sides, we ordered a bunch so all 11 of us could share. We got french fries (came with lots of dipping sauces), truffle mashed potatoes, steamed asparagus, and a shitake and artichoke side. The truffle mashed potatoes was hands down my favorite side dish, they were absolutely to die for!!  Like many upscale restaurants in Vegas, it's definitely a pricey restaurant, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny!!",

We started with a shrimp cocktail appetizer- the shrimp tasted old and fishy and the cocktail sauces were over salted.  We also ordered a salad, the $62 ribeye and asparagus. The salad was mediocre and the asparagus was under cooked.  The steak was horrible.  The cut of meat was poor, it was over cooked and was over seasoned.   Lastly, why would a restaurant of this category feel the need to charge for a refill on a Soda?  One of the things we love about Vegas is the dining experiences and love the different restaurants.

I love Vegas and stay at the Aria pretty much everytime we go, and I wouldn't not recommend this place, but I wouldn't highly recommend it either.   It was okay. That's all.",

I had party of seven and it was pretty make a reservation, but it was most likely because it was on a Monday night. Our server was very nice, and the place looked very nice in my opinion.  I ordered the rib eye steak and my girlfriend ordered the filet minon. Our steak was just okay, it wasn't anything special. My steak was very bland and it came with four different sauces on the side which I did not really care for. My side order was the bone marrow but that was also very bland...   I wouldn't go back to this place especially if I am looking to have good steak, I would say going to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse is probably a better choice.",

My husband ordered the lamb. It was delicious.  The waiter didn't explain any of the sauces that were brought out with the lamb.

    "text": "******************* UPDATE REVIEW *******************             Located in the promenade of the Aria Hotel. I've followed chef Robert Moore since his day at Prime, Bellagio. My parents also celebrated their anniversary at Prime when Chef Moore was there. This anniversary, my parents wanted to come here after seeing countless of my yummy pictures.            My broski family also joined us. We got lucky with a gorgeous booth in the back, separated from the rest of the adult crowd, so my nieces & I could be loud! (OK, so just me that was loud!)            Another sommelier Jeff was there to help me with my wine pairing, after a quick talk, he was at many restos that I'd been too, how cool is that? Our server Timothy was also wonderful & the rest of the servers were so patiently with my lil nieces.  WINES: I'm the only one that drank!  - Domaine de la Cadette Bourgogne Vezelay la Chatelaine - A Chardonnay Dry White Table wine from Chablis, Burgundy, France - a younger wine, but fantastic.  - 2005 Maculan Torcolato - Italy, Veneto, Breganze - a perfect pairing for the Foie Gras Terrine!  - 2006 Shafer One Point Five Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, this is one good bottle!  - Oremus Tokaji Aszu, 5 Puttonyos was my dessert!  AMUSE BOUCHE: - Lobster bisque with brandy cream, tarragon & herbs, crouton - heard that the chef cooked that bisque for a few hours. This was so creamy, tasty & even my 7 years old niece loved it!  SALAD: - Baby iceberg lettuce bacon - my dad always goes for salad because he's a super healthy man, so those crispy bacons, were for my nieces & i ;-)  SIMPLY RAW: - Kussi & Nantucket Oysters with cocktail sauce & Mignonette sauce - I had it here last month, and I had it again!  Just perfect pairing with the Domaine de la Cadette Bourgogne Vezelay la Chatelaine white Burgundy!  - Tuna tartare avocado soy-ginger dressing, cracker - this was just perfect.  APPETIZERS: - Tempura calamari peashoots & chili dip - my parents & my broski family, all loved this one!   - Peekytoe crab cake - mom's dish, & she didn't let me try it & it was gone!  - Crusted tuna citrus sriracha emulsion - love the sauce!  - Grilled Foie Gras Terrine Apple-Jalepano Marmalade, Grilled Country Bread - I had this dish every single time I'm here!!! Perfectly pairing with the Sauternes, or 2005 Maculan Torcolato - Italy, Veneto, Breganze!  - Bacon wrapped shrimp papaya mustard cilantro - what a lovely combination, you can't go wrong with this! My nieces 11 & 7 enjoyed this a lot or anything with bacon in it ;-)  ENTREES: - Soy-glazed short rib apple-jalapeno puree rosemary crumbs - since my sister in law loved everything that cooked well, nothing better than this 8 hours cooked short rib!  - Australian lobster tail - special on the menu, my dad went for it.  - Kobe cheeseburger miso russian dressing yuzu pickles - my broksi dish - got to see see the cheese melted on the beef, so juicy. I got a bite of it oh my Kobe!  - Filet Mignon - Mom went for it & it was perfectly cooked to her liking.  4 choices of steak sauces for you to choose!  - 300 days corn fed Australian steak - off the menu, you have to ask the chef for this special cut! Oh my Buddha, was that steak something!  I must have STEAKgasm! This is why MY FAVORITE PET IS STEAK!  SIDE DISHES: - Caramelized brussel sprout - special menu, this was so good & perfect for Thanksgiving weekend dish!  - Roasted Royal Trumpet Mushrooms garlic & olive oil - delish as always, a MUST HAVE DISH here!  - French Fries for my nieces.  - Black truffles & comte fritter with French Brie cheese - these little balls got much texture, aromatic, crispy on the outside, cheezzzee inside, taste so heavenly to me. This dish is second the the Royal Trumpet Mushrooms dish!  DESSERTS: - New York Cheesecake cherry compote sour cherry - the cheesecake was so delicious & I don't eat sweet! - Salted caramel ice cream sundae - my broski & sister in law licked the plate good. - Grand manier souffle mandarin sorbet - My dad enjoyed it a lot!              My nieces got the honor to meet chef Robert Moore & other chefs in the kitchen, they got to see the rarely to be seen kitchen. What a nice surprise for them!              Another night with impeccable service, on the night of my parents anniversary & my lil niece 7th BDAY celebration!  Another great night with great wines, food, & family in Las Vegas.  Life is as good as it gets!  Overall: 5 stars For value: 5 stars For Food: 5 stars For Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 5 stars",

I had the Lamb and it was just a little on the overcooked side.  For the price they could give you a larger portion.  Several folks here have commented on the music...I think they need to have a different selection.  I am not sure what 17 yr old emo kid programmed their songs, but change it up.  Oh, and if you are going to say you have a dress code, then please enforce it.  We made reservations for 6 of us and were informed that there was a dress code of no shorts or T-shirts, but after we were seated a large group of guys came in dressed in, you guessed it, Shorts, T-Shirts and flip flops!    The service was tremendous and our server was engaging and friendly.",

We arrived somewhat early and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. There were 2 bartenders working and for a solid 7 minutes no one even said \"hello\" to us. Needless to say we did not get a drink before sitting at our table. We ordered an appetizer, salad and shared a main entree. It took 45 minutes for our medium rare steak to arrive at our table from when our salads were cleared and it was still under cooked. The steak lacked flavor, which might be the reason they serve all their steaks with sauces. The oysters we ordered were extremely fishy which was gross. All in all this was a huge disappointment. Over priced for low quality food. Do not recommend.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here last Friday night. We were staying at the Aria for our wedding on Saturday night and wanted to make sure that the entire weekend was top-notch. Jean George Steakhouse came recommended as one of the best dining experiences at our hotel.  Our concierge made reservations for us at nine and we were seated after a very short wait. It looks small from the entrance, but don't be deceived, this restaurant is huge! The decor was generally very posh, but as you enter the restaurant, you walk past a circular bar.   The bar is gorgeous ( a cool black lace type of pattern), but the effect is ruined by the TV's behind the bar. Although upscale, there is no sort of dress code and there were many people at the bar in jeans and scruffy tee-shirts. Although I generally dress this way, it was a bit of a let-down to see it at such a nice restaurant, especially on a Friday night.  The waitstaff was generally very friendly and personable. We joked around with them and it gave the place a but of a casual air. It was comfortable. They were also very professional and attentive, with our course coming out at a good pace and our drinks always full. It felt like we had a team of servers, as we interacted with many different people.   We went with the five course tasting menu with wine pairing. Each course was beautifully and artistically arranged. I wanted to take pictures, but it just didn't seem appropriate! It was often too pretty to eat!   The first course was Caviar served in a lemon and on a bed of a lemon jelly. It was delicious. The second course was tomato based. I can't remember exactly what was on it, but it was very good. The third was scallops- my favorite course! I can't recall the fourth course, but the final was an amazing cut of steak. We added the truffle mashed potatoes, which are a must-do! For dessert, we had a chocolate mouse. Everything was outstanding.  A piece of advice- If you do the wine pairing (and you should) skip having a pre-dinner drink. I actually got fairly drunk and couldn't finish or properly enjoy my meal. It's a big undertaking, go in on an empty stomach!  Also, be prepared to spend more on pictures. They had a photographer going around to the tables and our pictures were so good, that we bought all of them. We spent about 150.00 on the pictures alone. They were great though!  Jean George Steakhouse is a decadent meal. The food is upscale, but the vibe is relaxed. I'm glad that we went here, but it isn't a good pick for a \"romantic\" restaurant, which is what I was hoping for on my wedding weekend. It's loud and busting. Fun and vibrant. But alas, not romantic!",

We chose a steak special not on the menu....cured Kobe steak. It was quite good,very lean but full of flavor....and $270 a plate. The steak was great but not so much for that price. Before dinner the waitress handed me a blank menu, and we joked that this must be the diet menu. She apologized and mentioned that the restaurant would take care of our first 2 dinner cocktails. When we got the bill, we noticed that we were charged for the 2 cocktails. We reminded her that she had mentioned that the restaurant would take care of them, but she suddenly didn't recall the offer. It was obvious that she was covering her mistake.  Anyway, I don't think my husband and I will ever come back to this place.",

From the moment we were seated to getting our meals packed, we were given the royal treatment.  Now the menu. We started with tempura fried calamari which came with Sriracha foam (wow what an invention!). We completely devoured the two plates of this appetizer!  I ordered the short rib, one friend ordered the steak and two others the burger. I didn't get a taste of the burgers but oh man do I regret not getting the steak, honestly the best steak I have had... I'm not exaggerating. The flavors, the tenderness everything was on point. Now mind you the short rib wasn't bad at all, the meat was tender and tore of the bone with a sweet cranberry sauce.  Now the service was.... let's just say this. Our glass of waters never emptied past the halfway point, EVERYTIME it got close to...the magical waitstaff immediately re-filled it. Now that's attention to service. Our server was sweet and even provided a free birthday dessert to my friend when we noted that we were celebrating.  Definitely a place to check out. You are paying for quality here.",

Staff: attentive, knowledgeable, courteous, they accommodated us when were were an hour late & even gave us a seat not intended for us.  All the steaks come ala carte, our server tried to upsell us, but the filet ended up coming with a wonderful housemade pesto sauce.  JG knows how to prepare delectable sauces.    The lows of the food: -Caesar, simple, too simple, not much flavor.   -Sweetbreads, menu stated pan fried, they did not have the crust I normally enjoy, but the sauce was so savory, finger lickin' good.   -The side of Bone Marrow was awfully big for a side & what's up the gelatious goop?  The ambiance of the JG is great and will definitely be a popular staple in LV.",

No. It lacks that specific experience, that special flavor, the kick the other steak houses in the teeth inventive memory.  Appetizers: Shrimp Wrapped in Bacon was good. Nothing to really write about good.  The Raw Oysters were fantastic, but for the repetitive broken shell fragments. Has 6 and 5 had this problem. The schucker needs to take property time and this would not have been a problem.  Main Courses.  12 once NY Strip perfectly cooked. Nice Steak. Nothing to state that it was the most amazing, because it wasn't. It was good. Good at 54 dollars? No.  Veal Maleness - good although to me the Veal wasn't the best cut.    Sides were: Mushrooms, excellent but for the hot peppers which overwhelmed the taste of the mushroom.  Creamed Spinach - Bland Mashed Potatoes - Very good  Deserts were good.  Service excellent  Again and again, the Aria fails in the culinary area. Beautiful property, but the restaurants. The Aria needs to examine top side down where the property is obviously failing. I would first shake up the top three in charge of the culinary leadership. Then, hire the right leaders as the restaurants just fail at the Aria all too often.  Yes this is a strong 3 star, but really a 3 star is a failure.  The Aria has incredible competition, and next time I won't be myopic and only choose a restaurant at the place we are staying. Next time..better restaurants.",

    "text": "We are at Jean George's on a Thursday night at 5 Because we had a show at 7 pm. There were 6 of us. Our server Borris was fantastic. His attention to detail was precise. I had shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. Cesar salad for my salad. And for dinner the 8 oz USDA filet cooked medium. Never have I ever had a steak cooked so perfectly. The sauces they serve on the side with the steak were al very good and flavorful. We had 5 sides, my favorites were the Brussels Sprouts and the truffle Mac and cheese OMG YUMMMMMM!!! I've been to quite a few 5 star steakhouses in Vegas and this was my favorite thus far. Our old favorite was Sensi in Bellagio which is now closed. We also got two desserts and they were both excellent. My husband loved his steak as well. We are returning in July and we will be going back for sure. Very relaxing atmosphere. It is pricy but for the service and food we thought it was 100% worth it! The server assistants were wonderful too clearing our plates and refilling our waters! Can't wait to go back!!!!",

We ordered the shellfish platter to share and I ordered the Tomahawk (bone in rib eye) steak.  The steak was impressive.  It really did remind me of a native American tomahawk axe and it was cooked (rare plus) to perfection.  In terms of size, the steak was generous.  It was in between a 4x6 and a 5x7 postcard and was about 1\" thick.    The verdict: Would I go back?  Yes.  The overall dining experience was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to those willing to spend a little more for a special experience.",

    "text": "For a high end name like Jean Georges, this restaurant is ridiculously amateur and low-class.  The substandard food and questionable dimly-lit dining room do nothing to improve the eating experience.    First, my girlfriend and I were poorly greeted by the two hostesses.  When we approached them, one immediately asked, \"Do you have reservations cause we aren't taking walk-ins you know\" in a Paris Hilton-wannabe tone.  I replied politely that I did with a smile.  She rolled her eyes.  The other hostess gave me a wimpy death stare that looked more like the face of indigestion than one of menace.  The first hostess asked us to follow her into the dining room after confirming the name.  She did not properly sit us down, e.g. failed to hand us our menus or pull out chairs, etc.  If she knew anything about proper dining etiquette, she would not have stacked the menus on the plates like some ogre playing Jenga (tm).  She abruptly walked away without saying a word.  Nevertheless, I was determined to salvage this experience.      Unfortunately as the evening marched on, I learned that it was not going to happen.  Our food was sub-par.  The foie gras was okay.  The bread was heavily buttered.  My plate was very greasy the moment I laid the bread piece down.  Unfortunately, this made the already rich course even denser.  The lobster caesar (a special request) was plain, but decent.  My girlfriend and I ordered the New York and filet mignon respectively as our main courses.  They were perfectly cooked, but UNBEARABLY SALTY to the point that they were inedible.  When I complained about the entree to the waiter (slightly over-weight, 30-ish, and bald), he said, \"I am sorry you feel that way\" and walked away.  I could have raised a storm and complained even further, but I decided it was not kosher to cause a scene.   After drinks and dessert, my tab was ~$330 for 2 people.  Now ask yourself this... would you pay that much for a watered-down version of a Jean Georges restaurant with poor food and service?  If you crave for a Vongerichten restaurant, treat yourself to a flight to NY and eat there.  ==== UPDATE ====  I received a message from a dummy account -- which might have been from an employee or someone related to the restaurant -- attempting to shoot down my review.  Here's what he/she wrote:  \"The consistency of this review is totally inacurate. JG had never had a lobster caesar, and hostes don't present dinner menus either, the server does.\" -- Ramon L.  I responded...  \"Before you claim a review is inaccurate, note that your experiences and opinions may be different from mine.  In my case, the hostess planted our menus on our plate.  Our waiter was not even prepared to greet us until a couple of minutes later as he was fussing with two other staff members near the back cashier.  Even if the hostess was not trained to hand us our menus properly, this does not excuse her unprofessional demeanor during the entire greeting process.  Also, the lobster caesar was a request -- it did the job, but it was not special or elevated.  I edited the review to make a note of the 'special request' to avoid further confusion.  Also, if you are questioning the validity of my review, I have photos on my cellphone ([two] of which are uploaded on Yelp!) and a credit card bill. ;)\"",

Our server was very helpful and strongly recommended all the items on the menu marked with an MP for market price. Of course they are. We decided to pass on the $270 6oz Kobe filet but appreciated the recommendation for a steak that runs $720 per lb.   We ordered the truffle Mac and cheese and the creamed corn as our sides. Mac and cheese was delicious, creamed corn was meh. Wouldn't get that again.   I'd give this place 4 stars if our team of servers didn't disappear when it was check time. I think I waited 30 minutes for my check to be delivered.   This place isn't cheap. If I had it to do over again I'd probably go up the strip a bit to Gordon Ramsay Steak and get a better meal for less money. Not that GR is inexpensive by any measure.",

    "text": "I'm definitely a fan of Jean Georges at the Aria! Great food, excellent service, and an all-around great experience. If you're looking for some good eats at the Aria and want to venture off in some of the fine dining they have to offer, Jean Georges is definitely one of those places that delivers.  The Place - Jean Georges is located inside of the Aria Casino on the Promenade Level (2nd Level) across from The Buffet in this, sort of, horseshoe next to a few of the other restaurants. While Yelp describes the place as needing \"dressy\" attire, you can definitely enter the place with a \"business casual\" type of a dress code. If you enter the place with a t-shirt or shorts, you will definitely feel out of place. The restaurant itself is fairly dark and intimate, which is expected with any type of fine dining experience and the furniture and decor is very modern. The bar is a fairly decent size; however, the seats at the bar are spread out spaciously so that you don't feel like you're sitting in someone else's lap when you're enjoying your beverage or eating your meal. At the bar, you're treated with two flat panel TVs mounted back to back to take care of both sides of the countertop. The restaurant itself has a fairly big footprint and can definitely accommodate for any party size. Very cool place, Jean Georges! *****5/5 Stars*****  The Service - I was in town for a conference and the last session ended at 5:15pm. Jean Georges's only service is during dinner with doors opening at 5:00pm. Immediately, after my last session, I went straight to Jean Georges in hopes of being able to just sit at the bar as a walk-in. I checked out their digital menu that is mounted on the wall right outside of the restaurant and after a few brief minutes, I approached the door where I was greeted by several hostesses. I asked if Jean Georges is reservation only or if I could walk-in to the bar and they politely let me know that the bar was open seating, offering the full dinner menu, and that I was more than welcome to have a seat. Hostess interaction is really important to me as it's usually the first impression that you get of the restaurant and Jean Georges delivered flawlessly. I sat myself at the bar where I was then promptly greeted by the bartender, Thomas. He asked if I was staying to eat and gave me a menu to glance over. After that, he gave me the drink menu, gave me a few minutes, and took the initiative of getting me a water in the meantime. I came during Game 1 of the World Series and they had the game on the TVs and the bartenders and patrons were participating in general conversation regarding the game and were all really down to earth. The excellent service continued throughout constantly checking up on me making sure that I was ok. The service in a restaurant is just as important as the food they serve and Jean Georges definitely delivered. Thanks, guys! *****5/5 Stars*****  The Food - Goodness gracious, where do I begin? As I was looking through the menu attempting to figure out what I wanted, the bartender(not Thomas) came around and gave us popcorn (See Picture) to snack on. Now, some of you probably just snickered at the mention of \"popcorn\" at a fine dining restaurant, but trust me, this is popcorn you DEFINITELY wanna try. The popcorn, in addition to it being buttered, is also dusted with Cayenne Pepper and Rosemary giving it a savory kick to your tastebuds. The taste is absolutely addicting and wouldn't mind if they made it available for the public to buy and have it shipped to their house haha. For my main dish, I ordered the Soy Glazed Short Ribs (See Picture) and the Truffle Mac & Cheese (See Picture). The Truffle Mac & Cheese is nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. It's very creamy and cheesy and the truffle is present throughout each bite. The Soy Glazed Short Ribs were nothing short of amazing. The short ribs were perfectly cooked not needing a knife, only your fork, to cut it. The accompanying apple-jalepeno puree was a sweet and savory accent that matched perfectly with the apple slaw that was served on top of the short ribs, which I could've ate just by itself all day haha. The Soy Glaze on the short ribs was absolutely delicious and is definitely what made these short ribs some of the best I've ever tasted and I've tasted A LOT! Haha. The glaze was sweet, tangy, and did not overpower the rest of the dish. It was well-balanced and I HIGHLY recommend it if you're in the mood for some delicious short ribs! Tres bien, Jean Georges.....tres, tres bien! *****5/5 Stars*****  Overall - I'm glad I was in vicinity of this restaurant. There are many places to choose from in Vegas when it comes to a steakhouse. In fact, I believe each major casino on The Strip has their own steakhouse so it makes it hard to choose. If you're in the Aria as a visitor or a guest of the hotel, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out Jean Georges! Thank you for the great food, great service, and a memorable experience.",

My steak was ice cold when it arrived at the table.  After waiting for almost an hour and a half for our entrees to arrive, that sad slab of NY strip was just intolerable.    Similarly disappointing: the quality of the ingredients they serve - they list their steaks as \"prime\" on the menu, but they're  wet-aged (not dry aged), a fact that is only revealed if you hound your waiter to admit it.  The lobster is rock lobster from Australia.  Hello?  We have perfectly amazing lobster in the States - it comes from Maine and it's far superior.  Last but not least:  Australian \"Wagyu\" (or \"wayygoo,\" as our waitress kept misstating) is not, in fact, the real McCoy.  These days you have to travel to Japan and/or have some serious import connections to find actual Kobe beef.    It wouldn't surprise me if this place closes  when JG's contract with MGM expires.  Atrocious, badly-sourced/misrepresented food for the price.",

    "text": "WARNING: The meal for two at Jean-George's Steakhouse contains indulgence and gluttony. First off, the service is fantastic. We had two servers dedicated to us. When you see the bill below, you'll be amazed that she remembered all of it without writing anything down. We started with the sushi sampler, hamachi, tuna tartare, and a Caesar salad. The sushi had two pieces each of salmon, tuna, and yellow tail (I think) on crispy rice. It was very good but surprisingly thin at $24. The hamachi was also very good though not amazing. Tuna tartare was very good as well. I know it's odd, but I was craving the salad. It was actually quite good, but laughable at $16. It must have cost them 75 cents to make it. For our entrees, my cousin had a tomahawk chop rib eye and an 8 oz lobster tail. His ribeye was amazing! I had an 8 oz filet and 8 oz lobster tail as well. Both were quite good. I really enjoyed the sauce selections as well. We mashed potatoes that were excellent. Had to be at least 50% butter. For dessert, he had a warm chocolate cake (with the molten center) and ice cream. I had an apple pie with bourbon ice cream. It was fantastic. This was one of the best meals I've had in Vegas...and I've been to most steakhouses. I admit that I've never been to Gordon Ramsey's place. I highly recommend it. It put Bardot to shame.",

    "text": "I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed in my experience here. I'll get to my food in a minute but first I'll talk about the restaurant itself. You walk into a dimly lit dining area that reminds me of a cave. There are interesting decorations around but I suppose the lighting can be described as intimate. They have a huge wall of wine near the bar area that is pretty impressive. There is ample seating and it doesn't feel like you are crammed together.   The food was alright but nothing overly spectacular. There were some interesting flavors in what we ordered. My boyfriend and I both ordered the same thing but had different experiences.   We had the JG Cheeseburger - Truffle mayonnaise, Brie cheese, Yuzu Pickles and Truffle fries.  We both ordered the burgers Medium but mine came medium rare and the other was medium well. So the texture of the burger was a bit off for both of us.  The truffle mayonnaise was interesting but kinda lost its flavor after a few seconds. The Brie was very nice on my burger but then again I LOVE Brie.  The Yuzu pickles kinda had a sharp flavor to them so I felt like it took away from the flavor of the meat and cheese so I ate them on the side. Now if any of you have read my other posts then you would know that I'm a fry snob and I'll say that I didn't eat many of my truffle fries. The fries were crispy which was nice but the truffle was just kinda garnished over the fries and was a bit hard to eat.   We also ordered a side of the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. This was tasty with shaved black truffle on the top and bread crumbs. I think this was the best part of the meal to be honest but still lacked a certain something.  The burgers are $26 bucks a piece and the Black Truffle Mac & Cheese is $18 bucks.   Over all, it wasn't bad but I wasn't really in a WOW stage by the time I left. I might go back but I don't have a burning desire to do so. Reservations are recommended if you do go and I would suggest going around 6:30 when it isn't quite in the dinner rush yet.",

    "text": "We booked this steakhouse for their delicious steaks for a party of 7 the night before. When we checked in with our 16 month old baby the hostess at the counter told us that children under 5 weren't allowed and that when we booked they should have told us but seems they didn't  This is the 1st time I've even been to a restaurant that doesn't allow babies. Isn't that age discrimination?! Well anyways they only seated us since our other party was already seated but told us that if our kid started fussing we'd have to take him out.   The food was pretty good. I ordered the caesar salad the rib eye med rare. The steak was very tender, juicy and cooked just right. The salad was fresh and the caesar dressing was light and fluffy but the portion was a little small. Overall I would have given this place 5 stars but since the service was so-so and the no baby policy ruined it a bit.",

    "text": "Believe me, as someone who wasn't paying for this meal, I was primed to like it a lot more.  And there's some cool decor and atmosphere, with the wine list on iPads and modern appeal (even though the walls looked disturbingly like the evil twin of a Monster Energy drink can).  Atmospherewise, the music is weird and I think kind of emo.  Which, also, believe me, I would totally have ignored if the food blew me away.  But it just didn't!  I was so excited to try all of the sauces offered for the steak... I am a bearnaise man through and through, and was so excited to try that and the hot sauce, and everything!  However, 5 sauces on my rib eye, and none of them were amazing.  - Also at $60+ for an 18 oz. ribeye is crazy expensive... other places offer a way bigger cut for that much- were just not wowing me.    I will say this, the salted caramel ice cream--- AMAZINGLY GOOD.  Almost pushes this review to 4 stars.  But literally everything else I had was average- bland creamed spinach, truffle mac and cheese that needed more flavor.  I tried one of the dishes on my friend's tasting menue that really put me off too... just tasted like bad sour cream.  I think this place could be great-- and don't get me wrong, I was super grateful for the free meal-- but a little taste and a little more atmosphere could go a long way for some of their stuff.  If it was cheaper, or better atmosphere, or a little more tasty, it would get 4 stars, but mehhh.  I've had better.",

    "text": "We decided to have our last dinner in Vegas at Jean Georges Steakhouse.  What a great decision.    We started off with a Burrata Mozzarella topped with tomato, basil, olive oil and a crostini.  When we received our order it had been split onto 2 plates.  This first course was so delicious, we ordered another round.  For the main course, I ordered the 18 oz ribeye and my wife the 10 oz filet.  Each steak was cooked perfectly to temp, mine mid rare and the wife's to medium.  The steaks were served with 4 dipping sauces to taste.  Each sauce was creative and unique, the soy miso butter and Bearnaise were my favorite.  We decided on the nightly special, truffle mashed potatoes and black truffle/comte fritters as our sides.  These sides were amazing!  The sides actually out performed the steaks.  The only thing keeping me from giving Jean Georges Steakhouse 5 stars is my personal preference for broiled steaks over wood-fired steaks which are served at Jean Georges.    I highly recommend Jean Georges Steakhouse.",

    "text": "Wow. A new favorite, this place was insane.  The service, the food, the drinks - it was a perfect night  We started by sharing the Spinach Salad with Warm Goat Cheese Dressing. It was very over dressed (the only minor disappointment of the evening), but the dressing was very creamy mixed up with salty bacon  We shared the Pork Belly Egg Rolls which we both very much enjoyed.  Now this is where I start to lose my mind.  I ordered the Soy Glazed Short Ribs with apple and rosemary. Favorite entree ever. The sweet glaze on the short ribs was amazing and at one point joked to Mr R, \"...can I order seconds?!\"  He had the Wagyu Filet which was almost as good as my entree.  A perfectly cooked tender steak. We loved it. Despite not being a fan of \"dipping sauces\" at steakhouses, I found two or three of them to be different and really good.  Dessert was awesome, a Salted Caramel Sundae. It was the perfect end to our meal.  We rarely do repeats in Vegas (or anywhere really) but this is one place I will go back to next time we're in Vegas.",

It definitely isn't my favorite though.. i think i even like Ruth Chris' better.   Jean Georges gives you 5 dipping sauces for your steak... none of which blew my mind. I'd say- it's a classic steakhouse but aside from the decor, its lacks a wow-factor.",

Not an entirely bad seat but with the waiter station out in the open and not blocked or hidden in anyway the staff should not be disrespecting customer's in the waiter station.

Why should a customer paying a high end price not get what they asked for? Inexcusable.

Thank you for knowing what guest service truly means.  Management is present and every time I have been there I have watched them make sure they are interacting with the guests.  The food!  I have now had the short ribs twice, and they were the same both times, fantastic.  My wife, fillet all three times.  Boring, you might say, but it was perfect all 3 times.  Which again I say consistency matters!  Pork spring roll, simple and tasty.  Spinach and bacon salad is balanced and doesn't overwhelm before the meal.  Overall, I would go back again for a forth and fifth time.  The service and the food compliment each other.",

When in Vegas, I like to do everything late :) Maybe the somewhat loud music was also because it was later in the evening?   A lot of different servers came to our table which was a little confusing but maybe they were just trying to move us out more quickly? We started with a yummy bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and the tuna tartar and lobster bisque as appetizers. These, along with the bread selection including \"pretzel bread\" were a great start to a great meal.   We ended up choosing the salmon with truffle vinegarette to share as a main dish. The salmon was almost sashimi-rare and was delicious especially with the truffle vinegarette on top. This dish also came with chopped up brussel sprouts which I loved and special mashed potatoes that I'm pretty sure also had truffles in them. Have I mentioned that I love truffles and feel so spoiled every time I eat them?! The bone marrow was also very good and so salty. We had to ask for advice on how to eat it...  We were too stuffed for dessert and actually took our last glass of wine down to the casino floor with us since we didn't want to make all the servers wait for us to finish it...   One final thought =  yummy truffles!!! :)",

From the moment you walk down the long corridor of the beautiful Aria hotel, from afar this restaurant is beautiful! Up close, very elegant and very classy, which rates this steakhouse amongst the best I have ever experienced! A True dining experience!  The dishes are priced on the higher end, but this is not your typical steakhouse! I was told the menu features the highest quality meats and seafood, complimented by a wide array of side dishes and homemade sauces!  Award winning chef Jean Georges Vongeritchen has challenged himself to creating special masterpieces! He has added bold flavors and presentation in his creations! This is not your typical American steakhouse! An unforgettable experience indeed! Dining at its finest!  I started with the Dungeness Crab Cake with ruby red grapefruit and avocado! This starter was to die for!!  For my main entree, I ordered the 12 oz. New York Steak,  with chef's house prepared sauces! Oh my gawd, what an experience! This is not your typical steak experience! No wonder this establishment was rated 5-stars!  To compliment the steak I ordered the  Carmelized Brussel sprouts made with soy-sherry brown butter and pear! Wow, is all I can say!  For dessert, I left it to our server/bartender Darren to order for me, and I was not disappointed!  He ordered the warm Valrhona chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream!!! In the center of the cake was melted chocolate! I am a chocolate lover so ..... :D   This restaurant does offer alternatives if you are not a livestock feeder, from an array of fish, poultry and even lamb ....... to name a few.  I was a little worried when I got to the restaurant as there was already a line forming outside the restaurant at 6:30! It's a good thing we're at the Aria because even if you have to wait to be seated, this is a beautiful hotel! Special props to Darren, our server/bartender!!! I look forward to my next experience here!!! This experience rates a 5-star review in my book, to go with the 5-star dishes and 5-star service by Darren! If you are ever at the Aria, be sure to check out Jean George's Steakhouse!!! :)",

    "text": "Dining on Las Vegas Boulevard can be a different kind of gamble than most patrons are used to experiencing. Do you hedge your bets and save money by going to the buffet that was last cleared by the health inspector in 1973, or do you spend massive amounts of money on fine dining that is so snooty they charge you to use the bathroom while never making eye contact with you? It's a risky venture but if there is one place on The Strip that is a guaranteed jackpot visit for you and your dining party, it has to be Jean Georges Steakhouse. The reasons are many, but if you are the kind of Las Vegas visitor who wants the quick-and-easy soundbites for your adventures, trust me when I say this is worth the time and asking price.  For the rest of us still reading, I'll recap my visit whilst wiping the drool from my mouth as I fondly reminisce about some of these dishes.  My folks and I were looking for a nice steakhouse to close out our last night in town. And being that this was downstairs from our rooms in the ARIA, it was an easy reservation to make. But even without the convenience of proximity, Jean Georges is more than worthy of visiting. When we walked in, the duo of hostesses at the front desk greeted us and escorted us through the dining room to a banquette seat along the back wall. Along the way, we passed through a classy bar area, as well as a couple of dining rooms flanked with booths, tables and the most inviting atmosphere of any upscale dining I have seen in Vegas.  Almost seconds after being seated, Jason came by and welcomed us. Much like the hostesses, Jason was professional, engaging and fully committed to making sure each guest had their expectations exceeded. Since this was our first visit, and I tend to get confused by concepts like revolving doors, we appreciated the overview of the menu Jason provided. I especially was relieved to find out the sigils lining the walls are cow noses - you can totally see that when someone points it out to you. (I spent the first 20 minutes here thinking they were an abstract interpretation of Monument Valley.)  With generously poured cocktails in hand, we set our sights on the food. Mom opted for the butternut squash soup and soy-glazed short rib, Dad chowed down on the caesar salad and wagyu filet, and I decided to attempt cardiac arrest with the bacon-wrapped shrimp and 18-oz. ribeye. In most reviews, I would take the time to itemize each item and give the pros and/or cons, stretching the total word count to somewhere around the 600,000 word total. But everything here was impossibly wonderful. Truthfully, it started with the complimentary basket of breads, stuffed with everything from pretzel rolls to something I forgot the name of from Morocco that engulfed my taste buds in flavor and fire. Even the side orders of asparagus and fries met with our voracious appetites.  (And special note must be made for the quartet of steak sauces brought out - while two were better than the others, the fact that there was so much variety to choose from made for a nice addition. However, that green minty sauce that came in its own silo may be the closest thing to a transcendental moment I have experienced - I think the first bite sent me back in time, though that may have been the second house \"mule\" providing the foundation for this out-of-body experience.)  Unfortunately, with food this good, you are going to want to eat as much as possible. Why is this a bad thing? Well, in our case, due to the aftermath of our gorging, none of us had room for dessert. If tradition holds up, though, I'm sure the desserts are awesome.  Other random observations: the bathrooms are kind of cool, in that there are free-standing sinks atop columns in the middle of the floor. There is a photographer wandering the premises to capture your visit, but she was not obtrusive, at all. And whoever picked the soundtrack gets all the points in my book - until coming here, I never realized how cool life could be until I was eating a steak while the Pet Shop Boys' \"West End Girls\" was playing. (Seriously, the mix of current and classic new wave/synth pop music was excellent.)  I have one slight concern to mention, and it's one I typically harp on like a broken record: no manager came by to our table. I'm not even sure if a manager was walking the floor - my back was to the dining room. I'm sure one was making the rounds, though. In a high class steakhouse, I put a lot of value in a managerial presence speaking with the guests, even if it is just to thank them for coming in. It's a slight hiccup, and it's certainly not going to stop me from recommending this place, but it's just a suggestion to the powers that be to maybe have a bit more visibility in the dining room.  Again, though, that's a minor bump in the road compared to the overall visit we had the pleasure of enjoying. Sure, the pricing may deter some, but Jean Georges Steakhouse is proof you get what you pay for - it is a masterful dining experience.",

    "text": "I do not understand how Jean Georges has such a low rating. Either I am easy to please or people just have unrealistic expectations. My friend wanted to come here for her birthday dinner. I am always down for a good steakhouse and was a little turned off by the low rating, but decided to go along with it anyway.  We made reservations for 7pm Saturday night. We walked in and were seated right away. The decor is amazing. I loved the dark lighting, furniture and the whole vibe was just on point. They have the bar located right at the enterence so you can get a drink while waiting for a table. We were seated at a booth and it was cozy and felt very private. They have a wall lined with bottles  of wine running across the restaurant. It is an upscale place, so make sure to dress up.  Now the important part... the food. To start with, I wanted a good glass of wine. They have an extensive wine list. If you are fan of red, I recommend going with with their Malbec, bitter red and went very well with my steak. We started with the calamari and wagyu carpaccio appetizers. The carpaccio was to die for. Four pieces of fatty meat sitting on top of a creamy vinaigrette dressing. Totally mouthwatering and delicious. Probably the best part of our meal. The calamari was alright. Nothing to rave about, but then again suites us right getting seafood at a steakhouse. I would say skip the calamari and go with another appetizer. For my main entree I went with the 8 ounce Filet Mignon; to die for! It was cooked to medium perfection; was very tender. They brought several dipping sauces to the table. I would recommend their bearnaise sauce, however, the steak did taste better on its own. We got the truffle mac n cheese and mushrooms as our sides. Both were phenomenal. We ended the meal with the chocolate lava cake, with a side of the vanilla ice cream... loved it!  Our whole experience was great. Our waiter, Jason was so attentive, kind and very knowledgable about the menu. They answered all our questions and made sure we got everything the way we like it.",

    "text": "You would think a steakhouse would be no place to find a vegetarian, but in Jean Georges Steakhouse, you would be mistaken. Jean Georges sets out to create the perfect meal for everyone, including that one vegetarian friend you have that you would like to hangout with, but are afraid would be out of place in a steakhouse.  With vegetarian and vegan menus items such as Beet and Strawberry salads, tomato gazpachos, fried tofu, or risotto - Jean George Steakhouse proves that he can make food for everyone. While the tofu was not my favorite given its flan like texture (even though it was advertised as fried tofu), everything else was amazing.  I also love it when restaurants give amuse bouche or free bread. The chef had made an amazing milk bread that pulled apart and melted in your mouth, with whipped butter that was spread easily on the warm bread. The amuse bouche was a gazpacho shooter that blend watermelon and tomatoes.  The dessert was fantastic with a warm lava chocolate cake that would be any chocolate lovers favorite.  So in the future if you are craving steak, but are worried about your vegetarian friend, go to this steakhouse where everyone can have an excellent meal!",

As I was greeted by the host and hostess I was warmly greeted and invited to sit in the bar, which I wanted. Since I was alone this was my best option. Moving forward, I was immediately sized up by the bar keep whom of which was in deeply engrossed in a private conversation with other patrons. I ordered a very expensive bourbon and then another. I asked to see the wine menu and ordered a $25 glass of wine which I indicated I wanted with my meal. Then all of a sudden there it was everything all at once. No savoring the atmosphere or even the meal my food was cold as though it was waiting there for me to order and all of a sudden I felt rushed and undervalued. The guests to my left and to my right received in matched attention. For $216 I'll go to Ruth Chris.",

I made my Saturday evening dinner reservation just hours before dining so that should have been telling.    Food was bad.  Expensive AF, and bad.  I've eaten at Old Holmstead, Golden Steer, Gordon Ramsay, Echo and Rig and several other decent steakhouse joints in town and somehow this steak managed to be the most expensive without the whole tasting good part.  I spent 60 bucks on a mushy steak.  I ordered two sides to share with my babe at 20 additional bucks a piece and they weren't big enough to share.  I spent $20 on five strips of asparagus.  I should be ashamed of myself.  Ugh.  Wine was ridic expensive and the cheapest glass of Rose was $45.  Legit, 45 bucks.... cheapest glass.  I get Rose is annoyingly trendy in today's world but when you serve bad food, at least provide a $20/glass option.  Where's my Summer House Whispering Angel at??  The atmosphere managed to suck too.  Just boring.  Waiter was annoyed the whole time even though we blew $500 bucks at this place.   Menu was super uninspiring.  I should have sent my steak back and I only have myself to blame for not doing so.    If you're reading this review and was heavily considering choosing this establishment as your big Vegas dinner, applaud yourself and go elsewhere.... Outback should do it.",

This was absolutely delicious! Talk about having your meal prepared the right way. My daughter choose to have a steak, so she selected a 12 ounce New York Strip with a baked potato. She said the steak was tender, juicy and absolutely delicious. I took her word for it because she is the most picky eater I have ever seen. Her friend had the Bacon wrapped shrimp, which is an appetizer, but the shrimp were huge. I guess you would call them super jumbo. She said they were delicious. The two of them had a glass of Merlot wine, while I chose to have a glass of Stella Artois (beer). Because we were celebrating my daughter's birthday, the waiter brought her a complimentary \"Happy Birthday\" dessert which I believe was cheesecake. After a few seconds, it was gone. Another delicious choice.  This steakhouse is located within the Aria Casino and Resort. Since we stayed at the Aria, this was a great choice for my daughter's birthday dinner. The restaurant is very big with plenty of seating. It's great for large or small parties. Overall, this steakhouse was a great choice. I will be back for another round of Sea Bass.",

The best meal I've ever had was at Jean Georges in NYC, my meal at Prime is in the top 10, and one of my favorite entrees is a good steak (especially dry aged) so I was eager to try this steakhouse. I started with the wedge which was bland. Needed salt and more blue cheese. Then came my \"rare\" dry aged strip steak. The waiter was thoroughly disinterested in us to begin with and did not ask us to cut into our steaks. Although there was a small line of rare meat in the middle, the rest was gray. We could not get our waiter's attention, but another waiter came over and explained that we just don't know what dry aged beef is supposed to look like. Oh really? My mild mannered husband had reached his limit and asked for the manager. She did bring us 2 new steaks. Same thing. The middle had zero flavor. And the outside was not charred, but more like a charcoal briquette - bitter and burned. Their steaks are accompanied by 4 disgusting sauces. Our friend's sea bass was dry. We were not charged for the steaks, but what a horrible experience. I left hungry.",

The menu is a silhouette of a cow, which made the cute bone marrow-looking dip holders interesting.  Skipped appetizer but had the lychee bellinni. refreshing but wimpy in terms of alcohol, which i like  meal: got the 8-oz Filet Mignon. Fantastic! the meat was well done (they butterflied it for me) but very moist and juicy.   my side was the Black Truffle & Comte Fritter. these delectable balls of goodness melted in your mouth. the truffle taste was perfect. i wish they gave more but there were about 8 or so on the plate. so i got my fill  i tried the hubby's salt and pepper baked potato. interesting. the entire skin is encrusted with S&P. i might try this at home  no one ordered the broiled bone marrow, but i have tasted bone marrow before and i am sure it was probably good there.  i love the sauces they gave and i slathered mine in the soy-miso butter. i recommend that sauce. the miso on the filet was excellent.  dessert: the group shared the lava cake. always good. but who can go wrong with souffle?  very expensive here, though. come ready to plop more than $100 per person...",

    "text": "Dinner for Two and a bottle of wine = $450 not including tip . What more can I say? It's Las Vegas, Everything is ridiculously overpriced. Was the price worth the hype ? Hell No.   Jean George has made a name for itself nationwide for having best and highest quality of food. I guess when opening the Jean Georges steakhouse in Las Vegas, it became all about the decor and not the quality of the food.  When you walk into Jean Georges, just by looking at the beautiful and extravagant decor, you know you're not walking into a budget friendly environment.  We chose this place because the Jean Georges in New York has amazing quality of food so we expected the same here.  We ordered the steak, it was pretty good. It just lacks that \"wowwwwwww\" factor. When it's a $$$$ type of restaurant, you're expecting to leave with that taste of satisfaction that the price of the meal isn't even relevant.  The service was impeccable. The waiter attended to us the entire night. With me being picky, we had a hard time picking the right bottle of wine, so we sampled and purchased many glasses of wine before picking the right one. And thanks to the expertise of our waiter,  we found the perfect bottle of wine for us.  I personally wouldn't return here again, this is nothing like the other Jean Georges owned restaurants. It's all about decor, service and mediocre food here just like many of the other Las Vegas restaurants.",

Let's get our steak on!  The bread appetizers were interesting and delicious. I am a bread person, so a big plus.  Everything is ordered a la carte, so he got the lamb, and I got an 8 ounce steak and creamed spinach. My dishes were delicious. His lamb was outstanding. I liked the green dipping sauce the meats came in. It definitely added another rich dimension to the meat. Both of us have smallish appetites, so the portions they gave us were perfect.   There is an attention to detail, which I love about this restaurant. I do feel well taken care of, and extremely comfortable. Definitely a place I would come back to.",

It was my first time to dine in this restaurant and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  The Black Truffle Comte Fritters were to die for.  I wish I just ordered 4 servings of those for my whole meal.  I love Lamb Chops cooked and seasoned right. Their Colorado Lamb Chops had Olives on them which I was not a fan of so I opted for their chargrilled version to play it safe.  I don't know if the server was just not a great one but when I asked what the chef would recommend in terms of temperature whether rare or medium rare-the server replied that \" it was my preference and he could not give any recommendations.\" He also failed to tell me that the lamb chops did not come seasoned at all.  When my rare lamb chops came, not only did it taste a bit gamey, it had NO TASTE! I compensated with their dips which were a bit spicy for my taste.  Call me crazy but the server did not ask us how our meal was during or after we dined.  Being on vacation, I was too tired to bring this to their attention and didn't want to ruin the good vibe our group had.  I hope this restaurant find better servers who can inform you of the chef's recommendations and let you know that the chargrilled meats do not come seasoned at all.  I've dined in a ton of 5 star restaurants, this restaurant's service seemed cold-maybe the staff wanted to get out early since it was the 4th of July.",

During this time watched people come in with dirty jeans and just bum looking. We really tried to find a nice/elegant restaurant for a special occasion but it seems like people don't like to dress up anymore. I don't care if they have money or not, but at least dress up for dinner. So after the long wait, we were seated only to wait even more time for our server to stop by and say hello. Another 20 minutes had gone by before we been offered a glass of water. By this time I was ready to just leave and talk to the manager on the way out....but like  dummies we stuck around. We finally had the chance to order the food and we decided to do the chef's special of food/wine pairing and of course, they fckd that up too. They brought out the wine either too early or too late and never actually got to taste it with our food. The entire service was horrible and the waiter kept apologizing but nothing changed...he felt he would remedy the situation by bringing us an extra dessert that we didn't want.  We just wanted to leave. We spent close to $500 for the meal for two and it the entire experience SUCKED! Save yourself the money and seriously read the yelp reviews before you go!

I asked if they could make it without the cilantro, and the waiter was pretty rude and told me that they don't make the sauce fresh, so they can't make it without any ingredients.  I would think an expensive restaurant like this would make their sauces fresh and would accommodate patrons. I agree with everyone else-- the music was too loud.  I couldn't carry on a conversation with my guests at all.   If you're looking for a good steakhouse, try the one at Circus Circus.

We started with several appetizers, the tuna tartare being the only outstanding one of five ordered. We love octopus salad and order it when ever available. At Jean George it was very disappointing, tough and rubbery, not at all what we expected. But the reason I am writing this review is the Thanksgiving menu, featuring the driest dark meat we have ever experienced. I asked for extra gravy, but even drowning the meat in gravy did not help. The only item my husband and I ate from our plate was the stuffing. Our dinner companions all decided to order steak and they were happy with the steak but the sides were disappointing.The Mac and cheese in particular was the worst we'd ever eaten, extremely salty and soupy. My husband and I were very unhappy with our meal and if we would not have been with other dinner guests we would have sent our dishes back.",

    "text": "One of the best steakhouses I've ever been to. And if you follow my reviews, you know I love me some steak.  Their cuts, their food, their wine list: all notable. I would have given them a 5 star review even if the service was average.  The ambiance is sexy, modern, unique, mysterious... very pleasing to the eye.  And the menu has enough to tantalize even the pickiest of palates.  Their crispy sushi plate was pretty amazing. Salmon, Tuna, and i think yellowtail...  so good with a crunchy texture underneath.  Pretty delicious.   The truffle mac and cheese was to die for.  the steaks were moist and delicious.  That tomahawk steak (australian wagyu hybrid) soooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and juicy.  And huge.  Definitely share able.  What really stands out about Jean George is their staff (except the young host).  We made a reservation on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> for 10:30PM and we arrived at 10:30PM...  The problem is... they close at 1030PM.  The hostess was being kind of wacky.  But she said the manager said it was ok....  so long as we hurry.  ok??  Anyways... the servers treated us like they never close. Not at any point did I feel rushed. And every request was handled quickly and with gravity.  When I asked for a wine recommendation:  The server brought over the house sommelier.  I was so impressed. She made an immaculate recommendation within our budget.  And it paired so well with our meal. This place deserve all the accolades it receives.  Great place.",

    "text": "The girlfriend and I chose Jean Georges Steakhouse for dinner for our first day in Vegas.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our 7:45 reservations.  The hostess informed us that our table would be available at our reservation time, but we could wait in the bar.  So we did, but decided against ordering any pre-dinner drinks.  Less than five minutes after our reservation time rolled around, the hostess tracked us down and led us to our table.  After a quick review of the menu, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu with wine pairing.   Our first course, Almas Ara Caviar over a Meyer Lemon Gelee with creme fraiche, and dill and served in a hollowed out lemon half, arrived at the table. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIH...</a> It was beautifully presented.  More importantly, the contrasting tastes and aromatics of this successfully executed dish really kicked the meal off on an impressive note.  Unfortunately, our paired wine didn't arrive with the food, instead being delivered by our server halfway through our first course with basically no introduction beyond the appellation and varietal.  Our second course, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well executed and nicely presented as well, but the dish wasn't all that original in concept and didn't provide the \"wow\" of the first course.  Sadly, like our first course, our paired wine again didn't arrive with the food and again it arrived without much of an explanation mid-course by a different server than the first.  The third course, a roasted Chilean Sea Bass topped with grilled Maitake mushrooms and a miso-yuzu glaze, sounded outstanding in its description, but was the night's biggest miss. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#GetRHNqeg8V60PcU-iEc0w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIH...</a> The fish was cooked perfectly, but its topping was excruciatingly salty to the point of being inedible.  It was so salty that even after scraping it off of the fish, it was still salty to point that it overwhelmed the delicately flavored sea bass.   At least by this course, the wine arrived with the food (delivered by the second server), as was the case with subsequent courses.  Our fourth course, the grilled Wagyu Filet Mignon with grainy mustard and warm potato salad in textures, was a great rebound as our steaks were dead-on perfect medium rare, tender and flavorful. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#Uy27bZHUGqAet7HnHcT-pw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIH...</a>  It was paired with the best wine of the night, a Cote du Rhone.  This course was the best marriage of food and wine of the night!  Our dessert course was the JG Candy Bar, which I can only describe as six deconstructed candy bars kluged together like a sweet, rich Frankenstein's monster. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIHO-6T_KEfPC9jyGDamQ?select=nG5XPIh7eAP-BtEhpvOAXQ#SmNL9RpX6i_VDuiZDsb_SA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/qmIH...</a>  It was paired with a Madera.  While the food was, for the most part, well executed, and the wine was generally enjoyable, the service side of the house seemed awkward and lacking the depth of knowledge one would expect from a fine dining establishment like this one.  The gf and I aren't really wine snobs, but we do enjoy wine with our food.  If we enjoy a particular wine that we're served in a restaurant, we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home.  Therefore, it was a huge foul that the service staff wasn't more familiar with the wine that was being paired with the food since we really enjoyed the Cote du Rhone served with the filet.  In the end, I felt the Tasting Menu especially with the wine pairings was a poor value.  While we certainly never felt rushed, I got the distinct impression that Jean Georges Steakhouse was more concerned with getting diners in and out rather than providing a truly memorable dining experience.  What a shame.",

It's really dark mostly lit by candlelight and there is a photographer that takes couple pictures going from table to table.  My boyfriend took me here for our 1 year anniversary and we each ordered an appetizers (tomato bisque, cessation salad with chili powder), an entree(filers mignon, and rib eye cut steak), and dessert which looked normal but tasted amazing (chocolate lava cake, sour cherry cheesecake). The appitizers were good but nothing too special for 4 star dining. The filers mignon was very tender and very easy to eat.  My rib eye cut was cooked perfectly to medium rare and came with miso cream sauce and a really great bernaise on the side.  They also give you a basket if breads with your meal. The pretzels bread was great, very fresh and soft. The flatbreads go well with the appetizers.   I would have to say the desserts were amazing. I was surprised at how good they tasted because they looked so normal on the plate. The cheesecake was very moist, soft, and had a great flavor to it as did the molten chocolate lava cake!   The bill would be around $200 per couple but definitely worth the experience.",

What caused me to rate this restaurant two stars is the hostesses standing at the entrance. Before I am even seated, I am put in a sour mood by them. And I'm not saying it was once or that it is just one person. I have returned to this restaurant several times and every time, I am greeted by a rude glammed up woman who speaks as if she owns the restaurant. I have been refused a table for two different reservations before, being told that the restaurant is fully booked for the evening, then after speaking to someone of higher authority, given an empty table and witnessing a not even half full dining area. You may think, maybe the restaurant will fill up. Wrong. During the duration of an approximately 2 hour long meal, the restaurant is still barely filled 50%. So what should you take away from my review? The restaurant serves quality food, but I hope somebody will address the poor service at the door.",

    "text": "There are a plethora of steakhouses in Vegas. I was staying at Aria and my stay included a resort credit that i opted to use at Jean Georges. If someone is looking for a truly romantic spot for dining, this is truly the place. First off, the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. It's dimly lit and illuminated by candlelight for a fully romantic effect. Now, like most Vegas casino steakhouses, one must be prepared to pay a premium. Since i was using my resort credit i didn't have to worry about that. Now to the meal.   Appetizer: bacon wrapped shrimp. Absolutely delicious, but ridiculously priced for such a small portion. I know it's an appetizer, but damn! Lol!  Main Course:  New York strip. I only eat medium rare steak, with an emphasis on rare. But when i got my steak and cut near the tip, it just didn't have nearly the pink that it should have had. I flagged the waiter down and he suggested i cut more away from the tip. Sure enough it was cooked perfectly the rest of the way. However, i was disappointed that it wasn't pink all the way through. I didn't voice my concern to the waiter and was fully prepared to enjoy the steak. Here's what seperates great service from mediocre service: Apparently he had observed my look of disappointment after i cut into the meat, because lo and behold, a few moments later the manager came over and profusely apologized and offered to totally redo it. Wow! talk about service!! I was sooooo impressed. i informed her that that wasn't necessary and that the steak was really welled seasoned and very juicy. And it was. They brought out several types of steak sauces, but none were required because the flavoring of the steak was really good by itself.  I definitely recommend this restaurant, especially if you are already staying at Aria. Really no need to venture out elsewhere.",

    "text": "We had the Signature Tasting menu with wine pairings.  That's $125 & $55 per person.  Most dishes dishes were \"good\" with the exception of our Wagyu tenderloin & dessert.  Although the steaks were cooked to order (medium-warm pink) we thought the seasoning was overly salty.  The beef itself was dry/tasteless, not juicy at all -Perhaps this accounts for the over done salt.  I'll have a much better steak at Fleming's or Ruth Chris.  I expected something \" more\" here with the Wagyu tenderloin. The Sommelier was spot on with the wine pairings.  My only complaint is that there is too much wine per \"tasting\".  It was at least a 4oz pour with the wine -times four -including Champagne & Madeira. We had to ask the server to slow it down as they were bringing the glasses for the next tasting before we could finish the last wine.  This was our second wine pairing dinner and I think it will be our last as it is too rushed for the quantity of wine.  The dessert of chocolate mousse & mint ice cream was a \"Fail\".  The mousse was dense & dry.  Ice cream was tasteless/icy & \"crumbly\". Chocolate wafers, chocolate cookie crumbs, and crunchy chocolate pearls-way too much.  Sorry but this dessert was something a 5 year old would have put together.  More stuff is just....well more.  Service was ok. I know multiple servers must work well for the restaurant but not so much for the customer.  No one really checking back in with you.  Overall the experience lacked any \"wow\" factor for the expense.",

Our waiter meant well but needed to talk about 1/10 as much as he did and use 1/10 less words longer than 10 letters long.  He did mean well but it was painful every time he came to our table and he was ALWAYS at our table.  He was just trying to hard.  The steak was incredible though.  I've gotten into my fair share of big name steaks this year and this was the best.",

Got a not-so-nice table next to some drunk people talking extremely loud, requested a change of table and no problem at all.   Must try their homemade soda! Cherry yuzu flavor is really delicious...  Seafood tower is definitely outstanding! Loved it. ^_^  Bone marrow is good. Fatty and flavorful. Comes with a few slices of crunchy toast. Yummm...  Bone in ribeye and bone in filet mignon are as good as other top steakhouses. Very nice.   Mushroom as side - what a joke. Very small portion and nothing really special. Could have skipped it.   Lastly, interesting logo on their menus and decor. Guess what it is?   Hint: a part of a cow's body.",

    "text": "I always have to eat at a steak place at least once when I'm in Vegas. Decided to try this place out because MGM was footing the bill. Came in early and sat at the bar because I wanted to be in and out as quick as possible.  I wasn't really that hungry so I ordered the tasting menu. Tuna tartare was prepared in the same generic fashion found in any number of restaurants. Tuna + citrusy/tomatoey/cilantro mix + some form of avocado + chip(s). The best part about this dish was the shrimp chip. Very light and crisp.  The foie gras was good. The portion was pretty small, even for a tasting menu. Sea bass was good. Nice crust and the broth complemented the fish well. The steak on the tasting menu was a petite filet. The filet was good, for a filet. It was cooked properly. The grilled mushroom that came with it was pretty good. The desert item was one of those chocolate lava cakes w/ ice cream. I'm not particularly fond of sweets, but the cake was really good. The cake wasn't too flourly and it was packed with oozing chocolate.  I enjoyed watching it ooze, probably more than I should have.   The guys working at the bar were cool and very attentive. The blond waitress was the hottest girl I remember seeing in Vegas that weekend. Gorgeous, stunningly elegant in that dress she had on, and she looked unbelievably good serving my meat.   Next time I'm ordering a bigger piece of meat, none of that petite shit.",

I had drinks in the bar and dinner in the dining room.  The drinks were AWESOME.  Delicious and stiff, just what you want for a $15 cocktail.   Try the cucumber martini.  It is sooooooo better than the sticky sweet cucumber swill other places pass off on you.  Even a man could drink one of these with a modicum of respect. They serve truffle popcorn at the bar.  Who in their right mind doesn't love that?  The bartenders were just-chatty-enough and gave us some awesome dinner recommendations for our reservation later.  Once we moved to the dining room, service was attentive but not omnipresent.  The wine list was solid.  The menu is fairly typical of an upscale steakhouse.  Thanks to the bartenders we had lots of good recommendations and enjoyed everything we ordered.  (sea bass, rib eye, and filet mignon)  The ambiance is nice, very dark, woody, and steakhouseish.  The Chairman of the Board provides the soundtrack.  I felt like I was over at the Wynn or the Bellagio with the music.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  I've been to Prime, the other steakhouse that Jean Georges V-whatshisname is lord and master of in Vegas, and I prefer this one.",

    "text": "The staff did an incredible job at making this a memorable night for my wife and I. When I made the reservation, I mentioned that it was our anniversary. The waitress congratulated us right away, as did a couple of the other supporting staff. The service throughout the night was above-average as well. For example,  I noticed a fleck of cork when I was testing our wine bottle's first pour; I didn't make a big fuss, but nevertheless, he quickly changed out my glass and later brought me a complementary glass of another label. Also, they gave us a complementary chocolate cake and ice cream with \"Happy Anniversary\" hand-written in chocolate on the plate (something I didn't even request). A+ for service.  As for the food, it was wonderful. My wife had the rib eye and I had the filet; both were excellent. I highly recommend the soy miso sauce, one of the four sauces they bring to the table. I tasted great on my steak, and I'm sure it would make an excellent pairing with any seafood dish as well. The green jalapeno sauce was my second favorite. Would recommend the black truffle cheese fritters as a side dish too, they were delicious. A for food  I noticed a few reviews that complained about the music. I honestly did not feel that it was too loud, although the choice of songs at times seemed a bit mis-matched with the overall look of the place.   I already am giving this place a 5, but a couple of things I would recommend them to do. One, get rid of the old-school Vegas photograph lady that hit us up 3 times during our visit. Her deep, raspy voice reminds me of why I never want to smoke again. Two, at times there were too many waiters and bus boys huddling around the cashier/service station in the middle of the restaurant - it was a bit distracting to the eyes.  B+ for ambiance",

    "text": "About average so far as steakhouses go. My rib eye was very tasty but a little over cooked. I didn't complain because the flavor was still fantastic. I thought the process were quite out of order. I've had better for sell. Over all I'd say they are more for show than content. If you want to have a great high end steak I'd recommend Ruth Chris, LG's, Flemings, or Morton's. If you want to show off how much money you have to or make it rain, Jean Georges is the place. The offered a pork chop for $99 and a special cut steak for $199.  For those prices I'll personally fly anywhere in the country and serve you the best steak you ever had. If you were not born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you have good financial values, you should probably go somewhere else. If your friends are named Justin B, Diddy, or snoop, and your second car just happens to be a Bentley, You'll fit right in. Service good, Ambiance great, Food Fantastic, Service A+, Bottom line, Oh Damn! Bring the Platinum or the Black Card.",

    "text": "I'll start with a brief description of the food, but then retell the story of the worst service I think I have ever received and how they tried to scam us out of $200.  The appetizers and sides were pretty good, we got a variety of what they had on offer. Some of the sides, the carrots and potato options were very good actually. The salads were ok at best. I was at Jean Georges with a work group, maybe about 8 of us. We all had steaks which were overcooked. It wasn't enough to send it back for anyone, but they were all overcooked (I actually don't mind a medium steak being a bit overdone anyway). Food wise, I would say it was ok, but there are better options, especially at that price range.  The reason Jean Georges gets ONE STAR is because of the service/scam they tried to pull. We asked for a bottle of a dessert wine which was listed on the menu at about $60 which is the normal price for this wine. There was some confusion about the exact year/quality being ordered because the menu did not give the quality (these wines scored 3-7 by sweetness) but eventually the waitress found the wine and we confirmed it was what we expected. When the bill came, they tried to charge $250 for the wine, an OUTRAGEOUS price.   We told the waitress she made a mistake, she brought the menu back and made some story about how the wine we ordered was different from what was listed which was 1) entirely False and 2) we were never told that they thought it was a different wine. If a restaurant is under the impression they're serving a wine that's different from what's ordered, how can you serve that without telling anyone?! The waitress refused to be reasonable so we asked to talk to the manager. After a great deal of arguing, the manager seemed to imply the menu was wrong and insisted on the $250 price. Eventually the manager simply gave up and charged us the correct $60 price, but, firstly, you should be comping a $60 dessert wine on an 8 person meal over $1,000 anyway! And after such an ordeal, good service says to comp the wine then!   We all left feeling frustrated and insulted.",

For the steep price, it more resembled a tapas plate than an actual meal--very tiny portions of food, barely more than a few bites of each.  I'll give them credit for attractive plating, but these courses were not groundbreaking, nor were their flavors especially memorable.  At times, they were simply confusing: the fruit course, for example, was a tangle of sour and savory, with barely a hint of sweetness, and the dessert course was inedible.  The tuna tartare was decent enough, and the main attraction--their wagyu beef tenderloin--was excellent, but I certainly wouldn't rank it above any other filet mignon I've had at an ordinary steakhouse.    The wait staff was certainly friendly and attentive, and the ambiance was great.  Overall, our party did have a terrific evening, but we would have enjoyed ourselves just as much at the Aria's buffet.  It's not that this restaurant didn't serve good food; it just didn't serve memorable food.  When you're paying the staggering prices this place is asking, you have every right to expect a stunning meal, and we were left wanting so much more than it delivered.  Jean-Georges, I believe, is trying to fight above its weight class.",

This time I would say it was very good but fell short of expectations. Everything was fine: service, food and ambiance but it all felt sort of standard steak house. For the price I want to be blown away.   I will say that the highlight of the meal was the roasted bone marrow.  Best we've had anywhere. Love the interesting design of the restaurant too. Very good meal that fell a little short of expectations.",

I also ordered some truffle mashed potatoes that were to die for. My husband ordered carpaccio and it was the best dinner ever! We also got a bottle of Moet. Dinner was expensive but worth every penny. The service was perfect and our waiter was an absolute nice man not compared to another waiter and service at Carbone, overall I would def. come back here and dine in. I'm glad it was also at the hotel and didn't have to walk far to eat a good dinner",

Jean George should be horrified by the experience we just had. Our reservation was at 7:45. When we showed up the two female hostess, too young to know what good customer service looks like, told us we were wrong and that our reservation was for 8 o'clock.  We should have left but we were excited to eat at this restaurant because we heard so much about it. Our meal was horrible. My steak was supposed to be medium to well and it was rare. My boyfriend ordered rare and his was well done, chewy and tough. The service was horrible except for Keith which is the absolute only saving grace of this restaurant and he's only been there for 6 days!! In a world of fine dinning enjoy your evening at a restaurant that can back up the name by food worth your money. Does this look medium well to you?",

He enjoyed every bite.  The staff was excellent our servers Rachel and Ramon had a lot of experience,information and were just great. It was also, nice to meet the manager Jared who came by to congratulate us on our Anniversary. They  all made us feel very special, especially chef Robert.

We were greeted by our server Seana and was introduced to her partner and another woman I'm gonna assume she was a buser. (I'm bad with names). Seana was very informative of the menu. We had the wagyu carpaccio, short ribs, tomato salad, and oysters as appetizers and for the main courses we had the rib eye and New York strip. It was grilled and seasoned perfectly. We also had the bone marrow, truffle Mac and cheese, and Brussel sprouts. Everything was amazing. The service was amazing very attentive and the glasses of whatever we were drinking never even got a chance to go empty.  Everything about this place is phenomenal. Thank you for the amazing experience.",

    "text": "As expected, the steaks are what they're known for and they surely delivered on their rib eye steaks and New York strip steaks. Our group of 9 really enjoyed our food. We shared some sides and the truffle mashed potatoes were so good that when everyone was done I licked the spoon and plate clean.. okay, well maybe just the spoon. My friends might have pulled the plate away from me.  The nigiri sushi stacked on crispy rice was a stand out pairing with the steaks. My husband and I arrived late from out of town so our friends ordered us a rib eye and the sushi to create a \"surf and turf\" experience and we were very happy! The sushi was simple but the fish was fresh and the crispy rice provided a nice texture to offset the delicate tender sushi pieces of hamachi, maguro, and sake (salmon) - so a modern touch to classic nigiri staples.   The ambiance of the restaurant - dark, mysterious, and chic. Lots of artistic touches around the restaurant to gander at while waiting for food and catching up with old friends or also great for romantical dins.  Since we came late, I'm not sure how crazy my friends had been before we arrived, but our waiters did not seem pleased with us being there. I felt like it was a hassle that I ordered food and there was rushed feeling when I ordered my drink. I had the Boulevardier and had trouble pronouncing it so the waiter corrected me but in a tone that brought me back to grade school in English class when my teacher would correct my pronunciations. I still have trouble pronouncing Boulevardier now but geez! I realize that it must be hard dealing with people that are drunk all the time... I mean we are in Vegas... but I had a good excuse, I was just tired from the long drive to Vegas. I was hungry and was not drunk, so I apologize for being an inconvenience. I apologize for my friends enjoying too many cocktails and ordering so much food at the restaurant that we took 3 hours there.   In summary, the food and decor was super memorable! The front hostesses were super friendly. The guys who cleared are table were quick to clean and efficient. Our waiters seem to strongly dislike our group so service was awkward and slow but just for us. Your experience may be entirely different so please disregard my service comment. I still do recommend this place because the food and ambiance was really good.",

They have a great menu with a lot of fancy stuff on it. It's also very expensive to eat here but you have to expect that (which we did). My only hesitation is that I've had much better steaks which cost a third of what mine did here.",

The best part of my meal was the bread. I ordered sea bass and my husband a strip steak. My fish was slimy and his steak was tough. We also ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes and they were both just ok. The service was also less than desirable, I guarantee it's better at the local chain restaurant. Overall, for the price and service it's worth a small fraction of the price... and we frequent high end restaurants around the country quite frequently",

    "text": "Quick overview: Ehh buyer beware...117 reviews are \"not recommended\" meaning they don't show up unless you scroll all the way down and they happen to all be 1 stars. Meaning this place is probably more accurately described as a 1-2 Star. Three of us spent a total of $700 and the quality of the steak itself just wasn't quite there.  Details: Overall, I give it 3 stars when compared to other big steak houses such as Prime (5+ stars in my opinion, I would suggest Prime at Bellagio over Jean Georges anyday).  Pros:  I would highly recommend the tuna tartare, the squash soup, and the Chilean sea bass (small portion about the size of my palm but loaded with flavor). The presentation of the items were very unique and creative which added to the overall experience.  The atmosphere was great, modern with some hip music (sometimes rap-ish which was a little odd) playing in the background, and the service was excellent but pretty slow.  Cons:  Common themed I've heard about and now agree with, the quality and prices don't quite align. The porterhouse was good but not great for $150, the meat didn't quite \"melt in my mouth\" like it does at Prime/Morton's.  The \"hand cut fries\" were definitely not handcut (they were literally frozen crinkle fries, idk why they serve them there. I assume it was a one-time thing, maybe they ran out of potatoes or something lol)  Again, 3 stars relative to Prime or Morton's",

    "text": "Food is good, but service is HORRIBLE.  We were celebrating our friend's 40th birthday at this restaurant after a phenomenal experience at the Scottsdale location. Our reservation was at 6:45 pm. We arrived on time and still had to wait on a table.   To say the level of service was subpar is an understatement.   We mentioned to our waiter we had to leave at 9 pm. A 6:45 pm dinner reservation should be plenty of time to accomplish this.  They poured our water quickly and took our drink orders.  We received our drinks a few minutes later, but then waited 45 minutes until they came to take appetizer orders.  At that point is when we had to ask to bread service with our appetizer order.    I asked to speak to a manager and then explained the situation above.  He did not initially apologize and simply stated that he would \"look into this.\"    He questioned our servers and then returned to state, \"I don't know what is going on, but I am sorry and dessert is on me.\"  It was at that point I informed him we still didn't have bread service, which came shortly thereafter (now almost an hour into us being seated).  I thought all was well after this, but it's gets worse...  At this point, we had to get in both our appetizer and dinner options at the same time.   My friend and I ordered butternut squash soup. They brought us white bean soup. We had to wait on them to make the correct soup.  Then came the remaining appetizers, but no plates.  We only had our bread plates to eat off of.    I would also like to point out that at no time were we given any information on specials or details about the menu.  Not once did they ask us if we had any questions about the menu.  There was never a point during our dining experience that anyone asked us how the food was or if we needed anything else.  We repeatedly had to ask for water to be refilled.    One friend ordered the sea bass and another had a filet.  Both arrived cold and had to be sent back.  If I had to guess, the kitchen made those entrees with our appetizers and held them back until the appetizers were served and cleared.     The sea bass came back at a decent time.  The friend with the filet didn't get her entree until everyone else was finished with their meals and now it was 8:50pm and they were going to have to rush bringing out dessert.      The desserts came out and then we sent our husbands out to call an Uber so we could quickly get to the show since we are already running behind.  It was after that that they brought out the \"birthday dessert\" at 9:10pm, but it was too late for that given we had already sent the birthday boy and his friends out of the restaurant.  One would think the birthday dessert would be brought out with the rest of the desserts.  We asked for the bill and were informed it takes approximately 8 minutes to process a room charge.  I was expecting that they would have removed the filet for my friend that was sent back cold and didn't return until much later, and possibly also removing the sea bass given that was initially served cold also.  Neither were removed from the bill.  We asked for the manager and he acknowled that he was aware those entrees were sent back.  He adjusted the bill and then we confirmed the desserts were comped, and quickly headed out of the restaurant.  Wait, it gets worse.....  My friend was reviewing the bill later that evening and noticed a charge for a wine bottle we never had - for $535.  We had ordered 2 bottles of wine, which were on the bill correctly.  We never had a 3rd bottle and certainly not for $535.  That charge had to be disputed with the hotel the following morning.   Last but not least, the bathrooms were a mess. Toilet paper all over the floor and dirty toilets.  Certainly not what you expect in a high end steakhouse.    I don't expect to pay close to $2,000 for a meal and get service like this for a party of 8.  This ruined our friend's 40th birthday.  Service was so bad that they should have provided our entire meal complimentary.   We were late to our show and missed the opening act.  While multiple conversations with the manager resulted in them removing the 2 cold entrees and comping our desserts, this does not rectify the experience we had for our friend's 40th birthday celebration.",

Overall it's spend but a great experience given the convenience for guests.",

    "text": "We had a amazing experience at Jean George's. We had read a lot of different reviews before going and decided we wanted to take a chance on this place. We are so glad because we were so happy with our Friday night dinner.   What made our experience so great was our server James who was soooo knowledgeable and down to earth. He really gave us great recommendations not based on popularity or expensive cuts, but rather on his vast knowledge in quality, construction, and personal experience with the dishes. If you are planning on going here, we highly recommended having him as your server.  Bread loaf: so good we had to force ourselves to limit our intake for fear of getting full before our entree.   Wagyu carpaccio- amazing!!!! So inventive and robust with different tastes and textures that compliment each other in every bite. The restaurants split this into two dishes for the two of us which was so thoughtful as it made it easier to share.   Bone in Rib Eye: 4/5: medium rare, good steak though not really anything too special but what makes it so different are the sauces that comes with the steaks. (First initial thought was why sauces (are the steaks not that good)? But the sauces are so amazing and it gives a different flavor to every bite.   Prime Filet: 5/5 medium rare (our server said there's not that big of a difference between the wagyu and prime filet so we didn't go with the wagyu filet). The prime filet did not disappoint. It was \"melt in your mouth\" steak and cooked perfectly. Again, the sauces made every bite so delicious and different.   Black Truffle Mac n cheese: 5/5 holy cow was this good! It had white truffle oil and black truffle shavings on top along with chunks of bread crumbs. This may sound heavy but it was a light Mac n cheese.. such a stand out dish that was an excellent side dish to the steaks. We're so glad we went with this instead of the lobster mashed potatoes though it was a tough decision because the server said they were both great!  This dinner was not cheap and with the help of our server, we felt we ordered smart, and as a result this place left a lasting impression on us without feeling like we broke the bank. Super thanks to our server James who elevated our experience here to superb. He gave us amazing descriptions of the items on the menu and steered us in a great direction based on our preferences. He let us know which items he thought could be viewed as \"hyped\".  Without our server, we probably would've given this place 4 stars. Key takeaways: have James as your server and order smart!",

    "text": "Located in the Aria Hotel Casino -BUST!! Very disappointing dining experience at Jean Georges Steakhouse. Billed as a \"top\" Vegas steak joint - the food, food presentation and service left a lot to be desired. I'm from Chicago - I regularly eat at places like Gibson's, Ruth Chris, Morton's and RPM. My point, Jean Georges Steakhouse wouldn't survive their first year building lease in Chicago. I ordered Bone-in ribeye ($70+), shrimp cocktail ($26) and a wedge salad ($18).  The cut of steak was less than 1/2 thick with virtually no taste at all. Thankfully they offered four complimentary steak sauce toppers. The shrimp cocktail featured medium size prongs thrown in a bowl over ice. The salad like everything else was weak - small portion, stingy amount of blue cheese dressing with 2 full pieces of bacon thrown on top. Making matters worse, the service matched the food - left a lot to be desired. Here it comes...hands down the worst \"Vegas\" dinner I've had in all my years coming to town. So bad, I felt it was my duty to leave this less than stellar review. If you've got money to burn and you're planning on dumping your date or asking wife for divorce than by all means eat at Jean Georges.  You've been warned.",

    "text": "Welcome to the best meal I've ever had!  We were warmly greeted by the hostess and brought to our table at the back of the recently renovated room (No more cow noses on the walls). The decor is warm and inviting but for us, the tables were a bit too close. The conversation next to us completely dominated anything we tried to say to each other... and I may reference those diners during this review just for comedic value.  Our party of two was celebrating a birthday and the staff absolutely pampered us! Two glasses of Prosecco were brought out, much to my surprise and delight!  An Amuse Bouche of Truffle Fritter was brought to us and it was beyond delicious. (see photo) Just one bite but it prepared me for the feast yet to be delivered.  Another Amuse Bouche soon followed. A smaller version of their Tomato Salad- with avocado, hearts of palm and Coconut Vinaigrette. Very flavorful! (see photo)  Bread was brought to us on a wood block. Warm, fluffy, a bit sweet, a bit salty on top and 100% addictive. If the bread was this delicious, I couldn't wait for the main courses!  And then the table of 4 conventioneers sat next to us, loudly bragging about their expense account. Well, so much for our quiet, intimate dinner.  But there was no way I would let others ruin our evening...  We ordered a 18oz prime bone-in dry-aged ribeye and 12oz prime New York strip and sides of the crispy potatoes.   The steaks arrived cooked to perfection (medium rare) and with side sauces- House Steak, Miso Soy, Habanero, Scotch Bonnet Butter and Bearnaise. I tried each one, loving the experience and how each sauce added something different to the meat itself.  Meanwhile, on my left, the table of four ordered 4 portions of the 3oz Kobe, once again loudly boasting of how \"it wasn't them paying for it.\"  Our crispy potatoes were served in a small, cast iron pan with Chili Yogurt, Jalapenos and Dill. Yum!  This was truly more than just a meal, this was an entire experience!  And then the Kobe steaks arrived next to us. The fella to my left got up to go somewhere, leaving that tender little Kobe sitting all alone on its plate. The girl across immediately picked up her little vessel of green sauce and DUMPED IT all over her Kobe, earning an audible gasp from me. Seriously??? Okay, not fair of me to judge but why would one cover Kobe completely in sauce before they even tasted it? Oh, that's right... they weren't paying for it.  The one 3oz Kobe continued to sit neglected. I finally offered to reach over and snatch it off the plate and pop it in my mouth if someone didn't tend to it soon... I think they heard me, they finally began to settle down a bit.  Back to us- I truly savored each bite of my strip, letting each piece melt in my mouth. Just so perfect! My husband enjoyed his ribeye but also said he would try a different cut next time we dined there.   We shared one warm Valrhona chocolate cake with in-house made vanilla ice cream for dessert.   With full, happy tummies we enjoyed the rest of our evening together, giving full credit to the staff for starting our night with an amazing meal and amazing experience.  As for the conventioneers, I hope they appreciated all the work that went into their meal. I know we sure did with ours!  PS- probably not necessary to include comments about other diners in my review but it was part of our evening so there you have it.",

They guided us through the menu, giving us recommendations that were all hits with our table.   This brings me to the food. OH MY GOD. My table all said that is was probably the best meal they've ever had. It was undoubtedly the best steakhouse meal I've had. The Wagyu carpaccio is probably the best single bite I've had in recent memory. The steaks were cooked to perfection, and the crab legs were the best I've ever had- they don't skimp in size with those! The wine selection is also fantastic, with options for people at every budget. I have my sommelier certification, so sifting through the wine selection was fun in itself.   A birthday dessert was brought out for my boyfriend to top off an incredibly experience. Can't recommend this steakhouse enough.",

I've never seen crab legs that large. We then had a preset meal and I went with the tomato salad, wagu filet with a herby, delicious sauce, and chocolate dessert. We had a few side dishes that were not super memorable to be honest.  The service left something to be desired given how long the food took. I think our meal took nearly 3 hours so at least they kept our wine glasses filled up! The weirdest thing was when they took the towers before we finished. Don't rush me when I'm eating lobster!  But overall, it's a great spot in the Aria for a fancy meal.",

    "text": "Kai R.'s review is total bullshit.  Outback is better.  I don't review much but this place is such a joke of a steakhouse. I had warn those who seek the joys of beef.  I was not thrilled to go, but friends wanted too.  All you need to do is look at a few of the pictures with those criss cross grill marks and if that looks appetizing to you, save your money and hit Sizzler.    I ordered the dry-aged Kansas City for $82.  I'm pretty sure it was dry-aged on Fremont street.  I also need to see my dentist since I wore down all of my teeth trying to chew it.  It had a few char marks.  I didn't get any fancy criss cross.  No sear.  No juice leaking out on the cut.  I would have sent it back but I don't like to be the whiny idiot amongst friends.  So I choked it down.  If this was a prime dry-aged steak then I'm going to become a vegetarian.    On to the sides.  Just unimaginative.  Most that know steakhouses don't go for the sides.  Generally onion rings or some potatoes of some sort will do the trick with a good shrimp cocktail to start.  The mushrooms were standard.  The french fries....I swear they were frozen out of a bag.  No way were they twice fried and they over salted to hide the crappiness.  Truffle Mac was good.  But the truffle craze is over.  What's so sad is this joint is an example of Las Vegas trying to pay for all these amazing new hotels.  It used to be that service and experience was the utmost goal of the Casino owners.  Now it's how can we just take your money by sending you to a steakhouse that would last 3 days in Dallas, NYC or Chicago.    If you are a carnivore lover and you know your best steaks come out of a 1800+ degree broiler or on the cast iron avoid this scam.    I gave 1 star for the excellent service of such overpriced former racehorse meat.",

Got the bone in ribeye and NY strip, nothing extraordinary at all. The steak tasted pretty blend by itself. However, they do give you 5 special house sauces to dip the steak in which makes it better.  I am a steak lover so def not use to dipping my steak in sauces for taste.  Sides we got the truffle Mac n cheese, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and truffle mash potato. They're all just decently good, nothing that makes you go wow.",

Now the service--mine was 5 Star.  And here is what happened to the table next to me:  The lady complained to the server about the temp of her filet.  No questions asked.  The server took complete responsibility and removed the dish.  The manager, a relatively short time later, graciously apologized, presented her with a new steak, brought her New fresh sides, and made sure to stay as she cut into the steak and signaled perfection.

We ordered 6 of them and 4 were cooked improperly, ordered med-rare and were borderline well and after they were dropped off, by not either of our servers, the staff went MIA so basically trudged through our steaks as we did not want them to get cold. We finally brought it to their attention but at that point we were 75 min into our dining experience.   A $70+ steak should be cooked correctly. It was a shame because the next night we had to go somewhere else to make up for the poor experience at what we thought would be a high caliber meal. The saving grace was the sushi appetizer but did not make up for a disappointing $500 meal. No adjustments were made to our bill, and we were just all over it at that point.   There are better and more consistent options in Vegas as 2/6 on steaks being cooked properly is embarrassing and the steaks themselves even at burnt level were nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "This steak house is inside the Aria so yes the steaks are kinda pricey. But you are in Vegas so splurge on your steak and a few drinks :) They do have a bar located by the entrance so if you have to wait for a table grab some drinks !  Went on a Sunday night around 5pm. Didn't have a reservation but it was fairly empty so we were seated right away. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance - dim lighting to set the mood, quiet and elegant atmosphere. Perfect especially for a date night.   Ordered: A glass of Pinot Tuna tartare  Jumbo Shrimp cocktail 18oz bone in rib eye  6oz wagyu filet mignon  Lobster Mash potatoes Black Truffle Mac&Cheese   Must try :  Medium rare bone in rib eye, wagyu filet, Black truffle Mac & Cheese and Lobster Mash potatoes   They give you a variety of complimentary bread. For starters we had Tuna tartare and jumbo shrimp cocktail. The tuna tartare was pretty good and flavorful. It comes with a big piece of rice chip. Reminds me of the shrimp chips at the asian markets. Our medium rare steaks were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. They were also very juicy and tender. They give you 4 sauces to pair with your steak. Omg the wagyu filet was very tasty and tender !! Very well executed! Perfect with a glass of wine ! The steaks do not come with sides. The sides are enough to be shared among 2-3 people. For sides we ordered Lobster Mash potatoes and Black Truffle Mac & Cheese. The lobster mash potatoes kinda looks like baby food but don't let that stop you from this yummy dish. Very rich lobster flavor and a good amount of lobster bits. The Black truffle Mac & cheese was very tasty one of the best I've had!  Overall I had an amazing experience here. I liked the atmosphere. The food was soo good. The service was good as well. Our waiter explained everything in detail and was helpful with recommendations and always checked up on us. It's nice that the manager graciously came by to check up on our table. I'll definitely be back and I would like to try the crab cake, wagyu carpaccio, Tomahawk and these cocktails everyone raves about.",

She didn't ask us if we wanted a wine menu, or if we perfect bottle or tap water. When she finally come back 10min later to take our order. I had to ask for a wine menu! She had a sour look the whole time. I had to ask for the check even though she walk right passed us 5times without even coming to our table. When we did receive the bill my mother informed her she was paying, the girl ignored my mother and handed me the bill. For a $400 meal I honestly don't understand how someone can not be respectful. Have you ever heard the saying \"don't judge a book by its cover\" We honestly wanted to walk out and give $0 for a tip because that's what she deserved. Really sad on her part she could have got a $100 tip if she had any ounce of common decency.  Presentation of the food is beautiful! I had the rack of lamb which was good not great, my husband had the short ribs which he said reminded him of the taste of meatloaf. So try if you like to waste money and have HORRIBLE SERVICE",

Second time around I thought it was great, service on point, great wine selection, sommelier approached the table to see if we needed any help ordering wine but never pushed anything to us which is always appreciated.  Order caesar salad, it was ok, a little limey. Foie Gras \"pastrami\" out of this world, unfortunately I had to share with my boyfriend because I wanted it just for myself! I, of course ordered the bone marrow, which comes on this huge \"out of the flinstones\" bone - cool presentation, I enjoyed every bite and took the bone home for my dog, which he really appreciated! lol For entree we shared the filet oscar style, standard filet, really good, nothing memorable. Ordered brussels sprouts for a side, my boyfriend loved them - I didn't care for them - should have ordered the Mac N Cheese instead.  Solid 4 stars and will definitely come back and have a pastrami foie gras all on my own.",

As per the reviews, the restaurant decor and ambience was great and because it's expo week the place was filled with people.   There are a lot of steak places in Vegas and I've visited a couple. Like I said I was apprehensive based on all the reviews but for a steakhouse it really just boils down to the steak for me.   I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye and it was done to my preferred medium rare perfectly. Great cut and texture with good marbling. I think the spiced up butter served with the steak was pretty good and they've alone provided an array of sauces for you to try. I'd stick to the butter as everything else seems to over power the meat.   Ordered the Lobster Mash Potato and the Truffle Mac&Cheese as sides. To be honest they're ok, if I could reorder I think I'd stick an honest baked potato or hand cut fries. Lobster Mash was a touch salty for me and the truffle Mac and cheese was basically what the name describes. I love truffles and this Mac and cheese has the flavor but there's nothing else that truly wows.   Wine list is very comprehensive although I stuck to cocktails all night.   All in all a pretty good steak house in a nice environment.",

I was rather disappointed at this fact, because this was supposed to be a special night for my girlfriend.   Also, my steak was the 18oz Ribeye. It wasn't the best steak, have definitely had better (at Carnevino, Delmonicos, and Saltgrass). It was about 50% not edible because of all the fat. And very bland too.  My girlfriend had the filet mignon. She said it was tasty and prepared to her liking.   I just had hoped that the dinner would have been a little more memorable for my girlfriend.",

Came before the Cirque show for a 3 course dinner.  As one walks in, it is almost like dining in those underground cave taverns of Europe. A room divider is comprised entirely of hundreds of encased wine bottles on display. The chef's table private room is expansive.  My warm spinach salad with lardons and chevre vinaigrette was tasty. So was the stellar bread basket. No exaggeration: the croustillante and moelleux from their baguette made me devour another basket of just that variety: perfect bread! Loved most the sourdough; great ratios.  Next came my  12-oz NY strip, ordered medium. Done and prepped with a SW inspired dry rub, complemented with a salsa verde concocted sauce. Almost like a chimichurri. Asked for medium...cooked perfectly. But waay tougher than I had expected.  Glasses of bubbly are reasonably priced.  The cheesecake with the sour cherry compote and cream inside of a tuille stole the entire show. A sucker for cheesecake, this plate was stunning, in presentation, form, and taste. Quite good.  My service was impeccable, save when i needed them in the end to get the bill. Other than that, attentive and quick. At times, almost too quick. Glad I have this Alsace-born Vongerichten establishment to compare Shanghai Nougatine to.",

But for as expensive as it was, service was lacking. Getting our water filled was a challenge. We were checked on one time. I ordered extra limes with my beverage, and had to ask my waitress 2 times and then finally asked a different waiter who brought them some time later.  When It came to clearing the dishes, she did so by reaching in front of you, and even leaned a little on me to grab a dish. There was no, \"excuse my reach\"... When clearing the placemat, she spilt the crumbs on the two sitting next to me.   Like I said, food was great. Which is why I'm giving 3 stars. I think everyone at the table was more than satisfied with their meal. It was very expensive, but the steak was on point. My friends enjoyed the bone marrow and scallops.",

I think we got there right when it opened because the staff all gave us attention and the sommelier even stopped and chatted and recommended a Bordeaux that was a great value just to be nice.  I hesitated to accept the recommendation, but he stated it was a personal recommendation so we took the plunge.  It turned out to be a perfect selection for our tastes.    We had such a great experience at this restaurant.  All of the food was exceptional.  We had a wedge salad, and the ribeye with a side of mushrooms and crunchy potatoes.  The only thing bad was I felt like the steak was a little thin.  Seriously, that is the only thing.  I can't take away a star for that.  I cant wait to try his other restaurant at the Bellagio!",

    "text": "One of the best meals we had during our Vegas vacation was here at Jean George Steakhouse.  Oh my goodness, I'm still thinking about it.  Everything from start to finish was just wonderful.  Here's what we had:  COCKTAIL: The Ginger Pear Made with pear vodka, orange and lemon juice, and ginger syrup It was a very interesting drink.  I love the taste of pear, and definitely want to pick up a pear vodka so I can make drinks at home.  The ginger syrup was spicy and gave the drink that addictive little kick.  APPETIZER: Dungeness Crab Crostini Made with garlic aioli, lemon and dill Perfect little start to a glorious meal.  Very generous on the crab.  It wasn't a warm dish, and it might've been even better warm.  It was tasty, but out of the whole, it was our least favorite thing.  ENTREE:  Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Tomahawk Steak (special) I asked for this medium well, which I know is not the ideal temp for a piece of meat like this.  But I prefer it, and it was cooked perfectly.  So juicy, tender and extremely flavorful.  My husband's Tomahawk steak was a wagyu hybrid, and his was cooked perfectly as well.  Both steaks came with four sauce selections: soy-miso butter, homemade steak sauce, bearnaise, and a super hot (too hot for me) sauce.  Our favorite was the soy-miso butter.  SIDE:  Roasted Brussel Sprouts Topped with avocado and pecan I love roasted brussel sprouts.  This was a very interesting take with the addition of the avocado.  I probably could have done without it, unless you just like bites with several textures.  The brussel sprouts themselves were charred nicely and had good flavor.  SIDE: Broiled Bone Marrow Served with a side of parsley lemon gremolata and toast points The creepiest, most carniverous thing they could sit at the table ended up being one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Who knew?  Putting the marrow on toast and topping it with a bit of the gremolata was just an amazing bite.  The richest most intense beef flavor you can imagine.  I would eat this again in a heartbeat.  DESSERT: Salted Caramel Sundae Vanilla ice cream topped with fudge sauce, candied peanuts and popcorn This was a cute little dessert, but nothing spectacular about it.  We enjoyed it, it was satisfying, but it certainly wasn't a culinary wonder.  I will say their dessert menu didn't really have anything that interesting on it beside your staple cheesecake, chocolate cake, and apple crisp.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just an FYI.  Our server was excellent.  Was extremely knowlegable, friendly, and expeditious.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience at Jean Georges.  I would recommend this restaurant with two very enthusiastic thumbs up.",

As a foodie, I never felt I could \"have so much fun\" by all surprisingly great selections of food and amazingly friendly service! Excellent!!   Food- Many choices, creative and beautiful presentations, great quality! Unique display of Tuna Tartare with a big piece of deep fried wavy rice paper- good! Waygu beef capaccio wrapped over crunchy (potato balls?) with truffle oil, topped with basil leafs & dash of some crunchy ingredient on top- must try! Excellent steak & lobster, love the sea bass with yozu mushroom!   Drinks - I had the Ginger Pear cocktail! Very different & unique. Never tasted such before. I requested a lighter touch of the ginger taste, very refreshing and light sweet! I don't like over sweet, so it was perfect! Wine of coz is excellent!  Dessert- we were so full, but still! Killed the chocolate lava cake (it's so different- the best I had!- just got told by the manager Jean Philip is actually the \"inventer\"!!!) & their special Churro tossed w/ caramelized bananas & vanilla icecream & peanuts!   Service- beyond excellent! For me, service is the \"most\" important quality as fulfilling customers' satisfaction. Food servers explained politely & warmly in details of plates, ingredient, purposes of different sauces that come w/ the steak. Love the manager Jack who gave great history and background of the restaurant! We customers do love food and do love to know more about the restaurant. They have other concept restaurants in other states & countries like in Trump Tower in NYC, England, and upcoming in Japan! I'm curious now!  Atmosphere- love it! Soft lounge music background, not super causal, but not over formal, perfect for dating, business, and friends gathering! Impressive million dollar wine wall!   Everything was so good! Beyond words! Fun! Loved the service!!   Highlights: Waygu Beef Capaccio, Tuna Tartare, Ginger Pear Cocktail, Sea Bass, desserts - must try Jean Philip's invention- lava cake, special churro with banana and icecream.   Thank you manager Jack and food servers (I only remember Eddie and the other lady, sorry for forgetting the name) for such amazingly fun night!   Never write so long! Ha!",

Honestly, the chefs on Disney's Fantasy do an exceptionally better job. My dinner partner ordered the filet mignon. Out of the five sauces that accompanied it, only one was worth the taste. The complicated dishes were meant to impress, yet fell short by covering up the natural goodness of the sea bass and the filet mignon. Our sides, mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach, were acceptable. We will not return or offer a recommendation. I am giving the review two stars because the servers were excellent.",

    "text": "For a $$$$ restaurant we were disappointed. Having frequented many nice steakhouses in Las Vegas and Los Angeles this by far was the worst we have encountered. From the beginning we were not presented menus or greeted for 5 minutes. The portion sizes for sides was very small for price whereas other places are family style for that cost. Lastly, my filet was not as tender as I expected. Filets should melt in your mouth and be easy to cut with a knife. This restaurant is not worth the hype. Many other restaurants are worth going to in Vegas. Do not recommend",

The big bone in it and sauce tray on side will try to convince you its better.  Ambiance: 4/5  Price: 2/5  No one should have to pay $12 for a small portion of mash potatoes.   Advice: Unless your wallet is endless, try somewhere else. And if your wallet is endless, try somewhere else bc Im sure for that price theres much better out there.",

We arrived 40 minutes early from our reservation at 9 and we were offered to be seated.  We grabbed a seat at the bar instead.  Our bartender whipped up perfect cocktails and we enjoyed the atmosphere and a couple chats. The atmosphere is dim, romantic, and the art compliments the restaurant.  We asked our server what it was of and if you get a chance to check it out, it's the skeleton of an ox's nose painting (we were trying to figure it out the whole night.) We notified the hostess we were ready and were promptly seated. We started our evening with appetizers.  I had a choice of fried calamari which was cooked to perfection and came out HOT (a pet peeve when tempura comes out cold) with a mayo based sauce to accompany it which was absolutely fantastic, The boyfriend had foie gras and everything on the dish complimented one another.  For entrees I went with the chefs special lobster tail was nice but I might've opted for a different dish. The boy ordered soy glazed ribs which was melt in the mouth (licking the plate clean delicious lol!) From checking in to leaving the restaurant we were treated with the best service and our Sommelier Jason had everything to the T as well as our server!  Best wine pairings for each dish.  One of the most memorable nights/dinners I've had. We left the restaurant with full stomachs and slightly intoxicated (very happy customers!) being greeted out by the same bartender who served us almost 2-3 hours ago.",

    "text": "I went here looking for something simple. I wanted a small meal but wanted some fries and some quality beef. I sat at the bar and I ordered the ginger pear cocktail...very refreshing but very tart that it gave me heartburn. I love vodka and ginger.  Next cocktail moscow mule...hmmm they used a ginger syrup instead of ginger beer. Hollerrrr!!! Love love love!! Great service at the  bar....they weren't very busy at the bar but the rest of the restaurant seemed a bit full. I decided to go with the burger with brie and fries and a side of mayo.  I decided not to go with the filet because I thought it would be too much food. So I think the burger was $25 or $26 and it came with truffle fries and some kind of truffle mayo I believe and the burger had brie and yuzu pickles on it. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare. They brought my side of mayo and had gone to the restaurant next door to get it which I thought was nice. The fries came in a small black iron dish with truffles on top...not impressed. I ate around them. I just wanted fries...normal fries. These fries were short and small. I could barely dip them in my mayo and ketchup....ugghhh.  The burger....I am a huge fan of pickles...nice kosher pickles...maybe a little spice to them. These were awful. Didn't taste anything like a pickle. The brie...I love brie...love love love brie, but not on this burger. The meat was dry. I think it was medium rare...looked kinda medium. The place was kinda dark so I couldn't really tell.  Overall, very disappointed with my $25 burger and fries. I think I will stick to the cocktail and steak menu next time.  4 stars for excellent service and nice ambience. This is my second time here and the service is always good.",

    "text": "This is a high end steakhouse opened by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.  Let me first say, the service was great.  The waiter was very knowledgeable and  very helpful in all aspects.    For the price of the meal (this place was not cheap by any means), I was extremely disappointed.   The steaks were cooked to the requested temperature, but something was lacking in taste of the meat.  On an upside, they do provide a basil-butter sauce on the side (that was really good) and really allowed each bite to be more memorable.    Two side notes on side dishes:  1) We had to send back the cream of spinach.  We had 3 orders and all the orders were excessively salty, to the point it was unbearable. They had no problem remaking the cream of spinach, but when it came back it seemed like the cream of spinach was slightly running/watery. Did they remake it or just dilute it out????  2)  The single highlight of this restaurant was the side order of the truffle balls (don't know what it was exactly called).  It was ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN beyond delicious.  Maybe the flaws were because it was a newer restaurant that just opened.  Hopefully they will get it right soon as the location and feel of the restaurant were in-line with a high end steakhouse.",

I'm being generous with one star,  but the restaurant is lovely, the wine list is exciting (if not pompous and overpriced),  the mozzarella on the tomato\\mozzarella\\balsamic appetizer   was exquisitely fresh, the wait staff was attentive (albeit arrogant and dishonest)  and the strip steak from one of our group was supposedly delicious - - But that's all the good I can say.  We visitied JGS last night. We sensed we should have left after my wife ordered a vodka gimlet- which was merely some chilled vodka with a piece of lime placed in it.  When the waiter told us that he had watched the bartender squeeze an entire lime into the drink, he had no explanation as to why the vodka was clear and not bearing the cloudy remnants of having had all of that fresh lime squeezed into it or any evidence of any lime juice  Oh well-  that's just the drink.  But the meal went downhill from there. Three of us in the party order lobster tails, which were all rubbery (at least they were consistent).  My veal chop (ordered medium), was undercooked and fatty (and inedible).  Having taken only 2 bites out of it,   I told one of the wait staff that I couldn't eat it and they neither offered to replace it or take it off the bill.  They even screwed up a side of spinach, as it was overly salty and also inedible.  In short - if you have limited time in Vegas and want to enjoy a fine, upscale dining experience- --  then go someplace else.",

Also the sides are priced too high for the portion or quality ($10-$16). Finally the salad or soup is also priced beyond what other comparable restaurants charge, $18 for a side Caeser. I recommend Strip Steak, N9ne or Capital Grille over this place.",

Service and wine selection were very good, but the food was nothing special.  My medium rare filet came out medium.  The bone marrow (usually a favorite dish) was disappointing - it was gelatinous and didn't have that spreadable, butter-like quality you would expect.  Lobster mashed potatoes and truffle mac were enjoyable, but not earth shattering (pretty much anything with lobster and/or truffle is going to taste good).  I did like that the creamed spinach was not too heavy, and that you could see the stems on the spinach leaves, indicating they used fresh spinach.  One final complaint - they wouldn't split the bill on more than (I think) 4 credit cards, which was kind of a pain with that large a group (10 ppl) (one would think they'd be more accommodating given the number of bachelor/bachelorette parties and guys/girls' weekends that are likely to be there).  All told, not worth the money, but really, is anything you eat or drink at a big Vegas hotel going to be?",

    "text": "LOOONG overdue review as the last time I was there was in August.    It was a last minute idea for our group of 4 to go and have some steaks before a night of hard partying.    A friend and I decided to share the Tuna Tartare to start.  I have never tasted something so delcious!  The ingredients were combined beautifully and we devoured every last morsel.  The tartare was served with an asian prawn cracker (they call it puffed rice cracker)  and probably should've came with 2 crackers to even out the tuna to cracker ratio.    The 3 of us opted for the 8oz Filet Mignon and our friend ordered the 18 Oz. Ribeye.  Let me tell you, I usually do not order the filet mignon but this one was to DIE for.  The meat was sooo tender and incredibly juicy.  I looooved the sauce that accompanied it (some green mint sauce).  The steaks were also served with a three pepper marmalade, soy-miso butter, bernaise, and a JG steak sauce.  I tried all sauces (I'm a saucy girl), but found myself to go back to that mysterious green sauce.    For sides, we shared the black truffle & comte fritter, which was kinda like a lil jalapeno popper...but klassier, roasted royal trumpet mushrooms, and good ol' mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  All equally delicious, but the main star of the night were the steaks.    My friend who ordered the 16 oz. ribeye took his leftovers home and we microwaved it and ate it the next morning.  It still tasted delish!    We ended the night with coffee, tea and shared the warm chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was warm and gooey in the center..kinda like a lava cake with yummy vanilla bean ice cream on the side.    Getting a 3 of a kind in 3 card poker = FREE DELICIOUS MEAL FOR ALL :)",

Food was pretty good but nothing amazing..  Service was terrible.  It took over an hour to get our entrees.  That's absolutely ridiculous.  Even with appetizers.  Dining room wasn't even busy since it was so late at night.  We had two waiters.  One was very friendly.  The other was slightly condescending and rude.  Burrata Mozzarella Salad - Very good.  Can't go wrong with Burrata.  Roasted Chilean Sea Bass - Was just ok.  I wasn't a big fan of the Miso glaze but then again I don't really like any Miso marinades.  Rack of Lamb - Delicious and perfectly cooked, seasoned.    Creamed Spinach - too salty.  Broiled Bone Marrow - good but could have been better.  A little bit bland.    Creamed Corn - very good.

Quality and presentation is great and taste is wonderful as well.   Their wine & champagne options are definitely worth it. Had their 2005 Dom Perignon, 2 dessert wines (08 Royal Tokaji & 74 Porto Kopke Colheita) amazing experience on the palates.  Arnold B was our somm and waiter for the night and he was great to talk to and a very friendly, knowledgable gentleman. Also ask for their chocolate brownie served tableside if you're feeling dessert-y it was definitely an experience!",

I love everything about this restaurant, from a sexy decor, to great service, to food that makes my taste buds oh so happy! It is quite pricie, but worth every penny. Dinner for 4 included: 4 tomahawk steaks, 2 lobster mash potatoes, foie gras, grilled bone marrow, calamari, and 4 drinks for a grand total of $630 plus tip. The Tomahawk steak isn't on a menu, so you have to ask for it. If there are 4 or more people in your party that will order that particular steak, call ahead of time and make sure they will have it available for your dinner. Those steaks are pure perfection! This time we ordered lobster mash potatoes, but since I am not a fan of lobster, my preference goes to truffle mashed potatoes.",

It's the cool kid of steakhouses. They have a great wine display and the music rocks. The food is surprisingly fun and unique for a steak-driven menu and the service was fantastic.  Our feast included: Tuna Tartare and Rosemary Breadcrumb Crusted Yellowfin Tuna Crispy Skin Chicken w/ Lemon Butter Miso-Yuzu Glazed Chilean Sea Bass Braised Short Rib wi/ Jalepeno Apple Puree Prime NY Steak w/ Chimichurri  Black Truffle and Comte Cheese Fritter Broiled Bone Marrow w/ Parsley-Lemon Gremolata Warm Chocolate Cake w/ Vanilla Ice Cream  I felt like I ate the entire universe, but the highlights for me were the tuna, NY steak, fritters and bone marrow.  I think I may have grunted a few times as I ate. Thankfully the music is on the louder side.  I left feeling like a cow... and not a hot one either.  Definitely worth visiting if you appreciate cattle as much as I do.",

Since it was wagyu it's to be expected, but seriously that meat damn near melted in my mouth.    The other items we sampled were the oysters, iceberge wedge salad, and lobster mashed potatoes. These were not very notable, in my opinion. The lobster mash had only a few small pieces of lobster, and was whipped potatoes with I think cheddar... It ended up tasting a bit like cheese whiz. My date's order of dry aged NY strip was a little less impressive than my steak...  But that wagyu filet though... I was one very happy girl.  The service was also very friendly and extremely attentive.  The experience was not bad at all.",

It might be the best I've had.  We both had the dry-aged 10 oz New York Strip. Phenomenal. Amazing flavor and it cut like butter. Really quite wonderful.

    "text": "Second stop in a foodie crawl through Aria/Crystals.  When we first walked in, I was a little apprehensive.  The bartender seemed confused as to why we were there, asking if we were waiting for a table (the place was empty).  When we told him we just wanted drinks and snacks, he didn't say anything but just handed us a cocktail menu and food menu.  I ordered my drink, a ginger margarita, and the bartender ran off to make it without asking my husband what he wanted, which was odd.  But then he delivered the drink and took my husband's drink order.  Different kind of system I guess.  I grabbed the free popcorn at the bar and started chowing down.  Nothing was getting me down today.  My ginger margarita ($14) was excellent - to the point where I had to hold myself back from chugging it.  My husband's lychee bellini ($14) looked pretty but I didn't try it.  He enjoyed it.  By the way, the coasters are apparently supposed to depict a cow.  I had to stare at it a while to see it.  Look at my pics, imagine some eyes, and you'll see it.  The design is all over the restaurant.  At first I thought it was supposed to depict a fork on LSD.  We decided to order the steak tartare ($20), which interestingly enough comes with basil (not parsley), quail egg, and lime juice.  Extremely yummy! It comes with the best french fries ever!   We also got the truffle fritters ($12) and, OMG, these were the best!  Just the right about of truffle, nice and cheesy inside.  So good.  And the right portion size at 8 fritters.  Even though we were only ordering appetizers and drinks, the bartender brought by bread.  We got pretzel bread and cherry pecan.  The bread was really, really good.  I love pretzel bread and he gave us three pieces.  I almost ate too much, which would have ruined me for the next two restaurants in the foodie crawl so I limited myself to one piece.  The bartender was super friendly - I think he was just feeling us out in the beginning.  He started chatting us up and we got some info from him on why so many restaurants were closed in Aria that night (American Fish, Bar Masa, Sirio, Sage) with NFR and the marathon in town.  He said that Aria is an occupancy based property and they were only at 30% occupancy so when that happens some of the restaurants close to keep costs down.  People don't really walk in off the street.  Bummer.  Towards the end of the meal, some guy who was getting comped sat down next to us and was being a real prick.  So that probably explains why the bartender was standoffish at the beginning.  This was my favorite restaurant of the foodie crawl.  A nice surprise!",

It was phenomenal one of the best steak I've ever had and was around $68. We ordered calamari for appetizers which came with a ciracha foam sauce. Amazing. I believe was $20. My friend had ordered the short ribs which was really good a little sweet but the meet came right off. My waitress was super nice and was kind to offer some specials and her opinions on what I would like. As it was a late birthday celebration she in the end brought a molten chocolate cake with French vanilla ice cream and let me tell you the cake was cooked to perfection the chocolate oozed out. I do not know the price as it was complimentary. Everything was great I highly suggest to order the steak and desert as it is worth every penny.

    "text": "We held our Company dinners every year at this restaurant, for at least three years in a row. First time (when Aria just opened), our Cosmo concierge sent us there (and it was the only place that could accommodate our group on a short notice). Our first experience was great.  This year, what a different story! Let me start with the positives: decor still seems relevant, the meat is still good (though not amazing). Crab (though the tiniest of portions) tasted fresh and excellent. Tomato soup was very good.  Now the bad: the service! Water not refilled (see other reviews, all True, had to ask for it every time!). Salad and vegetable menu rather tired and uninspired. Tiniest and pricey side portions and humongous hunks of meat (even our biggest guys left at least half of their steaks on the table). My tomato salad had a loooong black hair in it (!). Disgusting.  A SEPARATE MENTION: our group consisted mostly of men, business associates, with healthy appetites. We all ordered a lot, appetizers, meats, etc. However, the waitress (a blond woman) stooped to harassment and kept pushing one of the guests, a young lady, to order something in addition to the soup she asked for. Our guest politely refused every push to order extra food, and the waitress was getting progressively more and more annoyed and showing it very clearly. She wouldn't quit pressuring the girl and almost drove her to leave. The waitress proceeded to be visibly annoyed whenever a less than the most expensive choice was made for any reason by any other guest. Only the fact that it was a company dinner and that I did not want to make a scene prevented me from contacting the management on the spot. Soon after, the waitress lost any interest in attending to our table whatsoever. She returned one more time to loudly inquire if the same young guest \"had finally changed her mind\" about getting more food (she did not). We were left to fend for ourselves and to seek help (like asking for utensils) from random busboys. No manager ever came by to check on our large group.  In short: food just OK, service a shame. We were left with the impression the restaurant couldn't care less. Spend your money elsewhere (like the superb Bazaar Meat which ended up costing us less and providing an amazing dining experience).",

    "text": "I read the reviews before coming here for a nice evening out with the boy. I was excited for some bomb ass steak and prepared for some less than stellar service.   Minus one star for the front staff. It's a 5 pm on a Friday and the place is practically empty. Attitude AND 10 minutes to be seated? Give me a break.  We skipped appetizers and went straight for entrees. I got the NY Strip and the truffle fritters. The boy got filet minion and mashed potatoes.   My boyfriend loved his filet minion. He said it was one of the top five steaks he's had in his life. For him, it was cooked to perfection. Also, I think he was more in love with his mashed potatoes than me, if only during dinner. I kid, he loves me way more than mashed potatoes! I admit, they were great: creamy and not too salty.   My 16 ounce NY strip was a behemoth. I had it cooked medium and it was a great steak, but not top 5 for me. The truffle fritters were yummy, but a bit on the strong side. Then in a stroke of genius, I combined a piece of steak and a fritter and KABOOM. Perfection. Too bad I was going into a food coma at that point and only had about 3 bites left in me.   We were also given a plate of the 4 dipping sauces and the steak come with a salsa verde. It's on the minty side, which I enjoyed. Of the 4 sauces I liked the hot sauce best (it's yellow).   No dessert. Too full.   Besides the food: we were seating along the edge of the restaurant along the wall, close to the bar...Nothing kills the mood like a blaring hockey game and bad hits from 2005. Really?  Then about 10 minutes later, another couple was seated right next to us...awkward, considering there were at least 3 tables on either side of us that were empty. However, I did note that this is how they were seating everyone. Awkward times for everyone!  Thankfully we were close to the end of our meal when a party of 4 were seated near us. They were the 55 year old versions of Jersey Shore. Loud. Obnoxious. Not even funny! At least entertain me if you are going to be that annoying.   Ending on a happy note, our waiter was the bomb! John? Jim? Jake? Jeff? Jared? Jacob?...Steve? I feel bad for not remembering but he was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, etc. The best service I've had in a while. He's what really saved the day and this rating.",

    "text": "Old and dilapidated furniture with overpriced menu.  As I walked in the restaurant with my wife and daughter, I couldn't help noticing the wear and tear on the chairs and tables of this purportedly upscale restaurant. As soon as I sat on my chair I realized the furniture was not just old looking, it was very uncomfortable as well. The peeling wood laminate on the tables was an unexpected  cheap touch that only served as warning of the pretentious ways of this establishment.  Our appetizers were beef carpaccio, foie gras, and the bone marrow, which was the main reason for us going to JG instead of Mastro's. The foie gras was burned and insipid - without a doubt the worst tasting foie gras I have had. The carpaccio was a better appetizer but the amount of meat was below what other restaurants offer at similar price and quality of dish. My wife liked the bone marrow; since it is not something I enjoy much I will not comment on its taste.  We were debating whether to leave and go to another restaurant because at this point our expectations for our entree, a tomahawk, were very low. Turns out we were right. The tomahawk completed the disappointment. We decided to pack the rest of the entree and move our dinner to Mastro's, which has become a must visit every time we are in Vegas.  Btw, when I made the reservation, I told the hostess that our visit was to celebrate my wife's birthdate. The check came and went without any mention of the special occasion.   We walked over to Mastro's  and had the escargot followed by the tomahawk, which was about $10 less than at JG. No comparison between the two restaurants. Service, comfortable seats, white new-like table cloth, beautiful decoration, and much better tasting food. We were able to compare the two tomahawks side by side. If Mastro's was a 10, JG's was a 7 at most.  When we walked in, we were asked if we were celebrating anything, I told them about the birthday occasion. After we were done with our entree and without further direction, our waiter placed Mastro's signature dessert, the butter cake, with a happy birthday dedication on the plate - there was no charge for the butter cake.  We regretted ever setting foot on JG but were happy that we left to still enjoy dinner somewhere else.   This review is not to recommend Mastro's, but to warn you about JG. There are restaurants that are worth spending $100 + per person where you will feel satisfied after your meal. JG is not one of them.   I am in no way affiliated with Mastro's or any other establishment in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We came here as part of a package deal we received with Aria.    Let's start with the service.  It was decent and somewhat attentive, but for this type of an establishment, I would have expected a little more.  There were a few times where our water glasses stayed empty for a while, but w/e.  We started with the Tuna Tartare, which was the highlight of the evening.  Just a perfect blend of shitake mushrooms, tuna, turnip, and other stuff.  I wish it was served with something other than the \"unfinished\" eggroll wrapper for crackers, but it was still delicious.  Definately a must have.  For dinner, the wife and I shared the 26 oz Tomahawk steak (granted 8oz was just the bone) and the 8oz Australian lobster.  For the sides we had the Bone Marrow and the Sauteed spinach.    The steak was really well cooked and the sauces they served with it were ok.  Of the 5 sauces, the habenero dill was my favorite.  The others weren't really worth mentioning.  The lobster is something I would steer clear of next time.  It was a little overcooked and rubbery, and the taste just didn't cut it.  The bone marrow was excellent, if you like gelatenous gooey goodness.  The parsley-lemon gremolta they serve with it was awesome, wish they gave more of it.  Spinach was so-so.  For desert, we had the warm chocolate cake.  We proabably should have just passed on this, because it wasn't very good.  Kind of like a chocolate suffle but without the deliciousness of a suffle.  Also worth mentioning was the Cherry Yuzu soda.  This was so good, but at $8 per glass, you might want to take it slow.  Overall the experience was great.  The bill ended up being ~$300 for everything, which isn't bad.  However, if I were in Vegas in the mood for steak, I would definately go to Craftsteak and have the Kobe Wagyu pre-fix.  Its about the same in price, but much better tasting food, with a greater variety.  I think if it wasn't part of the Aria package, and technically free, I would probably be more upset at dining at Jean Georges.",

Ordered a Fillet Mignon and a NY....OMG my NY was the saltiest piece of meat ever to pass my lips!!!!

    "text": "The thing about Vegas is that there are tons of great food places, so I'm always blown away by the food.  The ambiance and the service was excellent here, but the food was only okay.  I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Here are my thoughts:  Service: 4 stars We had a great waiter and I wanted to become best friends with one of the staff members.  Because we had to wait so long for some food to come out, he gave us some complimentary wedge salads.  We also got asked a bunch of trivia questions and if we got them right we got free molten lava cake desserts.  Probably because they had extras (our desserts said Congratulations! on them yet we were celebrating nothing) - but hey, a free delicious dessert is a free delicious dessert.  My one complaint was that we didn't eat THAT much food, but our meal lasted over 3 hours long.  Ambiance: 5 stars Loved the decor - confused a bit about the lit walls and what that design is (it's on the menus too).  Not too dimly lit like some restaurants.  I was happy I could still see my friends I was dining with.  Food: 3 stars We got a bunch of food.  Like a lot. + I forget what wine we got but we got a Malbec for $42 that was decent. + Oysters - excellent.  Half a dozen for $20 is about standard.  + Tuna tartare ($20) - not bad, but I've definitely had better.  - Pork belly spring rolls ($20) - not great.  The sauce was overpowering, and two tiny egg rolls essentially (fried - so not spring rolls like advertised), and the pork belly was just okay.  Not really worth my stomach filling up for. + Spinach salad ($14) - I'm in love with goat cheese (which was the dressing) and bacon - big fan + Wedge salads (free for us) - I usually dislike bleu cheese, but this dressing was mild enough for me to enjoy. - Porterhouse steak $60) - ordered it medium rare - I think the order must have messed up because it took quite some time to come out (hence the free salads maybe?).  My portion was a bit charred and underwhelming.  Not great tasting to be honest. + Chilean sea bass ($42) - small portion for the price.  Came with a bunch of sauces though and I must say the miso-butter sauce complemented this really well.  The shiitake mushrooms were roasted pretty darn good too. - Black truffle and comte fritter ($12) - underwhelming.  Cheese wasn't gooey enough and truffle taste wasn't as strong as expected.  Waiter said it comes with 7 balls - we got 8.  Score? + Bone marrow ($16) - pretty darn good.  Wish there was more. Molten lava cake (free for us) - amazing.  Rich, perfectly balanced with the homemade vanilla bean ice cream.  Some of the food was decent, but I would say I have had better and that for the price we paid, it wasn't extraordinary.  I happened to see Michael Phelps here during our meal and have talked more about that then the actual food.  Granted, he could be yummy in his own sense I suppose :D",

We made our reservation ahead of time so we were promptly seated. The hostess and manager who showed us to our seats were very friendly. I didn't care much for the decor as it was a little too avant-garde for a steakhouse. Our server greeted us immediately and told us about the specials, she recited them super fast so we didn't hear half of the things she said. I felt had she slowed her pace a little and gave us a chance to interact, she probably would've sold all of us on the specials.  We started with the Crispy Shrimp. It was tasty but very small portion to be an appetizer (only 3 shrimp); for our dinner, we ordered the New York strip, the Filet and the Rib-eye. My strip was cooked exactly the way I wanted. Meat was very tender and flavorful, I almost didn't need the miso butter sauce (which was good, a bit salty). My friends seemed to enjoyed their steak as well. We shared some lobster mash (basic mash starts at $10 and prices go up for different kinds of mash - garlic, lobster, etc etc), which was actually the highlight of the meal for me; creamed spinach and grilled Asparagus.  Overall, our food was tasty and our service was great. However, for a five star Vegas establishment I felt the experience was nothing special. I would still recommend this place for people looking for a great steak.",

We were starved and quickly made up our mind. However, we had a smartass of a waiter who decided to lag it for 30 minutes before we ordered. While he was listing off the specials he gave everyone really weird eye contact, actually he did that throughout the night.   I ordered the Australian F1 Tomahawk Bone in Rib eye, which the waiter said was a wagyu and prime crossbreed. It was a special that day at $95. I got the bone marrow side and foie grais appetizer. My lady got 8 or 10 oz filet with black truffle fritter as a side. My buddies got a 28oz porterhouse, and the miso seabass. I forgot what else they ordered. But from what I remember, the miso seabass was overly saucey.  Anyways... My steak came horribly charred on the outside. Every bite was like sinking my teeth into a piece of charcoal. The waiter came by and asked if he could do anything about the steak. All i was thinking was \"what are you gona shave off all the charcoal on the outside?\" I said forget it and just dealt with it. It was all getting comped by Aria anyways. All the sides were good though. The foie had a great apple jalapeno spread on the side.   Overall the food was decent. I liked craftsteak better (plus they serve real kobe). The ambiance was nice. Trendy little cowfaces everywhere. I would say our waiter ruined my experience though. He was just really awkward and a smartass. Later on when we asked for boxes, another waitress was so kind and even offered to put extra bread in there for us.",

Wow. the bone marrow with the toast was simply delightful. Simply eating a piece of toast with a layer of fat is amazing. The steak tar tare was served with fries. It was savory, and refreshing to the palate. The same goes for the tuna tar tare.   Main dish was NY strip steak, lamb chops, and lobster. Everything was either seared or broiled to perfection. It was literally the best NY strip steak that I've ever had.   Topped of the night with the chocolate cake, and espresso.   You will have a great time!   Definitely go and check it out!",

We started with a bottle of red...good thing is they have a decent and diverse wine list, hitting all price points.  Even the cheap wines are \"OK\"; the bad thing is most are marked up about 225%.  We ordered 3 appetizers (crab cake, pork belly egg rolls, and bone marrow side dish as an app).  I was bummed to find out they took foie gras off the menu, due to its unpopularity.  On a promising note, the waiter and sommelier were attentive and the waiter did double check to see if there just happened to be any foie gras  \"available\" in the kitchen; sadly there was not.  Appetizers filled the 3 of us, but our entrees included sea bass, tomahawk steak special, and a burrata tomato salad and tuna tartare salad.  Sea bass was the best out of the three.  There seem to be too little salt on the steak, tomatoes, and tuna, but all were still decent but not out of this world or matching the price tag.  We ordered a second bottle to numb the damage just prior to the check.  Ouch it hurts, especially since  I've had better \"expensive\" food.  I walk away with a memory of \"eating there\" sort of a tick mark on a bucket list, but nothing particularly stands out from my dining experience.

    "text": "We went at Jean georges for our 1st anniversary on Saturday evening after the show... This is the 3rd time we go to the Jean Georges and we have never been disapointed! This is still a mysterious question for me: \"where do they buy their meat?!\"... The ribeye is so tender, so juicy, so tasty! I have been disapointed by the french fries this time... They advertise hand cut, but this is clearly not hand cut... Or hand cut from the freezer. And the price is in the high range for a steakhouse... I would rate 3.5 stars if I could... I recommend anyway this restaurant for a good intimate and romantic dinner.",

    "text": "Much like Aria itself, Jean Georges Steakhouse had very modern and interesting decor. From the moment you walk in you notice the muted colors and glowing walls. We had made a reservation and were seated promptly. (Some reviews mentioned don't even bother walking in without one!) The service was generally good and helpful. We ordered the JG burger and ribeye steak along with a bottle of wine, black truffle comte fritters and lobster mash potatoes. Overall, this was a very good burger but it lacked the \"wow\" I was expecting given the price and the fame of the chef. It was prepared just as I requested and arrived nice and neatly presented. The meat was flavorful, juicy and glowed with that wonderful medium rare pinkness. The bun was nice and fresh, but perhaps fewer sesame seeds could be better (there were a lot!). The burger came with delicious fries and for once I didn't even have to ask for ketchup! In short, the burger was quite satisfying, definitely one of the better ones I had, but once again, it didn't quite amaze me which I had hoped for. Even so, paired with wine and the other sides we ordered, the burger made a very good dinner. The ribeye was similar, well prepared, delicious and savory but short of amazing. The sides were perhaps the best part of the meal and the most savory. The restaurant certainly lives up to its $$$$ rating so be prepared to spend. Having dined at Jean George's other restaurants in NYC, this is a good place but not excellent and does not quite match the level of his other establishments.",
