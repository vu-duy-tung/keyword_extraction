If saltiness of this dish was perfect, it could be the best dish of the day. Signature tomato home made spaghetti , fresh pasta was great but again the tomato sauce was heavy because of butter I guess.  If you're looking for authentic Italian, this is not a place to go.",

Based on the yelp reviews, and the fact that they are in the posh Cosmo, we were able to make a last minute reservations.      The uber contemporary interior was very inviting while giving some great views of the strip and the bellagio fountains. The star of this dinner was by far the spaghetti. The absolute best cooked pasta I have ever had.  The best. House made pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. It actually had that slight \"crunch\" a perfect pasta should have, but raaaaarely does. All the other pastas were fantastic as well.  Scarpetta is a perfect combination of style and execution. I would say a must try.",

I could begin by talking about how delicious their appetizers and main courses are but I would rather talk about their desserts.   OMG. Their desserts are to die for. Their strawberry souffle is out of this world. It was light and fluffy as souffles should be but not too sweet. Melts in your mouth the second it touches your tongue. Light and slightly sweet...thinking about brings me joy. The vanilla ice cream adds to how amazing devouring this warm delicious souffle was.   We also had the coconut panacotta with guava...silky smooth and just so so good !! The Amaedi Chocolate Cake is what every chocolate lover craves when they think of dessert. Warm melted chocolate in every bite with ice cream on the side *-*   Please prepare yourself and do not over eat during dinner. You do not want to skip dessert!!",

The complimentary bread basket was phenomenal. My favorite was the focaccia with prosciutto.  Bread came with three different spreads: whipped butter mascarpone, eggplant caponata and a lemon infused olive oil.  Thy were all delicious but I especially enjoyed the eggplant caponata.  I ordered the Wagyu beef tartare as my appetizer. The beef wasn't as red as I would've liked it to be. It looked brown but I couldn't tell if it was from the bad lighting of the restaurant. The dish had no flavor and I basically had to force myself to eat it.  I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli with a marsala reduction for my entree. I like that they make their own fresh pasta but the dish lacked the debt of flavor you'd expect from the components of this dish. It was like waiting for a climax that never came.  My friend really enjoyed her pea soup but the other girls didn't really rave about their dishes.   The desserts (I forgot which ones we ordered) were great! We all definitely enjoyed that.   The restaurant's decor is okay. It's somewhere between modern and classic. The lighting is really bad... Or good if you like it on the darker side. I like being able to see my food when I eat.",

    "text": "There's something about expensive dinner dates that stresses me out. What do you order that makes you #1 not seem like a greedy user or #2 not offend your date by ordering whatever is the absolute cheapest - like just a side of potatoes?  Well that was my dilemma prior to being taken here by Beau S. on 2/1/14 as his other suggestions for dinner secretly made me extremely uneasy, even though I wasn't footing the bill. While still not even remotely cheap, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that I could order something under the 9 zillion dollar range on their menu.   The restaurant is pretty but what stuck out to me is that there must be a thousand waiters standing around waiting to swoop in on any possible need you may have.   Based on the amount of pictures on Yelp, I had the duck ravioli ($27) and I really enjoyed it. (I presume) to prove to me that he does in fact eat vegetables since we last dated, Beau ordered Brussels sprouts and spaghetti. He said the sprouts were terrible and he ended up not eating them. His spaghetti looked as if it came from a can. I declined his multiple offers to try some because it looked so bad and let him have some of mine.   I'm not sure what the hype is over the bread basket. I had a good piece of French bread but it wasn't orgasmic like the other reviewers go on about.  Dinner lasted 36 whole minutes. We decided to have dessert elsewhere. The food was okay, the atmosphere was fine, but honestly, if I didn't have such a great dinner date, I probably would have forgotten I ate here. Who I was with was really the only draw about this place.",

I have eaten at Scarpetta many times and have never been disappointed.    The atmosphere is semi dark and very luxurious.  We had a terrific view of the Bellagio fountains from our table.  Since their pasta is so good we ordered three pastas and one main dish.  The three pastas were the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, the Short Rib Agnolotti  and the classic Spaghetti with tomato and basil.  Each one of these dishes are superb. Each one gets a 10 from me.  We followed the pasta by sharing a pork chop which was also excellent.   If you are looking for an outstanding Italian restaurant look no further.",

All the happy hour menu items are $7 (albeit small plates)! I had the duck & fois gras ravioli, short rib/bone marrow angnolotti, and pork belly all super great, rich and delicious! Washed it down with a glass of red. As typical with many restaurants here, some food items don't come out until 6pm due to kitchen prep time. Would definitely return.",

I hate going to a nice restaurant and getting crappy service. Our bill was $124 and we still have her $20 for bad service.

One of my friends had heard about the original NYC restaurant and it came recommended, so we were excited to try the LV outpost. The food did not disappoint. First, I'd like to give a shoutout to the service - our waiter was fantastic and actually remembered our food preferences, which is so nice of him. The service was speedy but they didn't hover - we never felt rushed, which was what every restaurant experience should feel like.  We started off the complimentary bread basket - this was the most amazing bread basket I've ever had. There are several varieties of bread - there is a non vegetarian bread too, so if you're vegetarian let the waiter know beforehand and they'll bring out the vegetarian versions only. For the table, we ordered the seafood antipasto appetizer. The kitchen did accommodate our request to have the seafood and the vegetables be separated to keep it vegetarian, which was class. My favorite of the vegetarian antipasto was the squash, which was perfectly complemented with the Calabrian tomato dipping sauce. Onto the main course - one of my friends and I shared our dished. We ordered the the spaghetti (no meatballs) and the parmesan ravioli. To finish off, we ordered the chocolate cake to share between the four of us. It was good, but the interior wasn't as molten as I would have preferred. One thing to note - they didn't add a candle for my friend's dessert, even though we mentioned it on our OpenTable reservation. Not sure if they don't do at all, or forgot to for us. Still, it was a great dinner and a restaurant I recommend dining at in Vegas, especially if you like pasta.",

    "text": "Leave the superficial snooty attitude at the door because this Scarpetta is everything but that. You'd think you'd be dealing with staff that think they have better things to do than tend to your every whim but you get just the opposite. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get a table looking out to Bellagio's fountains but we got somewhat of a consolation prize and sat along the windowed wine cellar.   Everyone rants and raves about their bread basket. I can tell you right now none of it is exaggerated. You get a wonderful medley of bread but the one that takes the cake is the stromboli bread. Packed with meat and cheese, you could easily fill up on them. Fight it kids. Fight the feeling! Eat one and just wait for your main entree to come out.  The roasted sea scallop was one of the largest scallops I've ever encountered. Plump, juicy and flavorful. It was served on steamed cauliflower with a splash of creamed cauliflower sauce. Both the scallop and cauliflower complimented each other perfectly. What kind of irked me was the menu described the appetizer as, \"Roasted Sea Scallops.\" When you see the word \"scallops\" you assume you get more than one. Breaking news. You only get one. It's big nonetheless but remember that you only get one.  Scott Conant's twist on the spaghetti may seem simplistic at first glance but once you taste it you can tell there is a lot more that goes on behind the scenes. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the dish fell short. The noodles were well undercooked. I like my noodles undercooked but with every bite, I could taste the rawness of the noodles in the middle. The cheese and garlic olive oil is already infused in the pasta but it was overly cheesy. I thought it took away from the tomato and basil flavor. What I did enjoy was the bit of spiciness you get. It gave the spaghetti some life.   Overall the service was nothing short of elegance but the food, with the exception of their bread basket, was painfully average.",

I ordered the short rib agnolotti which was beautifully prepared. The service was cold and rushed which absolutely ruined our overall experience. Although it seemed to probably resemble how it really is in Italy. Get in, get out, and good day. I would have really valued a \"spiel\" of the menu and the restaurant and maybe some suggestions. Not just \"are you ready to order?\" There are too many restaurants in Vegas to enjoy for me to ever return to this location.",

    "text": "Don't let anyone talk up pasta like it's going to change your life, it's just pasta... With that being said, the pasta at Scarpetta is pretty damn delicious. If you're going to pay $25 to $35 for a pasta dish, Scarpetta is the best place to do it.  We visited Scarpetta at 8 PM on a Thursday and sat at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender, Nicole, was a delight. She opened a bottle of Sauv Blanc for me since they did not serve any by the glass, and that's what I was looking for. I can always appreciate someone who goes above and beyond to make sure that the paying customer gets what they're looking for. The \"crack chips\" at the bar are highly addictive, don't even start...  We were seated shortly after taking a few sips of our drinks at the bar, near the window where we could see the Bellagio water fountain show. I was expecting the view to be more romantic and clear - there are beams and walls that are kind of in the way. Regardless, it's a very nice view (I just feel that they advertise it a bit differently than it actually is). The service was great and so pleasant. We ordered a braised short rib appetizer that was delicious, along with the spaghetti dish, pichi dish and the side of mushrooms. Everything was damn near perfect. I prefer my pasta a bit more cooked, but I can appreciate that the Scarpetta way is how it should be done, with hand made pasta, in house. The sauces are so amazing, the flavors are just perfect...  We didn't have any room for dessert but next time, I swear I will get into those bombolini nutella things, they were on every table and looked so good.  The ambiance is quiet and calm and it felt so good to get away from the chaos that is Vegas. I've eaten at many vegas restaurants and I feel that Scarpetta is perfect for a date and low key evening to enjoy one another's company and some GREAT italian food!",

When we walked in there was no hostess at the podium , so the very nice and attentive bartender went to the podium to greet us and acknowledged my fiance's birthday. Then the hostess finally came back and showed us to the table. The ambiance was very nice, we had a nice table next to the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains.   When our server finally came, he seemed very rushed and was VERY short with us. The appetizers were not listed on the menu, so we asked him what appetizers we had to choose from and he seemed irritated that he had to explain. After choosing our appetizers we also ordered our entrees before he could walk away.   My fiance had the beet salad to start with and I had the spring salad with \"blood orange\" dressing, both were tasty. Then we both had the short rib agnotoli which was delicious, however if you plan on getting stuffed this is not the place to do so since the portions are small.   Once we finished our entrees after quite some time, the waiter finally came back and we ordered some dessert. We waited about 10-15 minutes for our dessert! I've never waited that long for dessert in my entire life!   When it was time to pay, we gave the waiter our card. After he ran the card and had our bill in hand, he walked right past us without giving us our card back! After about 5-10 minutes he finally came back! Smh! We've had better service at the Cheesecake Factory!   Although the food was delicious, we just don't see ourselves returning to the restaurant in the future due to the bad service.",

Even though nearly every table was empty, we got sat in the back, despite every window seat being available, we got sat nearly two tables back.  The food was mediocre at best. I had the goat cheese ravioli and was bland at best. Was covered in some foamy like topping that tasted like soap.  The bread was good but wasn't served into nearly 30 minutes in.  Considering how empty they were, you would have expected service to be better but definitely could have used improvement.  Overall, definitely not worth the cost.

Their wine is is fair.  They had a couple of choices for 1/2 bottle pinot noir at a decent price. Oysters- The kumamotos (sp?) were pretty good.  They came with a vinaigrette added already Creamy Polenta- Very good.   Short ribs Agnolotti- The best dish of the night.  Loved the hint of horseradish amid the butter sauce Spagetti-  A tad on the bland side.  But liked the home made pasta. Creme Brulee-    Not your typical creme brulee.

    "text": "want to make it clear that this review is based on two things.  the food; and what I feel is arguably just as important if not more; proper billing/customer service.  let me start off with saying that the food is great.  I had the duck/foie gras ravioli and my wife had the New York strip steak, absolutely no complaints and the service while IN the restaurant was solid.  Paid the bill with a card (lets say it was for $200.51) and went home to the kids.  This was on 2/27...  a couple of days later I viewed by bank transactions and I see that on 2/28 I was charged 2 additional times for equal amounts (let's say they were both for $140.51).  I liked the food but I didn't like it that much to go 3 times within one weekend.  we're a middle class family who doesn't have that kind of income to justify that kind of spending.  so naturally I called my bank to dispute the charges and I called the restaurant since apparently they have to be on the phone to corroborate my story and fix the problem.  Since the restaurant is closed in the daytime I elected to leave a vm.  A few hours later I did receive a return call from someone who seemed genuinely apologetic and she said that the night manager would have to be the one who can truly solve the issue.  she asked if I could be patient and wait a few hours until they can get back to me....this was on 2/29  Today is 3/9, it's now been a week and two days later and I'm still waiting for that night manager to call.  I left a second voicemail today on the same line and my family is short roughly $280 in our checking acct.  so I had to call my bank again and explain how I still haven't gotten a call back and they did tell me that once my monthly transactions clear I should be able to dispute the charges and possibly get my money back next month.  if you're looking to go out for a nice dinner with your spouse/significant other I would think twice before going to a restaurant whose service level goes down to 0 once they have your money",

    "text": "Duck foie gras ravioli.  Really, the review could start and end with just those four little words. I mean, really, what else do you need to know? You're going to sit down, you're going to order that, you're going to enjoy it because, believe it or not, it's better than it sounds. And you're going to leave a very happy person.  OK - I guess a little bit more is in order.  I've been here three times now, and not once have I been disappointed. But the absolute highlight has to be the dinner for my 40th birthday.  (Yes, I know - cliche to visit Vegas for one's 40th. Don't judge. It was a blast!)  In any event, we made a reservation for 10 of us. That managed to land us in one of their private rooms (which I didn't request, mind you) overlooking the Bellagio fountains. That right there was enough to make us all feel like rock stars. And, as an added bonus, we got to control the lighting and music volume in the room (I really don't like the music they play there, but it's easy enough to tune out.)  The service we received was absolutely impeccable. The waiter came along and explained the entire menu to us, calling out the highlights. We did an appetizer course of our own mix and match - just ordering a bunch of stuff off the menu, including the above mentioned duck foie gras ravioli so everyone could have a taste. For my entree I wound up going with the lamb, which was out of this world spectacular - probably one of the top lamb dishes I've ever had.  The couple of little gripes I have - the wine menu is very expensive. I don't think there's much in the way of a bottle for under $80. The music (which I mentioned above).  Next time you're in Vegas and wanting a great dinner, this is an absolute must visit. It's a must visit for me every time I'm in Vegas.",

I think this is probably one of the better restaurants on the Strip. I enjoyed the ambiance and the view was relatively nice.   My fiance and I ordered the truffle mushroom polenta, the filet mignon, and lobster pici. Everything I ate was pretty solid. The steak was tender and cooked well and reasonably priced. The pici was a bit pricey, but it tasted pretty good and I appreciated that is was more unique than other pastas I've had. The sauce was nice and spicy and the lobster was cooked well. The pasta is homemade here which is a plus. I didn't mind paying more for it. The truffle mushroom polenta was also yummy considering the mushy texture of polenta. It was flavored well. Some of my friends ordered the Sphagetti with basil marina sauce (no meat) here and I had a try. I wasn't too impressed and wouldn't spend the 20ish dollars on it for something so plain and simple and without any meat. They raved about the sauce, but honestly I can get something similar at Trader Joes from a bag and I actually think it tastes better. Eek.   The service was okay. The only big negative is that they forgot my pasta, which was unfortunate.   Overall, I'd definitely come here again for the food if I want a nice decently priced fancy dinner on the strip and I wouldn't hesitate taking friends here.",

The ambiance, the service, the food all top rate.  The greeter/hostess at the door wasn't overly warm but I can get over that usually if the food and ambiance is good.    We could only get a 6 pm seating on a Thursday (and I booked a week ahead) so I thought that was a good sign.  When we got there it was EMPTY.  We got a great seat by the window.   It started to fill up during our seating.  We got a fantastic basket of breads and spreads almost right away.  The best bread I have ever had in a restaurant bar none.  I could go either way on bread before a meal, but this was outstanding.    My wife got the Tagliatelle which was light, yet filling enough for her to be full enough so I could play clean up at the end.  It was fantastic.  I had the duck and foie gras ravioli.  WOW.  Had a wonderful balsamic like reduction on.  They don't wow you with portion sizes, but I did not think one \"boy am I getting ripped off here.\"  Honestly the last thing I like doing is wasting food and in Vegas I don't want to be walking around with a to go box after a meal.  I'd say it was perfect portion sizes for the dollar.    The service was superb.  Almost too good.   We were in and out in an hour which was a little disappointing because we had a great seat in the place.  But that is the business.  Turn over.  I will say we didn't linger either as it was our first night in las vegas.    Definitely Recommended for people who want more from their pasta than the Olive Garden has to offer.",

Watching it being made I expected a fresh tasting tomato-basil sauce. What I received was an overly salted tomato sauce with no visible signs of basil that sadly reminded me of the sauce you get with spaghetti-o's (albeit not as sweet).",

I went and spoke with the manager, Kelly, who said she would do whatever she could to help me out. When we arrived at the restaurant she said she would see what she could do. We grabbed a drink at the bar and 10 minutes later we were told our table was ready. I was expecting the small corner in the table, but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated at probably the best table in the restaurant. The last table right next to the window which gave us an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains. Titus our waiter was excellent! The food was incredible as always! The night turned out amazing all because of Kelly. Great manager!!!",

We intended to sit at the bar because we thought there would be a wait at 9 on a Friday night, but they were able to seat us. The house bread basket was amazing. Three different types of bread with a paired dipping sauce. Along with the ravioli we ordered the scallops. Both were delicious. We had just tried the foie gras ravioli at Craft Steakhouse, and I think I prefer the filling there. But, the pasta here is so fresh and amazing. The scallops were on point as well! I would love to come back and try a full dinner here. The service was amazing as well, the server did not care that we were only there to try one dish.",

He seemed to be completely preoccupied with the couple at the table next to us. After our entrees were cleared and we declined dessert, we waited over 15 minutes for our check before we waved down a passing busboy and asked him to send Roberto to our table. Rather than coming himself, he sent the busboy with the check even though Roberto visited the table right next to us about 5 times after our plates were cleared. We were not rude to him in any way, shape or form so I can't imagine why he chose to behave that way. He came by to say sorry as we were signing the check. Too bad because the food and atmosphere were nice and it would have been a pleasant experience if he had made the slightest effort.",

Everyone I interacted with prior to dining and throughout our actual dinner was extremely kind and accomodating. Our menu was selected in advance and consisted of 4 spectacular courses all served family style except for the entrees: small shared plates (scallops, shortribs, apple endive blue cheese salad), 3 pastas (short rib bone marrow agnolotti, and another raviloi I forgot about bc I was drooling over the agnolotti), entrees (organic chicken, black cod, or ny strip steak) and dessert was these nutella filled doughnut holes rolled in sugar w/ a side of banana gelato, chocolate cake and cheesecake. Everything was delicious but if I had to pick one of each it'd be the short rib appetizer, the short rib bone marrow agnolotti, the chicken and the nutella balls. Go here if you have the opportunity!!",

They make their pasta in house, and it was delicious.  The sauce was also perfect.  One of my friends got the shortrib ravioli, and it was the tiniest portion ever.  The spaghetti was a good portion though, and the shortrib appetizer was also a good size.  My other friends ordered some special and changed it around about and weren't happy with it, but I think that's what they get for messing with the recipe.  Their bread was also awesome, it was cheesy with pepperoni, delicious.  I would absolutely come back",

    "text": "Fantastic service, delicious drinks, great atmosphere, but let's be honest what's the primary reason for going to a nice restaraunt?  The food.    We'll keep it simple, the food was meh for the price, and we are the type of people who are easily pleased. We started with the spiced artichoke soup.  It was brought out looking beautiful but it was bland:  light, but very subtle on the artichoke flavor and little to no \"spice.\"  Our entrees were the tomato basil spaghetti and the tagiatelle, a truffle pasta with veggies.  For $24 and $27 respectively we were expecting the best tomato basil pasta and truffle pasta we ever had.  Unfortunately we were not blown away.  Neither dish had anything special going on with them, other than the spaghetti being a perfect al dente.  Then we chose the chocolate cake served with an almond gelato and salted caramel.  Nothing special, seriously so dissappointed, although \"happy anniversary\" was written so beautifully on the plate it almost made up for it.  Looking back we should have gotten the bananas fosters because we heard about how great it is but unfortunately we didn't, because my wife wanted chocolate.  We were told the souffle (bananas fosters), marscapone cheesecake, and the filled doughnuts were the top 3 deserts.  We appreciated the staff and the service and we tipped well at the end because of it, however when you spend $150 on a meal, with just 2 drinks, you just expect a bit more from the food.",

I am  a retired restauranteur and your restaurant had many faults to make our experience a unpleasant one. The biggest is : we had a reservation at 6 30 pm. We were so rushed for our dinner it felt like they had the table booked for 7pm. We had taken one sip of our Martini and our appetizers were there. We weren't even done with our appetizers and our pasta was there. Then the weirdest thing happened; we had taken 2 bites of pasta and our entrees were ready, they had to bring them back to the kitchen. 2 good things ; wine pairings excellent, and the veal chop prepared perfectly. It had sweetbreads with it but we opted to not have them and it didn't need them. The worst was the heirloom tomato salad, we had to send it back because the tomatoes had no taste whatsoever. (the night before we ate a American Fish had gazpacho and a tomato app there that our first bite was OMG heavenly) We didn't have dessert because of our experience with dinner. Scott you should spend more time at your restaurant training your staff on the floor and in the Kitchen. i will not be going back to Scarpetta. It was not memorable.",

    "text": "What a giant disappointment. We saved Scarpetta for our final night in Vegas because it was my first choice of a new place to try. We won't ever return.  We had reservations at 6:30. We arrived at 6:24. I know this because the hostess pointed to the clock and noted that she would seat us in 6 minutes, since our reservation was for 6:30 pm. They were not busy -- no one else was waiting to be seated and only two people were sitting at the bar. We had to ask twice to check a coat, even though they have a clearly marked coat check.  At this point, we just figured the hostess was inexperienced or having a rough day. Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and placed our cocktail orders. Our drinks took almost 20 minutes to arrive -- although we could see there were fewer than 20 people in the entire restaurant and there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting. The rest of the night, the service remained scattered, at best. We were rushed through our first course, but had to flag down the server to order dessert.   On top of this, the server was constantly pushing us to \"upgrade,\" after telling us that most of the plates, as is, are pretty minimal and that most people end up having to add to them with a second round of orders. For example, I ordered the fritto misto salad, which runs $18. The server warned me I should order a second primi, as well. He wasn't kidding -- I got two bites of greens with a dusting of lemon and seasoning. In short, the portions are small even for an upscale, trendy restaurant.  This place has one saving grace: the tomato and basil spaghetti. I admit I'm pretty picky about Italian food after I lived in Italy for a summer. I understand that it's rarely as good in the States. Although it's not as good as you'd get in Italy, the tomato and basil spaghetti is done well here. It has a nice light sauce (it's not arrabbiata -- it's a pureed sauce), and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  I had the strawberry souffle for dessert. It was adequate, although it was fairly cool by the time they got it to the table. The coffee was fine, but the server forgot the extra shot of Frangelico I requested.  On the plus side, it's really beautiful. If you can get a seat in the windows, they overlook the Bellagio fountains (unfortunately, the window seats also overlook the Bellagio gardening sheds and dumpsters...so don't look down!). Overall, the decor fits in well with the contemporary vibe at the Cosmo. It's urban, beautifully designed, and hip. It's fresh, upscale, and open without being fussy or stuffy.  As beautiful as it is and as great as that pasta plate was -- I won't be back.",

The ambiance is quiet and romantic and most tables have a view of the Bellagio fountains. The bread has cheese and peperoni in it, like a litte stromboli. The grapefruit gimlet was good, not the best drink I had on this trip but dinner was amazing. I asked my waiter which of three pastas he reccomended and I was suprised when he reccomened the least expensive one. It was the ricotta and truffle pasta. It was very simple but everything worked perfectly together. Best passta dish I have ever had. My boyfriend the lamb loin which was perfectly cooked. We shared the panna cotta. I belive it was coconut and passion fruit. I would definitely reccomend the panna cotta and the pasta. The wait staff was friendly and just the right amount of attentive. Definitely my favorite restaurant at the cosmo!",

Though, you'd get a much better view if you were a party of 2 seated right by the window, of course!   Service was great! Our server gave great recommendations and the other wait staff were fantastic! They kept bringing basket after delicious basket of bread with that citrus-infused olive oil and refilled our drinks constantly!  We ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms to share, duck and foie gras ravioli, pan-seared escolar with sun chokes, American Wagyu rib cap and a lobster pasta  that was the daily special. The polenta was AMAZING!! We shared it but I was ready to order another for myself. The polenta itself was so fine that it added to its creaminess and then topped with the truffled mushroom sauce added to its heavenliness! All our entrees were delicious (as evidenced by the fact that nothing was left behind), except the  lobster pasta. While I enjoyed the fresh and sweet lobster and LOVE the freshly made chewiness of the pasta (think udon in terms of thickness), the combination together with the sauce was not incredibly tasty. It almost resembled a lobster bisque type sauce and I think it made the dish too \"seafood-y.\" Hands down our table's favorite was the American Wagyu rib cap - WOW!!! The meat itself was incredibly tender and so divine that it just melted in your mouth. Even without the sauce reduction that accompanied it, the beef was naturally flavorful and worth its price tag. You don't get much but, you definitely get a phenomenal piece of meat! As for the ravioli, like others have mentioned, it was a bit on the salty side and even before our order, I mentioned it to our server and he gladly told us that the dish can be altered to fit our tastes. The escolar, not on the menu, was perfectly cooked and just as juicy and flaky as fish should be - delicious!   Overall, the order came out to be a bit over $200 with 2 iced teas, 1 appetizer and 4 entrees. It was well worth the deliciousness that filled our bellies, the unique experience of being in such a gorgeous atmosphere and great service! I would visit again in a heart beat and save my $$$ for the next special occasion.",

We went again on our recent trip to Vegas and this time I was inspired to write a review.  Truth be told, I always thought it was good but not amazing. Until our last visit, that is. I'll cut to the chase here. What has me over the moon this time was the pasta special. Before I get to that, though... We booked a table by the window overlooking the fountains at Bellagio. Likely the best table in the place (excluding the amazing chef's table private room which we've had a few meals in also). View is great.  Our server, Jose, was a blast and we had a lot of fun banter and dialogue with him. I was ambivalent about what to order, as usual, and he told me the pasta special was \"ridiculous\" so I decided to be spontaneous and take his recommendation. Am I glad I did. We enjoyed their amazing truffled risotto and octopus for starters. I nibbled on my wife's risotto and it was indeed amazing. Some of the best I've had. The octopus was good but not amazing. I've had insanely delicious octopus and this wasn't that (Tasty n Alder has the best I've ever had in Portland). Anyway, on to the main dishes. My pasta was absolutely amazing. It was the special, which consisted of black squid ink pasta (I think it was squid ink, it was black) with little bits of swordfish, capers, and I don't know what else but it was heaven on a spoon. Literally the best pasta I have ever had, bar none. That is why this place is famous. When they nail a pasta dish like that, it is so good you can't believe you're eating pasta. One of the most memorable dishes I've ever had.  We were brought free dessert for our anniversary, which by then I had a hard time eating any of because I was so full (I had to polish off my wife's uneaten spaghetti too, of course). It was excellent, especially the panna cotta.  I'm a fan and looking forward to going back, which will inevitably be on our agenda the next time we go to Vegas.",

I just wish there were more options that didn't include pasta. I know Italians are famous for their pasta but c'mon, pasta isn't the only food they are famous for... and what.... there are no low carb Italian dieters??? If that's the case their workout regimen must be intense AF. I will definitely come back.. but on a cheat day :)",

    "text": "The food here was high quality, though slightly small in portion for price, but the service timing was tremendously off for a high quality place which was the biggest setback.    We waited well over 20 mins for our starter drinks, though randomly one person at our table got a glass of wine, while the rest of us sat waiting, and the timing on everything else with the service was excessively off. Our drinks went unfilled for extended periods of time (not the water) and other things that highlighted a real lack of attention on the server, whether over extended or just lacking, not normal for this standard of restaurant. It is tightly sat with lots of big party tables so perhaps the reach is too much, but food quality wise, it is excellent. It's a bit aggravating to me that the server wasn't around to address drinks and other items we shouldn't had to be looking for him for but was blazing fast to get the bill to us and closed in 30 seconds.   The one upside was that the service was not aloofly arrogant which can be standard with some places like this in Vegas.   Random note - I would not recommend the octopus for a group to share.",

Although, the ambiance is still nice and classy.   ::Drinks:: The Berry Smash was a hit but when I got it again, the flavor was different.  The alcohol was strong which was good but the drink was not as fruity.  ::Food:: I got the Lardo Wrapped Prawns before and I liked it, but on this visit it was too salty.  The Prime Filet of Beef was tender but there was no \"wow\" factor.  My highlight of the night is still the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti; it's so good!!  ::Dessert:: I picked the Nutella and Vanilla Creme Bomboloni.  It was warm and fresh but nothing special.    ::Customer Service:: The customer service was superb on my first visit.  The second time around, surprisingly it was not the same.  I was a bit disappointed.  ::Tips:: -Try the Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti! -Request to sit by the window so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain Show.  -Please read my first review for more information or if you are curious about my first visit.",

The best thing on their menu was their spaghetti. While their portions are tiny, they are rich in flavor.The spaghetti did not have an overwhelming tomato paste, it was very creamy and had the right amount of sauce for the pasta. I got their filet as my main entree. The steak was cooked to my liking - just melted in my mouth.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic.We had a great table right near the window where we could see the Bellagio fountains and the whole strip was right underneath us. The wait staff were great, my drink was refilled instantly, didn't even have to ask! I will be back here soon for sure!",

It was good. Actually, I'm craving it right now on the cab ride back home. The noodles are made in house and they were hearty with some chew. It wasn't the slippery Barilla spaghetti kind that you get everywhere else, even at many upscale Italian restaurants. The sauce was seasoned perfectly and you can taste the olive oil and tomatoes. More importantly, everything came out piping hot. The bread basket was filled with sourdough, cheese bread, and bread that was filled with Italian sausage and spinach. For dessert we got the chocolate souffle, which was an it too runny for my taste. I'd opt for the tiramisu next time.   The waiter was attentive and funny too.",

As an entree we decided to go with Black Tagliolini and Branzino. It was so delicious that my friend said: \"if I was allergic to one of the ingredients of this dish I would commit a suicide\". Can you imagine how great the food was... Yum!  Don't forget to leave some space for dessert. Their Chocolate Cake and Coconut Panna Cotta are simply delicious.  Scarpetta is a must try.

    "text": "I have a select group of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It is a small list of places I would go every visit, and even though I like to try new places, my special list always beckons...  The time has come to add a new place to this Elite list...welcome Scarpetta.  Reservation made for Christmas dinner 2015 (made it 3 days in advance), located on level 3 of the Cosmopolitan and we requested a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Upon being greeted by the lovely set of hostesses (who were very classy mind you), our request was honored, and our table was AMAZING.  We had some awesome servers helping us, our main waiter was Garvin (I hope I spelled it right). He was extremely nice, great attitude, plenty of \"just right\" conversation, funny, personable, and I could not have enough praise for his knowledge of the menu, Las Vegas cuisine, and his general awareness of what it means to be a good host for a restaurant. He gets 5 stars alone!  The ambiance is dark, seductive, and enchanting. The place is mostly \"quiet\" and intimate, with dim lighting, gorgeous wood flooring and well-appointed decor.   We ordered a couple drinks. I had a variation of the Moscow Mule  and it was superb. My gf (who always takes forever to pick a wine) had two she was interested in, and our waiter brought both for her tasting. She finally chose a Pinot Noir, and really enjoyed it.   Our appetizers were:  - Warm Beet Salad...AMAZING IN EVERY WAY! The temp was perfect. The beets were soft and tasty, the shaved parsnip was bitter and palate pleasing.  - Tuna and Avocado. This was divine. Tuna, Avo, micro greens...just perfect.  The bread basket (free):  - Yes, I will rave about the free bread. I don't normally even eat bread but it was Xmas Dinner so sue me! Haha...the stuffed \"Stromboli Bread\" oh my god. good. The sourdough, the ciabatta, the olive oil and rosemary squares...holy hell on a stick Batman...!! The bread was delicious and it came with an eggplant tapenade, marscapone butter, and a light olive oil...oh man...wow.  The Pasta:  - I got the Short Rib Agnolotti.  The flavor depth of the wagyu short rib, the bone marrow broth, the dark rich sauce and the fresh mini-ravioli pasta...was amazing. It didn't look like a huge portion, but looks were deceiving...it was a lot of food. This is now a TOP 5 dish favorite in Las Vegas.   - My lady got a Gluten-Free variation on the Spaghetti & Sauce. It was the same tomato and basil fresh sauce, with gf noodles and they added just enough garlic, olive oil and shaved cheese to it. This was simply an amazing spaghetti and sauce. I mean...wow again.  Simple, flavorful, and filling.   On the side:  - We added Brussels sprouts to our mains and they were great. Toasted macrona almonds with just a bit of smokiness. Lemon oil, garlic, oh man these sprouts were luscious. I am going to try to make these at home. This side alone was so worth it (seriously). Try them.  ***  ***  ***  ***  All of the food came out in good order to not clutter the table. The servers and staff always knew when to clear a plate or fill something. They were ever-present but not annoying. Honestly, the service was perfect. This was a great Christmas dinner, and one to remember for so many reasons...they even brought out a light dessert course for us since it was my birthday the week prior (with a lemon bar, a berry jelly candy, a chocolate, and little cookie).  If ever I write 1,000 words for a Yelp! review let it be Scarpetta. People, you cannot go wrong here. With drinks, appetizer, salad, and two entrees, we were around $150, throw in a well deserved great tip, and it was a delightful dinner, perfectly executed for under $200 in an amazing seat to see the Bellagio show and enjoy a quiet and intimate atmosphere.   I'm coming back soon, I promise!",

This location is a bit tricky to locate as it is tucked in a corner near Jose Andreas' place and next to D.O.C.G Enoteca.  The atmosphere is romantically dark and narrow but once past the bar, the floor to ceiling glass provides a spectacular view of the Bellagio Fountains.  If you are on a date, request to be seated next to the windows as all tables against the glass are two tops.  Service and Food were outstanding.  Although the spaghetti seemed to be the rave on Yelp and on tv, I thought it was good but not the best I've had.  My personal favorite was the truffle mushroom polenta!!  Highly recommend this dish.  The Apple glazed pork chop is also worth mentioning and it was slightly better than Wolfgang Puck's.  The roast chicken gets high marks especially the sauce that accompanied (chicken liver, onion and shallots)!  We ended the meal on desserts of Nutella & Vanilla custard filled bombolinis and the coconut souffle.  Nothing was left on our plates.  It was the best meal during our Vegas weekend.",

How silly of me to forget that EVERYTHING IS BETTER IN VEGAS. Here we go...  I had the MOST delicious pasta course I've ever had in my entire life. It was short rib ravioli with a balsamic reduction. I try, TRY! not eat bread except when I'm at a restaurant like Scarpetta. Then I will destroy the bread basket and order a refill. I'm gross but if I finally get carbs, I'm going hog wild. Oink.  Onto the entrees and wine. Pete had the Osso Buco and thought it was good. I had the branzino. I don't remember the sides, not to say they were forgettable, we were just so obsessed with the ravioli appetizer. The wine was great, as was the service. Expensive AF and make sure you make a reservation.",

The waiter split our meal - very thoughtful. There were two items that we ordered that really wasn't that great 1- carpaccio looks delicious the flavors didn't blend that well. Strawberry Souffle had great flavor but the sugar crystals was not good.   The bread is to die for.  The pasta was amazing. Overall very good!!",

The only minor detail that could have made it much better was the structural beam that went right across us at eye level.  Apparently the space was originally designed to be the kitchen and not the main dining room.  Anyway, the food, the meal, the experience.  We did the tasting menu which was AMAZING & EXPENSIVE but AMAZING!  To wrap it up in a nutshell we enjoyed duck, fish, scallop, shoe string calamari & zucchini, polenta with a mushroom broth, tomato basil spaghetti (famous on FoodTV), & decadent warm chocolate cake and delightful peach soupy thing for dessert. Yes!  All of that in one meal.  I almost needed a wheelchair just to get out of there.  Our server was so attentive and the wines that were paired with each dish was just perfect.  Heaven.  Enough said.",

Entrees: Short Rib Agnolotti: this dish was perfection. the little ravioli-like pieces were well stuffed with flavorful short rib and the toasted breadcrumbs were the perfect topper. totally recommended. Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: the richness of the filling makes it a dish to remember. c'mon it's foie gras! may be too fatty/heavy for one, but a delectable dish to share.  Spaghetti: took a bite of my friend's. pretty damn good for a traditional spaghetti dish, but it's really not like your mama's spaghetti at all. them al dente noodles were on point.  Chicken: chicken is just chicken, to me. wasn't particularly exciting. Prime Filet of Beef: this was another item for our table. pieces of steak were cooked med-rare, which made the pieces juicy. good, but not \"steak-house good.\"  The desserts were shared were the Grapefruit Panna Cotta and Bombolini. Both were so delicious! I'm typically hesitant about ordering fancy dessert, but these were worth it!   In addition, we got the perfect view of the Bellagio water show from our table. And to top it all off, our server (a mid-aged Asian man) was incredible hospitable, genuine in his recommendations and considerate of our party's needs. The service really made it a great experience for our bachelorette's dinner.   Scarpetta, thanks for making our Vegas trip a classy one.",

I ordered the Black Tagliolini with Dungeness crab and masago, which was very flavorful, but the real kicker was the texture and quality of the pasta.  Perfectly Cooked.  I also ordered the espresso old fashioned to drink which was very good.  Definitely a great meal in vegas, and the view is pretty special too.",

Our party of 4 booked a reservation on OpenTable the night before, and 8:30pm was the only timeslot left available.  Everything went smooth upon checking in.  They serve complimentary bread which is actually a variety of different breads which was pretty cool.   Unfortunately that was just about the only good thing of the evening.  The entire night we felt rushed by the waiters and the staff. Our waiter seemed impatient while we were ordering and even when they brought the food out, they would come up from behind us and put the food on the table and then disappear. It took forever to get more bread and refills on water.  Our waiter seemed irritated when we asked for more bread.  As for the food, it was meh. The best tasting thing was our appetizer, the grilled octopus and squid ($20).  For entree, I ordered the foie gras ravioli ($28) since I'd never tried foie gras before.  If it's supposed to taste wonderful, then I obviously ordered the wrong dish.  I didn't even eat half.  The two boys at our table ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti ($26) and it was good for the first few bites, but the taste was bland after you ate a few.  They didn't finish their pasta either.  I've definitely been better to Italian places, with much better service as well. Definitely won't be back.",

Our waiter didn't think that it was their chef that sold them so we were a bit disappointed but we got the spaghetti and the sauce was very similar! Our waiter was nice and took our picture for us with the view of the Bellagio but he mistook our order and we got spinach instead of broccoli. We still got charged and did not get our broccoli which was a bit sad . However, the truffle spinach was AMAZING and the truffle mushroom polenta was our favorite. The beers were okay and the free bread assortment and spreads were a great plus! Overall, very expensive and some great dishes.",

    "text": "In short; the food was five stars, the service was three stars.   I can't say enough about the food! We loved it! Unfortunately we had really bad service. We had two guys waiting on us. I don't know if the main waiter was busy or they were training, but it was obvious the second guy was more junior. He was trying to avoid saying, 'I don't know'. For example we asked what the parts were in the lamb three ways dish. We were told chops, short rib, and one other part that I can't remember right now. The chops made sense. When I commented that short rib was usually beef he agreed. So I said 'the lamb three way includes beef (which I don't eat)?'  He said yes. This sounded weird to us so we asked the first waiter and got a completely different answer. The dish included chops, shoulder, and a third type, maybe shank or something. Ultimately we decided against the lamb so I can't tell you what was really in it.   For appetizers we got yellowtail. There was three of us and I believe the portion came with five pieces. Instead of giving us an extra piece to round it out, they gave us three pieces and kept two in the kitchen. That seemed odd so we questioned it. The junior waiter apologized and said the kitchen staff was new. Who knows!!  The yellowtail was good and an additional serving came out of the kitchen.   We knew we had to try a pasta dish here as they are all handmade and Scott Conant does Italian food so well. We had a few dietary restrictions at the table so we ordered the tagliatelle. We were told that it came with short rib, but it could be brought on the side since I didn't eat beef. The pasta arrived and it was delicious!!!! We were told the kitchen was figuring out the short rib for us. Guess what? It never arrived! I wasn't surprised at this given how everything else was going. In fact I knew we were being duped the minute the waiter said it. The pasta was so good on its own so we didn't miss it or bring it up, but it was another problem with the service.   For entrees two of us got the halibut and it was amazing! My husband got one of the two beef dishes. The waiters disagreed on which one was liked best by patrons, but there weren't any problems with the dishes coming out incomplete.   For dessert we got the bomboloni. Oooh they were divine!  So again, food was top notch. There was not one thing that we did not like. I'm hoping service was only off the night we went. We weren't put off by it. We were actually laughing at everything that happened. It's a must try restaurant in my books.",

We started with some cocktails a White Russian and the berry smash.  For appetizers we had the yellowtail crudo and the scallops oh my..... the yellow tail melted in my mouth and the scallops were perfectly cooked.  We shared the world famous spaghetti and the spiced NY strip the spaghetti was perfectly cooked and let me tell you I'm not a fan of spaghetti but this was really good the sauce kinda tasted more like a vodka sauce.  I would definitely get again but next time with the mini meatballs.  The NY strip was good but I think if we are ever in Vegas again we would try the filet or the brazino.  For desert I had the coconut pan a cotta and my son picked chocolate cake with the toasted almond ice cream.  One word to describe the dessert.....decadent..... oh so good.  One of the better meals we have had in Vegas.  Will definitely be back here the next time we are in Vegas.

Shaved black truffle on top of truffle infused pasta? And so much parmesan. Everyone was sticking their forks in my bowl! For dessert, we got the orange souffle which was beyond decadent. I normally can't stand figs but the gelato was surprisingly incredible. Sinking my fork into the ramekin while the Bellagio fountain show went on in front of us was pure bliss.

I also tasted the pork chop with apple mostarda, which was tasty, but again I felt it lacked salt. The bread service was exceptional - breads stuffed with different things like salami and broccoli rabe, served with sides like citrus olive oil and caponata. Service was excellent. Based on the meal, I most likely won't return, which sort of saddens me because I really was hoping for a more exciting food experience.",

All of them were so friendly, knowledgable, and the service they provided was top notch. Our waiter Matt even gave us a plate of complimentary treats to congratulate me on my graduation from nursing school.   Now for the food. The drinks were great and even the bread basket was next level. The Stromboli were amazing as well as the spreads for the bread. The special carpaccio was outstanding providing bursts of flavor and texture. Then my creamy polenta with fricaseed mushrooms was out of this world life changing. My mom's squid ink pasta with crab and uni was unbelievable! And my duck and foie ravioli was so luscious. Our coconut Panna cotta was a wonderful way to end a fantastic meal.",

However two of the dishes we ordered were less than stellar, so that's why my rating went to a four.  I give the staff 5 stars, they were prompt and courteous and seated us at a fantastic table right next to the window so we could watch the Bellagio fountain.  We ordered four dishes and split them all.  They helpfully divided the food onto 2 plates for every course - much appreciated.  We started with the seared scallop, which was excellent.  Then we had the tagliatelle with vegetables.  The pasta was great but the veggie sauce was extremely salty, and I couldn't eat it.  Then we had the pork chop - an amazing dish, a real winner.  But we ordered the mixed mushrooms to go with that.  And though they were fresh and nicely cooked, they were flavorless.  It didn't seem like there was any seasoning on them at all, very disappointing.  We split the orange souffle for dessert, and that too was fantastic. So all in all it still was a great meal, and dining experience, and we would return to try again.  The good dishes were outstanding, it's too bad the other two weren't up to par.",

We were promptly seated by the hostess but st ther for like 10 minutes plus without anyone waiting on us.  Finally I got so frustrated I got up to leave and I told the waiter that was servicing the table next to me that I had had it and was leaving and he promptly apologized and said there must be a mix-up but that he would take care of me which he did....I think he threw in a free beer.  Anyway, the food was good...salad and pizza and the decor is nice.    I almost ever complain about service as I am very low maintenance but this lack of being initially waited on was very off-putting.",

Nothing was amiss in terms of service and cordiality.  Was very tempted to try the famous $24 spaghetti again but decided to expand my horizons and try something new.  (Yet we still had the creamy polenta.. orgasmic). Boyfriend had the Sheep cheese ricotta ravioli with truffle shavings and I had the Prime Filet of Beef - Med. Rare w/ potato puree... fricken delicious! I was naseous for most the day.. even at the beginning of our meal but I scarfed down the steak and finished off most of my plate.  Didn't care so much for the rainbow chard as I found it a bit salty.  Boyfriend agreed.  We completed our meal by sharing the Coconut Panna Cotta w/ Guava Soup - so good and regreshing!  Would come back just for that on a hot day if I could.  Our server was this tall guy w/ a beautiful Trinidad accent who had a very kind demeanor about him.  Forgot his name but make sure you get seated in his area. ^_^",

    "text": "I'd like to preface this review by saying I haven't had very many fine dining experiences. That being said, this is by far one of the best in terms of food quality and service. Yes, it is indeed pricey, but that should be expected with any fine dining experience no matter where you are.  I can only comment on the dishes I tried, so here they are: + Complimentary bread & spread - All of the bread was great. For our spread, we had olive oil, egg plant, and marscapone cheese. I've always preferred butter instead of olive oil, but this one was quite tasty. The olive oil had an almost herbal/spice taste to it. The egg plant is prepared with a tomato sauce or something, so it paired really well with the stromboli bread. + Roasted Sea Scallop appetizer - Delicious, practically melts in your mouth. The portion is rather small as you only get two. + Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Very rich to the point where it was almost a struggle to finish the plate, but it was so scrumptious, I couldn't stop eating. + Spaghetti - Probably one of the best I've ever had. Pasta perfectly al dente with just tomato and basil, but the sauce had a creaminess to it that made it divine. + Black Cod - Another great dish, but overshadowed by all of the other fantastic plates. It was seasoned well. The accompanying cherry tomatoes tasted so bright. If I ever go to Scarpetta again, though, I'd probably forego this dish and try something else.  Lastly, to expand on the service aspect, our waiter was very personable, cracking a few jokes throughout the night. He was helpful with making suggestions on the menu and explaining everything. Our water glasses never really went low. Oh, and the view of the Bellagio fountain was gorgeous. Only downside is the window divider thing was right at eye level, so we had to look above or below it to see. Definitely a wonderful restaurant for a date night, though.",

I started with a salad with burrata, mixed greens, beets and hazelnuts - well designed and delicious.  For my main course I had the babay goat (I think it's called capreto) - also excellent.  My table companions had the branzino (delicious) and the out of this world, must have lobster with black macaroni.  The desert was a chocolate cake, but the star of the dish was actually the accompanying gelato, served on some sort of chocolate crubms - yum  the bread here deserves a paragraph by itself.  Between the three of us we ate four baskets.  There was a big piece that they put on top that was good.  Inside there was bread with some kind of meat in it, delicious rolls, and then some sort of bread that they had toasted so that it was crispy - it came out crunchy and airy and was perfect with the marscapone butter.  My only complaint is that the wait staff hover around you and the second you finish something they come in an snatched the plate away.  It was very noticable - do they think that this constitutes good service?  But our waiter was excellent.  They have a good wine list, and the prices are good for this quality of food  So definitely go go go!",

Luckily the support staff was really fantastic. The menu itself can be a bit intimidating so I looked to our server for advice, he briefly listed ingredients to me, not taste which is very important for me.   Also one big thing we DID NOT LIKE, by any means, was not only being served from our right but from behind. During the course of service the staff kept reaching from behind in our booth which was not just annoying, but actually uncomfortable. We felt like school kids who were practically told to sit still. It was very odd....   The hits  were the short rib app, and the gazpacho soup   the foie gras and duck ravioli, which isn't as gamey as is sounds surprisingly and spaghetti was tremendous! :)",

This time I tried the infamous Scott Conant spaghetti & must say, it was really good. The flavors were alive & the pasta was perfectly al dente. Very good. Still, the NYC location is better. Even the bread basket was slightly off in Las Vegas but still good. I guess the difference in chefs changed things a little. Not to mention service was a little lifeless & cold.

    "text": "The worst part about Scarpetta is that you eventually have to leave. It was a sad moment when I took my last bite of amazingness and realized I was already having separation anxiety with my Duck and foie gras ravioli. Not to mention the mouth orgasm I had after over indulging in the Bombolini dessert with nutella dust. (Went back the following night for an encore performance ). I am not going to sit here all day and rave about how perfect the beef tartare was or how life altering the short rib angolottis were, but what i will do is tell anyone who has anything bad to say about Scarpetta, you honestly don't have a clue what good food is all about. I just read 30 reviews and one person had said \"The duck ravioli flat out sucked\" Dude STFU and have some respect. I guarantee you are the type of DB that enjoys the food at Olive garden. Get a grip. Here is my run down from a foodie who has traveled the world in search of great cuisine and spend 10 years running kitchens:  Service- From the hostess to the table service, everything surpassed my high expectations. Very attentive without being over bearing. Luis was very sociable and you could tell he wasn't trying to up-sell anything and he gave his honest opinion when needed. Very knowledgeable about the menu and was honestly fantastic.  Ambiance- Very comfortable, modern atmosphere complimented by great music and bellaggio fountains.  Food Quality- FRESH PASTA! Come on how can you complain about fresh pasta  I guess if you like rubber olive garden garbage pasta and you didn't enjoy the king of pasta's execution then your review is None.  Overall Food Experience- There is only one way to sum up Scarpetta so the common man can understand how great this experience is:   If you like the fake bread sticks and man made olive oil at Olive garden then you aren't going to like the FRESH baked bread and stromboli complimented by lemon olive oil, eggplant capanata, or marscapone butter.  If you like frozen pasta that been frost bitten for 2 years, then your aren't going to enjoy fresh made pasta stuffed with delicate meats such as duck or short rib.  If you go to the outback and are really wowed by the meat quality then you aren't going to understand the complexity of meat that they use here.   So for you complaining feeble minded yelpers, stay away from Scarpetta, you do not deserve to enjoy and embrace what this amazing restaurant has to offer. To the foodies who share my same enthusiasm for this amazing restaurant, you know how excited I am to go back.",

However, there is a horizontal opaque support bar right at eye level if you're 6'0, so you have to duck or stand up a little bit to actually look out the window.  Service was great as you would expect at any nice Vegas restaurant.  Appetizers were delicious!  We had the scallops and the polenta per our waiter's recommendations.  Among the best you can ever find among appetizers.  Our entrees were a different story.  I don't feel the spaghetti was that special.  A former reviewer referenced \"Asian hand-pulled noodles\" and was dead on.  Any quality housemade noodle will taste like this, and it is very basically seasoned.  Not quite a great entree in itself, especially a meatless dish for a carnivore like myself.  The lady got foie gras ravioli, as she is a foie gras FIEND.  However, even this dish came out a little salty with only a hint of foie gras detected.  The pasta was still good.  Maybe our expectations were too high after the appetizers.  We also didn't get any wine, though I heard the wine list is fabulous.  The price is very reasonable too.  We'd probably come back.  Well, there are a lot of places to try in Vegas, so maybe not.",

I saw the famous Scarpetta spaghetti on Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and since that episode, I have been obsessed with going to Scarpetta. So excited that one opened up in Beverly Hills last October! However, I've been too busy to make the drive out there.   I was in Vegas for 1 night on April 1st and while wandering around The Cosmpolitan Hotel, saw Scarpetta! Super excited! Made reservations for 8PM. Arrived on time and was seated promptly. Then waited, waited and waited! Really, 10 minutes before our waitress even came by our table (and empty seats all around us at this time)! Mind you, we had a 10PM show so I kept looking at the time... She took our drink order then returned 15 minutes later with our drinks!!! So almost 8:30 and have not even placed our order. She says she'll be \"right back\" and another 10 minutes.... Ahh, if it weren't for that spaghetti, we would have walked out! So 35 minutes after we arrived, she takes our order.   Spaghetti for me and braised short ribs of beef for my husband. OMG.. our food arrived at out table at 9:30! Ate fast (because we had tickets to a show at 10). BTW, the food was amazing!!!!   Had to ask another waiter to find our waitress so we can get the check. She came back to our table at 9:50 (without the check of course) and I explained again we had a 10PM show (which we ended up being late for) and needed to get out of there!   So the food was as good as I thought it woud be but the service (or lack of) ruined my first Scarpetta experience :(",

I came here with a bunch of colleagues from work, and one of the people in my dinner party was a well-to-do doctor who eats here often and knows everyone at the restaurant.  This is an awesome restaurant.  The view outside the panoramic window overlooks the fountains at Bellagio.  It's an amazing view!  I had multiple appetizers shared among my party, a pasta dish as an entree, and several desserts.  Everything was perfect.  I didn't get a chance to look at the bill, but I'm sure it was substantial.  Like several hundred dollars.  But it was worth the experience.",

My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they separated the bread into two baskets so the bread with the meat was not touching the other bread - that's service, right?  My only complaint would be the noise level, or the size of the two-top at whic we were seated.  I like a hum in a restaurant, but we were too far from each other to speak in our indoor voices and be heard.  If we were closer together it wouldn't have been an issue.  Pretty minor issue, really...last time I was here I sat on the window and didn't notice the noise, this time I was pretty much in the middle of the room between the bar and the window, so that could be it as well.  Perhaps next time we could request a window seat.",

    "text": "400+ positive reviews says it all.    Scarpetta was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in Las Vegas, and one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to. Our group of 8 got a semi-private room facing the Bellagio fountains, and from the moment we stepped in, the service was just top notch. Our server was professional, attentive, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave some great pasta recommendations...and it didn't hurt that the pastas, for once, were actually big enough for a person to have as an entree. I went with the sheep milk ricotta agnolotti with truffles and parmesan (TO DIE FOR!), but the real hit at our table was the lobster pici.  It's always the little touches that push a restaurant into 5-star territory for me, and at Scarpetta, it was our fantastic server bringing us a free tiramisu (also to die for...and I don't even like tiramisu!) for bringing one of our dishes out a tad late, and a plate of Italian cookies with a chocolate \"Congratulations\" message on the plate after finding out that one of us was getting married. If I can get a table, this is an absolute must-visit every time I go to Vegas!",

    "text": "I don't eat Italian food too much so this was definitely a different experience.  It was my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and we came with a party of 16. The server was knowledgeable on the menu. Recommended a few good dishes. Since we were a party of 16, I understand we probably took a little longer to order as we were all deciding on what to order, but the server did not rush us at all. Everything came out in a timely manner.  They had 3 different types of bread with three different spreads, butter, some eggplant tomato-y dip, and citrus herb olive oil (definitely the best one). Just that alone was yummy. Most of us skipped an appetizer as we weren't too hungry. One guest, however, did order their yellowtail. The few bites I was able to sneak were tasty! It had a citrus flavor to it, and if you know me, then you know I drown everything in lemon. For the entrees, I ordered their lobster pasta dish. It was very pleasant. With higher end restaurants, dishes tend to be more salty or over seasoned, which I cannot stand, but it wasn't at all. The pasta was thick and cooked perfectly. I was also able to taste the foie gras. I've never had it before and did not like that at all. The guest who ordered it, however, usually loves foie gras and didn't like it either. She said it tasted too bland. She wanted to speak to someone about it, but the waiter hardly checked on us. I also tried the short rib and bone marrow pasta dish. It was delicious. I loved the fried garlic to give it more of a crunch.  For dessert, most of us ordered their Nutella dessert, which by the way, is superb! I grew up on Nutella, and it brought me back to my childhood. It was pretty much sugar donuts filled with warm Nutella with a side of banana ice cream. Yummmmmy. Another couple at the table shared their guava dessert. It was the perfect mixture of fruits, not too sweet either!  Now for the bill splitting. We all individually calculated how much was going on each card, which was extremely time consuming and inconvenient that we had to do it ourselves, since he \"couldnt do it\".  The bill altogether wasn't too bad, and they didn't charge gratuity for that large of a party, but for this nice of a restaurant, I'd expect atleast a little happy birthday for my brother in law, but oh well. The food was worth the price. I recommend it, but I'd have to try other places before I decide on coming back.",

    "text": "I am a fan of Scott Conant from Chopped fame but I have to say the Las Vegas outpost of his iconic NYC restaurant just did not live up to the hype.  I went with a group of guys and we ordered the tasting menu.  They were nice enough to allow us to order it on a Friday night since it is usually not offered on that night of the week.  We tasted 8 dishes for $110 pp.  The quantity of food was great - really full at the end of the meal - but most of the dishes were just ok.  The real highlight for me was the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms.  Wow, that was delicious.  Probably the creamiest polenta I've ever had and it paired so nicely with the earthiness of the truffles and mushrooms.   The chocolate cake served for the dessert course was also terrific, served with toasted almond gelato.  Too bad I was so full by that time I could only have a couple of bites.  Nothing else was particularly memorable.    Disappointing for me was the restaurant's signature spaghetti - a seemingly simple preparation of pasta, fresh tomatoes and basil.  It arrived very simply plated -  a perfect cylinder mold of spaghetti covered by a clear plastic cloche that I suppose is meant to preserve the freshness of the preparation or perhaps to concentrate the aroma.  The cloches are removed with a flourish releasing nice smells of tomato and basil.  The pasta was a bit overcooked and the sauce, while wonderfully creamy (how do they do that?) was just too sweet, as if Chef Conant and Chef Boyardee had a bastard love-child.  Another disappointment was the black cod.  In the past I have found this fish to be among the most delicious owing to its high fat content and buttery texture and flavor.  Scarpetta's rendition of this fish, pan-roasted with concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel, was so overcooked that it was unrecognizable as black cod.  Just a piece of fish.  Other dishes were a bit more successful including the raw preparation of yellowtail and tuna, the diver scallops, the short rib/bone marrow agnolotti and the duck breast.  The wine list is voluminous and expensive.  The cocktail menu offers some nice selections.  There is certainly a lot of eye candy to be enjoyed at this swank place in the Cosmo.  However, one annoying thing was the lighting.  Over every table there is a large fixture containing multiple yellow/gold colored lights.  This lighting casts the food in a weird color and makes taking pictures of the food impossible.  All the food looks bad in the pictures I took - I suppose that's no surprise that the pictures were a disappointment too.",

    "text": "My husband and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Scarpetta and were seated by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Very romantic.   As much as I tried to save room for the main meal, the bread basket with an assortment of carbs along with mascarpone butter, roasted eggplant spread, and lemon infused olive oil was too hard to resist.  I even asked for a refill of the rosemary focaccia, it was that good.   We ordered the following: APPETIZER:  *Roasted sea scallops- 2 perfectly cooked giant scallops that melt in your mouth.   PASTA:  *Duck and Fois Gras Ravioli in a marsala reduction *Spaghetti with tomato and basil Both dishes were fabulous and I highly recommend both.  I would easily order either dish upon my return visit.   MEAT: *Pancetta-wrapped veal loin- with sweetbreads and vegetables *Halibut with vegetable puree Again, both were delicious but if I were to come again, I would definitely order the Halibut over the veal loin.  DESSERT: *Napoleon- creme brulee, macadamia tuilles, blood orange sorbet *Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce Both were decadent, but I personally preferred the chocolate cake more mainly because the salted caramel sauce was divine.  If I could order just a bowl of salted caramel sauce, I would in a heartbeat.   When you dine here, you will not be disappointed.  The servers are attentive and friendly.  The food is excellently prepared. I can't wait to come back and try other items.",

    "text": "As much as I am critical regarding the outlandish folly that which is the Strip, there are, in my opinion, a few exceptional culinary experiences that you can only get here and nowhere else; with breathtaking, majestic feats of visionary engineering, the Strip personifies man's ability to create way beyond his present environment and envision a future filled with unlimited possibilities.  And when a night on the town includes that man-made wonderland, you get magic, an 'Umami' of all the senses.  Scarpetta by Chef Scott Conant encompasses that dining experience, and out of all his venues bearing the same name, I enjoy the Vegas restaurant by far.  Although all the restaurants are elegant with great food, this restaurant takes the Vegas experience and showcases style with understated design gestures.  'Scarpetta' means little shoe in Italian, a reference to the menu's 'soulfulness'...  Guess my mind wandered to other references...like, the foot fetish variety - shrimping anyone?  No? Too far?  The design is deceptively tame; meaning that it's not drenched in the typical Vegas gaudy, interior so-five-seconds ago gimmicks that cause visual Norovirus.  But once you situate and settle down, you notice the lyrical design flow lending itself to a relaxing, calming evening. By then the Fountains at the Bellagio will have sprung into full effect, with sweeping side views of the Lake and the beautiful architecture as a backdrop for the dynamic geysers bursts - a stunning piece of visual entertainment lasting the night.  After dining at Scarpetta on numerous occasions, I've come to the conclusion that although everything on the menu is good, I naturally gravitate towards the Pasta section of the menu.  I enjoy all of the home made pastas and the balance with the ingredients that Chef Conant pairs with them.  And to be honest, I'm just tired of entrees, they've become burdensome, overpriced and unusually large with the same old formula: big ass protein with some creamy mush underneath it with a side of blah..yawn.  If anything, I'd get some apps, but I've eaten most of them on the menu; I do recommend the Creamy Polenta + Fricassee of Truffled Mushrooms, The Heirloom Beet Salad and the Braised Shortribs of Beef. (They push the Yellowtail as their signature classic- really...if I wanted Sashimi, I'd go eat at a Japanese restaurant where it's served pure, you really don't need any heavy Onions or Olive Oil or Jalapenos to mask the flavor of this delicious protein.....TRUTH).    Spaghetti + Tomato +Basil: An all time favorite of mine, this dish is as simple as it can get (it's up there with Spaghetti all' Aglio Olio e Pepperoncino) but so fresh and light with just a few ingredients, the Pasta shines through as the main character which, being the carb addict that I am, is harmonious!  It's presented as the first dish, based on its levity and absence of protein.    Ricotta + Truffle Agnolotti: The second dish in the fete de pasta is a deep contrast to the acidity of the prior dish, the fluffy pillows filled with Ricotta and covered in a light Truffle Cream Sauce.  I love using the term 'pillows', it describes these soft chewy bite size packages of pasta like a metaphoric squishy rest to the head; that, \"ahhh\" moment when your cranium sinks into a downy cloud.....I love sleep..  The creamy Truffle white sauce has just enough weight to coat your palate without any buyer's remorse and the quantity is perfect for two.  Black Tonarelli + King Crab + Coddled Egg + Smoked Trout Roe: I'm always excited when I see Squid Ink Pasta on any menu - I relish the slightly briny noodle that goes well with all Seafood toppings.  With this dish, it's even more decadent with the introduction of the Coddled Egg, coating every strand with a sticky liquid goo. It's such oral satisfaction.  Oh, and there's Crab, you really can't go wrong when there's Crab.    Pici + Lobster +Preserved Tangerine + Bottarga: Pici is thick cut pasta, a fat spaghetti, akin to Udon.  It is hearty and appropriately the last pasta course of the evening.  The Pici is paired with Lobster, Preserved Tangerine and Bottarga, a cured fish roe.  The Bottarga amps up the salty briny element while the the juicy Lobster gives a sweet delicate flavor - all the ingredients manage to balance out with the Pasta.  Caramella Milk Chocolate Mousse + Sauteed Yellow Peaches + Praline Crunch + Pistachio Bastoni: Okay, this was a bit of a surprise-under our waiter guidance, we ordered this dessert for the first time... this plate of what can only be described as a kindergarden art project with chocolate squares and pistachio logs....  I wonder if the chefs are so bored that they need to play with the food and at the same time give us less.  And in the end, it didn't really have much flavor as compact as it was- it was like a plate of Mignardises that usually come with a post-meal hot beverage.

    "text": "Was here this past year for CES, and we had 2 events here. One was our company dinner in the private room with a view of Bellagio Fountains and the other was a upper management meeting with a client over wine tasting in the private seating area which is in the kitchen.  For the wine tasting, it was pretty awesome, except the room is probably equipped to seat 8 people comfortably, maybe 10, we squeezed in 12.  We enjoyed some awesome wines and some desserts, which hey mistakenly sent to our table, so they ended up comping those and bringing more, it was very good.    The cool thing about this private room, is that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it and it is located next to the kitchen, with glass floor to ceiling so you can see into the kitchen as they work and cook and the background is a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip.    The second occasion was for our company dinner a few nights later since they were able to accommodate our group of 16 in the private dining room that is in front of the restaurant and our big boss loves Italian food.    Although you can order single entrees off the menu, we had our waiter set up our dinner family style with some of his recommendations and some of the things we wanted to try.    Also, our big boss had a request for something off the menu and the chef obliged with no problems.  Keeping the boss happy is always key!  We had the following dishes. Apps - Braised short rib of beef, Creamy polenta, Raw yellowtail and Tuna Susci the short ribs and the polenta were my favorite, the Susci was just ok.  Entrees - Duck and Foie Gras ravioli, Short rib agnolotti, Sheep milk ricotta agnolotti.  All were awesome, but the duck and foie gras raviolli is very rich.  We had dessert, but I don't actually remember what I had.  Service was great and except the bar was slow, so they comped certain drinks that didn't show up in a time fashion.  The minus one star was for the Sommelier, who seemed to enjoy the sound of his own voice and didn't really consider the requests of the guests at the table.  I understand he is very knowledgeable and he is an expert, but he could dial back the ego and work with the guest.    Other than that, great place, I recommend it and you will not be disappointed.",

As you can tell from the number of stars we were less than enthralled  with the food but especially the service.  To start, Two of the appetizers were served cold and on the main course one filet was overlooked and one meal for some reason didn't arrive until almost everyone was finished with their meals  At no time did anyone even come over to ask how the meal was.  Given the owners background and supposed attention to detail it was a total disappointment.   In a town with so many choices Scott conant and Scarpetta have been \"chopped \" from my list of places to go.",

Started off with the short ribs; then the duck and foie gras ravioli (our favorite--so good!); I had the spiced duck breast, and my hubby had the halibut. Halibut was delicious! My duck had a little too much star anise in the rub. Ended with the napoleon, so yummy, I cleaned the plate. We sat right next to a window and had a great view of the Bellagio water show. Had a wonderful time!  And the service was impeccable! The staff was very professional and friendly. According to our receipt our waiter was Asato. Great guy. Next time I hope to catch Chef Scott there!",

    "text": "If you are looking for a fancy meal to splurge on, look no further. We were looking for a $$ place but this is more of a $$$ in my opinion. However, it was WELL worth the money!  I called and got reservations day of at 6 pm, when they open. I had asked for seating near the windows as I had read that there was quite the view. They said they cannot guarantee this but we ended up with an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains and most of the strip at sunset.... the view alone was at least 4 stars!  But then.... the food.... OMG. The bread basket they brought us was an appetizer in itself. The stromboli with broccolini was my favorite! (Vegetarians, you can ask for the stromboli without meat to be in your bread basket.) In addition, the other bread was awesome and it came with citrus olive oil, marscapone butter and some sort of eggplant antipasto. We ordered a side of the broccolini to share and two entrees: the halibut (this was a special) and the spaghetti.  Why, you might ask, would you pay over $20 for a small plate of spaghetti? Because this unassuming dish was bursting with flavor and freshness. The pasta was homemade and perfectly al dente, the sauce was just chunky enough and the fresh ribbons of basil were the perfect garnish. My husband said he didn't miss the meat and it was just perfect- however you can add meatballs for extra money. The Halibut was also perfectly done: crisp on the outside and white and flaky on the inside. It was served with potenta and grilled artichokes. An excellent dish if they have it on special when you go!  You thought it couldn't get better? Well you are wrong. The service was ON POINT. Our waiter(s) were checking in on us the perfect amount of times, our water glasses were always full, and we were asked if we wanted another drink two sips before we finished the first. It is obvious that customer service is high quality here- from the wait staff to the host to the kitchen staff.  HIGHLY recommend if you are looking for a place to treat yourself to a wonderful dinner!",

Don't get me wrong there are several good places that the meal fits the price. Scarpetta is one of those places! I came here 2 years ago. I was on a date w/ my gf and I wasn't feeling well. So much that I didn't eat very much on that visit. Last month we did that date night all over again. She has always been a fan of Scarpetta.  Scarpetta is looked by where the Bellagio fountains are. So if you can manage to make a reservation, request a table by the window to get a dinner and a show. However if you don't, the amazing food will certainly make up for it.   Pici - lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga (OMG! OMG! SO GOOD!) Spaghetti - tomato & basil  She said she always gets the spaghetti. It's basic, but it's oh so good. She's right, it's SO GOOD! She mentioned that she hasn't ever had a bad experience at Scarpetta.  The dimly lit dining room is perfect to get lost in. The staff is 5 stars, they are certainly knowledgeable. Very good vibes.  Can't wait to go back!",

It's located on the 3rd floor where many of the other restaurants are, near the Boulevard elevators. My friends and I came for restaurant week to try their dinner pre fixe menu. My selections were:  Creamy polenta- this was my favorite! They topped it off with some truffle mushrooms. It has a little bit of a kick, very creamy, smooth, and delish. Spaghetti- noodles were perfect aldente with just the right amount of sauce.  Nutella bomboloni- sugar coated doughnuts with nutella inside. It was pretty basic.  Lets not forget about the bread basket! Your table will get a variety of breads as well as mascapone butter, lemon olive oil, and an eggplant spread. The breads alone got me full! I think there were 4 types. The ones I can remember were.... rosemary bread, sourdough, and the salami and cheese.   I was very impressed with the service. They have a great system of distinguishing each persons order. For each course, a different server brought out the dishes, and they knew what dish to place in front of you without asking who ordered what. Our main 2 waiters made sure our waters were always filled and cleaned away the used dishes/utensils promptly.",

I have never had a sub par experience any of the times I have eaten at Scarpetta. The first dish I ever tried here was the Pici. It's lovely and still a favorite. The lobster is poached so nicely it's very velvety and the dish itself has a nice spicy kick. My absolute favorite that I get every time is the short rib Agnolotti. I love the flavors and the tasty short rib inside every bite and I love that this plate isn't too much so I have room to have dessert after. Their prime filet is also one of the best steaks I've ever had, much to my surprise. I have spent a lot of money on really expensive cuts of beef at fancy steakhouses all around Vegas but honestly the filet here at Scarpetta trumps most of Vegas. If you're thinking about maybe trying this place, definitely do! There is something on the menu for everyone and the view of the Bellagio fountains is really gorgeous. Also, the service here is excellent.",

For our main courses we tried the pork chop, veal chop, duck breast, and spaghetti. I can't stop talking about the pork chop! So much flavor! Definitely my favorite out of the four dishes. The spaghetti is such a simple dish- but a classic and they made it perfectly. The veal was very tender and my husband loved it. I think out of the four dishes, the duck was everyone's least favorite. We HAD to try dessert so we went with the cheesecake and chocolate cake- both amazing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly, the service was awesome. Highly recommend and we'll for sure be back!   Update* went back to Scarpetta and the menu was totally different and our waiter was not as friendly or knowledgeable. The food was still good but this time around I was a bit disappointed and I don't think I'll rave about it AS much.",

Imagine waiting to take your spouse to a restaurant on her birthday, being seated at the bar while waiting for a table- bartender was Extremely Rude, wasn't patient (seemed like she knew we won't dine on bar so she wouldn't see tip- and decided to give us an attitude for no reason)  and having cold and non fresh bread served, dishes were very poor and average - we were hungry and waited to be seated so obviously we wouldn't get up and find a different restaurant when celebrating a birthday, we almost did if we weren't so hungry. Service was average, waiter was nice but other times we were there servers would understand our vegetarian diets and try to incorporate a custom dish or something that's available, this time the answers were very limited, and there was no willingness to help beyond. Dessert came Burned, at the end when we asked to speak with The manager, Mike the assistant came up to us and just explained us in loops that if we come again and \"give him a call before\" he will make sure we are treated properly, that's a ridiculous answer for customers who come to celebrate a birthday and spend the time and money, get below average service, below average dishes, Attitude from a bar tender and then you got the assistant telling you to come again and he'll make it better, you should of make it better at the spot. Don't recommend, non consistent restaurant, poor service and attitude - seems like they are failing to pretend to be upscale. Other places will appreciate your business far more.",

Ok now I know spaghetti seems basic and not very exciting but I can honestly say I had the best bowl of spaghetti/pasta, ever, at this restaurant. Homemade pasta was perfect al dente and how they made such a simple tomato and basil sauce so savory, so delicious just blows my mind. I added the meatballs to make it over the top. The make tiny little meatballs but they are big on flavor. My wife had the short rib agnolotti, it was rich, savory and the pasta was cooked just perfect. We watched the Bellagio water show as we enjoyed this great meal, doesn't get any better. Until next time. Ciao Bella",

We were able to get an early reservation the day of for a party of two and there were several tables open when we arrived so you might be fine just walking in.    The som helped us with a delicious bottle of wine in our price range.  To start we had the braised short rib with risotto cake and veggies.  It was a huge let down to start the meal. Think chicken pot pie down to the peas, carrots and corn. It did not match the vibe of the menu or ambiance at all and I would not recommend this dish.  I would, however, highly recommend everything else we ordered. The tagliatelle bolognese was rich and filling. The True star was the spaghetti though. I could not get over how dynamic and flavorful it was! So delicious and famous for good reason! Get this dish no matter what! And I can't pass up a dessert with amaretto in it so we split the chocolate cake with amaretto ice cream and drifted out of there blissfully content.",

We had eaten at the tapas place in cosmo the night before, and thought we'd try out Scarpetta. It's very unassuming in the corner, since it's surrounded by the other more in-your-face restaurants there. When you enter, you go through a narrow hallway of more romantically set up tables, then the main room is a huge glass wall overlooking the Bellagio fountains (mostly set up for larger groups). This was the perfect setting for us.   Food was amazing. We got multiple drinks, multiple apps, and a pasta meal each and our table of 5 paid less than $100 each somehow. We were fully prepared for $200+. Highly recommended for an impromptu, low effort, perfect meal.",

Well, we got a table next to a view table, at the very back of the restaurant.  Not a primo location.  Then, we started off well with our server, and ordered drinks and salad.  All was going well.  The restaurant was filling up, and our server was gone all the time....  Anyway, the food was delicious  The service started well and went to poor as he had too many tables. And, for a birthday, they did not provide the good table requested two weeks in advance, nor do they really acknowledge the birthday.",

Well this is not one of those places!!! This is a life changing experience in all things Italian..i.e. Pasta!!!   Entering this restaurant your first impressions are, this place is fancy and nice.. beautiful layout.. ask for a window seat to look over the Las Vegas Strip.  My Wife and I when seated, were greeted with a delicious assortment of breads and focaccia to die for.   We started our meal with the polenta with mushrooms and truffles it was creamy and decadent! 8/10 delicious!   Next for our main dishes-  I ordered the fabled $25 dollar simple basic Tomato basil pasta dish... it arrived in a decanter and unveiled in front of you.. it is molded into a tight little ball and then unravels into a full dish.. I take my first bite and Wowwwwwwww!!!!!! Mind blowing!! Delicious is to weak of a word for this pasta!! Im italian and this is multiple levels in flavor ubove anything i have experience with such simple ingredients!! It is creamy almost like a vodka sauce.. but after watching how its made.. its the blending of butter and parmigiana cheese i would pay twice the price for this dish! 10000/10  My Wife ordered the ravioli with duck and foie gras with a balsamic drizzle... also fantastic!!   This is one of the best food experiences I ever had and I have traveled the world tasting food!! Bravo Scarpetta!!",

With so many other amazing restaurants in Las Vegas... especially Italian restaurants, I would recommend others over this place.",

    "text": "Been here twice. First time I would rate it 3 Stars, mainly bc the server we had seemed to be in a hurry and I felt rushed during our visit. Food was great though!!!  Second time,  Had reservations for an anniversary dinner, we were seated almost right next to the window, too bad we didn't walk in 10 minutes later (the couple sitting at a window spot literally walked out 2 min after we sat down, but no big, we still got a view of the fountains). Our server, Jenny was very nice and attentive, congratulated us on our anniversary and I didn't feel rushed at all. We didn't have many questions, but based on observation, she seems very knowledgeable.  I got the duck foie gras ravioli and my bf got the lamb tangliatelle. Both were delicious! And love the bread basket! The lamb was well seasoned and the foie gras tasted like a familiar Filipino dish to me, so it hit home. Previously, I had also tried the Kobe beef and squid ink pasta, yum yummm! Squid ink pasta is a big Italian thing, but if you're more a fan of that seafood taste you might not favor it. The kobe beef was cooked perfectly and again, seasoned well.  Food came out very fast as well, maybe like 10 min after ordering! Wow!   For desert we got the panna cotta and the souffle, both were delicious once again. Previously, I had also tried the Nutella bomboloni and the cheesecake, all were good! And for our anniversary they left us a special message. :) (see pic).  Overall, a nice date night location, not too pricey, good food. Perhaps the service might be a hit or miss, hopefully they can fix that because Jenny was great... and I don't remember the name of the server from the first time. I'd recommend checking it out though!",

The view was beautiful.   Came here for a friend's birthday dinner (happy birthday Aileen) last night and had a pretty good experience. The waiter and staff were pretty friendly but they could have filled the water cups more often.   Scarpetta offers a complimentary bread basket with a couple different types of bread. One is even filled with cheese and meat!!  It comes with sides of marscapone butter, eggplant and olive oil. They weren't skimpy with seconds so I really liked that.   I ordered the black tagliolini that comes with Uni, crab and roe. The presentation was beautiful. The roe on top really contrasted the black pasta. I thought it was pretty delicious and the portion size is deceivingly bigger than you think it is. I was super full half way through although I did load up on bread. I did see couple of Uni chunks in my pasta but the flavor wasn't that strong. I would have preferred if the Uni really popped. Overall I liked my pasta. It was warm, very creamy and very decadent. Lots of crab meat as well. I also tried their side of mushroom which was delicious and buttery.   I thought their spaghetti was just a ok. The waiter said it's very simple but very popular. It had good flavor. The sauce was creamy and on the sweet side but I would definitely try more exotic things on the menu. The short rib agnolotti was super good. It was on the sweeter side with a brown butter sauce but I thought it was delicious!  The portion is less filling so order something else if you have a hungry appetite.  As for the drinks.. They were good and pretty strong but comes but a decent price tag. Most at $16.",

We had the table one in from the window and still had a great view of the show.   I read about the delicious Bread Basket so I was ready by just ordering the Diver Scallops and Braised Pork Belly.  Smaller size but Excellent. I'm not sure which was better- I mean how can anyone choose between scallops and pork belly?  There were only two scallops, but they were large enough to be 4 bites each.  My daughter had Tagliatelle with Lamb Bolognese and Fresh Barratta cheese.  She was less thrilled because she preferred a Columbus Ohio Lamb  Bolognese and Gnocchi.     For desert they had a chocolate cake with almond gelato and salted Carmel sauce.  They also had a chocolate souffle with vanilla gelato.   I wanted a different combo and they did it for me.  Souffles and almond with salted Carmel.  Heavenly.  If you ever have a chance to get Chocolate Souffle, take it.  Life is too short. Two Dinners with 2 cocktails and 2 deserts  was 120$. Which is about what is to be expected. Would highly recommend.  The business acquaintances at the window didn't notice the Fountains dancing, but we did!",

    "text": "Simply amazing!  Awesome good, fantastic service and great ambiance!  Can't get any better than this!  Went for Mother's Day/mom's birthday and they did not disappoint!  We were on a time crunch because the restaurant opens at 6pm and we were trying to catch Celine at 7:30.  We made reservations and got there and was promptly seated at 6.  We told our server, Johnny, of our situation and he just rocked it.  We already reviewed the menu before going in but it was Johnny and the staff that really made the magic happen.  Below are some of the dishes we had (sorry, they're not the fancy names but I don't remember them so I'm going to just make them up and you can try to figure it out).  All noodles are made in house and perfectly cooked.  Noodle plates were about $25-35 each.  1.  Black noodles.  ONE OF MY FAVS.  Sooooooo good!!!  They piled the roe on it and it was aaammmaziinng.  It was like having wonderful surprise bursts in every bite.  A MUST.  2.  Green noodles with lobster called PICI.  Another fav!!  Has a spice kick to it.  Not stingy with lobster and huge chunky pieces.  A MUST ORDER.  3.  Spaghetti.  Ok.  We got it because it was recommended by yelp reviewers, but wish we got another noodle dish like the spare rib one.  I would skip this one.  The other dishes are far more creative!  4.  Octopus starter.  Amazing!  So tender and did not feel like I was eating octopus.  Tasted and had the consistency of a more expensive sea animal.    5.  Applewood smoked pork chop.  PERFECTLY cooked and you can taste the delicious smokiness.  My brother said it was the best pork chop he's eaten.  Soooo good!!  6.  Side of mushrooms.  Delicious!  Great side!  7.  Scallops.  Our eyes rolled to the back of our heads when we tasted this.  Soooo good!!!  And so tender!    8.  Black cod.  Just melts in your mouth.    9.  Mandarin souffle.  So soft and the cream and ice cream with it was so subtle!  Perfect non heavy dessert to finish it off.  They even put a candle on it for my mom's birthday and wrote happy birthday!  10.  Bread basket (comes with meal).  Dude.  This might be the best bread basket I've ever had.  No joke.  Warm and delicious, it was dangerous because we didn't want to fill up on it but we kept eating.  Guys, if you want to impress your date, recommend a reservation at 6 exactly and get there like 5:45 to get a window seat with a view.  The window seats were all 2 table tops and filled up quick.  We got a booth because we were 5 people.  For groups of like 10, I saw a nice private room with a window view.    Food was amazing, service was impeccable, cannot stress how amazing this place is.  Will definitely come back again to try other dishes!",

We had such a great experience the first time, so when he asked me \"where do you want to go for your birthday dinner?\" I quickly responded.... \"SCARPETTA!\"  When we went for my birthday, it was such a lovely experience.  Our waiter was just amazing! He was so personable, and really made the overall experience pleasant! A great celebration!  For our food, we started with the roasted diver scallops, which just melted in your mouth, we then had the spaghetti, which is undeniably a must try item, the pasta is cooked to perfection and the taste is just simply amazing, after the spaghetti we then had the prime NY strip of beef, the meat was cooked perfectly!  And to top it all off, I had to order the mascarpone cheesecake.... after all- it was my birthday! This cheesecake was absolutely delicious, and topped with a magical mango pineapple compote and passion fruit! SO YUMMY!  This is a restaurant that you must try!    -Ask for a table by the window when making your reservation, there is a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain to enjoy!  (Sorry for the delay in my review/post- my birthday celebration dinner was back in April, and I have recommended this place to many people that I have met and know, and  I figured I finally need to put my great opinion out there to share!)",

We thought it would be a good try because it's really hard to get a good reservation.  We ended up getting fit for a late dinner at 930pm.    Nice romantic place that's dimly lit and if you're lucky you can get a seat next to the window which shows overlooks the bellagio water show.    Service was excellent and the waiter gave us some good recommendations.  The waiter was so great that he even replaced my wife's drink that she didn't like.  We ended up getting the pici, duck and started with the truffled mushrooms.  All the dishes were great and very tasty.  Portion was just right where we got full enough to not get a food coma.    One thing that would've given them the 5th star though would've been if they did something nice for our anniversary like a small cake, etc.  no biggie though.  Definitely recommend coming here for couples!!",

The service was spot on. Attentive and helpful. The sommerlier helped me pick out a unique bottle of Italian red to compliment the meal. We started with the oysters. (Because romance was blooming). And shared the duck and foie gras ravioli and the lamb trio. The ravioli was amazing. Rich and delicious as anything with foie gras should be. The lamb trio is the reason I knocked off a star. Although the dish overall was good, one of the lamb preparations was dry and tough. The plate of complimentary italian cookies at the end was a wonderful touch. Scarpetta will always be meaningful and I plan to be back with my love.",

We were given a bread basket that included stromboli. Yum!  Creamy Polenta: This had mushrooms and truffle oil. The consistency, aroma and taste were superb. I can finish a bowl of this and still want more. 5/5  Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The pasta is shaped like a duck's tongue. It has balsamic reduction on top. If you like foie gras, you'd enjoy this. 4.5/5  Short Rib and Bone Marrow Agnolotti: This and the spaghetti are my favorites on their menu. It's meaty, rich and tasty. It has crunchy bread crumbs so you get that texture. 5/5  Spaghetti: Spaghetti should be real simple. Noodles, olive oil, fresh tomatoes, basil and cheese. Anything extra is plain overdoing it. Cooked perfectly al dente. I get an extra order to-go for lunch the next day - the noodles get softer but soaks up all the flavor. 5/5  Nutella and Vanilla Bomboloni: Italian doughnuts filled with either Nutella or vanilla. Comes with a side of banana gelato. The filling is a little thick - it's not just straight up Nutella.   Amadei Chocolate Cake: Dense chocolate cake with a side of salted caramel gelato. 4/5  Proseco, delicious food, good company and a spectacular view...life is beautiful!",

I love any Italian restaurant that uses handmade pasta. Love the ambiance here as well. I've gone here two nights in a row before to host business meetings because I favor this spot. Delightful that it's right inside one of my favorite hotel casinos, Cosmo.",

    "text": "Wow...yummy!  I had wanted to try out Scarpetta having been a huge Chopped fan and knowing I was going to be staying next-door in the Bellagio. OpenTable didn't have a reservation available for that day and I thought I was out of luck. We happen to be at the Cosmopolitan anyways and went upstairs to do a drop in... luckily they had a table for two with a Fountain view and all!  I can't say enough good things about the breadbasket it was amazing. The caponata I could've eaten 10 bowls.   But I wisely left some room for apps and the main. I had the beet and burrata salad. The dressing on the beets was tangy and the burrata very rich and smooth. It was also beautifully composed. My companion had the polenta. Which was just as sinfully creamy as they said it would be.  For main I had the bone marrow agnolotti. Rich little pillows of beefy heaven. And the breadcrumb crunch on top...perfect. And of course we had to try the famous spaghetti. There's a reason they're famous for it. Sauce clings to the noodles and transports you to Italy...get it.",

    "text": "WOW! What more can you want from a Las Vegas experience. Such a great experience that I actually ate here three times  Amazing service, I mean just stellar, the staff was polite and attentive.   They accommodated a large party of 12 for us in a private room with just an hour notice.   Onto the food:   The mushroom polenta was divine. I had it two nights in a row. Creamy rich yet not too heavy, not overly salted, and a great mushroom to sauce to polenta ratio. Honestly one of the best I've ever side dishes I've ever had.  The pasta... Where can you go wrong here, I tried three of the pastas, squid ink pasta with roe and seaweed was amazing. The combination of the three textures the unctuous earthiness mmmm! A simple pasta with marinara, handmade of course the sauce was buttery sweet lightly salted, and lastly my absolute favorite...   The short rib stuffed pasta. I seriously don't have words to describe this. It had a nice crunchy crumble on top, some fancy reduction drizzled evenly over every piece. Just delicious. Bite sized, al dente, at first I thought the portion was small at first sight but wow it was so filling.  On my next visit I went with a friend:  Apps included the Yellow tail crudo with a unique and delicious infused oil I believe.   The seafood fritto Misto which was good, but I will say it's the only thing I wouldn't get again. Fried lobster, calamari and crab I believe. It was good but too much and with everything else, I didn't want to waste any stomach space.   The Watermelon burrata salad ... Again speechless, I mean did they grow the watermelon here? It was so fresh, juicy, crisp, the tomatoes were clearly hand picked for us lol. It was just so fresh and refreshing a great palette cleanser, and duh burrata makes everything better.   Entree: We split a bone in ribeye. They even chopped it up nicely into two portions, more than enough to share. Medium rare cooked to perfection, I got a photo of this one, you can tell it's high quality, rested well, and extremely juicy.   Paired with a wine, selected by the manager, it was just a great combination. They know their stuff!  No room for dessert.  On my third visit (yes all in one trip)   I came for the black cod, tuna \"susci\" and dessert.   I put this black cod dish up there with Nobu! It was that good. I also felt dumb not realizing it was (sushi) a fun play on words ... (Whoops) another delicious raw appetizer.   The black cod had a caramelized onion fennel tomato topping. Cooked to perfection, flaky, buttery mmmm. I am bias as this is my favorite fish to eat.   Onto dessert: I really really wanted the chocolate banana cake but ... I'm allergic to bananas so that was a no go but everyone around me had ordered it and it was highly recommended.   I went with the Panna cotta, and I'm not typically a huge fan of Panna cotta due to my dislike for the texture, but man they nailed this one as well. Sweet but not toothache sweet. Smooth, dense ish. You gotta try it. Also it has a citrus pineapple caramelized fruit topping I believe. I forgot to get a photo of this one.   Lastly the decor:   The place is dark, classy, upscale, but they have a cool bar, and little private bar tables, great for any occasion honestly. The wine room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, and the main dining room was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up from the round booth.   All in all 5 stars, I'd eat here every day if I could. Many thanks to the staff, barterders, management Etc.   See you next time !!!",

This was awkward and frustrating.  Overall, we were rushed out in under an hour. Dinner was literally waiting for us on the side just as we were done with appetizers. For a restaurant with an extensive wine list, waiter didn't seem knowledgeable about wine and wine was not poured at our table. The Sommelier did not come to our table at any point. Overall, we were made to feel like an inconvenience. As young dinners, we sometimes get a sense of condescension from some staff - this was certainly the case here. We were not there at a busy time, but even if it had been busy we should not have been rushed out. Other tables were being rushed too. Waiter asked several times if were done with our food while I was clearly still eating. Food itself was OK, not great - octopus was very disappointing and lacked flavor. I have had much better elsewhere.  One positive: the windows in the main dinning area provided a beautiful view of the strip and Bellagio fountains!  Certainly, an unfortunate experience at this price point - would not return and would not recommend. Service is everything at this price point, and the iteration of Scarpettta misses the mark.",

Based on this dish I really want to come in for dinner some time soon. Perfectly seasoned and the texture was heavenly.    The cocktails were great, too.

The strongest recommendations were the following and the yelpers were right on: Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - pretty amazing Black Farfalle - bowtie pasta with lobster was delicous - the texture of this pasta felt like someone may have actually tied it in a bow  The spaghetti was good but serves more as a filler and does not stand out next to the other dishes.  I had the sea bass (branzino) for my main dish which was also good but again, on this night, it was all about the pasta.",

This is my 7th time here and I always try something new. This time it was the pasta with octopus and bone marrow,  topped with very delicious bread crumbs! The name of the dish was Gargnelli or something like that, regardless it was exquisite! My friend and I shared the polenta, because even if you come here 100 times you MUST have the polenta with fricasse mushrooms!  That is in my top 5 list for sure, but tonight something was not spot on I must admit, but I still enjoyed it. If you like cocktails the San Remo is the bomb. I have learned to make them at home because I enjoy so much! Luis our server deserves a huge shout out because he was wonderful.  This is another fabulous part of Scarpetta HOSPITALITY is A+++ all other places should send their staff here to learn from the best! I sincerely enjoy this restaurant and have turned many others on to it and they would agree :-)",

We started out with cocktails & enjoyed the variety of complimentary bread served with citrus olive oil, eggplant caponata & mascarpone butter. We chose the lardo wrapped prawns as our appetizer which were served with rosemary lentils & it was very flavorful. I had the black tagliolini pasta for my entree which was lightly dressed with a cream sauce & topped with dungeness crab, uni & tobiko. I told the server's assistant who removed my empty dish that, had I been alone, I would have licked the plate...it was that good. I lived in Italy for several months & had some great pasta, but never anything that spectacular. My date had the lamb trio which was filet, sausage & chop over ceci beans & baby carrots topped with hazelnut. He requested the chop cooked medium rare but it was served rare. The server quickly took it back for a re-fire & it was perfectly cooked upon its return. We enjoyed the nutella & vanilla bomboloni for dessert which was served with chocolate shortbread crumble & banana gelato. The only issue I had was that our server was a little aloof & cold, but it was late & I believe we were his last table so I understand. It really did nothing to detract from my fantastic experience at Scarpetta & his assistant, guy with a beard & long hair (cute!), made up for it with his kind conversation. Can't wait to return for another meal here!",

First the positive.  The food was excellent.  All 6 of us in the party loved our food.  The desserts also were fabulous.   No complaint at all there.  The problem was the service.  The server was very friendly, but too many issues.  First, we got our cocktails, and after a few minutes, he took our order.  We did not order first courses, however our order was out virtually instantly.  We hadn't even half finished our drinks.  We had planned to order a couple of bottles of wine with dinner, however we never got the chance, and more importantly, our server never asked.  Worse yet, he came by a bit after we got our food,and while walking asked if everything was okay.  We said that it was, and before we could even asked for more drinks, he was gone.  2 of the 6 drinks at the table were totally empty, and he never asked, and still worse, he NEVER CAME BACK.  Our drinks sat empty for 75% of the dinner, and even when he ordered dessert, he did not ask if we wanted coffee or anything else to drink!!!!  It was almost unbelievable.  It's not like he was that busy, as I had a clear view of the waiter station, and he spent quite a bit of time just standing there, watching the dining room.  Obviously not our table, however.  Unless I start to hear some very positive reviews from friends, we will not be back.",

We are both big fans of eating out so we were very excited to come here. Our waiter was very attentive and we did not feel like we had to get his attention to order or get our check. One of the things I love about dining here is that they have one of the most extensive and delicious bread baskets ever (4 types of bread and 3 spread/dips).   As for the food and drinks, we ordered a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc which was reasonably priced compared to their cocktail prices. We shared the polenta to start, which the restaurant kindly split between 2 bowls for us, which was a very nice gesture. For our entrees we shared the short rib agnolotti and the black fettuccini. Both dishes were delicious. However, the short rib agnolotti was clearly the stand out and probably my favorite dish here. On a past visit, I have also ordered their spaghetti which sounds plain but is super flavorful.   We were pretty full and did not order dessert, but based on a prior visit, I highly recommend the bomboloni.",

After eating at the Vegas location the first time, we were so impressed and loved the food so much we chose it for the location of our rehearsal dinner.     We had our wedding rehearsal dinner for 32 people at scarpetta in the Vino room on 6/15.  I'm so happy we did.  Everything was absolute perfection.  I have to give a shout out to the staff at Scarpetta especially Kelly Racine for all of her help.  She was fantastic throughout this process.     We had a menu that consisted of the following  Braised Short ribs (Very good) Creamy Pollenta (to die for) Heirloom tomato salad  spaghetti (in no way over rated) Short Rib Agnolotti (spectacular in every way)  Black Cod (did not have this for my entree, but it got good reviews) Sirloin with gnocchi & wild mushrooms (delish!)  we also had two different desserts served to our table that were outstanding.   The waitstaff was fantastic, very polite and moved around the room seamlessly.   I can not wait to return for another meal.   And if you're looking for a place to have a small wedding reception or rehearsal dinner, I highly recommend adding Scarpetta to your list of restaurants to check out.",

Highlights: - roasted diver scallops - wonderful, beautifully seared and nicely complemented by the peas - bread basket - quite the variety and served with an eggplant tapenade - agnolotti - unctuous and decadent tasting little pillows  - fennel dusted cod - elegant flavors and well cooked - desserts - hazelnut cake with poached pears and a decadent chocolate almond cake  Could improve: - artic char was overdone - spaghetti was done well, al dente and with just the right amount of tomato basil...but way overpriced - wine list was clearly very very marked up    Overall, very enjoyable meal and a welcome reprieve from the LV scene.",

It's so chic and luxe, you can't help but feel sophisticated while there. Scarpetta itself is also very, very nice. My co-worker and I were seated by the window with an amazing view of the Bellagio water show. Fabulous! But more importantly, the food was delicious! Everything from the cocktails to the bread basket was wonderful. We ordered the berry smash cocktails (perfect and not too sweet!), scallops, heirloom tomato salad, spaghetti (simple yet amazing), short rib ravioli and the best dessert on the planet, the cinnamon sugar donuts with warm nutella in the middle and caramelized bananas on the side (are they for real?!?).   Bottom line, if you're in town you MUST go to Scarpetta. You won't regret it!",

We sat next to the window, so we got a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I'm still dreaming of the Black Tagliolini. Order it! It's the perfect balance of salty sea, cream, and butter. It was well balanced, not overly sauced and the tobiko added a nice texture. They are famous for the Spaghetti and it didn't disappoint. The noodles were al dente and the sauce was complex. You could taste the time and care that was put into it. The Amedei Chocolate Cake was a surprise hit. There was a rich chocolate ganache inside and a coco powder dusting outside, which went perfectly with the almond gelato. It reminded me of a well-made truffle. The next time I'm in Vegas I will make sure to visit Scarpetta again.",

    "text": "Scarpetta, located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, has roughly the same menu as its New York counterpart, including the famous Spaghetti with butter - er, basil - and you can expect the same eyebrow-raising prices.  But it's delicious and, besides, you're in Vegas so you clearly already hate money.  The atmosphere was relaxed, upscale and quiet, which may or may not be what you're looking for in a Vegas dinner.  The service is a bit of a different story.  On the one hand, there were periods when we couldn't get anyone's attention for minutes at a time.  On the other hand, our server was overattentive whenever he was at our table.  For instance, when we were ordering, after we placed our order he would offer commentary on each dish.  This might just be a pet peeve of mine, but if I've already decided on a dish, I don't need you to tell me that it \"appears small on the plate, but the filling and the reduction are actually quite rich, so I think you'll be satisfied.\"  Just say \"OK\" or nothing at all.  To start I ordered the yellowtail, which was incredible and I only wish there was more of it.  The sea salt was a really nice touch and I'm probably now going to be tempted to salt all of my sashimi going forward.  For my main, I had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was similarly delicious (and enough food, I thought). According to our server, most people order three courses, but my group felt like two was enough.",

The lentils were amazing and the squid perfectly cooked.    For dinner I had the \"Pici\" (pasta) served with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto.  It was perfectly portioned but still a little \"heavy\".  I paired that with a side order of broccoli rabe and a nice house Chianti.  No dessert for our group.

The concierge at the Cosmopolitan hotel was about as nice and as accommodating as you could hope to have and she hooked me and my smoking hot date up. The place looks amazing and i dont now who they thought we were but we got the million dollar table. It must have been that new Calvin Klein dress i was wearing that made them think i was deserving of a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I even asked my hot date if he tipped for that table, he swore he didn't. Whatever I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth i just enjoyed the amazing beautiful view and got ready to eat.   The service... Impeccable. Charming on the ball waiter with not too much sass but just enough chit chat. The food was prompt and delicious. I had the creamy truffle polenta and  super yummy black macaroni with lobster and Mr handsome across the table from me had the goat which was really good too. I know because even though i dont eat goat cuz i think its gross, he made me taste it and it was.. well, really good. And that's from a goat hater! The wine list is deep but not over complicated, even a wine Jr leauger like myself could find my way around it.  It was a real romantic fairytale night out, exactly what you think fine dinning should be. It was fancy with out being stuck up, tasty with out being weird. Scarpetta LV is a real winner.",

We were able to get a good reservation on a short notice, and were seated near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountain so that was a nice touch.  Server was extremely knowlegable and even shared some additional knowledge he had about the Sommelier. Turns out he is one of four master sommelier's in Las Vegas, and has his own vineyard. Nice guy to chat with.  Now the food... We started with the Yellowtail, moved on to the Black Farfalle, and ended with the Aged Sirloin. Yellowtail was awesome, though could have been sliced a little thicker. If you have never had Black Farfalle, I suggest getting it here. The server mentioned it would have a shelfish taste, but I didn't find it to be overwhelming, instead a nice balance. The Aged Sirloin came with perfectly prepared Gnocchi, which is a hard task seemingly for many chefs to pull off. But they did tonight! The Barolo Ragu was a perfect addition to bring the dish altogether.  The only thing I would say is the wine list was a tad overpriced in comparison to what I would expect from retail / dining out. So that is what made the 4th star come out.   Definitely a great dining experience.",

I guess their specialty is the Stromboli that is included in the bread basket.  Meh.  And the rest of the dinner was pretty forgettable also.

I loved the venue, on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, mid dark light very elegant, though it is a bit more crowded due to the small space, but the bar area is very cute.  We got 4 diff appetizers, beet salad, pork belly, scallops and Beef I liked them all  Then 4 entrees: black cod, foie gras ravioli, diff meats ravioli and i forgot the last one! but again it was delicious, the black cod melts in your mouth!  Different we got an apple pie sort with ice cream and raspberries.  Def coming out here again next time  invegas. Cosmo is just beautiful and elegant hotel very modern, but trying STK next time",

    "text": "This is my first ever check-in on Yelp!  I had a great dining experience at Scarpetta. The food was beyond delicious. The service was terrific and the view was breathtaking. We sat right next to the window so we got to watch the Bellagio water ballet as we munched on our perfectly cooked pasta and veal medallions.   We ordered the braised short ribs with farro and the tuna rolls as our starters. The tuna rolls were not impressive but the quality of the tuna was great. The braised short ribs with farro was so good I could've eaten bowls and bowls of it. The beef was flavorful and tender and the farro was cooked to perfection. I wish we ordered another plate of the short ribs because I loved it. I ordered the famous spaghetti and it was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The pasta was so fresh, soft and chewy. It was simple but done perfectly. My friends ordered the tortellini with duck and foie gras, veal medallions and fresh pasta sheets with lobster, garlic and pistachios. Everything was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the napoleon with creme brulee and blood orange sorbet.   Our server was attentive and not pushy. He also had a great sense of humor.    It was a great experience over and I would recommend you stop by this place when you're in Vegas.",

    "text": "Four of us had dinner here 2 weeks ago--much anticipation given the Chef behind the restaurant!  Host staff was very pleasant--we were seated immediately at our table which had a decent view of the water-show at neighboring Bellagio.  The adult beverages were VERY good, and wait staff was excellent and well-informed about the menu.  One of our party was newly enamored of a drink she had previously had at the Chandelier bar at this same hotel--they did not have this drink at Scarpetta--but our waiter discussed it with the bartender and they came up with an excellent version of the cocktail--which may have surpassed the original!  I agree with the prior comments about the bread basket--the bread with the salami was the best thing we ate all night.  We ordered many things off of the menu--from the basic spaghetti to the seafood pasta--all of it was served very quickly and at proper temperature, etc, and presentation was great.   The pasta portion of the seafood pasta was overdone, but the rest of the meals were very good (though nothing I would say we had to go back for, except that bread!).  Desert was basic and boring--nothing exciting.  Overall the ambience was great--excellent place for date night, drinks, and decent food.",

First the service here is impeccable, the staff is on point and very knowledgeable of the menu. The atmosphere is amazing, very romantic for dates and great views on the Bellagio fountains. Now to the food... got the beef tar tar, squid and baby octopus and heir loom tomato salad to start; all were delicious, the beef tar tar was amazing with the egg yoke Mmmmm getting hungry writing this review. The heir loom tomato salad with baratta cheese oh my goodness, the flavors accentuate each other complimenting one another without overpowering one another. The squid and baby octopus was so flavorful, cooked to perfection; not chewy very tender. Now to the main course which is a big part of why my rating was so low, got the duck foie gras ravioli and the Fettuccine with lamb ragu and broccoli rab. I don't know what went wrong but my ravioli with the foie gras was so over whelming that it was hard to finish the plate, needs something to balance out the flavors. the pasta itself had no flavor (probably not salted) now to the fettuccine with lamb, which was well just fettuccine with lamb nothing special, not much flavor either and nothing special. Maybe its the location the waiter said scott doesn't come here often so maybe he needs to swing by and check up on this place but overall not impressed and ill stick to eating at the one in beverly hills",

The ambiance was quiet and intimate. It's perfect for a romantic dinner and conversation. I came here few times and never had anything I didn't like. Scarpetta serves very tasty breads. Don't fill yourself up with those yummies before your real food arrives! All pasta noodles here are hand made fresh. Lobster Pici( thick, hand-rolled pasta) is my love on pasta menu. It comes with big chunks of lobster and very tasty spiced sauce. I also really enjoy Spiced Duck Breast, Mediterranean Branzino and Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli from entree menu. One more thing you have to remember! Save some space for deserts! COCONUT PANNA COTTA is a MUST ORDER. It's very light and refreshing. It's a perfect way to end your dinner. I totally fall in love with Scarpetta as soon as I discovered this gem on strip. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do.",

A little confused, we waited to see if we were in the right place. Along came a waiter to assist. He sat us by the windows. We got lucky.  We saw the amazing Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes. It was pretty cool.  Dinner was good but pricey. I ordered 1/2 dozen of oysters to start and it was delis.  The homemade cocktail sauce was so perfect.  For my entree, I ordered the tagliatelle and it was okay. The first few bites were good but got heavy after a while, that and i'm not a fan of peas and carrots with my pasta.  My husband ordered the prime filet of beef with  potato-lardo puree, rainbow chard & barolo sauce.  He loved it. The rainbow chard and barolo sauce was probably the best thing on the dish. We spent about $140 on dinner. i wasn't that impressed for the price but still good overall.   The view makes up for it. I'm a big fan of the Bellagio fountains and it never gets old.",

    "text": "I highly recommend this place. I ate here last night with a group of three others, the entire experience was wonderful. The restauraunt is beautiful and has a great view overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. I started with the wine list. I had read one review on yelp from a reviewer complaining there were hardly any bottles of wine under 100.00, I thought the wine menu was really varied and there were many price points to choose from, types, regions. This is a fine dining restauraunt so what do you expect. I chose a Riesling from France that was perfect with our food.   The bread, holy Jesus the bread. They have about four different kinds they bring out (and keep bringing). There is a roll with salami inside that is literally to die for. The bread is accompanied by mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and some sun dried tomatoe compote. All wonderful. We started with oysters that were fresh and perfect.   I ordered the Black fettuccine with seafood (crab, shrimp, squid) and it was incredible. This is a dish with few ingredients for a reason, fresh seafood and house made pasta really don't need many other players. I forced my boyfriend to order the special, a lamb ragu over fettuccine after we argued for five minutes (I won). This was the best ragu I have ever eaten, hands down. Incredible, we inhaled it. The portions are really good, it looks small when they present your plate but there is a lot of pasta I could hardly finish mine.   For desert, you have to try the strawberry soufle, it literally melts in your mouth. We also had these little light donuts filled with with banan creme and Nutella. Enough said.   The waitstaff was wonderful, very warm and attentive. Our waiter was fantastic, everyone was.   You have to make a reservation ahead for this place, we landed in Vegas on a Wednesday and the cosmopolitan concierge had to squeeze is in.",

    "text": "Our server started us out with an array of different breads, accompanied by mascarpone butter, an eggplant tomato caponata & citrus olive oil. I often tend to judge a meal as soon as the bread (or chips... etc) arrives to the table. First impressions are crucial! If you ever dine at Scarpetta, dig for the warm stromboli loaf in your bread basket first! It pairs really wonderfully with the caponata, but also stands strong on its own. You definitely want to eat this bread while its hot- because its stuffed with layers of salami & mozzarella. YUM!  My first course was Braised Short Ribs of Beef over a farro risotto. The beef was immensely tender & alive with flavor. It had a very thin slice of parmesan resting on top of it, just barely melted. Nice touch! I loved how hearty the risotto was- this is nothing my Mom would have ever prepared for me...but somehow the risotto tasted home-y. I didn't even have time to identify all the vegetables that were in this dish, because I was far too busy stuffing my face. Between bites of the short ribs, I had a few pieces of raw yellowtail. Incredibly fresh, with such great flavor. Unknown to me at the time, it was adorn with almost microscopic red onions (GROSS)...but I ate each piece very willingly- despite my hatred for onions.  For my main course I had the Aged Sirloin of Beef. It was served with wild mushrooms, potato gnocchi & barolo ragu. Everything on the plate was exceedingly juicy & robust, without being overwhelming. The gnocchi was a great equalizer to the sirloin and the ragu. This dish was really unforgettable, hats off to Scott Conant.  Dessert was very simple! Coconut Panna Cotta served with coconut sorbetto, pineapples & guava soup, ofcourse this is my pick- being a True Hawaiian & all. I could have done without the crushed pineapples, I felt like they interfered with the guava coconut vibe I had going. I had mentally prepared myself for the guava soup to be too sweet, but fortunately, I was incorrect. In addition to that, I was thrilled with how smooth the panna cotta was. Each bite was like silk!  In short, I LOVED Scarpetta. 4 stars!",

We were wowed by the wine selection, albeit pricey, and the initial offering of bread and accoutrements laid the groundwork for an amazing dinner. First course consisted of the braised short rib risotto which was so incredibly tender and rich. I also ordered the beef tartare and quail egg which was top notch but came with no surprises. My wife went with the famous spaghetti for her entree and let me tell you, it blows the doors off Gordon Ramsey's beef Wellington (and it's only a few simple ingredients and fresh pasta!). I ordered the lamb with grain mustard and kale which was expertly cooked and delicious. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the watermelon parfait. I'm not a fruit dessert kind of guy so the parfait didn't appeal to me much but my wife loved it. It did seem rather refreshing. My chocolate cake was insanely rich and delicious but made me wish I had a glass of milk to go with it, haha. All things considered it was my favorite dinner during our trip to Vegas (among visits to Gordon Ramsey's 'Steak', Wolfgang Puck's 'Spago' and a handful of buffets). We will absolutely be going back. Love you Scott Conant!",

    "text": "La pasta perfetto!  Sometimes the simplest things can be magical when executed perfectly.  This is the case with Scarpetta, Scott Conant's debut into the Las Vegas restaurant scene.    The decor is understated and classy, in shades of black, white and gray.  A knowledgable and unpretentious waitstaff makes the experience all that much better, as they walk you through the menu.  A few tables along the wall rest next to big windows which overlook the neon shimmer of the strip below.  If you're coming here with a small group, definitley request one of these tables.    Adesso, il Cibo  (Now, the food)  Yellowtail Carpaccio -  Four paper-thin slices of yellowtail treated with fine olive oil and a bit of garlic.  High quality fish and a gentle hand made this appetizer balanced and elegant.  Waygu Beef Tartare - Diced  Waygu beef treated in a similar fashion to the yellowtail, but with a more pronounced garlic note at the end.  Very straightforward and satisfying.  Spaghetti Marinara - As many have said, this is the best spaghetti you will ever eat.  The housemade Al Dente spaghetti is toothsome and tender.  Somehow, the chefs here are able to pull the purest essence of tomato and basil out in this dish.  The simultaneous subtley and complexity of the flavor profile here is truly incredible.  I've spent a lot of time in Italy, and honestly cannot think of a spaghetti that holds a candle to this masterpiece.  A must order!  Black Mac n' Lobster - I believe the black color of the noodles comes from squid ink, but I could be mistaken.  Very nice flavors of lobster and the sea.  The texture was quite similar to the spaghetti, which I found to be redundant, but that was an error in my ordering, and nothing to do with the execution of the dish.    Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli w/ Marsala Reduction - The food that kings eat!  The ravioli was immaculate, formed with care and the love you'd expect from a homemade Italian meal.  I found the combination of duck, foie gras, and the marsala reduction to be a bit too heavy.  I could see people raving about this dish, but for me it was just too much of a good thing.  Branzino - Gentle white fish with a lightly crisped skin and honest flavors.  One of the best cooked fish plates I can remember having.  Dry Aged Filet - The pink/gray color of this steak is visually contradictory to what you might find at a fine steak house, but that is due to the dry aging process.  It was tender, flavorful, and neat.  Yes the bread is incredible as well, but let's not fill up on bread.  Scarpetta is a great date spot if you're looking to splurge.  Do not leave without ordering the spaghetti, its the type of dish you'll tell your grandkids about.",

Atmosphere:  I went with 3 girlfriends and I think the atmosphere was a little bit more subdued than we were hoping. It was a Thursday night, the restaurant was 1/2 empty and was very quiet/tame. We are used to the NYC dining scene, where top restaurants are packed and noisy and give an atmosphere of fun, which is more what we were expecting.   Food: -Bread was absolutely delicious! we ate two baskets :)  -duck Foi gras ravioli: very good, but was a bit too al dente for my taste  -steak: understanding this is not a steak restaurant, the steak was not flavorful at all. I would at least expect the steak to have some pizazz.  -wine list: very extensive and reasonable range of prices to accommodate.   Service:  - it was good. nothing exceptional. the best service I have ever received is from a Tom Colicchio restaurant - I wish all high end places would follow suit!    I would probably come back here to give it a second chance, but I am in no rush.",

    "text": "Pretty phenomenal place. Let me start with the drinks. Most were on the fruity side, but they were all delicious. The main room has a window view of the Bellagio fountains, which set the mood and were going off every 15-20 minutes or so. Food was pretty good for the most part. Lady had the prix fixe and I had a few a la carte choices. The tuna app was super fresh and perfect for the evening. The celeriac soup was silky and very good. The bread is awesome. I know it sounds weird to rate the free shit, but their \"stromboli\" bread with the marscapone butter could be a meal in itself. Pumpkin ravioli was great. The filet and short rib mash was on point. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the foie/duck ravioli. It just wasn't what I thought it would be . It was good, and a rather large portion, but I expected something else. Dessert was ho-hum as well. Regardless, I would come back as the service was great and the ambiance was great.",

As far as the meals go, my date ordered the The Creamy Polenta as her appetizer and she seemed to enjoy it.   I opted for the Short Rib Agnolotti as my main dish and the pasta was LOADED with raw minced horseradish which flat out overpowered the whole dish with almost every bite. And I LOVE spicy food, but it would took my breath away with almost every bite, so it was far too much for my liking. You would have to absolutely LOVE horseradish to even enjoy this dish.   My date ordered The Risotto with vegetables from the Vegetarian menu which was just mixed diced vegetables. The dish came out at room temperature and did not taste good at all, so the order was sent back.  I will not be returning to Scarpetta, nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I know.",

    "text": "This is one of those restaurants that just inspires you. You know, like how it inspired me to open a Yelp account just so I could tell everyone what a terrible experience I had. I've skimmed over a lot of positive reviews on here, so I'm kind of shocked by how crappy our experience was.  It earns one star for the solid cocktails (I had a Moscow Mule) and the delicious bread basket.   The service started out mediocre. We (me and two of my girlfriends) had an 8:30 p.m. reservation and arrived on time, but were still told to wait in the bar for 15 minutes despite seeing open tables. No biggie, we order drinks and hang out.   We're seated at 8:45 p.m., the waiter greets us, he's surly and disinterested. Who cares, the bread basket has just arrived and is delicious. The bus boy seems friendly and smiles. Everything is cool. Waiter asks if we want sparkling or still water. I say still instead of saying tap, and we get the $8 bottle. Ok, so it was a little sneaky but it's my mistake for not knowing to say tap. But no big deal, still eating the bread.  8:55 - We order 12 oysters, wine, and our main dishes because we've already decided. One of the girls mispronounces her dish, and he gives her a look like she just asked which side Italy was on in WWII. He corrects her, she politely apologizes, and he tells her \"it's OK,\" even though clearly it is not.  9:00 p.m. - The oysters arrive. There are 6 instead of 12 and a bus boy brings them out. We get no description and none was offered on the menu. We plan to inform the waiter about our missing oysters when he comes by again, but I guess he's done with us because he's vanished and does not reappear until we are well into the main course (which is really only 10 minutes later). No matter, we will not be needing any additional oysters as the first 6 were disgusting. Half are covered in red wine vinegar, it's unclear if there is actually an oyster in the shell as I can't taste it. The remaining three have three large chunks of ice carefully placed on top of each oyster, indicating the ice is part of the dish. The problem with having a huge chunk of ice in an oyster is that it makes you chew your oyster multiple times until you realize you are chewing an oyster.  9:05ish p.m. - The main dishes come out. I ordered the short rib agnolotti and my friend had the duck & foie gras ravioli. The descriptions sounded better than the food tasted. The ravioli was overcooked. I can't remember what my other friend ordered as I didn't try it when she said it was also mediocre.  9:15 p.m. - Our waiter materializes temporarily to clear our dishes and to fail to comment on the fact that we've left a substantial portion of our food uneaten. I receive the glass of wine I ordered with the appetizers.  9:20 p.m. - Waiter asks if we want dessert, no thanks, and he drops off the bill immediately. Now he's all smiles.  9:25 p.m. - They take a chair from our table to put together a table for an incoming party of 10, even though there are many empty tables with chairs surrounding us. We take that as our cue, throw back our wine and leave.  The result - we ended up paying over $200 for 45 minutes of so-so food and bad service. I've had worse service before, but never at a place that had the audacity to charge me this much. We also stayed in the Cosmo during our stay and the service at the hotel was pretty lackluster.",

If this food appeals to you and you have the budget I would highly rec for a special occasion.

I tried the crab and corn soup - delicious as was the chocolate cake I ate. however the show stoppers were the duck and bone marrow pasta dishes - DEVINE.

    "text": "My favorite thing about Vegas is not the casinos, shows, or nightclubs (although the latter is a close second), but the abundance and quality of fine dining.  One of my girl friends requested that we dine at The Cosmopolitan on our Vegas getaway, so I picked Scarpetta because it was spendy but not quite a splurge like e by Jose Andres or Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.  As far as Italian food goes, Scarpetta was scrumptious, though overpriced like everything on the Strip.  My girl friends and I were seated at a big, chic horseshoe booth--and if it weren't for our next destination (dancing at Tryst and XS), I likely would've drank and ate more here.   For my appetizer I had the spring pea soup ($16) with gulf shrimp, guanciale (Italian bacon), and reisling gelee.  It was the most delicious pea soup I've ever had in my life! Incredibly balanced, fresh, flavorful, and masterfully presented.    For my main I had the duck & foie gras ravioli ($26) with marsala reduction.  I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras, let alone the duck.  I did appreciate, however, that the pasta was homemade.  Crystal L.'s main course, the short rib agnolotti ($25), with brown butter horseradish and toasted breadcrumb was a much better choice for pasta--I was so happy when she literally gave me half!  I knew then and there that this was going to be a wonderful night!  If you like classic trattoria fare, I wouldn't go to Scarpetta.  But if you don't mind fancy, modern Italian, look no further.",

    "text": "Scarpetta is an excellent restaurant, but it is also extremely overpriced. The portion sizes are very small and the prices are ridiculous.  I started my meal off with the roasted diver scallops. These are served with sunchokes, pinenuts, gremolata and mushrooms. Awesome appetizer...fresh and delicious.  For my main course, I ordered perigord black truffle tagliatelle. This truffle was definitely amazing, I was just disappointed in the quantity. They put literally three small shavings in my dish of plain pasta (no vegetables...nothing) and this cost $65. I understand that 1 oz of these truffles is $60-100, but at the same time they could have at least put 5 or 6 shavings. I thought this was a total rip-off. I mean this is black truffle, NOT even white truffle! I have been to other high-end restaurants where I pay the same price and they will literally shave a whole truffle into my pasta. Next time, I will boil my own plain pasta at home and order these truffles online. The cost will be the same but at least I will be getting what I pay for...VALUE!!  For dessert, I ended my meal with the amedei chocolate cake served with gelato and salted caramel sauce. Rich and luscious dessert to finish off the night.                                I recommend checking out Scarpetta for dinner, just avoid ordering the black and white truffles and be sure to bring a full wallet!",

    "text": "Wow! I was not expecting to love Scarpetta as much as I did. After a rather disappointing dining experience at Mastro's steakhouse the night before, I needed some Italian comfort food! From the moment we walked in I was in love. I love the lighting and the cozy booths next to the bar looked very inviting and I was hoping we would be sat at one. Thank god we weren't! Instead we were lead into the main dining room which has a perfect view of the Bellagio and Bellagio fountains! We not only had an amazing dinner but also enjoyed the fountain show every 1/2 hour.   Now on to the actual meal. First of all, the bread selection in the basket are delicious! There was a prosciutto and mozzarella roll that was just to die for! For an appetizer we went with the heirloom tomato salad. Yummy! Next up we shared one of the pasta dishes that was on special. I can't remember what it was called, which is unfortunate because it was outstanding. Next we shared the roasted chicken, also very good! We shared a side of the carrots which were great. The combination of honey and the crunch of the nuts made the cooked carrots really stand out.   Besides the meal itself, the service was outstanding. Since we shared each plate our server made sure that the items were split onto two plates so that we didn't have to reach across the table to get bites of food. Our water glasses never went below half full and our server was very attentive.   I will definitely visit Scarpetta on my future visits to Vegas.",

    "text": "My friend had tried the Scarpetta in LA and had raved about it, so when she came to town we had to try the one at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. She was absolutely right (she usually is ;) and I have been back several times since first trying it with her.   The restaurant is beautifully done .. very contemporary and chic .. and most every seat boasts a fabulous view of the Bellagio Fountain show. It's a great place for entertaining out-of-town guests for sure. One time we even had the privilege of being seated at the \"Chefs\" Table (which is in a private room) with a prime view of the Fountain Show and the entire kitchen.   The food .. what can I say .. everything we've tried there is spectacular! My favorites are the Short Rib Agnolotti, which is simply melt-in-your mouth goodness and the Tagliatelle with Fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale, which is just the right amount of truffle and is nice and light. I've also tried that famous Spaghetti .. it's good, very good, but not something that I would order again. Some of my dining partners have tried the Lobster Pasta, the Black Cod and the Duck Breast and the little bites I tried were good, but not necessarily items I would order.   From the starters, my favorites are the Creamy Polenta, again with Truffle :) and the Braised Short Ribs of Beef. The Calamari and the Scallops are also good, but we keep going back to the Polenta.   Dessert .. the most important part of the meal .. the second time we were there, we saw something at another table that looked delicious and right up our alley .. turns out it was not on their menu but from the neighboring Scott Conant eatery DOCG Enoteca. It's called the Salted Caramel Budino with Pretzel Toffee.  It is super creamy and  the perfect balance of both sweet and salty at the same time. We shared it the first go-around but now order one each whenever we go .. and that rarely happens.   The service is impeccable, friendly knowledgeable servers and bussers who go the extra mile and have great personalities. The first time we were there my dining partner mentioned she was heading to DC the following weekend and our server came back with a list of fun things / places for her to do while she was there.",

We had no room and were too close to the next couple so I decided we should just go to Scarpetta instead. The decor is absolutely beautiful! We sat at a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains and it was stunning. So far happy with my decision.   We had the short ribs and the tuna susci appetizer. The short ribs were good but nothing about them stood out as amazing. The risotto that came with them was just ok. The tuna appetizer was out of this world. The marinated veggies that came with were just so delicious and they went so well with the thinly sliced tuna.   For our entrees, my husband had the NY strip and I had the Orata. The steak was seasoned perfectly and it was very good. The Orata was somewhat different from what I expected. It is a very light dish so if you are watching your waistline, I would recommend it. The fish was cooked well and wasn't dry at all, just lacking some seasoning in my opinion. The tomato based broth was also a little bland but overall it was a good dish. We also ordered the glazed carrots to go along with our meal. OMG, I couldn't stop eating these even after I was full. They were so good!!   Overall a great dining experience. I would like to go back and try some pasta next time. I also thought the service was excellent and the staff was very welcoming.",

Portions not comparable with the prices but could have been overlooked had our waiter been more professional and customer service oriented.   Management really should choose their employees more carefully, and that would include front of the house.  As for the window seating....where to begin. It really needs to be stated that even though there is window seating with view of the strip, there is a very large horizontal beam (which happens to be at eye level when seated) that obstructs your view. Restaurant should have made design considerations with regard to seating and tables to accommodate for that beam.   Better places -hands down- in Vegas to spend a little less of my hard earned money and receive a better meal and better service!",

Do not miss on that menu - short rib bone marrow agnolotti and the duck and foie ravioli - literally \"last meal\" worthy.  Also, the pork belly was amazing.  The $7.00/glass Sangiovese was surprisingly great (we ususally don't opt for happy hour wines).  We also ordered The Spaghetti with added meatballs from the regular dinner menu.  It was the best spaghetti we have ever had.  Dessert was the incredible mascarpone cheesecake with a perfect double espresso.  We luxuriated in one of the curved booths close to the entrance which was private but let you observe the comings and goings of the restaurant.  The decor, music, ambiance, etc. is first rate.  Last, but not least, the service was superb.  Friendly, efficient and professional.  This was a True 5/5 dining experience and we will definitely be back",

Service is good and its a very nice setting.  Would come back....many times!",

In fact, I actually returned the first batch. It was watery and the noodles were overcooked and broken. The second batch was only slightly better but definitely not the same in flavor, texture and consistency that I experienced in Miami and again in Vegas last fall.  It's still excellent service and probably the prettiest and fanciest restaurant at the Cosmo. They will always hold that title.",

Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: Delicious, but too decadent for my taste. They give you a huge portion, too, about 3 times the amount I actually was expecting, even for an entree. Filling, with a good salty bite. Finishing this was the death of me, but a very enjoyable self-indulgent death.  Spaghetti: I love when simple, basic dishes are just beautifully executed. This was just the perfect spaghetti. I would be perfectly okay walking into a restaurant like this and ordering it. It is divine.  Mediterranean Branzino: Seafood party in my mouth. Branzino had a nice caramelized crust and the medley of vegetables and shrimp/clams/etc paired really well with the light broth.  Aged Sirloin of Beef: cooked to bloody medium-rare excellence. Enjoyed the salty/nutty bite of Parmagiano.  As for cocktails, I can recommend the Gimlet and the Gallardo.",

    "text": "Scarpetta is a lovely italian restaurant inside The Cosmopolitan. We were seated near the entrance but still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains which became more spectacular as it grew darker outside. They had a nice assortment of bread to start along with a healthy list of specials that included diver scallops and foie gras, which my husband ordered. I started with the white corn soup with Dungeness crab which was sweet, buttery and one of the best soups I've ever tasted. For my main course, I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli. My dish might have been better if I didn't try my husband's dish which had actual pieces of seared foie gras. Holy duck liver, Batman! With my dish, I thought that combining the duck and the liver in the ravioli just muddied the flavors of both food items that I found so enjoyable. We finished the meal off with coffee and shared a delightfully light mascarpone cheesecake.  The prices are a bit high, as expected from a fine dining establishment on the Strip, yet not prohibitive. The service was spot on, warm and unobtrusive. Let the waitstaff know if you are vegetarian or on a gluten-free diet and they will provide you a separate menu.",

    "text": "I have dreamt about eating the spaghetti here for years. For years. And when that spaghetti and I finally met and dined together, it did not disappoint. The spaghetti noodles are cooked to an al dente. Rather than the spaghetti sauce poured on top, the noodles are simmered and cooked with simple sauce. The starch from the noodles holds onto the flavors bringing together the noodles and sauce. The spaghetti here is divine.  In addition to the spaghetti, our table also shared the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms, the braised short ribs of beef, and the raw yellowtail. All of which were equally as good.  The service was subpar. Our table had to constantly flag our waiter down. For a fine dining establishment, I felt like we were jipped. On top of the inattentiveness, my friend encountered a shard of plastic/glass in her salad. Lemme tell you, whatever she bit into was hard. HARD. Everyone at the table felt it and indeed, the shard was tough and hard. We sent the dish back to the kitchen and the chef simply said that we were mistaken and that shard was actually just a piece of hard sea salt....uh. Okay. Clearly that piece of salt sea did not melt in my friend's mouth and it was HARD. Sea salt my ass.  The food is good, but go to the one in Beverly Hills. This place sucks. And maybe they cater toward out of towners who don't know any better, but for the vast majority- we know what fine dining should look and feel like and this certainly is not it.",

Pasta we got:  Pici- it was very interesting, tasted almost like black licorice. I wouldn't get it again.  Spaghetti with red sauce and basil- was super plain needed more basil and some fresh parmesan or something.... I wouldn't get Again really such a simple blah dish. Not sure why everyone is in awe of this dish   Tagliolini- if you want to taste the garbage of the ocean get this dish, it was so terrible. It had so much potential but it tasted like you were eating the ocean and not in a good way. I told them it was terrible and they took it off.   Short rib pasta- it was the best one, it was worth getting again, I wish the presentation was nicer, it looked like it was just thrown on there, kind of scant and random on the plate.   This place is expensive but you're in Vegas so you can't be surprised everything is expensive. I don't think I would recommend this place based on food only.   It's very stuffy in here, tables r very close to each other.   Service was ok not amazing not terrible. I wasn't sure if our server was annoyed half the time or he just had a RBFace.

Truffle Polenta (5): OMG can I have you every day. I could have left after just eating this and been so happy. So creamy and flavorful. Truffle flavor came out so well, and the extra crunch you get from the mushrooms made it perfect. Gorgeous dish also.   Special-Cheese ravioli with black truffles (5 stars): Had to get the special since I love black truffles. They shave on a good amount too. The ravioli was really good and the black truffles and foam made it amazing. Very filling.   Chicken Entree (5 stars): So moist and flavorful. Seasoned almost like Mediterranean/Indian chicken. Really liked it.  VIEW/ATMOSPHERE (5 stars) Sat right against the window and saw the beautiful Bellagio fountains go up every 15 minutes. Gorgeous. Definitely request the window seats if you can. The place itself is nice and quiet. Great for a date night.   SERVICE (5 stars) Girls who work at the front are both beautiful and nice! I was in heels and she warned me as I was walking that the back area was slippery, which it was! So if she didn't warn me I probably would have ate it.

Not only is the food deliciously great and consistently delivers quality, the service is five stars rating itself !   My work company had their yearly convention in Vegas this past week and it fell on a Valentine's day. So I thought it would be nice to set something special for my co-workers and I.  I had called to book for their private dinning room about four months in advance. The manager signed me up ASAP. Three days before the dinner I called and asked if they can help me decorate the table and they said yes and so I dropped off a few items to them before hand. Another manager by the name of \"Cheyenne\" took care of the decorations and the results was beautifully done!! I couldn't have done it any better or ask for more.  See for yourself.  And our waiter Steve was hilariously funny as he joined in our jokes.  We had an awesome Valentine's night & dinner!   Thank you Scarpetta staff!",

My husband and his parents are Italian and they were pretty impressed with the ingredients.  However, to give a accurate review let me tell you in detail what made us take off one star. To have an Italian restaurant, at least make the menu accurate. PRIMI means PASTA dishes in Italy. Not appetizers. Please adjust so it feels authentic! Secondo are the carne...meats.  Pasta was cooked perfect al dente but lacking a little salt. Servers were very attentive, but I think we had about 3 or 4 different people ask if everything was ok, including a man in a suit. That's a bit much but if they just want to make sure we are ok then I am fine with that haha. My mother in law and myself ordered the vegetable Tagliatelle and it was perfect (minus the salt). My father in law had the pici but was disappointed, he said there was no taste. Husband had the duck and foie gras and was very happy, it was tasty but hard to digest.   We ordered 3 contorni: mushrooms; they had zero taste. Creamer potatoes; best thing from all the contorni, but that's sad cause they are in the end just potatoes. And last, we had Broccolini. No taste and a little raw.  For a celebrity chef owning the restaurant, he could kick it up a notch for the contorni.",

    "text": "For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to splurge a bit for our dinner out. I got super excited when I learned this is one of Scott Conant's restaurants because I love Italian food and I see him on Chopped all the time.  The restaurant is located on the third floor, just take the escalators up near Marquee and Chandelier. I made reservations using open table for 10 pm (a bit late, but we just got drinks in Chandelier beforehand) and were seated shortly after 10 at a table near the windows. We could see the Bellagio and the watershow - very nice view.  First off, the bread basket and the toppings for it were so good! A butter marscapone, eggplant, and olive oil were provided to go with the different breads. There was a sourdough and some other types, but my favorite was this bread with mozzarella baked into it. And, I don't even like eggplant, but my favorite bread topping was the eggplant - it was that yummy.  Based on other reviews and what sounded good to us, my friend and I ordered the polenta to start, which was split into two separate dishes for us. Amazingly tasty. I have to say I haven't had polenta before, but I figured this would be a good place to try it, and boy was that a good decision. It was just so creamy with a little bit of a gritty texture, but mmmmm. I don't know how else to describe it.  For my entree I had the tagliatelle with vegetables, guanciale, and truffle zabaglione - housemade pasta! Another very mmmmmm dish. My tastebuds were happy. And for dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta with guava \"soup\". Perfect end to the meal since it was lighter, fresher, and sweet.   All in all, I thought the food was great and I would consider coming back if I was splurging a bit. Only thing I didn't really care for was the bathroom. There was only one stall for women and it wasn't that great, and my friend said there was a line of about 6 women when she went. I would expect a nice restaurant to have a nicer bathroom.",

    "text": "So disappointed! I have eaten here multiple times as a local. The Som, Kyle is GREAT, but for 3pp and  a $450 meal our service SUCKED! I walked in thinking of one specific pasta dish, that I absolutely adore! The server told me, \"no\" absolutely don't get that, pick something else without any reason.  I assumed it was because something was bad in the kitchen, chose something else, was completely unhappy but couldn't tell my server because he never came back to check on us. We were rushed to order because the kitchen was closing, then why did the restaurant allow a 10pm reservation???? We were rushed through our meal, and after appetizers our server didn't return until the table was clear to \"push us\" dessert.   I haven't been this unhappy about a meal on the strip in a long time. They are getting 2 stars because of the Somm",

    "text": "This review is for 4.5 stars.  Some of the best pasta I have ever eaten.  You can tell it was freshly prepared and so much better than any other pasta you've ever had.  The service was strong, maybe a little too intrusive at times, but overall very good.    We went with the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer, spaghetti, and duck ravioli.  The bread bowl to begin was just your typical bread.  I'm not sure why there is such great reviews for it but it was pretty average, albeit perfect dipping utensils for our appetizer.  The polenta was a great started and had a cream of mushroom taste.  The spaghetti was the best spaghetti I've ever had but it's still very plain.  The ravioli was wonderful.  A little chewy inside with freshly made pasta.  And it was actually quite filling which was very surprising considering ravioli is usually a small dish with only about 5-6 large pieces.  This dish came with about 20 medium sized.  I recommend that dish to anyone.    They have an extensive wine menu specializing in Italy but from all over the world.  This is one of your better Italian restaurants on the strip.  It has the European feel not the New York feel, so if that is the type of cuisine you're after, then give it a try.  It will run you at least $30/entree, $15-20 for appetizers, and $15 for a single drink.  My tip is to make a reservation and try to get a view of the Bellagio fountains.",

The octopus was incredible and might be the only reason I would go back - and I don't really love octopus to begin with.  The tomatoes that come with the breadbasket was also really killer.   Our server was great, got along well with the group, and recommended an excellent bottle of wine for the table.  The rest of the service was a little odd.  We had 5 or 6 of the wrong plates come to the table throughout the meal, including 3 birthday desserts before we had even ordered our food!  Not sure what was happening there.   We tried the Buratta Salad (always good, no matter what), Tuna Carpaccio (good, but compared to the other raw fish I've had here was unremarkable), Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli (the best entree I had), Short Rib Agnolotti (a little tough), Black Togliolini (incredibly fishy, uni was tough, the crab was overpowered by the rest of the dish, the amount of tobiko was aggressive and given how strongly flavored the sauce or pasta was, it wasn't needed), Spaghetti (real heavy on the basil), Al Ceppo (braised lamb - just fine), NY Steak (well prepared and cooked perfectly, still just a steak though).  We ordered desserts, but I was pretty over eating by the time it all came.  Overall, this place was just a little too hit-or-miss for me.",

Our servers were spectacular; they took the time to converse with us since it wasn't busy yet and it was very pleasant to get to know them. Can't remember their names but they have tattoos hidden under your uniforms (we were chatting about tattoos and they showed us theirs haha).The hostess on the other hand had some attitude problem when we asked to be seated some where else that happen to be right next to where waiters would enter in and out of. I'm still wondering why she sat us there when more than half of the room was empty...  Anyways, on to the good stuff that matters. THE FOOD.   I had the Spiced Rubbed NY Steak. It tasted fine; however, after sitting for 10 minutes, the steak started to taste really dry. The spices on the steak were great though...I'm just sad that halfway through my steak it started to taste dry. Maybe it was old steak. ::shrugs:: I've had steak at Delmonico and it was significantly better over there. For a renowned restaurant, I was expecting more.   My boyfriend had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli. This dish was amazing! I'm a huge fan of liver but this dish was out of this world. Mind you, I'm not big on italian food. The cream that it was submersed in was light and wasn't thick like many other italian places I've dined at. This is a must if you're ever a first timer here!",

    "text": "It took until the last night, when perhaps I was thinking a little clearer, to realize that not only there was a Scarpetta's in LV, but it was in my own hotel! Scarpetta's is one of my favorites in NYC, and who knew it was SO close to me! My friend and I were looking for a romantic, filling date before our red eye home, and I insisted that we go here!  When walking in, we actually first walked in to the restaurant next door, as the signage is a bit confusing. We finally figured it out and found the right place. When walking in it is dark, romantic, elegant and seduces you with the high class, romantic but somewhat edgy vibe, the aromas are tempting, and the music hits the right parts of your soul. We were immediately drawn to the fancy special occasion room, which was set up to look like a palace, and the incredible timing of the Bellagio fountains was displaying in the background. As we kept saying all vacation, \"What is Vegas?!\" never was more True. We had the option to sit in the formal dining room, or the seats at the bar, and for some reason found the seats at the bar to be more cozy. The dining room had the same elegant, romantic but dark charm to it, while the bar was a little lighter and more lively. However, in the dining room you can get seats that overlook the city and the fountain (not real life).  Now the menu is the same, or mostly similar to the NYC location, so I already knew what to get. The classic pasta with red sauce (what they are famous for)! My friend got the pork belly, and we split the Brussell's. There really is no comparison for their food. Little words exist to describe the perfection of the flavors, aromas, textures, and presentation. All that you need to know, is that this should be a mandatory part of everyone's trip.",

    "text": "Restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip are known to be overpriced, underwhelming, and catering to free-spending high rollers. As a local, I often try to avoid these tourist traps. The expensive menus often provide amuse-bouche after amuse-bouche-sized appetizers and minimally larger entrees leaving you wanting more (quantity). So, I was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that finally live up to the bill. I've been wanting to try Scarpetta since seeing its dineLa menu back when I lived there for a short while last year. My girlfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here with an awesome table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. She was specifically interested in their signature tasting menu, which we later found out was not offered on the weekends. However, after speaking with the chef, our waiter was excited to let us know that it was available.   For $110, each person gets a 7 course meal complete with an amazing bread basket and they even added an 8th course (or side dish). Three of the courses feature their signature dish including the scallops, spaghetti, and duck. Dinner starts off with a bread basket, which our waiter warned us not to devour. Having experienced fine dining before in Vegas, I completely ignored his advice and dug in. The best piece was the meat and cheese-filled stromboli. The bread spread came with marscapone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil. Since my girlfriend is gluten-free, I pretty much ate the entire bread basket myself. No regrets.  Next came the first course: a duo of  yellowtail and tuna. These two pieces of fish were just plain amazing. The pinch of sea salt really elevated the flavor of both pieces. Clean and simple. The diver scallops is a classic dish with a nicely seared scallop atop cannellini beans, and mushrooms. This came with a wonderfully fragrant side of the most creamy polenta with truffles I've ever had complement of the chef. The third and fourth courses were the freshly made spaghetti with tomato & basil with a shared plate of the short rib agnolotti. The spaghetti was simply perfect, the pasta version of a wonderful margherita pizza. My favorite dish of the night was the agnolotti. These small pasta morsels were filled with tender short rib and topped with brown butter and horseradish bread crumbs. My girlfriend compared these to chicken biskit crackers if you close your eyes. At this point, I was starting to get full. The fennel dusted black cod and spiced duck breast courses were a blur. I was getting delirious from the food coma I was about to enter. God, why did I eat that entire bread basket. I had to box the duck breast and muster all that I had left to prepare for the dessert. The amedei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato was the perfect ending to a marathon of a meal.   The experience was fantastic and this is by far the best value you will get on the Strip for a prix fixe meal. Both the food and service were extraordinary. A must-try restaurant for any special occasion (or if you're just looking for a fantastic treat).",

Jennie was our waitress and she did a great job as well as the waiter helping her (I think his name was Rod or Rodolfo).  Jennie walked us through the menu and provided recommendations and was conscious of the vegetarians in our group.  Everything we ordered was great and the ambiance just added to the experience.

I believe it has a lot to do with Scott Conant is no longer involved with this place.   We came in as party of nine and was lucky to get a private room/chefs table with the view of kitchen and fountain view.   The service was decent and fast. I appreciate our server's Mike who provided honest opinions/suggestions. Mike was actually our server a few years back when we had our dinner party here as well.   As soon as we got our bread basket, I realize the quality isn't there. I used to talk about their bread baskets to my friends since I love bread so much. Loved the variety and the warm and fresh bread. It's not the warm and fresh bread anymore. It's cold and a-okay bread. The eggplant dressing for the bread isn't the same either. The flavor was way off.   Thankfully, most of the appetizers and entrees that we ordered were still decent. Although my friend felt like there's less lobster in Pici now. The texture of the pasta are still great thankfully.  Another let down was the dessert, I used to love their dessert. The banana souffle and coconut panna cotta in guava soup were so good. The hotel took over the dessert department. Beside the cheesecake that our server recommended, all other dessert that we got were not impressive.   Hopefully Scarpetta will improve and get back to the quality that they used to have.",

What arrived was a salad with a 2\" sliver of anchovy on top. The wait staff kept trying to remove plates, literally in the middle of taking bites. We had to say 3 times to leave the plate because we were still eating. When we were finally done with our main course, the waiter brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else, including dessert. When we mentioned that we did want dessert, he scoffed of and never came back with any dessert menus. Finally, a different waiter showed up with the check again, and we said that we were still waiting for dessert menus. He then told us that the kitchen was \"closed\", but he would see \"what he could do\". He returned with menus, told us that only a couple of things were available. We ordered what was \"available\", whereupon he literally grabbed the check out if my hand and said \"I'm going to need this to add the extras you just ordered\". When he came back, he set the desserts down, and walked off without a word. No asking if anyone wanted coffee, or an after dinner drink. Less than 60 seconds later, he set the check back down, and stood there waiting for me to get my card out. After running the card, he came back, set the check down, said \"Have a nice evening\", and we never saw anyone again. Very poor service, and incredibly overpriced menu. I've been taking guests to the Cosmo since it opened, and probably still will, except never to Scarpetta again.",

For an appetizer we had the fried calamari.  The calamari was not crispy as we would've liked and it was very heavy.  We mentioned this to the waiter and they were kind enough to take the calamari off the bill.  I was surprised that we had staff checking on our table but none of them ever introduced themselves.  My friend and I still don't know who are actual waiter was.  We maybe had 5-6 people bring food and assist us here tonight.  For entrees we had the tomato basil pasta and the lamb fettuccine.  Both were very tasty.  I definitely recommend the pasta because it is very fresh! Nobody came to offer us cheese or fresh pepper when our pasta was served which I found surprising for a high end restaurant.  I would've liked some fresh Parmesan cheese! Oh well.

I don't usually have good luck finding an Italian Spot but I was so excited that Scarpetta delivered down to the T.  We ordered the Calamari, Short Rib Ravioli, and another Pasta that had Lamb I believe, in red sauce.  Everything was so amazing, once you bite into the ravioli you get a burst of flavor from the foie gras. The calamari was so addicting, don't forget to put the lemon on top to get the refreshing flavor!  The red sauce pasta was also perfectly cooked.  I am so happy to have found this spot and Can't wait to come back for more!",

This one, however, stands out above and beyond.  It's actually hard to find enough superlatives to describe our experience!  We shared the Cesar, which they split for us and was still a great portion.  Our table also ordered the Agnolotti and the lamb Bolognese tagliatelle.  With every bite we were singing these dishes praises.  House made pastas, delicious bread basket with three dips, and top rated wine list.  You can't go wrong here!  As we didn't have a reservation, we chose to sit in the bar area, but the private table/booths along the side are your own, private escape to enjoy this amazing food.  This will definitely be on our agenda for all future Vegas trips!",

However it took a while for us to get menus, I had to hunt down and talk to 4 people for the same request, water never got refilled until the check came (he was holding the water pitcher and I had to signal I wanted some), we were served our pasta and waited to ask for Parmesan but no one came (I had to go get someone even though there were 3 people standing around in the regular seating area), and   On the positive side, food came quickly and staff when they were interacting with you were great.   Bread - warm and tasty   Spaghetti - good, pasta good consistency  Polenta - delicious",

The vibe is chill but still energetic. The menu is interesting without being pretentious. The bread basket was 10/10.   However, before we even ordered, a staff member spilled the better part of a drink on my husband's shirt. That's not a big deal to us. Stuff happens, people drop stuff, life goes on. Our waiter apologized and brought us a napkin...and that was it. He mentioned vaguely that \"they would make it up to us\" but no gesture was made. I know it's not the end of the world, but my husband spent our dinner with wet, sticky, cold shirt (that ended up stained, for what it's worth). Great hospitality means being cared for and when mistakes are made, that's when great restaurants separate themselves. I don't feel like we were cared for particularly well.  All of that aside, the rest of our experience was fine but underwhelming. The pasta was well made and well cooked. The meat was the correct temperature. Everything was served hot. The calamari was the low point of the meal - it was chewy and overly salty (though other tables seemed to enjoy it so take my opinion with a grain of salt). It was all...good? Just not terribly memorable.   In the end, I don't think I'd return. Somehow, the whole didn't equal the parts. It could be that our meal started off on the wrong foot and we just weren't in the best place to enjoy a meal, but that's also kind of the point. We've had similar experiences where the staff went above and beyond and we left feeling positively evangelical about the restaurant. Sadly, that wasn't the case here.",

We will be back to Scarpetta to try the tasting menu; the table next to us got it and it looked to die for as well.

    "text": "Picture a classy Italian restaurant with the Bellagio Fountain water show in the background and you've got one heck of an intimate dinner experience.   I searched high and low for the top restaurants on the Strip and Scarpetta came to mind because of it's location and well known cuisine. With the dimly lit atmosphere and fine modern decor, I had a good hunch this would be the perfect place to share a late night dinner.   We came without a reservation but was immediately seated in the main dining area. The server immediately placed our menus and brought out our waters. He returned with a bread basket filled with a variety of freshly baked breads and a side of olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and cheese. Each bite was intoxicating and we had to forcibly stop to avoid getting too full.   I dared to be adventurous and ordered a Billionaire $16 (homage to homie Bobby Axelrod from \"Billions\") and thoroughly enjoyed this bourbon based cocktail with a touch of pomegranate and absinthe. This is worth coming back to at least sip at the bar to pregame or as a nightcap. My guest ordered an Eagle Rare 10 Year ($18) in addition to our meal.   We love to share our dishes and decided to exclusively order two seafood plates:  - Mediterranean Octopus ($21) olive oil poached potato, tonatto sauce & salsa verde - Fennel Dusted Black Cod ($35) asparagus, hedgehog mushroom   The grilled single tentacle of the octopus was cooked perfectly without the excess chew or toughness. The lightly seasoned potatoes matched well with the texture of the octopus. This is a must order for any seafood fans. We scrambled to see who would get the last bite and I bet you can imagine who got it.   The server was kind enough to split our black cod order for each of us to enjoy. The acidity of the tomatoes worked nicely to cut the velvety richness of the cod. With a mix of the mushrooms and sauce, the dish became ordinary to extraordinary.   Dessert was left to another venue but would like another opportunity to make room on a future visit.   Our server took care of us from start to finish. At the end, we felt slightly rushed because we were one of the last diners but overall, felt acknowledged throughout our meal.   If you're looking for an upscale meal with finesse, attentive service and a gorgeous view, consider making an OpenTable reservation here. Every bite and moment from the dinner was memorable. For now, my restaurant experience at The Cosmopolitan (STK, Rose Rabbit Lie and now Scarpetta) have been very positive and I can not wait to try the rest of their eateries.",

Now for the service I get it was a holiday weekend but the stuck up hostess just ruined the whole experience for me, came a little early and asked if it's possible if we can sit next to the window and she told us no it was not possible even though I made sure to book a table right next to a window on the reservation notes ? Luckily the manager was standing right behind her and told us there was a table available right now next to a window so me and my husband just agreed to be seated already.

The bombolini was our finisher. I would order everything again except for the Branzino, my shrimp were overcooked and it was very one dimensional.

    "text": "This place was fantastic! Here's the breakdown: Ambiance- the decor was very modern, there were some very cool light fixtures above the bar and in the bar seating area. My only issue would be that the tables were VERY CLOSE together- it made it difficult to navigate the restaurant to get to the bathroom without getting in the way of the waiters trying to work.  Service- A+ from start to finish. We did not see an open reservation on OpenTable so we called  and the maitre d' was so wonderful and gracious and was able to fit us in! We got a great table by the window and our waiter was just great. He took us through the menu, made great suggestions and really made us feel taken care of.  Food- overall very good. For starters my fiance and I split the diver scallops (a small portion but we were not very hungry). The scallop was cooked perfectly, and the marcona almonds really added a delicious flavor and crunch. My only complaint would be the lack of flavor from the golden raisins that the menu said were in the dish. I was hoping for that sweet flavor but I never tasted it. For dinner we got the Pici and the Short Rib Agnolotti. These were both great! The Pici was spicy (which I enjoyed but my fiance thought was a little too much), and the Short Rib Agnolotti was phenomenal- possibly one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had! For dessert we had the coconut panna cotta which was actually quite tasty- not something I would have normally ordered but I was pleasantly surprised -a good mix of flavors and very refreshing! Overall- I would absolutely go here again and I have already recommended this restaurant to two other friends that are planning upcoming trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "Mostly Exceptional Food, Mostly Forgettable Service.   I've been wanting to come here ever since seeing this place featured on Food Network's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate.' We came as a party of 5 to include my parents, 2 year old son and wife.  We came in and the hostess was less than friendly. She asked my name then took us to our table without a word.   We sat down and waited much too long for our waiter. This became a theme throughout the night. He finally came by and simply told us the daily special and asked what we wanted to drink. I've been to many upscale restaurants around the world, and this would be unacceptable at any of them. He didn't take any time to explain the menu, how people normally order, etc.   The menu was divided into courses which led me to believe people ordered many courses. However, with the price of each dish this would get prohibitively expensive quite quickly. I asked the waiter and pointed out that people ordered at most 2 dishes and that they were not family style. I'd expect the opposite with authentic Italian.  The drinks took FOREVER to come out, nearly being outpaced by our appetizers! We didn't order anything outrageous: 2 bourbons neat, 2 martinis and some milk. The bourbon list was one of the most extensive I've seen in a restaurant, mind you I just returned from 3 years in Japan.   Our appetizers came out and were presented well. I ordered the creamy polenta into which the waiter scooped in fricasseed mushrooms. It had wonderful texture and taste; my wife hates polenta but loved it, even more than her butternut squash soup. It was ok, but had a Chinese five spice taste to it we found off putting. The bread and spreads were good and my dad enjoyed his Endive salad, despite the waiter giving it to my mom at first. Again, at this price point, unacceptable!  For the main course three of us ordered the spaghetti with tomato and basil and one got the short rib / bone marrow agnolotti. Both were mind blowing: must haves.   Two of us got chocolate souffle for dessert; I got the bombolonis and my mom got the panna cotta. The chocolate souffle had that nasty five spice flavor to it again. Gross! I was certainly not a fan. The bombolonis were a can't miss as they were filled with Nutella, although the banana gelato was an awkward pairing.  The panna cotta was wonderfully fruity and refreshing. My mom got the best dessert for sure.   I would come back here for the spaghetti, panna cotta and bourbon list, and hopefully we'd get a better waiter.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to spend a semester studying abroad in Rome and Sicily, it was easily the greatest experience of my life. Ever since I have been on never ending search to find an Italian restaurant that can match the authentic flavors that Italy is famous for.... the search is over, Scarpetta is that restaurant.   Squid ink pasta is a staple of Italian cuisine, yet it's almost impossible to find on a menu in the states. Scarpetta does it justice. The \"black fettuccine\" is cooked to perfection and topped with king crab, squid, shrimp, and lobster corral breadcrumbs... ho l'acquolina in bocca.   Scarpetta also has the best Italian dessert I have tasted in years. The bomboloni is heavenly. They are nutella filled donuts lightly fried and served with banana gelato. They conjure up memories of sitting on the banks of the Tevere river eating bomboloni and people watching in the Italian sun.   La vita e breve, festeggiare con gli amici, l'amore come non c'e domani.",

It is, a bit pricey, however. I think spaghetti with marinara sauce is something like $25. It is, however, probably the best spaghetti you'll eat! I had the broccoli rob ($11) and the potatoes ($11) and let me tell you...they were absolutely delicious! I can't describe the flavor because it was so perfect. While $22 for broccoli and potatoes seems a bit pricey, I think it was worth every penny. My mom had gluten free pasta in a marinara sauce and my dad had some sort of ravioli. They both said their meals were delicious as well.",

I booked my reservation through Open Table. We showed up to our reservation roughly 15 minutes early. I gave the hostess my name and thus the amazing dining experience began.  I started off asking my waiter what he would recommend for a cocktail that I couldn't get anywhere else. He immediately recommended a drink that had bourbon in it. I'm not a bourbon fan, but I decided that I should give it a try. I cent remember the name of the drink, but it was the first one on the list of specialty cocktails. What I experienced next can only be described as an orgasm in my mouth. It was absolutely amazing.   My dinner date and I shared two appetizers. We had the octopus, which was good but a bit flavorless, and the scallops. The scallops were unreal. Absolutely awesome. Also, he bread that they bring you with the baked cheese inside of it is great as well. For our second plate we shared a lobster spaghetti plate. Once again, phenomenal.  My dinner date had lamb and it was great. The meat absolutely melted in my mouth. I had some sea bass that was also very good.  Overall, for two appetizers, 3 drinks, a pasta plate, and two main courses, the meal was less than $200. We've been to Barelotta at the Wynn, and while this might not be the same caliber of food, the price comparison makes this place phenomenal.",

Bummed we ended up going.  The food wasn't great and the server was rude and clearly needed to turn the table.  He literally kept returning to the table every 2 minutes until we ordered and then would stand at the table while we were in mid conversation and I stare until we stopped talking.  Not what you expect at a nice restaurant! We ordered the $70 porterhouse which came smothered in a cheese sauce (who puts cheese on that cut of meat?!), the cod which looked like a dry pork chop when it came and was smothered in a tomato paste, and the duck which was far from tender and cam in these two huge chunks. All in all super disappointing.  Maybe pasta is the way to go there.",

I was so happy! We were too full for dessert but the waiter still brought us some petits fours (complements of the chef). The food was simply amazing, every bite was so delectable!

I would've been happy with either the fluffy dinner rolls, the buttery, toasted focaccia, or the simple, crusty Italian bread on their own. And any one of the citrus-infused olive oil, the eggplant caponata or the marscopone butter accompaniments would have been not only generous, but irresistibly delicious.  Surprisingly, Scarpetta lays every one of these items in front of you in a sumptuous, complimentary carby feast, along with the absolute kicker: STROMBOLI. That's meaty, cheesey bread, people; it's a meal in itself, and a damn good one.   I knew I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but stuff my face with the free delights. And although I was already full when they arrived, I forced myself to choke down the simple, perfect spaghetti, as well as a beautifully rare aged sirloin in a Barolo reduction.  I might not have any friends and/or social skills, and later that evening, I may or may not have lost my pants* downstairs playing craps...but eating this flawless meal means I'm a winner anyway. __________  *I think The Bellagio is now in possession of my shirt.

The ambiance at this sophistocated Cosmopolitan restaurant is very sexy, and we were fortunate enough to be seated by the huge picture window with views of the Bellagio fountains spraying in the background.  To enjoy your meal at Scarpetta as I did, follow these instructions and thank me later:  1) Start of with a glass of Gosset.  There aren't many wines by the glass to choose from on the menu, but a glass of Gosset (even if it'll set you back $20 for a singular champagne flute of this nectar from the gods) is worth it.  2) Sample the fritto misto and Wagyu beef tartare to start.  Sure, these are old Italiano standbys, but they do it up here, adding cured egg, parmigiano, toasted hazelnuts, and sea salt to the tartare.  SO GOOD.  3) Devour the black farfalle (with Maine lobster) and the spiced duck breast (with endive, preserved orange, and delicious cippollini onion).  I split these dishes with my friend and it was the perfect portion size, not to mention SCRUMPTIOUS.  Jersey was a good choice to wear during this meal.  4) Polish it all off with the Zeppole for dessert, if you're a fan of Nutella.  Grazie mille, Scarpetta, for a wonderful experience!  I will definitely be back to try your famous spaghetti.",

One down side - they were not offering the tasting menu the evening I was there. As a fan of tasting menus (especially with wine pairings!) this was disappointing. Anyway, as others have mentioned, the bread is great. We also started with the short rib risotto appetizer as well as the fritto misto. Both were delightful. As far as the entrees - myself and my 3 dining partners all got pasta. The spaghetti (again, as many other reviewers have commented on) was wonderful. I don't think I've EVER ordered spaghetti at a restaurant and probably wouldn't had I not read the rave reviews on yelp (though the waiter did highly recommend it). It was simple yet extremely tasty. The only gripe I have is it seemed a little overpriced given the minimalistic dish (~$24) but was fair given the prices of other dishes on the menu. We also tried the duck and foie gras ravioli which was rich and delicious. The beef short rib pasta was also very good, though a little too horseradishy for my taste.   The food would've earned the restaurant 5 stars in my book regardless, but the service made the experience one of a kind. Maybe the waiter has the same \"routine\" for everyone, but who cares? He was attentive, friendly, professional but not at all annoying.   The only bad part about the night is I didn't get to try dessert (too full)!",

    "text": "Amazing experience!! Started with a couple cocktails at the very hip/swanky bar. Was led to our table by a stunning hostess. We overlooked the Bellagio fountains, by far one of the best veiws in Vegas.   We took our seats and were greeted by a very friendly server who offered great suggestions and answered all of our food questions.    We looked thru the wine list and decided to ask for a somm to guide us. A smartly dressed younger gentleman came to our table and convinced us to try something new and interesting. It was a little more then I usually spend but decided to trust him. I have to say he really nailed it! Amazing wine, we wound up buying another bottle half way thru our meal!  Speaking of the meal....spectacular!! Perfectly cooked pasta, my duck was incredible. The service through out was impressive to say the least. The best I've had in Vegas in quite a long time. We will be back again for sure!",

    "text": "Scarpetta knows how to make a girl happy.  I went there this past Sunday for my very good friend's birthday dinner. She said she had the spaghetti a year ago in Miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  Now I know why! Before I get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. My group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. A few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. That's uncommon for shi-shi- type places and I really appreciated it. The decor was a dark/ modern/ rustic all-at-the-same time- type of feel. Very sexy place :o) Plus it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and the Strip! Nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view.  The sommelier was a delight. He helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. We thought it was hilarious when he said \"How about this vintage\" while pointing right at the price. Very classy way to help price-concerned consumers w/o announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money. A bread basket is usually of no consequence BUT, here, it was SOOOOO good! One roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! Fresh, warm, and perfect! We shared a bunch of starters.  I got the yellowtail fully intending to share but that did not happen. It was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before I could send my plate around the table... OOPS!  I also managed to get a bite for my friend's creamy polenta. To. Die. For. says it all. Next, our main course  - the spaghetti. Let me preface this by saying that 6 out the 7 people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. We were not disappointed. I normally try to stay away from carbs and I seriously cannot remember the last time I went out and actually ordered spaghetti! It was just so good! It wasn't a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. It was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. PS. it was great on its own - no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. That is a plate I would certainly order again.  In sum, I had a great experience. I paid ~ $100 for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and 3 glasses of wine and I still can say that it was well worth the price.  I would go back and definitely recommend Scarpetta - Vegas to friends!  :o)",

When Keller was contemplating opening a restaurant in Vegas, he refused to consider putting up a branch of The French Laundry there because, in his opinion, Vegas was too informal and boisterous for an experience which intended to be intensely focused and all-encompassing.  Scarpetta, however, proves that this idea is outdated.  This is a restaurant, located right in the center of the action on the Las Vegas strip which, despite the non-ending commotion, offers an experience in which the diner is able to enjoy the entirety of a meal without nary a distraction.  Las Vegas, instead of detracting from the experience of a fine meal, is now enhancing it.",

    "text": "We went to Scarpetta to celebrate our 9 year anniversary. As requested, they gave us a table so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Our reservation was at 9 PM and we were disappointed to find out that the chef was no longer offering the tasting menu that evening. Our waiter, however, said we could create our own tasting - excellent!    We started with the polenta with mushrooms - delicious, but it maybe could have used a bit more salt. Next up was the infamous $24 spaghetti. Well worth it - this is the best pasta I ever ate. Since we were indulging, the next course was more pasta. The duck and foie gras ravioli. It was good, but very rich and not even close to as good as the beef cheek ravioli from Carnevino. I am not sure why people would compare the two. On carb overload we then had the lamb which was fantastic. For some reason they also sent out a duck entree which we had not ordered. Not a fan of the spices - cardamom and clove. Nor was I a fan of the waiter attempting to charge us for it.  Dessert was the chocolate salted caramel cake. Good, but nothing to rave about.   Wine prices are high but on par with everything else on the strip.   Oh, I almost forgot the bread basket and dipping sauces. The Stromboli bread with salami and cheese is phenomenal. The marscapone butter could make even cheap white bread taste good.   Definitely worth a visit to try the spaghetti. I will be going back for that!",

    "text": "4th of July weekend in Vegas - we thought it would be nuts, but we were pleasantly surprised we were able to make a reservation for Scarpetta.   We were thrilled when the hostess seated us right next to a window, and no sooner had we sat when the fireworks started over Caesar's Palace! Our waiter was smart enough to know we having a romantic moment watching them and let us be until the end. Shortly after, he arrived and took our drink orders. I believe he was a bit new - possibly a bit nervous, but he had very good instincts and was very nice. Our water glasses did not go empty once and empty plates/glasses were removed immediately. Again, our waiter was not in a rush, but he was not ignoring us either....he really set a nice pace for us for the meal. It was nice to take our time and enjoy the ambiance, which is really a highlight of this restaurant.   The meal: We're pretty avid fans of the Food Network, and while you'd think the celebrity chefs might be overrated on the Strip especially, I have never had a bad experience with these types of restaurants. This was no exception. The bread basket is to die for....if we knew we weren't going to pay a mint for the meal itself, we might have stuffed ourselves with that alone. Our waiter recommended the spaghetti, which the chef is particularly known for. We decided to split it (they're not snobby about that at this place which is great!) as an appetizer - and it was very good. My boyfriend said he likes my spaghetti better, but I loved it. We had the veal chop for the entree, which we also split - that was very good as well.   Overall, I don't think our meal was crazy expensive - it was very much in line with the price you'd pay at any other of the strip restaurants. The portions were small, yes, but we also respect not gorging ourselves to death...that's what the buffets are for.   I can't say what would make me give this restaurant a 5 star rating as opposed to a 4 star...but, I'm definitely willing to go back to find out. Enjoy the Cosmopolitan - it's stunning inside, enjoy this restaurant - the views and food are great, and enjoy each other if you're in a romantic mood - this is the place!",

    "text": "Came here for a girl's weekend out. What a great experience!  Scarpetta is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's quite swanky, so you will want to dress up so you don't stick out like a sore thumb. The ambience is classy /sophisticated. The lighting is a bit dark, but that's why this is a great set up for looking out the window at night to see the Bellagio water show. It's a great place to take a date or to just have a \"let's get dressed up cuz we can\" night out with the girls. We had a reservation, so we were seated immediately. May I just mention that the service here is magnificent. There was just the three of us, but they still sat us in a huge booth that can easily sit 6 people. It's a circular booth, so I was a little apprehensive about scooting with my little black dress on. Without saying a word, our host slid the whole table out, so that we can walk to our seats instead of scooting. From then, they had already won me over =).  Ok, let's get to the food shall we? We started with the \"Braised short ribs of beef\" which is placed over root vegetables and risotto. Delish. The short rib was soft and delicate and melt in your mouth deliciousness. Not over seasoned at all. There are four small pieces, but each bite is delightful. The other appetizer that we decided to share was the \"Roasted Sea Scallops\" which is served over cauliflower, bottarge, cili and caper sauce. Aaaaaaaaaa-mazing. If I wasn't so nice, I would've eaten both pieces instead of share it. ;-) The complimentary bread came with three spreads - butter, eggplant, and olive oil. All three tasted great and the different types of bread were warm and soft and all kinds of good =P. And since I love bread... this just won me over even more. So since this is an Italian restaurant and the chef became famous because of his spaghetti, we all decided to order pasta. We ordered \"Duck and foie gras ravioli\", \"spaghetti,\" and \"stracci\"... all of which were heavenly. The ravioli was soft, but not mushy and filled with such great flavor that my friend, who was already really full midway, ate the whole entire dish. Spaghetti - you think it's just regular good ol' spaghetti... not at all. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was on point. Not too salty, not too sweet. perfect. My dish was the Stracci - flat pieces of hand made noodles with lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil breadcrumbs. If you're mouth has not watered just reading that - something is seriously wrong with you. This is probably my most favorite pasta dish. They did not skimp on the blue crabs (I at least believe it's blue crabs, though, I can't be entirely sure), the lobster mean, and the shrimp. I wanted to save room for dessert, but I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with this dish. I loved that the flat noodles didn't stick to each other and it was soft and just really well made. I loved loved loved it! I wish I could tell you we ordered dessert. But the three of us were just so full that we decided to opt out of the dessert. Though all of them sounded amazing. In any case, I rarely give out 5's. For me, something has to stick out. In this case, though the food was extraordinary, the service and the view puts it over my usual 4 stars into  a 5 star yelp review. Bottom line: I would definitely come here again.. so there's not reason why you shouldn't try it out =)",

    "text": "Prime location, delicious food, and great service...our meal at Scarpetta was definitely one of the highlights of our Vegas trip. There were a few missteps on our food adventure, but not nearly discouraging enough to detract from the overall experience.   We made reservations for 6:30 on Thursday night, which seemed to be the latest time to arrive and get one of the tables overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We got the last one available. The only issue with the view is that there is a giant metal bar running exactly eye level across the window, so you have to pop your head up like a little meercat just to get a glimpse of the fountains. Oh well.  We ordered the tasting menu and told the waiter that we'd like a bottle of white wine, somewhere in the semi-sweet to semi dry range, full-to-medium bodied, in the $50-60 range. The waiter brought us two options to taste, and we went with a delicious riesling. The bread course came with a lovely tray of marscapone cheese whipped butter, lemon infused olive oil, and a delicious fresh tomato spread. We didn't eat too much, because we knew we had seven courses of awesome heading our way:  1) The first course was yellowtail and tuna sushi. The yellowtail was served with thin pink rock salt wafers that complemented the fish perfectly. The tuna was rolled around marinated vegetables and served with preserved mushrooms. Everything was light, fresh, and flavorful. An excellent way to start a meal. A crispy fritto misto came on the side - the tempura fried herbs and lemon were a delicious addition to the standard tempura fare - shrimp...veggies...etc.  2) The second course was a sea scallop served on top of cauliflower, with a cauliflower puree, chili oil, and a salad with capers on top. - The capers were a bit salty for my liking, so I pulled them off, and the cauliflower with the cauliflower puree was a little redundant, but oh. my. goodness. That scallop was the best I've ever had. The crust was perfectly carmelized, and the scallop inside was tender and melted in your mouth. The small trace of heat from the chili oil added an unexpected twist to the dish and really took it to another level.   3) The chef added in course number three - creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. My biggest complaint here is that I can never eat anyone else's polenta again. Amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. My friend and I dove into this lake of creamy, buttery, savory goodness with reckless abandon, knowing full well that we were completely spoiling our appetite for the four remaining courses. If nobody had been watching, I would have licked the bowl. We took a little break before moving on in the meal.  4) The pasta course was both a super high and super low note in the meal. After seeing Scott Conant revered as the King of Spaghetti on television time after time, we finally got to see what all the fuss was about. The simple spaghetti dish was amazing. I have never had pasta so perfectly al dente. There was a bite to it that other pastas lack, almost to the point where you feel like it will stick in your teeth, but it doesn't. It was served with a fresh tomato basil sauce that was so perfect, it didn't need any fancy infused oils or architechtural garnishes. It was just pasta perfection.  HOWEVER, the short ribs angnolotti with brown butter horseradish sauce was just awful. The horseradish sauce blew away every other flavor on the plate, and it wound up tasting like a big plate of mustard. This is the awkward thing about not liking a dish in a tasting course - we were only halfway through the meal and we'd had such good courses previously, that we felt a little awkward sending it back...so we just moved forward with the meal.  5) The next course was a black cod with concentrated tomato sauce and carmelized fennel. Perfect crispy skin, rich, flavorful sauce, and crunchy fresh veggies - definitely a hit.  6) Spiced duck breast with endive, cippolini onions, and a preserved orange - this dish was ingenious. The duck, endive, and onion were perfectly cooked, but it was the addition of the super thin slice of sweet preserved orange that really made the dish.   7) Dessert - simply outstanding - a chocolate lava cake on a streak of carmel sauce with toasted almond gelato on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs, with a delicate twirl of chocolate as a garnish.   The only problem with this meal is that it was so delicious, there was no way you could leave anything on your plate. My friend and I polished off every dish - which left us feeling so full that we barely made it out of the restaurant.  If you decide to attempt this delicious seven course food adventure - open your wallets wide - food, drinks, and tip set us back $350...but it was well worth it.",

We had dinner reservations at 8:30 pm and it was hard getting into the Cosmopolitan Hotel because of all the traffic. We got seated right next to the window overlooking the Bellagio Fountain. The menu is very simple. We had the following:  Softshell crabs             3/5 stars the crabs were extra large. Deep fried and kinda                                                          greasy. Polenta                           5/5 stars off the hook good. excellent must order!  Heirloom Tomato Salad 4/5  stars   good fresh and dressed well.  Yellowtail sashimi           4/5  stars   4 small thinly slices pieces. Normal sushi fare.  Duck Foie Gras Ravioli     4/5 stars OK not the gastronomic orgasm as other yelpers                                                               mentioned Spaghetti                           4/5 stars excellent al dente,   Barzano Fish                     5/5 stars best entree' of the night well cooked.  Cheese cake                     4/5 stars OK small poker chip sized.  Strawberry Souffle'           5/5 stars AMAZING ! light great strawberry flavor with a                                                               dollop of vanilla ice cream.   If you can get a seat next to the window over looking the Bellagio Fountain and the Las Vegas Strip the meal is well worth the prices. Service was excellent.",

Had the duck and foie gras ravioli and it was equally as amazing....a bit rich but not overly rich where you felt sick after.  Was able to polish off the entire dish with no problem - and the portion was pretty generous considering you're at a high-end restaurant.  Normally at great Italian places they tend to skimp on the portions but they didn't.  My mom had the black cod and that was tasty as well.....but since their pasta is fresh I would recommend trying one of their pastas.  Bread basket was great, they have this salami bread that was awesome!    Definitely have to try the one in Beverly Hills now!",

We celebrated our 11 year anniversary here & not sure why it look so long to get here as we've tried everything at The Cosmo except for this place!   Walking in was a little awkward because you go down a very narrow space & pass the bar to get to the beautiful main dining room. It was the perfect combination of feminine & masculine which happens to be my favorite combo for any space! Lots of wood, very warm color palette yet there were sexy curves everywhere like the furniture, lighting & seating arrangements. Everything about the space was very beautiful. It felt like a man & woman got together to create it.   The view of the Bellagio Fountains is always stunning as it never gets old for me and the service was on point. Thank you to our waiter for the complimentary champagne & dessert which was banana souffle (AMAZING)!  Now for the carb overload ~ the classic spaghetti is popular as it should be because it was perfect. Fresh noodles, sweet sauce with a hint of basil & garlic. The famous polenta! WOW! Creamy heaven! The duck & foie gras ravioli was beyond decadent and then the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (climax) I wanted to lick my plate! I was so full but I savored every single little bite as it's possibly one of the top dishes EVER! I still think about it...  Had a few cocktails as well & just sat back & enjoyed ourselves while watching the fountains. It was a beautiful evening & I cannot wait to go back! It's very rare to enjoy everything but I really did.",

I was a little worried because I'm vegan and they are very big meat eaters and they are super fancy with a lot of money.   This restaurant could not have been NICER! we ended up doing the tasting menu for the table and they did a whole separate tasting for me (without making a big deal out of it which I REALLY appreciated). My food was so incredible and I didn't feel like an outcast. I can't tell you how grateful I am and was.   This place has an incredible view of the Bellagio fountain and all the food is outstanding. The service was wonderful, super accommodating and had a really mellow, positive and professional energy. I loved it and I will 100% come back and recommend to anyone.",

My has been was still dreaming about the last time he ordered a fillet there so he ordered it again and it was absolutely amazing. Service was fantastic as well.

Watching the fountains go off every 15 minutes gave the meal that additional magic. We started with the basil spaghetti, our waiter split it into two portions so we each could sample it. It was amazing, the fresh pasta, tomato sauce and basil gave it a delicate taste and not over powering. Definitely a must get. My husband had the short rib ravioli and thought it was delicious and very flavorful. I got the salmon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The greens were a bit bitter and burnt but that was the only negative we experienced. We finished with a salted caramel custard that was incredible. All the staff worked well together to be very attentive to us throughout dinner too. I'm pretty sure this will become a Vegas staple in our yearly trips!",

The reservations were easy to come by as it was a Monday night and the place was not too busy.  The food was solid.  Started with the yellowtail appetizer that was simple and refreshing.  The secondi was the short rib agnolotti.  This was by far the best dish of the night.  Plentiful, tasty and the texture was superb.  The primi was the veal chop which was a good size portion but the quality left a little to be desired.  The service was off for a slow night.  They didn't have the scotch that the wife ordered so they default brought Macallan 12 saying that it tasted like the one we had ordered.  Also, my agnolotti came way after the others were served, they had forgotten it, but they comped the dish, so I guess that was ok.  There was just some general confusion here and there about who ordered what.  All in all, it was ok.  Over-priced for what it is.",

It was a good thing I did because it's the best I've ever had! The spaghetti noodles were a perfect texture, firm but not too firm, just the right amount. The sauce was a very simple tomato sauce but it was so creamy. It was such a basic dish yet the flavor was so rich.

It was charred perfectly with plenty of juice from the chop.  I really didn't even need the apricot mustard.  Honestly, I could have had the chop alone.  Well that and the Il Dolce Lemone.

    "text": "The wife and I were in Vegas on vacation and her younger cousin and his GF were in town the same week so we wanted to take them out to a nice dinner.  I didn't have a chance to check out Scarpetta when I was last here in November, so this seemed like a perfect time.    The room is absolutely beautiful, and we were lucky enough to get seated near a window, so we could also watch the Bellagio Fountain show at the same time.  I was thinking, this night is going to be perfect right......maybe not.  So the server comes to take our drink order.  I'm a simple guy, so I just ordered a Miller Lite.......he kind of looks at me and is like \" Bud \".  I'm like ok, nevermind.  Can I get a Stella instead?  He's like Yup.  I'm like.... ok.  Then he leaves and the busser brings over the bread basket full of win~!  The bread was a salami roll, as well as some Focaccia, and what looked like some french baguette.  The busser really explained the different condiments they had for the bread well.  He had a thick accent, so it was a little difficult to understand, but he did a nice job explaining it.  He left and our server came back with the beer....a Bud.  I'm like...seriously, I just told you  Stella?  Then my wife's cousin asks him a bit about the condiments (mascarpone, some eggplant tapenade, and some olive oil) and if there is a certain one that is recommended for the different breads.   He's like I don't know, they're all good.  I'm like....seriously?  Then we get around to ordering our Apps and entrees.  We started with the braised shortribs and the fritto misto.....both were great.  The shortribs were very tender and flavorful.  The fritto misto,was crunchy and not oily either.  We then ordered our entrees. My wife and her cousin ordered the Short rib agnolotti, the cousins GF ordered the Lamb loin.  Haha, we could already tell how our waiter was, so for fun, she asked him how the Lamb was.  You would think at a nicer upscale restaurant like this, he would boast about the preparation, or the sauce, or how tender the meat was......nope.  When she asked how it was, he said \"good.\"  Really?  I thought restaurants made money by putting crap on the menu?  Anyways, back to lucky old me.  I asked the waiter about the Spaghetti with Basil (which is what lots of people rave about) or the Stracci.  He was like it's ok, but it's kind of plain.  Not sure if he was trying to upsell me, but I don't know if Scott Conant would appreciate one of his servers calling his food plain.  Anyways, I took his advice and order the Stracci.  Or did I?  Because even if I ordered the Stracci, that's not what was placed in front of me when the rest of the order came around.  I looked at the guy and was like \"didn't I tell you Stracci?\"  Oh, I'm not sure, let me check.  Seriously?  What the hell, can this really be happening.  Anyways, I waited patiently like a fool, while everybody else ate.  To Scarpetta's defense, all the entrees were really good and flavorful, just the guy serving us needed a clue.  We moved on to dessert and ordered the chocolate cake (a bit too heavy for me), the coconut panna cotta (awesome!), and the cheesecake (light, airy, completely delicious).  The waiter comped us an order of Zeppole's for his lack of service, and it too was great.    Overall, I was just disappointed that the service was so poor.  I was REALLY looking forward to having a wonderful night with family and friends, but it ended up just being ok.  Too bad",

The dishes really failed to impress me. I ordered the Halibut and felt like all it really needed was a dash of salt and lemon to really pick up the taste. One of the girls ordered extra marinara or something for her calamari, so I put that on my fish and it gave it the flavor it NEEDED. The bachelorette had the Polenta as an appetizer, which she loved. But overall, we were not impressed with this place or the dishes. And come on, $24 for spaghetti!? Even if I made it from scratch, it'd cost less than $10. Just sayin'",

I was dining solo, and was seated at the best table in the restaurant with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains that are splendid.  The stromboli in the bread basket is delicious!  Loved the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala.  Very generous portion.  The main course of duck with endive was very good (very soft), but I've had better duck dishes (Le Cirque and Robuchon in LV).  The zeppoles were a bit overdone (too dark) and there was too much nutella filling.",

BUT the view of the Bellagio fountains at sundown was fantastic and the service was the best I have had anywhere.  We had half a dozen oysters to start with, duck foie gras ravioli, and truffled pasta.  The first bite was very good but after that everything was very one-noted and boring.  Taste buds were not enthused by the end of dinner.  While the staff was VERY good the service can get slow.  We almost missed our 10:30pm show as we were at dinner for over 2 hours. My only regret is that I should have tried the Spaghetti!",

But the music is WAY too loud for fine dining.  Do I want a hard rock band screaming at me at obscene decibels when I bite into 4 paper-thin pieces of the best Yellow Tail I've put into my mouth, ever?  No, not for $16.  That's 4 bucks a bite, and the hard core, fingernails on a chalkboard in a megaphone screaming is free.  The wine list is awesome.  Splurge and you'll never regret it.  Their famous spaghetti is famous for a reason.  $26 for pasta and some sauce.  That's it?  Yes.  And it's worth every penny.  The veal is stellar on every level, with the chanterelles, mini-me artichokes, fruit reduction, a hint of cumin, and sweet breads (my sweet breads were a little dry, though).  The veal itself is all the crispy outside, tender/moist inside, and intensity of flavors you're hoping for.  The coconut/guava ice cream desert was very, very good and light.  5 stars.  The cheese course was only okay.  Three small pieces of cheese the size of my thumb underwhelmed me.  I would pass on this next time.  We were spoiled by Providence's cheese course, though.  Awesome capuccino.",

The wine list has everything from a $65 bottle up to some rare things that are well over $10,000.   Honestly, the food was amazing. Between the three of us, we had a pasta dish, a veal dish, and a duck dish. All of them cooked perfectly, and they melted in your mouth.   Dessert was just as good - if not better.   All of the food, and the decor is made even more complete by the view. From our table, we had a gorgeous view of the fountains at the Bellagio.  While you can go overboard on price, three of us were able to get out of there with a bill under $300. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends, and willbe back again in the future.",

I wanted some pasta and Scarpetta's RW menu online looked good. It was our last night there and we had to catch our flight, so we booked the earliest table possible. We walk in and are handed the regular menu, no RW menu. We're sort of hungover and tired and I think maybe i read the dates wrong, so we go ahead and order off the regular menu. No big.  Then other tables start coming in. They are all given the RW menu enthusiastically. I ask our waiter if it is RW. He says yes, we just started it tonight. I ask why we weren't given the chance to participate--it IS for charity, after all.  He says, oh...ummm...well...it's by INVITATION ONLY.  Waiter, you are a LIAR.  Oh, really?, I say with an eyebrow.  Yep, sorry, he says, and walks off.  Just say you f'd up, and comp our dessert or something. Don't treat me like I'm some idiot.

    "text": "After hearing such great reviews about this place from friends, my fiance chose to have his birthday  here in the private chef's room.  I had high expectations for this place but I cannot express how greatly disappointed I was mostly because of the absolutely TERRIBLE SERVICE we received from our server Christian.  We were a party of 5 so it's not like we were a very complicated table to serve.  He got us our drinks we started with the scallops for the table which were good.  Then when he asked for our dinner order we asked what he recommended and he just seemed very annoyed and not interested at all to sell anything to us!  So now everyone's main has arrived, no ones dish is explained to them at all so I guess you just have to guess what exactly it is that your eating here.  After the first bite into my uni crab pasta it is flavorless to me so I'm waiting for our server Christian to kindly come check on us after our first bites to see how everything tastes. I guess he went on his dinner break because we were just about through with our meals by the time he decided to see how everything was. We all needed drinks too.  So now everyone's through with their dinner and the busser comes in and clears the table.  I really wanted to order desserts for the table but we were never offered the option of dessert because I had brought a cake for my fiance which he just so rudely brought out to us with no warning.  No expression of a happy birthday at all, I guess he is just not that into his job, I don't know. He cuts the cake for us then disappears for about 30 minutes! Finally my fiance asks for the check because we were all just so over it here! He comes back to get his tip and doesn't bother with a thank you for his tip that he so did not deserve!",

The duck foie gras ravioli was rich and savory. The only dish was did not care for was the oratta which was a fish dish with a tomato based sauce.

Unfortunately the service at this location is so disappointing.  Our greeting was frazzled and rushed, our seat was lovely looking at the fountains nice and private. Our server from first greeting had an awful attitude-rather snotty really and never shared his name. Our food was absolutely perfect but our overall experience was ruined by lack of service here. I specifically said I would like wine with my dinner as my last experience in Miami was heightened by the perfectly selected glass of wine by the charming sommelier.  Here our glasses were left empty our entire meal!  My husband had finished his cocktail before the appetizer!  When dinner arrived we were over half finished before our server asked if everything was fine.  Clearly this was disappointing which then caused us to decide to not have another drink nor coffee and dessert as we had hoped.  When we asked for the check the server asked if there was something wrong which was frustrating and we chose to not bother as it seemed that could be confrontational.  Again, our food was perfect it was just a completely different feel than expected-one I would not want to repeat.",

    "text": "I was slightly disappointed with the food here.  From all the reviews I read, I thought that the pasta here was going to be exceptional. First off, let me state that the waiter I had was absolutely great and the view of the Bellagio and the fountains was fantastic as well.  Since none of the appetizers sounded appealing to me, I decided to order two pasta dishes.  I first ordered the spaghetti.  On the menu, it simply states \"Spaghettti-tomato and basil.\"  As I started eating it, I realized that it was actually spicy and felt my lips burning.  Given that this is their signature dish, I expected to be blown away and I was not.  I feel that if the food is going to be spicy, they should let you know-this spaghetti certainly had more to it than simply tomato and basil.  The next dish I had was the Stracci-which was their seafood pasta dish that on the night I was there included crab, shrimp, and lobster.  The seafood was laid out on top of thin ribbons of black and yellow pasta.  While the seafood was tasty, I thought the dish was somewhat unimaginative.  Between these two pasta dishes and the bread that came out, which was fantastic, I was full and had to skip dessert.  Would I go back to Scarpetta?  Probably not, especially when considering there are so many fine restaurants in Las Vegas and the fact that with tax and tip, I spent close to $90 just for one person.  At the end of the day, I thought that the food was good but I just expected a bit more.",

    "text": "I thought Scarpetta was supposed to be a step up from DOCG, but unfortunately found it to be the opposite. Have had several great experiences at DOCG, but rather than topping it, Scarpetta didn't even compare.  STARTERS BREAD BASKET: Five types of bread (the olive-studded one and the rolled spinach and cheese were favorites) and three dipping sauces (really liked the tomato tapenade, lemon olive oil was aromatic). RAW YELLOWTAIL ($18): Four thin slices of yellowtail sashimi, accented with ginger oil and red onion, and what seemed to be sea salt? Liked it but not worth the price. ENGLISH PEA SOUP ($19): Much better than the version at Giada's. I liked the mint accents and flavorful rock shrimp, though there could have been more of it. Note that this is a hot soup, not chilled. MEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS: Not the best version I've had but good, I liked that it was a pretty plate formed using one whole octopus tentacle rather than pieces as elsewhere. This is plated with ceci beans and what seemed to be hummus.   PASTAS SPAGHETTI: BF's pick, and his favorite for the night. Classic but well-made spaghetti with tomato and basil. I agree with another reviewer who said this dish tasted like the pasta version of a margherita pizza. ORECCHIETTI: \"Little ears\" pasta with broccoli rabe and a house-made sausage. Neither of us really cared for this and wished we had opted to split one of the fish entrees instead. Note that this was on the night's menu in place of the gnocchetti sardi on the online menu. AGNOLOTTI: Short rib, brown butter, and horseradish bread crumbs. Ordered this dish because it was one most recommended in reviews. It was rich and I enjoyed the actual pasta, but the combination of flavors didn't especially work for me.   DESSERTS CAPPUCCINO: Very well made, no bitterness or acidity or burned taste at all, just pure, strong coffee, and a ton of foam.  STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE: Another dish that was significantly better than one I had at Giada's (hers was lemon flavored). This was like eating a cloud, it was so perfectly executed. The strawberry gelato was among the most flavorful versions I've had, and the fresh strawberry accents were so ripe that this dish didn't need the accompanying creme fraiche.  AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE: For the chocolate-lover. This was extremely rich and dense, more like a brownie than a cake. The almond gelato had almonds on top for texture, which we liked, but the flavor of the salted caramel sauce was minimal and the cake itself was a bit overcooked and hard.  The appetizers were okay, the pastas were okay, and the desserts were okay. As I left, I wished I'd just gone next door to get the incredible salted caramel bundino at DOCG, which blows both of the desserts we had here out of the water.  Service was attentive, and I appreciate that we were able to get a seat in the second row from the windows even with a last-minute reservation. Location is dark and romantic, making photos nearly impossible (and largely inappropriate). Overall quality of food was less than expected. I'll be returning to DOCG instead, even though it is more casual... they have a better wine list, too.",

We actually came here twice just for dessert despite having other dessert places to check off on my 4 day trip to Vegas. We liked it that much. I am a huge huge coconut fan, give me anything coconut and I'll have to try it. With both their cheesecake and their panna cotta having that coconut element, I absolutely had to indulge. The panna cotta is absolutely divine, the base is coconut and it's layered with a \"guava soup\" - the dessert is totally an experience. Now the cheesecake, the cheesecake was just unforgettable we loved the mango sorbet that accompanied the cheesecake to counter the sweetness, it was the perfectly balanced dessert - needless to say we devoured the whole thing.",

I still rate (most of) the food 5 stars, but the service wasn't as great as the 4 other times I dined here. It was, in fact, quite poor service. Waiting 20min from the time you finish your main entree to receive a dessert menu from someone that wasn't even our server, was frustrating. He was just never around the entire time we were there.   I also recommend NOT getting the vanilla lemon cake for dessert. It was dry and flavorless. There was more sorbet than cake, and the sorbet was bitter and sour.   As always, the black tagliolini was to-die for.",

We even got all dressed up for the occasion to have a romantic dinner together.   After being seated, it took 20 minutes for the waiter to even come over. He did not greet us, introduce himself, or even offer recommendations. He just asked us what we wanted then left.   I ordered the fish and my boyfriend ordered steak. He was pleased with the temperature of his steak, but my fish was completely raw. I had to wait another 15 minutes for my meal to be cooked while my boyfriend finished his.   When it was all said and done, it was a $200 meal for substandard food and service. I even told the manager how displeased I was and all he said was to contact a different manager and come back and try them again.   I work for a review site so I am willing to speak with someone on my concerns before posting a negative review online, but it was clear they get enough business and do not care how they treat guests of the hotel. Sad because with so many options in Vegas, I will be sure to let friends and colleagues who visit the Cosmo to definitely go to a different restaurant.",

We actually ordered 3 dishes of the tuna bc it was so good.   For the mains, people got the branzino, pasta, steak, lobster.

For entrees we ordered the short rib agnolotti and Pici pasta dishes. Both dishes were mediocre, the flavor didn't taste developed, and both were very bland. The highlights of the meal was the variety of tasty breads and the chocolate cake to end the meal!   Overall, there are plenty of delicious restaurants in Las Vegas... I do not recommend this one.",

I ordered the fried squid and it was also decent but the portion was very small. We shared a salad and shared our main entrees with our 7 year old since they don't offer kiddo menu. She wouldn't have been able to finish a meal by herself we thought so we shared but in light of the small portions she would've been just fine. It came to about 100 benjamins and we left feeling like we can still eat so we got dessert from the milk bar.

It's worth coming to Scarpetta just for this one dish ($24). If you're sharing it, they'll split into two perfect servings that are big enough to enjoy and small enough that you can still order other stuff.   I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Before you get to the spaghetti, enjoy the dark, modern, understated ambience. If you're lucky enough to be seated by the window, you'll be able to catch the Bellagio fountain water shows.   The bread basket they being is not your run-of-the-mill sort of deal. There's a serious assortment of delicious options (the rosemary focaccia is amazing!) served with mascarpone butter, eggplant caponata, and citrus-infused olive oil.   They have a nice selection of wine, including maybe a dozen options by the glass. Didn't have much experience with their cocktails, but the old fashioned that my husband ordered was way too sweet.   Besides the spaghetti, other menu highlights were the asparagus, which was cooked perfectly, with an egg yolk vinaigrette (hollandaise-esque, but not too heavy) and capers, and the creamy polenta with truffled mushroom fricasee--so flavorful and umami. The polenta was so loose it was a little difficult to eat without dripping all over, but the buttery mushroom goodness happening way more than made up for that shortcoming.",

LOCATION: It's located at The Cosmopolitan (where all the great restaurants seem to be).   ATMOSPHERE: The ambiance is romantic, lighting was dim and sexy, view of the bellagio fountains were breathtaking. Upscale and Trendy. Great for celebrations or a date night.   DRINKS & FOOD: We started with a bottle of champagne for the table while we enjoyed the variety of complimentary breads (the bacon and cheese was my fave). We were a group of 4, and shared all plates. For an appetizer we ordered the tuna crudo and yellowtail crudo. They plated it for us and the presentation was beautiful. The fish was melt in your mouth delicious and seasoned perfectly with just enough kick to wake up your taste buds. We ordered 2 plates of the spaghetti, split into 4 portions, the short rib/bone marrow agnolotti and the pici. All pasta dishes were cooked perfectly al dente. Accompanied by a bottle of Justin's Isosceles, which never disappoints. The spaghetti was simple but delicious - spaghetti noodles with tomato and basil. The short rib agnolotti is a mixture of short rib and bone marrow inside a flat agnolotti noodle (think mini cylinder raviolis). It's rich and savory. The pici pasta with lobster, tarragon, almond and chili pesto was by far everyone's favorite. It's a must order. We finished the night with some Nocello, an Italian black walnut liqueur. I'm not into dessert drinks but I will definitely be buying a bottle of this for home.   SERVICE: Service was outstanding. Our waiter made some great recommendations, our drinks were always full. And Noah, the sommelier? was very warm, welcoming and fun. He really made our night special.   Value: I'd say this is more of a 4-$$$$ restaurant, but well worth the $140 per person.",

Obviously I cant remember too much as it was after 9pm and we were off the plane, golfing and drinking before noon. I do know it was bomb, and I'm going back next vegas trip. I love quality Italian eats and this place was just that. Smaller portions, but that's standard at most upscale joints and I was Ok with that cause the quality was there!!

The bar is long and narrow. It is quite inviting and incredibly attractive. They have small alcoves that seat two on the right hand side that would make a wonderful place to come to have a romantic drink before your evening starts. The main dining room is also beautifully decorated. If you were lucky enough to get a seat by the window, you have a terrific you of the Bellagio fountains as well as looking down the Las Vegas Boulevard Strip. The tables are very nicely spaced so that you can have quiet conversation with the friends with whom you are dining and not be bothered by conversations from other tables.   Food: the meal starts with a small basket of breads placed on the center of the table. If it were possible to have a \"bread orgasm\",  then the four of us had that shared experience on eating the breads. Wow, it was that good! We decided we would share the Pici ( normally a main course) as an appetizer for the four of us. This dish was incredibly good. It consisted of a green pasta cooked al dante with a generous portion of lobster meat mixed in. The sauce was a bit spicy but it was delicious. I had the New York strip steak as my main course. The quality of the meat was really mediocre even though it was cooked appropriately. I expected it to be much better in a high end restaurant. It came with some vegetables that were delicious. In addition we ordered a side of mushrooms for the table. This too was incredibly delicious. We shared a chocolate cake for dessert. The chocolate cake was a rich dark chocolate with a small scoop of gelato on top. The cake made me feel as if I had died and gone to heaven. Service: while our waiter did nothing wrong, he certainly did nothing to make us feel welcome. The service runners brought the food in a timely fashion although it was a little surprising that they did not know who was supposed to get which dish. The bus boy was it quite good. Our water glasses never got below half full.",

We started with a delicious bread basket, it had a variety of Italian breads and the real treat was stromboli with prosciutto and smoked mozzarella. Citrus olive oil, butter with marscapone and eggplant & tomatoes accompanied the bread. I could've easily made a meal from this, but I ordered the creamy polenta to whet our appetite.  I've heard nothing but praises for this polenta. It was a beautiful dish. Luscious and full of truffle flavor, but it didn't leave me wanting more.   Next, we opted to skip the entrees and order selections from the secondini portion of the meal. Frank went with the Signature spaghetti. It's been featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" so it's hard to pass it up. I went with the duck and foie gras ravioli. It was the dish that made me lust over the restaurant for the past year.   The ravioli did not disappoint. It was the second best ravioli I've had to date. Mama Egi's ravioli over at Circo takes the cake. But this was very, very good. Well balanced and the raviolis seemed to melt on your tongue. The spaghetti was good, but hardly a best thing I ever ate. I enjoyed the simplicity of it, the al dente noodle, but $26 spaghetti should knock my socks off, it did not.   We weren't overly stuffed so we took a gander at the dessert menu and quickly chose zeppole for dessert.  Now, this was special! I'm not fond of dessert oozing with sweetness. This bordered on savory and I love it. These little pillowy bites were filled with nutella and topped with candied hazelnuts. There was a creme anglaise for dipping. It was a perfect end to the meal.   Service was very good throughout. Our server, Luis, was helpful and he made certain we did not go thirsty. Fresh iced teas were plentiful. The meal set us back $92. Pretty good considering one could easily spend an arm and leg here.",

Its worth a try, but I won't be a regular here and it probably won't be a place that I suggest to go to.  The food is decent and good, but I've been so many other great restaurants with excellent food at a lower price point.  Overall, good food but overpriced.",

The wooden floors, leather chairs, and leather placemats gave an instant upscale but hip vibe. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, a meat dish, a side, and a dessert. All handmade pastas, the chef was so kind and split all our dishes (even when we said it wasn't a big deal for us to eat family style), and the spaghetti was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The spaghetti with tomato and basil was so good we got an extra order to eat later. Luis, our server, was incredibly accommodating and made sure our dining experience was unforgettable. He joked with us, told us each item we were about to eat, and sent us home happy customers.",

    "text": "I took my wife here for her 40th Birthday and they knew we were coming and the reason.   This was our first time here. We arrived minutes after 9PM.  The restaurant was dimly lit. The atmosphere was LOUD. Nothing romantic about this setting at all.   HOSTESS  Her greeting was like listening to an answering machine. We had a 9:30 reservation (90 min before closing) and got sat in front of a pillar. I could not see the Bellagio fountains that seems to influence everybody's reviews. About 20 min later, 2 tables opened up that were right against the glass. In my reservation I let them know it was a special occasion.   SERVER  Like the hostess, it was like watching blue man group after 3 straight performances.   Just going through the motions.   We were not interested in cocktails or wine, but were focused on some great cuisine. The server did stop once to go over the menu, but all he did was say \"these are the apps, these are the pastas, these are the main courses\" etc. etc. They must get a lot of people who never viewed a menu before.   We ordered the Misto fritto, Farmers salad, Fennel Black Cod, and wrapped Veal loin. (I did not take any pictures this time, I did not want my review to be a distraction of the occasion)   FOOD  My wife loved the complimentary bread which included dippers of olive oil, roasted eggplant and tomatoes, and truffle butter. The bread was varieties of an Italian Sourdough, foccacia, stromboli, and a vegetable stromboli.   They automatically split our app & salad which I appreciated.   MISTO FRITTO  The menu description was very vague, but I figured it had to be a spin off of fried calamari. Tempura battered squid, white anchovies, cauliflower, and the stems of chives. There were no anchovies in my plate, and happened to be my wife's first bite on her's which she did not like at all. I would not have known about the anchovies (which I love) if I did not finish her plate. The fry was perfect, and I really liked the seasoning which included rosemary.   FARMERS SALAD  The presentation was beautiful. Some of the vegetables (green & yellow squash) were almost shaved. It was a nice salad, but not much flavor. There were only 2 choices of salad on the menu and I chose this one. My wife ate only half of hers.   VEAL LOIN  There is a picture of this dish in the archives. 3 (2oz?) wrapped pieces of veal perfectly cooked. A few pieces of carrots and another vegetable. I tasted some sort of mustard on this dish with another sauce. The menu (again) was VERY vague. As I ate, I was wondering what the expense was in making this dish that carried a $38 price.   BLACK COD  Presentation was standard, Looked to be about a 5oz filet. My wife was half way through her dish without a sound. Knowing my wife, this means she did not want to disappoint me in saying she did not care for it. I tried a bite and thought it was weird for Cod to be so mushy. It was not pleasant at all. Maybe even undercooked.  My wife at all the vegetables and there was half of the filet sitting alone on the plate when the busser took it away. Sad that no one noticed that half of what was supposed to be the hero of this dish was being tossed out like a used tissue.   We passed on dessert because to me, dessert should be the perfect finish to a perfect meal which this whole experience was not. My wife liked the complimentary bread the best and I liked the Fritto Misto the best. There was some woman in a very loud group making noises that reminded me of farm animals in heat.   It shouldn't be this way in a restaurant of this price point.     I asked for the check (1app, 1 salad, 2 entrees) $116.00   As we were getting up to leave, a person came by with a dish that said happy birthday and had 2 biscotti\"s , a cookie, a salted chocolate thingy and a lit candle.  Would have went better with a cappuccino but the check was already paid.   This was a disappointing experience, even more so because I wanted it to be special for my wife's 40th. She liked the complimentary bread.....  If I can say something positive and relative, I would recommend going to D.O.C G. instead. Same Chef, different menu. Been there 5 times and loved it.",

Not really the way I imagined myself dining for the first time at the famous Scarpetta, but hey, at least I was ready to eat.  We crawled in in our flip flops and denim shorts right when the restaurant opened. The tables were already all booked (at 6pm!), but they have some nice booth seats by the bar.   First off, the complimentary bread. My god. Warm and chewy, stuffed with sausage or spinach and cheese, with olive oil for dipping. We had to get a second round of this, it was so fantastic.   We also shared four pastas: - spaghetti (with tomato and basil, that's it!) - duck & foie gras ravioli - pici (with lobster, tarragon, almond & chili pesto) - short rib & bone marrow agnolotti (the toasted breadcrumbs added such a fabulous texture and crunch!)  All the dishes were phenomenal, but the spaghetti was by far my favorite. Typically spaghetti doesn't do it for me, but now that I know what it's supposed to taste like, I've changed my mind. So simple, yet so delicious. It was cooked perfectly al dente, and so rich and full of flavor I didn't even miss the creaminess (or cheesiness) of other pastas.   A MUST-VISIT IF YOU'RE EVER IN VEGAS!",

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype in our visit. My friend has a few food allergies. Their gluten-free menu was a great help, but we had asked for her to be contacted by the restaurant beforehand to verify that she would be able to eat there. She didn't need anything crazy, just a confirmation that very simple things could be accommodated. Things that have been easily done by Red Robin and other chains. Easy stuff. They called her an hour before our reservation and spoke for about 30 minutes.She was assured that the waiter would be notified of her needs and that her requests could easily be honored. Great!  We get there and are seated right away (despite being a little late due to traffic) but our waiter knew nothing about the conversation that had taken place just 30 minutes before. He went to talk to the hostess and everyone played dumb all around. Despite her requests being quite simple and her efforts to be an easy customer, we were made to feel like a great big hassle to everyone.   We split the raw yellowtail app and they messed up hers but quickly fixed it. It was so delicious though incredibly tiny even if we hadn't split the portion! There was a long delay for our entrees and the chef sent out a free salad during the wait. They also messed that up but fixed it. My friend had the black cod and I had the short rib angolotti. The cod was again a very small portion. The angolotti was a generous portion, especially given the richness. It was very good but we felt it overpriced for portion and quality, even for Vegas.  I had asked for my remaining angolotti (about 2/3 of my serving, so a large amount) to be boxed up to take with me and not 5 seconds after the waiter had acknowledged my request, he stacked a bunch of plates on top of my plate and walked off, thus ruining my leftovers. I watched him to make sure he wouldn't unstack the plates and scrape off my food into a box. Luckily he did not. My annoyance was high and we had a show to attend so I decided to not make a fuss and just let it go.  My friend and I have eaten out many times at many different types of places with a variety of price points. This was the worst in terms of service at this type of restaurant. The food was ok. Maybe it was an off night, who knows. I wouldn't waste my time or money here again when we come back to Vegas.",

The scallop and spaghetti were both so yummy! The noodle was slightly too al dente for me, but the sauce was so amazing. The Duck Foie Gras Ravioli had a strong foie gras taste to it. I couldn't really taste the duck. My least favorite of the night had to be the veal dish. The meat was dry and very lackluster.  The most amazing thing was the bread basket. It comes with a variety of dips and breads. There is one warm bread with salami embedded in the inside. I wish I have a whole basket of that!  Anywho, I would definitely come back for the bread and to try the spaghetti again. :)",

    "text": "High quality food delivered very poorly.  This restaurant came recommended by a foodie friend I trust. After eating at a lot of great places on the strip, I had high expectations. My friend got the food right but our overall experience was greatly lacking.  After explaining to our server that we had no other places to be, I expected a slow, thoughtful dinner where we could savor each course. Rather it felt like the staff was trying to flip the table. Everyone in our party of four felt like the food was being served without passion. A full course meal for four was served and eaten in about an hour. I was hoping for at least a relaxing two-hour dinner.   The food itself was quite good--not the best we've had on our trip to Vegas--but delightful. The price we paid seemed a bit on the high side for the quality of food but for the most part seemed appropriate. The foie gras ravioli is a must do.  Our server was polite but inattentive. One drink we ordered (mine) failed to make it to the table--an honest enough mistake as these oversights can happen now and then. However the server failed to notice and not once throughout the entire meal checked on drinks. I completed my meal without ever getting a beverage. When I was charged for the drink and the error was called out, the server made no effort to make it right.  The support staff was overly attentive. Empty plates were cleared promptly. However my unfinished main dish was almost taken twice before I was finished. I had to stop the food from being cleared before I was done enjoying it. Again, it seemed like they were trying to flip the table. One of the support staff also topped my unfinished sparkling water with tap.  Plate prices are on the high side and the many missteps were inconsistent with the quality I expected. There are myriad great places to eat in Vegas and service is a key differentiator. You can find better, more unique food to enliven your palate and, based on our time there, more invested humans to help you experience it.",

    "text": "We visited here during a recent weekend to celebrate my brother's 30th birthday.  As we had planned poorly and did not make reservations, it was excellent that this restaurant had a high table available in the bar area for immediate seating.  Drinks - most of us went with Old Fashioned (various bourbons) and service was prompt and correct every time.  Food - most of us ate pretty light as it was our first night in Vegas, but there were a few notable items: 1.  The bread selection was amazing!  The different selections and butter/oil to pair was great. 2.  The duck fois gras was amazing!  Great taste while not overpowering everything else.     Our experience was great, but the billing (covering for my brother on his birthday) caused quite the confusion when billing everything out.  The receipts almost needed an accounting expert to discern, but everything ended up correct in the end.  Overall 4 stars with a NEAR higher rating.  I had seen that some were able to get a tour of the kitchen, but it did not appear this was in the cards for us tonight!  Maybe next time.",

    "text": "This place left such an impact that I almost went back to my room to write a Yelp! OMG I just finished writing and realize no one in their right mind will ever read this- it's an essay!  Just got back from an impromptu b-day trip from Las Vegas. Had an amazing time w the guy and the memorable meal of the trip was a b-day dinner at Scarpetta- great recommendation from a friend.  Everything here is phenomenal but I want to start w the service. Mathew our server,  was cordial, friendly & extremely informative. The table next door said he was Captain Morgan come to life but he reminded us of a younger refined Gary Oldman mixed w someone else. :)  One thing I really appreciate in any server is someone that shares their experiences w various dishes and points you in the direction you want to go. We filled him in on the 3 dishes we knew we wanted and he put real thought into helping us choose the final dish. Not only that, he was exceptionally personable; and we had great small talk- always love that.  Alright to the review and apologize in advance for the blabbering!  To Start:  An unassuming covered basket of bread is left on the table. On the outside is an inconspicuous piece of sliced sourdough on top... nothing special right? I'm thinking \"PASS trying to cut carbs!\" Surprise!!! 2 types of STROMBOLI (I believe it was Pesto/Cheese and Salami or a Tasso Ham and Cheese) and fresh rosemary cibatta inside. Proceed to annihilate entire basket.  We ended up sharing everything we ordered so they portioned out everything for us, it was perfect and presentation was beautiful.   Starters: Vancouver Island Oysters: Fresh Oysters, enough said.  Dungeness Crab and White Corn Soup: My rule of thumb is to always order soup if it's on the menu and isn't a house soup. I've been unsuccessful in making a solid corn soup, leave it to the professionals I say! This was the perfect, hot, super creamy, flavor filled soup I wish to one day master. The corn scent wafted into your nose as the base was poured over the  chunks of crab, table side. I definitely conjured Toucan Sam (corn soup version) for a second.  Pici: (pronounced peachy like the folders)  Homemade pasta sort of like a thicker fettuccine noodle on steroids. Parsley and other goodies are blended in the flour which adds a green hue and extra umph. It comes w lobster and a taragon, almond and chili pesto. I'm not a huge pesto fan but luckily for me it's not a traditional pesto; it's not even a sauce. They give you the perfect amount to coat but not over power the dish and it has a serious kick. Very generous portion of lobster, and a staple at the restaurant. MUST TRY IT.  KOBE BEEF RIB CAP: This was $68, on our last trip to Vegas we had the Japanese Waygu at Cut which I think has permanently changed my views on the price of steak. This was 7 oz and extremely rich, barely needed a knife, and it just melted in your mouth. It came w potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms & a reduction that is seriously making my mouth water in retrospect.  Peach Costata: Salted Shortbread covered w Cardamon ice cream and chunks of peach. It was a spicy dessert (take note if that's not your thing) that complimented our decaf cappuccino's! The decaf cap's were suggested by Mathew when we originally ordered just decaf coffee. Great suggestion, paired perfect w the dessert.  Oh MAN 2 things I left out-  I had a dirty martini w blue cheese filled olives; holy goodness; i hope i can order this at other places.  Lastly; we were here on the 4th of July; right when we were paying Mathew mentioned we could wait because the fireworks at Caesar's were starting in 10 minutes. They allowed us to stay and watch for 30+ mins (late start) even though the restaurant was filling up. I thought that was really nice of them (they didn't even know it was my bday!) haha and there was no rush to get us out the door.  Taking into account service, ambiance and quality I put this in my top 3 best dining experiences ever :) also you can  tell I loved the service considering I mentioned the server by name 3x in the post!? Foie Gras Ravioli, you're next!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars  Came here for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and booked weeks in advance. We were greeted at the door and congratulated by the host, which was very nice.   We were then escorted to the worst table in the house: a wobbly 4 top table in between 4 large parties of business men, where we couldn't hear each other talk. We were also given nasty looks when we asked for a booth away from the crowd seating.   The food overall was 4 stars. The spaghetti and lobster picci were cooked al dente and were enjoyable, with perfect portions. The added meatballs were $8 for tiny bits over over cooked, tougher beef- we recommended skipping those.   Drinks were average price for white table cloth dining, and were made very stiff. No disappointment here.   Dessert options looked great, and we opted for the bomboloni's after seeing other Yelp reviews. They were just \"ok\". Even fried doughnuts with barely any filling inside, which ended up making us both sick later that evening.   Overall we give this place 3.5-4 stars. Worth a try if you want fine dining Italian food when in Vegas, but nothing exciting and certainly not a \"must visit\" venue. We tried it, and don't feel the need to return.",

    "text": "This place is ridiculously pricey for what it is. The menu is small and simple, so every dish feels somewhat unjustified. We tried the spaghetti, which was super plain - literally just noodles, a light tomato sauce, and some basil. Granted, it was well-made, as the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. But seriously...I don't think anyone should have to pay close to $20 for a mere plate of noodles, especially one that doesn't even have protein. We also tried a short rib dish in an attempt to get in some protein, but the portion size was laughable and the short ribs weren't even that good. I've had much better short ribs at other New American restaurants before. Had we not been staying at The Cosmo, I definitely would have gone elsewhere for my Italian fix instead, considering how expensive and just whatevers this place is. Do yourself a favor and skip it!",

Every single foodie I know has recommended his very simple yet delicious spaghetti dish to me. So, we ordered it as an appetizer and BOY were we disappointed. The taste was wonderful but the pasta wasn't cooked right (Ironic I know since he dings people on this very issue).   We told the server our pasta was a lil too al dente and he quickly corrected me that fresh pasta can't be al dente. I continued to clarify that its a big tough in the center and doesn't taste like its cooked all the way through. I completely understand that pasta should still have a touch bite to it but this was practically raw on the inside. Like I said before I REALLY wanted to love this dish and the server made me feel really stupid for not \"getting\" how pasta should be cooked. The restaurant took the spaghetti off our bill which was really nice but I wish they'd offer us a redo of the dish.   Regardless, I haven't given up hope just yet. Every restaurant (even awesome ones) can have an OFF day. I do wish the server was a bit more understanding but what-ya gonna do right? Anyways, hope to try Scarpetta again and LOVE the spaghetti.",

Pasta is made fresh, so be patient for your meal. I was disappointed at first with them only having one vegetarian option (spaghetti) but it was great so I'm glad it worked out. I'm sure if I told them my food choice concern, they would have offered to make substitutions but I just didn't want to go through the drama that night.",

It is one of my favorite places in LA and I figured I couldn't go wrong at their Las Vegas location.  They exceeded expectations.  I made reservations for 7 on opentable and due to a very long taxi line at our hotel we were running a bit late, I called them and they were kind to let me know that they would seat us when we arrive and not to worry.  Dinner was remarkable per usual as was the excellent service.  They were aware of our celebration and the staff made sure to congratulate our bride personally and with a desert! The waiter and his crew were extremely friendly and before we knew it 2 hrs had passed us by and we left happy and very full. I cant wait to go back!  What we ordered: Farmer's Market Salad Crispy Fritto Misto  Creamy Polenta - AMAZING Roasted Diver Scallops Braised Short Ribs of Beef Spaghetti - 4 out of 7 of us ordered this dish and all of us finished the entire bowl Fettuccine  - If youre going to order the pasta dont be foolish order SPAGHETTI Prime Filet of Beef - amazing!  The drinks were also delicious! The lemon drop martini and shots especially.",

We walked in and we had a reservation so we were seated promptly right by the window and we could see The Bellagio fountain. It was so romantic.   We ordered wine (I don't remember which one) but it was amazing. For our starter we got The Yellowtail and The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. Both were spectacular.   For dinner Handsome ordered The Veal Three ways and I ordered The Pan Roasted Halibut. Handsome loved his veal and my halibut melted in my mouth.  For dessert we orders the Rhubarb Souffle and I think that was Handsome's favorite part. It was so light and fluffy with such a delicious flavor.

    "text": "Owner Scott Conant (the dude from Chopped) hates raw onions. Therefore, I don't trust him... half kidding  I think Scarpetta is more like 4 stars, but I knocked off a star because our party definitely felt a little sick after eating here. Maybe it was an off day (we think it's from the cheese in the potatoes of a side dish).  Undeniably a beautiful spot to eat. The large windows display the neighboring Bellagio water fountain show, where my girlfriends and I packed into one side of the booth, so we could watch and eat at the same time.  Oysters West Coast - good, fresh raw oysters. I loved the horseradish sauce that came with it, and a gravy boat of tabasco was brought to us upon request  Stracci - a flat noodle pasta with lobster, crab, shrimp. There were generous portions of seafood and the pasta and tasted creamy/good.  Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I actually have to go against the hype to say that it was just okay, and not that great. The dish was a tad bit colder than luke warm, and just the richness of the foie gras/drier duck made it hard to finish the whole dish. Maybe a couple bites and I was pretty much done with it :-P  Black Cod - So soft and melted in my mouth (I think I ate a cloud..).   Ribeye of Beef 24 oz - For $62, this had better been some good ribeye. Although I know that Scarpetta doesn't specialize in steak, I thought it was a bit overpriced for it being standard and nothing special.  Even though it was medium-rare, the steak was still a tad tough.  **don't fill up on the bread** Scarpetta has fantastic bread. The bread basket had 3-4 different kinds of breads, one of them being a melted roll of salami and cheese (a meal itself). And the bread came with mascarpone butter (LOVE), eggplant dip, and olive oil  One of the better restaurants in the Cosmo. Did anybody realize the restaurants in the City Center area (Cosmopolitan, Vdara, Aria) are not that great? Hmmm",

The flavors were incredible and well balanced. Not to mention the portions were great for the price. The views are amazing (ask to sit by window). Ambience is romantic and sexy. I would recommend you come here. It did not disappoint.",

    "text": "Well, we had a nice dinner but after eating at STK the night before, Scarpetta let me down a little. The bar is somewhat awkward, more like a long hallway with a slight \"walk of shame\" ambiance to it.  We were seated at our table - it is a beautiful room. The bread is good but I'm not sure why some of it was cut up stromboli slices.  Hell, we are from Philly but it's very filling before dinner. The oysters were absolutely delicious!!! The best dish we ordered without a doubt!   Our waiter then expanded our table by lifting the sides on our square table making it a larger round table to make room for our entrees.  Unfortunately, on my side there was a huge glob of chewed gum that became visible when the waiter lifted my partition.  This was not my waiter's fault but it was still gross.  Of course, my waiter quickly worked on removing the gum but yuck! That's Vegas for you!  My husband and I both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Both dishes were warm not has hot has I like.  It was OK.  I'm kind of a pasta snob (Thanks Babbo) Our friends felt the same about their pasta dishes, it was OK  Not mind blowing. We ordered two bottles of Cline wine - can't go wrong there! Dessert was good but still not out of the park. Our bill for 4 people was about $800.  Now for 4 people in Vegas, this is the norm but this night, I don't think it was worth it. I know a lot of people LOVE this place, maybe it was just an off night.",

It had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains by the window. Our server explained the menu to us and brought out some delicious bread too. Their rosemary one is very savory. I got the Pici which had a nice texture and a bountiful amount of lobster. Worth the price. It had a bit of a spice to it too. But oh goodness I tried a bite of my friend's pork chop and I'm obsessed. It was tender and fall off the bone good. Even the pairing of vegetables like charred fruit that was on the side was divine. I also tried my friends duck and it was very well cooked. Will definitely be trying a protein dish there the next time I go back. Only 4/5 though because I wanted to bring in a dessert but they said they would charge $7.50 per person for a cake cutting fee. I get that it's the strip but that's overdoing it a bit.",

(I had reservations too) Servers kept looking at me and it was almost 10pm so not a super packed house.  No apology for the wait, and especially dining alone, they should have at least given me a menu or some water. I would have left if it hit the 10 minute mark but I was here for the food.  The food definitely delivers, and it was some of the best pasta I have ever had and reminded me of my time in Italy. The flavor of the pasta took me back. I had the short rib - bone marrow agnolotti. The crunch on top made the entire dish that much better.  Also order the diver scallops with foie gras. Very rich, but the marriage of flavors works beautifully.   Nutella and vanilla bomboloni -with banana ice cream. Yup. It's good. It's really good.   I give this location a 4.5/5 stars.",

Both were amazing but the Polenta was the best I'd ever had. The bread basket was also unbelievable.  For entrees, we each had the Spaghetti, which was simple yet somehow unbelievably tasty.  We also shared the filet, which was perfectly seasoned and prepared.  Lastly, we had the Banana Souffle which was out of this world.  In all, the food was among the best Italian dinners that I've had.  Why 4 stars?  The wine menu, while long, has no affordable choices.  We struggled to find a bottle of red under $100, which I think is ridiculous when there are so many amazing affordable wines at cheaper price points.",

I've been itching to try out Scarpetta for a while and made it a priority during my Vegas trip!!  OMG!  Everything was bad.  I mean bad!!! The service was bad and lacking and the food didn't save the day either.  Let's just say I'd expected much more from you and maybe a meal at Olive Garden would've been a better choice. There was absolutely no seasoning in all of the dishes and the focaccia bread was drowned in oil.  The saving grace is probably your specialty bread.    We ordered the short rib agnolotti and fritto misto as appetizers and both were mediocre at best.  For entrees I ordered the duck and fois gras ravioli and omg, I couldn't eat more than 4 pieces of it and I'm known to polish my plates.  My hubby had the octopus and it was ok but lacked seasoning again.  My daughter had your world famous tomato sauce pasta and the pasta was tough and needed salt!  Is it a bad day or is it normally like this?  Hands down the worst meal in Vegas.  HUGE disappointment!!!",

    "text": "Just wow. My new favorite place to dine in Vegas. Super swanky interior. The lights were dim and the crowd was pretty quiet when we went Friday night. Perfect after nursing a hangover all afternoon.  The basket of bread was thoroughly enjoyed by all at the table. It was accompanie breadd with marinated eggplant tapenade, evoo, and some whipped butter. Some had prosciutto and cheese marbled in them.  To start, the Kumamoto oysters were fresh and light. The cocktail sauce and mingionette were both great. We also had the grilled prawn and diver scallop with foie gras. They portioned it out for all of us so that was really nice. The vegetables in both appetizers were very well done. Everything paired nicely. We also had the uni, crab, tobiko capellini which was just ok. When you hear uni the expectation bar is set pretty high...  For my entree I had the famous spaghetti which I enjoyed. The fresh tomato and basil flavors were well balanced and the pasta wasn't too al dente which I like. My bf had the black cod. I thought it was ok, nothing special.  To end the meal, we had the bomboloni, recommended by our server. I'm glad my party didn't skip on dessert, because it was SO GOOD. The freshly fried Nutella filled donut ball was perfect paired with the light banana gelato. I'm typically not a huge fan of heavy fried desserts...but man oh man...with that gelato it was to die for.  Overall, food and service was excellent. Of course it cost a pretty penny, but what do you expect in Vegas? Definitely recommend Scarpetta if you are looking for some tasty eats.",

I'm not a mushroom lover and I was scraping the bowl for every last drop of polenta. The agnolotti was something I could eat for every meal happily.   The best part was the bill. We ordered a lot. Everyone had an appetizer and an entree and there were several mixed drinks and it was way cheaper than I expected.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I spent our Thanksgiving holiday in Vegas with our respective families.  The original plan for Thanksgiving dinner was to go to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet, but since we were staying at the Cosmopolitan, the logistics of getting the family together there scrapped that Plan A.  Plan B was to go to the Cosmo's Wicked Spoon Buffet, but the three-hour plus wait resulted in us scrapping that one, too.  As a result, we made our way to Scarpetta since everyone likes Italian (right?) and they could accommodate our party of eight without reservations at 6:30 pm on Thanksgiving Day for dinner.  By this point, we were just happy that we found someplace...anyplace...for dinner.    We were seated in a nice, small, private room looking out over the Bellagio's fountains to the north.  Matthew, our server, was exceedingly professional and knowledgeable about the menu, offering spot on food and drink recommendations.  We started off with drinks while we looked over the menu.  I had the Billionaire ($16) made with Elijah Craig, pomegranate syrup, Pernod Absinthe, and lemon juice.  Frankly, the cocktail was well made and pleasing, however, for the price, I wasn't impressed with the choice of Elijah Craig as the base spirit unless it was for their 18 or 20 year old stuff.  Of course, since they didn't specify, I assumed it was for the standard 12 year old bourbon.  For starters, the table shared an order of Crispy Fritto Misto consisting of seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon ($18) and an order of Creamy Polenta topped with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms ($17).  All elements of the fritto misto were fried to perfection, crispy, without a hint of sogginess, leaving the mix of shrimp, calamari and octopus tender.  I like polenta.  The polenta was creamy as advertised and as good a polenta as I've ever had.  That said, it was $17 for polenta...a bit pricey.  Chef Scott Conant and his Scarpetta are known for its fresh made pastas, so for my main course, I had the Pici, a thick, spaghetti-like pasta, with lobster, preserved tangerine & bottarga ($36). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#qPDstnGpczl7IsR5MB4p5g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>  I'd never had pici before and it was a hearty, filling pasta.  It was tossed with restraint with what I'm assuming was only olive oil, the preserved tangerine, bottarga (a dried, pressed fish roe), and tender chunks of lobster claw meat.  The pasta dish was outstanding as the flavor profile and aromatics of each ingredient were present and in perfect balance.  While it was one seriously pricey bowl of pasta, it tasted like it was worth every bite as it hit my tongue.  The gf and I split a side of roasted mushrooms consisting of trumpet royale, beech, and shitake mushrooms, topped with pecorino and trucioleto vinegar ($11) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ#EmJ-zvY2Ihq8gwDluU6IPQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>  It was a nice plate of fungus and excellent complement to my pasta.   Scarpetta may not have been our first choice for Thanksgiving dinner, but it was definitely a good choice.  The food was well-executed and delivered amazing flavor.  Service was attentive without any hint of intrusiveness.  The only downside was that it was quite expensive and some items seemed overpriced for what was received.  Still, Scarpetta is a fine restaurant and perfect for a special occasion...even Thanksgiving dinner.",

    "text": "Very tasty w/ Italian roots  I won't say that Scarpetta is exclusively Italian cuisine, but all the basics are there for quality dining with some very nice views of the fountains outside. Service is top notch with emphasis on your experience being 100%.   Food quality was exceptional for the money, bar-none. A wide variety of flavor choices for most folks, and some more common choices for the simpler people. Nothing was overspiced as I had become accustomed to at high-end Italian places, which was nice.  Seafood was nice w/ great accompanying vegetables (marinated cherry tomatoes are amazing). Breads w/ prosciutto were impeccable as an appetizer, and the wine selection was pretty damned good (it helps that their wine cooler-thingy is a clear wall).   I would definitely return when back in Vegas. It also helps that you see some fairly well-known entertainers eat here, which is a decent sign of quality.",

    "text": "\"This was a great meal\"  If you want food that is prepared to very high standards and is of utmost quality this is one great place to dine in Vegas. I had the beet salad, the pasta with tomatoes sauce (a must try), the branzino and the panna cotta. The beet salad was fresh and paired very well with the cheese they had in it. Scott Conant, the chef, is on TV always complaining about how everyone cooks their pasta and guess what? He has legs to stand on! His (well his chef's) was absolutely perfect! The branzino was very good but not as memorable as the other dishes.  Since the the other dishes were so good, I decided that I could not leave without desert. I had the panna cotta which in my opinion is a must have while in Vegas. Even if you have dinner near by and want to stop in for a coffee and desert, have the panna cotta. Its out of this world and if I was not so full I would have had two!!",

It complemented my duck foie gras ravioli really well.  The ravioli was not as good at the polenta.  I thought the skin was too thin, and the filling not substantial enough.  It was a smooth, light filling but I was left hungry after finishing it.  I probably should have gotten the other ravioli dish.  For dessert, the panna cotta with guava sauce and pineapples was a refreshing way to end the meal.",

Have to admit thought it was rather bold of the dude to suggest the spaghetti as the pasta to try. But it was very good, al dente handmade noodles with the right balance of sweet and acidity of the tomato & basil sauce.   Also the field greens was rather good even though it wasn't listed on the menu. There is a smear of some kind of nut butter, candied walnut and uber fresh greens with light vinaigrette salad.",

I was a little annoyed by having to wait, especially that late, but we ended up with a table that overlooked the Bellagio fountain so that was nice.  As everyone else has said, the portions are smaller than what people are used to but I actually liked that as my friend and I were able to split an app, and then each order an entree and split an additional entree as a middle course. The middle course was the spaghetti as we had heard good things, however we didn't find it to be anything special and it came out luke warm. However, we also had the Creamy Polenta, Stracci, and Black Farfalle which were all amazing!",

We arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat right away. We were given a table by the window which allowed us to enjoy the Bellagio fountain show (about three times during our meal!). The wait staff was attentive and very nice. They offered advice about portion size and house favorites. Bread is served as you are seated, and it was delicious and fresh. The bread basket even includes Stromboli! Yum! We ordered a bottle of wine - a very good selection to chose from. My husband ordered the duck, and I got the short rib agnolotti with a side of broccoli rabe to share. Both meals were amazing! The atmosphere was modern yet casual. It felt sophisticated but comfortable. We will definitely be recommending to family and friends!",

We also had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain. The waiter was attentive, but not over-bearing and the sommelier's recommendation were very on spot.   The food was fantastic. I highly recommend the wagyu tar-tar as an appetizer. Pasta and meats were all cooked perfectly. And for Vegas, the prices are very reasonable. A great experience all around. I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "This review is based on a dinner visit.  Atmosphere - 4.5:  From the entrance it's a little difficult to get a sense of the restaurant because you can only see the long bar which you must walk through to get to the main seating area of the restaurant.  I initially thought it was an extension of the DOCG Enoteca, which is next door.  Once you reach the main seating area you will find a nicely decorated dining room that features views of the Bellagio fountains in one direction, and their extensive wine cellar in the opposite direction.  Menu - 4.5:  Great menu with very creative options.  The portions are small and the staff is really good about helping ensure you get the right amount of food.  Of course, as with many fine dining experiences you will pay for it if you are a big eater.  Service - 3:  The service was mixed.  The sommelier was fantastic; he really knew the vast wine collection and helped us find something that paired well with our group's diverse menu choices.  Our waiter, while very friendly, was just way too slow.  It took too long for everything from taking our order to getting our food.   Food delivery timing was off as one member of our group ended up watching everyone else eat while he waited.  I will say that it didn't appear that the other people in the restaurant were having the same experience.  I really think that our experience was out of the norm for some reason.  While I can't in good conscience rate the service experience any higher than 3, I would note that in my experience an establishment with a reputation for good service will usually do things to make amends when they don't deliver.  The restaurant recognized that things had not gone well for our table and took a few items off of our bill to compensate.  Food - 5:  The food was fantastic.  Especially liked the creamy truffle polenta.     Wine List - 5:  The 3,000+ bottle cellar offered plenty of choices.  The sommelier was very knowledgeable, friendly, and didn't make me feel like an idiot.    Overall - 4",

Our drinks come out and right away it doesn't taste like Moscato. I gave it a few more sips and realized, it's Prosecco! Now at this point I should have said something but I figured I'd already had too much to have it sent back. I was very let down by that. The other negative was the halibut said $38 on the menu but we were charged $40. If the menu is incorrect I think it's high time it's updated. Dessert menu was also wrong. The gelato with the lava cake was supposed to be amaretto but it was stracciatella. I liked it but it's misleading.  The vegetable pasta was delicious as was the halibut. The chocolate cake tasted delicious but was a tad over cooked. We had a nice view by the window. The menu is where all the problems were.",

    "text": "Three words. Foie Gras Ravioli.   I was saddened to learn that Scarpetta closed down their Los Angeles location. However, my spirits were finally lifted when I had the opportunity to dine at Scarpetta in Las Vegas for my friend's bachelorette party. I had only heard good things about their Duck Foie Gras Ravioli, which is exactly what I came for. If you've never had handmade pasta from Scarpetta before, trust me when I say you will taste the difference. Although I wished the foie gras flavor came through a little stronger in this dish, the texture of this pasta and its delicious sauce definitely made up for it.   Since we had a large party, we also got to sample each other's dishes. When we asked our waiter what the restaurant's most popular dish was, he named the Spaghetti which surprised us at first. Guys, have a taste and you will see why. So getting that next time I come here!   Other notables are their bread basket, which we did go through a few at our table! There were around 5 different kinds of breads, some of them yeasty while others were nice and cheesy along with mascapone butter, eggplant capanota and lemon olive oil for dipping.",

    "text": "Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with ANY restaurant in Cosmo. I've been to 3 so far and each one has been phenomenal. My friends and I decided to give Scarpetta a try since it's Restaurant Week!   Scarpetta is an Italian restaurant that is located on the 3rd level of Cosmo. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which makes it great date spot. It's also pretty dark and romantical in there too. If you're coming here for a date, definitely ask for window seats.   Onto the food!  Appetizers:      - Braised short rib with vegetable and farro risotto: this was delicious! The short rib is sliced (instead of the chunky ones I'm used to seeing) and the risotto was super creamy      - Creamy polenta with truffle mushrooms: this was a amazing! I love anything with truffle and if I didn't know may better, I would've thought the polenta was mashed potatoes because it was so creamy!  Entrees:       - Prime filet of beef with Swiss chard and barolo: I got this medium well and I absolutely loved it. The steak was juicy and paired well with the swiss chard       - Spaghetti with tomato and basil: cooked al dente, sauce was perfect. However, this wouldn't be something I'd get again mainly because I need some sort of meat in my meals  Dessert:      - Nutella bombolini: Fried dough rolled in sugar. Reminded me of Chinese fried donuts but with Nutella inside. This was good but wasn't my favorite.       - Amedei chocolate cake: definitely hits the chocolate spot. It's more of a dark chocolate cake which is my kind of jam!      - Mascarpone cheesecake: my favorite! It was so smooth and not overly sweet. I ate the whole thing!   Since it's Restaurant Week, this 3-course meal was $50 which is totally worth it in my opinion. Just go with someone so you can share multiple things on the menu :)",

Whenever possible, I order homemade pasta and last night was no exception. I had the Al Ceppo, which has house-made sausage, porcini, and lots salty olives. So good!! My husband had the veal Chop Parmigiano, and it was outstanding! The bone-in chop was tender and crispy with just the right amount of sauce and buratta.  We were too full for dessert, but the selection looked great.   If you're looking for a romantic date spot, I would highly recommend Scarpetta.",

    "text": "THE HYPE IS REAL!   TL;DR: must try: creamy polenta with truffles mushroom; spaghetti and the mascarpone cheesecake.   We went during the restaurant week and everything was SO good! If I'm stranded on an island and can only eat one thing for the rest of my life, I'd pick that polenta. The cheesecake was made from mascarpone, so it's not heavy like the New York cheesecake but A LOT smoother and creamier. In fact, probably the smoothest and creamiest I've ever had.   I also love the design of the restaurant. Intimate, not too loud, has a glass wall facing the Bellagio fountain show and seemingly much larger tables than other fine dining places (lol). I also noticed a couple semi-private rooms for larger groups and events.  Edits: almost forgot about the bread basket. They had like 6 different breads with all kinds of flavors and textures. Never thought that I would be craving for some broccoli bread.",

This place did not disappoint. Started out with the different breads and each one was delicious along with the spreads. My girlfriend had the spaghetti and I had the Short Rib Agnolotti. We shared as usual, and both were amazing in there own way. Though I do have to give an edge to the Agnolotti as I have never had anything like it before. Full of taste in every bite. The service was excellent, wine was a great pair, and the view made it the perfect anniversary dinner.",

If you look down there's things that you don't want to see you.  The waiter's name was Jason and he was just OK for me. He was a bit too serious & not friendly enough. We ordered the risotto, calamari & the scallops to start. He said he was going to split them and I specifically asked him not to and he split them anyways so we each got one. I didn't appreciate that at all. The calamari was terrible. First of all, it was only 30% calamari & 70% fried vegetables. And, it was very bland, even the marinara sauce which is supposed to be flavorful, but it was very bland. Their risotto was delicious though.  My date got the Osso Buco which was good, it came with some grains, peas and carrots. I got the halibut, it was just OK for me. It didn't even come with anything except for artichokes.  Finally, the chocolate souffle was really really good. That was probably the best thing there. And, we really enjoyed watching the fountains and the beautiful view. It was right at sunset also.  After my date paid, which was about 320 with the tip, I thought it was very rude that the waiter opened it & counted right in front of us. You are not supposed to do that. Step a few feet away and make sure the customer doesn't see that. It was OK but I probably would not want to come here again.",

It was actually my favorite noodle dish here, since the simple sauce helped me appreciate the perfectly cooked noodles even more.   The mushroom truffle risotto special was so savory and so balanced (truffle can sometimes be overpowering) and I have to say, it outdid my favorite mushroom risotto with scallops from Cafe Hiro (located in Orange County, CA). Scarpetta, you ruined me forever! Makes me almost regret coming here.   Food came out exceptionally quickly (even to the point of suspicion: Do they make it in batches? Do they anticipate order and make them beforehand? Who knows? Restaurant secrets). This was very much appreciated since we had to make a 9:30 show.  The wine expert was also very helpful with our wine selection. Just name some tastes you like and a price range and voila! Don't remember the name of the bottle we got but it was enjoyed all around.  Dishes to order: Mushroom risotto, spaghetti, diver scallops, market salad  Dishes to skip: Pici (not very memorable and at $38, big disappointment)",

We had let the waiter know ahead of time that we had to catch a show in roughly over an hour. The appetizer - the fried calamari came out super quick and was delicious with 3 different dipping sauces, which were all very flavorful too.   We were waiting for over 45 minutes and our entree still have not came out. We were pretty bummed out and was shocked how slow dinner service was. The waiter was apologetic because she saw the disappointment on all our faces and was proactive to bring up to comp our appetizer as we had to leave for our show since our main entree still did not make its way out. I acknowledge the waiter's efforts but wished the manager would have came by since it's a pretty expensive upscale restaurant.",

We gave them another try and were blown away by the service. What was even greater is listening to our server and other servers with other tables, they were just as friendly and amazing! Every single employee at Scarpetta has shown me that they do care about their guests and I am so grateful to Mario for reaching out. You will have a loyal customer from now on.  I need to add that the food is beyond amazing, the branzino has my heart...it was the best fish I have ever had.   As a local I have always loved Scarpetta and recommend it often to friends and family but after the terrible service I received from my server Michael I'll never go again nor will I recommend this restaurant.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and I believe a manager. They were very understanding about us being late for our reservation and she asked if we were willing to wait a few minutes she'd have an amazing table by the window. We agreed and sat at the bar, there we were greeted by a very friendly bartender who provided great service. It all started great until we were sat. We waited quite some time before a very cold and rude server gave us our menus. He never introduced himself, never greeted us or acknowledged us. I have received better service at iHop. After quite some time this rude server came to take our order, he still was extremely cold and rude. Not one smile not one ounce of personality.  The nice young man that delivered our appetizer and meal was the only positive in this experience.  Once our spaghetti arrived it took our server 5-10 minutes to come rudely dump Parmesan cheese on it. He never returned. Never came to see how things were going...nothing. The next time we saw him was when he came and handed us a dessert menu. Again, not one word or even eye contact. I informed him we wanted the check. He angrily took the dessert menus and stomped away.  I truly wish the tip we left could only go to the ones that actually wanted to be there and not this angry man. The only reason I know his name is because it's on my check. I truly think Michael needs to go work somewhere where he has zero interaction with people. How sad to see such terrible service at such a fine establishment.",

Their bread baskets had a variety of bread with Sourdough, Ciabatta, some kind of bread with salami (I think it was salami) and cheese, and one other kind that I didn't get to try.   - Colorado Lamb 3.5 STARS : I had the lamb...this one was a little disappointing. I've had way better lamb from another high end restaurant and paid half as much. I ordered it medium well and they gave it to me with a lot of pink left. It was also VERY FATTY... not a fan of fatty meats. There was also a piece of foil left on my meat from how they cooked it.   - Filet of Beef: 5 STARS- my friend ordered this bad boy. It was cooked to perfection!!! I wish I ordered that! I honestly can't say much about it since it wasn't my meal. I had a little taste though. My friend loved it and said it was some of the best steak he's ever had.   - Raviolini 4 STARS - the vegetarian of the group ordered this. She loved it so much that she finished it before I could ask for a bite! She said 4 Stars because it was such a small quantity and she's had better before. Feel free to disregard this part since I didn't try it.   DESSERT...  This was a joke it was so disrespectful that I wish they never brought it out. I didn't even eat it I just left it. They said \"oh yeah let me bring the bday boy a special treat.\" They might as well have slapped me in the face lol look at the pics and you'll see what I'm talking about.   DRINKS:  Way too strong and way too expensive. We ordered a gin and tonic along with a vodka cranberry. Both of them must have been at least 50% alcohol lol. I like to enjoy my drinks... we kinda had to just power through them lol. We also ordered some coffee which was whatever honestly. Their average bottle of wine cost anywhere from 120-200 a glass of their cheap Chianti cost 15. I expected expensive but not THAT expensive. Corking fee is $50 so bring your own bottle.   Atmosphere: Super cute and super romantic. We even had a view of the Bellagio fountains! The only drawback was how dark the lighting was. Waaaay to dark. We sat by the wall of wine which was really aesthetically pleasing but also annoying because we had employees grabbing bottles from the wall. In order to get a bottle they had to squeeze in between us and the wall. That happened about 5-6 times while we were there.",

Foie Gras Ravioli- I could buy better ravioli at Trader Joe's. The inside should have been pureed.  Jack Dorey- Bland and tasted like chicken.  Branzino- No flavor and wasn't crispy, temperature felt like it sat around.  Octopus- Tender one of the better dishes needed a little bit more acidity and to be a little more crispy.   Good service. Good view of the strip if you have the right table.   Good ingredients, poorly executed.   The best food I have had is off the strip. If you truly care about food, I suggest you take a cab ride off the strip, there are some fantastic gems out in Vegas. If you don't care about flossing for Instagram and you like excellent food off the strip is your best bet.",

We had the oysters which were topped with caviar to start with giant Calamari(where did they get octopus). The carpaccio was so delicate. Well done. We must of had 3 bottles of \"El Monde\" pinot which paired perfectly with dinner. The duck fois gras ravioli was drizzled with, what I think was a Marsala reduction, and was just right. My wife had the spice lobster ravioli (level 5) and dynamite. Definitely one of the best meals this year. A favorite to go back to soon.",

    "text": "Our server was Jenny and she was very friendly and explained the menu well. They have a vegetarian menu with two main dishes and a couple side dishes. Their specialty is spaghetti but you're able to add meatballs or vegetables for an extra cost I believe.  The portions are good and the food was good. We started off with a bread basket (vegetarian for us and salami for our friends). It came with a variety of bread choices that were all delicious. The bread also came with olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and butter. The spaghetti was good, but for $24 I'm not sure I would come back and pay that again.   The environment is nice for an anniversary or date night. It's dim lighting with quiet music playing in the background. There's also a nice view.  Overall, service was great and food was good but not too many options in my opinion and quite pricey for what you get.",

I decided to go on a date with my gf and made reservations for a late Friday night dinner. Place is not too upscale and not casual either. Perfect for a date or a nice dinner with friends/family. We were lucky enough to get a seat close to the window where you can see the Bellagio Fountains - definitely set the mood. Bread was delicious and it comes with a few dipping sauces. I ordered the duck & foie gras ravioli and my date ordered the spaghetti. The portion size was average for both dishes. 4/5 for the duck & foie gras ravioli - i enjoyed the marsala reduction and 3.5/5 for the spaghetti - average taste but not too bad. I do want to try some of the other dishes. Next time I'll give it another try along with some wine.",

Had the Agnolotti with the Short Rib, breadcrumbs, & brown butter, and my wife had the spaghettini their signature dish with the meatballs, fantastic. The bread basket was awesome, but there was one piece that stood out, the bread that was stuffed with Mozzarella and Salami, oh my gosh just amazing.  Unfortunately, the management and our server were so wrapped up with a couple of inebriated gentlemen who I guess deserved all the attention, they catered to there every need.  It's a real shame when this happens because it takes away from a great dinning experience and a memory in which you would've liked to have remembered for your anniversary. Just a note the restaurant wasn't that busy either, so not sure why the low grade service.  Big thanks to the hostesses, as they were so nice to greet us with \"Happy Anniversary\" when we arrived, however our server was nice and attentive, but got so wrapped up with the two gentlemen, must have forgotten it was our anniversary, and just brought our check, and went back to visiting. This accounts for the one less STAR, to bad, the managers that night and or server dropped the ball, I'm sure everyone noticed that was having dinner as well.",

We had the scallop appetizer, and instead of us sharing off one plate, they put one scallop on each of our plates so we could individually taste what a perfectly cooked and garnished scallop tastes like.   Next, my husband had the foie gras ravioli which he didn't shovel into his mouth because he wanted to enjoy and savor each bite. I had the gluten free spaghetti with tomato and basil sauce. You'd think something so simple wouldn't get your heart racing, but there was nothing simple about the flavor of this beautifully done dish.   Finally, we ended with the gluten free chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. This was not the dinky salted caramel sauce you get at a coffee shop - this is the sauce that ruins all sauces on desserts. If it wasn't so upscale, I probably would have licked the plate and asked for a gallon of this sauce. The gelato had a perfect rich, creamy texture, and it complimented the cake and the sauce instead of taking over the plate. The textures and taste of this cake alone is a reason to come here.   Everything about Scarpetta is excellent. Try to get a table near the windows to catch views of the Bellagio Fountains while you enjoy some of the best food in Vegas.",

    "text": "There are so many options to think about at The Cosmopolitan when it comes to dining.  If you are thinking about a romantic dinner overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this the restaurant to choose.  Additionally when you go before Christmas the hotels all tend to put their restaurants on a rotation since it is slow season.  Scarpetta had been closed for 10 days until the night we went.  When I had made my reservations i mentioned it was my gal's birthday and would like a seat near the window.  We got there for our reservation and a table with 3 people showed up after us.  They were given a window seat.  We were given a table 3 rows away from the window and next to the waiter station.  We had a limited view of the Bellagio Fountains. The place is pretty dressy casual and there were a couple who had old jeans on sitting by the window.  We were limited on time as we were trying to catch a show at the Bellagio.  The one thing to note is that our waiter was attentive to that point and never pushed us on dessert, but did apologize a couple times for the slowness of the kitchen during the meal.  We ordered our drinks as well as our meal in one fell swoop. As we were in a rush at the night was young, we ordered the yellowtail and tuna susci with caviar for appetizers and  had the duck and foie gras ravioli and diver scallops with foie gras for main courses.  Everything came out slow and we were rushed!  We had two drinks before appetizers finally came and I knew something was wrong and didnt want to ruin the evening.  They brought out the yellowtail but then a full tin of Russian caviar with toast points...etc.  Fortunately we love caviar.  Unfortunately this was not going to be a simple $150 meal!!!  I did not want to and maybe should have said something but we had had a few drinks and I did nit want to ruin the special evening planned any more.    The Duck and Foie gras ravioli was good but not as great as it sounds.  it was just too tempting to resist. I love duck and I love foie gras but I guess it didn't work well together for me.  The scallops were good too.  Now that California has lifted its ban on foie gras I can now more easily pass when I see it on menus.  The yellowtail appetizer was just okay as well.  Now the caviar was awesome but it is something I would rather have at a nice cocktail party and not on my own dime.  I am still wondering how that was put on my ticket because it was nowhere on any menus I saw.  My $19 dish turned into a $225 dish and my bill came to over $500 for two!  Ugh!!!  Yes it was a special night, but very costly!",

    "text": "The consensus among our group about Scarpetta was pretty meh. While some of the food was well done, we expected more given the price, and several of the dishes fell flat in terms of flavor. We were able to get a last-minute reservation late on a Saturday night, but from my experience, Vegas is built to handle so many people that reservations anywhere but the most exclusive restaurants aren't necessary.   The restaurant looks out the side of the Cosmopolitan, and you get a decent but not amazing view of the side of the Bellagio fountains (the giant Bellagio sign gets in the way somewhat). The vibe is trendy upscale, and the prices reflected that. We couldn't find any wines under $100/bottle (but if a $4400 bottle is what you want, Scarpetta can accommodate you (and yes, that's not a typo)). Consulting the sommelier revealed only 2 such options, one of which was only a red blend. The few wines I recognized were priced about 3x retail, which isn't outrageous, but it's not great either. The cocktails were strong and priced typically for Vegas at ~$16 apiece. Mine was tasty but not anything special. My wife's made her sick later that evening, despite being the only thing she drank that night (she is sensitive to cheap alcohol or alcohol with lots of sugar).  The service was average. We were promptly seated, but when it came time to order drinks our server was nowhere to be found, and he often left the table too quickly to notice that some people were trying to get his attention. This improved as the night went on, and by the end of the meal, I didn't really consider the service to be a problem.    The appetizers are not made to share, and you should prepare to drop some cash if you want to get anything for the table. $26 for 2 scallops is hefty with a group of 6. We settled on oysters, which were the only reasonable choice we could find. Luckily, a variety of freshly-baked breads (some with meat/broccoli and cheese) are served with a nice array of spreads/dips, and all of them were tasty. The bread will keep coming if you want it, and this could easily serve as your main appetizer.  The lobster pici pasta was creamy and decently flavorful, but the portion was small for the price, which seemed to be a theme for the evening. The only exception was the Tomahawk, which was enormous and impeccably prepared. I wish I had gotten it myself, as the few bites I had were hands-down better than the NY strip I had at a steakhouse the night before. One of my friends found the short rib agnolotti quite lacking, with not much flavor to speak of. My wife had the spaghetti with meatballs, which was rather plain, to be honest. The pasta had a nice texture, but I've had better sauce out of a jar and the meatballs were underseasoned and bland.   For dessert, we settled on the chocolate cake, which was OK but not mindblowing. It was moderately rich, but I've had richer cakes elsewhere. Additionally, the cake itself was quite small, which I found disappointing.   Overall, I wouldn't go back to Scarpetta. It was too overpriced for the small portion sizes and unpredictable quality of the food. It would do better at a slightly lower price point or with more impressive menu items. The menu descriptions all sound great, but the execution was lackluster too often for my liking.",

I personally had to power through each bite just to keep it down but it was so worth it. Short rib and risotto app was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked risotto and short rib that just melted. But the real star was the spaghetti. I have been dying to try this forever. Truly life changing. Amazing al dente noodles enveloped in a rich and creamy tomato sauce with fresh basil folded in. It was heaven. I could eat that every day. Due to our state of being at the time, dessert was not an option but next time I will be definitely be indulging. Can't wait to return!",

    "text": "This was the best meal I had this visit to Las Vegas! I was just in town a month prior and did some research about where to get good Italian food this time. Based on yelp, I was all set to get the spaghetti. But, based on my waiter's suggestion, I went with the short rib agnolotti and my mother got the tagliatelle with lamb bolognese. Our meals were good (hers more than mine) but I just didn't feel satisfied. So we ordered a third meal to share of the spaghetti. And WOW!!!!! It was the most basic, flavorful, al dente pasta I've ever had.  The basil came through every bite and the sauce was so smooth yet complex. Sometimes simple really is best.  I think about this spaghetti at least once a day and will definitely make a point to get it (maybe even twice) the next time I am in Vegas.",

The bill was super pricey, but it was worth every penny.  We would go back in a heartbeat!  Dimly lit and super chic, this place fits right into the Cosmopolitan!  We were seated right next to a window that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  We got to enjoy the show a few times during our dinner, absolutely beautiful.  The only eye sore is that down below are the \"hidden\" extra plants, dirt, etc that the surrounding resorts use.  A basket of five different types of bread is served with citrus olive oil, mascarpone butter, and eggplant/olive/tomato spread.  These were all absolutely amazing and they brought us another basket of bread for our meal.  This was a nice, unexpected treat!  For our primi piatti, we ordered the creamy polenta. It is usually served in a large bowl to share among the table, but they separated it for us.  The taste was so luxurious.  I could have made this my entire meal--I would highly recommend it!  For our entrees, my husband ordered their spaghetti.  This is one of their most well known dishes and it did not disappoint.  The best spaghetti I've ever tasted, hands down.  I ordered the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli and it was perfection.  The ravioli practically melted in your mouth.  I would definitely recommend both of these options!  For dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Souffle served with vanilla gelato & berries.  The best souffle I've ever had.  My husband, who isn't a sweets person, said it might be the best thing he has ever tasted.  This is a big deal coming from him.    It was an amazing evening and this dinner was a huge part of it.  The only reason I didn't give the restaurant a 5 star review, is because I found a piece of bone in my ravioli that hurt my tooth.  When you are paying for a fancy dinner like that, you don't expect these types of things to happen.  Regardless of that slip-up, it was amazing and I'm already craving it again!",

If I were to base my rating just on the ambiance and view of the restaurant, I'd give it a 5.   Unfortunately, the food wasn't impressive for the price. I had the pici and shared the creamy polenta. The pici had a really good chili pesto sauce. The pasta and lobster was perfectly cooked. But I expected the dish to wow me and it didn't. My favorite dish was the polenta. It was delicious.   Our server was friendly. I think it's worth a try, especially if you can get a view of the fountains. I think there are other restaurants in Vegas that are great and better priced. I'm not sure I'd come back.",

    "text": "*** Review is for Restaurant Week August 2014 Menu ***  Another restaurant that I've wanted to try now marked off the list.  The Restaurant Week menu is somewhat limited in selections, but what it has was very good.  I was seated next to the window overlooking the Bellagio and the fountains which added to the good atmosphere of the restaurant.  I was brought menus and an iced tea.  I had to ask for the Restaurant Week menu and it was brought.  I had already made my choice from the online menu but sometimes things change so I wanted to make sure.  I was brought a nice bread basket with sourdough and three other breads.  Accompanying it was a trio of bread toppers/dippers--mascarpone butter, caponata, and a citrus infused olive oil.  All three were good, but I could have eaten a plate of the caponata!  The mild citrus flavor in the olive oil made that my second choice.  For the starter, I ordered the creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  The polenta was brought in a white dish and the server then spooned the onion and wild mushroom mixture over the polenta.  The dish was excellent.  I almost took some bread to wipe up any leftover polenta.  For the main course, I got the fennel dusted black cod on a bed of concentrated tomatoes and roasted fennel.  The fish was cooker perfectly and was moist and soft but with a crisp crust.  The crust had a mild anise flavor from the fennel.  The tomatoes beneath, concentrated by baking until some of the water was rendered which gave the tomato a prominent flavor.  The roasted fennel was tasty.  For dessert, there was no choice but that didn't matter.  The bomboloni was a wonderful way to end a good meal.  The bomboloni consisted of two filled with Nutella ganache and one was filled with a vanilla cream.  Alongside was a small scoop of banana ice cream resting on crushed chocolate shortbread pieces.  Excellent!  Service was good for the most part.  Two small things--when your posted opening time is 6 PM, open at 6.  Seating people almost 10 minutes late is not the best form especially if someone has a show they need to get to.  Also, I had two Sweet 'n Low wrappers on the table that neither a runner nor the server cleared even though both were by several times.  That's something you wouldn't expect from a restaurant of this class.  I'm sure Chef Conant would point this out if he were dining there.  I wish I didn't have to ask for the Restaurant Week menu.  It was a sheet of paper.  Bring it with your large books of wine and dinner menus.",

There was sourdough, a type with meat in it, ciabatta, and some other small roll. It came with olive oil, tomato, and cheese mixed with butter as toppings, which were really delicious.  The creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms was also quite amazing, especially on the bread.  For some reason though, when our entrees came, everything just went downhill. The duck and foie gras ravioli just tasted weird and a bit too salty. The short rib agnolotti wasn't very tender or flavorful. The vegetable spaghetti was a bit better and the broccoli was pretty good. Overall though, a bit disappointed. Perhaps it was just an off night.",

The servers were numerous. We had a different person for almost every type of service; one guy who pours the water, another who seats you, another who takes your order, another who brings out the dish. It was very fun to get pampered.   We split the spaghetti and ordered mushrooms and brocollini as sides. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce is creamy with great flavors. Really a satisfying meal despite it's simplicity. The sides are as amazing as the main dish if not more! Again, we didn't order anything too exciting but the flavors are spot on.

Most of us got pasta and two people got steak. Everyone loved their food. I got the spaghetti and loved it. My friends got the Pici and loved that as well. I also liked the assortment of bread. The restaurant has a really nice vibe and offers pretty nice views. Four stars instead of five for the following reasons: 1) two of their drinks were not good at all and we had asked the waiter ahead of time if they were sweet, were reassured that they weren't 2) even though we sent one of the drinks back because it was just so gross we didn't get an apology, an offer to replace, or a comp. I expect better attention to detail when we're spending almost $700 on dinner. Other than that, everything was great. A nice addition to the great restaurants at Cosmopolitan.",

Quiet with smooth hits from the 80s playing in the backround.   The service was great and our server was very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  He recommended a great wine based on our specifications.  I tend to judge a restaurant by their breadbasket and Scarpetta gets an A+++. Skip the Italian bread they put on top of the basket and get to the cheese and pepperoni Stromboli.  I could have left happy after that.. it was amazing! The bread comes with olive oil, whipped marscapone and a tomato type sauce.   We started with the Scallops and beet salad.  Both were excellent.  The Scallops ( 2 good sized scallops) were cooked perfectly.  The beet salad was nothing super fancy but I knew that when I ordered it.  My parents both opted for meatier entrees- Dad the veal chop and mom the NY strip.  My moms meat was slightly undercooked but she opted not to send it back to be cooked more.. Both were excellent.  I had heard so much about the Spaghetti that I decided to try that.  It was the best spaghetti I had ever had so it is definitely worth trying if you want a pasta dish.  For dessert we go the chocolate molten cake and it was the best Id ever had! The salted caramel sauce was a nice touch.    I'd definitely go back to Scarpetta.  I liked it better than the other Italian options I've tried in Vegas (B&B, Carnevino).",

    "text": "Service: Top notch Food: Great Ambiance: Great  Sat myself at the bar area. Very small awkward area with the little tables next to the bar, would be pissed if someone sat me there. A very nice dude named Nikolai welcomed me with a smile and gave me a menu. Immediately decided between the Spiced Duck Breast and the Short Rib Agnolotti. Nikolai the bartender/server suggested the..  SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb $25  If the restaurant wasn't a fancy one, I would have licked my plate. My only complaint is there was not a large helping and I would have liked a little more food (when dont I want more food?).  Drank two San Remo's (fruity.. yum!) and a Billionaire (too citrus-y.. eh and I really like citrus-y things).  Service was good, my drink was always full and the bread was good. I'd recommend reservations highly, the dining room area seats about 100 people. Some of the tables even have a view of the Bellagio water fountains.. cooooool. Will definately have to be back for a full dinner one night (and not when I'm just trying to get something in my stomach before I drink alot of booze at the Blvd Pool).  After 3 drinks and my entree bill was $73 before tip.",

    "text": "Where to begin...  I went here 2 weeks ago and let's just say from the start it was sub-par.  First, the restaurant is practically hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan.  Trendy, loud hipsters abound, bad sign.  There is a tiny sign that you have to walk down a half corridor to see if this is indeed Scarpetta.  The hostest, why are they all idiots, sat us in a half circle booth behind a party of 8.  So much for the view of the Strip.  Then it got worse, every waiter, bus-boy, customer as they passed behind us used the back the booth as a rail.  Pat, pat, pat 6 inches behind my head.  Awesome!  The interior of the place is the cause of this bad layout.  Giant columns everywhere, wrapped in god-awful brown padding.  I got the waiter and told him we needed to move.  He scurried away to get the manager?!?  She came over and did move us, hence the extra 1/2 star.  She moved us to the window, so I got to see the Strip with a large drape in the way, that hadnt been dusted in forever.    On to the food, achoo!  Yes I sneezed my way through the dust cloud from pushing drape out of the way.  The salads were good, we split a garden salad and an heirloom tomato salad.  Then I ordered duck & foie gras ravioli & my dining companion ordered the halibut wrapped in pancetta.  Oh Scott Conant, yea of pretty hair and arrogance, you can't cook pastas right!  It was over cooked.  Here is a hint, if all the raviolis stick together its over cooked.  If they are gummy and mushy its over cooked.  The halibut was dry, really dry, I mean damn I need a lot of water to eat this dish dry.  For dessert we split the donuts stuffed with vanilla cream or nutella, they were pretty good.    The waiter was ok, he got his wine varietals mixed up and he had a Richie-Rich hair do, not kidding, that was humorous.  The bread guy is priceless, an old italian guy with good bread who should have been running the place.  He probably forgot more about pastas than Scotty-boy knows.  All in all a forgettable experience, unless you like overpriced, mediocre food.  The rest of these 4 star reviews I got to wonder about, I mean their fav thing was the bread so 4 stars?",

Our server, was hands down one of the best in the business. Full of passion and enthusiasm for his food, we were truly excited for our dishes. Being that we had a party of 5, he removed our menu's from our hands and told us that the chef would be preparing something fantastic for us. We ended up with small plates of 4 courses: starting with appetizers, pasta (duck fois gras ravioli, linguini with black truffle, their famed spagetti); a branzino and meat affair for the 3rd course (Sicilian spiced duck breast, and seared scallops...plus many more items (I believe it was 5 plates for each course) for party to share, which was fantastic!   Hands down, best Italian meal that I've had in years. I will be back very soon. Ciao!",

Have to say price is not expensive, but food was not the best.  Especially signature dishes as spaghetti and duck breast.  The spaghetti is like random home made tv dinner.  Noodle was too thick.  Duck breast is way over cooked.  Expect a bit more from Cosmopolitan fine dining.  For usd 250 per person, the package should be a bit better.",

Our wine expert steered us to a spectacular red that worked with every course.

In essence, our best meal in Vegas and perhaps for many months.",

This place is dim (low lighting) and I can't remember much about the decor.  Hey, it's Vegas, I was on vacation and probably (okay, obviously) was pretty tipsy.

Overall they pasta main courses were fine, but didn't blow us away. The black cod entree was a small portion but delicious.

    "text": "On the food alone, Scarpetta is probably a four star restaurant. But with the spectacular space it occupies (Cosmopolitan Hotel, overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it gets the five star nod from me.   The perfect ambience is hard to ignore. Unbelievably swanky, Scarpetta just oozes Vegas. Dimly lit, white linens, dark wood and interesting light fixtures mix to create a very upscale atmosphere.   Food wise, I enjoyed two appetizers: the pea soup and sea scallops. The soup excelled where other dishes didn't in that the pea flavor wasn't showed up by the cream. For the other appetizer that made up my one 'entree', I found my scallops to be cooked near-perfectly, but one of them suffered from too much char, rather than a nice caramelization. There was also a too-gratuitous use of garnishes, from radish, to micro greens, to apples and more. Less would've been more when the scallops are served with truffles white asparagus.   The dishes our friends had all received the same comment: heavy. While its summer and seeing the words 'summer truffles' on multiple dishes is never a bad thing, all those dishes all felt so heavy with butter and/or cream.   I would be remiss if I didn't cap this review with a mention of the bread. Served with dishes containing citrus-infused olive oil, cold eggplant spread and a mascarpone butter, the bread itself was out of this world good (though also heavy, as it's laced with a thin slice of salami and cheese).   I can't say that my Scarpetta experience didn't live up to the hype. However, like much of Vegas, there was a sliver of feeling that the food itself didn't quite live up to the glitz and glamor of the restaurant itself.",

    "text": "scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor of the cosmopolitan hotel.  you can either take the escalator or the elevators up.  if you do take the escalator to the 2nd floor, the escalator to the 3rd floor is around the corner not immediately next to it.    they have a bar area if you can't get a reservation.    they dim the lights.  the setting is nice and elegant.  the wine cellar is a whole wall of the restaurant.  we sat next to the wine cellar wall.  if you sit next to the window, you can get a view of the bellagio water fountain.   the complimentary bread basket was extraordinary.  it consisted of ciabiatta, foccacia, homemade stromboli w/salami + smoked mozarella,  the stromboli was warm and reminded me of pizza. =)  it came with condiments of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant tapenade, and a mascapone butter.    usually when the wine list is that extensive, we ask the waiter for recommendations.  he asks questions like would you like red or white...light, mildly bold, or bold.  we chose bold...which was the chianti...and sure enough it was very bold in flavor.  it comes in a glass flask.  this is to let the wine breathe before serving.  then they pour the flask into your glass.  they make sure that the wine arrives at the optimal temperature.    our first appetizer arrived...the braised short ribs comes on a bed of risotto with shavings of parmesan cheese on top.  since they knew we were sharing, they split the portion so that we had our own pretty half of braised short ribs.  if they hadn't done that we may have fought over it.  deep flavors, tender ribs, and perfectly cooked risotto tickled our palates.  we enjoyed it so much that we asked the waiter for another menu to try more appetizers.   we ordered the tuna scusi (which was recommended by the waiter) and the sea scallops.  the waiter came back to inform us that our entrees were already fired up...if we would want the rest of the appetizer to arrive before the entrees...or if it was okay that the entrees arrived and then to have the newly ordered appetizers..  we told him that whatever was done first was fine.  but that shows that they take enough care in serving their food to notify us.  the sea scallops were equally savory.  it was seared to perfection with several different types of mushrooms.  there was also a sunchoke sauce on the plate that tasted like a deep cream of mushroom sauce (but its different...but the closest flavor that i can think of..).  the tuna scusi was not as impressive, not because it was not a good appetizer.  it was like sushi...vegetables inside with thinly sliced tuna instead of seaweed wrapping the vegetables.  it wasn't bad but it just didn't have the wow factor of the previous two appetizers.   now on to the entrees...  first we had the duck and foie gras ravioli.  adorable little triangular pillows of ravioli drizzled with a brown sauce.  do not be deceived with the small ravioli, these packed a punch of flavor.  hubby said that this dish worth coming for.  course he also laughed saying that there was a scarpetta location in beverly hills.  pasta bliss!  we also had the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  i read about this spaghetti so i had to try it for myself.  why was this spaghetti better than most spaghetti??  well, my answer came when i took the first bite, the spaghetti tasted like chinese hand pulled noodles!!!   no one else has said that...but the spaghetti really did taste like chinese hand pulled noodles.  if you are familiar with it, you would know that the noodle is chewy and must be cooked al dente (example: like jia jiang mein).  it's chinese hand pulled noodle with an italian flavoring.  now you know. *wink*  there was no room for dessert.  the waiter commented that we did well since we devoured everything...two bread baskets w/condiments, three appetizers, and two entrees.  each dish had great presentation.  we stared at each plate for a couple seconds since it was \"too pretty to eat\"...before taking the first bite.   oh, this meal was worth it.  the bill arrived and was less than we expected also.  food -- 5 stars presentation -- 5 stars service -- 5 stars",

The staff was friendly and accommodating and the food was delicious.  I highly recommend the foie gras ravioli, and any of the house made pasta for that matter.  One recommendation would be to make reservations as early as possible as the restaurant appears to be very popular and is relatively small.",

My wife was really wanting to try Scott Conant's iconic and so simple spaghetti after seeing it on The Best Thing I Ever Ate once on Food Network.  We had done the Steakhouse thing already and were ready for some Italian anyway.  We are SOOOO glad we came to Scarpetta.  Every bit of the meal was fabulous from the stiff cocktails to the impeccable service and the just unbelievably tasty food.  Honey's spaghetti was all she could hope for and my Branzino was a masterpiece, perfectly seared, with the most delicious fish stock based sauce that was poured over it table side. My brother had a seared duck dish and my niece some pumpkin-based filled pasta dish.  Throw in that we had a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains blasting every 15 minutes and just, wow!  To a person, we all agreed Scarpetta exceeded our expectations!!!",

    "text": "Bread was good, Caponata very salty. Lardon wrapped shrimp tasty, although lentils overcooked (or maybe they wanted mash, either way not great). Polenta was super creamy, and the food runner said  he was topping with truffles, while menu said mushroom fricassee. Either way it was soupy. We had asked about a greens type salad and the server said that a Caesar was an option. Dressing was great, but there was too much. Croutons were at least a week old, stale and gross. The pasta which we were most excited about was not al dente, as promised. The ragu was good, but the dish was just a bowl of noodle mush. Brussels sprouts cooked well, but were missing the promised sage pesto and the walnuts. Also I don't believe they seasoned them. We left them uneaten. Gelato-lemongrass was fine but bland, almond was icy as f. Seems like these acclaimed chefs can't control quality like they do at their flagship locations. Vegas is like the red headed step child. Scott Contant can give brutal critiques on chopped, but he may need to take some of his own advice.",

Made a reservation for Valentine's dinner so I was super excited to try out this restaurant with my husband but the host lost our reservation and when we arrived they made us wait for over 45 minutes.  We were both starving at this point but waited patiently and when they finally sat us we got seated in the entrance area in the corner which wasn't very romantic at all.  The food also took forever which made us even more annoyed.    I decided to try this restaurant a few times after this incident and have had a better experience so I do think they have improved.    The ambiance in this restaurant is actually very nice and enjoyable.",

The lighting in the restaurant was a bit dark to see exactly what you are eating but the food was great. Not mind blowing, but great.  Bread service (complimentary) - was fantastic. I loved the variety. Scallops ($23) - were cooked perfectly but I've had better back home in SF. Creamy polenta ($18) - was really smooth and tasty. I think it needed a pinch of salt but this was our 2nd fave of the night. Spaghetti with tomato and basil ($24) - was not mind blowing but it's the best dish of the night and I can see why people are crazy about it. Pici ($36) - tasted fine but the spaghetti tasted better. Black cod ($33) - was good but not memorable. Chocolate souffle ($15) - typical souffle but it was properly made which I appreciated. It was big, enough for the two of us.  Service was fantastic, we shared everything and our server had most of the dishes come already split. We never felt abandoned. Someone would always be around to make sure our glasses are full. Portion size is on the larger size which is great to see nowadays. We didn't know this so we over ordered by about two dishes.  We have great modern italian restaurants back home (SPQR, Quince, Flour + Water) so my standards are a bit high. I do however still recommend this place if you were craving for modern italian.  The place looks dressy but we came in jeans and were fine. There were others in jeans as well. And of course there were some who were WAY over dressed.",

Tips:  - make sure you reserve a seat by the window or at least facing the window to see the Bellagio fountains  - order the farmer's market salad, short rib & bone marrow agnolotti ravioli  Ambiance ~5 stars  Restaurant located on the third floor of the cosmopolitan hotel and the seats and placed to face the window that has a view of the bellagio fountains.   Food ~5 stars Various types of bread served with olive oil, egg plant tomato spread, and ricotta cheese. I couldn't get my hands off the eggplant tomato spread.   Farmer's market salad: definitely one my favorite salads that has pine nuts, arugula, truffle...i didn't have to force myself to eat it because it was delicious  Diver's scallop: 2 scallops that were cooked to perfection, tender  Foie gras ravioli: rich and buttery in flavor but I prefer my foie gras to be complemented with tart ingredients, I could hardly notice that it was foie gras  Short rib & bone marrow agnolotti ravioli: the menu list horseradish as an ingredient and that is something that I do not like but I couldn't taste it one bit, I preferred this dish over the foie gras ravioli since there was more flavor  Picci: pasta was interesting with chili pesto sauce and large chunks of lobster  Chocolate souffle: i was not impressed with the texture of this souffle, it was not as fluffy as I would like   Service ~3 stars The restaurant was understaffed on a busy new years day. We were seated but did not receive the menu until 10 minutes later. The waiter was hardly present and we had to get service from other waiters.",

Presentable dining area for larger groups. Fast at wine refills.  - I loved the spaghetti! Although simple, the noodles tasted great! The flavoring was fresh and rich.  - Their polenta was unremarkable. Cornmeal boiled in porridge. I prefer simple mashed potatoes.  - Fresh tomato salad! Loved the ripe tomatoes. But awkward to eat as family-style.  - The chicken was soft and tender. Not too salty. I'm glad I got this over the Cod. Although the cod was flavored nicely, I didn't like picking some of the bones out of it.  - Dessert was amazing. Not too sweet, but the correct balance to end of the meal. - Overall, nice plating and nice night.",

    "text": "We came here for our Anniversary and was really looking forward to what looked like an amazing dinner. The best part about our experience was the bread basket and dessert. Everything inbetween was a disappointment unfortunately.   *The bread basket was amazing   *The tuna and avocado appetizer was so bland. The waiter told us guests had complained of too much citrus added to the dish so they took it away. WTF  So now Im paying almost $20 for a piece of tuna with sinew running through all of our pieces and plain avocado. It was a slight joke. Im sure it was better with the citrus dressing they got rid of.   *The spaghetti was good I ate all of it but I added the meatballs which were also a joke. They were so tiny and tasted like baby food.   *The short Rib ravioli dish was good  *The mascarpone cheesecake was heaven.   *The service was great, almost a little too attentive like they were trying to rush us through the meal for table turn over.   *All in all it was ok. The view of the Bellagio fountains was a bonus. I felt like I was paying more for the view than the food. I love Scott Conant, I love Chopped, there are so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas and I was reaaally looking forward to going there but I was a bit let down. If we were to return to Scarpetta it would be for a cocktail and dessert.",

    "text": "Service was just what you would hope for in a restaurant of this caliber. Attentive to every need, but never in your space.   We started with the octopus and squid salad. A fantastic choice. It was served some clover, chick peas, and a slice of octopus that was so tender, I couldn't believe it! The squid was rolled up plated with some greens as well. It was delish!  The pasta we chose was the house speciality - tomato and basil. It was so fresh and so basil-y! There was just something about it - almost creamy, but not creamy. The texture was all to do with the tossing of the pasta and sauce with a little EVOO as a second step. Yeah, I asked.   For dinner I chose the veal chop, and I'm so glad that I did. It was cooked perfectly and was just the right size portion. My husband had the fennel crusted cod. It is prepared with the skin on, and was very nice (so he says, because I didn't get a taste!).   Then dessert was a spectacle to behold. The anniversary trio was complete with chocolate-filled doughnuts, strawberry milkshakes, chocolate toffee brittle, and ice cream, too. It was unbelievable.   We will definitely make this a regular stop in the LV book!",

Ordered Mediterranean octopus, duck and foie gras ravioli, black tagliolini, spaghetti, fennel dusted black cod, broccoli rabe, and strawberry souffle. The stand outs were the octopus and ravioli. Everything else fell flat. Our spaghetti came out crunchy; well under done. Sent it back to get it cooked a little longer and it still came out not cooked through. I question if the pasta is made in house. The souffle was undercooked as well. They sent a plate of bite sized desserts to make up for it but I was over it by that point. Took forever and a day to close the bill. A little weird when the restaurant was empty but, whatever. A plus was the view of the bellagio fountain and plate presentation.",

Most restaurants on the strip with with a celebrity chef name are just that - an overpriced restaurant with subpar food living off their name. To start I had the polenta which is to die for! They bring wild mushrooms in a sauce table side and pour it over your dish. As a second course we shared the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, also highly recommend this dish. Main dish consisted of the prime beef once again delicious.   For once a high profile chef and restaurant lives up to the hype. Hail to the pasta king!",

Fortunately there was a fantastic bread basket with 3 types that kept us going.  Drinks we got the Gallardo and San Remo. Gallardo was a nice appletini-ish drink and the San Remo was delicious.  We shared 3 dishes: the tuna+avocado and yellowtail to start. The tuna dish was more or less as expected with great quality fish and a nice garnish, also plentiful. The yellowtail came with 4 or 5 paper thin slices, also as expected served with a very subtle ginger/salt sauce. I was a little dissapointed with this given the quantity and quality.  We shared the branzino as an entree, which was incredible and served in a killer shellfish broth with small pieces of lobster, mussels, and potato.   Service was definitely a little slow for our table (others were being served quicker) but we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal.   Overall, 4/5 stars based on what we ordered for the price and the service, could easily be 5/5 based on other items so I'll return to try it out in the future.",

    "text": "We were starving when our flight landed in Vegas. Luckily, they were flexible on our arrival time with the reservation, but I guess it wasn't totally full anyway even though it was a Friday night.   The warm  bread basket was a nice way to start:  - Broccoli strombili: broccoli raab and cheese in bread  - Salami stromboli: better flavor with the fatty meat - Ciabatta: doughy  - Focaccia: good olive oil flavor  These came with mascarpone butter (very subtle), lemon olive oil (nice), and an eggplant caponata, which I liked.  Pastas:  - Short rib agnolotti: better with some extra cheese. The first few bites were good, but it got pretty monotonous, and I wish they had a smaller portion of this. It was pretty rich - Tagliatelle: with lots of vegetables. guanciale, and a truffle zabaglione. I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but the textures and the flavors turned out to be really good  Sides:  - Mushrooms: a pretty good portion, slightly oily, but good flavor  - Cauliflower: I liked the gremolata on top, and it actually went well with the agnolitti since the pasta was so rich  We tried ordering some cocktails, but most were pretty unremarkable, and they definitely weren't the craft cocktails I was hoping for.  Food came out shockingly quickly, and I actually wish they had slowed it down a bit rather than bringing it all at once, since things got cold.   The view of the Bellagio fountains at night was beautiful (we got a seat by the window)..  While the food was not bad, it wasn't as great as I expected, and I doubt the Vegas version does the original Scarpetta justice.",

    "text": "Pro tip: When making a reservation, request a table by the Bellagio fountains and you won't be disappointed.   Pro tip 2: Not your traditional Italian restaurant (see menu).  Might be better off with Carbone if that's what you had in mind.   After our most recent Vegas trip, I've come to realize that a lot of what you pay for the many $$$ restaurants along the strip is the ambiance and the convenience of being on the strip.  The food itself is okay but not mind blowing, or at least not enough to justify the cost.  For that, I feel like you would have to go to one of the many famous $$$$ restaurants.  But who cares! It's Vegas. Scarpetta is really nice because of the view, but the food wasn't necessarily mind blowing.  The break-down:  Fritto misto: My girlfriend and I weren't really a fan of this. Seemed like a bunch of fried shoestrings served on a plate for $18 and not impressive.  Duck breast: This dish was tasty, but nothing too special that struck out.  Pici: Yes! My favorite dish of the night.  Very flavorful pasta with an olive oil base and chunks of lobster on top. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a pasta that feels light and bouncy.  Apart from the food itself, we also really enjoyed the bread selection.    Overall, despite some shortcomings from some of the food I enjoyed this meal overall.  While I personally don't see myself coming back here, would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a medium-high quality dinner who doesn't mind spending a little extra cash for the view and ambiance.",

But that was our only complaint. The food although not inexpensive was excellent. The fusion of flavors left you wanting more. We shared the burrata with beets, then the Short Rib with bone marrow Agnolotti. Both excellent and topped the night with a very creamy and light souffle. They really know how to make espresso just like you get in Italy. Great service and delicious food made for a wonderful night.",

    "text": "This was our fancy splurge celebration dinner while we were in Vegas. I tried to make reservations for 10 online through their website, but I was told that there were no reservations available within 2.5 hours of our reservation time (830pm on a Sunday) for 8 weeks. I called instead, and they were able to accommodate us.   When we got there, we had to wait for a little while for them to get our table together, but the cocktail menu was beautiful. I indulged in the Gallardo, Hendrick's apple, lime, and basil. It was fresh and clean, really light and flavorful. It also came with a basil leaf floating in it, and was gorgeous.   When they seated us, they'd given us a private dining room for our large group, and we had an amazing server who was knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to make suggestions.   The meal started with fresh baked rosemary bread served with a trip of condiments. There was soft, whipped marscapone butter, a rich eggplant tapenade, and simple quality olive oil. I order the spring pea soup with dungeness crab, almonds, and pea tendrils as a starter. It was so delicate, fresh, and really lovely. It tasted like spring. The crunch and nutty flavor from the almonds and the sweet meaty taste of the shredded crab was such a nice balance of the pea flavor. It was spring green, and melted in my mouth. I'm not even a huge fan of peas, but this is such a good example of how fresh, high-quality ingredients can elevate something simple to culinary art.   For dinner, I had the Pici with lobster that the server suggested. This is the best pasta I've ever eaten. And I've eaten a lot of pasta. It's house made and fresh, and this is how al dente is supposed to be. It's firm and chewy, but still delicate and flavorful. It was made with tarragon, so it was green and herby. The pesto was made of almonds and chili, so it had a little spice to it. I could've handled more spice, though. There was almost no heat, but it's OK because the other flavors were so perfect. This is also the best cooked lobster I've ever had. I'm used to lobster in butter, or pieces so small thrown into dishes to give them an upscale feel, but these were beautiful, pink large pieces of lobster. They still benefited from the fat in the olive oil pesto, and it brought out lobster flavors I hadn't tasted before. They were tender and meaty, and balanced well with the pasta and pesto. It was simply one of the best pasta meals I've ever had in my life.  One of the house specialties is spaghetti with tomato and basil. Sounds easy, right? Once again, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had in my life. The ingredients and technique are so high-quality that they elevate even the simplest meals into a once-in-a-lifetime experience.   The filet was tender and flavorful, although my companion felt is was little more medium-well than the medium he ordered. The potato puree it rested on absorbed the steak juices and every bite tasted luxurious.   The honey glazed carrots with toasted pistachios were roasted to perfection. They were soft, but not limp or mushy, and the pistachios added a pleasant nutty crunch. They were sweet, but not cloying, and well balanced. Again, I'm not a huge carrot fan, but these made me a believer.   My one 21st-century complaint is the lights are so low, I wasn't able to get great pictures, but really, that's probably a plus. It was intimate and romantic.   Indulge at Scarpetta and you won't regret it. Take your time and savor the flavors at this masterful restaurant. There's a lot of work and knowledge going into these meals, and if you're privileged enough to eat here, relish every bite.",

They were beyond anything else I've tried. Everything just melted in my mouth. For dinner I ordered the mushroom raviolis I think it was called foie gras ravioli. Again this plate was just outstanding nothing like anything I've ever had before. The grated cheese literally foamed on the plate. I can't stop talking about this meal and recommending this restaurant to others.   Another plus was the window seating which had beautiful views of the Vegas strip.

It's right across the magnificent window to watch the fountain show at the Bellagio.  $35 corkage fee. Not bad considering our party brought in a beautiful bottle of cab from Napa. Their adorable great grand master somm Noeh is the sweetest, nicest guy ever. He let us see his most prized bottle. He recommended a beautiful Amarone. Best value for a bottle of wine that's less than $200. Tell him the flavor profiles that you like and he will never steer you wrong.  Titus and the gang (all the crew who helped us) are amazing. Don't like your drink? Tell them what you want. I can't stress that enough. If you know what you want, they'll give it to you. No clue as to what you want? Well don't blame them if you got something that's not good enough for you.  Take your time and enjoy the experience that is Scarpetta. The staff is very courteous and genuine. Food? It's an italian place, so don't complain if the Hamachi isn't like Nobu's. Their agnolotti is divine. It's rich - and a little bit goes a long way.  Think of quality vs quantity. Four appetizers, an entree each and 2 desserts should be an amazing dinner for a party of 5. The food is rich. You will get gustatory fatigue if you try and finish a bowl of pasta with bone marrow and octopus all by yourself. The trio of lamb is tender and well seasoned. Have little bites from everyone's plate. That's when you know that you came here with the right group of family/friends and you're ready to have a great dining experience.  In a rush? Skip this. This is not a fast food joint. Want a big slab of foie? You obviously won't find it in a ravioli.",

My friend and I split the farmer's market salad and the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The agnolotti was a little oily and had a wasabi aftertaste (we were later told it was horseradish) that was a little weird. The texture of it was good but didn't make up for the flavor. I liked the farmer's market salad - it was crisp and crunchy and the hazelnuts were a really nice touch. Also, I asked for warm water and was given a whole teapot of it, which was great.   One of the girls didn't like her meal and when we told the server, he took it off our bill, no questions asked. That was really nice of him and even though one of our side dishes never got sent to the table, the amount of food we ordered turned out to be just right.

I liked the sea trout okay, not fantastic.  Husband liked his steak, but not the best for what it cost.  Friends couldn't finish the Caesar salad or Pici, & the portions are small.  They didn't like it & there was hardly any lobster in the Pici.  Expensive and food was not memorable.  The bread basket was good though.  Wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend to a friend.",

It was a wonderful experience and our waiter was top notch!! I would definitely go back and recommend anyone else to also.",

    "text": "While looking for a place to have dinner, I only needed to read 5 words to convince me to try this place out.  Those five magical words were \"duck and fois gras ravioli.\"  Umm...yes please!  So with little hesitation we called in for a reservation and I excitedly awaited dinner time.  Once we arrived at Scarpetta, we noticed that the decor was nice but not stuffy.  The people in the dining area seemed to be enjoying themselves and the view overlooking the Bellagio fountain just added to the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  The ambiance and decor definitely work well to add to the dining experience at this restaurant.  The service was also another thing that was nice and attentive but not overly intrusive.  They were very quick to take our drink orders and were quick to come back once they noticed we were ready to order.  They also did a great job of explaining all the complimentary breads and butters as well as fielding any other question we had.    Now for the important part, the food.  Here's a quick break down of what we had:  Complimentary Bread:  Ordinarily I wouldn't even mention this.  I mean, there are some restaurants that give you some phenomenally good bread but here is the thing that puts Scarpetta above and beyond those other places.  The stromboli!  Holy moly this thing is good.  Bread baked around cheese and pepperoni (I think it was pepperoni) was just so good.  I honestly could have had this for dinner and I would've have been completely happy.  Appetizers:  Tuna Susci -   Assorted marinated veggies and preserved truffles wrapped in tuna.  I suppose this was the chef's interpretation of a sushi roll but I have to say that it just fell flat.  I mean with truffle and tuna in the mix I am still scratching my head as to how this couldn't be good, but it just wasn't.  It was bland and under-seasoned.  My recommendation, don't get it.  Beet Salad - Pretty much what you expect of a beet salad.  A great assortment of different beets with pumpkin seeds and stracciatella cheese with a balsamic dressing, it was refreshing and delicious.  Braised Short Ribs of Beef - This was by far my favorite appetizer.  The short rib was succulent and delicious.  Bedded on root veggies and risotto, this in a larger portion would make an amazing entree, let alone an outstanding appetizer.  Entree:  Indulge me for just a second while I draw a perverted metaphor.  If dinner were a porno, the bread was the nasty making out, the appetizers the foreplay, then the duck and fois gras ravioli would be the money shot.  Goodness sakes alive this is one delicious pasta.  A nice big plate of perfectly cooked ravioli with a drizzle of marsala reduction; these decadent little bites were heaven in tiny little pockets of pasta.  If you like duck and fois gras, this is a must!  Overall, I had a great meal here.  I thought the prices were reasonable for Vegas fine dining, the ambiance great, the service spot on, and the food was just phenomenal.  Honestly, if I hadn't gotten the tuna susci appetizer, this would have been just about the perfect meal, but even the susci couldn't dissuade me from giving Scarpetta a well deserved 5 stars.  Bravo!",

    "text": "My wife, friends and I decided to try Scarpetta for the first time. We were expecting a 5 star experience.  Bottom line: We were DISAPPOINTED.  We arrived early and I approached the Hostess area to let them know the 5 of us would have a drink at the bar prior to dinning. I did request a specific type of booth that would accommodate the us facing the Bellagio. She barely spoke to me and had an attitude as if we were lucky to dine in her establishment. She did accommodate us but her attitude had us very DISAPPOINTED.   The wine list is extensive and has some great varieties. We ordered a bottle for the 5 of us. I noticed other patrons had some special chips at the other end of the bar. None for us? Not from the bartender. After waiting 10-15 minutes I had to walk over to the other side of the bar and get them myself. I then (Jokingly) told the bartender how good the chips were and he said, \"Yes-aren't they!\" Very DISAPPOINTED.  The dinning room is beautiful and we had a wonderful server, Titus. He was knowledgeable and professional. He was a bright spot during the evening. Our group had the endive & apple salad and braised short ribs for starters. They were very good and we highly recommend both.  For our mains we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (somewhat DISAPPOINTED) halibut (wonderful) and the rib eye (very DISAPPOINTED). Our friend ordered the rib eye medium and it came out very rare. He returned it for more fire and it came our perfectly. The problem was that we ate our mains without him and he then consumed his as we watched him. Very DISAPPOINTED.  I ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. It tasted very ordinary and seemed as though it may have been frozen.  I know you can't compare any souffle to Eiffel Tower Restaurant but I'm surprised they served a tasteless dessert here. Very DISAPPOINTED.  There are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas. There were some bright spots but we will not return. We were DISAPPOINTED.",

Which is strange because I never order Spaghetti when dining out, this ones special though. Black Tagliolini was delicious and some pasta filled with short ribs, I forget the name of it but it's different and probably isn't like anything you've had before. Order and share the Dry Aged Sirloin to accompany your pasta. It's a perfect fit, especially with the Spaghetti.  Dessert? Skip it. Had em all and not one I would order again, and by this point you'll have spent enough money.  Thought about giving Scarpetta 3 stars, not because of food but because of price, e.g. \"the handmade in house pasta\" spaghetti is $24. But I had to take into consideration of the convenience of being located on the strip and that location with it's great fountain views cost money.",

    "text": "Like other reviewers, I'm not a big fan of Scott Conant, a judge on the TV food show Chopped. Not sure if that's his real life persona or his made for TV Simon Cowell-like persona that makes for good ratings. I broke down and went to Scarpetta, totally prepared to hate the place. As much as I wanted to hate it, I loved it. It's always interesting to read the reviews and see the swings, with one reviewer hating it and the next loving it. It's usually the total experience that somehow helps make the food more or less memorable. It was totally memorable for me, from being with my wife to the Bellagio fountains to attentive service to the food being timely served, perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The bread basket was all artisan selections, a meal in itself. The creamy polenta and truffled mushrooms were heavenly. The spaghetti was as good as spaghetti gets....there's only so much you can do with it and I thought the sauce was outstanding. The black cod melted in your mouth and was a work of art. The coconut panna cotta was the most interesting, striking and palate pleasing dessert I've ever had.",

Our table had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains -- request that if you can. The ambiance as a whole was quite wonderful -- contemporary and elegant, but still warm and inviting.  Our server was very knowledgeable and gave excellent suggestions when we asked for them. Food was outstanding; we ordered different dishes and shared. The polenta, ravioli, scallops and duck received high marks by all. We would not at all hesitate to recommend or return here.",

It's the heaviest, tiniest, piece of chocolate cake I have ever had. It's good, but WAY heavy.  The better: The short rib with farro risotto. Oh so yum! How can you screw up short ribs?  The OUT OF THIS WORLD: The panna cotta with guava soup and coconut ice cream. Very few desserts I eat are memorable. This one is VERY memorable. For a panna cotta, this dessert was extremely light and had just a hint of sweetness (I thought the guava was going to make it super sweet, but it didn't). I would come back and eat here just for this dessert. No joke!  Our service was great. Request a table near one of the windows so you can see the fountain show at Bellagio.",

We were seated in a location that the staff had to continually pass things over one person to another as they wasn't enough room to walk around the table to serve each person.  The apps came out in a scattered pattern and the hot ones were anything but hot!  We even had to send one back as it was downright cold.  The entrees were marginally better. They arrived with in minutes of each other! And of course they had to get one wrong!! Which took almost 15 minutes to get right and out to our table! The $50+ steak, that was recommended and ordered medium rare came out medium well.  The veal chop that I ordered medium rare came out medium and obviously had been sitting on the pass line as it was room temperature at best.  When we explained the continuos problems to the Manager/sommelier he response was these things happen. Well these people will not happen to be going back to Scarpetta.  In a town with hundreds of choices that go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable, this one should be Chopped off your list!",

    "text": "phenomenal - best meal of my entire life.  I consider myself an \"entry level\" foodie - i love food, but have not had the opportunities to try an extensive amount of high end dining. That being said, I've eaten at some top notch restaurants in  the US and Europe and this is the best overall meal I've ever had.  Should also add we were fortunate to get the corner table overlooking the belagio, which was really nice. Ask for it if possible.    We ordered:  Appetizers: Scallops, beef tartar Pasta: Spaghetti, Duck Foi Gras Ravioli Entree: Duck, Veal chop Dessert: Bombelloni  The all stars of the evening was the beef, raviolio, and bombolloni. I rate each of these a 10/10. beef may be the most flavorful and delicate dish I've ever eaten (easily trumps what i ate in France). The ravioli was absolutely amazing with the perfectly cooked pasta and a smooth liver flavor on the inside.  We actually ordered the mousse for dessert, but our very attentive and friendly waiter suggested we go with the bombelloni instead. We trusted him, and glad we did. Hard to imagine eating donuts from DD ever again.  The other dishes were all perfectly cooked, but flavor wise they all earned an 8/10.   Staff was excellent, atmosphere romantic, and food top notch. Highly recommended - thank you Scott Conant!",

    "text": "I'd have to agree with the other reviews on how amazing this place was. service was top notch. food was fantastic. drinks were delish! definitely exceeded my expectations of food, service, and beautiful view of the strip and bellagio fountains.   Drinks: the bartender knows how to make his drinks. my sister got the berry smash which was made with fresh fruit. very yummy! not too sweet and just the right amount of fruity. I got an old fashion. I've been searching las vegas for the best old fashion and this place wasn't too bad. only thing lacking was a cherry  Food:  1) braised short ribs with root veggie and risotto- the risotto was a perfect pairing for this dish. it was super delish! if the meat was tender enough to cut with a fork i would say perfect. don't get me wrong it was still tender, but i think this dish would be PERFECT if it were just a tad more tender 2) sushi slices- pass on the raw fish. save room for the other stuff (good and fresh but there is so much other stuff to try)  3) roasted scallop- I'd have to say this was my fave of the night. i have a thing about scallops. they always seem to disappoint. but SW at the Wynn and Scarpetta have won me over with these amazing scallops. YUMMMMMM  4) polenta with truffle mushroom- i love mushrooms and this went perfect with the polenta. it came in two separate pots that you would mix together. super fab. it seems like an odd side dish for the food but GET IT ANYWAY!  Pastas: 5) spaghetti with tomato and basil- i wasn't impressed by this basic spaghetti that a lot of yelpers raved about. but the noodles were really good. home made noodles a little bit chewy and more dense than the standard spaghetti noodle you make at home 6) duck and foie gras ravioli- i'm not a big fan of foie gras but everyone at the table loved this dish. they said it was the best pasta dish we got. 7) stracci- lobster, crab, shrimp, and basil- this was my fav pasta dish. it was bursting with flavor. the shellfish was perfectly delicious. MUST TRY  8) lamb- my goodness this was the best lamb i ever had. if i didn't know any better i wouldn't even have known i was eating lamb. there was almost zero gamey taste that is commonly associated with lamb. YUMMMMMM  dessert: we had about 4 desserts. but the best i think was the gingerbread pear crisp. get a little side of gelato/ice cream. it was so good. i was stuffed to the brim at this point but i had to have more!  we also had some fish but i would go with the other amazing food rather than the fish dish. would love to come back here. its quite expensive but also quite yummy. my tummy was more than satisfied when i left :)",

    "text": "First, I met Mike Tyson when I dined here! And we danced in the middle of the restaurant. So an extra star for that!  Scarpetta is a beautiful restaurant. Beautiful Earth tones and a intoxicating view of the Bellagio fountains.  Scarpetta is one of those fancy restaurants with menu items that no one really knows how to pronounce; needless to say, I just ordered and hoped for the best. And the results we're favorable!  I could mention what I ate/ordered, but this place doesn't offer a fixed menu. It's seasonal and changes because your quality freshness. Everything that was order was amazing. There's a bread basket... I could have kept eating that and been a happy camper. There were several variations, my favorite was the stramboli (not the American version - I asked the server what it was because it was slap yo' mama good!), it's a combination of fresh bread and meat. It was a joygasm to the mouth! The bread basket is served with a fancy whipped butter, a roasted eggplant dip, and olive oil.   I order the yellow tail app (which they always have) and it did not disappoint. Fresh and tasty! I ordered a pasta dish (no idea what, who, where, why, yaddda, yadda, insert fancy words and culture here) and it was flavorful and light. The portion size was perfect. Not too much or too little. Seriously, I don't think you take doggy bags from places like that.  We ordered several desserts and they were all great and small enough to not get stuff and big enough to share.   They have an extensive wine list and it covers an entire length of a wall. It's a pretty sight.  The service was impeccable. Spot on. Courteous. Attentive.  Overall, Scarpetta was de to the lish. If I could afford it, I would definitely go back in a minute! I yearn for you Stramboli. Definitely not your traditional Italian, but a great modern twist.",

We had so many dishes I can't even remember it all (or all the fancy names) but it was amazing! I had the pasta with clams & my husband had their spaghetti. Both excellent! I am SUPER picky about my pasta being over cooked but this place was on POINT! I had the raw tuna appetizer which was just heavenly! We also had the polenta with mushrooms which was delicious!!! I don't even like mushrooms but this was soooo good!  Desserts were the highlight of this dinner! My good friend is a BIG DESSERTS girl so when our table was covered in desserts she about died. We had 5 different desserts the 4 of us shared and every single one was thoroughly enjoyed! Yum! My husband and my friend said the cheesecake and the souffle were by far the best they ever had! Personally I LOVED the homemade soda/fruit dessert that came out! It was so different and SO YUMMY!",

Scott Conant's famous restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains if you get a window seat, and has a wonderfully romantic but classic vibe. Not too loud, not too trendy, just elegant. I started with my favorite, a burrata and heirloom tomato salad with roasted eggplant which was quite a large portion and was very fresh. It needed to be considering what I was following it up with...Duck & Foie Gras ravioli. I know. Whenever out of CA right? Homemade pasta stuffed with melt in your mouth pockets of foie gras drizzled with a barolo reduction. I'd never had anything like it and probably never will and it was truly amazing and truly rich. I started with a cocktail that I don't remember the name of, but it was a usual concoction of my favorites, gin, basil, apple juice, and something else delicious and fresh. I wish I could remember more what Tristan had...he started with a fresh soup of some kind, pureed italian pea poured over veggies and hazelnuts I believe that he went nuts for. He also had a pasta (all homemade needless to say) with a lamb ragu. I'd absolutely go if you have the opportunity.",

WE COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING TO JUDGE HARSHLY.  First, try to request a table by the window/with a view. The restaurant has an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain at night.   We did the tasting menu and it was TOTALLY WORTH IT. One of the best meals I've ever had and SO FILLING. Second tip: DO NOT fill up on the delicious bread at the beginning of the meal if you are doing the tasting menu. We were so stuffed but we actually finished our whole meal. The waiter commented that we were the first to actually finish the tasting menu in a month because everyone fills up on bread and ends up not being able to finish their dishes.   Amazing food. IMO highlights were the creamy polenta and black cod.",

    "text": "As soon as I had my flight and hotel booked for Vegas I also made my dinner reservation at Scarpetta. Even though we had made our reservation made for 8 on a Saturday night we still waited about 15 minutes or so for our table. Upon getting seated in the dining room I was incredibly impressed. The room was dimly lit, beautifully decorated and facing the fountains of the Bellagio.   Our waiter quickly approached with our wine and cocktail lists and allowed us to look over them for a while. When he approached again we were still indecisive. We told him what we were thinking about ordering and he made a great suggestion. Now that drinks were ordered, it was time to dig into the bread basket. We loved the stromboli as well as the sourdough and focaccia bread. The eggplant caponata was also delicious. If I wasn't to embarrassed to order another bread basket I would have done so.  After we had ordered we were anxious to receive our food. We started with the shortribs over farro pasta. The shortribs fell apart and were incredibly rich. The farro was the perfect companion to this well made dish. Our polenta was next. It was creamy and topped with mushrooms. Wow. We finished with the home made tagilatelle with vegetables and fava beans as well as guanciale. Being the pasta snob Scott Conant is on \"Chopped\" I knew this had to be good. I was right. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was light and flavorful. Seeing as we weren't completely full we ordered dessert.  And what a dessert it was. The bombolini were basically dougnut holes filled with nutella and a vanilla custard. They were accompanied by a nutella powder and bruleed bananas. It was the perfect combination of textures: The soft doughnuts, the creamy nutella and vanilla custard, the crunchy bruleed bananas and the light nutella powder were out of control good.  Scarpetta is a must for Italian food lovers in Vegas. It's the perfect place for a date night.",

And I'm definitely not exaggerating. But then again, I've never been to Italy.  Seriously though, if you come here, at least get this dish. You will not regret it. I promise.

    "text": "A-OK is what Scarpetta was. I was very excited to finally taste the famous pasta from the man himself-Scott Conant. I have been watching Chopped for weeks and was curious what exactly does he think amazing pasta is. Well Scott maybe Pasta is the only thing you should stick to.  We have ordered the Hamachi, Tuna, Polenta, Foie Gras Ravioli, Black Cod and the Tasting Menu.  Let's start from the beginning. First of all I would like to say that the service was beyond reparable. We sat at the restaurant for almost 3 hours. It took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and every time we looked for him he wasn't there. After hinting and hinting that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left.  Here is the breakdown:  Hamachi: nothing special-Nobu beats this dish any day of the week.  Tuna Susci: If you think wrapping tuna over a bunch of carrots is creative-think again.  Polenta: I really enjoyed this dish. It came in a small pot with a mushroom sauce on the side. This was one of my favorite appetizers.  Black Cod: it was A-OK. I wish it had more flavor and was more moist. I guess beggars can't be choosers.   Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli: The dough was chewy and hard. The sauce on top ruined the whole dish in my opinion. The inside was tender and rich. I think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come together better.  Tasting Menu:  Fritto Misto: A-OK. I like anchovies but I don't think this dish brought anything special to the table.  Spaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night! It was tender, flavorful and tasty. I would have this again any day!  Dessert: the chocolate cake was dry and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth!  We tried a few other things which I don't even care to discuss on the Tasting Menu  The bread basket was also pretty amazing! It came with 3 sauces which we ordered a second round of!  Overall I am not impressed by this Italian Restaurant. This has nothing to do with price or the atmosphere. I think as a food critic what you look at is the freshness of the food and the service. I have seen a lot of bad service but ignoring your patrons will not bring you very far.  So Scott Conant I am giving you a C+. You have been chopped!",

If I was chief Ramsy I would say that the mushrooms on the Palenta were too hard.   Basically you are paying for location on the strip.    Service was ok (a little on the slow side).

    "text": "While perusing menus for a special dinner in Vegas, I quickly narrowed it to Scarpetta because of their robust vegetarian offerings (both on the regular menu and then an additional veggie menu) and price point. It is less than some of the fanciest restaurants on The Strip and I can now confirm that the food is equally as good.  Ambiance- We chose Scarpetta without even realizing until later that it was located in our hotel (The Cosmopolitan). For as loud as the hotel can be right outside the restaurant, the inside was quiet, calm and classy. The hostess mentioned that we were sitting at her favorite table and we could see why. Our two top overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the strip. It was great. The tables were far enough apart that we didn't feel too close to other diners.  Food- I read a lot about Scott Conant's famous spaghetti 'baseball,' so we had to try it. Our waiter managed our expectations by explaining that the simplicity of the sauce, herbs and fresh made pasta made it delicious. We split all our dishes and this one was easy to share, as they gave us each our own tiny little ball of pasta. It's not a stretch to say that it is in fact, the best spaghetti I have ever tasted. The consistency was perfect and flavors well-balanced. I can assure you I would never spend over $20 on spaghetti anywhere else, but I'd probably do it again at Scarpetta.  I had my eye on a few meat or fish dishes, but honestly the veggie menu easily tempted this carnivore away. I started with the tuna susci (sushi) and it was some of the best I've had. Each piece almost melted in my mouth and the flavors melded nicely together. I was truly sad when it ended.  My girlfriend had the polenta and we both agreed that it was the creamiest we've ever tasted, without being overly rich. And add truffles to anything and each bite turns into heaven.   We accompanied our spaghetti with another pasta dish off the vegetarian menu, the agnolotti. This was easily my girlfriend's favorite, as each dumpling was filled with (and covered by) the right amount of cheese, cream and truffle. Our meal ended with three warm and perfectly textured zeppole (tiny donuts) and vanilla almond dipping sauce.  The wine pairs were delicious and pours were generous. Our server was down to earth, perfectly attentive (but not overly) and mindful of our needs (both relative to food and time so we could make our show).   It is unusual for me to return to restaurants in Vegas, as there are so many good ones, but Scarpetta will be my exception. The combination of excellent food, service and price make this one of my new favorite dining haunts.",

    "text": "I tried the tasting menu with wine pairing and I nearly died from how full I became.  I ordered the tasting menu because I was unsure about what to chose from the menu - there were quite a few dishes I was torn between and I decided to just give them all a shot since a lot of the items i wanted to try was on the tasting menu.  The food and wine pairing was a great experience.  The service was impeccable - they gave me extra dishes to sample in addition to my tasting menu.  The fresh made potato chips sitting at the bar was also a temptation that I kept on coming back for.    The stand out dishes I tried that night were:  Polenta - wow, never had I had polenta as silky as this before.  The mushrooms and sauce were perfect with the polenta.  I savored every bit of it.  Spaghetti - this definitely hit the spot.  The noodles were hand made and the sauce was quite simple, but elegant.  A very simple dish but I was in love with it.  Short Rib Agnolotti - The first few bites were surprising, but what I loved about it would be the kick the horseradish that was in the sauce gave it.  Each bit teased my tongue and I couldn't help but go back for seconds!  Spiced Duck Breast - My favorite dish from all of the ones I tried that night.  The duck breast was very tender, had a bit of au jus in them and didn't have a game-y taste to it.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection, with the meat being so very tender and the skin having a bit of a crunch to it and the endive and sauce went so well with it.    It was a lovely dining experience.  I wouldn't mind coming again and ordering one of these delightful dishes a la cart.",

    "text": "It was a nice modern style restaurant. The menu noted that the pasta was imported from a place called Scarpetta. (I'll look it up one of these days) The ambience was nice but however it might have been too dark and dim mainly because my eyes started to hurt after awhile. (*I ate with a large group. We were given a private room which was a bonus.)  I ordered a Mediterranean Branzini (fish). It looked beautiful on the plate which is always nice. After taking one bite, I noticed that the skin was extremely crispy but unfortunately the fish came out a bit dry. The dish was really depended on the sauce for it to work for me. The dish was also served with thinly sliced leeks, two tiny shrimps, and two mussels. The shrimp and leeks were delicious but the mussel was a bit gritty. I'm not sure if that's really my thing but the flavor was good though.   This dish was worth a shot but I preferred the dishes that others in my party enjoyed such as short rib Agnalotti, Kobe beef, and some kind of chicken dish. The chicken that I sample was completely moist. I was very surprised and at the time was very jealous that I didn't ordered that instead.  Anyways, there was a complimentary salami/cheese bread in the bread basket. I recommend it. Don't forget to try the creamy dessert of pana cotta and guava. It was very sweet, refreshing, and light.",

While the more complex agnolotti were delicious and certainly worth a repeat order, the best of all were the simplest: spaghetti with tomato and basil; pici with lobster.   Appetizers and meat courses were also terrific, but secondary to the pasta. The one notable exception was a rib cap (cap of the rib eye), which I have never seen on a menu. It was tender, perfectly cooked, and literally bursting with a rich, fatty, beefy flavor.   Service was top notch, though we were in a private room with dedicated wait staff. The bar, though narrow, offered a fine selection of liquors with bartenders who know how to make a decent cocktail. For an aperetif, I strongly recommend the Aperol Spritz.",

The ambiance to begin with, is just gorgeous. You almost can't help but to feel up the soft, velvety walls as you watch the Bellagio fountains go off. Service, as expected is excellent.   And of course the food, wow. From the delicious variety of bread to the spaghetti, as well as the steak were to die for.   What most impressed me, were their portions. It seems as if they know exactly how much a person requires to eat to feel satisfied. For a pasta dish like the spaghetti, you think you are getting a small amount, but take that fork and start eating, and you'll realize that there are endless amount of noodles within that little bowl.  Now, I know that there is a Scarpetta here in LA, but on this lucky night we actually got to eat food prepared by the famous chef Scott Conant himself. I don't know if that makes a big difference or not but after finding out he was our chef, it definitely justified the perfection of our meals.",

    "text": "Bread basket. It has stromboli. Perhaps not the stromboli you order up at a pizza spot, but it is layers of delicious dough and meat. And, this treat was truly the highlight of my meal. If it weren't for that and the beautiful surrounds, the meal would have been a tad disappointing.   Since inhaling about 10 of their yellow tail tuna at Taste of the Nation, I have been eagerly awaiting a trip. Of course, we had an order of yellow tail, and I must say the preparation was better at Taste of the Nation. Not sure how serving it up poolside away from their kitchen could produce a superior product, but the seasoning wasn't singing quite the same tune. Nonetheless, it is still a good dish.   We decided to order the spaghetti because we were told it was featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. The dish was good, but the tomato basil sauce wasn't unexpected. The flavors were delicious, but in a middle of the road way, not a fine dining way. I have had similar sauces at much lesser restaurants that delivered the same gustatory satisfaction for a much lower price point.  If you are going to dine here, I personally think you should skip the spaghetti despite its hype. For my visit, the food overall hovered around a 3, but the space is absolutely gorgeous especially if you get a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Make that happen, and you've got a very promising spot for a date.",

    "text": "Before eating at Scarpetta, my husband and I only knew of Scott Conant as the guy who judges Chopped, hosts that awful 24 hour Restaurant battle show, hates onions, and any dish where you mix fish with cheese.  He also likes to wear extremely tight unbuttoned shirts that makes him look like a distant cousin to the Czech brothers that Dan Aykroyd  and Steve Martin used to play on SNL in the 70s.  But for restaurant week 2011 we stopped by here, lured by the promise of $25 spaghetti so perfectly delicious, that it makes Jesus weep.    Sadly, the spaghetti did not make anyone weep and did not live up to the hype.  In fact, my wonderful husband actually said that my marinara sauce that I routinely rip off from Mario Batali and Anne Burrell, is much better.  I personally was not a fan of the thick noodles, but I thought the sauce on Scott Conant's version was better than mine.  To each their own, really.  But yes I am slightly marking down my rating for the over-hyped food.  Other than that, most of the other dishes were just pretty good, but the  bread basket with the eggplant dip and the truffled mushroom polenta were absolutely spectacular.  Honestly, you could come here and only order the polenta and mooch off the bread basket, and you will have a pretty hearty and filling meal for a decent price.    So I'm happy that Scott Conant's restaurant in Las Vegas was better than I thought it would be, but his Jesus spaghetti is just ok.  .",

The restaurant itself is still outstanding. And the food is great, EXCEPT, one thing just didn't seem the same anymore.  The shortrib appetizer.  All of us at the table agreed that something changed and it really wasn't good.  In fact, it's definitely now something I wouldn't order again.  The meat was dry and the flavor just wasn't there. And as for service, our waiter was nice...but there was a server who continued to hover around our table.  Attentiveness is appreciated but hovering when we're trying to enjoy our dinner was a little annoying.  And my last gripe - I ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert. Normally, the servers set it up for you and show you how to pour the chocolate over, put the toppings, etc.  But nothing.  They just placed this gigantic beautiful souffle in front of me and I stared it at like how am I supposed to eat this.  It was great, but I just thought it was weird that they didn't offer any help.   I still love Scarpetta but ... this night they were a little off.",

We were very disappointed, to say the least.  After some back and forth, the restaurant offered to have us to dine at DOCG (their casual restaurant next door) but order from the Scarpetta menu. Not only that, but since it was their error, they said they would comp the food and we would just pay for our wine and other drinks. We were skeptical about the level of food they would offer, but frankly the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  They cheerfully brought us generous samplings from their appetizer and pasta menus and then we each chose an entree. Then they brought several selections from the dessert menu to finish. Dishes were uniformly delicious, and the wine service from Noe and the staff was first rate with a number of fantastic suggestions.   Our entire team went home happy and the restaurant honored their offer to make us whole.   We will definitely return the next time a trade show brings us to Vegas and I will seek out the Beverly Hills location, too. Great job, Scarpetta.",

The decor is intimate yet trendy - as you walk into the restaurant along the bar there are several tables set into nooks along the wall which seem pretty cool.  The main dining room is full of comfortable tables although the aisles do get a bit crowded from time to time.  The service was good.  Our waiter was a bit verbose and over-the-top with his descriptions of the menu items but he provided answers to our questions and recommendations throughout the meal.  The food is the real star of the show here.  It was outstanding from the bread basket through dessert.  We ordered several appetizers including the polenta mushroom soup (creamy and rich), the beet salad, and the braised short ribs (outstanding flavor and cooked perfectly).  Several of us ordered the spaghetti for dinner and really enjoyed it - the sauce was nice and light and the basil really popped in the dish.  We also commented on the quality of the homemade pasta noodles.  A simple yet well done dish.  Others had the ravioli and tortellini dishes which were equally good.  For dessert they offer a banana and nutella dish with doughnuts.  This dessert is not to be underestimated - it was fantastic!  We also ordered the chocolate cake dessert which was very rich and full of chocolate goodness as well.  I highly recommend Scarpetta for dinner if you are in Vegas, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Meh!  I have several criteria for good Italian cuisine.  Firstly, it has to taste good.  That being said, everyone has a different take on what \"good\" means.  That is the basis for this discussion.  Although the flavors were savory, there was a lack of complexity.  Expectations for me were also HIGH since this place is expensive.  When you start with high expectations, you are bound to be disappointed.  The signature spaghetti was flavorful, but not out of this world, but again a personal opinion.  The veal was good.  Was it worth the cost? Not in my opinion.  If you take all of the dishes and drop the price by 50%, then it becomes a good Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "Let me first say that I went to Scarpetta just to try their dessert.  My friend and I had eaten dinner at a nearby restaurant in Cosmopolitan and wanted to try another place for dessert.  We first checked out the menu posted right outside the door of the restaurant and figured that the desserts sounded tasty so we should give it a shot.  When we first went in, they asked for our reservation.  We did not have any, so we elected to sit in one of the booths near the bar.  For dessert, I ordered the Peach Crostata since I really like peaches.  The dessert was described as moscato peaches, almonds, cinnamon and cardemom gelato.  It came in a clear glass.  I was expecting the dessert to be very sweet and savory, but it wasn't really any of those.  It wasn't anything extraordinary.  It just tasted like a regular dessert.  I understand that most customers do not come here just for dessert, but I figured with the great reviews and pricing that it would be something worth trying.  I guess I was wrong.  Maybe their food is better than their desserts, but there wasn't anything special on this end.",

    "text": "Great view of the Bellagio fountains, romantical, ok food....  Located in the Cosmo, my man took me here for my birthday, so I would love to give this place a 5.  But we both agreed for how much you're paying, the food is just ok.  Service was attentive and our waiter made recommendations on the menu.  The ambiance is nice and of course if you can snag a table by the window, you'll have a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains.  *Complimentary bread basket with three different types of dipping oil:  citrus infused olive oil, eggplant, and mascarpone butter.  Would have been nice if the bread was warm.  The eggplant and mascarpone butter is soooo good.  *Short rib agnolotti-  little tortellinis stuffed with short rib in a brown butter  horseradish sauce topped with bread crumbs.    I love short rib so I had to order this.  I could hardly see let alone taste the short rib and the dish seemed like it was drenched in horseradish, making it really strong.  I don't mind some but wow I felt like it was coming out of my nose.  *Ribeye of beef- I laugh because I don't know why my man decided to order a steak at a Italian restaurant, but he was just in the mood for one.  But basically it was average, nothing wow.  Stick to Italian.  * Zepole- Nutella filled donuts topped with candied hazelnuts  with a vanilla dipping sauce.  O.m.g. Sooo deelish.  I don't know if I\"d come back but if I did I'd try the spaghetti.  Small little bowl of simple pasta for 24 bucks, but everyone keeps raving about it and even our waiter recommended it.  So it must have some kick ass sauce and noodles...",

    "text": "After reading all the reviews here, I decided to try the fantastic Pasta place that Yelpers are craving about.  The restaurant is located on the third floor at Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is an easy find once you reach there.  It's a nice high end restaurant and you can pick the window seat so you get to overlook the Bellagio fountain.  We are a huge party so I get to try couple different appetizers and main dish.  I have to say, it is a total disappointment.  Not to bash on their food because the food actually  taste from ok to good, but the food does not taste like the level when you are spending 50 dollars a person.  It lacks that \"wow\" factor.    To further breakdown the night, there are two things that wowed me.  First, is their salami bread, it is really tasty and you rarely see it from any other restaurant. Second, is their creamy polenta, you need to eat it while its hot and it is delicious.  However, all the other dishes are mediocre at best.  I ordered the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli, and it is SO SALTY.  I love salty food and always add extra pepper and salt on my french fries, and even I have a hard time taking on the saltiness of its Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli.  Also, their tomato & basil spaghetti is very plain.  Taste good if it is $15, but not at $24.    One worst part is their restroom.  They have 1 female and 1 male restroom, and you can only use it one person at a time.  So, during the night, people kept waiting in line for restroom.  I understand the fact that you can exit the restaurant and there is another Cosmopolitan restroom outside, but isn't it a little absurd when you have only one bathroom stall in the restaurant.    Overall, it is not my best Vegas restaurant experience, I would rate it somewhere between 2.5 stars to 3 stars.",

    "text": "One of the best meals of my life.  I will preface the review by saying that we got the supreme hook up.  I am an acquaintance of Chef Dan Rossi and he saw to it that we experienced Scarpetta to the fullest.  A huge thank you again to Chef Dan and his hospitality and talented team.  The atmosphere: Sleek, elegant, and sexy are the first words that come to mind.  The sound track puts you in the right mood but doesn't overwhelm.  One of the few hot spots in Vegas where you don't have to shout to your dinner companions- I greatly appreciated this.  It is warm and inviting with these great S shaped booths.  Yes, the waiters appear over your sholder when you're dining at the booths, but I didnt really mind that.  The food: I do not exagerate, one of the best meals of my life! A break down- Polenta with mushrooms- I could have drank that sauce and been satisfied, my bf who doesnt even like polenta went back for seconds and thirds! Heirloom tomato salad- simple, clean, delicious Yellowtail carpaccio- i dont know how they get fish this fresh in Vegas! Light citrusy sauce with some crunch from the salt on top. Perfection. Short ribs- I dont usually eat meat but when i saw that these babies basically fall off the bone as soon as a fork comes near, i had to try.  Taglietelle with veggies and truffle cream- this is not a light dish! The homemade pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and the sauce is everything that something with truffles should be.  My bf's fave of the night. Short rib ravioli- a special that night.  Again, I'm vegetarian and this was my fave dish.  It its offered when you go, dont miss it.  Branzino with leeks and asparagus- light and refreshing after the heavier pastas.  Crispy skin on the fish. Leeks roasted till they carmelized.  I could eat this every night and be a happy girl.  Gingerbread and pear tarte with cinnamon gelato- ORDER IT!!!!  I'm not usually this long winded in reviews but I was just so happy with the entire evening.  In addition wines by the glass are generously poured and therefore worth the steep-ish price.  I'd recommend this as a place for couples, non-rowdy bday parties, and those looking for an elegant evening without a bass infused club sound track.  Thank you, thank you Chef Rossi.",

    "text": "I know this is an Italian restaurant and we really came here for the spaghetti BUT what blew me away was the bread basket. Yes, something as simple as a bread basket was quite possibly the highlight of our meals.   I went with 2 girlfriends and decided on one duck and foie gras ravioli, one spaghetti, and one tagliatelle for our meals and a polenta with mushroom fricasee to share. So we're waiting for our food and they bring out the bread basket and some butter, olive oil, and eggplant tapenade. Ok, pretty standard. But once we opened up that napkin, we were pleasantly surprised with stromboli, rosemary bread, and biscuits piping hot from the oven! The stromboli was a perfect blend of crispy outside and soft buttery inside, with the salami and cheese adding the perfect amount of salt. If that wasn't good enough, the rosemary bread. WOW. I absolutely love rosemary though so I may be biased. Anyway, we asked for another basket of bread and polished that one off long before our appetizer even touched down on the table.   To start, we ordered the polenta with mushrooms and our server told us it was just a small bite meant for one person, but the 3 of us were able to share it without wanting more. At this point we were already getting full! Finally our entrees came and everything was on point. The rich duck/foie gras ravioli, the clean but complicated flavors of the spaghetti, and the fresh, crisp spring veggie tagliatelle. Amazing. You really can't beat fresh pasta. I paired my meal with their pinot noir which was a great complement but I barely even remembered to drink it because I was so enamored with the food. Next time, I may try not to eat as much bread...oh who am I kidding. It's too good!",

We were late about 15 min. but we called ahead to let them know and they were cool about it.  Some things we ordered: -Calamari: thinly cut and deliciously flaky and salty. -Yellowtail Appetizer: nicely flavored but oh-so not enough!  5 thin pieces -Scallops: meh but then again I'm not a fan of scallops -Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli:  extremely rich, definitely get as appetizer and not an entree -Black Farfalle: the presentation didn't look that appealing cuz it is literally a dish of black pasta, but taste-wise it was pretty good; small but sufficient amounts of maine lobster -Halibut: on the drier side -Stracchi: interestingly small squares of flat pasta -Desserts: Napoleon was popular with the group, Zeppole was so-so, Chocolate Cake was really rich but imo yummiest of all the desserts, and lastly....the Cheesecake....BLECH!  Description of the Cheesecake dessert on the menu...\"Cheesecake.  Mango Granita, Pistachio Brittle\".  When you order cheesecake, you expect to get a sweet creamy cake made from cream cheese, right?  Not here!  It's GOAT CHEESE people!  So if you like goat cheese cheesecake you'll love the cheesecake at Scarpetta.  Most of the food was actually pretty good (4 stars worth) but because the stupid bald older waiter of ours failed to tell 2 of us who ordered the cheesecake that it is made from goat cheese, AND THEN proceeded to argue w/ me saying that \"goat cheese\" was written on the menu...uh NO it was not, can you read English?!...that took it down a notch for me.  Not sure I'd go back myself.  If I do, I'll make sure not to have that guy wait on me again.",

After doing the math, we decided to go with the wine and food pairing dinner fat $85. for the food and $45. for the wine (about six courses).  If you order off the menu and consider appitizer, entree, dessert and wine, this is at least a push if not a better deal.  Waiter seconded our decision as a good deal and the night began!  Each course of food was presented with a different wine with a short explanation of each.  The flavors were described both before trying the wine with the food and what we should expect after trying it with the food.  The entire meal lasted about two hours and each dish was unique in both presentation and flavor.  If anything, we'd suggest maybe some sorbet between one or two courses for cleansing and maybe take just a little bit more time.  Five or six (we can't remember because even with about a 3 oz serving of wine, that's a lot of grape to consume!) is courses is a bunch of food and even at two hours, it was a lttile bit rushed.  Waiter was very nice, buss service great.  Lot's of corporate types having dinner, I would like to have seen management pay more attention to the guests and the somm never said hello although he was paying tons of attention to an apparient high roller next to us.  All-in-all I would recommend this place to anyone who will listen and also our stay at the Cosmopolitan was fantastic!  Very cool place, great bars, wonderful pools.  Do yourself a favor and rent a cabana, #5 is the best one to get.  Enjoy!",

We originally had reservations for Nob Hill but we decided at the last minute to eat here.    First of all, the seats had soft plush leather.  Luxurious. You know you're in for a treat.  The lighting was perfectly dim. Not too dim you can't even see your hands like some other places.   The food, the wine, desserts, service is top notch.  Wine was perfect temperature according to one of our diners. Well, the server asked if it was the right temperature before serving it (that was nice touch!), it was a little warm but no problem, he came back and gave us the right one.  We had from what I can remember, Braised Short Ribs of Beef. (Hey you know this was cooked for a long time, I'm not a chef so I don't know this but the taste had a lot of levels to it) Roasted Sea Scallops that I want to eat forever. Biggest surprise was the Spaghetti. I've never had this pasta before.  It was thicker, definitely cooked right and the sauce was heavenly. We had to order 2 plates of it.  Agnalotti which had guess what in it? I don't know. It doesn't matter, it was terrific.  Everyone picked on my plate when I ordered that one. Then for dinner Black Cod which was cooked to perfection. I'm in love. Where's the heart icon here on Yelp?    For dessert, we ordered everything they had and the waiter wrote \"happy birthday\" on my plate with chocolate souffle. Sorry I didn't eat the other desserts but they were all raving about it.    First time I had this type of Pinot Noir. Seaport? Not sure about the name but I didn't get a headache the next day. We were out until 3 am. We went to Marquee, got in, right away and didn't have to get in line (maybe because we had dinner at Scarpetta?) and I was up cheery eyed at 9:30 the next day.",

    "text": "Scarpetta is renowned Italian Chef Scott Conant's masterpiece. There are five throughout the U.S. - New York, Miami, Las Vegas (in the Cosmopolitan), Toronto, and Beverly Hills. I first heard about Scarpetta from my boyfriend's sister, as we both like to watch Conant on Chopped on the Food Network.   We started the night off with two cocktails - Scarselli and Dolce Limone. Good, as always. They gave us complimentary bread: sourdough, french, rosemary, and a stromboli. Along with the bread were marscapone butter, eggplant and tomato-herb spread, and a citrus-infused olive oil. The stromboli was definitely the best, but the eggplant/tomato-herb spread was really good. As our appetizer, we chose the Tuna 'Susci' ($16), which as you can see is raw tuna wrapped around vegetables. The tart-marinated vegetables complimented the fresh tuna very well.  After reading so many good things about the spaghetti, I had to find out if this is really the best pasta you will ever have. Usually, I am disappointed with certain dishes because people have hyped them up way too much. But for once, the spaghetti ($24) lived up to its hype. Wow, I honestly can't believe spaghetti could taste this good. The pasta is cooked to perfection - consistency, texture, taste - everything was on point. Then there's the sauce, ahhhhh. You can taste the fresh tomatos and the basil in every single bite. I am speechless, really.  Although the spaghetti was definitely the highlight of the night, the duck and foie gras ravioli ($25) comes pretty close. Once again, the ravioli was cooked perfectly (as expected). But what really made this dish stand out was the filling. Duck - check. Foie Gras - check. Can you ask for anything more? Two of some of my favorite things to eat are mixed together and stuffed into a ravioli. It is the right amount of duck and the right amount of foie gras - not overpowering at all. The marsala reduction adds a nice and clean finishing touch to this already, perfect dish.  As for dessert, we opted for the chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The cake was just like every other molten chocolate cake, but the toasted almond gelato and the salted caramel sauce was goooooood. I wouldn't order it again, only because I would want to try their other desserts.  For two cocktails, a beer, an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert, our bill came out to be about $125. Not that bad considering all the food and drinks we got. The entrees may seem pricey (especially the spaghetti), but you actually get a good amount in one order. When I come back (hopefully soon), I would definitely get the spaghetti again. Everything else, I would switch out only so I can try other items on their menu. But if it is your first time going, I highly recommend the spaghetti and the ravioli. Then, you can also say you just had the best spaghetti in your entire life!",

    "text": "I was very excited to try Scarpetta because I had read great reviews for the New York and Beverly HIlls locations. At best the food was uninteresting.  The first course was cold, the second course was barely warm (the pasta was dry as if it had been sitting around) and the third course was just warm but tasted awful. It was described to me as being a slow roasted baby goat.. sounded delicious. When it came, it was dry, tough and overly gamey. I usually love gamey meat, lamb, duck,etc... I sent it back, which I've only ever done twice before. The assistant manager came by to tell me that the goats they've been getting in are smaller than they should be and don't have enough fat on them. So why is this goat still on the menu?  I've eaten at some really great places  (Hatfield's, Eleven Madison, Lucques, Bouchon, ...) and am more than willing to spend money on a great meal. This is NOT in that category of restaurant. It's really lame to be charging those prices for such mediocre (at best) food.",

We started off with the wagyu beef tartare and the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. The polenta was unbelievably creamy and luxurious!  Then my friends and I ordered the tagliatelle, duck & foie gras ravioli, short rib agnolotti, and colorado lamb loin done medium rare. Everything was delicious, especially the lamb. The best part of the night was surprisingly the stromboli that was part of the bread basket at the beginning of the meal - buttery, fluffy slices of bread that was stuffed with salami & cheese. I am going back just for that bread!",

The host was very accomodating but we had to wait 30-45mins for a table... not that big of a deal but I was starving! Ambience is nice, could be very romantic. However, we were seated right under the ac vent and it was fuhreezingggg  - Braised Short Rib - the beef was soo tender and flavorful. I definitely recommend this as an appetizer. The risotto was good in texture, however wasn't too crazy about the vegetable medley they had in there.  - Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - I liked this pasta the best (of what I tried). It just seemed weird that the agnolotti seemed to be cut in half, is that normal? In any case, rich in flavor, the short rib was good and went well with the sauce.  - Ravioli - I can't find it on their menu online.. but it was delicious and had burst of great truffle flavor. Very creamy though and not sure I would be able to eat a whole entree of this myself. But definitely worth a try for anyone who isn't scared of cream & cheese!  Oh yea, and the house bread... BOMB. So goood. Each slice was like a surprise, either with basil(?) or bacon and served with butter (of course), olive oil, and a bruschetta type spread that was very fresh and light.  Overall, very happy with the experience -- but it could also be because i was super hangry :)",

    "text": "(1st review of 2013!)  My goodness, Scott Conant - you gave us THE best meal in Vegas, EVER!  Located in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Scarpetta's chic, dark, ambience welcomes you and your party (I observed some ranging from business meetings to bachelorette parties and everything in between, with different types of seating arrangements to  match) and the vibe was always cool and collected. The service felt disconnected - I would've removed 1 star because of that, but the food was so superb that I won't! We didn't have reservations because it was a last minute decision to dine there, but we were seated right away regardless.  We skipped appetizers and went straight for the entrees. My eyes went straight to the DUCK & FOIS GRAS RAVIOLI! My heart jumped for joy realizing that fois gras is completely legal to sell here! I ordered it and it was the right decision! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the savory filling had a creamy texture that was bursting with flavor. It was like the perfect marriage of poultry and red meat flavor. Definitely unforgettable! My husband enjoyed his TAGLIATELLE (with fall vegetables, truffle zabaglione & guanciale) - it was very comforting and hearty.  We were full, but were able to make room for dessert: NUTELLA AND VANILLA CREME BOMBOLONI which consisted of Nutella ganache, caramalized bananas & Nutella powder. WOW! The bomboloni (like donut holes) were lovely fluffy and crispy, filled with either chocolate or vanilla cream. The bananas were fantastic, as were the ganache and powder, adding decadent levels of texture.  So glad our impromptu evening of dining led us to Scarpetta. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

Good atmosphere and ambience.  Food wise, it was awesome! I don't hate Italian food but it is not something that I am a big fan of. But I loved the Italian food here at Scarpetta! I think I had the best pasta in my life here! I tried different Italian places in the past that made homemade fresh pasta, but they aren't as good as the homemade pasta here at Scarpetta! I am impressed! I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it tasted great!  My husband's veal ragu fettuccine was awesome too. We loved them a lot. At the end, I had a strawberry souffle and my husband's had a dessert that I don't remember the exact name. From my memory, his dessert tasted good and had an interesting presentation. Anyway, my souffle was awesome, I think it was the best I had by far, better than what I had in other French restaurants in the past (e.g. Andres, Eiffel). Everything was awesome. We became a fan. Highly recommend this place to yelpers! At the end, they also gave us some sweet treats for our anniversary. Those tasted good too!",

When I mentioned I was vegetarian, I was provided with a special vegetarian menu, with a couple of additional items not on the regular menu. (this is not exactly a positive. Put all your dishes on the menu. I mean, you aren't actually starting to cook your farro for the farro risotto when a random vegetarian offers it, right?)  I was drawn to the restaurant by the marketing copy. (it's impressive!) The burrata salad made me add it to my very short -must-try-while-in-Vegas list. And it did not disappoint. I have a running pet peeve about chintzy servings of burrata, and this is possibly the first place I've eaten that provided a balanced proportion of tomato and burrata. The variety of heirloom tomatoes, served roasted, and fresh, was a wonderful surprise. And there was enough burrata (lightly salted with shaved crystal salt) for every bite of the dish. Divine.  Two other stellar standouts (aside from the view of the Bellagio fountain show) were the olive oil served with the table bread-- some of the best I've ever had-- and the dessert. We split the Bomboloni, and it was divine. My description will not do it justice, but I'll try. Essentially, 5 small donuts covered in crystal sugar, and filled with Nutella, served with a heavenly banana gelato.  All that, and in a peaceful oasis of a casino hotel that barely forces you to cross the casino floor, and makes it easy to enter and leave the building. I'll be back, should I find myself in Vegas ever again.",

    "text": "Simply put Scarpetta is my favorite Vegas restaurant.  I've been a few times and each time I've left as satisfied as possible.   For an appetizer, I've had the squash soup, the tuna susci, and braised short ribs. The squash soup is some of the best I've ever had. The tuna was good but I wouldn't get it again. The braised short ribs were perfect and while I have no idea what was in that sauce, it was heavenly. Probably will get the braised short ribs the next few times I go.  As for entrees, they are famous for their duck and foie gras ravioli and believe me, it lives up to the loftiest of expectations. It's such a unique dish and the duck and foie gras compliment each other perfectly. It doesn't feel too heavy, goes down sooooo smoothly and has this great sauce on top with just the perfect amount of cheese. Ive had it multiple times and plan on getting it again in the future.  I've also had the short rib agnolottie which is almost as superb. The short rib is great and you get this really tasty hint of horseradish in the sauce. It's far from overwhelming, just a hint of it, but after a full plate of the agnolotti, you can certainly tell its there. But it doesn't take away from the dish, the short rib and pasta are both great. While I've not tried the black cod or the steak, my companions have and they have reported being very happy with their choices.  Oddly enough, I've not had dessert at Scarpetta. Maybe in the future I will, I'm sure it will be tasty.  A few other things to note: the view is superb, definitely ask for a window seat and you'll get a side view of the bellagio fountains. It's just a matter of luck and if they have a table available, ask when you make the reservation. The portions are great. So often Vegas portions (especially at nice restaurants) are so small, but these are adequate and leaves you filling full but not overly full (as often dishes are so heavy with fat and cream and such). The price is very appropriate. Nothing is exorbitantly pricy, nothing is cheap, the price is correct.",

    "text": "The BF and I had trouble deciding where to go for our anniversary and he had put me to the task of finding a place with a scallop appetizer and a solid light white fish entree and Scarpetta won out in our short lists of places that fit the bill.   I love the 50's low lights and bold dark wood grain used in the restaurant. We were seated by the windows to witness a rainy and moody sky (which I happen to like). People said this is a nice view...but there is a large partition on the windows and it happens to be at eye level.  I cant see the water, only the top of the spray of the Bellagio show. It defeated the purpose a little bit....  STARTERS  We started off with the raved about bread basket. There was a stromboli in there rolled with cheeses and salami that was delicious. If I could order that at the lounge I would. There was also sourdough slice, a bread roll, 2 herbed foccacia squares. They give a trio of butter, a eggplant caponata and citrus infused oil. Caponata was lovely and all the bread was warm, soft and nicely crusty.  ROASTED SEA SCALLOPS- which they split onto two presentations for each of us to have one. It was a very fresh scallop, nicely seared. There was a light spice that came through as you chewed it, capers and bottarga on top gave some briny flavor, micro green some bitterness and salmoriglio made for a nice creamy sauce to it. It was served on top of a steak of cauliflower that was nicely roasted.   DUCK AND FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with marsala reduction - was one I was very curious about since many rave about this and the spaghetti. I've had the spaghetti before in LA (and did not weep) and now that I actually know the Scarpetta recipe and have replicated it, I wanted to know if something else was rave worthy. This was tasty, but it was just a bit TOO rich for such a big plate of it.  Some may love a whole heap, but I'm glad it was split as a appetizer...and still there was too many for us. We're freegetarians ( semi vegetarians) and don't really have many rich foods since switching over to the dark side..  ENTREE  MEDITERRANEAN BRANZINO - Came with 2 nice sized filets with nicely crisp skin and beautifully flaky meat. If came with a bed of braised leeks, celery root, shrimps, clams and mussels and had a seafood broth reduction as a sauce so it was very clean, sea flavors going on here.  BLACK COD - fish was nice and buttery, with a herbaceous,somewhat anise tasting, tomato glaze and micro chives. It had caramelized fennel & roasted tomato to go with. I've always had black cod aka butterfish in a Asian preparation so this was interesting to try something different.   The BF preferred the Branzino and so did I.  DESSERT   ZEPPOLE - with nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts was divine. These were rich pillows of heaven. I love zeppoles and beignets of all kinds and this is among the best I've had. Will come back. Just for these.   BROWN BUTTER HAZELNUT CAKE - the name makes it sound like it would be more brown buttery cakey thing, but it truly was more about the lemon curd, meringue. I'm slowly growing to like lemon desserts and this was good enough to make me believe in it. It had olive oil gelato & candied hazelnuts to go which gave a light savory aspect to it. This was a great choice to balance out the zeppole since those were just dense and this was bright.   Service was decent. There was a mixup with the kitchen and our appetizers went to the wrong table at first, back to the kitchen and eventually to us. Service cleared plates and refilled drinks quite frequently and checked on us. A little weird note but in the area we were seated the chef was coming around and talking to tables and even serving one of the tables around us. I guess good that there are regulars but found little awkward as well.   It was a solid choice for dinner and went home happy. I see they have a vegetarian menu and have a nice lounge area so I would consider coming back for a snack there and those zeppoles...I don't know if I would do a \"all out\" dinner here again though.  The night after our dinner here we went to a establishment off strip and the flavor and quality was on par with better prices, vibe and surpasses in service.   Overall, Scott Conants place is solid for the Strip and I'm glad it is here, but it was surprisingly not the star of our weekend.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to dine here for our 5 year Anniversary, the food was very good but the service was not what I was expecting given that it is considered a fine dining restaurant. The waiter seemed to busy with his older guests and barley checked on our table. It was our first time going to the restaurant and the waiter did not explain the menu at all, he just dropped off the menus and then came back around later and asked if we were ready to order. When the dessert came I was expecting something written on it saying Happy Anniversary, but unfortunately there was nothing written on our plate. It was pretty disappointing, it was our 5 years and we were hoping to celebrate it at a nice place together. My boyfriend and I are younger than the clientele that was their, so maybe that was why the server did not pay attention to our table, but if that is the case they should really reconsider who they are hiring to work for their restaurant. The hostess and busser were very nice and friendlier than our server.",

    "text": "Food: Foie Gras duck ravioli:  a mediocre sized dish, with oily ravioli stuffed with slim slivers of duck breast and foie gras. maybe foie gras is not meant to be cooked, but it was not a 5 star experience. despite my description it was good, but not great. I would expect more for what i am paying.   BBQ ribs and bone marrow pasta: another ok meal, with the small chunks of meat in them.   Seared scallop: VERY delicious. this was a wonderful appetizer, it set the par at which i was expecting the rest of the food to be at, unfortunately nothing did. Very juicy, and the bacon wrapping it was just the right amount of crispy.  Service: I Hated the service, we had some snobby waiter that was quite rude. no help with description of food, not even a smile. I just didn't like him. Our waters were refilled once. this is a fine dining restaurant, I expect my water to be filled each time i reach half way. For Las Vegas standards this place FAILED miserably. I sit at the far end of restaurant in Bachi burger and my water gets filled constantly. any restaurant, fine dining or not, the people serve with a smile. the food runners were nice enough though. the service did not meet the standards one would expect at a restaurant like this.  The restaurant: we had a pretty nice view of the Bellagio water works. we were one table away from the window, but it was still nice. the decor was nice too, i liked the way set up, the tables seemed to be stacked higher and higher as they went away from the window. chandeliers were very fancy. the decor met vegas standards.   all in all probably not going back, not worth the money.",

They were 6 delicious courses, so glad we didn't eat lunch and that we were told not to eat the bread.  We would not have been able to finish if we had eaten the bread.  Jason and Elaina our wait staff, took very good care of us all night.  We did not want for anything during the meal.  It was a very very nice evening.  My favorite course was the short rib agnolotti, and my husband loved the scallop with foie gras and polenta.  The salted caramel sauce was so good I asked for a bowl to dip my cake in.  The dessert wine was a little weird for us but all of the other wine selections were perfect.    We will be back for another big event, we enjoyed our evening that much.  Thank you Scarpetta for making this special evening so memorable.",

    "text": "I ate here last night and boyfriend and I decided on the tasting menu! It was about 6 different courses, each with amazing flavor. The bread basket and dippings that come with were so good I had to restrain myself from gobbling it all up too quickly. The cocktails were way better than expected too. I had the Scarpetta Cosmo since we were at the Cosmo. :)  I think our favorite course might have been the ravioli and spaghetti? No, wait, definitely the creamy polenta. GET THE POLENTA. And the starter of tuna and yellowtail was phenomenal. There was also cod served and duck breast, which were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, but I was getting so full at that point that I gave up midway through the duck. The ending dessert was a rich dark chocolate cake with gelato. They switched out the flavor of gelato for my boyfriend due to a nut allergy and were really accommodating. And they gave us some kind of pineapple cream in lava soup? That tasted like it came straight from Hawaii and the man doesn't even like bits of fruit in his food but helped me eat all of this one.  Everything was perfect! We left more full than we expected off of a tasting menu! Service was great and very informative.",

    "text": "Sat at the bar- waiter recommended the octopus salad off the regular menu as a light option. It was tasty- had beans similar to fava and a tasty hummus like paste under the octopus, which was likely pan seared. There were also some half sliced baby tomatoes and Brussels sprouts which were seasoned well. It was also happy hour, so I ordered the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti- it was completely delicious!!! It's very rich, close to being a little over oiled, but tastes amazing! They highly recommended the duck ravioli also, said its better but a little heavier. Will definitely order next time. The portion is half what the full dinner portion is, and I found it perfect. Most people could order 2 items off happy hour, which are $7 a piece, and feel satisfied as a meal- order 3 if you're really hungry. They had some cool specialty cocktails on HH all for $7 also, with two beers and their choice of a red and white wine. The best happy hour I've seen at Cosmo! Atmosphere is quaint and romantic. Excited to go back to try more options!",

    "text": "The final meal of our Vegas escapade was well spent at Scarpetta. It wasn't completely perfect but most of the night made up for the little missteps (we'll get to that later) so for the most part, I had nothing but a good time. Attentive service, rich indulgent food, all housed within an intimate space with gorgeous views of the Ballagio fountains, we closed our trip in pure hedonistic style.  We started with some of their signature cocktails as we browsed the menu. Upon the recommendation from our fantastic server, and the joys of libation, we decided on the tasting menu ($99) and accompanying wine pairing ($49) since several of the dishes that we wanted to try were on it anyway and boy did we pick right. That was the beginning of six courses of pure pleasure.  We started with a sashimi plate (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=YvhgCFf5CQSIopYC83uWwA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) which consisted of yellowtail with a drizzle of ginger oil and red onions. The other half of the plate sat the tuna susci - tuna wrapped marinated vegetables. The fish was so fresh and the flavors were delicately balanced. The bread basket came shortly after and there was a nice selection including yummy foccacia and stromboli. As part of the tasting menu, the chef also threw in a couple of surprises and we were treated to a delightful seafood fritto misto for this course. Perfectly crispy fried but not oily, every bite was yummy and the rock shrimp just melted in my mouth.    The next course was a perfectly roasted sea scallop. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=06QYvnXBie8HfTnYKN4OBw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) It was a joy to eat and the velvety salmoriglio sauce was a nice accompaniment to the sweet and juicy scallop. The chef's extra this course was a polenta with a truffle mushroom stew. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=gtRWGpR4xggHmw0rVryaNw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) For the record I hate cornmeal and thus hate grits, tamales, and polenta. Yet, I could not stop eating this polenta. The flavors of the mushroom stew combine with the impeccably smooth polenta. (I suspect there's a whole lot more butter in it than what Chef Scott Conant lets on) It was a nice double headliner with the scallop.   Next up was the pasta course and Chef Conant's signature tomato & basil spaghetti. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=JQRLJQ4G8BgIzxS0bC8Bow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) Fresh made pasta in a simple tomato basil (+ quarter stick of butter) sauce but just perfectly executed. While I thoroughly enjoyed it, the chef's extra this course, the short rib agnolotti with brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=wzfcOlEkTVylois628h_Ag\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>), totally blew my mind. Wow who would have thought that the combination of short ribs, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs could be so sublime? I miss it already as I speak.   The next course was the black cod. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=2TmOcEavT5T4aeu8J6ItRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) Again perfectly seared but wonderfully moist in the middle. The fatty fish absolutely stands out against the sauce and caramelized fennel. Delicious. The next entree course was a the duck breast. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=BR1FRH72URaVJtrhiq6w-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) While this was my least favorite dish of the night, it was still absolutely delicious which tells you the quality of the food all night. The orange and spices (I kept picking up 5 spice) worked well with gamy duck. All in all, a successful combination.   Final course and dessert was a chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and caramel. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmTwqYEQiKErDv4a55obg?select=uDi5aPZQgQwUQcGjVUkoSg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0NmT...</a>) This is where I really had to throw in the towel after all that eating. The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent and I could only finish half of it but I just couldn't let the toasted almond gelato go to waste. It was just delicious. You can totally taste the toasted flavor.   Now on to the kink of the night. Since we were seated by the wine cellar, the sommelier came by several times to retrieve bottles of wine. Each single time, he let the door hit me as I was eating without even acknowledging it, much less apologize. Not that it was a deal breaker but you expect a little more basic courtesy especially when you're dropping good money on dinner.   Still for a wonderfully decadent meal paired with friendly and attentive service, we had a good time and I strongly recommend Scarpetta if you want to treat yourself to a fine meal on the strip.",

I come to a nice restaurant to be treated with respect and not looked down because of my age. I understand we look young and you may think that we won't tip you well but I'm in the bar industry and he would have gotten well taken care of, for sure. I always tip well. He had overheard me talking to my girls about the situation and then tried to not have me pay for the wine to make up for it, without saying something about the horrible service. It's very upsetting when you expect good service and you get belittled.",

The restaurant is nice inside the Cosmopolitan but the food was extremely small portioned.  I paid $35 for appetizer special of the day: 2 scallops!  For entree I had the scriti pasta dish.  Good squid ink but very bland in seasoning and also very scant for the price.  Service was good waiter was attentive.  Ambiance left something to be desired.  Someone puked in the ladies bathroom and wasn't cleaned.    Skip this place and go elsewhere!",

In LV we had the duck & foie gras ravioli, the beet salad, the uni & lobster tagliolini, and the branzino. Everything came out perfect. My fave of the night was definitely the uni & lobster pasta -- SO GOOD. Creamy but not overly rich, and the roe added nice texture to the dish. Can't wait to come back to this restaurant! FYI, corkage fee is $35.",

Bread basket was spot on. The eggplant spread is delicious and the salami & cheese bread was so salty and savoy and addicting!! Water glasses were continuously being refilled and service was top notch.  We ordered the tomahawk steak, 2 orders of the pici pasta w lobster, and the short rib agnolotti. All dishes were good but overall not as memorable as the bread. The flavor of the pici was nice and there was a lot of lobster meat which is plus but the pasta was a little too chewy for the group. The short rib was yummy, very rich. The tomahawk was a little too fatty for some of the girls in the group (Ricardo had warned us of fat marbling due to it being a ribeye). The real stars of the meal were the accompaniments of the tomahawk - the roasted on the vine tomatoes and the cheesy risotto balls! Both were excellent!!!  A cookie plate was delivered complimentary for the Bride-to-be. However we should have ordered a dessert because they all looked really good.  Decor is lovely and view of the Bellagio fountains is the primary reason i choose this restaurant.",

(No joke...I went to the restroom by the entrance and some girl had tossed her cookies alllll over the floor.) I mention this because I felt like the Cosmopolitan was starting to lose its appeal for me. It's definitely a different crowd from what it opened to a couple of years ago.  But Scarpetta has really turned it around for me.  I'd been wanting to go to Scarpetta in LA for awhile so I was SUPER excited when we came upon this location after finding a long wait at Jaleo. Since it was a Saturday night, we decided to push our luck and ended up with a booth tucked away in the lounge/bar. Perfect.   The service was amazing from the get-go. Started off with the delicious Gallardo with Hendricks for me, and a proper margarita for my man. We were starving so we inhaled our bread basket of rosemary foccacia and stromboli with marscapone butter and eggplant cabonata. That right there? Best bread basket EVER. Moved on to the most amazing, melts in your mouth short ribs over a bed of farro and veggies. Originally, the farro was for me and the short ribs for my bf but I had to take a bite when I saw his eyes roll over. Then onto our entrees of spaghetti and Colorado lamb. I have to admit, that spaghetti was super overhyped for me. I really liked it, but I expected too much for a simple plate of well executed pasta with tomato sauce. Don't get me wrong...it was delicious, but I'd choose differently next time. The lamb was, however, declared the best lamb he'd ever had.  We were stuffed by then but we couldn't resist dessert. I chose the browned butter cake with figs and poached pears because I just wanted the pears, heh. Our awesome server brought me a taste of aperol to pair with it - what a perfect way to end our meal.  When we were discussing our fave meals from the weekend, we both agreed this was by far the best. In fact, I'll go as far as saying it was one of my best meals in Vegas ever. Thanks for an amazing time, Scarpetta.",

We ordered a variety of steaks, pork chops, and duck, and the food was good and prepared to order, but the flavor was noticeably lacking. The most flavorful item we had was the side dish of homemade pasta. That is a sad statement considering that is a side dish on a fairly robust menu. I personally had the duck and while it was cooked properly it was just a very tough piece of meat. I truly wanted to like this place, but being raised Italian I would call it Italian only by name. The bread was like Cracker Barrel biscuits and the olive oil was thin and unflavorful.  I'm not sure we would go back, perhaps only in a pinch.",

    "text": "AMAZING PASTA.  My mom says it's not as good as Italy but it is pretty dang close, and that's good enough for me.  PARKING: It's located in the Cosmo, third floor I believe at the corner near the restrooms, it's kind of small random entrance.  Free parking at all LV hotels and a quick walk from any of the hotels on the strip.  ATMOSPHERE: Dark, with a great view of the Bellagio water fountains.  Ask for a window seat if you're with a group of 2, if you have a bigger group you can still get pretty close but not right up to the window.  There were actually a lot of big groups that we saw and they have several private rooms for big parties like birthdays or celebrations, which I thought was cool.  FOOD: Had to get the spaghetti with tomato and basil.  It doesn't look like a lot in the pictures but when you  unravel the pasta, it's plenty for one person especially if you're going to be getting any appetizers or dessert.  BREAD BASKET - They give you all kinds of bread, sourdough, focaccia, stromboli (i think thats what its called with salami and cheese) and for those allergic to dairy, the foccacia is dairy free!!  CREAMY POLENTA - Sooo good, and I don't even like polenta!! It's creamy like mashed potatoes and so flavorful (prob a lot of butter) with the mushrooms it was perfect.  TUNA 'SUSCI' - Also VERY good, and very fresh! A tun roll but the tuna was wrapped around the outside, I dont remember what was inside but it was tasty.    SPAGHETTI - So amazing.  They hand make it everyday and you can tell.  It was al dente and CHEWY, fresh!! And the sauce was delicious, light but flavorful and something that seemed so simple but blew me away.  Also for those allergic to dairy they can make it without butter and milk and my sister said it tasted just as good.  I tried a piece and it was good, but definitely not as flavorful as mine.    AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE - Your basic rich, chocolate cake with a slight runny inside.  It was a great way to end the night but by the end of it I was  completely stuffed.  Overall, a great place to try if you're looking for a fancy place in Vegas.  The pasta is like $26 and the atmosphere, although not the best I've ever had, is good and romantic for a date or a fancy dinner with the family.  Just make sure you get a good window seat!",

Our host Bex was amazing and truly opened the door for us to experiencing the world of V.I.P.! The staff was very polite and helpful. Our private room was spectacular-we had an amazing view of the Belagio Fountain!  The executive sous chef came out to talk to us and gave us an intro on their specialties. I am the type of person who cannot make up their mind on what to order so the chef gave me some suggestions and there we began our round of unforgettable appetizers.   I definitely lived it up that night-felt so important and spoiled to have the staff wait on us the way they did. Small details like having the chair pulled out for you, the napkin laid across your lap, even the pretty bottles of water all added up.  The food, of course, was other worldly. Everything from the main course to the desserts were such a dream. I could not believe I was eating all the delicious food that I see hyped up so much on tv.   I notice a lot of small details and absolutely everything-even the atmosphere as well as the design of the restaurant was beautiful, unique, and classy. The whole experience at Scarpetta exceeded above and beyond in all areas. I have never been so pampered my whole life and I simply CANNOT and will NOT do Vegas any other way! I highly recommend!!!!!",

During our Vegas trip, hubs and I were looking for some great Italian and being that we were staying next door in Aria, we figured Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan would be a great fit. A 9:30 pm reservation and we were off!  As mentioned, this is a pretty romantico restaurant with dim lighting, slick tables and modern touches. Service was helpful but not intrusive - a definite plus!   And how about the dishes...  Heirloom tomato salad: 4/5: A very delicious combination of incredibly fresh stracciatella cheese, great tomatoes a bit of salsa verde and eggplant. The portion was small but it was bursting with flavor.  Spaghetti: 4/5: Yeah, seems boring but our server mentioned how great the fresh pasta, scratch made sauce and basil was, so I went for it. I'm glad I did because the pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were completely on point without being overwhelmingly tomato-y. Again, portions are very small here - even for the pasta. Perhaps a 1-1.5 cups of pasta for $24...that's pretty steep...albeit delicious.   Would I go back to Scarpetta? Absolutely. It's creative and delicious Italian fare in a gorgeous restaurant. Give it a try...and bring your credit card :)",

I was worried about eating the raw meat and was glad we shared it, otherwise I don't know if I could have finished it by myself. It was delicious. We also shared the main meal, prime rib with lardo mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. So yum and tender! I highly recommend it.  We shared the entire meal in order to make it to dessert only to find that the dessert there doesn't cut it. I mean it was okay, just not worth the price. I tried their Nutella & vanilla creme bombolini. It was okay. I hate saying this, cause I'm a nutella fan, but the nutella really brought the dessert down a notch. It didn't taste like a fine dining dessert. The banana bombolini tasted like banana pudding, so that wasn't good either. My husband tried the chocolate cake and he thought the presentation was lacking and the cake was only okay. Their esperesso was very strong, a good way to end the night. FYI the drinks are delicious and pleasantly strong. I tried the berry smash and my husband had a few billionaires, both were good. Overall: The food is super delicious, but skip the dessert.",

However, my prediction was soon proven wrong.  We arrived and were seated immediately in a comfy booth facing the windows. Our server quickly came to our table with bottled water and began to introduce himself and the restaurant to us. His delivery was smooth and made us feel welcome.  He took our wine orders, brought out the vino and listed off the specialties of the house for the evening. Soon after departing, a waiter came to our table and delivered the first batch of goodies. A basket of treats with artisan baked focaccia, bread with salami and oozing cheese baked right in and a selection of dipping sauces. We quickly devoured one of each and were in carb heaven.  When our waiter returned we put in our main course order of their famous spaghetti and the Short Rib agnolotti. He refilled our wine shortly thereafter and let us enjoy some conversation and spectating.  This place was buzzing at 10pm with eye candy and low-lit cool vibes.  Finally, our main courses arrived. The spaghetti is unforgettable with thick noodles, creamy reduced marinara and a touch of fresh basic. The short rib agnolotti, the little perfectly packaged pockets of braise short rib and hint of horseradish bursted with slow cooked flavor.  Overall, the staff, food and ambiance was something I won't soon forget next time I am in town.",

We decided on the octopus appetizer, which they very nicely split between two plates for me and my date so that we didn't have to do it on our own.  For an entree, I had the veal chop which came with potato mash, green peas and sweetbreads.  It was cooked to perfection and a large portion (you always worry about portion size at rather expensive restaurants, or at least I do--the last thing I want to do is leave hungry).  My date had the pork chop, which came with vegetables and an apple compote, which he said was very good.  And for dessert we had a coconut panna cotta that had grilled pineapple and a papaya \"soup\".  It was light and a perfect way to end the meal.  Jason was great and he had recommendations on wine pairings and helped us pick out the delish dessert.  We had a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains as well, so that was beautiful.  All in all, this was one of the best meals I've ever had, and would certainly love to return next time we are in Las Vegas--hopefully with a Chef Conant sighting next time too!",

    "text": "I love Scarpetta :)  The spaghetti there is delicious. I ran into Scott Conant at the South Beach Food & Wine Festival and he insisted I try out his restaurant. I'm glad I did. When I lived in Miami I frequented the Scarpetta in the Fontainebleau. The bars in the Miami Scarpetta v the Vegas Scarpetta are very similar. I like the layout of the Vegas Scarpetta better but the views of the two restaurants are the same. Miami overlooks the Fontainebleau pool area and water and Vegas overlooks the Bellagio fountains. The most recent visit to the Vegas Scarpetta was my favorite. One of the specials that night was a black truffle pasta. AMAZING. It was so delicious and filling, total comfort food. Granted it was a $60 (small, probably nutrionally not good for my figure) bowl of pasta but worth every penny (and bite).  Of course service was spot on and the house Riesling was great.",

    "text": "A new Vegas restaurant that's not ready for the big time yet. I find owners and management of restaurants that originate in NYC tend to run their restaurants the same way here in Vegas and in general the wrong way here on the west coast. Management is rude and thus rubs off on their employees. Service is slow and we found ourselves asking for everything water, drinks, desert menu etc....small portions and ridiculously high prices. Food was luke warm and unseasoned. chocolate cake for desert was good. This place has a long way to go. Stay away and eat at one of the other 100 great restaurants Vegas has to offer.",

    "text": "As bad as DOCG was is as good as Scarpetta was. I learned my lesson....don't be cheap. It is worth the extra money to eat here for sure. I went here with a friend as our first meal on her first trip to Vegas. When you enter, the restaurant looks tiny... like a long hallway, and then when you get to the end it opens into a large restaurant with a big window overlooking the Bellagio fountains .... so cool. I was worried that I would need to order a lot to get full and spend a ton of money.... not the case. We both ended up ordering the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and not only was it delicious but it was super filling. It was savory, had varying texture, and spiced perfectly... I loved every bite. That, in addition to their amazing bread basket (including 4 types of bread with some stuffed with cheese/meat/veg and 3 dips a whipped soft cheese spread, citrus olive oil, and eggplant), filled us up...awesome! We finished with the waiter recommended doughnut dessert.... I had one complaint about that dessert, either I missed it or they didn't tell us that one side of the plate was all nutella filled donuts and the other side was all vanilla... I thought the vanilla and nutella would be mixed...so when I was eating from one side and my friend was eating from the other side we were both confused where the other flavor was.... Anyway, the nutella donut with the banana gelato was awesome, the vanilla...not so much. That was a pretty minor problem. Our service was great and we each paid about 30$...not bad at all. Will be back for sure.",

We had a four course meal with the scallops, braised short ribs, yellowtail, foie gras ravioli, spaghetti, Mediterranean Orata, black cod, NY steak, and a bunch of desserts. Our custom wedding cake with vanilla and chocolate marble cake with peanut buttercream was the most amazing cake I have ever had in my life (our guests said the same thing). It was well worth the price, as our guests kept raving about the food and how it was the best meal they ever had. We look forward to returning on our one-year anniversary!",

    "text": "I was very excited to dine here  for my first night in Las Vegas. When we arrived, the hostess was quite snarky when we requested to move one table over from her suggested table. Although the service was friendly, not once were our waters refilled nor was the table cleaned before the arrival of our dessert which you come to expect when dining at a place like this.   For our appetizer, we split the spaghetti. Decent but from my own personal dining experiences, the spaghetti did not warrant the hype. For our entrees, the bf and I dined on the duck  and short rib ravioli. We seriously could have passed on these two dishes.  They were forgettable and only made us reminisce about similar versions of these dishes that we had in the past which were not only better but cheaper. For dessert we ordered the strawberry souffle. By the time the dish arrived  the gelato on top had already melted adding to the mush of butter and bread within the ramekin.   All in all the best part of the meal was the complimentary bread. While I will not return, I can see aspects of Scarpetta that some foodies may enjoy.",

As much as i love trying restaurants that they dont already have in LA (pretty new), id heard about Scarpetta when I was visiting NY so we decided to check it out.   I had the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli which ws delicious! a real winner! They were so flavorful that even John (notorious for his 5 minute meals)  was forced to eat slowwwly.  I also ordered the sea scallops- so juicy!  & the veal was alright, nothing to write home about.  I wish i had known to request the table with the views of the fountain! We were sitting by the wall, but that was ok.  I would definitely come back, this place is one of the better restaurants in lv at its price point.",

The service was ok, and our particular server wasn't that attentive but I guess it was a busy night.   On to the food we tried several dishes:   1. braised short ribs  2. tagliatelle  3. duck and foie gras ravioli  4. short rib agnolotti  They were all decent, the pasta was good and the sauces were fine. I think my favorite was the duck and foie gras ravioli but it was super rich so I didn't eat much of it. I wanted to try more things but I was so full. Overall, it was a decent place and a good choice for a group dinner, but not sure if I would go there again.",

    "text": "Came on a Wednesday evening, May 9, 2012.  Catching up on writing reviews, and I wish I could have forgotten about this terrible experience already.  Our party of 4 approached the hostess and politely asked for a table.  She looks up... no smile.  We're told the wait is about 15 minutes, and we reply it's not a problem, asking if it's ok to sit at one of the many empty seats/booths across the bar near the entrance.  She pauses before answering that it's ok (and only later do I sense that her response was a bit cold).  However, I'm still in high spirits from having arrived in Vegas that evening for extended weekend of friends and partying.  As we're led into the dining room, I marvel at the coziness.  The room is quite small, with what seemed like 3 rows of tables, with the window seats overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  It's more intimate than I expected, and I immediately filed the memory as a good place to bring a date.  We're led to a circular, chic booth that had, in hindsight, almost a diner-like feel to it... but it was an upscale setting, and was something I actually enjoyed so we could eat family style.  We had chosen to dine here because Arvin T had heard they had an amazing spaghetti.  But let's continue chronologically.  The bread basket came out, and it was amazing.  The stromboli was tasty, though I'm no expert, and we ended up asking them for a second basket.  The waiter was slow in bringing that second basket out, and I definitely felt like we committed a taboo... but that didn't stop us from reminding him to bring that out for us.  I'd go down a play-by-play for each of the items on the menu, but, to be honest, it wasn't very impressive.  I really hoped the food was so good that I could look past the mediocre service, which bordered on indifferent.  But, alas, it cannot be said.  I would still recommend this place to bring your date for a nice, intimate dinner.  The dim yellow lighting exuded a warmth that I only wished was completed by quality service I had come to expect from the Cosmo...  If service isn't important to you, esp in relation to money spent, then I would still suggest giving this place a go sometime.  However, I think of Vegas as a place to escape - a sanctuary away from the hustles of life.  Scarpetta let me down, and it was only the first punch in the stomach by Cosmo that night.",

The food, nothing too surprising- good enough a quality, on par with my expectations, but didn't exceed it. Again though, the restaurant itself was so peaceful and powerfully refined, and this was itself a good enough reason for us, because its hard to find peace in Vegas. Whats nice about the restaurants at Cosmopolitan is each has its own character. And so depending on your mood, you can dial in what you prefer.   If you stay at the hotel, everything is a breeze too coz their reservation line is all connected into your tv. Fancy.  The Cosmo has it up there with selection of good restaurants. You do have to pay for it, of course. Thats Cosmo. Its $$$, but they do it well.",

    "text": "Scarpetta has been on my list of restraurants to try for a long time.  I never got a chance when I used to live in NYC, so during my trip to Vegas, it was an obvious choice.  I was so excited!  We ordered the yellowtail carpaccio and the octopus to share. Although both were good, it lacked the wow factor I was expecting from a restaurant of this caliber. The pink salt on the yellowtail was a nice touch but was missing a lot of the acid I usually like with my fish. In other words it was quite bland. The octopus was nothing to write about. We opted not to get the famous spaghetti because another pasta dish caught my eye which in retrospect was probably a mistake. But, how can you turn down squid ink linguine with lobster? This dish was decent, not great. There was a lack of sauce altogether. The squid ink although pleasing to the eye, was too mild in flavor for my liking. For the main entree we got the black cod and the branzino. The cod was delicious. I loved the flaky buttery meat and the roasted tomatoes which gave this dish some Italian flair. The Branzino was overly rich and neither of my girlfriends finished the dish.   Maybe this place was too hyped up for me.  It was a huge let down. The ambiance was quite nice, dark and sexy. But we did not get a window table with a view of the fountains as I had requested. Probably wont be trying the one in NY",

From start to finish, from the service to the food to the view, there was nothing anyone at our table could say negatively about Scarpetta.  I had the Black Cod which is apparently becoming very chic now.  It was so light and buttery that I only wish I could have had more.  It almost melts in your mouth.    Going as a group was beneficial because we were able to try several of the pasta dishes and share.  I'm not sure the pastas are enough as an individual entree but probably too much for an individual appetizer...if that makes sense.  They are perfect for sharing.  We went with the short rip agnolotti, traditional spaghetti, and duck foie gras ravioli.  All were awesome, even the spaghetti which was a surprise to those at the table doubting a typical or plain type of pasta was worth a try.  I would also highly recommend the lamb, at least 3 people at our table got it so I was lucky enough to have a bite or two.  It was perfectly cook on every plate and was so tender it was definitely a star of the menu.",

I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. Scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! Thanks",

    "text": "This place is amazing.  Location isn't a huge factor to me.  As a local in Las Vegas, I avoid the strip when at all possible.  That being said, being sat at a window overlooking the Bellagio fountain show is a nice view to see (no matter how many times you have seen it.)  The server (Joe) was nice, funny, and informative.  He knew how to sell without selling.  First off, bread.  With a place called Scarpetta, you should expect great bread... which they have.  One of them has salami in it, and I was happy just eating that.  The bread came with olive oil, a tomato chutney-like sauce, and a pesto.  All were great, but the olive oil blew me away.  I enjoyed it so much, I bought a bottle.  Appetizers, I got the \"creamy polenta\" which turned out to be the creamiest polenta I have ever had.  It was served with mushrooms and was amazing.  My date had the roasted sea scallops.  The service size was a tad on the small size, but she seemed to enjoy it nonetheless.  Onto the Entrees.  I'm a Food Network addict, and saw Scarpetta while ago on \"Best thing I ever ate\" where they talked about the Spagetti with Tomatoes and Basil.  I had it, and it was good.  It wasn't the best pasta dish I have ever had, but a solid 8/10.  The pasta is fresh, and had a great texture to it.  The sauce was heavy on the basil (a good thing,) and there wasn't a ton of it weighing down the dish.  Next time I go, I'll try something different.  My date had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravoli.  She seemed to be very much enjoying it, and let me have a bite.  I then understood why Scott Conant is looked at as this great master of Italian cooking.  This dish was outstanding.  I might just get this next time I go.  Lastly came dessert.  I was informed there was no Tiramisu on the menu (my favorite Italian desert,) so we looked at the menu.  Our server recommended the Coconut Panna Cotta.  My date got that, and I got the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes.  The only downside to the meal, I would have to say is the Risotto Crepes.  It isn't that they were bad, it is just that they were more like Taquitos than crepes.  They were little rolled and fried pieces of batter with a sweet risotto in the middle of them.  For the amazing meal we had up to that point, it was a letdown.  My date's Panna Cotta, however, was fantastic.  It had that light and fresh taste that you want after eating a lot of pasta.  I will definitely be going back, I'll just get the Ravioli and Panna Cotta instead.",

And the pasta is really that good!  I strongly recommend it here.  Mario the GM came over to see how our meal was which shows how caring their team is.

So I made reservations here this weekend knowing that my friends would enjoy the ambiance and food. Was a success, they kept thanking me for bringing them.   This time I tried the Duck Foie Gras ravioli, it did not disappoint. I also recommend the mushroom polenta soup, very rich in flavor. The duck breast and veal chop which I had last time were amazing so I wanted to try other dishes. I shared food with some of my friends which is an excellent way to try multiple items, we don't mind, sharing is caring. The lamb my friend ordered medium was very good, although I would have ordered it medium rare it would of been better.   As far as the service goes, they we're very attentive to filling our waters and replacing our drinks. When we paid, I gave the waiter a coupon which they emailed me for 15% off the entire meal, no problem. One of the waiters also helped me put on my jacket, very courteous. Every detail counts!",

I have a theory about Vegas restaurants: they're all very hyped and expensive but tend to fall short on meeting expectations.  I was in Vegas for a convention so went in for dinner.  I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli and it was so salty I couldn't eat more than one.  It actually felt weird on my tongue because it was so salty.   I normally don't like to send things back but there was no way I could eat the dish.  They gladly took it back and apologized.  I ordered the spaghetti in its place and they brought it out quickly so that I wasn't left waiting for my food while everyone else was eating.  Everything that the others had were alright but definitely not memorable (I don't remember what they got).  The service was great and the food was ok but those two factors along with the ridiculous prices, I would probably never go back.",

    "text": "Dined with two others.  It is DARK.  Not romantic, just dark. Got a headache from everyone around us using their cell phones to see their menus, the food, anything!!  The bread was ok - nothing to rave about.  When my husband requested an additional slice of sourdough to have with his salad, the bread they brought was cold, like fridge cold.  For starters we had oysters, buratta salad and polenta. Hands down polenta wins, exceedingly rich so we split it three ways!   Other apps ok. Main dishes short rib agnolotti, spaghetti with meatballs and the tomato basil spaghetti. Short ribs were ok, meatballs good and the plain spaghetti meh - overwhelming tomato with not even a hint of basil. Deserts Amedei chocolate cake, Nutella & vanilla bomboloni and mascarpone cheesecake. Best course of the night - only the chocolate cake was disappointing. We had lovely wine from a B+ list and espresso to end.   Our reservation was at 6 and it was made clear to us that we would not be seated until 6 pm. Front desk staff could use a customer service skills session. At about 7 pm, I needed to visit the restroom.  The single stall restroom was horrible. Trash cans overflowing, floor littered with water, paper, etc.  Hard to believe it could get in that condition in an hour?!? We have visited Vegas every year at least once for the last 20+ years. Lots of dinners in those years - this wasn't the worst but certainly not the best.",

    "text": "Great experience here! My boyfriend and I only had one night in Vegas, and we wanted to go big for dinner. We chose Scarpetta, and were so glad we did! Our waiter was very knowledgable and helpful, and the service was great. The decor was gorgeous, and had great ambiance. I would say it was very romantic with the dim lighting and lots of dark hardwood. The view was also beautiful, and we could watch Bellagio water show while we ate.   Now onto the food...  First off, we were very impressed with the complimentary bread. One of them had spinach and smoked mozzarella baked into it! We started with the crispy fritto misto as an appetizer, which was great. It was delicious on it's own...no aioli needed! I had the Pici for my entree. Tasted really great, but there was quite a bit of spice to it. It had a chili pesto sauce, so I should have expected it. It had a good amount of lobster in it. My boyfriend had the Tagliatelle, and we both decided that was the winner. The creamy truffle zabaglione sauce was to die for! The fresh vegetables and pancetta mixed in made it not overly rich as well. The pastas are made fresh there, and we could definitely taste the quality! We each had a glass of a nice Pinot Noir to enjoy with our pastas.   It was a little pricy, but the quality is just so great and overall experience made it so worth it! There are so many great restaurants to try in Vegas, but I know I will be back to Scarpetta. Definitely one of my top dining experiences!",

    "text": "Oh my WOW. So very good. We came here with friends that have been to Scott's restaurants in New York and LA and loved them both. And our food was amazing! First off the bread they give is amazing. You get various traditional Italian breads including stromboli. The olive oil butter was fantastic with it. We then got the endive and apple salad and polenta. The salad was fresh and delicious but the polenta was heaven!! Even the mushrooms (I only tried the juice from them) was great. I could eat that polenta everyday. As for dinner, we tried various things but most of us tried the spaghetti. It was funny because my friends recommended it and I almost laughed with them recommending the most basic dish on the amazing menu but I listen. Glad I did- I now have dreams about the spaghetti. I actually asked to go back the next day and get it again but we didn't have time. I have now scoured the internet to get the recipe. Very very highly recommended. We also tried the Pici and Agnolotti. Both were to die for. The agnolotti was actually a huge hit at our table. It is heavy and rich but just melts in your mouth.   This place was great and the service was very good. Honestly not a bad thing to say about it. I live in So. Cal and am planning a trip to go back to his LA restaurant as soon as I can.",

They seated us by the window, so we could enjoy the Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes.   All of the food was fantastic, including the bread basket they bring out in the beginning. Our starters were the grilled octopus and beef carpaccio. The beef carpaccio definitely stole the show, and went great with the accompanying parmesan crisps. I got the foie gras duck ravioli, which was solid and full of flavor. My bf got the short rib agnolotti, and if I could do it over again I would have done the same. While my ravioli was good, the agnolotti was excellent. Either way, you can't go wrong with their fresh-made pastas.   Unfortunately we were too full to get more than a glass of wine or dessert (thanks to an all you can eat brunch buffet), but I'm sure the dessert and cocktails would have been great. If I am in NY or Las Vegas, I will definitely come back to Scarpetta!",

The first time I went I was unimpressed but then I wanted the give it a second chance and was still not very impressed. With all the amazing Italian restaurants in Vegas, you can do better.   I love old school Italian food and all the pizzaz from the other Italian restaurants on the strip. Scarpetta is modern and minimal but the decor is nothing special. If you don't visit Vegas often and have not been to many Italian restaurants here this place seems great. I will say that on a positive note, yes the view is nice but you can get a better view at most of the other restaurants especially in the Bellagio. The pasta is also really great and fresh but overall the restaurant just lacks something.",

    "text": "Fellow Food Network junkies don't even need to be told why I lobbied to get to this place. I only need say one name to explain anything: SCOTT CONANT.  His rep is for fine Italian dining, and after having been a fan of his for umpteen years, the time had finally come to see if there was substance behind the style.  The answer is YAAAASSS, baby, and in spades, deuces, clubs...however you want to put it!  The restaurant is appointed in blond and dark woods and beautiful, but the real selling point is the HUGE picture windows that open out to the Strip, but ESPECIALLY the Dancing Fountains across the street at the Bellagio.  When you make a reservation or walk-in, make sure you ask for THAT seating.  You won't regret it.  The menu's not WAR AND PEACE-sized, so it wasn't difficult to make choices.  We opened with the Creamy Polenta (an absolute bull's-eye for me) and the Diver Scallops and Foie Gras for Bear, (which he shared generously - not a seafood fan at all, but the foie gras was fatty, sumptuous and completely decadent.)  Now, if you follow him on the Food Network, everyone knows that he's the \"pasta guy\", so I expected it to be pretty much close to perfect, when I ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti and the Spaghetti.  And how were they? Let's just say I have no idea where the hell that Agnolotti has been all my life, but if I weren't married to Bear already, I might have had to look into the possibilities of pledging my undying love to a plate of pasta.  And the Spaghetti?  Fits RIGHT in with Scott's philosophy about what makes it perfect: not soggy and not toothsome, with the right 'mouth feel', as they say, and a terrific marinara to grace it with. Meanwhile, Bear kept on the seafood tip with the Branzino, and gushed that he hadn't had fish that delicate or deliciously prepared, since our experiences at our adopted \"second home\" in Baltimore's Little Italy, La Tavola.  Now, with Chef Conant's and this place's rep, and the food being FANTASTIC, you may ask why not a full five stars? Well, there is a reason, and it has to do with the service.   We were gifted with a $200 Cosmopolitan gift card, which is what prompted me to urge Bear to give this place a shot. We'd already been to other Cosmo eateries, and the experiences were fine, but we were looking for EXCEPTIONAL, which this almost was...until the bill came due.  Turns out, the waiter explained when he came back the first time, that he didn't know how to process the card, since the number on the back wasn't working - something like that.  Bear, getting understandably perturbed, asked him to try it again.  And again, he came back, very sheepish and apologetic, and said again that the card wasn't \"taking\".  Not sure how this whole thing was ultimately resolved - I do believed the manager had to get involved at some point - but this hitch at the end was a SNAFU that dampened the whole experience for us.  We will probably be back...but it may not be for a while.",

    "text": "We've walked by so many times and wanted to try this place out because of Chef Conant. In fact, last year, I asked my parents-in-law if they wanted to have dinner here but after looking at the prices, they decided against it, so we didn't.  A few weeks ago, I went back to Vegas with my husband so we decided to check this place out, finally. We didn't have reservations so we weren't sure what was going to happen, but we got a corner seat for two. There's a dining room with views of the water show that we can kind of see from our seats.   My husband wasn't that hungry because we made the mistake of eating at a buffet earlier, so we didn't get an appetizer. I did get some red wine and so didn't my husband. They served us bread to start and it wasn't just any bread bowl, it was freshly baked bread and they were all delicious! I could have just eaten the bread and be happy about it.   So we finally ordered and I got the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, it was topped with panko bread crumbs for a nice change of texture. I loved it. It was also very filling! I was really uncomfortable afterwards because of the buffet earlier. My husband got the gnocchis with foam, it didn't have flavor to the foam, just for presentation, I guess.   We didn't have room for dessert, but we'll come back and have it some time soon. It lost a star because we were seated in the corner there because we didn't have reservations, or so we were told. People who walked in and said they didn't have reservations were able to be seated in the dining room. Please be consistent about it. You can tell us \"the dining room is currently full, you can wait for it to open up or we can seat you now in the corner, which would you prefer?\" Instead, they just made the assumption and seated us. Took away from the experience a bit, I'll be honest.  I posted the photos on my instagram and Chef Scott Conant liked it!!! Then I posted a photo of him liking my photo and he LIKED THAT! yay!!! Very cool! He seems like a cool guy and to top it off, a really great restaurant.",

As for the food, be prepared for a sudden indecisiveness to overcome you. It's not easy to narrow it down by any means. As for us, I ordered the Black Cod while my husband opted for the Duck. We also ordered the Spaghetti to split since it was noted in many of the reviews. We both absolutely loved our mains and definitely had a low key food fight of sorts over the spaghetti. Definitely more than enough food, but not so much that you regret ordering one extra main to split. Do not skip the spaghetti, I guarantee you will regret it. If not for the way it is served (under the dome) but definitely for the simplicity, yet amazing flavor.  As for the finale or dessert, we opted for the Amedei Chocolate Cake. Completely phenomenal and a rich brownie, fudge-like indulgence. Remarkably not nearly as rich and heavy as you would think, which ultimately made it the perfect finish to our meal.   Scarpetta, we will be back. (Probably not soon enough in our books).",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant while I was waiting for seats to open up from other near restaurant in Cosmopolitan.  From the outside, the ambiance seemed pretty romantic and we thought we'd give it a try since we've been to the other restaurant.  As we were guided through the narrow hallway, we came up on this bigger and even more romantic side of the restaurant. There were big windows for the beautiful view and big and small tables for big groups or small.  Service was fantastic. It seemed that every workers had different role. Hostess seated us, manager-looking person greeted us and guided us through the menu, server brought bread and explained the ingredients in detail, and another server served us delicious food. Every one of them were so professional.  To match with everything above, the plates we ordered were exceptional. Sadly I live in LA and will have to wait for another trip to Vegas to try those again. We had Spiced Duck Breast and Tagliatelle. Duck was cooked just right. It was little crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside, it melted in my mouth. Tagliatelle pasta was so creamy and rich. I usually don't chew much when eating but this time, I made sure I didnt swallow the food too fast ;).  I would strongly recommend this place to everyone. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this place. This place really did worth every dollar I paid for.",

My group and I had read reviews prior and wanted to try the duck and foie gras ravioli after seeing so many pictures and positive opinions. Since 4 out of 5 of us ordered the ravioli, I assumed they cooked it in a big batch and maybe missed the seasoning step because each person though it tasted so bland. Thankfully our server took each dish off our bill, because nobody ate more than a few bites. I did get to try the spaghetti and that was really good. I'm kicking myself for not getting something different, but maybe I'll give this place another chance.",

Between two people, we ordered the duck / foie gras ravioli and the tomato basil pasta. The ravioli was delectable, and I ate my fair share even though I am not a huge fan of ravioli. The tomato basil pasta was good, but a bit disappointing given I expected to be a ton better than the one we make at home - it ended up being just ok. In fact, I think I might like my version of it better.   What I loved though was the bread basket! So many different breads and dips to try. Yum! Got me pretty pull before our main pasta dishes came out.  Also, I had made a res on open table, but came early and did \"walk in\" instead. The hostess was still nice enough to sign me in for open table (without me asking) so that I could get my points. Other places have been known to cancel the reservation. So I thought that was really nice, and left me with a great impression of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Disappointed...that's the best way to describe my experience at the much hyped Scarpetta, at the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Our group of four shared several appetizers, entrees and deserts, but none were memorable.  Portion sizes were very small, and way over priced.  Of the starters, the thimble of steak tartare was tasty, but was only served with three slivers of garlic toast, so one of us got short changed.  The oysters and polenta were mediocre at best.  Our entrees included the signature tomato and basil spaghetti, a short rib filled pasta, and a carbonara style squid ink pasta that was very bland.  None of the main dishes were served very hot, and cooled quickly as we transferred them to our plates.  The deserts were undoubtedly the best part of the meal. The lava style chocolate cake, and the sugar coated donuts were a hit.  The cheesecake had a sour aftertaste.  Service was excellent at Scarpetta, as we were attended to by a flurry of servers.  Unfortunately, good service is not enough to bring me back next time.  If you are in Vegas and want to try a new restaurant, go somewhere else, but stop by the Cosmopolitan to check out the hotel and enjoy a drink in one of the many beautiful lounges.",

    "text": "It is a clean trendy restaurant with good food, but it is a little pricey and I expected a little more after reading all of the reviews.  I would recommend going in with lower expectations and you will be happy.  Food The food was very good, but it was not the best pasta I have eaten.  That honor goes to Babbo in New York.  I would give Scarpetta an 8/10.  It was rather pricey so not a good bang for the buck restaurant.  Dinner for 2 was $150 with 1 glass of wine each.  So it was good, but not great. Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli.  This was the best dish of the night.  There were about 10 small raviolis and they were cooked just right.  They were tender and full of flavor.  9/10 Tomato & Basil Spaghetti.  It is a simple dish and the pasta is cooked al dente.  I would have preferred a little more tomato or basil flavors with the spaghetti, but it was good.  It looked small at first, but there was a good amount of pasta with the dish.  8/10. Colorado Lamb Loin.  The lamb was cooked medium rare and it was tender.  It was less gamey than other lambs and I think I wanted more flavor from the lamb itself.  6/10.  I expected more for $40. I had both the Rosso and the Rubrato red wines.  Both were excellent and they had a very through wine list.  9/10    Ambiance It is quite a scene in the Comsopolitan.  There were a lot of women hitting the club on the level above the restaurant.  The restaurant itself had a view overlooking the strip.  Unfortunately, not all of the tables have that view and our table did not.  I would recommend making sure you get a table with a view.  You should for the price.  The restaurant looked clean and modern, similar to the hotel itself.  The chairs and tables were a little strange.  The chairs were hard to move and the table seemed to slide when you pushed away from it in your chair.  10/10  Service The waiter was attentive and kept checking on us throughout dinner.  He knew the menu and was informed about the dishes.  9/10",

We even heard the chef shout out orders like hell's kitchen: One risotto, two spaghettis; we had a party of 9 for a birthday and they treated us like kings.  The waiter Titus was an amazing help and made the meal excellent.  The food that was prepared was spot on! I had the world-renowned plate of goodness known as the spaghetti, but let me tell you this is not your typical pasta dish.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the infusion of fresh tomato and basil all concentrated into the smooth pasta was a burst of flavor in my mouth.  For my appetizer i had the polenta that \"has been stewing in the kitchen prepared by grandma for three hours.\" It was amazing; the best polenta i have had topped off with a truffle sauce mixture with mushrooms.  For dessert, I recommend the panna cotta, like i say a great panna cotta's consistency should jiggle like a nice woman's bosom and this dish jiggled perfectly.  The melt in your mouth dessert with a hint of coconut was a perfect end to a grand evening.  GO here and try it over and over again because the spaghetti is addictive.",

Duck and Foi Gras Ravioli, Risotto w/ short rib and Short Rib and bone marrow angolotti all good to excellent. Nothing better than home made pasta. Polenta w/ truffled mushrooms might have been even better that the pasta dishes...must try! I had the Veal Loin and Pork Belly. The loin was a bit dry, but flavorful..the Pork Belly was spectacular.  Friends had steak and halibut, all were very happy. Wine list is amazing..tons of Italian wines...pricey! Found a good bottle for around $100.  Overall, pretty reasonably priced meal for Vegas.

He informed us that the chef had already thrown out the pasta water (despite being 30 minutes before close).  Our entrees arrived and only 1 was PASSABLE.  Pasta was undercooked and rubbery.  Wine selection was mediocre, especially if you're looking at getting a bottle for under 150 dollars. Terrible service, terrible food.  You should be ashamed",

He had great advice, and was very understanding of my gluten allergy (and I was thrilled that they had a separate gluten free menu). Every dish ordered was an 'oh wow you gotta taste this\" moment. My friends said the stromboli bread basket with the choice of marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata kicked off the night. Other standouts included the short rib agnolotti, polenta with mushroom ragout and the chocolate cake with almond gelato and salted caramel. Even the music was great. I had been hating being in Vegas- the riff-raff, over-designed spaces,  overpriced fussy but mediocre food, but this restaurant redeemed the trip. Note to the management- if you already have a gluten free menu why not put it on the website with the other menus?? I wish we had known about this place earlier.",

More accessible and less intimidating menu than some of the other top tier restaurants in Las Vegas, but the food and service is every bit as good.

I went with 3 friends for my birthday (sidenote: Las Vegas Restaurants don't really do anything special for your birthday, no free dessert, maybe a candle on the dessert you order).  We split an appetizer, ordered a bottle of wine, and all ordered one pasta.  The bread accompaniments are fantastic!  The Marscapone \"butter\",  citrus infused olive oil, and tomato tapenade are delicious.  Each pasta we had was spectacular.  Then we each ordered a dessert (the coconut panna cotta was the best, light and refreshing, and I'm usually a chocolate person when it comes to dessert).  We had an issue with the check (they presented us with a check, then when we gave our credit card to pay the amount changed, turns out they gave us the wrong check the 2nd time around, but they went back and corrected this promptly) but other than that service was flawless.  We each paid about $60 for a shared appetizer, wine, pasta, and dessert and it was the perfect amount of food (full but not stuffed).  I went to Vegas for a food extravaganza (including going to Sage, CarneVino and Joel Robuchon's) and I would go back to Scarpetta every night if I could do it again.  The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is modern and well-done.",

    "text": "Wow. This place is pretty expensive, but it is worth every penny.  The service was spot on. Everything you would expect where you'll spend about $100+ per person on dinner.  Portions are small (well actually portions are normal size, they just seem small compared to most other places that try to impress you with mediocre food by giving you a lot).   For starters we had scallops - very good, cooked perfectly.  Seared perfectly for a nice crunch, and tender on the inside. And we had the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms. Wow, the polenta was full of flavor, and the truffled mushrooms were amazing. One of the best things I have ever ate.  We also had a pasta course (cannot remember what it was called), but it was almost like a ravioli and was stuffed with a meat puree of chicken and veal. The texture was super creamy, like a pate. This pasta was amazing. We also had the duck and foie gras ravioli. Even more amazing than the previous pasta. Tender pasta, the sauce was perfect, and the duck and foie gras was in a perfect balance.  For our main course we had 2 orders of veal loins wrapped in pancetta and served with sweetbreads and roasted vegetables. Let's just say there was nothing left on my plate.  Next we had dessert.  Tiney doughnuts (zepolle) filled with nutella and served with cream anglaise. I was so full, but managed to eat every one. We also had the cheesecake. Which was very very good.  This place will not disappoint. But you will spend some money. Our bill was 300 after tip, an we did not have any alcohol. Add a bottle of wine and it would have been about a 400 meal.  But no regrets. I'd go back as often as I could afford to.",

We were seated next to the window so we got to watch the fountains the entire night (contrary to what you might expect I did not get bored watching them over and over again). We started with the polenta w/mushrooms because I love it, the yellowtail, which was delicious and super fresh, and the scallops which were awesome. My sister had the infamous spaghetti which she loved (and I did too). My dish was out of control - it is called the black macaroni and if I could eat it all the time I would. It is squid ink pasta (not macaroni) with lobster and BASIL BREAD CRUMBS. I cannot describe how perfect this dish is - or how obsessed I now am with basil bread crumbs. Truly amazing. We got the zeppole for dessert. *Love* - truly excellent and wonderful - I wasn't expecting this level of awesome. I need to go to the one in nyc now so I can have the trifecta.",

    "text": "I loved everything about Scarpetta, from the food to the great ambiance overlooking the Bellagio water show.  Scott Conant puts his own unique twists on Italian classics, starting with the bread basket accompanied creamy butter, sun dried tomatoes and citrus infused olive oil, which is a very nice touch. Let's not gloss over the bread basket like you would at most of your standard restaurants, this bread basket is special. Maybe one of my favorite parts of the meal was the stromboli bread, dipped in some olive oil and topped with the sun dried tomatoes, I could eat that all day.   Another highlight of this meal was the braised short rib risotto primi piatti, this was a flawless dish. My best description of this dish would be, homey and earthy. The risotto had perfect texture and the short ribs were melt in your mouth braised. Next we had the spaghetti tomato basil and the duck & foie gras ravioli. Both amazing pasta dishes in their own right.  The spaghetti tomato basil did not disappoint, the homemade pasta had just enough bite to it and the sauce was simple but deep in flavors. The tomato sauce had a buttery richness to it, with a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes, and some freshness from the basil. It's truly a perfect spaghetti.   Duck & foie gras ravioli is very eloquent and rich. Very deep in flavors and a smooth velvety texture to the foie gras filling. The marsala reduction rich and buttery smooth in it's own right and when combined with the raviolli gives a Mike Tyson KO punch of flavor.  I highly recommend Scarpetta. The prices are also reasonable when you consider the delicious free bread basket, which can be a meal in itself. A very delicious meal and romantic place take your significant other, what more could you ask for. Absolutely a 5 star restaurant.  As great as this meal was the one thing that stands out to me is the stromboli bread with the complimentary bread basket with olive oils and sun dried tomatoes.",

I called two weeks ahead to request a signed cookbook.  The manager confirmed he got me a book and confirmed our reservation.  We were greeted with a warm smile and prosecco in honor of our anniversary.  My husband and I did the tasting menu with wine pairings and the staff went out of their way to serve us exquisitely prepared food, as well as a few additional dishes in honor of our special evening.  The pasta was fresh, the product was amazing and the wine pairings complimented all of the dishes perfectly.  Our favorites were the spaghetti and the foie gras ravioli - TO DIE FOR.",

    "text": "Leftovers for lunch yesterday, basically pasta all mashed together in a tupperware bowl, nuked into a hot mess. Didn't have a fork, but ended up using 2 plastic knives as chopsticks to eat at my desk in front of my computer while I worked. First bite I had,  first thought was, \"OMG!!! This is the worse pasta I have ever eaten in my life!  I can't believe I'm eating this!\"  Then I proceeded to eat half of it, constantly thinking, \"WHY AM I EATING THIS!!?!?!\" before I finally throw the rest of the contents away in disgust.  Why write about this experience?  Because throughout that experience, I kept thinking of the best pasta I had ever eaten which was the spaghetti at Scarpetta.  The texture, consistency, taste, and bite of the pasta was AMAZING!  The sauce was awesome, had a little bit of a kick to it.  I have to admit I have had better sauce, just barely, but that's because I really like a lot of garlic in my sauce, but the combination of the sauce and the spaghetti was incredible.  The rest of the meal was very good, the tomatoes & burrata dish, short ribs, polenta with truffles and assorted mushrooms, black cod with roasted tomatoes and fennel, coconut pannacotta, and creme brule were all excellent, but that pasta kicked this restaurant up another notch.  If you make reservations, ask for a window seat since we had an amazing view of the water show at the Venetian.",

Every single morsel of food that passed our lips was a taste sensation.  We started out with the seared sea scallops, the chestnut soup and the beet salad.  Each was out of this world delicious!  Our entrees consisted of the black cod which was buttery and perfect, the Sicilian spiced duck breast which was tender and tasty and the duck and foie gras ravioli which was creamy and sensational.  We ended our dinner with two desserts and I would highly recommend the Coconut Panna Cotta Guava Soup with Carmelized Pineapple.  Double-yum!  Service was outstanding and although we did not have have a table with a view overlooking the Las Vegas Strip, we enjoyed our comfortable booth with room enough on the table for all the dishes we ordered.

When you first look at the entrance to Scarpetta all it looks like is a long narrow hallway from a distance, but it is so much more. The restaurant opens up to an \"L\" and overlooks the Bellagio fountains. It really is a breathtaking spot and the atmosphere is to die for. Besides visiting the pools view of the strip, this restaurant has to have the best view of the fountains. When i arrived at the restaurant it was very busy so we sat at the bar. The bar is a great room of lights, atmosphere, and helpful people. While staying there we had many custom cocktails (Scarpetta creations) that the bartenders made that were delicious. We also enjoyed the bread, which they said came for D.O.C.G., which was fabulous. The bread was homemade and there were several different types, all of them great flavors. We ate their spaghetti and their ravioli, both were excelt. The cost of the meal and drinks was around $100. It was a little more than i usually spend, but when you buys drinks it can become alot more. I thought for the spot it was at, the food quality, and the atmosphere the price was right on. I would highly recommend this place, and if you already had a meal and just relax there with some of their drinks.",

Lucky for me, he shared his scallops. It was so soft and tender. My octopus appetizer was also very yummy.   For my entree, I ordered the lamb Balognese.

We split their Market Salad (orange, toasted almond, watercress, fennel, pecorino, honey & white balsamic), and had the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli and John Dory (melted leeks, wild mushroom brodo, truffle).  Salad was wonderfully flavorful in an innovative way, and the ravioli was among the richest I've had.  All the food was very good.  As mentioned, everything is a la carte, with no sides, portions are on the nouvelle side, but they will keep excellent different types of bread including some baked with cheese breads, coming to fill you up.  The service is good, but not to the level of white gloved five stars (no crumber, crumbs are left on the table).  Prices are up there, but not excessive for the Vegas strip, or Cosmopolitan.  We sat by the window looking towards the Bellagio, but the restaurant, being only on the second floor, doesn't have that great of a view, still, in that most Vegas casino restaurants have no exterior view at all, at least their tables are positioned to look out at something.",

Scarpetta's most famous dish is the simplest - spaghetti. Their Spaghetti Tomato & Basil is second to none. Not to any other Italian restaurant, not to Mom's cooking, not to Prego sauces. Nothing. You can't create these flavors, or this amazing al dente, floury texture, at home. I get it every time!  In addition to pasta, Scarpetta also focuses on other traditional Italian dishes, from chicken to buffalo mozzarella to fresh vegetables and seafood.   They also have a great signature cocktail list.   With so many amazing restaurants in Miami and Vegas, I always feel guilty returning to Scarpetta - until my food arrives in front of me. When eating Scarpetta food, one only feels pure, unadulterated joy.",

All the pasta dishes we ordered were phenomenal. The spaghetti my all time favorite. It amazes me how something so simple can taste soooooo good. The sauce is to die for and the spaghetti cooked to perfection al dente.   Scarpetta is One of the very few ITALIAN restaurants where i would ever pay top $$$ for pasta dishes.  I am not the type to complain about paying $$$ to go out and eat, but as someone who grew up an lived in italy for 20 years i know what good pasta is.   You can find Amazing pasta everywhere and for 1/5 of the price but Scarpitta is one of those rare exceptions. There is something about their execution of the pasta dishes that put its to another level. I love Scarpetta, and of course Chef Scott Conant :)",

All of the dishes we ordered were delicious and the service was exceptional. Great restaurant for a romantic dinner with a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Oysters, Short Rib Agnolotti, Spaghetti and the  Mascarpone Cheesecake. I would say this dinner is in my top 5 favorite meals and we have eaten at several Michelin Star restaurants in the past 2 years. Everything about this restaurant was wonderful from the food to the service. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family.",

Service: Our server Mike did a fantastic job along with the rest of the crew. Very knowledgeable about the menu and helpful when it comes to making suggestions that spot on.   Food:  - Yellow Tail Crudo: This was amazing! Probably my favorite dish of the whole dinner! It is a little small on portion (about 4 pieces) so if you're like me and love hamachi, I'd get two orders if was going back - Buratta Salad: Very delicious and very fresh. Their burrata is fantastic.  - Tagliatelle: This was also really, really good. They do it with a lamb bolognese sauce. Between the sauce and the fresh pasta, my goodness that was delicious. - Short Rib Agnolotti: Amazing and perfectly executed. It's hard to find perfected agnolotti because it's such a simple dish but incredibly hard to execute perfectly. They do an amazing job! - souffle - I was skeptical about this one because they said it only takes 10 minutes to make and didn't need to be ordered till after dinner. But some how, someway, the pull it off and have a beautiful Souffle. Not eggy at all.   Ambiance: Very nice for an elegant dinner. I will say though the restaurant is much darker then what you see in the pictures on their website.",

I ordered dinner and then a server brings me my bread basket. Holy cow - had I known about this I likely would've just ordered an appetizer as my only course. It's basically a basket with 5 different types of bread to try. Then you get an assortment of spreads - marscapone butter, lemon olive oil and eggplant caponata. I only indulged in one piece of bread but tried all three spreads which were fabulous  As an appetizer I had a salad special which was grilled tomato, a cherry tomato and basil \"compote\" and a beautiful piece of buratta on top along with toasted Italian bread. Wow this was delicious and very filling. The buratta was so creamy and the basil/tomato was delicious with no heavy garlic as you might get in other \"Italian\" restaurants.  For my main, I had to have a pasta. Scott Conant is supposed to be known for his pasta and it is all fresh made in house here. I went with the homemade tagliatelle with lamb ragu. Wow it was absolutely delicious. It had a piece of smoked buratta on top which I mixed in and had melt into the pasta which added a little bit of creaminess to the rich meat sauce.   The prices here are a bit extreme. But that's pretty typical for a Vegas celebrity restaurant.",

And man o man did it live up to its hype! The hype being my memory of this dish, of course haha.   But seriously, get the spaghetti. And start with the tuna crudo. Both were superb. The only mistake I made was going to Sterling Brunch for lunch, and having the Scarpetta ressie at 6pm. Wasn't enough time to digest all the food and fully enjoy the carb overload.   I know, I know. The pasta dish looks \"boring\". And \"small\". But trust, it's not. I couldn't even finish half the spaghetti! The tuna crudo came with four pieces. They kindly split the dish into two plates, which was a nice touch. We each got our own pasta, and added the mushroom and creamed spinach for some veggie sides.   Honestly, I love Scarpetta. And I'll 100% be returning. Hopefully, sooner than later! 5 stars.",

Scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor of cosmo and offers a great view of the water show on the strip!   They have a changing menu and amazing bread basket that comes with each meal! The bread is so good, I actually found myself most excited for their assorted focaccia, ciabatta, and sourdoughs that are served with lemon olive oil, an eggplant dip, and marscarpone butter.   We had the: Risotto with summer truffles: 5/5 this dish was amazing!! We ordered this as an appetizer to share but after one bite I wished I had ordered one just for myself  Duck and foie gras ravioli: overly salty and didn't have as much foie as I had hoped Short rib agnolotti: 5/5 favorite pasta dish of the night! Tagliatelle with lamb bolognese and truffle burrata: 5/5 Black calamarata: 4/5 didn't have as much uni as we hoped for but still good  Overall, the food was great and service was amazing and I'll definitely be dreaming of that truffle risotto until our next trip to Vegas!",

But what I really enjoy about the restaurant is the different spaces for dining which give you completely different Vibes and therefore meals at the same place.   Sometimes I'll sit in a booth in the bar area... very private little alcoves, very romantic and cool. Those tables are available for walk ins.  Sometimes we'll sit in the main room and kind of be surrounded by a fun happening scene,  and sometimes you can sit at a two top by the window and just zone out on the fountains playing across the street at Bellagio.  It's a worthy destination restaurant and a fun night out.",

    "text": "Lovely! Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo hotel. I couldn't make any reservations so we walked in when they opened around 6pm and was sat immediately. It wasn't by the window but you can still look outside from their huge windows.  It's really dark and intimate. But I can see how it can get annoying if you're sat by a large group with just too much alcohol in their system. We experienced that a little but good thing they were moved a little further from us.  OMG, the BREAD BASKET is AMAZING! The spinach and cheese bread and the one with the ham was delish. We had a 2nd refill since you can really try all the different breads when you're in a party of 3.  We started off with the MEDITERRANEAN OCTOPUS. It was good but I like my octo with a bit of acid or spice and it lacked both.  I think their pastas are their star dish here. We had the PICI (lobster meat one) and the SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI. And both were amazing! The agnolotti is a bit boring as a main dish though.  We were contemplating with the FILET OF BEEF and FENNEL DUSTED BLACK COD and decided to go with the cod. We had prime rib the night before so we wanted to stick with more of a seafood assortment. But dang, we got that one wrong! It was fishy in a not so good way and the skin was not even crispy but very soggy and unappetizing. Let me just say it was the least favorite dish.  We were sat by the wine fridge (it's really a whole wall across the center of the restaurant). Everytime they open it, it gets kinda chilly. There was a time when a guy was literally opening every door b/c he wasn't able to find the bottle. That annoyed me a little. The SOM was able to find it in 1 try. What an expert!

    "text": "Having dined at not only every Scarpetta in the country, but this one dozens (if not hundreds) of times, I was so excited when my husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in Las Vegas so I could enjoy another perfect meal at Scarpetta.   I am SUPER lame when it comes to my meals - I have ordered the same thing since my first ever visit, and was really excited when our amazing server, Roberto, informed me they had gluten free meatballs I could add to my tomato basil pasta.  I ordered that with the scallops, with my husband ordering the beef carpaccio and the osso bucco.   My scallops came, absolutely stunning, and each bite was more delicious than the previous. My husband inhaled his beef carpaccio, thrilled with his choice.   When the main courses came, I didn't even have a chance to take a bite when a kitchen staff member swooped in to take my plate.  I was confused, but then our server came back to inform us the chef wasn't sure if the meatballs he made that morning were gluten free or not, so they were going to remake both my meal and my husbands so they came out at the same time.  I was beyond impressed by this- they could have left my meal and wouldn't have known if I had gotten sick, or taken chances that it was fine and maybe I wouldn't have gotten sick. Who knows.  I, however, am extremely grateful that they did not take chances with me getting very very sick on vacation, especially while I was celebrating my anniversary!    Our new dinners arrived and were DELICIOUS.  Everything I could have hoped for and more.  Roberto wanted to do something special and asked if he could tempt us with dessert- we said we would look at the menu and instead, he came back with a delightful dessert champagne and three stunningly beautiful and HOLY DELICIOUS desserts.  The chocolate souffle, the molten cake and the caramel boudini. Oh. Wow.  First of all, I now need to order all three every trip and we did not leave a single bite.  These were so delicious. My mouth is watering thinking about them.... I wish they could deliver to DC!!!  This was yet another amazing dinner at Scarpetta, but the service and attention to detail cemented why this is my favorite restaurant in the world. They truly tried to make our anniversary special and made this night one I will never forget.  I cannot wait to come back and will most certainly request Roberto every time I am.",

I wasn't able to write a review last time but I am not and I literally have nothing to change if I wrote a review 6 months ago!  Clean place, great intimate setting, friendly workers, amaaaazing food, super cute date spot!  I called in ahead of time to make reservations and we were seated quickly as soon as we arrived! When I called in I asked for a window seat if available and we were celebrating an event and thankfully when we arrived we got Amazing seats overlooking the Bellagio fountains! We were given a basket full of a variety of breads and spread. We ordered Polenta, Short rib agnolotti, the standard spaghetti, sea salt carmel boudini. Honestly I stuffed myself SO much with the bread I totally shouldn't of ordered the spaghetti and really didn't even make it through 4 bites of it and ended up taking it for leftovers which tasted even more amazing the next day! The polenta is a MUST try here! It's a heavy cream base with mushrooms and just tasted soooo creamy and delicious! I wish they sold this by a bigger bowl instead of a small appetizer like bowl! The pasta was FRESH and the noodles are thicker than the average Spaghetti you'd make at home! They were great vegetarian options; they even have their own vegetarian menu!  I was also told the Agnolotti was perfectly seasoned, textured and delicious!  For dessert we ordered the sea salt pretzel toffee and holy moly it was heaven in my mouth! It was SO sweet and carmely so if you don't have a super sweet tooth, I've stay away from this one. It was perfectly sweet and salty and the pudding like texture was AMAZING! The prices are high but I'd say it's a fancy restaurant, the quality is great so it's worth it  I already can't wait to come back here!",

    "text": "The food was excellent. To start, we had the creamy polenta, which was delicious (we split it in half). On top of that, they have complimentary bread which is outstanding, all different types of bread. For our main course, i had the tagliatelle (lamb bolognese) and my boyfriend had the short rib agnolotti. I enjoyed my dish, but my boyfriends short rib dish was okay (maybe a bit too chewy - but we aren't agnolotti connoisseurs lol). And for dessert we had the mascarpone cheesecake and the chocolate cake. Omg both were soooooo good. That was probably our favorite part of our dinner.   If you're coming here for a nice date - call ahead for a reservation and see if you can a table with a view.",

    "text": "Ah Scarpetta. Restaurant of my all-time favorite judge on Chopped-Scott Conant, every episode I ever watched featuring Scott added a grain of sand on top of the ever growing mountain that was my dream of dining at Scarpetta. By the time I finally walked through those doors it was an Mount Kilimanjaro sized monstrosity of a dream. I was so giddy I took a picture with the frickin sign. I mean this was it! I was going to eat pasta the way it HAS to be sauced up and cooked, I was about to have a symphony of flavors dancing their way onto my modest palette opening my eyes to a culinary world that which I have never experienced in my 24 years. I was about to be blown away.   We're seated by the window with a nice view of the Bellagio water show. Oh things were going as I expected at this point.   Our server was nice, in a very proper, sophisticated, would not smile more than a 3/4 grin, and maintained an impressive monotone demeanor kind of way that which you expect at such a dining establishment. Everything is going according to plan.   We order the short rib risotto appetizer to share and I decide to get the roasted chicken as my entree while my partner in crime got the so raved upon spaghetti. As we waited for our entree the bread basket came out. There was a variety of different breads some stuffed with salami and cheese, and others with spinach and garlic all served with olive oil, cheese spread, and olive tapenade.   Holy crap. I ate this bread and thought oh my god this is it, this is what I've been missing. The flavor was bright and salty, the outside was crusty and chewy but the inside was tender and soft. Dip that into the olive oil and you're in heaven. I'm literally on cloud 9 at this point....  Out comes the short rib risotto that they kindly split into two plates.   First impression: Are we minions? I mean I know it's \"gourmet\", and I know we split it. But I kid you not when I tell you my portion was probably 2 tablespoons. IT'S OKAY THOUGH we're at SCARPETTA. I took a bite. The piece of short rib was juicy, soft, and boldly flavored. I liked it. The risotto was pretty good-the vegetables still had a nice crunch and it was a nice little bed for the short rib to sit on. Not blow my mind amazing, but good! Pretty good!  Okay the entrees! We get our hot plates and gracefully decide to not mention the fact that both of our dishes combined could probably hide behind an IPhone 6 Plus. We couldn't risk ruining the moment. But after taking a bite of my Japanese raised chicken that had eaten nothing but the finest grains before being swiftly beheaded, and brined in an anise spiced mixture for days before arriving at my disposal....I realized something. It didn't taste good. In fact it didn't taste like anything. I could hear Scott ripping a contestant to shreds for making chicken thats dry and needs a sauce, vegetables that have no love, and an overall dish with nothing bringing it all together. How could this be the cooking of the man whose every critique I felt I could so passionately agree?   After I had a bite of the spaghetti was when the depression truly set in. Not only was I excited to try this dish because of Scott's particular distaste for a mediocre bowl of pasta, but Ted Allen also picked the dish as the best thing he ever ate on Food Network's show as well. This dish had so much going for it.   Verdict? So painstakingly ordinary. The sauce had nothing really special about it-it was a bland, under seasoned tomato sauce, and for being homemade the pasta didn't really have that chewy bite you'd expect. Oh let me also add that it was a 9 bite portion (we counted).   Needless to say we decided to skip dessert, and I the girl who pranced in Scarpetta walked out like a little girl whose mom lost her bunny rabbit because she wanted her to \"play\" outside. Oh wait...that was me too.   Scarpetta, you disappointed me-and for that I nominate Scott to the chopping block. I think I'll stick with Alex Guarnaschelli's opinions for now.",

Everything came out timely and he made sure our glasses were full. After dinner, they brought out a desert plate that had \"congratulations\" written on it. Above and beyond!

    "text": "I went here on a very specific mission: duck & foie gras ravioli. I barely even glanced at the menu - all I needed was confirmation that the ravioli was still there. And while it took awhile to get to the point where I got to finally eat the ravioli, it did not disappoint (an oh-so-divine 5 stars).  When we arrived, we were promptly seated. However, we were actually seated more in the bar area than the actual restaurant area (which appeared to have a decent view). Where we were seated was ok, though. It was a curved booth that had a very private feel to it. But it was near impossible to take in and experience the ambiance where seated.  Our server was nice and knowledgeable. I stated what I planned on eating and he was able to recommend a glass of wine to pair with it. However, when our food arrived, there was no ravioli. I had been delivered some other duck dish instead. Having to send it back and sit there while the others I was with completely finished their meals was quite awkward. And while the server who actually delivered the food apologized, our main server, who took our order, said nothing.   The whole mix-up experience seemed very un-Vegas. No apologies, no \"dessert is on us\", no nothing. I honestly felt treated like I was the one who screwed up (despite being very clear on what I wanted - and it was my sole purpose in dining here - and having witnesses who can vouch to what I ordered).  So despite the ravioli being a home run, I have to deduct stars for the rest of the experience.   But OMG the ravioli is beyond fantastic. I literally sat there and considered ordering a 2nd helping. Move over Mario Batali - your beef cheek ravioli now has some serious competition. In fact, the duck & foie gras ravioli at Scarpetta may actually be better than B&B's beef cheek ravioli. I'm going to have to that 2nd helping in order to confirm, but I may indeed have a new favorite Vegas dish.  So yeah, fab food, but not-so-hot first dining experience.",

The three stars are given more for the ambience then the food. Our table looked out to the Bellagio and we were able to watch the fountain show as we dined.   Great disappointment fell over me as I began to eat the Farmer's Market Salad. Beautiful yes, full of wonder fresh veggies BUT unless you got a mouthful of pecorino in every bite it was severely under seasoned.   We both ordered pasta dishes. My bf the duck foie gras ravioli and I the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pasta itself was light and delicious. The Marsala reduction on the duck foie gras was a little powerful over the duck flavor but overall a good dish. However, the horseradish flavor in the agnolotti was so overpowering it left my palette craving to be cleansed after each mouthful.     I'm glad I tried Scarpetta but based on this visit not sure I would be willing to give it another opportunity to disappoint.",

While in Vegas for the weekend, we thought we would try out Scarpetta for our \"fancy dancy meal\".  Two of us ordered the famous Spaghetti, Mr, Buxton ordered the Foie Gras Ravioli, and Mr. Bloewen ordered the Linguini.    The Spaghetti had a lot of hype, but I can clearly say it was the best Spaghetti that I have ever had.  Was it worth ~$28?  Probably not.  The Foie Gras Ravioli, on the other hand, was something unique, and as Larry David would say, Prettay Prettay Prettay Prettay Good.  As Mr. Buxton was eating it, he just kept saying, \"Wow. This is unreal.\"  He had to constantly put his fork down as he was enjoying the dish so much.  I was also lucky enough to try the Linguini dish.  It was also very very good.  Great flavors and cooked to perfection.  The only problem was the Mr. Bloewen had a bit too much to drink prior to dinner, and was not able to finish the meal (basically committing a crime). The rest of us got too full to help him out, but it should be no knock to the dish.  We also enjoyed a couple $16 dirty martinis (clearly overpriced), and had an overall great dinner.  Why 4 stars and not 5, you ask? Well, I felt as though service was a bit snooty, and the spaghetti was good, but clearly overpriced.  I was not sure why our waiter was looking down at us, and not very friendly.  If it was not for that, Scarpetta would have clearly gotten 5 stars, as it did meet my high expectations.  Next time my wife and I want a nice night out, Scarpetta would be a good choice.",

Scarpetta fell on the night we celebrated my birthday, and I am so glad!   The restaurant looks great and the service is perfect. The waiters are all extremely knowledgeable and can answer pretty much anything.   But who cares about that? The food... it was ridiculous! To begin with they bring out some bread, as with most restaurants, but Scarpetta bread is next level! There were some regular rolls which were bomb. But there was this one type, no clue what it was called...but it had some kind of meat inside! I thought the waiter mentioned that to us, but I figured I was hallucinating. Nope! It was phenomenal. The bread also came with butter and other accoutrement. All delicious!  So I could have left happy at this point. But my food slayed me. I think I may have actually died, said what up to a couple of angels, and then rejoined my table after frolicking on a cloud or two. I ordered the Black Fettuccine (pasta dyed with squid ink, adorned with king crab, squid, shrimp, and breadcrumbs while bathing in lobster broth). Need I say more? It tasted better than it sounds. It was more than worth the $42 it cost.   I also tried my friends' flank steak (amazing) and black cod (also amazing). But lets be real...I won.  As a dessert we shared:  Bombolone - Basically an italian doughnut. There were five. Two filled with nutella and three filled with something white that by some ungodly magic was BETTER than nutella! Never thought I'd say that. It also came with banana gelato which just pushed my taste buds past their limits of joy.  Amadei Chocolate Cake: The richest most delicious chocolate cake you'll ever have. The inside was filled with molten chocolate goodness. It also came with toasted almond gelato. Also heavenly.  I implore you to try this restaurant when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Surprised my boyfriend with dinner here this past Saturday for his birthday. We made reservations for 7:30 and requested a table by the window. We were 5 minutes late because we had to stop by the ATM which, by the way, is located right at the foot of the escalator by security. We were greeted by the hostesses and manager who were all friendly. The dining room itself was a lot smaller than I had expected. They were able to accommodate our request and we were seated at a beautiful 2 top with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. Water glasses were immediately filled and a bread basket magically appeared with 3 accompaniments: citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and my fav, mascarpone cheese... way better than boring butter! Like everyone has already mentioned the bread basket was delish! We also got a bottle of red wine for a great price, $75. We shared everything and for some of the dishes they were actually able to split it in 2 so it would be easier to share! This was my first time tasting fresh pasta and you can most certainly taste a difference. There's a specific bite and texture that can't be compared to that dry stuff at the grocery...   -Raw Yellow tail: 4 very fresh pieces!!! Love the salt sprinkled on it. And the pieces were actually pretty thick and not some skimpy thin little things. -Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms: Perfect balance of creamy and sweet. I liked it because it was more like a soup for me haha -Braised Short ribs with Risotto: tender chunks of beef. Tasted like this Korean short rib dish that I love.  -Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: My favorite dish of the night. It was so decadent and delicious. If you don't like the taste of strong cheese, you will not like this dish. The sweet Marsala sauce paired perfect with it. -Spaghetti: I'm sure some people have a problem spending $25 on a small plate of spaghetti but it definitely is something everyone should taste at least once. Light, fresh sauce with perfectly aldente pasta... It is because of this dish alone my boyfriend had been wanting to come to Scarpetta. He has made this recipe a couple times for me and I'm sorry to say but my boyfriend's spaghetti tastes exactly the same.. if not better. But then again my opinion may be biased HAHA -NY Strip Steak: It was a mistake ordering this because we were so full. We had to force ourselves to finish this dish HAHA At $55 though I didn't think the steak was THAT amazing.. It actually had some unwanted gristle on it. But I'm sure it would have tasted a lot better had we not been SO full.   I really wanted to get dessert for him and they were going to do something special for us but we were already so late for our show and not to mention so beyond STUFFED.. We had to run out of there... literally, we ran out of there!   Service was amazing all night from our server all the way down to the lady who came around with parmesan cheese and chili flakes. But special shout-out to Paul K...the friendly food runner/expo who was so polite and quite knowledgeable about all of the food.   THANKS SCARPETTA!  SCOTT CONANT, YOU ARE HOT  ;ppp",

We were seated in the larger dining room with an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains show - did not realize the fountains could shoot that high into the air?!?! Wow!  Ambiance was nice, relaxed, easy. Selection  on the menu was great, something for just about everyone. Wait staff gave us 5 star service. Value was a 3 because although the meal was decent, we had read so many excellent reviews and this restaurant came highly recommended by peers from work, yet the food didn't blow us away. We ate recently in Napa at Bottega and paid the same amount ~ $125 for the meal and neither of us could stop talking about that meal. At Scarpetta, the $125 was expensive for the food. We shared the Burrata salad, which was delicious. - I recommend it. I had the turkey dinner special (a Thanksgiving special item) it was good, but the taste was average. She had the lamb and we thought the turkey was better. No dessert.   Wine selection was excellent. I'd recommend the restaurant but wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.",

Upon arriving at the time of our reservation we were told the table was getting prepared. So we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting for 15 mins and when they finally walked us back to our table the restaurant was not as packed as I had expected. Strange that it took that long to just get us seated. We started with the diver scallops YUM! And then both ended up getting pasta. We got the lamb bolognese and the Pici lobster pasta. Both were delicious! I preferred the bolognese, amazing burrata on top and plenty of meat and pasta. The lobster pasta was different but not bad at all! Our server barely checked on us and was much more interested in other tables (tables buying expensive wine, etc.) I understand giving maybe a little more attention, but at least come and check on us! I would come back because the good was that good, but maybe just sitting in the bar next time. They have nice intimate booths that would have been perfect!",

We ended up ordering the polenta with mushrooms as an appetizer. The polenta was creamy and the truffled mushrooms added great flavor and some texture. Then we ordered our main dishes. My dad ordered the black cod and he said he loved the dish. I ordered the veal shank and thought it was a great dish. It was cooked medium and tasted delicious. I wish there was more sauce on the veal rather than just the juices, but it was great. We also split the short rib pasta, which was decent. The pasta was fresh and made in house, which is always good. And the short rib was tasty, but after a few bites, the pasta kind of seemed redundant and too hefty. Following the main course, we ordered two desserts. We ordered the mini donuts with Nutella which were sweet and a bit of a mess. Then we had the gluten free, dairy free, chocolate ice cream parfait. It was extremely delicate, yet delicious. Overall, our experience was great and our waiter truly helped us choose some great dishes. I would come here again, next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

I'm happy to say that someone else picked up the tab for my visit and encouraged me to order whatever I wanted, so I did.  The service is what you'd expect from a restaurant like this - the entire staff is attentive, polite and knowledgeable.  I had some questions about a few of the dishes and my server didn't give me the old, \"hang on, let me check\" or the bald faced lie.    I started with the creamy polenta mostly because I've never had creamy polenta before. It was good. Not what I expected, but it was quite tasty. An excellent starter.  Since I wasn't paying, I ordered the veal chop which comes with a side of spaghetti, squash, and mushrooms.  Cooked perfectly and it was delicious.  Although I was full my host had ordered a banana souffle and I hated to see it go to waste.  Wow - just Wow.  Excellent food and service in a beautifully appointed restaurant.  No, it wasn't cheap but it was well worth the price. Note - they also have a gluten free and vegetarian menus.",

After ordering our bottle with him we were offered a taste of champagne, but after out first course came and went he hadnt returned with our bottle so we complain to the server. She comes by with a glass of champagne as a peace offering while she tracks the somm down. Our main course is half eaten and he walks over with the bottle half open and apologizes for forgetting us. He didn't ask us if we still wanted it, especially considering that dinner was 15 mins from being done, he just opened it.  We get the bill and the bottle's not on it so we thought that was a nice gesture for makes us having to wait all dinner. He comes back and says he forgot to put the bottle on the bill and rang our cards with the corrected bill... I'm like wtf is wrong w you. He drops the check with someone else's card and bill. We have to send it back.   I know it's just two ladies so our bill was only $200 but still... Wtf is wrong with you. Nice service should come no matter how high roller your table is. He was terrible.

We ordered the truffled polenta, which was rich and full of umami flavor.  -fritto misto was tasty, has shrimp and squid in it as well as veggies and lemon -arancini were crisp and flavorful -short rib agnolotti had good amounts of beef in there so you could really taste it, but they were a bit oily  A big treat was complimentary house-made potato chips that were still warm. You get a big bowl of them!   It's a nice way to be able to sample several dishes from the regular dinner menu, and service was excellent.",

LOVED that they gave white napkins for white dresses and black napkins for dark dresses.  the ladies can attest to the lint nightmare.    boo!: ask for a view! i failed to so we didn't have the bellagio view. (for next time).  bread: insert triple toe curl for the bread selection and i'm not a gluten freak.  i would make out with the pastry chef just for the bread alone.  appetizers and entrees: - the bride to be was in bliss with her veal duo. - i loved my foie gras pasta - it was not salty like other yelpers have mentioned. and i'm sodium sensitive. - every gal pretty much loved their dish from short rib to lobster pasta. - the only mini ding was that the calamari was way too spicy for my liking.  wine list is lovely and affordable for vegas.    we would have stayed longer for more foodie adventures but our  group had more stops to make that night.  scarpetta is a solid date night spot or whenever you want to be pampered.  tip: the lighting is kind on the eyes.  no botox required.",

Chocolate cake with gelato and Carmel sauce. Out of this world. My husband enjoyed dessert as well which looked like doughnuts filled with Nutella. The food was so delicious we wanted to come back, however they close down for 10 days prior to the holiday season. Our waiter was so kind as to give us a tour of the restaurant dining room that overlooked the Bellagio fountains. They also have 2 private rooms. One for events and another that is the chefs table. We got a tour of the kitchen which is impressive and impeccable. The exterior doesn't do the size of the restaurant justice. It's full scale and top notch. Our waiter recommended the pasta for next time, since we already had eaten prior to our visit. Due to their Holiday closing, we took his advice and tried the DOCG next door which was amazing. Next time we find ourselves in Vegas we will definitely eat here and if possible reserve the chefs table.",

We had the tasting menu:   - Duo of Yellowtail and Tuna \"Susci\": melt in your mouth delicious!  - Roasted Sea Scallops, Cauliflower, Bottarga, Chili and Caper Salmoriglio: Sea scallops can be rubbery and chewy if not cooked properly, but at Scarpetta, they were cooked to perfection. They had the consistency of flaky, firm fish and the roasted cauliflower was a perfect pairing.  - Spagetti Tomato Basil - simple and good, but not memorable.  - Black Cod, Caramelized Fennel & Concentrated Tomatoes - The fish was nice and flakey and the tomatoes added a nice acidity to the fish. I'm not a fan of fennel as they are too \"licorice-y\" in flavor for my taste.  - Spiced Duck Breast, Endive, Preserved Orange and Cippollini - DELICIOUS! I love duck, but I hate when its not cooked properly or tastes overly fatty. This was a perfect balance. The preserved orange cut through the richness of the duck. Yum!  - Amedei Chocolate Cake & Toasted Almond Gelato - Toasted almond gelato & salted caramel sauce. SELF EXPLANATORY....IT WAS HEAVEN!  What made this experience special was that the chef brought out a few mini appetizers with every dish served, so it was like having an \"extended\" tasting menu. He brought out:  - CRISPY FRITTO MISTO - seafood, vegetables, artichokes, herbs & lemon - CREAMY POLENTA - fricassee of truffled mushrooms: By far my favorite dish at Scarpetta. Upon first glance, it looks like it would be too heavy and rich, but it was AMAZING! - SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI - brown butter horseradish & toasted breadcrumb. - ZEPPOLE - nutella center, vanilla sauce and candied hazelnuts. Need I say more?  I loved the ambiance and service of this restaurant. We were seated by the window facing the fountains of Bellagio. A beautiful place to take someone on a date!",

Their selection of freshly baked breads was delicious and included focaccia and other assorted Italian breads. Since this was our first time dining here, we played it pretty safe with our selections. We shared the roasted beat salad, burrata, duck & foie gras ravioli, and sirloin. For dessert: we shared an italian version of a beignet the name of which I can't remember.

But after ordering the short rib risotto and seafood pasta dish, I was beyond stuffed.  I would have been completely satisfied with ordering just the seafood pasta.  Talk about overselling, but I don't think he meant to do that...who knows!  It's expensive, but Vegas in general is expensive.  If you're looking for a great meal but don't mind spending the $$$ then you should check this place out.  While their menu isn't extremely extensive I think it has a little something for everyone.",

    "text": "I'm a huge Scott Conant fan. His food is my food, yo.   Went back last weekend and the boyf and I went full throttle. 3 pastas! That's how we roll!   I've never had an entree here, I could leave most of the appetizers (except for a ridiculously awesome gazpacho), but the pasta is SICK.   Ratings: #1 Spaghetti with tomato sauce:  OK- how does he do it? It's some pasta, it's some tomato sauce. Why is this heaven? It's tart, rich, chewy- this could be a whole meal. I've scoured the interwebs and come up with a pretty good approximation of his sauce (hint, infused olive oil, fast cooking times, butter, fresh basil, and grated parmigiano play a big role). But that pasta, how is it fresh and al dente all at once? The waiters are all coy minxes about this one.   #2 Foie Gras ravioli: Very rich, cloying in a good way: super umami and flavor town. This doesn't skimp on the foie. We love it.   #3 Stracci- Leek and shellfish rough cut pasta. Subtle and awesome, the pasta is again the star of the show. It's silky and coated in a wonderful leek sauce. I'm a salt nut and thought this could have been more heavily seasoned.   #4 Truffle tagliarelle- Special last weekend. We had to try it. This was almost too subtle. It was almost refreshing, which you wouldn't expect from a cream and truffle based sauce.   #5 Lobster Black Farfalle- Actually, the truffle and the lobster were at around the same level for me. This was again very subtle, deliciously textured pasta, the lobster was happy, but not the star.   It's all great here, but if you don't get the spaghetti with pasta sauce, you're doing yourself a disservice.   Atmosphere is fine, if you can, request a table close to the window to view the Bellagio water show.   Waitstaff is generally good. The sommelier really upsells his wine, especially the expensive stuff, which is lame (I bet he'll tell you to try some Peter Michael stuff which is like 3x+ the retail here). But on the plus side, the wine he's chosen is truly good. We had an insanely awesome white burgundy and I have to stop this review right now to go look up the name.",

I made a reservation at Scarpetta for Valentine's Day based on great reviews, a great Chef running the place, and the fact it wasn't overly pricey.  I am so glad I choose this gem!  The restaurant decor is so lovely and romantic.  We were sat next to the window overlooking the Belagio fountains... how perfect!  My Husband's view was somewhat blocked, but we really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The food is great.  We absolutely LOVED the bread basket with dipping sauces.  Each was great in their own way, but the butter and eggplant was awesome.  The stromboli (included in the bread basket) was literally to die for.  We shared the short rib appetizer, which was small, but tasty.  This was our least favorite thing we ate, but it was still really good.  For our entree we shared the duck and foie gras ravioli.... it took my breath away!  It was so rich and delicious- I will be thinking about this one for awhile.  For dessert we had the zeppolis, which were a great way to end a fabulous meal.  We loved this restaurant and love the vibe in the cosmopolitan.  We'll be back for sure!",

    "text": "We came here twice.  The second time service was awesome!  The waiter we had was so attentive and cool as in hip to everything.  The food was amazing and deliciously consistent with the New York location, but you're in Vegas!!!   It's nice they have seasonal items so there is always something new to try.  I started with the autumn vegetable soup (dreamy and creamy), my husband had the tartart special.  He loved it and wouldn't share.  Then we had a pasta course, I can't stop getting the spaghetti.....i can't!  Colin got the short rib agnolotti, which was very buttery good...  Then we had the nerve to share the 24 oz ribeye,  it was soooooo good, tender and perfectly seasoned.  We actually ate it all!  plus the sides, horseradish mashed potatoes....  Mario, the manager was extremely nice and helped us out with a service problem we experienced on our last visit and made everything perfect for this visit.  We did not expect the extra desserts brought out for us to try.  You have to try the little donuts (bomboloni) and the coconut panacotta was very tropical with a guava sauce...My favorite group, Depeche Mode was playing and when they found out, they changed the playlist to only play their songs!   There are so many choices of places to try in Vegas and this is a must.  Worth every penny and worth several more visits.",

    "text": "This place is wonderful!! Great service, ambiance and delicious food.  I was originally a bit turned off by the poor service of the hostess taking our reservation over the phone, but once we arrived the staff (especially our waiter, Mike) was very friendly and accommodating. We loved the ambiance: dim lighting, candles on the tables and stylish decor. We requested a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was really nice being able to look out from time to time even though there's a big bar on the window right at eye-level that makes it difficult to watch the fountain show without needing it lean over awkwardly.  Food: Overall, we really enjoyed our meal! Though there were a couple items I'd recommend against, we loved most of the dishes we tried. Here's a quick review of each item we ordered:  APPETIZERS  - Beet Salad: I enjoyed this, but it was my least favorite of the apps we ordered and could have used more beets.  - Roasted Sea Scallops: If you like seafood, this dish is a must! SO GOOD. It was my favorite item we ordered, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  - Creamy Polenta: Another amazing dish! Creamy, buttery perfection.  ENTREES  - Spaghetti: My boyfriend loved this! He said it was the best spaghetti he's had here in the states. The noodles and sauce reminded him of spaghetti in Venice, Italy. :-)  - Mediterranean Branzino: I was disappointed in this dish. The fish was bland and the overall flavor was nothing special.  DESSERTS  - Amedei Chocolate Cake: Loved this!! The only thing that would have made it better is more gelato. It only comes with a tiny scoop and goes quickly with how chocolaty the cake is. Simple solution: request extra gelato while ordering.  - Zeppole (with nutella center and vanilla sauce): We debated over getting this and splitting the two different desserts or just getting two chocolate cakes (which we knew we'd love). I'm so glad decided to give it a try as it ended up being our favorite!! I'd definitely recommend it to others dining here.",

    "text": "A hotel contact set me up for dinner here on a Friday night after a long day of touring venues for work.  Finally it was time to unwind!  The dining room is dimly lit and a great place for a special occasion/ or pre show dinner with your significant other.  Our server was quite nice, and attentive.  I was in the mood for some bivalves and got 1/2  a dozen. They were really small and disappointing and not really the best that I've had.  We also had the beef tartare which was also quite good, but not as good as the one at BIX in SF.   For entrees the husband had a ban seared fish, what type of fish it evades me, but it was cooked perfectly; crispy on the outside, soft and moist inside.  I had the lobster pasta of some sort, very rich and al dente,  I could certainly taste the flavor of the fresh herbs used in the butter sauce. I shared this with the husband and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The highlight was the fish entree and also the desserts.  We had the trio of bombolini-some kind of fried dough/beignets looking things. But when we bit into them, they had this glorious melted chocolate inside! Every fried bit of goodness had a different filling, one chocolate, the other custard, and I forget what the other ones, but they were fried bites of perfection!  It had nutella and vanilla creme inside. Yummy!  The other dessert was this fruit and creme concoction, sorry the name escapes my mind but it was definetely really good and really rich.   The server made a mistake and gave us a third dessert- the chocolate molten cake. It was also super good but by that time we were desserted out.   I don't know what the bill was as it was comped but I imagine maybe $150 for two with a glass of wine. Not bad for some really good bites and sinful dessert to go with it!  I would recommend if staying at the cosmos.",

    "text": "As guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . Maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night I don't know.  The door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . We thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .  Too start with I received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but I did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles.   We felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time I saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . I glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .  We started with the tuna susci -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was raw and everything had little taste.  We shared the short rib agnolotti , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. Maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.  The black cod although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that I found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .  My husband had the duck breast and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .  We had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . We ordered the zeppole I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to God they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the Sweet Tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them .   At this price range they don't have this much room for error.",

    "text": "Happy B-Day to ME!!!  Okay we decide to do vegas for my bday and I've been wanting to try out this place.  My good work friend of mine recommended it...shout out to Frank M. for the recommendation.  So I completely forget it's in vegas cause i'm a guy and have the attention span of a 2 year old.  But the wifey thinks of everything and yes I know I'm lucky and yes I tell her frequently.  We ordered: Bread Basket - Wow!  GREAT START!    Creamy Polenta - Magical buttery love potion.  Add to anything to make it better.  You can put this on cardboard and enjoy.  Roasted Sea Scallops - Cooked to utter perfection.  Texture was great.  Had a hint of fish to it but I loved it.  Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Although I have an extreme love of Foie Gras, this dish was just okay for me.  The texture and temperature of the Ravioli didn't mesh well with the Foie and it just clashed.  I had high hopes for this one.  Spaghetti - This was supposed to be my highlight.  I even went online and made this dish based on raves I've heard about it.  I have to say I wasn't impressed.  The spaghetti noodles were too thick and didn't have that homemade taste or texture to it.  It was served too cold for my taste as well.  Maybe the size of our group affected my experience here.  VERY SAD MOMENT when it hit my palette.  I probably should have asked them to redo it but the vodka had already soaked in and my enthusiasm was curbed.  Black Cod - Just a fish on a dish.  Flavors were okay but this didn't do much for me at all.  My worst fears had materialized.  The moment when you start so fast in the direction of brilliance just to be let down along the way.  I wouldn't say it was a complete let down as the dishes were all pretty well put together, however, that's all it was.  Great shit thrown on a plate...I didn't feel inspired...I wasn't brought anywhere...I was just at a restaurant in Vegas eating with my hot wife and a group of great friends.  It would have made the night perfection if the experience matched the bill.  *Thanks wifey for the extremely thought-filled dinner plan - You're loved*",

    "text": "What an awesome italian restaurant.  The entrance is super secluded, and as the hostess led us down an empty hallway it seemed like the place was abandoned, but the hallway opened up into a large dining room.  We were seated by the windows and could see the Bellagio fountains which was nice.      I got the Berry Smash to drink which was very average, a little too strong for my taste.  The bread basket they brought out was great, focacia, french bread and one more were average.  The best bread had salami and basil and maybe even cheese baked into it- SO GOOD.  There was a citrus olive oil to dip in, as well as butter, and an eggplant tomato spread.  Definitely helped to liven up the more basic bread.        The duck and foie gras ravioli were great.  First time having foie gras and we were not disappointed.  Rich and delicious.  The spaghetti was unreal good- I did not think spaghetti could be that great.  Finally, the veal chop looked great, and was very rich and tender.  The chocolate cake for dessert was probably the low point- it reminded us of an Applebee's dessert, although the presentation was slightly better than that.        The only other con was our server- he was very awkward and seemed to appear at all the wrong times to talk to us about the menu.  He rambled on about dishes just a little too much.        Would definitely have given a 5 with a different server and had we picked a different and hopefully better dessert.",

Of course we came yesterday the table wasnt next to the window but when I look at the tables next to the window you can see people come inside the restaurant ask for a bable next to the window and get it....nevermind about it. The host is American but all the waiters are Mexicans,  I do not have problem with that but you Hardly can Understand what they say or when they talking between them you don't understand Because they Speak Spanish,  I Find it rude and not respect the place. When we seated a waiter come to us and ask if we want a bottle of wine,  we says \"no\" and he brought 2 glass with water and that's pretty much ends our relationship with the waiters. after that come waiter brought brad and started to explain about the brad and left. We couldnt understand a word he say. After 15 mins come finally our waiter and ask what he want to eat I told him what I want and told him the only reason I choose this restaurant because I saw you have here vegetarian menu because my bf is Vegan, so the waiter brought him this menu and left we needed to wait more 15- 20 mins until he came back to the table, and then when my bf told him what he want to order the waiter say that all the pasta made with eggs in the vegetarian menu so he can't order any pasta !!!!! After we waited 20 min !!! And after he choose something to eat! You don't want to know what he ends with! After a while when the food  came the waiter comes to me few time to ask if I finish to eat and 3 times I said no. After he took the plate he didn't offer us dessert menu he just left to different tables and ignor us for good!!! After another 15 min I needed to call him for bring the check he didn't say nothing he brought it and gone!  Very disgusting treatment , the food is actually good! But the treatment so bad! I swear I never come to this restaurant again.",

My wife and I were seated at a two seat table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. She got a beautiful view of the fountains and I got a view of a wall. Other than those two things, The ambience and atmosphere were very nice.  I had the beef tartare appetizer and the lobster pasta and they were both off the hook. The handmade pasta is the real deal. My wife had the oysters appetizer and swordfish. Both were very good but not out of this world.   The service was nice and accommodating.

    "text": "Really, yelp needs to allow for 1/2 stars, because Scarpetta is definitely a solid 5 stars, but Hubby wanted to knock off a 1/2 star for overly spicy Lobster Pici.  Easily one of the best meals we've had in Vegas.  Came here with another couple, and we each ordered a different dish.  Had polenta w/ truffled mushrooms, and salad w/ burrata and roasted beets to start.  We wanted to lick the polenta bowl when we finished, it was that good.  The beets were tasty, too, but the Polenta.... Molto Bene!!  Lobster Pici -- fantastic, but the chili pesto was a bit overpowering (Hubby burst into a sweat within the first bite). Short Rib & Bone Marrow agnolotti -- Rich, luscious, and not exactly heart healthy, but oh my god good. Raviolini w/ ricotta and truffle -- not on the online menu.  Super tasty, and you'll want to have extra bread on your table to sop up every last drop of the sauce (hence the name, Scarpetta!). Veal tortellini -- one of the special dishes offered that night, easily the best pasta we had.  With shaved baby carrots on top, each bite was perfectly savory w/ a touch of sweetness.  For dessert, we ordered the Amedei chocolate cake and pumpkin souffle.  About 15 minutes later, our waiter (\"hot as hell\" Luis) appeared sheepishly at our table to apologize profusely that the souffle were not meeting the expectations of the kitchen so they were in the process of starting a new batch.  Which would take an hour.  :( While our friends were disappointed, we did give serious props to the kitchen for not serving sub-par food.  So we ordered the Bomboloni instead.  Which were \"the bomb!\"  One of the best parts of the meal, though, was the little surprise Luis presented us with at the end of our meal... to again apologize for the souffle flop, he went next door to D.O.C.G. and got us a dish of the salted caramel budino.  Seriously, that was a little bit of heaven in a bowl (another 'wanna lick the bowl' moment).  Luis and the rest of the staff were fantastic, and we felt like they bent over backwards to make sure we had a fantastic experience.  Oh yeah... and we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains while we ate.  We waddled out of there fat 'n' happy, and found the pricing to be quite reasonable.  Especially for Vegas.    We will be back to Scarpetta, without a doubt.",

Our service was extremely slow and just lacking in every way. It was still early by Vegas standards (730) so I don't really get the lack of attentiveness. We ordered wine which did not come until AFTER our first course. Finally our spagetti comes....oh, so SALTY...it tasted nothing like the last time. Our server must have known something was amiss as he never once asked how we were enjoying our meal. We also waited a good 45 minutes to be offered dessert---or the check by this time. We finally had to wave someone down to get the bill since we were DONE with this place.  Such a shame. We have had many great food adventures in Vegas, this evening was not one of them. If you really want to have some spagetti that will change your life then come out out to California and enjoy the Scarpetta at the Montage.",

    "text": "Unfortunately it has gone downhill - two stars for service and food - whereas it used to be one of my faves. We had a large party and the chef refused to give us the tasting menu as a few vegetarians weren't interested - Chef said via our server that it would \"ruin the dining experience\" because not everyone would do it. With our dining experience thus ruined by not being able to get the tasting menu, our party almost left, but I convinced everyone to stay because the food had been so stellar before. Which was a mistake. Service was painfully slow. My burrata was good but tagliatelle was just meh. Same mixed experience for the rest of the group. Bread was yummy but even with knowing we had vegetarians at the table, they served the meat filled bread in the same basket as the other bread - just lazy. Only bright spot worth the extra star was the sommelier who made our night with some great wines. We won't return.",

The Vegas one has a gorgeous view of Bellagio's fountain and the decor is more old, rustic and not as classy and glamorous as the LA one. The waiter here is very helpful and funny.    The food here is delicious:  + Beef Tartare: Cooked with lime juice so quite sour but refreshing. Very different from traditional beef tartare. + Raw Yellowtail: It's okay. Pretty typical, but I'm surprise how non-fatty the fish taste considering hamachi is a fattier fish. + The spaghetti: good as always--al dente with a sauce that's sweet with a hint of tang.  + Tagliatelle: A pasta with spring veggies. This tasted too green and peas-filled for me. The cream sauce also too thick.  + Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: This was delicious but the foie gras taste is very mild.  + Mediterranean Branzino: The fish has a really, really nice sear on the outside and it was very soft and tasty.   Don't skip dessert! Dessert was phenomenal!   + Strawberry Tart : The tart crust was amazing! It has that crunch and the cream was so light. The meringue that came with the dessert didn't taste like basil as described, but it was still really good.   +and the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bomboloni: Reminds me of hot bigne with creamy nutty chocolate center! It's so good. And I have no idea how they caramelized a banana. It has the crunch and then creaminess of the fruit.",

Everything from the wine to the ambiance to the food was fantastic, absolutely zero complaints from our group of 4. They have a great location in the Cosmopolitan overlooking the Bellagio fountains, request a seat by the windows for a great view. Their pastas are all homemade and delicious and I highly recommend making room for a couple of those if you can, but whatever you choose you really can't go wrong!",

I'm sure there are other Vegas establishments more on the wow factor, but pricewise for food and the experience, yes. Please do visit.  I came here with a friend and were able to request and get a seat by the window that looks over to the Bellagio water fountains. Pretty cool I must say.  The bread. Oh my. They serve awesome bread here! There was a piece of sourdough bread on top of the basket covering two pieces of warm wheat type bread, two rosemary focaccia, and our favorite, cheese and salami wrapped bread!!! This last one was soooooo yummy!! The awesome bread basket came with salted butter, a tomato tapenade, and olive oil. Oh my, we finished most of the bread basket, except the rosemary focaccia and had to ask for a second round of bread to accompany our meal! Yes, that good. The salami cheese bread was probably my most favorite thing for dinner lol.  I ordered the Lobster Pici, which was good. There were large pieces of lobster meat in it! There better be if it costed $38! The pici was cooked perfectly. Nothing worng with this dish, but tasted like something I could have made at home.   My friend ordered the Ricotta and Mushroom Agnolotti. This was really good. I had a few pieces and the wrapper on the agnolotti was super soft! It should be since they make their own spaghetti everyday.  My first choice for entree though was the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. Un/lucky for me, my other friend went to dinner before me and had some leftovers, which I was able to try. These little suckers were really good heated up so I can only imagine what they would have tasted like if I ordered at dinner and the plate set in front of me. Drools... So, I would recommend this dish definitely!!  All in all, a really good dinner! The staff was all super professional, accommodating, and attentive. Good job staff!",

The server promptly greeted us to take our drink order - their wine and cocktail menu had a nice selection.  Another server dropped off a bread basket filled with a warm variety (including spinach filled foccacia, sourdough, and a salami baked roll), along with marscapone infused butter, and citrus olive oil for dipping. Service was attentive and the ambience romantic. For an appetizer we tried the Frito Misto (lightly fried veggies, calamari, and shrimp). Our main entrees were Kobe flat iron (seasoned well and accompanied by creamy gnocchi) and short rib aglonotti (which was rich in consistency and flavor from the brown butter and horseradish breadcrumbs). Our evening was memorable, and the chef has done well for himself here.",

This was easily the best meal I had in Vegas, and quite possibly the best Italian I've had outside of my study abroad experience in Florence, Italy. It's got the perfect dining ambiance (perfect for a date with a significant other, or if you're me... your mom) with a view to boot (we watched the Bellagio fountains go off all night)!  Our waiter was absolutely adorable and I don't know how they managed to crank out their food so fast, but we were in and out within an hour. I wasn't really in the mood for anything heavy, but I'm a sucker for carbs and a good pasta dish, so I went with the short rib agnolotti, and my mom had the tagliatelle. Hoooly mother of all that is savory and delicious! The portions seem small, but man that plate of pasta will fill you up just right, while saving JUST enough room for that nutella and vanilla bombolini dessert, which I HIGHLY recommend. In fact, I wasn't even quick enough to snap a pic of this delicacy for Yelping purposes prior to absolutely devouring it, so you KNOW it was good.  The night definitely wasn't our cheapest meal in Vegas by any means, but it was definitely worth the splurge.",

While waiting for our table to be ready, we had a couple drinks at the bar. They had a happy hour menu, and the drinks were solid and cheap.   The waiter gave us a basket of bread and tomato paste and two kinds of olive oil to start us with. There was a variety of bread. My favorite was the roll with salami in it. They were all very fresh and delicious. It was even better when I ate them with my pasta. We ordered the Mediterranean Octopus ($21) for appetizer. They were very thoughtful and divided the portion in half on a separate plate. For the entree, we ordered the Spaghetti ($25) and Pici ($36). I wasn't expecting much for the pasta because I thought, \"I mean, how good could it be? It's just pasta.\" Oh boy, was I wrong! The Spaghetti was a simple dish, but the sauce was creamy and fresh. The Pici was hands down, the best pasta I've ever had! It was worth every penny. The pesto was so delicious and went really well with the lobster. The lobster was soft and tender. Both of the dishes were not overpowering with cheese or sauce, which I really liked. I think they also make their own noodles. They were very chewy - in a good way!  On top of the wonderful view and food, the waiter was really friendly and funny. He was very down-to-earth and honest about his recommendations. Scarletta was such a pleasant experience - I think the best restaurant I've been in Vegas! Cannot wait to come back here again.",

After moving to Los Angeles, I went to the one in Beverly Hills pretty often (until they closed recently) and enjoyed every experience there, too.  We got to Vegas fairly late on a Friday night and I was excited to find out that Scarpetta was still open. We were seated quickly and I knew everything that I wanted to order (short rib risotto, spaghetti, and the chicken).   Directly in front of our table, there was a table of 4, one person that was visibly very intoxicated. I wasn't surprised at all since it is Vegas and a Friday night. However, the waiter kept serving the entire table more wine, even as this guy was slurring and barely able to hold himself up.   I'm halfway into my risotto when I notice him put his head down on the table. The restaurant is fairly empty at this point so there are a lot of staff just standing around. By the time I'm done with the risotto, he's completely lying down in his booth. My spaghetti comes out, and as I take a bite of my delicious food, I look up to see the guy projectile vomit. It's splashing all over the booth and the sound is as gross as the actual view.  The staff get over there and start cleaning up and a few minutes later, someone stops by at our table to see how we're doing. I tell him we've obviously lost our appetite and he asks if we would like our plates (which are nearly untouched) packed up. They bring us our food in to go boxes along with the bill.  So I'm not an unreasonable person. I don't blame Scarpetta for a drunk person in Vegas on a Friday night. The issue I have is that they continued to serve drinks to him, leading to him vomiting in front of other patrons. After that, we don't even get an apology, the manager doesn't stop by, and we're asked to pay for the entire bill.   The situation was handled poorly by their staff, and I still had to pay for the entire crappy experience.",

    "text": "I was planning my friend's bachelorette party in Vegas and she wanted to do one fancy shmancy dinner.  I had two restaurants in mind and when she told me she wanted Italian, Scarpetta was the way to go.  I requested a table by the window so we can see the Bellagio water show.  The hostess said it was not guaranteed, but they will try their best to accommodate.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were led into a private room with the view we requested.  I really couldn't have been any happier.  SIKE!  The food was effing amazing.  I was afraid some of the girls wouldn't eat (picky eaters), but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered the veal chop ($68).  No regrets there though because I practically licked my plate after.  It was so juicy.  Normally, I don't like any pieces of fat.  I will literally gag at the table and throw up right then and there, but it melted in my mouth.  It was like a clean fat.  I honestly don't know how to describe it.  Ohmygawd.  We ended our dinner with dessert.  I was not disappointed in any of our choices.    Don't forget that bread basket at the beginning!  I think we asked for two refills.  Another great thing about this place is that they make their pasts in house.",

    "text": "I might as well start with the one thing that the restaurant got right: service. Everything else was a disaster.  Let's start with the menu. I am still trying to figure out how they came up with this menu. Did they Google \"fancy Italian menu\"? Did they copy Olive Garden's and just add in some more fancy ingredients? One will never know. What I do know, however, is that a 44 ounce steak is probably not something one eats in Italy. I'm also pretty sure vegetable medley and dishes served with only a starch are not something I've ever seen in a fine dining establishment.  Now, let's move on to the food: the absolute worst part of the evening. I ordered the osso buco, which I'll understate as absolutely disgusting. The tomato sauce was sour, watery, and lacked any flavor or complexity whatsoever. The veal shank was dry and not seasoned at all. The polenta had no flavor and was covered in bland cheese. Had my server brought me Pizza Hut instead, it would have been an upgrade.  If somehow Cosmo could move the excellent servers to another one of their restaurants and then bulldoze the daylights out of the disaster that is Scarpetta, the world would be a better place. Save yourself the money and eat at the many restaurants in Las Vegas that are actually good.",

    "text": "Had a fantastic dinner at Scarpetta on a Thursday night.  I'd had reservations here on 4 previous occasions and had to cancel for one reason or another every time.  Finally I was getting to try this joint.  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  The restaurant is larger than I was expecting, and if it wasn't full, it was very close.  Lively atmosphere, almost loud, but not quite.  I wouldn't say it would be good for a romantic evening, but it was great for a night out with friends.  Our server immediately approached us and presented us with an impressive wine list.  It may not be the best I've seen on the Strip, but it was well above average.  The prices are typical for a restaurant located in a higher end hotel on the Strip, so you might have some sticker shock.  We went with a barolo which was fantastic.  Service was great throughout the evening, no complaints at all.  In addition to the wine list, we were brought the bread basket.  This has various types of bread, but the one that stood out had bacon and cheese.  It tastes as good as it sounds.  I might try to steal some the next time I eat there to make a sandwich with it the next day, it was great.  To start, our table of 4 split 2 pastas:  the short rib agnolotti and the ricotta cavatelli with wild boar ragu and arugula.  The waiter advised that they were small dishes, so we went with 2 orders of the agnolotti.  Very glad we did, the amount we received was a perfect starter, but splitting the dishes among 4 would have been a stretch.  Both pastas were cooked to a perfect al dente.  Some of the best pasta I've had.  The short rib was very tender and flavorful, and the pasta to filling ratio was great.  Likewise, the wild boar ragu was incredible.  Rich and very deep flavors were seasoned perfectly.  I would be able to just eat a ton of this with a spoon, it was fantastic.  I'd even eat it cold.    To eat, I went with the special of the evening:  veal osso bucco with risotto.  The veal shank was large and fork tender.  Full disclosure, a buddy of mine ordered this dish as well and his was NOT fork tender.  I saw him use a knife on more than one occasion throughout the meal.  Mine, however, was fantastic.  The meat was moist and melted in your mouth.  It's not the best osso bucco I've had, that honor still goes to the mighty Ferraro's, but it was an A dish for me.  The risotto was cooked well, but had a bit too much citrus for me.  But, I liked the dish enough to keep Scarpetta at 5 stars.  This place isn't cheap, but you can find a LOT higher prices on the Strip and the food you get won't be worth the additional cost.  I had a great deal of anticipation for eating at Scarpetta, and I was not let down.  I've found a new Italian place for my rotation next time I'm in town.",

Came here for dinner one night with a good friend of mine and we took advantage of the 3 course dinner offered for restaurant week. Our waiter was awesome! We got a seat not to far from the window and got a small view of the Bellagio fountains. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees to share, all were extremely tasty, but my favorite had to be the fish, crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside, seasoned well and definitely not overcooked. The desserts were amazing too.   Our waiter provided the best service, super attentive, anticipated our needs, refilled our drinks constantly, catered to us which is exactly what makes or breaks a meal. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "We were very excited to take my Mom to Scarpetta for her 75th birthday. We do love watching Scott Conant, and as much as he talks about Italian food, we looked forward to eating it. We realize Conant himself wasn't there cooking for us, but the restaurant is under his name and reputation, and is pricy, so we expected a top-notch experience. What we got was a NICE meal, but a forgettable one.   First off, the ambiance in the restaurant, while classy-themed, was far too dark and somewhat noisy, with tables too close together for a real experience of a special meal. Each of the 4 of us had to use our phones for enough light to see the menu clearly. And we all have good eyesight normally. Our waiter was promising at first, with a friendly and timely acknowledgment of our group, and getting our drink orders. He came back in a timely manner for our drink delivery and meal orders, but was basically non-existent for the rest of the evening. I realize Friday night is a busy night, but.....not only do we want to feel important, no matter how many other diners there are, but we had let the restaurant know ahead of time, that it was a special birthday for our mom (don't tell her I told you, but it's her 75th ;)  ), and that if we could maybe have a special table and some acknowledgment of her birthday, we'd sure appreciate it.  Our table was dead center in the room, which was disappointing. :(  The food was definitely good. Not memorable or amazing, but good. Our two starters were the way too salty yellowtail crudo, and the amazingly tasty polenta. My mom LOVES yellowtail, and didn't even want a second taste, because it was too salty. The polenta, however, was the star of the meal. For entrees, 2 of us chose the lamb bolognese, topped with fresh burrata. This was a tasty dish, but honestly....the pasta wasn't all that special. It was too dense and heavy. The taste of the dish was very nice, though. My mom had the Branzino, and it was tasty...best entree for our table. My sister had the chicken dish, which was good, but again, nothing memorable. We did have a dessert to share, amongst the table. It was the mascarpone cheesecake, and was delicious.  Our bill was actually lower than we'd expected, and with all things included, drinks, food and tip, we paid $320.   I probably wouldn't heavily recommend Scarpetta to foodies, honestly. As I said, it was a good meal, but the dense pasta and the not-so-amazing service really brought the level of excitement and enjoyment for our meal down a notch or two.",

    "text": "Scarpetta is a dark, intimate, upscale Italian restaurant with nice views of the Strip and the Bellagio fountains in the distance.  We had some really good dishes here and would definitely recommend, especially if you like seafood with pasta.  Service was friendly but timing a bit off with the fish coming out way before our pasta dish and them forgetting about our side dish.  Still, solid 4 stars!  Their free bread basket is one of the best - nice variety of plain and some with some nice, Mediterranean-inspired filling. You get a triple-dip tray of olive oil, a savory tapenade, and mascarpone!   The Berry Smash cocktail is sweet with the mix of blueberries and white cranberry juice.  It goes down smoothy but a few minutes you will get the buzz!    For apps, we shared the grilled octopus. It was tender, well-seasoned of course and what made this dish a winner is that their olives and potato condiments also had a nice balanced taste. Olives not too briny nor salty - just perfect.  I got the Branzino with saffron broth, a pretty good dish albeit on the lighter side.  It had some nice clams and shrimp pieces to go with the fish, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned enough for me.  My wife's black pasta dish with sea urchin and crabmeat however, was outstanding.  It looked super rich and tiny at first, but after mixing everything up it turned out to be very filling. Best of all, it wasn't super rich.  This has got to be one of their signature dishes - why need sauce when uni and crab meat are already perfect together.  For dessert we shared the mascarpone cheesecake and Greek Yogurt (sorbet?).  Excellent dish that easily feeds two.  We dislike dense cheesecake that tends to be too heavy and rich, but Scarpetta's version was light and smooth.  It almost had a panna cotta texture.  The Greek Yogurt was sweet and chilled and reminded us more like a side of ice cream. No reason you can't make a sorbet or have Greek Froyo I suppose. Wonderful dessert, and perfect end to a great dinner.",

Moscow was pretty strong, however it was tart and not sweet enough.. could have used a shot of simple syrup.   Food. I ordered their Filet Minion, medium rare of course. The inside was cooked fine, however the outside was way to seared... it was basically charred. The meat, was pretty dry and the sauce they provide on the plate was for decoration and not enough to last your $48 piece of meat.  The Wife ordered some ravioli in some lemon sauce which was okay, but I like my sauce thicker and richer.   Ambiance. A scooch to dark, but it was the bar area since the restaurant was booked.  In conclusion, I recommend passing. To expensive for the mediocre food and drinks you get in return.",

I was impress with the view, decor and service. I got the foie gras ravioli and it was amazing! Ravioli was perfectly cooked, foie gras filling was not too overwhelming, sauce was well balanced and complimented the dish very well.  Sommelier Kyle was very helpful in helping us decide on a nice bottle of wine to go with our dish. Staff was very patient and attentive with us especially because a few friends were running late.  I didn't feel rushed to put in an order. It was a nice relaxing evening catching up with some old friends.",

    "text": "So this place was great! I usually never go out for Italian because it rarely impresses me.  Scarpetta surprised me.  We had the lobster pasta which was greet and had a little spice/kick to it.  The short rib agnolotti was brilliant.  I just wish there was more of it!  It has a crispy texture which I loved.    I will say that I didnt like oysters.  They had mascarpone cheese which I just found odd and took flavor from the oysters. I was told after that you can ask for them plain...  They have a decent wine selection and we opted for an Italian red.  It was good and the price was decent.  Lastly we tried the chocolate cake with armaretto ice cream which was darn tasty.    If you're in the mood for Italian and you're in Vegas .  Come here.",

Once we were seated and given the menu, I realized that the online menu and actual menu don't match up.   The menu is very limited with only a few choices per menu section. There was nothing on the menu that I was willing to eat. Spaghetti was not even on the menu! I ended up leaving and going someplace else.  I would think that a restaurant owned by a cooking competition judge would make sure that the menu was correct. Kind of a big deal",

Our waiter was friendly and had us sitting in near a window table over looking the Bellagio fountain which was perfect. The place is for sure intimate, romantic and perfect to share a meal with a loved one.  We ordered the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli which was rich, buttery and savory. The ravioli is tender and cooked to perfection. The sauce was just enough to not be overwhelming and enough for each bite. And the foie gras... oh boy! just perfection in this dish. So good that you totally do not want to share, but try too. I'm sure your date will also love it. And if you have room for dessert, I highly recommend the bombolini to share. Warm, sugar and cinnamon coated baked goodies that seem to be what would be if donut holes and churros had a baby.",

The restaurant has vibes all around to the lighting, seating and love that the wine cellar can be seen through glass.  Make sure to bring your $$$ drinks are pricey starting at $20 but are amazing!  Purchasing a bottle of wine is worth it for the money.  The dinner menu is unique and was sooo good! We started with the Mediterranean octopus then worked our way to the entrees. I had the Duck & foie gras ravioli that was delicious $28. My love had the short rib agnolotti pasta $26 and left his plate clean.  Our friends had no complaints about their entrees and the desserts were life. The bill was hefty but a must stop if your visiting the Cosmo.",

We showed up on a Tuesday evening (8:30pm) not busy at all-   I wanted this to be a surprise for my wife to view the fountains and enjoy her Italian meal-   We were sat a row over from the window, when there was a two seat table clearly open and available for at least 1/2 hour.   We asked but were told it was not available- again, I understand. But what got to us is the slow service and how attentive the waiters were with other tables- most of them had wine service- we chose not to because of the cost   Our waiter was an older, Italian man, bald- I spoke with someone of an Italian accent. Before arriving at this restaurant we checked yelp and the reviews for this establishment which the majority of them at five stars including SERVICE.   Service at this establishment when we were there was that minimal two stars. We felt out of place uncomfortable. We just wanted to order and leave.   Of course I was going to try their famous spaghetti which was out of this world amazing I had it with the meatballs my wife had the John Dory fish again hands-down amazing.   About half hour later a male couple were seated at the empty table next to the Windows-   And the reason I'm complaining about this is because this is not the first time we have felt like that at a nice restaurant on the strip in Las Vegas on Monday when we arrived we dined at another fine restaurant on the strip and same thing-   It's visibly noticeable how if you have money and spending it well, you get treated differently- again, it's VEGAS, we understand-   I'd rather have exceptional customer service and ok food, than great food and lousy service-   It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. More the reason why I dislike Vegas so much now-   So, to summarize, their famous spaghetti is to die for !!! Their John Dory fish plate- out of this world-   service was no bueno- sorry-   Thank you -",

We were also surprised when the waiter noticed a member of a group wasn't feeling the best, and offered help to her as well!   The food: truly amazing! I loved the tuna crudo. Everyone in my group that ordered pasta raved about how amazing it was. Their gluten feee spaghetti is also homemade!! The desserts are also great, they surprised me with a congratulations plate as well.   The ambience is nice and intimate. The windows also overlook the bellagio fountains, which is great!

We were seated at a window table where the sun was blinding my boyfriend as well as someone at the table next to us and they both had to block it with menus until the sun set. It took awhile after being seated for our waiter to come. After ordering the bread took a long time to come. Once entrees and sides arrived, I was given the wrong meal and had to wait for my Spaghetti. There was fuzz/paper in our asparagus. My boyfriend got the Short Rib Agnolotti and said it tasted different. We had an extra side after ordering our mains but then the waiter tried to take it away not realizing. It seemed like there was confusion throughout the whole meal and took away from the experience. Disappointing.",

Scarpetta is a smaller restaurant, very intimate, romantic, and dimly lit, with a more modern decor. They have one back wall that overlooks the strip and the Bellagio fountains.   We had the chef choose our dishes for dinner. Everything was so rich and absolutely amazing! I can't rave enough about the quality of their food! Every dish we had did not disappoint in the least! I was expecting smaller dishes as this is an upscale Italian restaurant, but the portion sizes were very generous and filling.  A few dishes I highly recommend and wouldn't leave without trying are: -Beef Carpacio with beats, hazelnuts, and goat cheese -Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli with a marsala glaze -Kobe Beef Ribcap (best piece of meat I think I may have ever had)  Hands down, definitely worth trying and spending a romantic date night here!",

I got some polenta appetizer, and the spaghetti, plus the salmon, needless to say I could barely eat any of my salmon.  We tried the brownie, cheesecake and the donuts. Cheesecake was my favorite, they topped it off with ice cream on both the brownie and the cheesecake.. let's be honest everything taste even ten times better with the ice cream.

    "text": "So we stopped into this place after arriving too early for a concert we were taking my daughter to. We walked around Cosmo checking out all the restaurants they have to offer and they have a lot!!  Their menu looked really nice so we decided to try it out.   Even though we didn't have reservations, the hostess was extremely nice and sat us right away. Walking in this place is gorgeous!! Just plain stunning!  We got sat near a the window were you can oversee Bellagio fountains. Beautiful views!    Our waiter greeted us promptly and nicely. Got our drink order told us the specials. They brought us a bread basket with some delicious bread and 3 different spreads for them.  For apps we ordered calamari (best we've had in a long time) very crispy and fluffy batter, oysters topped with caviar and beef carpaccio (a little dry but still tasty).  For dinner we got 3 amazing dishes which I can't pronounce or spell 2 of them. Lol.   Daughter got the Tuna crudo. She loved it. Wife and I shared the duck and foi gra raviolis. These were delicious!!  Very rich!  And the Lamb and burrata pasta. Equally delicious!   The staff were all very genuinely nice and attentive.  And even though we (well me) didn't look like a million $$ they still treated us like it.  Was it pricey? We considering it's on the strip and you can taste the quality of the food, I'd say no. But it is a high end dinner for sure!",

The staff was very accommodating and we browsed the menu previously so we were able to place our orders immediately. The cocktail menu was nice and I ordered the berry smash which was delicious. I chose the tagliatelle with lamb bolognese and truffle burrata for my entree. Hands down, this was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The gravy was so rich, the ground lamb was plentiful and the noodles were perfect. The creamy burrata was also a great touch.   The restaurant is gorgeous! Our friends reserved a table at the window so that we could have views of the Bellagio Fountains. The views were amazing and we were able to get some great pictures. The staff was even nice enough to snap a few pics as well. I'd highly recommend coming here for a romantic evening in Vegas.",

They seated us promptly as soon as all members of our party were present. I ordered the Riesling and a Black Tagliolini, which was very unique. My friend ordered the special of the day, the risotto, which was okay, but definitely not worth $50. Everything else was great! We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, but my favorite was definitely the yellowtail sashimi. It was slightly spicy and had a kick, and I loved it! The entrees were surprisingly filling - we were all nervous that the portions would be small since this was a relatively fancy place, but we ended up having a bunch of leftovers. I tried a little bit of all the dishes, and my favorite was the pappardelle with meat sauce. Since it was our friends birthday, we also got a complimentary treat at the end, which was very nice.",

The service was great.  Every single person from hostess to maitre d to waiter to bus boys was incredibly attentive and friendly.  The food was fantastic.  We had the tasting menu.  It's a great deal for $85 per person.  So much food, you won't come out hungry. They've selected the dishes they are best known for as part of their tasting menu.  I love how the first couple courses are paired with another dish that is shared by the table.  It feels like you are having 10 dishes!  We also did the wine pairing.  Very generous pours.  My favorite dishes were the short rib agnoletti and home-made pasta.  Devine meal.  Definitely will come back and try some other dishes!  Scott Conant and his team have done a fabulous job.",

We made a reservation because, online it said that they were recommended, but there were not many people in the place. We got the suggested appetizer of the Tuna Susci and it was delicious! The waiter even had the kitchen split it onto two plates so my boyfriend and I could share.  It was delicious with white truffles in the middle and very well seasoned. My boyfriend ordered the black squid pasta with seafood because the reviews raved about it--it really wasn't that great.  It actually smelled and tasted a little overly fishy, but he was a good sport and ate it all.  I order the duck breast, and the duck was cooked perfectly.  The only suggestion I have is that the duck was cut VERY thick and there was not enough of the delicious orange glaze.  It was good, but not over the top amazing.  We were pretty full but ordered the strawberry shortcake for dessert---OMG AMAZING!  It definitely made up for the mediocre dinner. The service was really great, the dinner was blah, and the dessert was really good.  I would recommend this place, BUT I would not come here again.  There are too many other great restaurants in Las Vegas, this definitely has the atmosphere but I do not think our dinner was worth 150$.",

The short rib agnolloti and the duck and foie gras ravioli were two amazing pastas that are very unique to the restaurant.  The entrees did not live up to the first two courses but the baby goat was satisfying. I wouldn't recommend the halibut.  The head chef Scott Conant was in the restaurant which is very rare for Vegas. When you head to this restaurant stick mostly with the pastas and appetizers and you will have a unique and enjoyable dining experience.",

Now, you may think I'm neurotic about lighting but I don't care - it adds a lot to a dining experience. This lighting was just right. Goldilocks would have given a stamp of approval. Likewise for the portion size, which I thought may be too small like most pricey restaurants but it was just enough. The food was amazing. My fiance had the veal. Mouthwatering. I had the bone marrow and short rib pasta. Tasty. And with my Pinot - extra tasty. Now I'm not a sweet person (you can read that many ways), but the Nutella dessert was worth every last cent! Perfection. Service - impeccable. Well informed, classy, but not intrusive. And he had interesting hair. He also suggested an espresso martini, which was palate-ably scrumptious. And if you go, sit next to the window for a killer view of the Bellagio fountain at night.",

But seriously, they MUST have Italian grandmas cranking out homemade pasta by the pound. Easily the best Italian food I've had. Definitely an upscale place. I've had several food items (spaghetti, foie gras and duck ravioli, ribeye, multiple glasses of wine, raw yellowtail, pici, short ribs, and the dessert doughnuts) and every single thing is delicious. Service is perfect, I was never in want of anything. Servers are knowledgeable and passionate about what they're serving. Also wonderful wine recommendations. Something that I din't expect is getting the best steak I've had in this city here. Their ribeye is without a doubt the finest piece of red meat I've had in my life. If STK is too busy (it is), but you still want a great steak, come on over to Scarpetta. You will not be disappointed. Another great thing to mention is the view. Wanna wow your lady with a great view of the Bellagio fountains? Make a reservation and request it.",

The short rib appetizer is much better, but disappointingly small serving. Got the seafood pasta of crab, lobster, and shrimp. The seafood portion is generous, but the flat pasta sticks together and congeals into a doughy mess. Finally, the hostess was rude and obnoxious. Come on, your job is to just seat people and answer basic questions. You can't be polite? Overall, Spago is much better bang for your buck in Las Vegas.",

I gave my credit card to Scarpetta'swaiter on 12/31/12 around 11:15pm to pay our New Year Eve dinner bill. 2 preset menus, A la carte filet for my daughter, champagne and generous gratuity. Slightly over $1000.00. So far nothing wrong. We left the restaurant and went back home. Around  0:05am on 01/01/13. someone at Scarpetta ran my credit card again. This time for $864,-- I noticed the issue a couple of days later. I did call Scarpetta and explained the situation to the hostess. She assured me that the manager would return my call and would certainly correct this mistake. The manager never called me back. I filed a claim with my credit card company the next day as I did not want to waste my time calling Scarpetta again or drive there to try resolving this error. My credit card company credited back my account right away. However, Scarpetta did resubmit the charge along with apparently supporting documentation. My guess is that the so called supporting documentation is copy of card credit card receipt with some sort of a forged signature). Unfortunately, my credit card company had to re-bill the charge to my account and now I must provide my credit card company with additional information/documentation to support my claim. Since I must now waste my time supporting my claim, I will also file a police report. I am probably not an isolated case.  BRAVO SCARPETTA",

    "text": "Last Friday we came in at 9.30. The place was packed and the girls at the reception told us that we could eat at the bar or at the small tables on the opposite side of the bar. We choose to wait at the bar for a table in the restaurant, where it seemed to be more quiet. They told us the wait could be up to an hour, but we didn't really care.  We allready had a few cocktails before we came in, so I started to drink lots of water. We had to share our snack basket (patato chips, nice!) with the people sitting next to us. They shove it to their side of the bar, we didn't steal it back, so far the enjoyment of snacks.   After about 30 minutes it seemed like more and more people came in without reservation, but they were all given a table in the restaurant. We were still enjoying the bottled water, but after an hour waiting, my boyfriend walked up to the reception and they made our table ready, thanking us for the long wait. When we were seated, we noticed that the restaurant wasn't that full anymore. We were seated at a table apart from the other guest, in the corner of an almost empty room, where it wasn't that warm. They gave us some really nice bread and I didn't want to be snobby, but I did ask for another table. They were very nice and gave us a table by the window, overlooking the B fountains. Not that we especially wanted that, but we did like to sit closer to other people. Experiencing a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's also he temperature, the views, looking at other guest and the over all service.  Anyway, after this, everything was great. My boyfriend and I shared 4 courses, which were all perfectly made: the tartare, the foie gras ravioli, the organic chicken and the goat cheese cake. I was really stuffed (I also had 3 bottles of water) and happy. Service was great, although we were asked a little to much if everything was okay. In Holland we are not used to all that attentiveness.  6 stars for the food, 4 for the somewhat weird start = 5 stars.",

    "text": "First off, I would have to say Scarpetta's service is impeccable.  If we could just rate our waiter alone, we would give him a 5 star rating!  He was knowledgeable, friendly, and humble.  I have seen far too many waiters in Vegas who don't care, or are extremely snooty because my husband and I look young even though we're not.    As for the food, we order the scallops as the appetizer, and the duck and foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti as our entree.  For the scallops-I feel that it was good-but I have had better.  The duck and foie gras ravioli is their stand out dish!!  The wine reduction and marsala sauce on top of the ravioli made it so delicious.  The actual ravioli themselves are shaped like triangles.  I can tell there that is this delicacy to the outside when they were making it.  The duck and foie gras inside is very unique, and not like anything my husband and I have tasted before.  This dish deserves a 5 star.  Finally, for the spaghetti.  I was extremely excited to try this dish because I read all these reviews on yelp explaining that it was amazing.  However, we were a little disappointed maybe because we were expecting so much.  Don't get me wrong-the pasta is still good.  However, it's not the amazing that it was made out to be.  Overall, if I could give Scarpetta a 4 1/2 stars, I would.  My husband and I will definitely be back if when we go back to Vegas.",

For entrees, two of us had the duck and foie gras ravioli, which I will be dreaming about for a long time; the aged sirloin; and the spaghetti. One of us had dessert (yeah, that would be me), a coconut panna cotta in a guava soup. Perfect. My only complaint: the wine prices. They are, in a word, astronomical. I expect to pay double retail prices usually, maybe a bit more in Vegas, but Scarpetta is at least quadruple. So my husband chose beer, and I went with two glasses of wine and called it a day, rather than having to sell myself on the Strip for a bottle.",

(All the tables that actually had front view of the Bellagio water show could've cared less about the water show!) The view really is amazing. The ambiance is nice and romantic, with Justin Timberlake singing in the background. The bread baskets were as delicious as everyone mentioned, and if you ask they do give another basket. Ordered the spaghetti because everyone mentioned how great it was -- it was yummy but not sure $24 yummy. Ordered a bottle of wine which was a task because they had so many options! Service was great and it was a nice fine dining experience.",

I have to mention that the music was perfect. It was swanky downtempo electronic music. Awesome.   I love beef tartars...especially the korean/japanese yuk-hoe, so as an appetizer, I decided to order the Wagyu Beef Tartare and for dinner I ordered the famous Duck Foie Gras Ravioli.  The server brought out an assortments of bread to soothe my appetite. There was sourdough, french bread, rosemary bread, and stromboli. The bread came with a trio of butter, tomato-herb salad, and a lime-infused olive oil. The stromboli was the bomb.  The beef tartar came out next and I was extremely underwhelmed by it. The meat lacked flavor and the side salad was too salty. There is also a cured egg in it, which I did not taste at all. I did like the hazelnut garnish tho. All in all, 2/5 stars for this dish.   Finally, the duck foie gras ravioli came out and it did not disappoint. They were small pockets of ravioli stuffed with a mixture of duck liver and duck confit, all topped with balsamic vineger and scallions. The pasta was fresh and incredibly delicate. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. My only knock on it was that I was not full at all. 4.5/5 stars.",

Terrific view.  The bread basket was great, but the stromboli bread full of meat and cheese was amazing.  Worth it just for that.  Wife started with the creamy polenta - 5 hour cooked polenta with mushroom and truffle sauce, each served in their own pot, whilst the sauce is meant to be spooned over the polenta.  Very good, not as truffly as we both expected.  I got a very pretty beet salad with homemade mozzarella.  Agnolotti and spaghetti for our Primi courses.  As good as the other reviews say.  Extremely rich.  Black Cod for Secondi that was not quite as memorable as the pasta or bread.  Could have skipped this.  Highly recommend.  Best service, best ambiance of our stay.",

The scallop was pretty good, the foie gras ravioli was ok, we had a steak dish that I can't remember because it was that forgetful. finished it off with gelato, which I could have cared less about. The service was great, the decor was nice but boring. In general I was extremely underwhelmed. If my bill would have been about 50 dollars cheaper I would say this is a good place to take a friend or business partner, but not a date or someone who you'd want to share a meaningful or memorable evening with. However, since Scarpetta was not 50 dollars cheaper, my conclusion is... go somewhere else. There are much better places.",

It was perfect. Service was good, water was constantly filled, plates taken away and made sure we were doing okay. Food was so-so... yes, I said it... it was just okay. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli and the bf had the short rib agnolotti. I actually enjoyed his dish more than my own.. but both pastas were only okay. Somewhat lacked flavor, or I just might be more of a tomato sauce kind of girl. I did however enjoy their assortment of bread and the butter, and other dipping sauces they had. That was delicious and we had to have two servings of that. We also had a Caesar salad which was delicious and had a hint of lemon flavor that was refreshing.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was lovely. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated and feels warm and intimate. The background music was kind of random as it felt like Frank Sinatra or some jazz music should have been playing.  I am going to start with the food because that is whats really important, isn't it?? The breads are a lovely way to begin the meal especially because they offer a variety of dips and breads. The citrus infused olive oil was divine as was the extra soft butter. The salami and cheese stuffed bread looked amazing but I don't eat meat so my husband was able to eat 2 pieces to himself. He said it tasted as good as it looked.   The menu is small but offers some great choices. We started with the beet salad and a root vegetable soup. Both were excellent and the presentations were beautiful. For our main courses, we had the lobster pasta dish and the cheese agnolotti with a truffle butter sauce. I loved the agnolotti - it was a simple dish that didn't have to try to be anything else. Butter + truffles = love. My husbands dish had generous chunks of lobster, a delicious sauce, and perfectly prepared handmade pasta. We were in foodie heaven with every bite. We were sorry we didn't get dessert but we were so full so only ordered coffee.   If this review was for food alone, I would give it 5 stars but here are some of the reasons why I wont give this restaurant a 5 star review:   The service was only OK.  It wasn't over the top as one would expect from this type of establishment. Our waiter was pleasant but did not  go over anything on the menu. I am sure other diners had a better experience b/c we heard him talking away with the table next to us. It was strange b/c he did not offer one recommendation to us nor did he talk about any of the dishes or how they were prepared.   The didn't \"sweep\" the table between dishes. Normally things like this don't bother me but we had bread crumbs on the table and when you are eating at an expensive restaurant you are paying for food and overall dining experience.  Which brings me to one more gripe, they didn't offer any extras like other expensive restaurants typically do. There was no Amuse Bouche (yes this is a French thing) but places like Tom Colicchio's Craft gives you a tasting to start with in addition to your breads.   Overall: I would like to give this place 4 stars b/c the food was excellent but for the price and reputation, I was expecting a better dining experience. I am wondering if the Beverly Hills Scarpetta would be better?",

The food here is marginal and the prices exorbitant than its actually worth. I got the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was ok but not quite flavorful. After trying cucina enoteca in Irvine, CA, I always have to compare every italian place to it and Scarpetta cannot compete. Cucina Enoteca is always a good half price cheaper!   I also am NOT a fan of their service. My wine was forgotten and only came at the tail end of my dinner. For $18 a glass, this is unacceptable. I know waiters work long hours but it seem like everyone was crabby who worked there.  I'll have to say though, the window view is pretty good as it faces the fountain of the Bellagio.",

    "text": "Hidden on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan, Scarpetta is the place to visit to learn what really good pasta can be like.  As a pasta fiend, I am very picky when it comes to pasta.  Scarpetta has shown me another dimension to pasta that I must learn.  The minimalist approach where pasta is the star, and the sauce or other items are addendums.  Allow me to expound:  Signature Spaghetti: Normally a staple of the American diet, lifted from Italy, it is most commonly served with tomato, carbonara, or meat sauce. Since I make spaghetti at home, I always believed in what I thought I liked.  This dish showed me that a very simple, light sauce can accompany the pasta and \"show it off\" in a way that the pasta shines above the sauce.  A large portion is not required as the fresh pasta is rich and heavy.  The sauce is light, and delicately flavorful, allowing the pasta flavor to come out instead of being more of a \"texture\" experience.  When presented with this dish, one might think \"Where is the sauce?\", but when finished the response will be: \"I didn't miss it\"  Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli:  Again, simple in presentation and execution, the difference is in the details.  I normally don't like duck, and find foie gras to be overly rich and intense when served alone.  The blended filling, in just the right proportion to pasta was a grand pleasure and I will be looking or ANY excuse to have this dish again.  Again, the sauce is minimal at best and the dish relies on the pasta and filling almost entirely to achieve its goal.  Lesson Learned: Extravagant sauces are used to cover up mediocre pasta offerings  Appetizer Bonus: Creamy Polenta with Fricassee of Mushroom: This dish, served in a moderately small portion was a flavor and texture experience that reinforces the axiom that quality is small amounts is the most flavorful, and healthy for you experience.  Having watched its manufacture on the Food Channel, the secret is in the long prep.  Like tamahagane, it must be nurtured for hours (3) to achieve the complete assimilation of the polenta kernel into the dish, resulting in a creaminess of exceptional quality.  All in all, I learned the perception of the Minimalist, the discipline of the Stalwart, and the reminder that food is art in the presentation.  My most basic position:  I will look for ANY excuse to visit Scarpetta in the future.  Sundries:  As with any restaurant of this caliber, service was impeccable.  Even though I dined alone on several occasions, several people inquired as to my satisfaction each visit.  I cannot say enough.  As a lone diner, I felt as attended to as any other party and normally I can't stand eating alone as one tends to get treated like a pariah.  Not the case here!",

    "text": "This review is actually about an experience i had on Valentines day. First of all, i made the reservations over a week in advance, After reading all of the reviews here, I requested to be sat next to the windows to see the fountains. Upon arriving there, they sat us in the 2nd row from the window. I asked about it and they said it was 'first come first serve', even though i had requested it in my reservations. Luckily, the couple next to us heard and switched us seats because they had already eaten there before and seen the view. It was really sweet of the couple. We actually had to wait for our menu, even though we had already sat down, which was really weird. It took maybe 10 minutes or so for them to give us menus.   We ordered the yellowtail appetizer. For entrees, I ended up ordering the short rib agnolotti and my boyfriend ordered the chicken with a side of brussel sprouts.  The yellowtail was so so, the fish was fresh but it didn't really have enough umph. The bread course was AMAZING. They had mascarpone butter, citrus oil and an olive tapenade that was to die for. i wasn't crazy about the agnolotti...I was actually pretty disappointed. There no actual sauce to the pasta, which for me was a misstep. Short rib and marrow are in nature very rich and oily but when i had it for leftovers, the oil was excessive to the point of it being disgusting. The brussel sprouts were the star of the night for me. Side dishes aren't usually that special but i could eat an entire bucket of these things if someone let me. I liked the chicken my boyfriend had but he didn't care for it. We ended the night with the nutella and vanilla bombolis and those were super delicious.  All in all, i think i would go again, but i would definitely order different things. I know he's known for his spaghetti and i totally regret to getting that.",

We had the following:  Corn soup with King crab fritters $19  Short Rib Agnolotti $26  Alaskan Halibut $40  Coconut Souffle $15  When we arrived at the restaurant, we waited about 20 minutes on a Thursday with reservation. We could see it was extremely busy which made me really excited to try Scott Conant's food. When we were seated, we were surprised to see what an awesome view of the Strip the resto had. As far as the food, it was pretty good. My wife said she loved the corn soup as it was not too sweet and they actually left some kernels in the soup to give it a texture contrast. The agnolotti was good. It was quite a rick tasting dish so maybe next time I'll ask for a lemon to squeeze on it or something. The halibut was a good dish after the pasta as it tasted very healthy with the vegetable broth surrounding the fish. The coconut souffle was awesome! It goes on my top 5 dessert list in vegas for sure. The service was great. We were seen by our waiter numerous times and our water was always filled. The only thing I would say negative was that the pasta was a little saturated in butter too much for my liking. Overall, I would scarpetta is a good romantic resto if you're looking for upscale italian food.",

Had a very nice refreshing wine from Cake Bread which went well with our meal.  I gave this place a 3 stars only because the food was ok.. it was good.. but not great.  Perhaps I was expecting it to be a bit better based on the previous reviews from other yelpers (ie. going in with too high expectations).  Don't get me wrong, it was a nice dinner.  Just not as great as what I anticipated it to be..  Don't think I would go back as there are plenty of other great restaurants in Vegas for italian.  Peace out..",

We were not allowed in the main dining hall due to a friend's attire (he had just got out of Marquee, their pool club).  I don't even fine italian food very often, but color me happy here.  The bread basket was awesome!  They had a salami bread in there... ask for extra :)  The olive tapenade they served it with was also stellar.  I could eat that stuff alone.  Ordered the duck + foie gras ravioli.  It was really good.  Friends ordered the spaghetti due to some rave reviews from my friend who had been here before.  I thought the spaghetti was good, but not $25 good.  The duck+foie gras ravioli was possibly worth the $27 they charged for it.  We sat in the lounge, so maybe didn't get the full dining experience, so charging the full dining room price for lounge food knocked the experience down some.   Almost a 5 star place imo.",

    "text": "The past few times my husband and I have been to Vegas we've gone to Scarpetta for the Social Hour. The food/drinks were always yummy and I have a bit of a love affair going on with the potato chips they set out at the bar. So for this Vegas trip we decided to make a reservation to do the tasting menu. We made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night (9/30/16).   We arrived, were seated promptly, but were then left for quite awhile before the waiter came over to talk to us. I mentioned that we wanted to do the tasting menu and was informed that they don't typically do it on weekends (the website specifies that the tasting menu isn't served after 10 pm and that it must be enjoyed by the whole table, but nowhere does it say that it's not available on weekends). The waiter could see that we were disappointed so said he'd ask the kitchen. He came back a bit later and said that kitchen said it was fine, tasting menu a-go. Great! We also did the wine pairing.   The food: - Ok, I know you shouldn't fill up on a bread basket when you are about to do a tasting menu, but oh my god. The sourdough and the stromboli's were our favorite.  - The first course was a duo of yellowtail and tuna that was their take on sushi. Two wonderful bites, perfect.  - The second course was a sea scallop with corn and homemade pancetta. The sea scallop and corn were amazing. The piece of pancetta was essentially inedible because it was so incredibly overly salted (and I like salt!). It's the closest I've ever come to spitting food into my napkin. Instead, I just drank an entire glass of water.  - It's not on the tasting menu, but they brought out an order of the polenta and mushrooms for us compliments of the chef. It was absolutely heavenly. We both kept saying we shouldn't eat all of it because we needed room for the whole meal, but it was just that good.  - Next was the pasta course. The famous spaghetti and the short rib agnolotti. We'd had the agnolotti before during Social Hour and loved it. We were anxious to try to spaghetti after having heard so many great things about it. It was truly wonderful. Both are flawless dishes; pasta is clearly Scott Conant's specialty. When we finished this course we both looked at each other and said we'd be happy to end dinner with that.  - Next was fennel dusted black cod. I wasn't a fan of this dish. It was too \"fishy\" for my taste, but it was my first time having black cod so I assumed I just wasn't a fan of the protein. My husband enjoyed his but ate about half as he was getting full. I should've tried his fish as he said he didn't find it overly fishy (whereas I described my piece as licking a rotting fish corpse); but, alas, I didn't. I will say, the vegetables on this plate were amazing. - Next was duck breast. I was so excited because duck is one of my favorite things to eat. This duck was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't great. It was a tad overcooked and it didn't have the best sear on it. The flavors of the dish were great, the duck just could've been cooked better -Finally, dessert. We were absolutely stuffed but dessert was just so good, an amazing chocolate cake and gelato.   The wine: - All I can say about the wine pairing was that each and every wine was perfect for the course and delicious. I would give the wine pairing 5 stars.   Overall it was a great meal; but, it was just too much food. We've done a variety of tasting menus (including at e by Jose in cosmo) and this was the only one where we felt the amount of food was overwhelming. It probably has less to do with the total amount of food, as it does with there being 2 pasta courses and us having polenta.   I would've rated our previous dining experiences at Scarpetta at the Social Hour as 5 star. I would have rated this meal as 4 star (simply because of technical flaws with the pancetta and duck breast, and slightly slow service). BUT....after we left the restaurant we started walking back to our room (in Cosmo) to change clothing before going back out. Walking down the 3rd floor hallway to the room elevators I all the sudden felt horrible. Luckily I didn't have to walk too far before finding a restroom, where I began suffering from extremely violent food poisoning. That lasted all night and into the next day. My husband was completely fine. I suspect the black cod (I'm fairly certain the issue came from Scarpetta since for breakfast/lunch we'd split dishes at other places).   TLRD: 3 star review because while the food was amazing, the food poisoning was awful",

    "text": "Simply Amazing.  There is a very tough choice when dining at the Cosmo because they have amazing offerings.  Scarpetta is one of those choices that I believe is a must.  The ambiance is very nice, and if you get there at a good time, you can request a table by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains for some dinner entertainment.  There were 7 of us in my party, so I got to try quite a few things.  Service was on par with any high end restaurant which is good.  Bread - They give you four variations of bread, all good.  The standout is the Stromboli.  The bread comes with three dips which are Eggplant, Olive Oil with Lime and Marscapone Butter.  The eggplant dip was amazing.  Steak Tartar - This dish was fabulous and is my main recommendation for appetizer.  It is perfectly seasoned and finished off with a tiny quail egg on top. The toast points are also seasoned, buttered and toasted to add that buttery nutty flavor to the bite.  Fried Lemon Grass and Char - This dish was unique.  It was little strands tempura-like fried bits of lemon grass and fish mixed together.  I said Char because I believe that is what it was, but I cannot be for certain.  It was very simple and very good but I could take it or leave it for the price.  Scallops - Careful with this dish as you only get two.  I understand they are a luxury type item but for 21$ or how much ever it was, two scallops did not go a long way.  They were your average good scallop.  Foie Gras & Duck Ravioli - The star of the night.  This dish was simply perfect.  From flavor balance, quantity of food, to execution...it was a hit.  If you come here and don't at least try it, you are missing out.  Filet - The filet was cook medium rare (which is the way I like it) and was very soft as it should be.  That being said, it was a filet.  A normal good filet that you can get from any great steakhouse.  The star of that dish was actually the accompanying potatoes.  Mashed with garlic, sauteed spinach, sun dried tomatoes and a cheese that I could not recognize.  Chicken - OK yes, someone ordered chicken.   The one dish everyone always passes over at restaurants because...well, its chicken.  That being said, I was given about a fourth of the chicken because they were full and I must admit.  It was tasty as hell.  The skin is cooked on it to make it very crispy with seasonings that go a long way.  The bird itself was moist so that you had to use hardly any effort for it to shred apart in your mouth.  If I ever ordered chicken in a restaurant, this would be the one.  Its also a HUGE portion in terms of high end restaurant portions.  I would go back here in a heart beat.",

While on another trip to the sin city;) my bf and I chose to celebrate our 3 years anniversary at this restaurant after many yelping, looking for the perfect spot for this occasion . We set at the bar area and arrived just in time for happy hour, which means we could enjoy multiple dishes and cocktails at a very reasonable price. We orders almost the entire happy hour appetizer menu, as well as another main course from the regular menu, and were taken by every single dish. Started with burrata crostini, short rib agnolotti (which we later ordered again since it was so phenomenal), the sea food dish, creamy polenta and the Tagliatelle fall vegetables, truffle zabagalione & guanciale. We finished with the most amazing Nutella mini donuts- to die for!!! Our bar tender was ok, not very verbal, but it didn't matter since we enjoyed each other's company and the food was amazing!

Thousands of people were descending on Cosmo's P3 restaurant zone all at once, and I had to select a dinner spot as quickly as possible, or else no open seats would be left.  Scarpetta was the ideal choice, since I could squeeze in at the bar.  The place was a madhouse, but I didn't mind.  Service at the bar was just as spot-on as in the dining room.  I was also luckily enough to be seated next to some very friendly and sociable solo diners who *love* talking about food.  I started off with a glass of Riesling, which I sipped while nibbling on some freshly baked bread.  Scarpetta serves one of the finest breadbaskets in Vegas, with abundant olive oil, eggplant tapanade, and whipped mascarpone cheese for spreading.  For my app, I tried the braised beef short rib with farro risotto and a slice of lardo.  Ladies and gentlemen -- you will never taste short rib as tender and delicate as this.  Absolutely perfect.  For my entree, I tried the spaghetti, which is apparently a specialty of the house -- and I can totally see why.  Thick, plump noodles with a smooth and flavorful sauce will totally upend any preconceived notions of what spaghetti should taste like.  You think spaghetti is simple or boring?  Not after Scott Conant has his way with it.    There are so many fabulous restaurants in the Cosmo that picking a single favorite is close to impossible...but Scarpetta is definitely high on the list!",

    "text": "I have been dying to try this restaurant for a while, hearing all About their special  spaghetti really had me hyped. Of course as soon as I got a reason for a celebration I choose Scarpetta. It was honestly underwhelming. I was expecting the food to be out of this world but unfortunately it was lacking in flavors. I got their butternut squash soup with lobster to start with and found the flavors to be very odd paired together. They were not complimentary to each other. We also got a steak which was good. Short rib pasta was great as well. Although very greasy. The service was great as expected from a 5 star rated restaurant. I liked the atmosphere. It was modern and seductive. Sadly, with so many Italian restaurants in town Scarpetta will not be the first on my list to visit.",

However, the sommelier was pretty much of a con artist. Because there is a dining minimum, he sold us a very expensive (think $450) bottle of a white Burgundy which had almost no flavor at all.  (When he asked, we said we were disappointed, and he gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne, to be fair.) But beware!!!!!    We did have a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains and the kitchen.",

I mean from the service to the delectable food, we were really wowed.  We had a 6pm reservation (which is really early for Vegas) but arrived early and  said we will seat you at 6, but please enjoy a drink at the bar. It was very fancy! We were seated at 6 with an amazing view of the bellagio and fountains. Our server knew his stuff, and recommended the vegetarian pasta with a truffle cream sauce for me, and the New York steak for my husband. We also had the creamy polenta for an appetizer. Everything was amazing!! Oh and the complimentary bread was too!!! Thank you for showing this mom and dad of a toddler a good time Scarpetta!",

Dishes: Fois Gras and Duck pasta- ok but nothing special Short Rib Pasta- good but again, nothing special Spaghetti with tomato and basil- AMAZING, truly a signature dish, I wish I could have had 3 of these! Octopus app- tasty but I've had better (mainly B&B also in Vegas)  Desserts: Panna Cotta- I don't even love Coconut but this was AWESOME! fresh fruit yum Strawberry shortcake- deconstructed and so so very delicious  Nutella & Vanilla Bomboloni - AWESOME, highly recommended  The Spaghetti and desserts were the highlight of our meal. For Vegas, it wasn't a terribly expensive meal so we would go back for sure!",

    "text": "The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because the server or busser who ever was refilling my drink actually did what he was supposed to.  For an expensive, high class dinner.. we expected for them to at least make my cousin's husband birthday to be specially. Yaknow, the whole dessert with candle thing. We ordered so many dessert for crying out loud, they didn't really need to give us a free one. At least a candle ? THAT'S STRIKE ONE.  The second one is.. I got the duck liver pasta.. I expected to get checked on while eating dinner. Yeah, there were a lot of us.. but we also had TWO SERVERS!!! Didn't get asked at any point what so ever how I liked my food (it had no flavor by the way) so I had no choice, because of my hunger, but to bare that food rather than ask for a different one because there was no one to request it from. THAT'S STRIKE TWO Then the server, didn't tell us the last minute that they could only split checks in the beginning until we needed our checks in the end. In the freaking end!! THAT'S STRIKE THREE   OVERALL, mediocre food, service was okay, for an expensive price. You're pretty much paying for the name and location of they restaurant.. i suggest skip it and go to a neighboring restaurant instead.  Idk.. maybe it's different for everyone :( but I'm just not a big fan :( I'm a foodie. I love food adventure and food full of flavor. & I just didn't get that.. on the up side, Nutella dessert was great but nothing special",

The Twenty Bench Cab was delicious, and the Espresso Old Fashioned was spectacular. We ordered the Duck Foi Gras Ravioli, Short Rib Marrow Agnolotti, Creamy Polenta with Mushroom Ragu, and the Branzino. I feel like what I described is the food of the lower class 100 years ago. But sometimes, good, comfortable ingredients, prepared perfectly, and served by Roberto, who had a great personality and style, well... it is worth it.

    "text": "This will become one of my go-to Vegas restaurants! I read the reviews on the spaghetti and yes, it's probably the most unassuming this on the menu, but for sure the BEST spaghetti I've ever had!! It would be hard for me to order anything else on the menu, yet there are so many more things I want to try. And dessert. Get dessert. The Nutella and vanilla italian donuts were amazing. I could have eaten a plate of those for dinner. They have a very extensive wine list, but it is all pretty pricey for a bottle. A bottle of Oyster Bay Pinot Noir was $84. I don't mind paying for a good wine but Oyster Bay is far from worth $84. However, we did find a nice bottle for $115. But their wine list ranged from $84 to about $8000. So there is something for almost everyone.",

    "text": "I've been to Scarpetta in Beverly Hills and enjoyed the food there so I was delighted to see another location at the Cosmopolitan. I couldn't find any other review mentioning take out/to go orders and on Yelp, they're listed as not offering take out. The kids in our group really wanted pasta though so I thought I'd call to see if perhaps the information on Yelp was incorrect. They do in fact accept take out orders. The lady who answered my call informed me that she could take my order over the phone or I could come in and order at the bar.   Ordering was easy and I found the staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable. Scarpetta is known for their spaghetti; however, the regular spaghetti sauce does have dairy and the noodles have egg. They removed the cheese and subbed in gluten free noodles to accommodate the kids' allergies. I myself had the duck and foie gras ravioli. All of our orders were delicious and definitely comprised of quality ingredients. It took about a 10 minute wait to make our order.  I'm glad that they offer take out because they were the only restaurant in Cosmopolitan that readily noted that they offered gluten free options. From my past experience with Scarpetta, I know the restaurant itself isn't meant for kids. Therefore I appreciate that we could still enjoy great food in our hotel room and avoid potentially disrupting fellow patrons' dining experiences. Only caveat is that the serving sizes are on the smaller side - arguably not really a surprise for fine dining. The thirteen year old inhaled his serving of spaghetti and the two year old easily finished half of hers in one sitting.",

Here is the secret: Make a reservation during the early part of the week and order the sampler menu. The sampler is not available during the busy times (Fri-Sun). A word of caution: don't gorge on the bread or you will not be able to finish the meal. Sampler: $90 Wine compliment:$50. I don't remember the exact amounts.    If you drink wine, add the wine for each sampler. You will be very happy with their wine selection for EACH of the sampler.   Their signature spaghetti is the best I have ever had. There was one dish they cooked up specially for my wife from her previous visit with her BFFs.   This will be the first place we revisit when we head back to LV.",

You're given a bread bowl at the beginning of the meal with a nice array of breads with olive oil, butter, and an eggplant dipping sauce. The bread was amazing.   We started with the black tagliolini, a pasta with squid ink, crab, and fish roe.  It was a unique dish with a delicate flavor.  The roe provided little bursts of sweetness which complimented the crab nicely.   I had the Branzino, which was perfectly executed.  It was served with a saffron broth poured over it at the table.  Another beautiful dish with delicate flavors.  I do wish that some ellement of it had a bit more \"pop.\"  Overall a very nice meal.",

    "text": "Skip the primi, dive into the secondi.  Scarpetta excels at pasta.  While it is True, a recent trip to Italy has forever altered my perception of Italian food (the reason for the loss of a star), Scarpetta delivers with an Italian chic decor, light spirited service, contemporary plating, and Italian cooking sensibility.  Straight to the pastas.  Plated as a secondi (second course before the main), portions are smaller.  Do like the Italians, save your bread to mop up the left over sauce once you finish the pasta.  Trust me, do it, you'll understand.  The tagliatelle with a truffle zabaglione and guanciale, a take on carbonara is excellent.  All the flavor of carbonara are there, just lighter. The pasta is toothsome and near perfect.  Duck and foie ravioli.  Thin sheets of translucent pasta around packets of duck and melting foie.  Glazed with a sweet marsala and duck stock reduction.  The sauce is enriched with dribbles of foie fat as the little packets are broken open.  Finally, the spaghetti with tomato and basil is a take on amatriciana.  Simple, fresh pure of tomato, hint of fresh basil.  Clean flavor.  Although I'm happy with two or three pastas, most think I've gone foodie crazy so if you must, the  mains.  The spiced duck breast with endive, preserved orange, and cipollini onions is excellent.  Perfectly rendered, the skin of the rare duck is crisp with no cloying underlying raw fat.  It's earthy, ducky flavor cut by the sauce of preserved orange and duck jus creates a very well balanced dish.  Not to be outdone, the fennel spiced black cod.  Hints of licorice taint the delicate flavor of the cod, the acidity of tomatoes and the briny, salty flavor of olives elevate it.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find the mantecato of baccala the menu promised.  All good, the dish worked.  Great wine list.  Heavy emphasis on Italy.    Is Scarpetta truly Italian?  No.  (You should still tip your server; I miss Italy).  It does however, deliver a great experience.",

All the pastas were cooked properly al dente. We also had a side of broccoli rabe, which was garlicky and spicy.  Service was excellent. Interestingly, the interior was fancier than I expected.

The service team was attentive and friendly.  The bread basket is filled with tasty options.  For my meal I ordered the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  It was very good.  It also has brown butter, horseradish and bread crumbs as part of the meal.  The horseradish is very subtle, so do not get scared away by that.  The bone marrow helps give it deep flavor.  The meal is very good.  The portion is modest, so definitely consider an appetizer, soup or salad to pair with it.",

It was really what set the experience apart from lesser fine-dining options, as opposed to the food.  The duck/foie gras ravioli was definitely the star at our table. Two people ordered the spaghetti, which I tried. It was definitely tasty, but not hype-worthy.  Other dishes hit the table- the scallop and short rib appetizers are small, and the short rib wasn't amazing. I didn't try a scallop. I had the Jidori chicken (because I never order chicken and saw another review that insisted). Very good!  Recommended generally.",

The polenta with truffle was wow!   We had the short rib and spaghetti main courses and I would do it again. The broccoli was a little too bitter for me.  The wine menu is certainly one of the more inflated I have seen but we got a nice Groth for a little higher than going rate.  We couldn't get last minute reservations but could get a nice private booth in the lounge which was perfect and probably better than the main dining area. I would come back!",

    "text": "Scarpetta is awesome.  The food, the service, the location...I loved all of it.  Yes, it is over-priced, but all Vegas restaurants are over-priced, so in my mind it's all relative.  I go into it from the beginning expecting to pay more, but I also expect the restaurant to hold up its end of the bargain and give me something that doesn't make me regret spending $100 a person.  Scarpetta definitely holds up its end of the bargain here, and now that I've addressed the price issue, I can write about the more interesting things!  We tried the short ribs for appetizer and spaghetti and branzino for entrees.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth juicy good.  I've never had freshly made spaghetti before, and it was amazing...now I can confidently say that I really understand al dente!  The branzino, which I typically find simply prepared in other Italian restaurants, had a very creative and delicious preparation.  It came as two filets (with crispy skin!) on top of a hodge-podge of seafood (baby shrimp and mussels) with some kind of seafood jus that is added at the table (interesting pink color, but very nice seafood flavor).  The mascarpone butter and citrus olive oil that accompanies the bread is delicious!    I tried a couple of cocktails, and the one that stands out the most to me was the Gallardo.  I was hesitant to try it because it included apple juice (which I don't enjoy), but the waiter assured me it didn't taste too apple-juicy and he was right!  It was flavored mostly by the basil and was so aromatic and fresh...perfect accompaniment to spaghetti!  I think the most amazing part of the meal was the strawberry souffle.  I want to go back to Vegas just to have it again.  I can't even describe it.  Just get it and try different bites with the ice cream, rhubarb and the other sweet sauce it comes with...pure eating pleasure sensations.  We also had the bomboloni, which were very good, but at the end of the day just still  felt like donuts and weren't as special as some of the other items I tried.  As mentioned by many other reviewers here, the view over the Bellagio fountain is pretty sweet, and it is just so lovely right around sunset.  The interior ambiance of the restaurant is classy and fun.  On a side note, I am totally addicted to the show Chopped and love Scott Conant and was so happy his restaurant did not disappoint :)",

Net: Good service, nice ambiance, marginal food, outrageous cost. I've had fine dinners all over the world and this would rate on the bottom in terms of taste, portion, and quality. It would also rank as one of the most expensive. I ordered prime tartare--it was (no joke) 1 inch in diameter and virtually no taste. It cost $22! Our other guest ordered spaghetti and it was very average. There isn't a single bottle of wine under $100. This place is a complete rip off (we dropped $450 for four people) and not worth your hard-earned money. You can get better tasting food, better portions, and a fair price somewhere else. Stay away unless you prefer to throw your money away.",

However the yellowtail smelled and tasted funky and the tuna was ruined with truffle oil. The flavorless dishes kept rolling and the service was equally terrible.   We walked away feeling completely ripped off by a restaurant with an identity crisis. When i spend upwards of 300 on a meal, i expect good attentive service and good food. If a full plate goes back, i expect someone to notice and speak to us but no one cared at all.   For a guy like scott who is so critical on these cooking shows, you really should revisit your own house. There are just too many places in vegas for places like this to survive.",

    "text": "I had been dying to try Scarpetta for about a year and we finally got around to it this weekend. You walk up to the bar area which is a skinny hallway that eventually opens up into a beautiful large room. We lucked out and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was a really great view and so fun to watch. Our server greeted us right away and he had great suggestions and a good sense of humor, always a plus.    We started with the complimentary bread basket and it was super fantastic, possibly my favorite bread basket on the strip! There is a delicious stromboli bread filled with warm meat and cheese. There is also an herb bread, a nice piece of crusty bread, and a little cloud like square pillow of bread. There are also 3 spreads, an eggplant, a mascarpone buttery spread, and a citrus olive oil. I am not a fan of eggplant in general so I didn't try that one but I couldn't decide which of the other 2 I liked more. So yummy!  I started with the Heirloom beet salad. There was an array of different colored beets, 2 little wedges of la tur cheese, a few micro-greens, and some hazelnuts sprinkled throughout the plate. Everyone together was great, I just wish there was a bit more acid to break up the savoriness of the dish. I could only stomach half of it before it just became too rich, luckily my husband was happy to eat the other half.   I moved on to my entree, the short rib agnolotti. The pasta was so delicate and light. The horseradish brown butter had a little kick to it and overpowered the dish just a little. Again, I found this dish very savory and wasn't able to eat the entire plate. Again, my husband saved the day.   My husband ordered the turbot, it was delicate and so delicious with a light and airy crust. The little parsnips hidden under the fish were my favorite part of the dish, so well done. We also got a side of the broccoli Rabe, which was good but nothing special.   Our waiter talked us into dessert and we were so happy he did. We ordered the Nutella and vanilla creme Bombolini and can't recommend it enough. We received six little fried donuts filled with Nutella or vanilla creme with a yummy caramelized banana on the side. Everything worked so well together. It wasn't overly sweet, just a nice end to the meal.   Overall, we had a great meal with a great view! I would definitely go back, if only for the bread basket.",

The ambiance certainly did, the service was great, and the food certainly did at times.  We did the tasting menu.  And the bottom line is that we were very happy, but not as happy as we could possibly be.  The expectation was high, and so was the price...so at the price we really needed it to come through for a 5 star rating...it ended as a 4 or 4.5 star experience for us.  There were a few items that left us wanting.  The spaghetti was good, but not the best thing I ever ate good (pasta or tomato... either way it was just above average good.)    The spaghetti was simple and lacked anything to set it off as truly amazing--coming off above-average, but slightly flat.  Likewise we enjoyed the duck & foie gras ravioli, but not at the raved about level we hoped for. The raviolis were overly rich and lacking balance...we were vary happy to just have a small portion in the tasting menu.  Some of our favorites were black cod, branzino, yellowtail, and creamy polenta with fricassee of truffled mushrooms.  We were also happy with the bread basket...how can you not be though?...a bread basket that includes a stromboli of rolled with cheeses and salami...yes please!  We had an amazing seat overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.",

    "text": "This place is swanky/trendy so prepare to spend some serious $$. It overlooks the Bellagio fountains which is pretty cool.  The service is extremely well-trained and professional.  We started off not ordering drinks but felt kind of funny, almost like it was *expected* we order a cocktail. If you're concerned about the cost, just don't go here. We sucked it up and ordered 2 drinks (cocktail was $18, wine was $15).  We started with the raw tuna appetizer with caviar, granny smith apples and truffle crema. It was delicious. It comes with 4 pieces and because we split it, they put 2 each on separate plates which was a nice touch.  Also, to note, the bread basket is insanely good. They bring a few different types and serve it with citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone with sea salt and a tapenade.  I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. I did enjoy them but they were a little one note. Perhaps they could have been a little heavier handed with the balsamic drizzle for a more complex flavor? I also was pretty full at that point after eating half the bread basket. I did wrap the rest to go and they tasted really great heated the next day.  My bf had the $55 steak which he really enjoyed but didn't understand why it was worth $55. We finished the meal with the chocolate parfait since it was the only gluten free dessert option. It was fine. Pretty light and refreshing.  Overall we enjoyed our experience once we got over the $$ aspect. It cost $200 for 2 people. Definitely check this place out if you are gluten free since they have many GF options. Just ask your waiter for the GF menu when you're seated. They are very accommodating.",

Also, the prices are adequate! And my lemon drop was very strong. Hooray, alcohol!

    "text": "My sister asked me to find a good place to have pre-Christmas dinner with our Mom in Las Vegas and I actually found Scarpetta by searching for top rated restaurants near the strip with foie gras. Seriously. I need my foie gras.  With the recent foie gras ban in California keeping me from one of my favorite delicacies, I definitely wanted to have it if I was crossing state lines.  Scarpetta stuck out to me because it wasn't a French restaurant, but an Italian one, which is my Mom's favorite... and a great way for everyone to be happy.  Scarpetta was perfect. Situated in the new and beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, it has an amazing view of the Bellagio and definitely has that upscale \"we are dining somewhere really fancy\" vibe.  The server was really enthusiastic about the dishes and described them each eloquently (I read one person's review that found this annoying, but I thought it was great!) and helped with recommendations for what to order.  Starter:  POLENTA with Mushrooms. Oh. My God. To DIE FOR. Seriously.  Wow.  Best dish of the night and that's saying a lot because everything was great.  Mains:  Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - Obviously what I ordered and obviously I loved it.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Usually when you order ravioli you get like, 4, and are left being hungry, but not in this case. It was a generous portion.  I would have loved there to be more foie gras but that's just being greedy.  Fennel Spiced Black Cod - My mom ordered this and it was probably the least interesting thing that we had, but still delicious.  Black Tonarelli - My sister ordered this and it was also amazing, al dente, just as it should be.  It took about 10 minutes to come out after the rest of the dishes and they kept apologizing profusely for it and then sent out TWO free desserts to make up for it.  (FREE!) Desserts:  Mascarpone Cheesecake - lighter than your average cheesecake, which made me like it more.  Amaedi Chocolate Cake - like a lava cake, but better.. the perfect texture / consistency with hot melted chocolate inside... served with almond ice cream...  This was one of the best Italian meals I've ever had outside of Italy,  and I've tried all of those overrated high end Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. I was expecting much less, thinking this was a bit of a tourist trap that I was buying into for the evening. It ended up being so much more. I was so pleasantly surprised and happy with the experience. Also, no BS portion sizes.. these are hearty portions and you will leave full.  Definitely one of my top (if not the top) Italian restaurants outside Italy.  I just may need to go visit the Scarpetta in LA.",

We don't live in the area so the next time we were in town we made a reservation to return. Mark the manager apologized profusely when we arrived, he also checked on us several times. Our waiter was Roberto, he was flawless. It was night and day with the waiters. Our first waiter really left a bad taste. Roberto not only explained different foods and made recommendations but, gently encouraged us after we made our choice to a different item. He was right. He couldn't have been more spot on. He was very attentive. Ivan was his assistant and was very attentive as well. The food was a beautiful experience. We had the polenta, a must have, carpaccio, melt in your mouth. My husband originally wanted the rack of lamb, but Roberto encouraged him to try the lamb ragu instead. The pasta was freshly made and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a steak filet. After wanting another cut, Roberto encouraged me to try the filet. Spot on. I love Gallagher's, but, this was better. Don't tell anybody. The desserts were fabulous, the cheesecake was so yummy. Why not 5 stars? Because of the previous experience. Next time we come we will book with Roberto, he made the difference. If you make a reservation ask for Roberto for an epic meal.",

The citrus olive oil was amazing paired with the Stromboli!  Berry smash - this drink was very good  Yellowtail sashimi - 4 stars. rock salt used was unique and yellowtail was tender.    Signature Spaghetti dish -  5 stars. This dish was really incredible.  Delicious in it's simplicity.   The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce light yet flavorful.  I have not had anything like it before and I will be trying to recreate it at home.  Short rib agnolotti -  5 stars. This was excellent!  It has a very strong horse radish taste so you have got to really like horse radish!    Pici - 4 stars. This dish was very good.  The noodles are cooked al dente. A little too mu/ch so for my taste.  There was tons of lobster.  I enjoyed the lobster paired with the tarragon.  I do not normally like pesto but I really liked the chili pesto in this dish.    The restaurant is very nice however we were a party of 5 and were seated right by the exit sign and bus area.  It seems this restaurant is more suited for parties of 4 our less. as there is not a lot of seating for a larger party.",

It might not be fair as this place isn't equal to some of my 2 star reviews (it's probably better than most), but for the high price-tag....I think it's justified. The best part of my experience was my $20-a-glass wine. The $$ amount is to be expected in any nice place in Vegas, and I was happy that the wine was at least very good for the price (as they aren't always). Service was so slow, it took almost twenty minutes between being greeted and for the waiter to come back for drinks, and then the same wait from drinks to food and food to the check. We were on a tight schedule being on a work trip, so this was a little inconvenient. It wasn't even busy yet, either. For my food I split the Tagliatelle which I felt lacked in truffle flavor and their signature spaghetti dish which I felt lacked in overall flavor and should not be their signature dish. In general the food was not bad in any way, I just thought it was very expensive for what it was and for the lack of great service. Generally not a bad experience and I might be willing to give it another shot when back in town.",

The wine was fantastic, as was everything I ordered (read: tuna 'susci;' their special pasta of the day made with squid ink -- app. portion, if you please; and the branzino... WOW!) Didn't think I had any room for dessert... but made room for heaven when it came to the table -- the zeppole was all that... and then some.

    "text": "After a fantastic visit to the NY location four or five years ago, I was excited to eat at Scarpetta again. Unfortunately our experience at the Vegas location was a huge disappointment. The food was still delicious, but it was completely eclipsed by the terrible service we received, and we left with a bad taste in our mouths despite that scrumptious pomodoro. Our surly server wore a perpetual scowl, avoided our eyes when we tried to flag him down, and seemed eager to flee the table as soon as he unceremoniously dumped our food down, without waiting to see if we needed anything else. You would think he didn't WANT us to order more cocktails or courses. Getting a basket of that delicious bread proved extremely difficult, let alone a second one. Worst of all, towards the end of our meal, three of us had finished our entrees, but two of us were still eating our shared pasta, when the servers started clearing plates, including said hard-won bread basket. They literally cleared every plate from a six-top except the one we were eating from. WHAT?! No. Unacceptable. Rule no. 1. Do not clear until everyone has finished eating! I cringed for the waiter but I was also very disappointed and shocked to experience this kind of service at a high end, expensive restaurant. Needless to say we felt rushed out and couldn't savor the last bites of our meal because everyone else at the now empty table was sitting there twiddling their thumbs. Going to a nice restaurant isn't just about the food - it's about the service, atmosphere, and overall experience. This is True everywhere but especially in Vegas. Scarpetta failed miserably on this front.",

I dined at B&B the night before, and was disappointed that they pointed me towards the veggie sides to make my 'entree'.  Scarpetta has a whole menu dedicated to vegetarians - a touch especially appreciated on the Strip.  I booked on OpenTable, specifying that I was veg and that we had a 7pm show to get to (the restaurant opens at 5:30pm).  They had us in and out at lightening speed, and the food was fantastic. Do not miss the mushroom polenta - truffles, vegetable stock, creamy polenta.. the dish is fantastic.  The sommelier made excellent recommendations based off of our meal choices.   My meat-eating Dad LOVED the salami bread. I was even more enamored by the fact they brought out a separate (meat-free) basket for me to indulge on.  Best meal in Vegas, with fabulous service to boot. It doesn't hurt that you have a great view of the Bellagio water fountains, either.",

I'm always on the road and I'm never in one place for so long because of my job so a mini vacay was way overdue! My first stop was the cosmopolitan, I've been here a couple of times and I love the vibe coming from the casino, it has marquee which is one of the hot spots in Las Vegas to date, a good amount of shopping stores and let's not forget the restaurants. To name a few you have Blue Ribbon Sushi, China Poblano, Comme Ca, Milos, STK, Holsteins and Scarpetta/DOCG. I've been to some of these restaurants before and Scarpetta \"WAS\" my favorite, the food is still on the top of my list but this time around the customer service was beyond horrible, the worst I've had in my entire life! I came to Scarpetta last year in mid-January 2011, this time they have new employees/managers. I walk to the host stand to check in and no one was there so I waited, then when this young lady arrived she checked me in but had a hard time working her own computer, finally when she gave me the OK can you wait at the bar it'll take just 5 to 10 minutes for your table, I said that's fine even though it wasn't busy. 10 minutes have passed and still no call for my name, finally I reminded the hostess and she goes \"oh yes your table was ready 5 minutes ago\". Instead of checking on the guest this airhead young school girl flirts with the bar back showing off her big breast, while the female manager just stands there letting her go on with her actions. I then tried to speak to the female manager and she turns away like she didn't even hear me. I finally sat on my chair to calm down, I then order my favorite the \"SPAGHETTI w/tomato & basil\", now I have explained to you guys before how this dish is. Scott Conant really put his all into this dish, his ingredients, the flavors, the texture of the pasta everything just works and I can't get enough of it! At the end of the night I did get up off my chair a happy person and the server was awesome but I did NOT leave the restaurant a happy guest, as I walked out to say thank you for the food the female manager again disappoints me. No words, no gratitude she looks at me like my money wasn't good enough, like I wasn't good enough for that place. I was told there's only one female manager so you'll know who I'm talking about when you get there. I swear this lady should get an award for being so stuck up and the worst manager ever! What happened to the old managers? Scott do yourself a favor and fire this woman, she's making your business look bad and as for the female manager, sweetheart you should relax and smile more! I definitely won't be coming back to this location or recommend this to anyone, if you really like the food just have it to go or else you'll feel like an unwelcome guest.",

    "text": "Warning, this beautiful restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan which is a pretentious somewhat tacky casino/hotel. Except for the hostess, who seemed a little  \"too cool\" for the guests, the staff gets an A+ for service. Titus was our main waiter but there were two other gentlemen who were on the spot and very kind.  We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains as well. The warm bread basket with a variety of breads (foccacia, stromboli, etc) was served with a 3 different types of dips (an eggplant thing, olive oil, and butter) and they were all so delicious. We started our meals with a shared Beet salad and polenta. To say the polenta was AMAZING would not give it enough credit. It was creamy and consistent, topped with truffled mushrooms, garlic, and sauce. The serving was large enough to share. I could have had another serving of the polenta and been quite happy and full. The beet salad was crisp and came with a generous serving of gooey cheese (stracciatella), pumpkin seeds and balsamic dressing.  It was fresh and tasty.  My friend and I shared the Duck and foie Gras Ravioli and Short Rib Agnolotti. My friend loved the Ravioli and loved the marsala reduction. I felt the duck and foie gras had a weird texture and I didn't care much for it. But that could have been a mental thing since I have opinions about foie gras practices. The sauce was delicious however and perfect for dipping some bread into. I wasn't sure what to expect with the Short Rib. It was small rib pieces in noodle wrapping covered with breadcrumbs (?), brown butter and horseradish. Whoa the horseradish was strong but so delicious! If I hadn't filled up with polenta and bread, I could have finished my plate. It was so delicious. But if you find horseradish to be strong or can only tolerate a little, skip this meal! There wasn't any room for the dessert. But the options looked tempting. Oh I forgot we had Moscato de' Asti that complimented the meal throughout. The price seemed fair for the quality and service. One of the most delicious meals I have ever had.",

The Vegas version has a great location in the Cosmo, but the food and service didn't quite knock my socks off like the genuine article. Try the fritto misto and spaghetti with tomato and basil for a great taste of Italy, but if you want to experience what Scarpetta can really deliver you have to go to NYC!! Definitely worth a shot if you're rich and hungry for Italian lol..",

Our waiter Roberto was patient with us as we were so busy catching up we took a long time to look at the menu and order. Service was on point, professional, friendly, informative and unobtrusive. Every dish we tried was amazing! My favorites were the buratta salad and truffle sheep milk ravioli! My friends were speechless when they tried the short ribs with farro. The wine sommelier Paulo was very attentive and fun to talk to. Managers Mario and Kelly both stopped by the table to check on us and make sure every thing was perfect- which it was. Save room for dessert! The cheesecake was the best I have ever had! Highly recommend Scarpetto and can't wait to go back!",

The bread didn't come out until the appetizers which is a huge pet peeve, but whatever.  The big problem was the portion size.  My tiny little turbot cost $38.  My husband's chicken was half a breast at best.  $250 later, we ended up going to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo for a slice after our dinner at Scarpetta.  Secret Pizza, on the other hand, I highly recommend.",

First, wine is very expensive; $75 for the least expensive bottle. Second, the food was luke warm. Third, the restaurant was empty yet we were sat in the center of the room pushed up against a pole. Honestly... I was really excited about this place, and it was a complete let down. I guess this place has a nice view.... I wouldn't know because I was sat at the worst table in the restaurant, even tho it was empty. Out of the 4 entrees we ordered, one was excellent, and the other 3 were forgettable. For the money I spent, I was hoping for something I could tell people about. I won't mentioning this place to anyone.",

The meal started with their freshly baked bread and spreads which were divine. We started with the beef tartare and the polenta. Tartare, very fresh. The polenta, honestly, some of the best I've had. So cheesy!! I would come back for this dish alone! For my entree, I got the pasta with lobster. The dish, when brought out I thought was on the small side, but once I took a bite, I understood why. Extremely rich. A little too rich for my tastebuds. I actually couldn't finish it, which doesn't happen often. Delicious, but just too rich. Dessert, we ordered the bombolini that were filled with either vanilla or chocolate filling. Highly recommend these. Also ordered the chocolate cake, good, but I'm not the biggest chocolate cake fan. My brother-in-law who loves chocolate loved the cake.   Good service and food with gorgeous views.",

Here's the cool part, the bartender that checked our ID saw that it was my girlfriend's birthday (we were there for her birthday), and of course he acknowledged but when they came out with the dessert it said \"Happy Birthday\" on it! He also treated us with a little taste of some dessert liquor! What a great way to top off a great night!

    "text": "Wow!  First time to a Scott Conant restaurant on 12.8.16. Walked in ready for the signature spaghetti and excited for the bread based on the reviews. Other guests wanted the tasting menu, sure!  I'm super glad we went with this. We got to try so many amazing dishes. I admit I couldn't move after dinner, and that doesn't happen often, but it was well worth it!!!  Others got the wine pairing and thought it was awesome.   1. Start with the bread. Maybe the best bread basket I've had.  The salami and cheese bread was delicious. I could've just had that for my meal.  2. Duo of yellowtail and tuna. Raw fish is not my favorite but I cleared the plate. This was delish. There was so much flavor. It was light and clean and tasty.  Yellowtail had pocketed red onion.  Tuna had avocado crema, pickled peppers, Granny Smith apples, and crispy quinoa.  3. Fritto. I do wanted to try this and we got a bonus dish!  It was delicious. There was even lightly fried lemons with the veggies and seafood.  4. The diver scallops was tender and delish with the mushrooms and blood orange.  5. The polenta was another off menu bonus. So many people loved this, so happy I got to try it. Mixed with truffles, it was good.  6. Spaghetti. Tomato & basil. I ate it all. It was as good as I hoped.  7. Short rib agnolotti. A star. Very tender short rib. Very rich.  Brown butter. Horseradish. Toasted breadcrumbs.  8. Fennel dusted black cod. I ate it all. Asparagus. Mushroom. Enough said.  9. Spiced duck breast. I don't eat a lot of duck but this was good.  10. We got the coconut souffle instead of the chocolate cake. It was a late change and the souffle was very liquid. Not sure if this is normal or not. It was good but I prefer it more cakey. Lemongrass gelato was good too. Note they did up charge for this.  $5 when on menu it's $4 more.  My fav were the duo of yellowtail and tuna, spaghetti, fritto, and the bread basket!!!  Service was good.   Wow. There was a view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner. That was amazing too!  I'm full just thinking about this meal. Highly recommend!",

We have a second home in LV so we have some regular restaurants we like to hit. However, last night's experience made me want to look for an alternative Italian restaurant.  On previous occasions to Scarpetta, the food and  service were excellent. They even accommodated my son by making an off-menu cacio pepe (a standard for any Italian). But not last night. The waiter had no clue what cacio pepe was (ok) but did not even try to get the name to ask the kitchen (which I'm sure, would have known what it was). My husband ordered their last risotto with black truffles (which I believe was $165 a plate or something similar) and requested that the truffles be shaven on our son's pasta instead (he LOVES truffles). But that didn't happen either. When you're paying that much for a dish, do what the customer asks!",

This was my first time being introduced to a Scott Conant restaurant and was certainly not disappointed. I can't even tell you how many dishes we ordered but we had to go big! Black tagliolini, prime filet, veal chop, duck and foie Gras ravioli, mushrooms, broccolini, polenta and of course the spaghetti.   To be completely honest with you the dishes were all solid. Nothing wrong with any of them. HOWEVER, the humble spaghetti, boring as it may look and sound, stole the show entirely. It was so good it made me regret ordering the tagliolini and all the apps when I could've gotten two of the spaghettis!   If you come on a date night I highly recommend each of you ordering another main and then ordering the spaghetti to share so you can get a good variety of dishes while also being able to enjoy Scarpetta's best dish.",

Very sophisticated decor.  Service (Luis) was very good. He seemed very passionate about food choices and pairings.   Very knowledgeable and personable.    Their bread is served with  a nice trio of sauces.  We started with  beef carpaccio app.  Really good.  The combination they add on top really make it.  For entrees I had the octopus and shrimp risotto.  A bit of a kick to it so you won't have to add salt or pepper.  Great dish.   Wife had the cod.  Really creative presentation and she left her plate clean.  I do wish they had more wine selections by the glass.  Also, most of the meat dishes were really pricey.    Nice night at Scarpetta..

We would go back there just for the agnolotti.   The Duck and Foie ravioli, while well made, felt like a let down compared to the agnolotti. The foie, rather than adding buttery richness to the ravioli, accentuated the gamey-ness and tasted more like regular liver.   We also got the Arancini and the Fritto Misto. The arancini was pretty standard. The fritto misto comes out as a pile of thinly sliced fried vegetables on some small bits of assorted fried seafood. There was a tiny subtle pleasant kick to the fritto misto that also added to the uniqueness of the dish.",

    "text": "I have to say, our experience at Scarpetta was one of the best fine dining experiences that I've had in Vegas yet, and I've been to a good amount of restaurants on the Strip!  I had made a reservation for Sunday night at 6:30pm through Open Table, but had cancelled it because we weren't quite sure where we wanted to eat for sure yet. I saw that there were still a few time slots for around 6pm left on Open Table, so I didn't bother to make another appointment when we decided to just go there.   We showed up around 6:15pm and asked to be seated in the dining room. The hostess told us that all the tables are booked and that we need a reservation. I kindly told her that I had a reservation, but cancelled it because I saw that there were still many time slots left. She just looked at me and started walking us to a table. (This was kind of strange haha).  The bread that was given to start was amazing. There were 5 different kinds of bread and 3 sauces: citrus olive oil, eggplant tapenade and mascarpone cheese butter. I had to get two orders of the eggplant tapenade...so good.  Our server Roberto was extremely helpful with helping us looking over the menu and to order.   For our appetizer we ordered the Mediterranean Octopus which was very tender. For our pasta we ordered the famous Tomato and Basil Spaghetti. It was cooked perfectly al dente. I would have to say it was the best spaghetti that I've ever had. I'm pretty much drooling thinking about it right now..  For our entrees I ordered the Fennel Dusted Black Cod and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. He had ordered medium rare, but they served it to him as medium well. I told him to tell our one of the employees (Julio) to send it back. Julio was very accommodating and made sure that my boyfriend received the second steak cooked perfectly the way he wanted.   Roberto even included a Coconut Panna Cotta on the house for dessert because of their mistake with the steak. It was so good!!  I just wanted to give a big shout out to Roberto and Julio for making our first time experience at Scarpetta amazing, even if we had to send back my boyfriend's steak. The Tomato Basil Spaghetti was the highlight dish of the night. We will surely return to Scarpetta whenever we are in Vegas again!",

    "text": "Full disclosure- one of the employees treated me to dinner here, so I was able to sample more dishes than I might normally. And I must say, I am SO glad that I did! This may rate as one of the best meals I've had in 2015.  Scarpetta is a beautiful, dimly lit restaurant in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We opted to dine in the lounge, so I wasn't able to see much of the decor, but from what I did see, it was comfortable and elegant.  Service was top notch. All of the servers were knowledgable and friendly, and the presentation was lovely.  Of course, I cannot remember the official names of all of the dishes, so I will just touch on some of the highlights.   The octopus appetizer- delicious. Warm, tender, not too chewy, served with olives and tomatoes.   The scallops- one of my favorite seafoods, and it was definitely done justice. The little pieces of meat in the dish were an awesome surprise, and the scallops were cooked perfectly. They were served over white beans, which were a bit unnecessary, but still a fantastic dish.  We had a side of spaghetti, which was cooked to perfection. Easily the best pasta I've had- simple and delicious.  The cod- melted in my mouth. Just amazing.   And the cheesecake for dessert, served with a Greek yogurt gelato, granola, and blueberries. Words can't even describe how fantastic this was. I loved every single bite.  Of course, a meal this good comes with a rather significant price tag, but it is worth the cost. I hope I have the opportunity to return!",

Plus, it's in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, with all its glitz and glamour :) The restaurant itself is on the top floor with all the other eateries, including STK, Jaleo, Secret Pizza, etc.  As for the food, we had mixed reviews at our table. I had the duck and foie gras ravioli which was a nice light dish. Had a hint of sourness that I'm assuming was from the marsala reduction? I actually enjoyed my friend's short rib agnolotti much better. It had great flavors, the pasta was perfect, where the entire meal would have a nice texture to it and then suddenly melt into short rib goodness. The tagliatelle was OK, not a particular favorite.  Overall, the ambiance was excellent. A bit on the dimmer side with their vintage lights. They had many private booths, creating an intimate setting.",

Until I asked the waiter if he can get us another round . We waited for 40 minutes for our food . What really made me upset was a party of 4 sat literally across from us , and the customer service they received was the total opposite .",

    "text": "Once again Scarpetta takes the gold. Every time we come to Las Vegas and your restaurants, we are never disappointed with the price, service and quality of food. The great experience starts with Noe who always takes care of us and makes us feel like family every time we dine here. We were seated next to the windows that had a view of the Bellagio fountains. The staff is very on point and really make you feel like you are at a Michellin Star restaurant.    The basket of fresh baked bread was a mixture of to die for breads. They are such a great start to the meal you are about to endure. We had a five course meal and every one is posted on the review. The plating of each dish was tasty to the eyes. The Tuna and Yellow tail appetizer was the smallest bites but they were the bites to remember.  Fresh, packed with the right flavors and textures.  The beet salad was very pleasant. I never like to eat beets but I could eat this beet salad every day. The earthy ness of the flavor was amazing and the dressing was so good. The creamy polenta was to die for. I could not put my spoon down to stop eating this. Every bite had a mixture of great flavors and a bite of truffle mushrooms.  The plate of green spaghetti was sooo good. It was fresh  pasta that had an amazing kick to it. It had a small kick of spicy on every bite but the creamy sauce mellowed the spiciness.  The shrimp in the spaghetti was the perfect combination of flavors.   The braised beef was perfectly crusted and tender in the center. The two sauces that accompanied the meat was so tasty. And finally the dessert was very very very yummy. We had he Nutella stuffed doughnut balls with banana ice cream and the coconut panna Cotta was sooo good.  A must have.  The prices were soo affordable and we will always visit Scarpetta every time we go to Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Scarpetta fits well in the sophisticated Cosmopolitan Hotel. Tucked away into a corner, this restaurant is unassuming at first approach. The lights are dim and there are curvy booths on the right side facing a long bar. The walkway is narrow but keep the eye on the prize at the end because that's where the True \"meat\" of the restaurant is. Tables and booths are snugly placed in a modern yet cozy dining area. For our group of 10, the broad shouldered guys probably felt a little too close for comfort to make room for all of us to fit, but it wasn't a problem for the girls.   Last Saturday, we were in a mad rush to eat and run because we were trying to catch a 9:30pm showing of KA at MGM. Our dinner reservation was 7:30pm so we cut it close. We asked the waiter to divide our check between 5 couples and to make things worse, we did not sit next to our significant others. We brushed off the sommelier by accident because we wanted to find our waiter just to order right away. In spite of our group being a nightmare, they made our plans happen and with time to boot! The food was amazing, our checks were split perfectly, and the waiter even offered detailed directions how to get to our show quicker.   The duck fois gras ravioli and the short rib agnolotti were the two dishes my husband and I shared. We loved these dishes. The guys in our group ordered steaks which were all well prepared and the girls ordered appetizers and a couple dishes to share but I think Bry and I were the happiest out of the group with our choices, which is surprising because I always choose steak over anything.   Looking back, I feel bad that we put the staff in a position where everything needed to be rushed but overall, our entire group was impressed with the food and service. Thanks Scarpetta for that!",

Our server and every runner and busser were friendly and classy.  Attentive but completely unobtrusive.  Perfect.  The delicious meal started with their bread basket.  All of the breads and accompaniments (mascarpone butter, citrus olive oil and caponata) were great, especially the Stromboli.  That was certainly a nice surprise!  We started with the Yellowtail which was well-seasoned.  I loved the little crystals of flavored salt.    My guy had the Stracci, a wide, flat pasta served with seafood.  Very delicious and simple.  I had the foie and duck ravioli which was pretty amazing.  Both dishes were very light on sauce, which I enjoyed.  The desserts were very good as well.  Man-friend had the chocolate cake with almond gelato.  Very tasty.  My mocha cheesecake was absolutely delicious.  Great restaurant for a sexy date.",

The pepperoni stromboli bread could've been a meal alone.  For appetizers we had the Braised Short Ribs, Raw Yellowtail, and Beet Salad. The short ribs were tender, flavorful, cooked perfectly, and had a good portion size. The yellowtail was fresh and so tasty with the pickeled red onion, LOVED IT! As for the beet salad, the best I have ever eaten. (Period).  Entrees included the signature spaghetti (I will perfect this at home!), Duck & Foie Gras ravioli, and the 24 oz Ribey. The spaghetti was perfect, amazing, simple, delicious, and awesome. Our ribeye was cooked and seasoned so well, I was glad to get the last piece! The Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli...heaven in your mouth with blessings from on high...I have never been so pleased and I spent the longest time enjoying this dish.  For Dessert, we had the Crispy Sweet Risotto Crepes. These were surprisingly good and the sorbet was AWESOME! Perfect way to end the meal.  I have been thinking about the Duck Foie Gras ravioli DAILY for the past 4 weeks, you have to try them.",

The restaurant was happening on a Saturday night but there's enough space between tables that we still had a feeling of intimacy. Everything was perfectly cooked in perfect combinations of ingredients. We had two starters: braised short ribs and brussel sprouts. We shared a pasta chocked full of lots of different vegetables. It had a very earthy flavor and flavors only achieved from patiently creating a reduction. The two entrees of lamb and black cod again featured flavors from painstaking attention and time in the kitchen. Our waiter, although busy, was attentive, friendly and professional. Very nice meal and I love being a little overstuffed(that's why no dessert).",

The food was perfect - we had the creamy polenta with truffle mushrooms (my favorite dish, by far. Ever. In my whole life), spaghetti (classic and wonderful - I've never had fresh pasta before, and I was in heaven!) and I think the other dish we had was a ravioli of some kind (I can't be sure, because I was in a complete state of oblivion from my polenta and spaghetti). Either way, it was ALL fabulous.  Besides the incredible food, the service was fantastic. Our server was so sweet and helpful. The view was amazing. AND, at the end of the night - because I'd told my server about how much I loved head chef/owner Scott Conant (my favorite Food Network guy/Chopped judge!) - he had Scott himself come over to our table to take a picture with us (and he was so great!).  It was the BEST night :) Thank you to Scott Conant and Scarpetta for a wonderful dining experience.",

    "text": "The boyfriend has been pining for this restaurant after hearing about their amazing spaghetti. Also, after finding out that the man behind the restaurant is a judge from The Food Network's Chopped, I was sold.  The food did not disappoint. We had the yellow tail as an appetizer, then the famed spaghetti and the sirloin. We decided we were going to share everything and the kitchen was actually nice enough to split each dish so that it was presented on two separate plates to us. Each plate looked exactly as it would if it were the full portion. To top that off, they didn't even charge a splitting fee like so many restaurants usually would! That is what I call spectacular service.   I'm a sucker for bread and their bread basket had me half full before we even ordered! The bread filled with salami and cheese was the favorite. It came with 3 dipping sauces, a marscapone cheese, tomato with eggplant, and a citrus oil. I thought the best combination was the citrus oil with the tomato and eggplant.   The yellow tail was fresh and had a nice chili kick to it. There were small chunks of rock salt that added a little crunch. It came with 4 slices of yellow tail, which was actually more than we expected.  The spaghetti lives up to its reputation. It was beautifully presented, swirled up into a pile and they uncover the plate right in front of you. The sauce is perfectly seasoned and the tomatoes still have a slight acidity. The pasta itself is cooked al dente and they're beautifully thick spaghetti noodles. I had to eat this one noodle at a time so I could make it last as long as possible.   The sirloin was cooked to our liking, but it was a bit chewy. We both loved the vegetables that came underneath it. There were carrots, mushrooms, potatoes, and probably some others and they were all so good!  At the last minute, we decided to get the amedei chocolate cake with the almond gelato and salted caramel sauce. The gelato was my favorite part of the plate, although it looked partly melted by the time it got to the table. The chocolate cake was like a lava cake, where the middle is still fudge like. It could have been warmer. I thought the plate could use more of the gelato and almond gelato to balance out how rich the chocolate is. Also, the bf ordered a coffee and it came with refills!   One complaint is that we were seated along the wine fridge and someone would come by every once in a while and just open it up behind us. Having the chilled refrigerator air interrupt a nice meal isn't the most fun. But if you are seated by the window, there is an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.  For the price, it was actually a good amount of food and it is quality food. I really cannot wait for the spaghetti again. When I eat my jarred Preggo tomato sauce, I'll be fantasizing about the spaghetti here.",

    "text": "This will be my VERY FIRST Yelp review and I couldn't be more excited to post it! I look to Yelp on a daily basis but have never felt as compelled to leave a review as I do about our experience at Scarpetta...spoiler alert: this could get lengthy!   My boyfriend and I were taking a mini vacation to Vegas and did extensive research on restaurants, as we wanted to treat ourselves to one night of fine dining while we were there. We found Scarpetta's Yelp listing and looked through every single photo and read a ton of reviews (even the not so great ones :( )and decided this was going to be our place!   Our reservation was for 10p.m. but we arrived at around 9 and were told we could be accommodated immediately. I asked if there was any possibility of getting a window table, and apologized for not requesting it when we made our res. The extremely nice hostess told us that wouldn't be a problem at all and after waiting, maybe 2 minutes tops, we were taken to our table. They weren't kidding about the view by the window! The view was gorgeous and we were looking right out at the Bellagio water show(s).  The lighting IS very dark, but for us that made it even more romantic, which was the exact experience we were hoping for.   Our cocktails were EXCELLENT. I had a \"basic\" dirty martini with blue cheese olives and it was by far the best martini I've ever had.  Our server, Julian, even brought a tiny shot glass of extra olive juice just in case it was still too dry for my taste, but I didn't need it!    For starters, we chose the Diver Scallops and the White Corn Soup. When they were brought to our table, the server mentioned they took it upon themselves to split the scallops for us so that \"we could each get the best of what the dish had to offer.\"  Julian made the excellent suggestion of combining the crispy pancetta with the rest of the dish's ingredients, rather than taste it on its own, as that was how the chef intended for it to be eaten.  He was SO right! What an absolutely delicious combination and just the perfect portion size.  The soup was served in one bowl for us to share, and once again, we were blown away. Just enough king crab to give it a bit of body, but still a light enough soup that we were able to enjoy it and be ready for more (so, so much more!)  They gave us the complimentary basket of warm fresh breads and again we were surprised because of the variety they provided! Even most nice restaurants will give you one or two selections, but here? 5 choices and then 3 options for spreads/ dipping.   We finished our amazing cocktails and decided to each get a glass of wine to compliment our meal.  As soon as the wine list was brought back to our table, a man came over and introduced himself as the sommelier and asked if he could suggest any wines to accompany our entrees.  I drink white and my boyfriend drinks red, and we got very different entrees, but the sommelier was extremely helpful and described the selections perfectly.  Naturally, we chose his suggestions!   Now on to the entrees:  My boyfriend chose the duck ravioli and I went with the tagliatelle dish. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing! When I asked Julian to please give a bit more detail about the Tagliatelle entree, he described it as \"definitely more of a comfort meal\" and he couldn't have been more right.  The pasta was extremely fresh and even though the sauce itself was on the heavier side, it did not overwhelm the dish at all.  I'm not a fan of duck but my boyfriend could not say enough great things about his dish and the presentation was perfect! The sommelier stopped back after we sipped our wine for a bit and asked how the flavors were complimenting the dishes. He was just doing his job but made us feel important, none the less.   Dinner was cleared and we were so full but they hadn't let us down yet so we chose the Amedei chocolate cake. Heaven! Just enough of everything on the plate for you to enjoy it without setting yourself over the edge.   I do apologize for the length of this review, but I felt that sharing this absolutely amazing experience was important for anyone that might be on the fence about trying this place! The ambiance was romantic, relaxing, and quiet with beautiful views- perfect for a date night.  The service was excellent.  When we choose to \"dine\" we like to sit and relax and enjoy  and not feel rushed and we were not disappointed here.  We never felt rushed nor did we feel neglected either.  They seemed to understand that we were there to enjoy ourselves and never made us feel like we were hanging around too long/ late.  The presentation of every single plate was perfection.  The food was some of the best we've ever had. I can definitely appreciate that restaurants can't be a \"10\" every single night, and things do sometimes happen, but our experience was outstanding and will definitely be somewhere we come back to the next time we're in town!!",

    "text": "3.97 stars.  After a long day traveling to Las Vegas via Los Angeles, we were hungry and ready to celebrate our rather short weekend in Sin City.  We were able to get a booth in the designated bar area that was a bit more casual than the beautiful main dinning room.  Oh \"Little Shoe\", how pretty you are.  Ambiance:  4 stars.    We started with a few appetizers:  The Beet Salad (2.5 stars) that my friend said was just okay and average at best; The Chestnut Soup (4 stars) was actually quiet nice and sort of like a bisque with nice chunks of pickled brussel sprouts that I usually never have, but really enjoyed; and The Braised Beef (3.5 stars) with fall root vegetables and faro risotto.  One dinner entree was the Tagliatelle pasta (3.75 stars) with fall root vegetables, truffle zabaglione and guanciale (Italian bacon).  This was the lighter of our three dishes and came in 3rd place.  The runner up dish was the Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli in a marsala reduction (5 stars!)  Wonderfully rich and decadent, like buttah!!!  We thought the best dish was the Short Rib Agnolotti (5 stars!) of brown butter horseradish.  A stellar dish that had such an intriguing zing of fresh horseradish.  Giddy up little doggie, giddy up!!  Service was okay, a bit non existent initially and it took awhile to get two additional settings for our party of three; then ask for a missing bread dish.  Other than that, the waiter made his Italian wine recommendations that turned out to be not bad.  Service:  4 stars.  Tally:   Ambiance:  4 stars  (\"New Romantic\" 80's music, a tad bit loud) Beet Salad:  2.5 stars Chestnut Soup:  4 stars Braised Beef:  3.5 stars Tagliatelle pasta:  3.75 stars Duck & Foie Gras ravioli:  5 stars! Short Rib Agnolotti:  5 stars! Service:  4 stars 4+2.5+4+3.5+3.75+5+5+4= 31.75/8= 3.97 stars.",

    "text": "Superb service, great food.  There are so many choices in Las Vegas it can be overwhelming. We wanted to try Scott Conant's Scarpetta because we had heard it was very good. We made reservations and arrived on time. They were just opening and we sat at the bar and had a drink. The bar is gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly.  After we were seated and ordered drinks they brought us a really nice bread tray. I recommend the salami and cheese bread as the best of the bunch but everything in there was superb. The marscapone butter was a nice touch.  I ordered the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms for an app. Super dish, and creamy really does describe it. I could make a meal out of it.  For my main course I had the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti which are like mini ravioli's. It was very rich and savory. The bread crumb crust on top was crispy and added some texture. Don't let the term bone marrow scare you it merely adds a depth of flavor.  For dessert my wife had the flourless chocolate cake with homemade gelato. There was nothing wrong with my coconut panna cotta, a custard like dessert but after tasting her cake i wish I has ordered that as well.  All in all a great meal at a reasonable price. I would definitely go there again on our next rip to LV.",

    "text": "Scarpetta is just one of those restaurants in Vegas that you must check out. The atmosphere is quite different than the usual Vegas type (loud and filled with buzz) restaurants. Its romantic, intimate and just has a classy atmosphere. It was relaxing to have wonderful, kind servers there to help you choose a cocktail or a good mix of entrees.   We went to celebrate a friends birthday, and let me tell you we have never eaten better. We ordered a few appetizers, entrees and were too full for dessert. I remember the veal entree being my favorite dish of the evening. Everything was on point from the presentations to flavors. I would say that the wine list was excellent but some of their cocktails are an acquired taste. The server was gracious enough to replace one of the drinks when asked.   I cant wait to eat here again. A favorite for sure.",

Nice bottle of white wine poured during cocktails to get warm... Plates were placed at the wrong guest... One of the orders was wrong and had to be redone leaving the other plates to get cold... Watch out though for the double check... Check was brought to me... I gave my credit card... When the receipt came back to sign it had been run through at $100 more without explanation.... I called the manager the next day... He expressed concern, but did nothing to correct the problem... At the end of the day, seems to be just another case of cynical strip restaurant management... Too bad, we had wanted to check out this restaurant for awhile... Probably should have gone with Milos that night...",

    "text": "Came here for a romantic Anniversary dinner after seeing great reviews by other Yelpers and we were definitely steered in the right direction.  We had made reservation a week in advance and were hoping to get a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains, though they told us they can't promise and that we will have to try our luck when we arrive. We made it to our reservation on time, yet we still had to wait 20 minutes, which was alittle annoying considering we had made reservations. Though we didn't get a fountain view, we were too hungry at that point to care.  Our server immediately bought out a bread basket with a trio of olive oil, eggplant and honey butter. THE BREAD WAS INCREDIBLE!!! My favorite was the salami and cheese filled one (I still dream about it). For appettizer we got the MEDITERRAEN OCTOPUS, which was cooked just perfectly! For our entrees we got PRIME FILET OF BEEF and RAVIOLI FOIE GRAS AND DUCK. Though the ravioli was underwhelming, there was lot of ravioli squares which really was great. The filet of beef, on the other hand, was absolutely amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the softest beef I've ever had in my life. This really was the greatest dish I've ever eaten in my life and I was beyond impressed.  For dessert, we had mentioned that it was our anniversary and were given a chocolate cake with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY writing, which was a lovely surprise. Sadly,. the cake was very dry but the ice-cream helped.  In all I would highly recommend Scarpetta and would love to come back here for our next Vegas trip!!",

    "text": "As others have said here, if you're a Vegas tourist who thinks that the Olive Garden is good Italian, and you just want to treat your girlfriend while in Vegas -- this probably isn't the place for you. You're going to feel the portions are small, and you may not appreciate the things that make this restaurant extraordinary.  First, price -- be prepared. WIth a first and second course, without alcohol or dessert, it's easily $40 to $50 per person. I enjoyed a glass of wine and the famous spaghetti, and my meal was $46. The wine was over priced -- Scarpetta should compare its wine pricing per glass to other similar restaurants in Vegas, and I think they would find that they are a bit too high. $15-17 per glass is a bit much.  Second quality -- The bread basket alone was incredible. I swore that I would have only one piece, but I could not resist the hot stramboli with proscuitto and cheese, and the salted butter spread was amazing. The spaghetti also was extraordinary. It is a simple dish with tomato and basil only, but the flavors combined with the thick homemade pasta made the dish memorable. It is one of the few dishes I've had where I felt that the fresh and homemade nature of the pasta really made a difference.  Finally--the view. It is one of the best in Vegas, overlooking Bellagio and the Bellagio fountains. The dark woods, the view, the candle lit room -- a wonderful place for a romantic dinner. If I'd only had a date. :)",

The service was excellent and I disagree with a previous yelper who said service came with a serious attitude.  Our server was kind, helpful, and not at all pretentious.  The only thing that I would like to see on their very extensive wine list is more mid-range bottle options.  There were hardly any bottles of wine under $100.00.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the wait staff was great (very friendly, polite and professional). The view from the restaurant is on the Bellagio fountains, which was very nice (you actually get a nice panoramic view of part of the strip). As for the food, I was pleasantly surpised. I had the duck foie gras ravioli and it was quite nice. My girlfriend had the Pici pasta which was absolutely amazing! If you are in Vegas and looking to have a nice dinner I would say head over to Scarpetta.",

    "text": "For years, I've always felt that -- among the casinos -- the MGM Grand has the best restaurants.  This may be changing, and Scarpetta is *certainly* one of the biggest reasons why.    Lynn and I followed up our \"good\" dinner Wednesday night at Comme Ca (also Yelped) with dinner at Scarpetta the next night (followed Friday night by LoS, but that's been written up way to many times).    Being a Celebrity Chef is a double-edged sword . . . it certainly gets your name out there, but then you (typically) aren't there to defend it -- someone ELSE is in the kitchen is, but if it sucks, you get the blame.  A potentially dicey proposition at best.  Scott Conant need not worry; his Vegas outpost is in excellent hands.  The six of us began with a bottle of n.v. Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet (Cuvee Ste.-Anne), and ordered a round of appetizers \"for the table.\"  (The table, too, apparently was hungry -- not just the six of us!)    Finishing the Champagne just as the appetizers arrived, we moved into a 2008 Bruno Giacosa Arneis.  We enjoyed the yellowtail crudo, the creamy polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms (the winner of this round, IMHO), and the roasted sea scallops with porcini and sunchokes . . . all were delightful!  VEGETARIAN ALERT:  this place is *very* cool, and vegetarian-friendly.  They have a totally separate vegetarian and vegan menu available for the asking (as one in our party did).  Moving into the pasta course, we had the spaghetti with tomato and basil (so simple to say, so profound to eat -- nothing can describe the layers of flavor that you get here; magnificent!), the duck & foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction (OK, this is to die for!), and the short rib agnolotti with with brown butter horseradish.  Of course, we also moved into a stunning Piedmontese red, the 1999 Barbaesco Riserva Vigneti in Ovello from the  Produttori del Barbaresco.  Just gorgeous!  Our entrees included black cod with caramelized fennel & concentrated tomato, sirloin with potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, parmigiano & barolo ragu, a veal chop the size of Baltimore (and much more tasty), and the aforementioned spaghetti with tomato and basil (as an entree portion).    A little dessert, a little Porto and coffee, and the world is a perfect place!  P.S. In case you haven't figured it out yet, their wine list is not only incredible, but there are some True gems on this list that remain real bargains (if you know how/where to look).",

We arrived for our 930pm dinner reservation only to be stuffed into one side of the resturant, as if to give the appearance that the nearly empty restaurant had patrons. My wife ordered the white fish and I the chicken. When the food finally arrived the fish was way undercooked and my chicken dry. When we brought this to the attention of waiter, he took her fish back to the kitchen. Upon its return we observed that the chef had just cut her fish in half, cooked the remaining portion and tossed the rest.  It was like they couldn't  wait to close the resturant and get all of its customers out the door. Not sure if there has been a change of the guard at this highly recommended resturant, but, based on our experience, we wish we could have made reservations somewhere else.",

    "text": "I have no intention to return to Scarpetta after having dined there last night on the pre-fixe menu for Restaurant Week. First I will state what is warranting the one star: a wonderful Chianti and delicious heirloom tomatoes.   This is what I was served:  Heirloom Tomato Salad - I thought the presentation was lovely and all the flavors were good and spread out. The heirloom tomatoes were very tasty. I was not disappointed with this dish.  Aged Sirloin Beef; Potato Gnocchi, Wild Mushrooms, Parmigiano & Barolo Ragu - I am fairly certain my dish did not have ANY mushrooms in it and I was very disappointed in this fact. Was it because we were dining on the RW menu? I guess mushrooms only go to those paying full price? The sirloin was O.K.. nothing special. I will admit the waiter suggested I get it medium and I opted for medium-well, maybe my mistake here - but the fact the meat had quite a bit of fat on it and gristle was NOT my fault.  Amadei Chocolate Cake Toasted Almond Gelato & Salted Caramel Sauce - The cake was very rich and I was pleased with it, however I felt as though it was something that could be served up at an Applebee's for goodness sake, not a fine dining establishment.  On to the even worse (because the food was actually okay) was the service. Our waiter was horrid. Just absolutely, down-right inattentive and spaced out beyond belief. He was an older gentlemen. Mistakes made:  - Incredibly slow service - Offering us a wine menu, but not taking our wine order until we gave it to him ourselves - The wine took forever to arrive and in the mean time he did not return to take our meal orders - Had tap water poured into our water cups that were filled with the water we PAID FOR - He did a poor-ass job of describing the meals, as did the others serving us - Just the most bland service EVER; did not ask us how our food was, did not chat with us at all, just did not care in general  Was it because we were there on the RW Menu? Maybe. And if that is the way an establishment runs a wonderful event for a good cause for a charity than I have absolutely no intention of ever returning to order off the menu. There are better places I can go in Vegas to have fine Italian dining. Scarpetta is not one of them.",

It sounds plain, but was the best I've ever eaten.  Seriously.   I wanted to hate this restaurant so much because Scott Connant is such a stickler for his pasta on \"Chopped\".  I was ready to pounce out a bad review because the pasta was not right, or the seasoning was off.  But I have to say I had nothing to complain about, it was utterly a fantastic experience and the pasta was awesome! Even the stromboli bread that they brought out left me speechless.  Ok, so not speechless where I couldn't ask for more, but you get the picture.  Scott, well done!!!",

For some reason when the farfalle came out all the sauce had shifted to the bottom of the dish so at first bite i was like WTF, and then i got to the bottom where all the sauce and lobster were hanging out - mmmmmmmmm. nom nom nom.   The entrees were amazing. I had the cod, and i tasted the sirloin steak - which was excellent. The deserts were amazing too. We had the panna cotta, the chocolate cake and the nutella filled donut holes and they were fucking rad.   This is a really pretty restaurant too inside, its beautifully designed and it has a view of the bellagio fountain which is cool. Its a place to take the misses for sure.

I knew it was more expensive but from the reviews I was assuming it was worth it.  I definitely do not think it was.  The food was good, but not worth the price tag.  The pastas were the best part so if you do make it to Scarpetta I would suggest sticking to one of the pastas.  The total bill for the 6 of us was around $500.  We ordered a few drinks and a couple bottles of wine and though I don't have anything about the food to complain about I just don't think it was worth $500.  Normally when I have a meal with that price point I am expecting some experimentation with foods or unique pairings.  Scarpetta did not try anything new.  Steaks, typical pastas, decent portions, but nothing new.    There are so many choices for restaurants in Vegas so I just can't recommend this one.",

Upon sitting down we were offered two types of water, nice touch. A few minutes later passed and we were greeted by the assistant manager Kelly, asked if this had been our first time and we replied yes.   Knowing the Executive chef Dan Rossi, we were treated to having him select our food and then having his wine sommelier (Paulo) pair wines with each course. If you know very little about wines, like myself, I would highly recommend Paulo making the decisions for you, this guy is a master at his trade. Our wines complimented each course perfectly and it truly made the night one to remember.   Trying to remember everything we ate would be a six page review so I'll just touch on a few must haves, not that we didn't thoroughly enjoy every dish, because everything was an orgasmic explosion of flavors on the tongue, but I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Polenta with a five mushroom ragu, unbelievable. Their signature spaghetti, out of this world. Ravioli's with Foie Gras and duck, I could have eaten 20. Some Carmel pudding dessert with this homemade salted Carmel toffee with crushed pretzels was insane. That was just a few of the fifteen things we got, also Fritto Misto, is a must.   Basically your not going to go wrong with anything in this place, food is off the hook, service staff paid attention to every detail and the view of the Strip is the best. This will be on my stop every time I visit Vegas from here on out, period.",

    "text": "We were seated at a table by the window with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The atmosphere is the best thing about this place. While the Cosmo pushes the boundary of being too gaudy, even for Vegas, Scarpetta is sleek and elegant in a refined way. The dining room doesn't feel crowded, and while it's quiet enough that you'll sometimes hear other conversations, the noise isn't intrusive.  In addition to wine, I ordered a Pisco Flower off of their cocktail menu. It was well made, but nothing to write home about.  The complimentary bread was outstanding, as were the accompaniments. They brought us olive oil, an olive tapenade, and a creamy mascarpone spread.  We ordered the brussell sprouts, broccoli rabe, and burata as appetizers. The burata was good, as were the pickled beets that came with it. The brussell sprouts cam with apple slices and a cream sauce. It was fine, but would have benefited from more caramelization on the sprouts. The broccoli rabe was just disappointing. Indistinguishable from the version you might get  at a diner or buffet on the side of the highway.  I ordered the fettuccine as my entree. It was delicious, one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Someone pointed out that it tasted like pizza. This brought it down a bit after seeing that it was True. It tasted like a sausage and roasted pepper pizza, but this wasn't a bad thing. My friend had the famed duck foie gras ravioli, and it fell short. The foie gras filling was rich, but airy and light. It felt incomplete without a heavier component to pair with it. Perhaps my bite missed one of the small dabs of sauce that was strewn about. I didn't try the agnolotti or the spaghetti that were also ordered, but they looked very good.  Our server brought our friend a nice little dessert sampler for his birthday at the end. Service was great throughout, but it felt a bit odd when they began clearing plates before everyone was finished eating.  Overall, had a great time here and would come back.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm easy to please (doubtful) or just as not as sophisticated as some, or maybe they have had some off nights. I've seen some not-so-great reviews of this establishment. Frankly, I don't know what it would take to please them. My new bride and I went there for our \"fancy meal\" during our honeymoon. I wanted it to be a nice and memorable experience for her as she has not eaten in as many fine dining places as I have. Scarpetta delivered. When making my reservations weeks ago I asked for a window table with a view of the fountains at Bellagio in a quiet area. We sat at what is probably the best table in the house. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Having read all of the posted reviews I knew I wanted to try the spaghetti but we didn't want it as our main dish so we went \"off script\" a bit and ordered it as an appetizer. They spit it for us perfectly. That dish alone could have ended the night on a high note. House made pasta cooked perfectly with a simple tomato and basil sauce. Heavenly. Oh, I forgot to mention the bread. The bread. Neither of us are big carb eaters but my God that bread was good! I ordered the pork chop and she ordered the fillet. Both were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We both had unforgettable desserts as well. I had the chocolate cake and she had the Bombolinis. Even the coffee was one of the best cups I ever had.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a over the top meal at a great place. We will be back.",

Scarpetta LV is light years ahead of its namesake in Manhattan's Meatpacking district.  The service is, without a question, much better here than in NYC and so was the food. Scarpetta NYC, on the other hand, has a quirkier, much more interesting wine list featuring Italian wines exclusively.  So, I guess you'd have to visit both locations and decide for yourself.",

    "text": "After much research on where to dine for our five year wedding anniversary, my husband and I decided on Scarpetta. The menu looked delicious and the prices weren't outrageous. We called about three weeks in advance to make our reservation for seven people. I was surprised that they only had one time left but was very happy we were able to get in at 7:30pm. We were all super excited to dine there. I tweeted about it and they even tweeted back at me, which I thought was a nice touch.   We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and only had to wait about five minutes for a table. We were hoping for a table by the window but didn't get one. We were near the wine wall but could still see the Bellagio fountains.   I'll break this review into two parts.  SERVICE: I'd never been to a higher end restaurant like this before, so I was expecting exceptional service like I had never previously received. While the service was very good, it didn't live up to my expectations. Our waiter was a really nice guy, but I think he might have been newer because he seemed a little bit awkward and shy. Also, I asked him to take a picture of our whole group and he forgot. Then two people had to leave so when he finally did take the pic, not everyone was there. There was another man (Paul?) who was in charge of the wine and he was another story. He was so suave and charming. I wish he could have been our waiter! There was a major glitch in our evening considering the type of place we were at. We receieved our bill, and as we were looking over it we realized they put two $125 bottles of wine on it rather than just the one. I'm glad we noticed, because that's a fairly big mistake to make. Service in general was on the slower side. There were many gaps where nobody came to our table. We were there for about two hours. The guy refilling the water glasses was really nice, though.  FOOD: Between the seven of us, we ordered: -Crispy fritto misto (x2) -Heirloom tomato salad -Creamy polenta -Tagliatelle (x2) (this is what I ordered) -Duck and foie gras ravioli -Spaghetti -Pea tortelli -I know I'm missing one, but I can't remember/obviously didn't try a bite.  I had bites of everything and it was all delicious. Of course, the bread starter was fantastic. The polenta was great and rich. The ravioli was so rich, I wouldn't have been able to eat it as my main dish. It was also incredibly salty. It might be nice in a smaller size as a starter. The vegetables in my tagliatelle were super fresh - such a difference fresh veggies make! The spaghetti was very good, fresh and delicious, but it didn't knock my socks off like it has for some other people. Of all of the pastas I tried, I would order the pea tortelli next time. The portion sizes are not large, but just a nice amount to leave you satisfied and not bursting.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. Not as intimate as I wanted, but I think we would have had to spend more somewhere else for that. I was sort of surprised that there were a lot of skimpily dressed stagettes and dudes in t-shirts and BASEBALL HATS!   We had a very good experience here but it just fell a bit short of my expectations based on the many other reviews I read.",

Lobster and spaghetti in a sauce with a spicy finish.  The ladies had the short rib agnolotti which was also very delicious.  We decided that the Pici was the best of the two just because of the wonderful spiciness. All of the pastas were cooked perfectly.  The service was great, and we were never rushed to decide what we wanted to eat or to finish anything.  It was a wonderful evening.",

Furthermore, we lucked out with getting a window table with a view overlooking the Bellaggio fountains next door. I started with the legendary tomato-basil spaghetti and quickly understood why it receives such rave reviews! The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was delightful. My friend was equally pleased with her truffled polenta starter and second course of short rib agnolotti. The roasted scallops I chose were divine. We also shared a side of mixed mushrooms, but could hardly make a dent in them although they were delicious! In True Vegas style, the portions are quite generous.

Anyways, we tried their pasta dish with short rib, which the short rib was missing on that plate. I don't know where it was incorporated. If I was a chopped judge I would have taken points off for not really tasting this main ingredient in that dish. The horseradish was definitely the main kick in that dish. We also tried the Bronzini fish dish which was pretty good and made to perfection. We tried our friends dish who got the foi gras ravioli and that was the highlight of the table. For desert we got the little round donuts which were pretty good. I have to mention that the bread service was definitely one of a kind with some bread baked with some kinda salami.",

The sommelier helped us choose the perfect wine that was within our budget.  It was super earthy, full bodied, and reminded me of being in Italy!

I get the sense that Scarpetta doesn't book as many reservations as say, STK or Blue Ribbon (my server confirmed they get good overflow traffic) but it'd be a mistake to overlook this place.

Appetizer: Tuna 'Susci' - interesting dish with tuna serving as the nori by wrapping vegetables. so fresh so clean. nice recommendation by the staff and exactly what i was looking for.

Being that Vegas is expected to bring the best of the best and be over priced I was nervous taking my parents there when my dad was meeting my boyfriend for the first time.  I am Italian and we take eating meals together very seriously.  I must say that I was not disappointed one bit.  Their decor and ambience alone was impressive.  It was elegant and slightly rustic but not tacky like you see often in Vegas.  From the very well dressed GM Kelli who seated us to the extremely polite food runners the entire experience was definitely a plus.  Having worked in the food and beverage industry on the east coast and west coast I can be a tough critic but I would recommend this establishment to anyone who isn't afraid to spend some money on a good meal.  The appetizers were fairly small portioned but paired with the entree and dessert this place is perfect to have a 3 course meal and be more than satisfied.  I hardly give 5 stars and did not take a look at the wine menu so I can not speak on that.  I will have to return in order to add another star.  Thanks Scarpetta!",

    "text": "I was very much looking forward to my first visit to Scarpetta, I had heard great things about it and couldn't wait.   I was surprised that the menu was so limited.  The appetizers were very limited and if you don't like seafood, tartare, or mushrooms it will be a challenge to find anything you can eat.  I wasn't able to find anything which was a bummer.  I was also surprised that there wasn't an offering of dinner salads or anything like that before the meal.    The highlight before the entrees arrived was actually the bread, there is a warm bread that has some cheese and a salami or beef in it.  It tastes like fresh pizza bread and it is amazing.  I might visit again for this bread alone.  For the entree, I had the veal cooked medium.  It was good but the mustard sauce was a bit tangy and was not my favorite.  I tried to limit the amount that was on my veal as much as possible.  Otherwise, the veal was cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  It was not fatty and there was plenty of meat on the bone.  For dessert I enjoyed the Nutella & Vanilla Creme Bombolini.  I had no idea what to expect but it was like mini doughnut holes filled with either the creme or the nutella in the center.  The ice cream that came with it was banana and was quite good as well.  It was a great dessert to share and I would recommend this to anyone looking for an indulgent dessert.  Service here was great.  We were checked on frequently and the food was delivered promptly after ordering.",

    "text": "Ate there in March for a birthday celebration and was NOT disappointed.  This place is great and highly recommended.  The ambience is great. You do walk through a rather long narrow bar area, but when you get to the main dining area, you will be impressed. Great views of the strip.  We were seated in a very private booth with floor to ceiling \"booth\" - it was intimate and allowed the 6 of us to really talk.    The service - attentive.  Not overbearing, not pushing (i..e we weren't that hungry and didn't order apps).  The breadbasket - yummy!!!!!   Several tried the black cod - delicous!! I had the duck - it was wonderful and cooked just right.  Portions are on the smaller side, so if you are hungry make certain you order an appetizer.  The entrees were mostly in the $30 range, though some a bit cheaper.  They brought a lovely molten chocolate lava cake thing for the birthday boy, which was really tasty.  The wine list is huge! Not cheap, but some good selections.  Overall - certainly a place I would return.",

Although the food was amazing the first time, I think the dinning room is not configured well for romance.  Tables are close, like cafeteria kind of close.  In addition the service was just a disconnect...  But let's discuss this visit.   Amazing.  Sat at the bar and got phenomenal treatment from the bartender.  As all the parties paraded by or waited for the tables, the bar staff not only took care of those folks but some how made me feel i was not eating my dinner in a waiting area.  I started with the roasted Scallops YUMMMMMMM.  Then I had the most magnificent piece of red meat that has ever passed between these lips...  Kobe Rib Cap.  Oh glorious rib cap.  Never have I had entire plate of rib cap,  In fact I had to Google it to know what it was.  Worth the effort to research and read up on it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  So amazing service, great cocktails, nice wine selection and the best steak I have ever eaten.  My new favorite.",

Braised Short Ribs of Beef - It was good, the short rib was braised well although a bit salty. I didn't really understand or like farro risotto.   Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli - I like Foie, but I just wasn't a fan of this. The texture reminds me of cow brains. It is also very rich.   Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - This was OK, but nothing spectacular. It was also a bit rich, and the horseradish was a bit too much at times.   Mediterranean Orata - The seared fish was good, but nothing too special. Fish was almost too slimy.   After reading all these great reviews, I'm starting to feel like I missed something. I'm not sure if it's my palate or if the food is just overrated? Everything I tried was really rich in flavor, and I left both pastas half finished. Maybe I went in expecting too much? If anyone feels the same as, please let me know. I can't be the only person that feels this way right?   Service was good, except the host looked like she wanted to go home badly.",

    "text": "So while at a convention in Vegas, my two co-workers and I came here for dinner on 10/6/13 on a recommendation from a friend who claimed it's the best restaurant in the city. All three of us did the tasting menu ($110 per person) and two of us opted for the wine pairing with it (additional $45 per person). With all the delicious looking options on the menu, it seemed this was the way to go. Here's what was included:   -DUO OF YELLOWTAIL AND TUNA \"SUSCI\". Wine pairing: Adami, Prosecco, Veneto, n/v. The \"susci\" was the first tasting and my least favorite of all. Nothing special to me. Or at least I didn't get what was supposed to be special about it. The roll with the carrots was kind of gross actually. I was hoping things would turn around quickly, and they did. Ohhhh they did.  -ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS, MORELS, SUGAR SNAP, WATERMELON RADISH & PEA FROTH. Wine pairing: Iberian Remix, Albarino, Edna Valley 2009.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the puree that was served on the side. My friend however didn't enjoy the wine that was paired with it. He's a big Albarino drinker and said it tasted like \"it was sitting on the shelf a little too long.\" I didn't really notice that until he said it, but I have to agree. That could have just been a bad bottle though and not an accurate representation of the wine itself.  -SPAGHETTI TOMATO BASIL & SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI. Wine pairing: Il Poggione, Rosso di Montalcino, Tuscany 2008. I don't care what anyone says- the spaghetti was fantastic. I'm drinking the Kool-Aid here. Yes, the sauce is very simple, but it really made me notice and appreciate the texture and freshness of the noodles more. Sometimes spaghetti is better when it's simple I guess. I would definitely order it again.   The short rib agnolotti- dish of the night. The three of us unanimously agreed on this. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever devoured in 10 seconds. The horseradish breadcrumbs were a great finishing touch.  -FENNEL SPICED BLACK COD, CONCENTRATED TOMATOES, MANTECATO & BLACK OLIVE OIL. Wine pairing: Jermann Red Angel, Pinot Noir, Friuli 2008.  The cod was spiced well, but maybe a tad undercooked for my liking. I still finished it.   -SPICED DUCK BREAST, ENDIVE, PRESERVED ORANGE & CIPPOLLINI. Wine pairing: Feudi di San Gregorio, Rubrato, Aglianico, Campania 2009. The duck was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor. My friend sitting next to me was already so stuffed by this point, that he couldn't eat his, so being the fat fuck that I am, I ate his too.  -AMEDEI CHOCOLATE CAKE TOASTED ALMOND GELATO. Wine pairing: Quinta do Noval, Colheita, Tawny Port, Portugal 1997. I'm normally not a big dessert guy, but this cake was outstanding. Perfect way to cap off the tasting.  ...and here were a few complimentary items our table was given to share:  - BREAD BASKET. It was served with three different dips (citrus olive oil, tomato-eggplant, and marscapone butter). Some of the pieces of bread had salami baked into it, and those were amazing! Just try not to fill up on them if you're doing the tasting menu, because you have A LOT of food on the way.  - CREAMY POLENTA WITH FRICASSEE OF TRUFFLED MUSHROOMS. The polenta was definitely one of the highlights, although it could have benefited from being a tad thicker since the mushroom sauce liquified it significantly, once mixed  in. But great flavors, nonetheless.  - SHOE STRING CALAMARI AND ZUCCHINI. I think there was some fennel in here too. We finished every last string.  All three of us immensely enjoyed the tasting menu. To say that we were not left disappointed by the portion sizes would be an understatement. We could barely walk out of there without toppling over. I certainly didn't have much room for alcoholic beverages for the remainder of the night. Probably a good thing, knowing me and Vegas.  You might notice I didn't have much to say about the wines. That's because unlike the food, they were all pretty unremarkable. I'm a pretty avid wine drinker and I didn't recognize any of these wines by name before they were poured for me, so it was almost expected. If I ever did the tasting menu again, I'd most likely skip the wine pairing option and just order a bottle of something decent and familiar off their wine menu.   My biggest gripe about this place was the waiter. Although friendly and accommodating, he could barely be heard over the background noise, and with his thick accent, it made him very difficult to understand. Tastings obviously are supposed to be interactive and I had to ask him to repeat everything he said at least once. This became a little frustrating and kind of depreciated the experience for me. I wish he had left a copy of the menu on our table so I didn't have to go to their website afterward to finally discover what some of the things I ate were.  The bottom line is I would definitely return to Scarpetta, especially since I just realized there is one in Beverly Hills (doh!).",

I made a reservation several weeks in advance because I wasn't honestly sure how hard it was to get in lol. I'd heard that some of the seating has a view of the Bellagio fountain so I was hoping that's where we would be seated. As soon as we arrived the hostess led us back and we were seated along the window with the beautiful view I'd hoped for. We ordered drinks and received the best bread basket I will probably ever have in my lifetime. It had a variety of different types of bread and served along side it was a citrus olive oil, whipped mascarpone butter and an eggplant tapenade. Next we had the beef tartare which was outstanding. I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the short rib agnolotti. They were both rich but had such depth of flavor. The pasta was tender and perfectly cooked. I could go on and on. We finished with espresso and the bomboloni which was so good. Normally I don't like banana flavored things but the gelato was delicious. The bomboloni were sorta like Italian beignets, light,  fluffy, and slightly crisp on the outside. The service throughout the meal was wonderful, the ambiance was relaxing and the food was perfect. Overall it was the type of meal I will remember for a really long time.",

We then ordered the duck foie gras ravioli and the spaghetti with marinara sauce. I know spaghetti sounds like such a simple thing to order but our waiter was raving about it. He was right- it was done to perfection. I will have to try the Scarpetta in NYC and see how it compares",

    "text": "This is the fine dining restaurant at Cosmopolitan that I've been looking for.  Beautiful restaurant.  Impeccable service.  Great food.  Hip music not played too loud.  Perfect.  We started with the roasted scallops ($17) which is 2 scallops with porcini mushrooms and sunchokes.  It came with some sort of sauce that was unidentifiable.  The flavor of the sauce just didn't come through and was overpowered by the mushrooms and sunchokes.  Still the scallops, mushrooms, and sunchokes were all perfectly cooked and tasty.  Next I tried the Orata Rosso ($33), which is red snapper that comes with tomatoes, chard, and clams (out of the shell).  So yummy!  My husband had the halibut ($30), which came with potatoes.  An interesting combination but really tasty.  The show stealer was the lobster pasta ($35).  Black farfelle with lobster and basil bread crumbs.  Excellent flavor combination, texture, everything.  Black farfelle is kind of interesting to look at, too.  For dessert, we had the peach crostada ($11) - kind of like a peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and blackberries.  Very good.  We also had the zeppoles ($11), which are beignets stuffed with nutella and covered in chocolate with a very yummy vanilla sauce.  Our latte and cappucino ($6 each) were also very good.  We had a couple glasses of wine which were good.  Pinot Grigio ($10) and Falanghina ($16).  The wine list is a little confusing because they list some wines by the glass and others as quartinos.  But the quartinos are not any larger than a normal glass of wine.  I should have gotten clarification about the difference.  Maybe next time.  The view is decent but not as good as Comme Ca.  Still, I am looking forward to coming back to this restaurant and trying the tasting menu. Hoping this can make my Best of the Best list.",

    "text": "First Impressions: Classy, classy, classy! Scarpetta is located on the 3rd floor in the Cosmo and everything about this restaurant screams class.   My reservation for Scarpetta was for 1/1/2014 at 7:30 pm. The actual reservation was made about a week prior and I had put in a request to be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Upon arrival, the hostess said they had tried their best to accommodate my request but that we would be seated one row away from the window view of the fountains. Nevertheless, I appreciate the honesty and their earnest efforts.   The service was impeccable and up to the standards of a Scott Conant restaurant. My bf and I were seated and presented with the menus immediately. Our waters were filled and a wine menu was brought to the table. My bf decided to order the duck and foie gras ravioli with marsala reduction ($27) and I ordered the endive and apple salad with heirloom beets, gorgonzola cheese and candied walnuts ($17).   Once our orders were placed, the breadbasket was brought out. I truly appreciated the attention placed into informing the patrons on the different types of breads and dips. It was helpful because now I knew exactly what types of gourmet breads we would be feasting on! From what I can recall, I remember a small ciabatta, a piece of foccacia, and two breads with mozzarella and salami baked in. The breads were warm, and enclosed in a cloth napkin with another piece of traditional Italian bread placed atop it. The bread basket was divine and each piece of bread paired nicely with the soft, spreadable butter, salty eggplant spread and the citrus-infused olive oil dip. As a matter of fact, the bread was so good that I asked the server for another basket and that was brought out--only to be devoured again!   As for the entrees, the presentation was extremely beautiful for both dishes. The foie gras was plated on the plate with the marsala reduction drizzled beautifully over the top. The ravioli was plentiful and this surprised my bf since he was only expecting a handful of ravioli. My endive and beet salad was truly one of the most beautiful salads I've ever seen. The endives were sliced thinly and the bitter after taste of the endives paired quite nicely with the sweetness of the beets, apples and candied walnuts while the salty gorgonzola cheese bits added the necessary salty punch to the sweet and bitter.   The ambience was romantic, dim and quiet. My bf and I really enjoyed dinner that night. The overall price may not be cheap but for the quality of the food, it was well justified.   Bottom line: I would return for that breadbasket alone!",

I've seen Scott Conant on Chopped a hundred times and he always comes across as a little too full of himself, claiming to be the master of pasta.   With this in mind I was actually looking forward to criticizing his restaurant, but I just can't.    I ordered the creamy polenta appetizer and shared it with the table.  It was amazing, with the truffled mushrooms blending perfectly with the polenta whose \"creamy\" descriptor in the menu is both descriptive and right on.  I then ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli.  I thought it would be too rich, but the portion was just right and somehow, despite it being duck with foie gras, was not too rich.  The pasta was cooked perfectly... damn you Conant.    For dessert we had the Bombolini and the Strawberry Souffle, both were great, with the Bombolini being the favorite for the table.    The dinner was absolutely lovely and everything was very flavorful, in perfect portions and made just right.",

My boyfriend got the fillet which was of course delicious while I got the New York steak- it's massive! No side needed especially if you order an appetizer. The Primi Piatti are also large enough to serve as a main entree. Asked server her recommendation for the dessert she discussed what the most popular were and which her favorite was... the Bomboloni. Basically, donut holes infused with nutella or vanilla served with a banana gelato. DELICIOUS. The added bonus is definitely the view of the strip and the Bellagio fountaints. Cannot wait to go back!   Thank you Scarpetta for the amazing service and delicious food! Scott Conant- nicely done.",

    "text": "Romantic and Intimate, Scarpetta is definitely a date night spot... Not for a company dinner for twelve.  Since there were twelve of us, we were seated in a private room with a spectacular view of the Bellagio's fountain attraction.  As the sun went down, the room got really dark to a point where everyone was falling asleep...  The best way to describe the food here was \"comforting\".  The chef here definitely turns complicated Italian dishes to something very down-to-earth. My favorite dish of the night was the appetizer Scallops with Mushrooms.  The combination between the two was harmonious from taste to its texture.  My second favorite dish was Pancetta-wrapped veal loin.  I love veal, but I ordered this mainly for the side of sweetbread, peas and carrots.  I am HUGE on sweetbread since I have fallen in love with it at Animal in West LA.  Every since then, I have tried sweetbread whenever I see them on the menu, but this one was by far the WORST sweetbread side ever :(  The cripy frito misto appetizer was too salty and mushy.  Probably need higher heat to fry them...  I would definitely come back here again and try other dishes.  I have been here before and tried the duck and foie gras ravioli and black cod and they were both amazing!  The Aged sirloin beef here is very dry.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary with a romantic date night here.   The food and the service were both fantastic; however, we both were plagued with food poisoning that evening.  My episode kicked in about 2 hours after dinner and he was up all night super sick.    My disappointment doesn't lie in the fact that we were displeased with our meal or the service, but rather in the service I received the next morning when I called to let them know about our food poisoning.  The manager on the phone immediately became defensive instead of apologetic and told me that food poisoning does not kick in until 8 hours later and that it was probably something else we had eaten during the day.  Mind you... this was the only meal and time that my boyfriend had spent together all day.   I had also called only 30 minutes after they had opened for the evening and she told me that it couldn't have been the food because they didn't receive any other calls regarding any episodes of food poisoning and we ordered popular items on the menu.  (Braised short rib, chicken, and a pasta dish). I still can't believe that I had to justify our ill feelings with someone who showed no compassion and was challenging me on the authenticity of my statement.  She eventually transferred me to security to fill out a report.  Four days later im still waiting to hear back regarding some sort of follow up.    Never going here again.",

When we did get seated the view from our table was beautiful, we could see the water show that Bellagio does. Our waiter, can't remember his name was really attentive, asked us how we are doing, if there was anything else that he could get,  the staff kept our waters full AWESOME!!  Food here is pretty good. We all had different dishes amongst the 12 girls in the group.. That's how we eat LOL. Sharing is caring. Over all great place, great atmosphere, nice people, modern interior, beautiful views.",

    "text": "Fine dining at it's finest!  Came here a Saturday night during my last trip to Vegas for a bachelorette party (apparently we weren't the only ones) and we were seated right in the middle on a long table which was nice for a party of 7 girls. Our waiter and busers were on point and our waiter was really nice and always conversated with us and made our experience fab!  Let's talk about that bread basket...how crazy is it that they actually have salami in one of the breads. They also have sourdough and herb focaccia  . They have butter, olive oil and this roasted tomato eggplant as a spread to go with the variety of bread they give. I liked the herb focaccia bread the best with the butter...it was toasted and soft in a small square (good for portion size). For my meal I got the black cod with tomato's and fennel because I love butterfish and I only eat seafood and I love vegetables...although I was debating on getting this or the halibut, I'm glad I went with this because it was so divine! I wish the portion was bigger but it's one of those restaurants where it's quality over quantity. We ordered 2 whites and 1 bottle of reds that night, and because my stomach was not having it, I only drank a glass of the 1st bottle. Some of the girls ordered the lobster, scallop appetizers, split pea soup, foi Gras ravioli and steak and everyone said everything they ordered was great. For desserts we got the hazelnut mini donuts, strawberry cheesecake/shortcake in a cup dessert over a bed of crystallized sugar...I didn't get to try any of them but everything was all gone so it must've been delicious.   Overall the ambiance is beautiful, food is amazing/drinks and bread, awesome service and fine dining at it's finest. The portions are a little small and the price is a little pricey but worth it especially when it's a special occasion like a birthday, anniversary, valentines day, mothers day or bachelorette dinner =)",

    "text": "After reading all the great yelp reviews we picked this place for my wife's birthday. Here is your ex-elite yelp renegade review.  I hope it is good enough for you.  Our waiter helped with the wine list and led us in the right direction.  Huge win, you shouldn't have to study beforehand to be able to order wine.  The bread is in fact good. But remember when you review a restaurant that knowing the bread is good is not actionable info.  Actually by knowing this I ordered a strong drink knowing the bread could save me, so good tip.  The appetizers we had were rich, interesting that all of them looked rich. Polenta was good.  Crab corn chowder was great because it came as a plate of just crab - where's the chowder? They pour it on right in front of you, that's where. Fun and effective, lots of nice flavors all stood out. The appetizers were big.  So then we tried the spaghetti because of the yelp reviews. It's tomato basil sauce on spaghetti. Everyone who raves about it is questionable. Have you ever had spaghetti with tomato basil sauce before? It is like that but over twenty dollars. Ours was super salty which I didn't like. This dish would be chopped for sure.  We had two fish dishes both were pretty good but the fennel black cod was the best, cooked just through.  Dessert was 5 huge doughnut balls and really surprised me. Simple and delicious. They were perfectly done. Not a thing wrong. Super satisfying. Service had ramped back up for dessert.  The setting is sweet. Windows overlooking the bellagio fountains. Cool looking wine cellar. Plan your visit to be there through sunset as the strip lights come on.  It had a comfortable relaxed atmosphere but still classy.  We had a lot of fun.  I'd go again.",

There is a maximum seating capacity of 30 I believe and a minimum spend that must be met in food and beverage. There was 24 of us and two long tables were set up. We weren't crowded and had the right amount of room for us. Our menu was one we chose ahead of time and served family style except for our main which we chose there but served individually. We had a dedicated server by the name of Luis and he was amazing. Very attentive and always making sure dishes were cleared, water was filled, and drinks were topped up. Our starters were scallops, burrata salad and a wild mushroom truffled polenta. The scallops were cooked to perfection and fresh tasting, burrata salad was refreshing and the polenta was creamy and light tasting.  The pasta selection we had was tomatoe basil spaghetti, foie grois ravioli, and short rib angliotti. The tomatoe spaghetti was one of our favourite, the foie grois ravioli and the angliotti were also very good. I chose as a main black cod. It was so moist, flaky and cooked perfectly. I tried the tenderloin beef. So flavourful and tender. I wish I could've had more. The deserts were all good.",

I went here with a bachelorette group and it was a nice flashy restaurant to celebrate such an occasion.  The service was great, however, it did take some time for the server to get to us. They were hospitable and made sure everything was set in order for you. Their selection looked great. The dish I chose was $45 (Prime Beef whatever lol I'm not sure what the dish was called). It was tasty but small. I will admit, I like to enjoy my food but I do want some quantity in it as well. For that $45, I would be able to get a bigger piece of beef elsewhere, however, it wouldn't have been cooked by the famous chef and that restaurant. Sadly, I do not ever no who that is. HAHA! Nonetheless, the beef was amazing and tasted great. The side potatoes and mushrooms added flavor to the beef and mixed well.  When it comes to the drinks, I advise you just get it elsewhere. Small martinis or little drinks were $15+ and when it came to wine, just be careful with your wallet! Some bottles are worth over $1500! And that's wine that was bottled in 2002-2005! Just go to the nearest store and enjoy that Stella Rosa!",

    "text": "Damn this was such a good meal!  My friends and I dined here for Restaurant Week 2013 and all of us, but one, ordered off the Restaurant week menu.  It all began when I made reservations on Open Table, courtesy of the Yelp App on my iPhone.  I didnt have any preference of where we sat, but where the hostess sat us was remarkable!  We got a window seat facing the Bellagio, so not only did we enjoy a delicious meal, we also got to enjoy a fantastic view of the strip, the Bellagio, and also the Bellagio Fountain show all at once!  Now this was a meal to remember!  Service was top notch, there were no disappointments there; the waiter we had was very attentive and helpful in helping us make our selection from the menu.    Course 1: Braised beef short rib - very tender pieces of sliced beef on top of what they called a risotto (not the traditional type of risotto) but it was still delicious!  The \"Risotto\" was basically diced pieces of vegetables which supported the 3-4 pieces of beef on top.  Very good combination of flavors and textures.  Very impressed.    Before the second course came, we were all scarfing down their stromboli bread which is complimentary with our meal!  It came with other bread, which were not that memorable.  The bread was also served with three types of spreads, an eggplant marinara spread, olive oil, and something else I cannot remember. On a side note, one of my friends even asked the waiter to bring an entire basket filled with the bread, which he did!  That made her evening! haha.    Course 2: Jidori Chicken - Now I didn't know what a Jidori chicken was, so I asked the waiter.  This whole time, I thought it was the way the chicken was cooked!  But instead, it is the type of chicken used to make the chicken, like using kurabuta pork.  I can definitely tell the difference with kurabuta pork and regular pork, but this jidori chicken was a bit more difficult to tell the difference from regular chicken, besides the fact that this chicken was MOIST throughout!  Maybe that's what makes Jidori chicken so good?  Well, next time I will know! =D    Not only did I have the second course as my main meal, I HAD to try their handmade spaghetti everyone RAVES about!  So I ordered a dish for everyone to share!  In conclusion, it was pretty damn good.  What makes it good is the noodles!  The texture is not too over or undercooked, but just right!  I guess the handmade pasta really makes a difference in a pasta dish!    Course 3: Chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream - Now how can you end a meal without dessert!?  My stomach was SO distended PRIOR to the second course, but I had to taste everything!  By the time dessert came, I swear I have a second stomach!  I devoured not ONLY MY dessert, but my friends dessert too!  She ordered the stuffed donuts with nutella....what?! NUTELLA in fried dough?  Yes!  Nuff said. ;-)    I'd definitely come back to Scarpetta again!  Quite pricey for a student like myself, so probably come again with my family, during restaurant week, or when I start making the big bucks!",

I wanted to compare it to the other Italian restaurants in town. Scarpetta has a magnificent view, the customer service was excellent, and my Veal Chop Parmesan was not cooked thoroughly. We started our evening with some fresh oysters which were complemented well with a bottle of white wine. My guest had a chicken breast, and she said it was good. I brought my concern with Julian, my server and he did apologize on behalf of the restaurant's inconvenience. Julian brought my guest and I complementary dessert which we both enjoyed. Overall I think Scarpetta was excellent but I think the food at Nora's is far better tasting ( well at least the Veal). Scarpetta by far has the best view compared to the other Italian restaurants I've tried out in town. Would I come again? Probably. Did I get for what I pay for? Yes. Is, is the best Italian restaurant in Las Vegas? It has potential!",

This trip we decided Scarpetta at the Cosmo, Prime at the Bellagio and Gordon Ramsays Steak at Paris.  we order the coli flour soup without the rabbit for my 6 year old  2 orders of the scallops with Foie Gras for all of us to share  Let me say the bread baskets and especially the eggplant dish they bring with it is absolutely amazing. so back to the scallops and Foie Gras, perfectly cooked and delicious the poached pears went with the Foie Gras better than anything I have ever tasted.  Next our side dishes fingerling potatoes were magnificent perfectly seasoned and cooked just right the Brussels sprouts in creamed Pancietta and fuji apples was to die for, How do you make Brussels Sprouts taste so good?  Our main courses Lobster Pici for my daughter, she mainly picked at the lobster  I had the Foie Gras Ravioli  my wife had the newest item called  TAGLIATELLE  that could have been the best of the best pork cheeks in a delicious pasta with an alfredo like cream sauce over it.  As I said, we eat at some of the finest restaurants in vegas, and for the 3rd trip in a row, we find ourselves still discussing Scarpetta  the least expensive of the wonderful places we ate at is the one we cant wait to get back to. Mr. Scott Conant, You sir are a PASTA GOD Our Bill at Prime was 420.00 + tip Our Bill at Gordon Ramsays was 360.00 + tip Our Bill at Scarpetta 230.00 + tip and this is where we were satisfied more than any other place.",

I cannot recommend the spaghetti marinara strongly enough. The rest of the food we ordered was great-- but this is just the perfect bowl of pasta.  Having said that-- the NYC restaurant had superior service. They were busy, but it seemed like our waiter, who had our table first, had about 5 other tables sit down at the exact same time after us-- so our service was quite slow. (although, still very friendly). I think that is way more the problem of management to sit 5 tables in one waiters section all at once. I felt like it took at least 20 minutes to flag down the waiter to get our check delivered to us.  Again-- food was great, service was slow because it was so crowded... they should do something to rectify that situation.",

For the main dish I kept it simple and ordered the spaghetti (something I never order in restaurants). The pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was PERFECT and clung perfectly to the noodles, and the basil tasted like it was just picked.  Also, the view was absolutely amazing. We got a table right next to the window and overlooked our hotel (the Bellagio), the fountains, and part of the strip. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant was also intimate and gorgeous. My friends and I didn't have to shout to hear each other.  Overall, amazing meal.",

Full body tomato basil sauce and impeccably crafted pasta so delicious you'll never look at spaghetti the same again. The rib cap was described as \"the best thing I've ever eaten\" by my husband. So, if you are unsure of what to order, the rib cap is a must. My sister has a severe gluten allergy and struggles to find any restaurant that not only understands the risk of cross contamination but offers an entire menu of gluten free options. She was she able to order gluten free pasta and said it was incredibly delicious. No easy feat when making any dish, let alone pasta ,for such an allergy. Not only is scarpetta accommodating and inviting but the dishes are made with unbelievable skill by chefs who are truly passionate about their craft. Bravo!",

We came here to celebrate two birthdays the other day and the service, like last time, was awesome. Everybody thoroughly enjoyed their food and had ZERO complaints! We had a party of 8 and there were a few picky eaters amongst us and seriously everybody LOVED their food! I ordered the scallop with foie gras for an appetizer, lamb for the main course, and this guava soup thing with pineapples for dessert. Scallops were AMAZING and probably my favorite part of the whole meal. The lamb was different than the last time I had it but still good. The guava soup (per our waiter's suggestion) was light and refreshing...so good.  I whole heartedly recommend this place to everybody who wants to have a great meal and a great dining experience",

Our table was by the window over looking the Bellagio. We had the perfect view of their water show. We asked our server what his favorite items are on the menu and he has excellent taste!

The staff truly makes the dining experience and we felt utterly pampered. Honestly, they would have fed us by hand had we asked.   The dinner bread was FANTASTIC.

Like Rao's, it's all about the ingredients. The pasta itself has such a consistency and texture that you want to chew each mouthful until it's too fine to chew anymore. I could have downed another plate (just not at $25).  Oh: The tuna \"roll\" appetizer is delish, too.",

When asked they were barely able to name the wine or the reason for the pairing.  Severely disappointed overall.  I will give credit to the waiter however.  After about the 3rd or 4th pairing he started sharing his choices for wines and they were better than the choices on the list by far.  I hate ever giving bad reviews, but this one was bad overall.

I'm astute in the world of culinary arts and have a high appreciation for an incredible meal and the impact that good service and ambiance can have on an evening out.  I also enjoy basic Italian comfort food at times and that's what I happened to be craving on this particular occasion. I found the best of both worlds at Scott Conant's Las Vegas masterpiece. With that being said... We had a slight misunderstanding when we arrived regarding the reservation and our seating preference. The manager was professional enough to minimize any anxieties and made sure we felt that it would be worked out immediately. She sat my wife and I at the bar and proceeded to make us two complimentary cocktails - herself! They were outstanding BTW.  We were seated at the window and enjoyed the Bellagio water show in the backdrop.  The food... it was absolutely the most incredible dinning experience I have had in the last 10 years. We had some of everything on the menu...  It was the equivalent to exquisite gourmet comfort food porn. The wine list is stellar and the service I received was impeccable and personable.  Our server was outstanding - DO NOT believe any negative hype about this restaurant. This is a must for anyone wanting to venture and try something new - Scarpetta will not disappoint.",

    "text": "I had heard about Scarpetta multiple times on Travel Channel (Anthony Bourdain) and Food Network (Best Thing I ever Ate).  Scott Conant is also a celebrity chef that is on some Food Network shows.  I happened to be at a conference at the Cosmopolitan (my new favorite hotel in Vegas, BTW), and I figured I might as well stop by and try out the food at Scarpetta.  The inside of the restaurant has a good view of the faux lake at the Bellagio.  Big windows and a nice decor are the first thing you notice.  The food is what we were really there for, so I was excited about that.  For appetizer, we ordered duck and foie gras ravioli's with a wine reduction sauce.  This was just amazing....heavy and rich, but it is foie gras, so you should expect that.  Since it was a regular menu item and not an appetizer, they split it in half for my co-worker and I.  Upon receiving the raviolis, our server (who was very good....attentive and knowledgable) brought over a basket of 3 breads.  One was ciabatta, one was a focaccia (or something similar) with pork (prosciutto, maybe?) and cheese rolled into it.  I can't remember the third bread, but it was also good.  Next up was the main meal.  I ordered the spaghetti (with tomato and basil), and my co-worker ordered the branzino.  The spaghetti is what I had seen featured multiple times on TV, and I am always a skeptic.  I didn't think it could possibly be the best spaghetti I had ever had, but I was wrong.  This spaghetti was the absolute best I have ever had.  There was so much flavor concentrated on FRESH pasta.  Every bite was heaven, and for $24, I would order it again for sure.  Vegas (and NY) are both expensive for nice restaurants, so the price tag is high compared to your local favorite Italian place, but the pasta just isn't the same.  My co-workers branzino was also excellent.  Served with some greens and onion, it was cooked perfectly (crispy skin), and the flavor was very fresh.    I can't say enough about this restaurant.  I highly recommend anyone going to the Cosmopolitan check this place out.  Definitely one of my better dining experiences for Italian food.",

    "text": "So much potential here, the experience was really 3 star but I'm optimistic.  Great layout with large S-curved bank seating and a nice north facing view of the Bellagio fountain. Service is great but the kitchen timing needs work. Food came out a bit slow and a bit cold which is normally a big time no-no but they are new and working out the kinks.  Food is delicious, apps of short ribs and polenta truffles with mushrooms make for a great start. Polenta was creamy and truffle accents were spot on.   Pastas are house-made and cooked just al-dente. Easy to do but somehow few places get it right. The spaghetti with creamy tomato and basil, just perfect, a great representation of Italian food in its simplistic goodness. Black cod done well, cooked nicely.   Duck and foie gras ravioli was a bit salty and cold and the agnolotti seemed too one dimensional. Both were slightly warm and would have been better paired with a side. Plates seemed a bit bare.  Desserts-  very creative. Napoleon-  deconstructed creme brulee with blood oranges, sweet and creamy, amazing combination.   Nutella warm molten chocolate bites with hazelnuts were also deliciously comforting.   Overall, given the lack of decent Italian eateries with value on the Strip, it's worth a visit. Once they get the timing down, the kitchen and the service make this a sure-bet for a quality meal.",

Everything we ate was really good, but the service was terrible.  We could never get the waiters attention for anything we needed.  Maybe it was because we were part of a big group, and the gratuity was included, but we had to flag someone down to order, we received the wrong dishes and drinks, charged us for a dessert for a birthday.  Who does that?",

The bread basket is delightful with the trio of accompaniments: marscapone butter, Eggplant in tomato ragu and citrus infused oil.  For appetizer we had the creamy polenta. Enough for one or two to share as it is extremely rich as a separate duo of perfectly creamed polenta and truffled mushrooms. If you haven't already gobbled up your breads, make useful tool to sweep up the last juices. Three of us got the black cod which is superbly moist and light with a crisp skin, but the vegetables (fennel/peppers) were a bit too sour to match with.  And the other three got the duck foie gras ravioli which was rich and poignant with flavor but not unpleasant. The balsamic glaze was apparent and not overwhelming. I would have finished the entire plate.    Why the three stars? LACK of consistent service :( I don't include the guy who kept our water glasses filled. But we were all (party of 6) sourly disappointed with the main waiter. He only presented himself to take our order and serve the appetizer.  Didn't even refilled our breads as asked.  Then with empty plates, we all sat there for 15 minutes watching our server chummy up with a table of 3 girls and another table drinking it up with ample wine bottles. An assistant manager in a suit, bless him, came over, asked how our dinner was, saw our plates and decided to clear our table himself and also bring us our check. Although we weren't completely dissatisfied with the whole dining experience, it's just unsettling when the server is MIA with you and present elsewhere.  So, maybe next time. If there is a next time.",

He really knew the menu well and could give reccomendations with amazing detail.  I loved the staff here.  No joke, that bread basket with trio of citrus infused olive oil, eggplant spread and mascarpone butter...is to die for!  I could live off the stromboli filled with salami and smoked mozzarella.  So delicious.  As a starter, I tried the Raw Yellowtail.  The presentation was simple and clean with four thin slices of yellowtail topped with olio di zenzero, microgreens and sea salt.  It was so simple but you could taste the freshness.  For my next course, I ordered the Short Rib Agnolloti.  Perfection.  The brown butter and horseradish sauce was flavorful and had the right amount of kick to pull the dish together.  It was a very small portion but was perfect for a light dinner before going out.  My friends ordered the Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil, Black Tagliolini, and Orata Rossa.  They all enjoyed their meals and the experience at Scarpetta.  Our amazing waiter Matt, surprised our table with a birthday plate of an assortment of Italian cookies which were an amazing finish to a great meal.  Great ambiance, view of the Bellagio fountain, service, food...overall an amazing dinner!!",

All in, for spaghetti and meatballs, mixed green salad and glass of house wine, our bill for 2 people was $ 170. I live in LA so I'm used to paying a lot to eat out, but this meal wasn't worth it.

The bread was excellent and I usually don't like bread at Italian restaurants.  They had a focaccia, ciabiata, standard loaf, and crazy one with meat in it.  As a vegetarian I had the first 3.  In addition there were 3 dips - an amazing butter, a eggplant option, and citrus infused EVOO.  I began with the white artichoke soup.  Great presentation.  Mushrooms and croutons with a nice foam and greens, then came the creamy artichoke soup.  Cleaned the bowl.  Then the famed spaghetti.  The $24 spaghetti that apparently is amazing.  I had to find out for myself.  I hadn't ordered spaghetti from an Italian restaurant in a decade (in high school I'd order it on dates to save money).  It was honestly - ok.  I found mine to be too al dente, but perhaps this is personal taste and preference.  Still good pasta - but don't feel like you have to get the spaghetti.  The service was great.  The waiter was quick, knowledgable, and professional.  The manager came over and chatted with me for 15 minutes which was great.  They sat me at the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains - can't complain about that.  Go here.  So you can say you ate at Scott's place and because it's delicious.",

First, I definitely would request a window view of the Bellagio water show if you can, because my boyfriend and I saw three shows while enjoying our dinner. Scarpetta's very romantic but is also just a great place for a one-of-a-kind Italian meal.   We started out with sharing a glass of Pinot Noir, which was delicious and smooth. For an appetizer, I highly recommend the creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms...then you must dip the bread they give you into the mushroom mixture. Deliciouso! I ordered the simple, but unforgettable Tomato and Basil Spaghetti and my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Agnolotti, which he devoured. All their pasta is made fresh at the restaurant and can't be compared to any other pasta I've had. You must try it for yourself!  Reservations can be made online, and I definitely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Las Vegas with their significant other or wants to make a good first impression :)",

The duck and foie gras ravioli is their signature dish and reasonably so. It's amazing. Delicate and refined is probably the best way to describe it.   Colorado Lamb was amazing. The lamb was not gamey at all and the different components of the dish worked in harmony. I will admit that I still like the Colorado Lamb from Stage restaurant in Honolulu...  I remember one of my friends having a really delicious pasta (mint infused?) but I can't remember all the details regarding it. I just remembered it was heavenly.   Strawberry souffle was amazing. Light, aromatic, and slightly sweet. It blew my socks off and definitely put Maison Akira's souffle to shame.   Zeppole are AHH-MAYYY-ZIING. Deep fried dough nuggets (so light and airy!) filled with a rich nutella center. Even if you're full, you need to get these...or you will regret it forever.   Definitely a great place to hit up for a bite to eat when you're in Vegas. I definitely will be returning during my next trip!",

Appetizer: Short Rib Risotto- Good. Nothing more nothing less. Entrees: Agnolotti was okay. The \"brown butter\" in the description got me hoping for The Old Spaghetti Factory's Brown Butter Mizithra dish, but it was nothing like it. Rich, but not salty. And I like salty/savory. Best part was the crispy/crunchy texture in some bites. Hubs got the tried and True spaghetti. He liked it a lot. Noodles cooked truly al dente. Again, not as savory as I like, but... satisfied with the quality. I like super bold and flavorful dishes. This is definitely a restaurant for those with a more \"refined\" palate. Drinks: A greenish martini with a basil leaf in it, I forget the name- refreshing. Two dirty gin martinis- strong and actually dirty. Two Macalllan 12s. Total bill before tip: $180. Probably won't come back with all the options Vegas has to offer, but 4 stars because there's no denying it IS a nice restaurant if that's your type of thing. :)",

Conant's sense of `new Italian' cooking is also different from Mario, who, with his love of ramps (a type of leek).  Scott sees himself as adapting the Italian concentration on local ingredients with those ingredients which are local to the farms.   I started out with the Mussels and Asparagus Soup was hearty which a nice assortments of spring veggies. The polenta with a fricassee of truffled mushrooms was as usual excellent and the Grilled Bread and Goat Cheese Salad were also great starters.  The boneless Osso Busco with orzo pasta was phenomenal.  It was braised in a boldly flavored sauce.    The spaghetti with tomato and basil seems simple but delicious, a must-try!

However, there is a large bar that extends the entire window so it perfectly blocks your view if you sit beside the window.  Why the designer would not just put floor to ceiling windows, thereby providing an uninterrupted view is beyond me.",

    "text": "A lovely dining experience! Very attentive service and great ambiance (we had a window seat overlooking the Bellagio fountain). The best part of our meal were the appetizers- we had the butter poached lobster chestnut and parsnip soup and the creamy polenta. The flavours on both soup and polenta were amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly and I love the toasted almonds in there. The polenta was so smooth and the truffle flavour was present but not overwhelming.  We also really enjoyed the complimentary breads and tapenade. One of the best tapenade I have ever had. Perfect with the bread.  Entree is where they loose one star. My husband and I shared a veggie tagliatelli. The noodle was cooked perfect but the sauce was too salty. We also had 3 sides- mushroom medley, cauliflowers and butternut squash. The squash was too sweet and could have been roasted a bit more. The raisin and pine nuts in the cauliflower had a clash of flavours. The mushrooms were good but nothing too special. I was expecting something a little outside of the box than just sauteed mushrooms. Overall a great experience!",

As per usual in Vegas we were late after the show ( over 30 min) however they accommodated us very quickly on the Windows over looking the The fountains at Bellagio. The food was good, Italian, small plates. The desert was good and they had a good wine list. Pricy however it's Vegas. I would recommend this place next time you are in Vegas, great staff and great service.",

Despite showing up almost 45 minutes before our reservation time, the maitre d' found a table for us quickly, fulfilling our request for a quiet table as we were celebrating a special occasion.  We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Service was excellent as well.  Unlike our dinner at a different restaurant the next night, we weren't constantly interrupted by an over eager waiter.  Our needs were met at the appropriate time but we were allowed the time to enjoy our meals.  Our waiter's recommendation of the Spaghetti was spot on, the house made pasta was perfect, and my wife loved the tagliatelle.  Next time we're in Vegas we'll definitely be going back.",

There was an assortment of breads that were warm and delicious: focaccia with rosemary, one with mozarella baked into it, one with salami, one with a leafy green in it, and bite-sized one that were crunchy. The bread comes with softened butter (it was so soft), an eggplant tomato sauce, and an olive oil-based dip.  -Duck and foie gras ravioli: It was delicious. It was plentiful and full of flavor. -Endive salad with beets: My gf really enjoyed this. It was presented very well. It had a nice, slightly bitter taste that was well-complimented by the sweetness of the beets that were on the side.",

For dinner, I got the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti. It was heaven on earth! Such a fresh and flavorful dish. And it was perfectly portioned! I don't remember the names of any of the drinks, but they were delicious and had fresh fruit as well!

The sear and crust on the outside of the beef was seasoned just right with a nice crunch which goes very well with the soft and tender wagyu beef. It was definitely one of the best wagyu beef I've tasted. $70 Dessert:  We shared the Nutella Bomboloni with homemade banana Gelato (so soft with a slight chewy to the fried bomboloni) $12  It's a must try!

I liked all 3 dishes - Even though you can't really taste the foie in the ravioli. The waiter told me they normally have a seared foie in the fall, but this year it wasn't here yet in october =( sad times. The mushrooms were really good! and I liked the black taliolini a little more than the ravioli. Overall, a great experience at a fairly reasonable price for vegas standards.",

    "text": "Scott Conant's Scarpetta boasts lavish, dimly lit and woody decor, complete with a view overlooking the Bellagio fountains from the Cosmopolitan. Be sure to make a reservation and if there are only 2 of you dining, request to sit by the window. All of the staff are well-trained and highly professional, delivering an upscale dining experience from start to finish.   My sister and I came for a quick dinner before the club and didn't want to get too full, so we only indulged in the starter bread and 1 entree each. The bread basket is exquisite and features 1 piece each of Sourdough, Ciabbata, a salami Stromboli, broccoli Stromboli, and another that I cannot remember. It is accompanied by a white wine olive oil, mascarpone butter, and some type of tapenade.   I ordered the famous Spaghetti. As far as I know, this dish only contains 3 ingredients. Noodles, tomato sauce, basil. Yes, the noodles were a perfect al-dente with just a little bite to them. Yes the sauce was fresh and light, sticking to each noodle. Was this worth $24? No. For only $2 more (and more deserving of the price tag), my sister went with the Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli. The ravioli was optimally thin and there was almost no sauce, making the meat the star. It was a rich dish and could easily be shared if you're also getting an appetizer.     I'm happy to have had my Scarpetta experience and I enjoyed the food and the ambiance, but I don't see any need to come back here for the $24 spaghetti, which is why I settled on 4 stars.",

    "text": "Came to Scarpetta for an anniversary dinner in February with much excitement after having learned about Scott Conant and his signature dish that shook the culinary world at one point.   Arrival: We arrived around 7pm and was quickly greeted by the bartender as the hostess was busy seating someone and she was able to smoothly check us in just as the hostess arrived (Both wished us a Happy Anniversary) to walk us to the table. The restaurant itself is dark while the interior modern yet, still upholding the flair of traditional Italian restaurants seen with the white cloths over the tables. We were disappointed that we weren't able to get a seat right by the window but was instead placed awkwardly in the middle. Luckily our server happily obliged to moving us next to a window seat just as a party of two was leaving and his team quickly whisked us and our waters over.  cia Service: Our server was friendly and attentive and had a great feel for what type of guest we were. He never pushed items and would passionately explain various items that we had questions on in detail and gave a brief history of certain items that were famous at Scarpetta. He also greeted us a Happy Anniversary and provided a great wine recommendation that my girlfriend loved and the best part is it wasn't the most expensive one but actually matched her description of what she wanted. He was there when we needed him but he also knew when to give us our space so we could enjoy our time with each other. Overall great service all around from our server and his whole team. Also convinced he had a part in convincing the pastry chef for some extra Bomboloni for our anniversary which is an added bonus.   Food: The best way to enjoy Scarpetta in my opinion is to keep it simple. We found that the dishes we enjoyed more were the simple ones. We started with the complimentary bread which was a variety and came with three different types of sauces which provided a different flair then the typical olive oil and Vinegar (Which is great).   Starter: Creamy Polenta, we chose this dish based off the recommendation of our server and his explanation that this was one of Conant's more famous dishes. The polenta was rich and provided a feeling of comfort with every spoonful and even more when we dipped our bread in it.   Entree: Lobster Pici x Spaghetti. My girlfriend got the pici while I went with Conant's most famous dish and crown jewel his simple spaghetti with Tomato and Basil. The magic in the dish is in the noodles itself. I'm a fan of thick noodles and the spaghetti is the perfect amount where it's not too hard but not extremely soft. You can taste the difference in the handmade noodle compared to many other places. Sometimes it's hard for me to go back to eating regular spaghetti after Scarpetta. The tomato and basil sauce is light and not heavy complementing but putting the texture and flavor of the spaghetti in the forefront. Such a simple dish yet just right. My only wish was for the portions to be more but it would take away from the experience. The lobster pici was also delicious but was a stark contrast to the spaghetti as the sauce was more powerful and the addition of lobster helped make the dish more intricate and intense. The touch of almonds gave the dish an interesting crunch as well. We switched dishes a couple times and in the end we both agreed the Spaghetti was our favorite.   Dessert: Crema Bruciatti x Nutella and Vanilla Bomboloni. The Crema Bruciatti although good wasn't anything impressive and easily forgettable. The Bomboloni on the other hand is the ultimate guilty pleasure (Insane sugar rush as well). The warm nutella inside the sugary exterior coupled with rich vanilla ice cream inside of each Bomboloni is happiness in every bite and regret later on when stepping on the scale. Definitely worth it and the standard amount of pieces is more than enough.   Thoughts: Our whole experience at Scarpetta could be described as less is more. The simple dishes is what won us over. Our service was attentive when needed but gone to leave us in our own world when it was time. Although we didn't try alot of other dishes on the menu which I'm sure is good we came for the pasta which should be the main focus when coming to a place like this. The dark modern atmosphere provided a great date night as we talked and watched the Bellagio fountains going on in the distance with the entire strip glowing beneath our feet. This is definitely somewhere where you can take someone special as the food is comforting and atmosphere intimate.",

    "text": "Before I went there I had read a few yelp reviews and I have to say that I expected something more. Not that it's a bad place, just nothing to write home about.  The interior is very classy and elegant - dark wood, candles and comfortable white couches. The light is soft and dimmed, so it's a perfect spot for romantic, candlelit dinners. As in the majority of such sophisticated Italian restaurants the menu is very short and well-considered. There is no banality there, the flavors are mixed in surprising, interesting ways - you can see that the chef wanted to do something different. They also have a lot of vegetarian and gluten free dishes, which is not so common. The waiter was very professional and knew exactly when the food should be served or taken from the table. He also recommended great drinks and desserts.  The bread they serve as a apetizer is fresh, soft and savoury - delicious. For a main course I decided to try short rib agnolotti with brown butter, horseradish & toasted breadcrumbs. It tasted good, but was a bit on a small side and left me still hungry. My friends' portions were a bit bigger and they were satisfied with the flavors. The really good part were the desserts, we ordered mascarpone cheescake and banana souffle. They were perfect, not as heavy or as sweet as I though. The Berry Smash was also great! I had a few and I have to say there is waaaaaay more alcohol there than in Poland, where I live. It's easy to get tipsy.  So why only an \"ok\" grade? The prices are pretty high and the food is just ok. The concept itself may be interesting but the result is no so great as to overpay. There is probably a lot of Italian restaurants which are just as good or maybe even better.",

The polenta was okay and the ravioli was honestly the best ravioli I had ever eaten. The environment was cool and intimate. We sat in a very secluded booth, which there are about 8 in a row like that. There was a table there too that overlooked the bellagio fountains which would've been neat to sit at with a bigger party. Our drinks were okay and I don't even remember what they were, but there were just three to choose from.   Overall a cool environment to experience and get some good food and okay drinks for a decent price. And you get to walk through the cosmopolitan which is neat. Would recommend.",

    "text": "My husband and I had a mixed experience here: I really liked it, but he didn't. We came without reservations on a Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately and had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. The tables felt a bit close together, and it was very easy to hear conversations at other tables and difficult to block them out. It was also extremely dark; so dark that the man next to me had to use the flashlight on his iPhone to see and pay his bill haha  For food, we clearly had the bread basket, which was a little large for two people but tasty. We probably left about two-thirds of it untouched for fear of getting full before our main courses. I ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli, which was excellent. It was tasty and fun and inventive, and I've never really had anything like it. The filling was salty (in a good way) and paired very well with the marsala reduction, which was a bit sweet. My husband ordered the veal chop parmigiano, which he was pretty underwhelmed by. He grew up in Germany eating tons of veal, and he said that the quality just wasn't there for the price. For dessert, we split the nutella and vanilla bombolinis, which are basically donuts, and boy, were they yummy!   Service was pretty mediocre. While our server was perfectly friendly, he seemed really stressed. He had to run around to stay on top of things, and he sort of dropped/slammed our stuff onto the table and took off in a hurry.",

Their panna cotta taught me what the gold standard should be. Imagine the excitement I had in bringing my in laws to the Vegas location.   Our dining experience certainly did not disappoint. It was definitely all of my family's fav on this trip!   Short rib agnolotti, spaghetti and meatballs, uni black tagliolini, duck and foie gras ravioli, and Branzino - every dish was beyond delicious! Our table couldn't get enough.   My personal fav is still and will always be their mushroom and polenta. I don't understand why they don't just offer a full entree portion! I can eat a whole bucket worth - so so so so good.   Desserts - I had three baskets worth of Stromboli swimming in my stomach by this point (along with their polenta and whole plate of duck, foie gras ravioli) but I just couldn't refuse their dessert menu. Coconut souffle (so airy!), cheesecake (decadent!), donuts (bursting with heavenly Nutella and banana cream), and chocolate cake (brownie like exterior - very rich and perfect for all chocolate lovers) - no options can go wrong.   Overall - all around 5 stars! Foods, services, ambiance! Would be back every time we visit Vegas!",

The concierge at The Cosmopolitan had told us they open at 5:30, their website says 5:30, this yelp page says 5:30. The girl I interacted with was short in tone, condescending, slammed the door on us and in no way helpful or apologetic. Since we had a show to get to at 7, we didn't stay and wait for them to let us in at 6. She wasn't just rude to me, she was rude to an entire family waiting as well.  I was really looking forward to finally trying this place. I come to Vegas often and I can say I won't ever give this place a try again. Horrible customer service.",

I don't have to go on and on about the spaghetti again but seriously. Get it. You won't regret it.  My husband also got a filet that was one of the best cooked filets I've ever had. It was also served with this amazing swiss chard and onion that had this bright acidity that really balanced the steak well.  Crudos are tasty as well.  dessert we had the Bomboloni and the Budino.

The lighting is very dim so be prepared to look closely at your menu. As for the food, the portion sizes for the apps were good for 2 or more to share if you wanted to go that way. Beef carpaccio was excellent and the polenta is a must get, might not want to share that one. The octopus was ok but not fantastic with lots of beans. Another must get dish is the spaghetti, simple yet stunning. You can add meatballs if you wish but this is just some good old fashioned spaghetti with freshly made pasta.  For dessert the best thing to share is the budino, but the souffle was also really great. The price is a little high so value might be in question but there is no doubt the food quality is off the charts.   4.5 stars",

    "text": "Wow...... just wow. I can't believe after all these years of coming to Vegas, I missed a place as sexually pretentious yummy as Scarpetta.   Cosmopolitan Hotel is known as the place to see and be seen, and Scarpetta fits the bill as a place to eat sexy, while looking sexy. Like all key restaurants in the Cosmo, I don't consider anyone of them above a 4-star rating, so giving them 4-stars, means that it's among the best that this hotel offers.   You absolutely MUST try their tomato basil spaghetti. Cooked to al dente perfection, I was simply amazed that I was able to find anywhere. If you're a foie gras fan, this is one of the few places in town that does it beyond right, including their foie gras ravioli. Their branzino is perfection.  But beyond these dishes, I wasn't overly impressed. Everything else seemed decent, but nothing amazing to the point of worthy mention.  Dessert was excellent though, so you definitely don't want to miss that if you have a sweet tooth. I highly recommend the panna cotta.   Atmosphere is where I deduct a star. It's a bit too pretentious and dark for me. It's almost like I took a step back in time to a freak-sex club in the 70s. Think Studio 54 that reincarnated as an Italian restaurant, and you've found Scarpetta. It has an annoying level of pretentiousness, so the only way I'd come back is if I return with a group of people.",

Again, not disappointed. Just as good as I remembered years ago, except this time, I had a way better table than the last time. We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio water show, which went off like 3 times while we were there. Service was great, my friend got a paper cut from flipping the menu pages(SMH) and the busser ran all over kingdom come to find her a band-aid. I also had an incident where I was sipping my cocktail and something kept touching my upper lip every time I took a sip. Turns out there was a long blonde hair on the rim and I have black hair so I knew for sure it wasn't mine. Not gonna lie, took quite a bit of effort to hold back my gag reflex! I notified the waiter and he said \"oh, that's not good\", asked if I wanted a new one, and brought out a new one for me. I ordered the Risotto of the Day which was a saffron and bay shrimp, it was good, but I actually enjoyed my friends' dishes much more. one of them ordered the lamb Tagliatelle with truffled burrata! Soooo good! and the other one ordered short rib agnolotti, also very good. Overall, good dinner. Would come back the next time I'm in Vegas, and without a blonde hair in my drink hopefully.",

    "text": "Having been to the Scarpetta in NYC a few times we knew of the restaurant quality. The Las Vegas location did not disappoint in terms of food, service or ambiance. Our table overlooking the Bellagio fountains was spectacular. The caponata which is brought out with the bread basket is truly amazing. For appetizer, the Spaghetti was incomparable. It may seem too basic to order Spaghetti at an upscale, inventive restaurant but if you love house made pasta just do it! Their recipe is beyond fantastic and the dish is simply heaven.   For entree, we ordered a mezzaluna pasta which was one of the specials and probably one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. The pasta was stuffed with, if I remember correctly, goat cheese and spinach, topped with a light sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes, fried basil and ricotta salata. For desert, we opted for the classic Tiramisu cakes and it came with coffee gelato. The lady fingers were well soaked in kahlua and it tasted great.  Just a suggestion: The wine list is huge and has a very large selection but be careful, there are some very expensive bottles of wine on that list. I would recommend, if you are not a wine expert, telling the sommelier your preferred price point and types of wine you enjoy and asking him or her to make a selection. On this visit, we enjoyed a very nice Malbec after informing the sommelier of our tastes and food we had ordered from the menu.  Over all, the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the staff did a great job throughout our dinner. They brought out the bread basket and described the different types of bread. They answered all our questions about the menu and were very attentive. The whole experience at Scarpetta was wonderful and I look forward to returning again on my next trip to Vegas in few months.",

    "text": "I had wanted to dine at Scarpetta since I first laid eyes on Scott Conant via Chopped. The man is downright foxy. My favorite food happens to be pasta too, so clearly it was meant to be.   Located in the swanky Cosmopolitan hotel, the first thing you see are cascades of chandeliers and purple backlights throughout the main floor. The restaurant itself is dimly lit with lots of stone and dark accents creating a chic yet inviting space.   I suggest making reservations (we did so through Open Table) and also be sure to ask for a window table if available. Those have a clear view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Sadly they were all taken the night we went, but they sat us as close as they could so we still had a nice view from our seats.   They start your meal off with a complimentary bread basket, and we enjoyed the variety of it. There was sourdough, a rosemary focaccia, I believe a wheat of some kind, and two which were stuffed with goodness including pesto and cheese. Spread on some mascarpone butter or dunk in the citrus olive oil and it completely elevates it to another level.   My husband couldn't help himself and ordered another after we devoured it. They obliged, but seemed surprised by the request. I'm guessing not many people ask for refills. We are carb people, what can we say?   I knew ahead of time I would be ordering the $24 plate of tomato and basil spaghetti, and it was worth every penny. I'm almost certain I read he doesn't use cream in the sauce, but he sure fooled me because it was deliciously silky. When they set our plates down they removed a lid which had sealed in steam to keep the pasta fresh, and the aroma automatically made us salivate. It was the sexiest plate of pasta I had ever seen and tasted in my life.   My husband opted for a vegetable pasta which came dressed in a luxurious truffle zabaglione. When it comes to Italian food he almost always picks a meat dish over pasta, but he ate every last bite.   Our dinner was simply impeccable. My expectations were well exceeded and I cannot wait to make a return visit. The staff are wonderfully hospitable and helped make our evening that much more enjoyable.",

Our party tried a broad range of dishes and enjoyed them all: halibut, short ribs, pici, the special risotto (mushroom), asparagus, the special salad, and the black cod. We were on a limited business budget so scaled back the wine more than normal- the sommelier recommended a fabulous wine, very reasonably priced.   Would have loved to try their wine paired menu, but the entire table needs to participate. Something to look forward to next time we are in Vegas.",

The bread basket, polenta, and salted caramel budino were great, but for my entree, I ordered the pici and it wasn't worth the price or the recommendation by our waiter. I also docked a star because my mom and I were just so lucky to sit next to a couple that seem to be regulars at this restaurant. our server prioritized them all evening forcing my mom and I to feel nothing but second rate. maybe we should have talked about charities and unicorn wine, think that would have given us better service?",

    "text": "I actually chose to visit Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas because of a recommendation by podcaster and comedian Mark Maron. On his podcast WTF, Maron raved about the spaghetti at Scarpetta. To paraphrase, he described it as very simple, but incredibly well prepared.  Maron was correct. This was without a doubt the best spaghetti I have ever had. In the spirit of full disclosure, I must admit that the spaghetti is by no means cheap. Mine was $24. It was worth it, but to put in perspective, imagine how much spaghetti you could purchase at a grocery store for $24. It would feed you for a very long time. However, if there is such thing as spaghetti worth $24, this is it. I also added meatballs to my spaghetti for an additional eight dollars. I would recommend against doing this. The meatballs were numerous but smaller than the size of grapes. They were tasty, but did not add enough to the overall experience to justify the additional cost. Service was impeccable and the view of the Bellagio fountains from our table was a lovely touch.  Bread selections were also excellent. And we ended the night with a terrific dessert called bombolonis. Scarpetta is an expensive night out, but well worth it.",

You get tons of food and you can get wine with it as well and their wine selection is amazing.  It is your classic Italian restaurant so you know what you are walking into.  They  have amazing service from their waiters/waitresses to their sommelier.  Their sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and very professional.  Everyone makes you feel right at home and the food is amazing as I have already said.

    "text": "The food was delicious but the negative service completely ruined the entire experience. When calling to make the reservations for our large party, we specifically asked twice to confirm they could do separate checks (this was a determining factor for booking), they said absolutely so we booked. It was our friend's 30th birthday, the food looked great, and we were looking forward to a good night out. While the server was taking our initial drink order (middle aged bald gentleman- describing since I forget his name), I reminded him that we'd like separate checks. Figured it was easiest to let him know as soon as possible so we could stay organized from the get-go. He lets out a big obvious sigh and says, \"No, I'll have to bring a pen and paper over at the end and you guys will have to write it all out.\" Throughout dinner the service was very spotty. The first couple passes he made to check on us were well-timed but then after that there were big lulls in check-ins so several of us were waiting with empty drinks for long stretches of time, and the actual dinner took forever as well... if your kitchen needs some extra time to get out a large order then at least keep us serviced with drinks. Dinner finally arrives and it was delicious- zero complaints from anyone about food. Check comes and so does the pen and paper. There are about 20 of us and a mile long bill that has to get passed around the table. Once we finally get done writing everything out, we hand the paper to the server and he proceeds to take 20 mins at the POS. My husband goes to grab a manager to let him know what's going on and see if they can help the guy and right when the manager walks over so does the server so we think he's finally done and the manager walks away... but pyske! The server was actually just coming over to ask a question about the bill. He does this twice more! Overall the entire check debacle took at least 45 minutes of our evening. This isn't Red Robin, it's a nice restaurant and the server received auto-gratuity for our large party. The entire experience should have been far different. While the food was good, Vegas is brimming with great places to eat that have service to match. Last note- the manager that my husband spoke to never came back to check on us. He walked by and saw that we were STILL sitting there 10-15 mins after he stopped by the first time and he never intervened to see what was going on or to see if we were okay. In fact, it actually felt like he was avoiding us. Super disappointed in this experience that was supposed to be a great time celebrating our friend's 30th birthday.",

That was awesome.  Service was overall decent. The bread basket was awesome. I'm not a huge fan of pastries usually but I finished all the bread in the basket. It was that good.  Creamy polenta with truffled mushrooms - This was amazing! We ordered 1 portion to share and they preemptively split the order for us. Cool.  Truffled burrata with roasted tomatoes and salsa verde sauce - This was their daily special and it was super delicious. This is a must order!   Foie gras and duck ravioli - This was way too rich. We ate a couple of mouthful and had to get it to go :(  Uni pasta - Again, way too rich. We had a split order and couldnt even finish half the portion! :(   I'm not sure why but both the pasta entrees were just too rich for us and that totally killed the experience :( I wish the waiter warned us more in advance :(",

Currently my status is a LV resident, hence I'm a 'follower' now:)   The interior is nice, but it has a spectacular view of those fountains nearby;) Please don't eat all the delicious bread, make sure you have room for some of the classic dishes here.  As you enter into Scarpetta there is a lovely lounge area, which will not disappoint if you failed in making a reservation.  Desserts, of course all are exceptional!

I was really looking forward to trying this place especially since there is one in Los Angeles. My husband talked about their black ink uni pasta non-stop weeks before we actually get here and they decided to alter the menu ... bad idea. Instead we ordered the new version \"black calamarata\" which hardly has uni flavor. The entire dish is a hot mess... I couldn't finish it. The yellowtail crudo had a lot of crunch which was an odd texture. Fish was very fresh. The octopus was meh. The burrata salad was great.. I actually enjoyed it. They give you great fresh bread choices and spreads which I loved. Dessert was tasty but nothing special. The cucumber cocktail I had was very refreshing but when I ordered a second the bartender butchered it. My husbands Jameson Ginger was bad second time too. New bartender.. it happens. They fixed it but for the price tag on the meal in the end I think there are many other places I would recommend first.",

The table shared a variety of desserts which were all excellent.",

We started with scallops and were delicious ! Cooked perfectly ! And then as an entree I got the short rib ravioli which is now my all time favorite dish ever. I can't go back to just ravioli anymore bc of this. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and he loved it! Then to top it all off we shared the tiramisu and that too was very delicious! Idk how to describe our meal it was just VERY DELICIOUS AND FLAVORFUL !We will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised to dine at strip Italian restaurant that serves some REALLY GOOD Italian food. Even better when you get to see bellagio fountains as you devour awesome food. We were started off with their signature bread basket with an assortment of 4 types of bread. The focaccia and ciabatta were my fav and my husband loved the broccoli mozzarella bread. Served with butter, olive oil and eggplant tapenade.  They don't have a kids menu but have 2 pastas on the menu spaghetti in red sauce and another pasta in white sauce that kids can enjoy. Priced around $27-$30 pretty pricy for kids and portions are enough for a 9 year old. We ordered filet of beef which was by far one the best in town. My husband had the black cod which was delish and I had the raviolini served with Parmesan broth and truffle ricotta, so AWESOME and perfect temperature. Never had anything quite like this! So yummy!!  It was a busy Sunday night and I only saw 2 servers and a lady who took care of water and dishes, stefania who was so sweet,  and a bread server.  They do have a sommelier on site and he is very helpful with wine selections. Wine by the bottle is pricy, mostly all over $100 and very few in the $60s range. We decided to do wine by glass and they are all priced at $15 and up. I had a glass of prosecco $16, husband started with Pinot Noir $19 and then Chianti $15.  Corkage fee is $35 as long as you don't bring a wine on their wine list. I would highly recommend bring your own bottle and pay the $35 coz their sparkling and white wine selection is pretty limited.  For dessert we ordered tiramisu  $11, which was too good! Served with dark chocolate Scarpetta cookies, so yummy. Pic attached. This is a pricy place, you are looking at $75 plus Per person but well worth the food and ambiance.",

We ordered the mushrooms and polenta for an appetizer. I could not stop eating it! Creamy polenta, completely smooth, mushrooms in a jus- I wanted to drink the sauce. Rich, thick, savory. Be sure to order that.  We both ordered the short rib agnolotti for our main dish. It does say it has horseradish it the dish but we were expecting just a hint of it. It was overwhelming. That was all you could taste. That's why the 3 star rating.  They did bring me a dessert tasting menu for my birthday that was delicious.  I would go here again, but would order a different main dish.",

My girlfriends and I really like Scarpetta and ever since we went about 5 years ago, we try to go there at least once a year. We always rave about the dishes: this is really really good Italian. The duck and foie gras ravioli is definitely one of my faves but really all dishes I have tried from their menu have always been big hits.  The view on the Bellagio is obviously amazing and the service has always been good. The servers typically have good recommendations, not only for the food but they are happy to recommend cocktails and wines.  A good tip to save on some money is to go during happy hour (they call it social hour): they serve smaller portions of their dishes at a really good price.  I think it is a bit overpriced but when in Vegas... I always go back!",

The atmosphere is cool and calm, no complaints with the service, and all in all a solid place to try at least once. However, if you are visiting from out of town and/or it's a special occasion, I feel like you could probably find a few better or more memorable options for the same price point. That being said, this is a very good restaurant located in the chic and fabulous Cosmopolitan hotel.  If you're staying at the Cosmo for a few days and are having a chill/lazy day where you just want to stay on grounds I would 100 percent recommend Scarpetta for a lovely dinner.",

Our experience here was pleasant and very memorable :)  Ambiance - dark, romantic, trendy, upscale. Great for a date or fancy dinner with friends/family   Service- excellent. Waitstaff was super attentive. I never had an empty water glass!   Food- delicious but a little on the heavy side. Definitely come hungry! We had gotten the pre fix meal with several modifications. They had also added a few complimentary items which was nice! We started off with a bread basket which came with marscapone butter and eggplant tapenade. Some of the bread rolls had ham and cheese! I had to stop myself from stuffing myself from the bread. I don't remember everything we ate but some of the highlights were: polenta... it was so creamy and smooth! I've never had polenta like that. And we had some steak which was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The lobster Pesto noodles were also delicious and came with several lobster chunks and al dente handmade (seemed like it at least?) noodles. The bone marrow pasta and duck and foie gras ravioli were so interesting and tasty. Portions were pretty big and we left sooo stuffed. I also loved the desserts- the strawberry pana cotta had an extremely dense yet smooth texture which paired well with the strawberry gelato on top. We also loved the bombolini which were basically sugar coated donut balls.   Value- we spend around $200 a person after tax and tip which was not bad considering all the food we got! It was good to try but I might get a la carte next time :p",

Tonight our server was mediocre at best. Barely checked on us at all. Never asked us if we would like anything to drink besides water. The kicker was serving half our party their desserts while the other half didn't even get to order dessert. Then, they proceeded to clear all the plates and served the other party their course afterwards.   I also found it interesting that the server only addressed the man at the table and never the woman. Too bad for him, it's the woman who paid the check tonight and decided on the tip! It's the 21st century. Our party clearly wasn't out on a romantic date where it might have been chivalrous to only address the man. I suppose misogyny is alive and well at this establishment.   Sadly, the service here used to be excellent but has clearly gone down the tubes. I wonder if Scott Conant realizes his restaurant is not keeping up the same standards as in previous years.",

For the pastas I had the black tagliolini and the duck & foie gras ravioli.  Both were excellent, although the foie ravioli was a little too rich for how much they gave you.  My friend liked the spaghetti but he did say it was a bit over sauced for his likings.  He did rave about the duck.  Overall I would come back.  The pastas all looked great and would do something similar of trying a couple of them.",

It's located inside The Cosmopolitan hotel, and it's a bit of a walk from the lobby, but it's definitely worth the walk. I had the spaghetti, which is what it's famous for and it was incredible. My friends got a mixture of Braised Short Ribs, Pesto Pasta, and Spaghetti. Everything was FANTASTIC. The service was GREAT and I would definitely go back. The only downside is that it closes early....about 11pm. It's definitely not a late night spot. You also need to make an appointment. It was definitely the best meal I had in Vegas.

Scarpetta's pasta was delicious and the gravy/sauce was good too.  I'm not into Italian fine dining too much ... im into the family style eating pounds of pasta and gravy with some huge meatballs and sausage kinda guy ... and im Filipino go figure!!! but when i do go to a fine dining establishment that Italian scarpetta is my choice.... try it you might like it!!",

    "text": "Located on the third floor on restaurant row and a hallway's distance from the newly erected Chelsea, the restaurant was elegant with a cool jazzy swagger to it. Warm Edison style lighting cascading above with a panoramic window view of the Bellagio fountains! What more could you ask for? Well, yeah great service comes with your reservation as well. Our server Titus was a pro! He was thoughtful friendly and attentive. That said, the supporting staff and sommelier were equally charming and helpful.    I decided on the New Year's Eve pre fixe, no brainer right with a bottle of bubbly to accompany the memorable experience.   Our first course was a tuna tartare prepared with pine nuts and topped with micro greens. The texture was light with a supple mouthfeel. It had a subtle nutty flavor to it tasting almost like a steak tartare, which I adore.  Two small toastettes accompanied this whimsically delicious starting dish, as well.  Second course was a roasted sea scallop topped with foie gras and served with a butternut squash raisin caper caponata. Now I've had my share of scallop dishes and for the most part I'm usually left feeling underwhelmed  but not with this dish. Foie gras and scallops are like a match made in foodie heaven. The thick and beautifully seared scallop medallion paired with rich velvety foie gras and the sweet & salty tang of the creamy butternut squash and caper caponata made each bite a flavor explosion in my mouth. Superb!  Just when I thought it couldn't get better, the following dish blew me away! A pumpkin ravioli topped with crumbled amaretto cookies. The Hand made ravioli was soft and perfectly cooked, the creamy pumpkin coupled with crunchy amaretto cookies was a play on all my senses! The sweet flavor and fragrant aroma also made this intoxicating dish not only decadent  but a satisfying flavor journey I'd gladly take again and again!   The final savory dish was a wagyu beef served atop a creamy mash with spinach. Now this dish speaks for itself. You simply can't go wrong with perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth, literally! It's a symphony of delights from start to finish. Encore!   From the amazing cuisine, exceptional service, sleek & cool environs and awesome view, I really couldn't ask for more out of a wonderfully unforgettable NYE dinner.  Bravo Scarpetta!!!",

You can order meatballs on your crack spaghetti? Hell yesss and if you think you loved the spitball than, wait till you have them with these tiny little meatballs. Now, I have a new addiction.. THE HALIBUT! WTH??? and the scallops! Talk about not eating much seafood, but Friday night I was seeing a lot of SEAFOOD and loving it! By the time I had a drink called the Smashing Blush and some other specialty drink with whiskey, yup, you heard me... WHISKEY, I guess I was blushing smashed. Overall, service and food was impeccable and the desserts, were enough for me to think about not taking the leftover few strands of spaghetti back to my hotel room. Now, THANK GOD I did, since after my Pitbull Concert and another cocktail from the show, I stumbled in my room hungry and hungover and cold spaghetti at 12:00 AM, was still delicious!",

Cocktails were extra tasty though and hence that's why 2 stars.   Our server decided to ruin it for us. Within 5 minutes, decided to tell us that \" I am going to hand over to someone Mr X, and you can tell him your price range\". What made him decide on my price range? Because I looked through wine list and found no cocktails? Or I even hate to say this but I was neither a corporate client nor a rich patron? Give me another good reason to hand me over to a lower staff? After that it was just downhill for me. Give this place a shot if you fulfill their criteria of a good ticket! We were wanting to celebrate a special occasion. Thank you for completely ruining it. I have read similar condescending behavior reviews about this place but didn't want to believe those. Not anymore.",

I had a window seat and it was just amazing to watch the water show every few minutes while overlooking the strip.  The bread was amazing! Eggplant dipping sauce yum!  The following was ordered: Mushroom Polenta - give me a pot of this I will down it in one sitting. So flavorful. Such great texture. I know what you're thinking \"why would I come here to order a mash potato dish\" don't be fooled people- it's pure heaven.  The spaghetti - by far the best spaghetti I've ever had. The tomatoes and Basel sauce was to die for. The pasta was cooked just perfectly -al dente .  It's simple but great.  Short rib agnolotti - what can I saw - sweet yet savory. Filling yet not enough to cut your appetite to see what's next.  Remember gusher the fruit snack? This is like an adult version... No joke!  Pici - pesto lobster pasta with tarragon. Warning this can be a little spicy for some people, but if you like spicy this is your dish. The amount of lobster in the dish was perfect and so fresh. The dish in general is something that is so unorthodox - like a spicy pesto? Who does that- well Scarpetta did and they did it perfectly!  We didn't have enough room for dessert but at least I got to try 3 pastas that are now on my top 10 list!  Service was five star also!!  Enjoy!",

Being staying in Cosmo gives us easy access to this place. We're glad we did pay a visit! We had an early dinner so we were able to sit without having a reservation during a holiday long weekend.   Their PRIME BEEF CARPACCIO* was mind-blowing! The best I've ever had! The beef was sliced so thin and it's so tender! It's cooked just right! When it's put together with the greens and cheese,, that's what you came to Vegas for! We really wanted to get a second order of this but we were too full after finishing all dishes!   I didn't know broccoli can taste so good until I had GNOCCHETTI SARDI.... The way they did it made it such a good combination of broccoli and pasta! Best pasta ever! Very tasty, creamy but not greasy or tasting too heavy!   Their STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE was another sweet surprise! We were a bit hesitated about getting this one as we thought it's some gelato on it. But we didn't regret after we got it! It's not too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness. The souffle is so soft and puffy. Love it! Will definitely go back again next time we in Vegas!",

The lobster pici was absolutely delicious, tasty, complex, flavorful, and very unique. For dessert we had the bomboloni with Nutella and the chocolate souffle. We also got a cute little sampler of tea cookies and biscotti for our joint birthday. Overall, would definitely come back again for the food and service.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place ... and I loved the way it looked and felt. But between the service that night and the food, I was really disappointed.  There was 9 of us and we ordered apps to share, and most of them missed the mark. We had : frito misto, octopus, short rib, polenta, and the tuna rolls. The calamari had veggies and a UFO- unidentifiable fried object - polenta posing as calamari. That wasn't cute. The octopus was great, but it was swimming in this bland broth of garbanzos and tomato. Yuk. The polenta was good, if u like cream of wheat for dinner, and the short rib app was just bad. Cold and bland and slimy.  Then came the mains -- I got the cod. Undercooked friggin cod. I can't have undercooked now. It. Was. Vile. I sent it back. There was a problem with service that night, and the octopus came after the mains, and our potato and Brussels sprouts never came. As an apology the restaurant comped my dish (and another angelotti that was doing the backstroke in oil) and sent out 6 desserts on the House.  I added a star because they made an expensive accommodation for their shortcoming tonight, and that def redeemed their service. The waiter was also very apologetic, and service is paramount to me, esp. in a high end restaurant. I loved the bread basket and the mascarpone butter...so much that it ended up being my dinner...since the food just wasn't good that night. So kudos on the service portion of the meal, but I will not return to this restaurant.",

Bread basket was so good I wanted more, it came with butter, eggplant spread and olive oil. Each of the bread was different. They put it in layers and it was warm. We ordered the yellow tail, short rib agnolotti and fennel black cod. We were able to sit near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We ordered cocktails as well. I got the berry smash it was fruity but not too sweet just the right bite of alcohol. My sis got the scarpetta  Cosmo it was equally delightful. There was no room for dessert we were both full. I like also how they split our dishes because we were sharing. I want to go back for more and try other pastas as well.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to come here for our last night in Vegas. We were very excited to try the man who is very particular about his Italian food and couldn't believe how delicious it was.  We started off with cocktails, which is a MUST. I had the IL Dolce Limone and my husband had the Moscow Mule. Outstanding cocktails.  We were lucky enough to get a seat right by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. If you're looking for a relaxed dinner with a semi - formal atmosphere, this is your place. I loved the formality yet relaxed environment, and appreciated how friendly the staff was!   The short rib agnolotti is like nothing else I've tried. Light yet hearty with a bit of crunch and the portion was just right. It's one of those dishes that can get monotone after a while, but this portion is just right to where it doesn't allow that to happen.   I had the Orecchiette which was also phenomenal. The homemade sausage brought it to another level, although a bit bitter from the broccoli rabe.   We finished off with the chocolate cake and the strawberry souffle. They were both very delicious, but I don't think it was anything that blew me out of the water when it came to dessert. Definitely worth trying though! I'm just particular about my desserts.  All in all, phenomenal dinner. We will be back!",

    "text": "With so many cooking competition shows out there, I've always been curious how good some of these renowned chefs and judges really are.  Certain guys clearly have the cred to back it up, but there are others I'm not as familiar with.  Chopped's Scott Conant was one of the latter, but I can now say, without a hint of doubt, that...  SCOTT CONANT IS BAD ASS.  Although it may not have been the original Scarpetta in NY, my meal at this location was still pretty fantastic.  I'd even say they rank as one of my all around favorite restaurants, along with The Spence in Atlanta and State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.  Honestly, everything we had was terrific.  It's also easy now to see why Scott Conant is so tough on contestants who dare to cook pasta on the show - Scarpetta's ranks as the best I've had thus far!  -- BREAD BASKET...Complimentary (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#hYFt6DlCGHA332ECJChzLQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>) Not normally something I would bother mentioning because bread is bread.  That is, unless it's got salami baked into it.  Well played Scott Conant, well played.  -- ROASTED DIVER SCALLOPS with Morels, Sugar Snap, Watermelon Radish and Pea Froth...$23 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#V_vEStj9d5Uur3sAloUvZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>) My friend and I split an order and our server was kind enough to have it plated separately for us.  The scallop had a near perfect sear (could have been harder) and the center couldn't have been cooked any better - soft and tender.  The pea froth complemented the scallop's sweetness quite well.  -- DUCK FOIE GRAS RAVIOLI with a Marsala Reduction...$27 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#rJ2lg-UKLTLOss3CPgcrYQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>) Simply fantastic.  I was already dead set on ordering this, but it was nice to find out it was one of their signature dishes.  The ravioli was amazing - silky and tender with just the right bite.  Although the foie gras filling was awesome on its own, the marsala reduction made it that much better!  -- SHORT RIB AGNOLOTTI with Brown Butter, Horseradish, and Toasted Breadcrumbs...$26 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#x9WaFDf-qarVghjn7g-iYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>) My friend ordered this one and it gave the ravioli a serious run for its money.  The pasta was just as good in this dish and the short rib added a nice bit of savoriness.  The breadcrumbs didn't do a ton for me, but it still tasted great.  -- STRAWBERRY SOUFFLE with a Rhubarb Compote and Vanilla Gelato...$11 (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#UUgJpj3_-6a9_rBmpTbrSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>) Not to gush like a little girl, but damn this was good!  I thought the compote and gelato would be too much sweetness, but the dish had just the right amount of sweetness and the souffle had a perfect consistency.  I honestly don't know what else to say other than that YOU MUST GET THIS.  While the meal itself was amazing, I thought some of the hostesses could really use an attitude check.  For some reason, they seem to think they're better than everyone else and do very little to hide it.  It seems other Yelpers have left with the same impression, but at least our waiter Christian and the rest of the wait staff more than made up for it.  Beyond the food and service though, Scarpetta might be worth a trip just to take in the view!  The dining room area (not the bar section) has giant bay windows that face the Bellagio fountains and the strip (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scarpetta-las-vegas?select=dPyovDlWT4wM9GCaxo59yw#3OL0vvlkTy4YgBuGuBi7cw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/scar...</a>).  Unfortunate I was only there with a friend instead of a girlfriend though (sorry bud).  Scarpetta, I'll definitely be seeing you again during my next trip to Vegas.  And considering how often I seem to be there, it'll probably be a lot sooner than later!",

    "text": "Being from Nyc I've been wanting to go and try Scarpetta after hearing many great reviews about it. I was heading to Vegas in a few days and realized that Scarpetta was also in the Cosmopolitan, so I decided to make reservations for the group of 8 that I was with. (Walking through the Cosmo later that day I noticed Chef Scott Conant who is the owner walking into the restaurant which is nice to see the care for his restaurant)  So after arriving a few minutes earlier than the rest of my party, I decided to check in with the host. After talking for a minute he mentioned to me that they had the Chef's table available if interested, to which I responded YES! As we walked through the dining room passing many full table we entered a private room with floor to ceiling glass with a few of the kitchen and the other wall was the same but with a few of the Bellagio fountains which was beautiful.  Soon after the waiter and sommelier (Noel) entered to find out which wine that we would like for the evening. I didn't deal the \"wine man\" but did enjoy a nice Cabernet with my dinner. Good choice sir. Waiter placed some delicious bread (even from being from NY) along with a mascarpone butter, citrus infused olive oil, and eggplant caponata. All were excellent. On to the primi piatti, we ordered a few for the table including the tuna susci, Mediterranean octopus, braised short ribs, and polenta. All were fixed to perfection, the octopus stood out to me because it's a very delicate item and easily under or over cooked. The short ribs had a hard time staying on the bone. Tuna was cubed and paired with avocado, close to a perfect bite. I will only speak for myself when it comes to my entree which was the famous Spaghetti with tomato and basil (unfair to call it a sauce when it's so much better than just a sauce.) Living in nyc all my life where pasta is \"supposed\" to be the best I'm very picky because most Italian restaurants don't put any care into the dish. QUITE the OPPOSITE, on the record going to say probably best pasta dish I've ever had. Seasoned fantastically, silky/savoy tomato/basil, pasta was cooked perfectly. $24 dollars seems like a lot but if you taste how good it is...you'll probably think it's one of the best deals in Vegas next to the $9.99 lobsters. Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their various pasta dishes( orecchiette, tagliatelle, pici). Only 2 problems. ONE the waiter was hard to get a hold off and didn't stop in frequently enough, probably due to being secluded in the chef's table room. TWO my girlfriend order a souffle for dessert and it was slightly raw, which was taken back. Besides those slight setbacks I've really it was an excellent experience. Definitely would go back especially after missing out on the foie grad ravioli. Soils 4 stars!!! Good job Mr.Conant!",

Mike our server is amazing and very attentive. For starters we the divers scallops and the creamy polenta so perfectly seasoned and cooked, melts in your mouth. The duck foie gras ravioli is to die for! All the entrees from the Branzino, Filet mignon are so flavorful. Everything is made with shear perfection. The Souffles are out of this world and worth the wait! 5 stars this restaurant should be rated!",

    "text": "There is a Scarpetta in NYC but as of last week I have only been to the Las Vegas location. Marc Maron interviewed Scott Conent (who I have seen on TV a number of times) and talked about the spaghetti dish and how he could not believe how good it was. Well it is VERY good. My mom hadn't been feeling great prior to our trip so I think  she didn't really absorb how good the meal was. I had a special appetizer that had Octopus and lentils which was really good. We had a table near the window and were able to see the Bellagio Fountains. Mom had scallops-she said they were good. The spaghetti was really out of this world. Every time one has fresh pasta I think you are reminded that no matter how skilled a cook someone is if it is dry in a box-it is dry in a box. This clearly had been made day of and the tomato sauce, was flavorful and the pasta wasn't drowning in it.  We had the ricotta cheesecake which was a small round serving (different than other places) with some fruit sauce.",

The best part was the gluten-free menu; that is always easier than \"I don't know, let me check with the kitchen.\".   We were seated next to the bus station in spite of having a reservation, and there was a table by the window open the entire time we were there.   The service was excellent, attentive, not obtrusive.  Wines by the glass were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, overpriced.  The food was very good. I had the spaghetti with tomatoes and basil, which many reviews mentioned as \"amazing\". I have a very similar recipe at home that I enjoy equally. The creamy polenta with mushrooms was a great starter. Everyone else enjoyed their meals.  My husband ordered a flourless chocolate cake, which he practically inhaled. There were closed eyes and moans of pleasure with each bite.",

Sicilian-spiced duck breast with preserved orange, root vegetables and caramelized endive. I was pleasantly surprised.   Duck & Foie gras ravioli- RICH RICH RICH and flavorful.   Mediterranean Orata- Very light and flavorful. The fish skin was crispy and the meat was moist.  The dinner was good but it was the desserts that made it great!

We are big fans of the spaghetti in Miami and wanted to see if it would be the same.  Who would have thought that an unassuming spaghetti dish would be so amazing?  It doesn't even have any meat in it and it is so good!  I get my own because I don't like to share it.  If you want to try other things, it's great to split because it is very rich....cheese and cream, and butter...oh my!   The bread is delish, especially the stromboli, love the accoutrements, olive oil, mascarpone butter, eggplant spread. The heirloom tomato salad is always a good stand by as well.  We had the scallop appetizer this time, and it was very good.  We never really have room for dessert, and had to catch a show, so we passed. Maybe next time we will try the panna cotta.  All in all, I still love the Miami location better. The service is pretty consistent with both locations, just a different slightly more relaxed vibe in Miami.  Besides, who can beat a view of the ocean and the sleek, modern, nautical decor of Scarpetta Miami.",

Server, some jackass who really could care less about being professional and more concerned about the table of 3 girls a few table away giving them free food all night. He finally arrived at our table about 5 minutes after being seated, took our cocktail orders and then....disappeared. He came back with our drinks 15 minutes later and blamed the \"bartenders were backup up\". Really? Because our martinis were warm when you served us which were very ordinary and especially at $15 per.  Busboy brought us bread which only one type was decent so we just asked for that only instead. Waiter \"I will make sure to get that out to you immediately\" That never happened.  Food:  Heirloom tomato with Burrata- meh! I know its very simple and the wife wanted it but was as if Olive Garden made it. Really nothing special and was not seasoned properly.  Polenta with morels- again meh! Average at best.  Spaghetti what he is known for- very good not great. Would I order that again, no.  Halibut- dry!   This place is a joke and we got duped!   Pedestrian Food, Awful Service, High Prices = Avoid!",

    "text": "I had HIGH expectations coming to this place. EXTREMELY high expectations. For all the attention to detail and harsh criticisms that Scott has on Chopped, I anticipated a True culinary masterpiece.   My girlfriend and I weren't that hungry, because we had already had an early dinner, but decided to give this place a shot because it was the only day that would have worked with our trip to Las Vegas. We thought the best thing to do would be to just order an appetizer and only one course each, as opposed to the traditional multiple courses with a True Italian meal. We ordered the short ribs as an appetizer, I ordered the spaghetti and my girlfriend ordered the roasted chicken.  The best part of the meal was the bread. You heard me. The BEST part of the meal was the bread. I must say, I had high hopes going in, higher hopes after the bread, because that was good bread. The focaccia was tasty, with the right amount of rosemary and well developed. It tasted fresh and airy. The other breads were also very good.   We got our appetizer, and it was very small - which is usual for a good Italian place, since it's expected that you order multiple courses. This wasn't an appetizer though, it was basically an amuse-bouche. The ribs had good flavor, and the risotto was good as well, it good texture, but I would have liked it to be cooked a little longer - it wasn't crunchy, but it was still slightly underdone.   Out come our main courses.   My pasta is placed on the table, and the server removes the cloche. My first impression? \"This is a main course?\" I counted how many bites it took me to finish that pasta, and it was nine. Literally nine. It was such a small meal that I was still slightly hungry afterwards - even though I wasn't all that hungry coming in. And as for the flavor? I think Barilla pasta and Prego sauce tastes about the same, as long as you add some fresh basil, which was the only saving grace. But for $24, this was ludicrous. The pasta was just about al dente as well, so there was good texture. And as for the chicken? Horrible. Absolutely horrible. And small. I asked the server about the preparation, and he noted that it is brined with anise and some other flavors, which were conspicuously missing from the flavor of the dish. I ended up spending around $80 on just these three items, and definitely was left wondering why. Scarpetta gets the award for most over-promised, under-delivered food experience I've had so far. It was so bad that any time I see Scott on Chopped or any other show, I feel like he has no idea what he is talking about. Avoid this place, and go to Secret Pizza just down the hall instead - you'll save money, eat tastier food, and leave with a better experience.",

    "text": "The hallmarks of an elite Las Vegas restaurant are outstanding food, personable service, and a great atmosphere. If a restaurant can hit on all three of these, and do so at a reasonable price, they deserve a fifth star. Scarpetta doesn't even belong in the same sentence as some of the amazing Vegas hotspots. Lets start with the good- Scarpetta has a nice location with a good view of the strip and prides itself on a swanky and sleek atmosphere. Its dark, the jazzy music is loud, and the table settings a slick. The other \"views\" are good too- as the younger crowd will probably afford you a few peaks at some <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmatch.com&s=5a7ad17eb3943c81dac85ae79b9c0c050694769f0de09ef7d94e7ed56fd99c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">match.com</a> dates happening around you. Your jaw will even drop as soon as you see the cans on the hostess, but its all downhill after that at Scarpetta.  To start, the restaurant was a hot box, so bring a wet towel to cool off. The service was atrociously impersonal and inattentive. Great restaurants have teams of servers constantly working your table, making suggestions, and guiding you through the experience. We had no sommelier to talk about wines with. Our waiter was a smug and unsmiling grump who detracted even more from the average food. The pasta dishes we ordered were step above Barilla pasta with some canned Ragu sauce. The beef tar tar was tasteless. How could some many be so wrong about this place? OVER-RATED! Clap, clap. Clap, Clap, Clap. If you want overpriced, average food with a forgettable personal touch slathered all over your plate- hit Scarpetta. If you want to enjoy a meal- look elsewhere.",

    "text": "I have to say I indulged in almost every meal in my 4 day stay in Vegas, but this was by far the best. The most decadent, delicious, and just memorable.   At the tables in Cosmo friday afternoon we were pondering where to have a late dinner before hitting the clubs. The player to my left said Scarpetta had an amazing, but simple spaghetti dish that was to die for. Keeping our fingers crossed, we wandered upstairs around 6:30 and were able to secure a 9:30 reservation and requested a tiny 2 person table in the corner with a great window view. Even though we were running about 15 minutes late, they were gracious enough to hold the table for us.   Upon arrival, we didn't even have to give our name and check in, the host immediately remembered us from 3 hours earlier and sat us promptly at the requested table. The view of the Bellagio and the water show was fantastic! The only issue I had was that we were not given a menu or even a wine list for at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Normally this wouldn't be a problem I presume, but it was 9:30 and we were pretty much starving at this point.   After we were presented with menus though, the bread basket pretty much had our full attention for a good while. The selection of bread and spreads was DELICIOUS. We literally ate almost all of it...the focaccia was incredible. I ordered a gin and tonic, and my friend a glass of moscato. They were both delicious with our meals.   We shared the beef carpaccio appetizer, and it was absolutely delicious--just the perfect amount for 2 people to share since we weren't looking to eat a heavy meal, but wanted to try a starter. We shared 2 pasta dishes--the spaghetti everyone raves about and the duck and foie gras ravioli. Personally I absolutely savored the ravioli--i love foie gras and duck, so it was perfect. The Spaghetti my friend liked more--it was simple, but good.   Definitely coming back here on my next trip to Vegas in May!",

The portions looked small but it does fill you up.  The beef tartare was also pretty amazing!  Great cozy ambiance in the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.  I would definitely come back.....after my wedding of course.",

    "text": "last stop on the \"cosmo food crawl \"   Starting to feel the effects of the crawl but we gotta make a final stop for the restaurant that allegedly makes some of the best pasta in the U.S.   Again, sat in the lounge area of the restaurant. While waiting for the table, i tried a few of the chips that are complementary at the bar - very good ! had fried basil blended in with some bite to them - not sure if it was red pepper or not.   While we were virtually ignored at Comme Ca, Scarpetta was the other end of the spectrum ( an not in a good way ) - our server was nice but man, way to pushy on trying to up sell, especially the drinks.   Went with lighter wine this time - name escapes me but it was a $10 glass - nice. We also opted for some sparkling water - $9.   Ordered the spaghetti ( $24 ) , the creamy polenta with fricasse mushrooms ( $16 ) and the branzino ( sis wanted the cod but the server almost insisted that the branzino was the way to go - she relented - $26 )   The spaghetti was a joy - might be tad bit too strong in basil , but it worked for me. What surprised us was a little heat to the sauce - the server was also a little surprised to hear this ... to the point i don't think she believed us.   The polenta was extremely rich but dang good. the fricasse was better here than the mushrooms we had at comme ca and helped cut through some of the richness of the polenta.   The branzino was perfectly cooked, simple seasoning but great taste. nice.   We went with the amedei Chocolate cake ( basically a molton lava cake $11) with a toasted almond gelato and a salted caramel sauce ( the reason why we got it - $3) and then a separate scoop of tangerine sorbet.   I tell ya, that tangerine was a heck of finish to our food fest - so frickin refreshing - I will go back for that every time i'm in the building !!",

    "text": "Good food at high prices.  That's ok by me.  Have to give a big thumbs up to our server.  Not enough of a thumbs up to remember his name, unfortunately.  Looks like the Asian guy in the last Rambo movie.  Think he's on The Mentalist or one of those types of shows.  He gave it to his straight ie. this dish is no good and try this.  Always appreciated as long as you know what you're talking about.  Duck and foie gras ravioli - Despite being a foodie I am not big on the foie.  But this was a nice, rich, delicate dish.  A bit overpowering on the foie if you ask me but maybe I'm sensitive to that flavor. Scallops - friends thought it was great.  I don't like scallops. Steak tartare - pretty darn good.  Believe it was a Kobe beef tartare.  Nice beefy flavor (durrrr) though the accompaniments could have been better.  No toast points, no creamy sauce, no capers, eggs, etc.  Seemed a tad plain. Spiced duck breast - waiter warned me against this as he thought it has too much cumin.  The cumin smell was indeed higher than even Master Yoda's midiclorian count but it's fate was not clouded by cumin taste.  The taste was strong with this one and more powerful than the waiter could ever imagine.  If anything, the cumin scent gave the dish focus, made it stronger.  (yes I like Star Wars)  Big thumbs up to the bread basket.  There was one with salami or some sort of cured meat with it.  Yummy.  Not sure the marscapone butter was any better than normal butter but it was goody goody.",

They were having some computer problems.  It would have been great if the server came and explained that to us, instead he just disappeared and I guess was trying to fix it.  I am not a needy diner by any means, however, our wine glasses were empty for a while (which we spent $70 per glass for), we would have ordered dessert but it just took too long.  It was almost like we were forgotten.  Spending almost $300 for 2 people should get you AMAZING service.",

    "text": "So, I was in Vegas for a fab Race/Scavenger Hunt event, and met up with friends the night before the event at Scarpetta for what I hoped would be an excellent meal.  It did not disappoint.  There were some nice-sounding appetizers on the menu, but we bypassed those in favor of ordering the day's pasta special as our starter.  it was linguini with truffle, and it was perfect.  Possibly the best pasta I've ever eaten.  Seriously, I wish I'd ordered that again as my meal.  And then maybe again as dessert.  Table faves included the aged sirloin, the orata rossa, the scallops and the sunchokes.  The roasted baby carrots were also pretty great.  The spaghetti was fine, but, honestly, after that starter, it just couldn't compete.  The gingerbread-pear crisp was the fave dessert, though all were good.  The fave wine of the night was the super tuscan, though it was crazy with sediment (something I'm surprised they didn't notice before serving it).",

    "text": "I must admit, my expectations were somewhat low for Scarpetta, as I usually find the Las Vegas outposts of famous restaurants to be more about decor and overpriced menus, and less about food.  I was glad to be proven wrong.  Although Scarpetta definitely delivers in the \"Las Vegas Hip\" decor, with a gorgeous dining room that has a glass-enclosed wine cellar on one wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains on the other, it also delivers on the food front.  At the waiters recommendation, my group of three decided to share a Primi (app) and Pasta, and order our own entrees.  Before our first course came out, we were brought fresh bread basket which I can honestly say was the BEST bread I've ever had.  A mix of rosemary ciabatta, focaccia, and this to-die-for bread that had salami and mozzarella in it.  The accompaniments of Olive Oil, Eggplant spread, and Mascarpone Butter were equally satisfying.  Here is a by-dish review:  Heirloom tomato salad w/ stracciatella, salsa verde & marinated eggplant:  This dish was good, if not a bit common.  It seems so many restaurants have an heirloom tomtato & burrata dish, that if you've had one, you've had them all - although I was happy to learn that stracciatella is an equally awesome burrata-style cheese.  Creamy polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms: Hands down the best polenta anyone at our table had ever had.  It was so creamy and rich, and went great with the mushrooms which were served from a separate pot.  Duck & Foie Gras ravioli w/ marsala reduction:  This dish was very well received by the two people in my party who'd never had foie gras.  I am a huge fan of foie, and found the dish to be lacking the richness that usually comes when it's served on it's own - but overall a great dish.  Pancetta-wrapped Veal Loin w/ sweetbreads, peas & carrots: The veal loin was my favorite dish of the night.  I am used to having sweetbreads battered and fried, so it was interesting to have them in a more natural state - small chunks cooked and mixed in with the vegetables.  Zeppole w/ nutella center, vanilla sauce & candied hazelnuts: WOW - we were blown away by how good this dessert was.  Little chocolate donut holes filled with nutella - YUM.  I will say that their wine list leans towards the expensive side, with only a few bottles in the $60 - $70 range.  We ordered the Castello di Bossi Chianti Classcio Riserva Berardo, which was $105 (retails for $30) - a good wine, but a bit pricey.",

Despite the reservations we were not seated as promptly as I would like, but the wait was not too long. We did request to be seated where we could see the fountains, a wish that went unfulfilled.I understand Vegas was at its capacity that weekend so I suppose it is forgivable though disappointing. We had the braised short ribs, spaghetti, and the duck & foie gras ravioli. We ended the meal with an unmemorable custard.   Our waiter was excruciatingly nice, checking up on us every few minutes, never daring to let the water drain completely from our cups. He even remembered my boyfriend from his last business trip there.  The eggplant spread, short ribs, the spaghetti were nothing short of magnificent especially the spaghetti which lived up to all of its hype. I could eat an entire barrel of that spaghetti in all its simplistic perfection. My only issue was that my ravioli was so salty I could barely eat it. It won't deter me from coming back again though.",

My dining experiences have ranged from a two-seated table with the view of the Bellagio fountains to the private chef's table with the view of the kitchen.  I've had the typical a la carte menu to the seven-course tasting menu.  If I had to choose my favorite experience between them all, my personal preference is the two-seated table with the a la carte menu.  The service here is very prompt and attentive.  From the Managers to the wait staff, service is priority here.  Shout out to Kelly, the General Manager, as she personally knows how to take care of her customers.  To start off the meal, you are presented with a one of my most favorite bread baskets ever.  The three accompanying spreads are vey unique and delicious. Their stromboli bread is sinfully good.  My personal favorite dishes: -  Roasted Sea Scallops:  Simple and well executed.  My only complaint is the size of the portion. -  Spaghetti:  Simple, clean, and classic.  FYI, the pasta is al dente. -  Risotto:  Slightly al dente, yet creamy at the same time. -  Tagliatelle:  Comforting dish that is full of flavor.  My personal favorite. -  Fennel Spiced Black Cod:  Flaky yet bold in taste.  If you are looking for a restaurant with a sexy ambiance, delicious food, and excellent service, come to Scarpetta.  It's my personal \"go to\" spot for dinner dates.",

I got the branzino and it was very good. My husband got the waygu cap steak that was on special and loved it! Still talking about it.  I think it was about $65, it filled him up. We did not get salad (extra, not inculded). My friend got a caesar and it was beautiful! Loved the presentation.  They both get the filet and they said it was perfect.  Tip, 2 entrees and I think 2 drinks was $156. Not the most we have spent on a meal.  FYI for weddings, they charge between $6- $13 per person to bring in your own cake.",

The place was about 50% full. The service at the start was incredible but tapered off towards the end of the evening when they swapped out waiters on us. Wait staff however all very knowledgeable about the wine and the food. I started with Octopus which was delicious followed by the lobster pici. The pici was very nice indeed, tasty and pretty rich. The pasta itself was very dense and cooked al dente which took a little more effort to eat than perhaps it should have. It was a good size portion. I had a cheesecake for desert but at that point was too full to really appreciate it's intricate flavors. My wife started with the lobster salad which was also excellent followed by the Branzino, again delicious. Modern decor with a chilled yet sophisticated ambience. I wore a jacket but pretty sure you could dine here in a t-shirt if you wanted to. We dropped just over $300 for the evening including a modestly priced bottle of white wine. If this wasn't Vegas I would say it was not worth that kind of outlay. Seemed a little overpriced. But who knows.",

On the show he comes off as a cocky chef who is cocky because he can cook damn well.  Well, all the dishes I sampled were incredibly disappointing. The bread basket was stale. The garden salad that I ordered was soooo overdressed that it was unpalatable. I couldn't taste the sliced beets or even the spicy arugula. It was too vinegary. Maybe a better ratio of oil to vinegar would have improved the flavor. Or no dressing .. .the Caesar salad was similarly overdressed.   For entrees, my Sig other ordered the marinara pasta with broccoli rabe, I ordered the mezzaluna with basil and ricotta salata. My sig's pasta was a bit too al dente, but it was tasty but not special. The broccoli rabe was absolutely disgusting: it was so over salted that we sent it back. We got another order which was only slightly improved. It also had an aggressive char flavor that was not pleasant. My ravioli was nothing to write home about. It tasted no better than what you could buy at trader Joe's.   I usually love ordering dessert, but I didn't bother with this restaurant. Scott Conant needs a reality check--ironic that he harshly critiques the dishes of others while his need some serious work.  BTW, the restaurant was way too dark. I love mood lighting but this was ridiculous. Don't waste your money here. Go to beauty and Essex for the soup dumplings or Holsteins, if you are staying at the cosmopolitan.",

Sitting next to the windows give you an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains.   We started out with the steak tartar which was served with some parmesean chips. Delicious app that i woukd order again. Also tried that short rib on top of risotto. Really enjoyed this as well, but 180 degrees on flavor profile from tartar. So it depends what you want you want!   The duck foie gras raviloi was 100% what you would expect. Delicate ravioli, generous filling, and a whole plate. I would eat this over and over. Also ordered the Uni pasta. This was such an interesting meal. If you enjoy seafood like i do, this will leave you wanting more. Essentially tasted like ocean. And i loved it.   Coconut soufle was amazing. Pour over sauce and side of toasted coconut.   I suppose my only real complaint was the wine. Typical vegas fashion the wine list was okay. And i found some bottles to be so over priced. $42 for a pour of 85' dows... Thats silly.  $98 dollars for a 15-25 bottle of poggio tesoro. I am a firm believer of bringing your own wine and just paying corkage in Vegas. Wine lists in vegas casinos are so awful nowadays.   Id eat here again and just always bring my own wine. 2 bottle max, $35 corkage. Bubbles, extra bottle and youre set.",

Solid 4 stars, would of been 5 but service was poor and I felt we were treated differently because we are young couples and not old rich people.  3 couples, sat right away in a large circular booth that only fit 5. One member of our party had to sit in a chair. He missed the fountain show and blocked others. I guess the can't accommodate a party of 6. Service was poor, had to ask for water, ask about specials, had to ask about the menu and it just felt like we weren't good enough for the wait staff? Anyway, if someone from the restaurant ever reads this you should put more effort into training your staff to treat everyone the same and work on service recovery!   Okay food: it was amazing! I tried all 6 meals and both apps. Everything was amazing! To bad the staff wasn't amazing.",

Not only is this restaurant located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel and from the restaurant you can see the water show at the Bellagio, but the staff are really friendly and the food is the best I have ever had in my entire life!  We tried a variety of dishes and even after I was full, I kept eating because the food was so good.  I'm still thinking about how delicious the food was and want to go back so I can eat here again!",

Just because your clients are young does not mean you pay them any less attention (we are 23 each) because you think we are going to tip you less possibly? Also one our friends had gotten pick pocketed the night before. She had asked the waiter respectfully about alternative forms of ID that were understandably declined by the manager who then went on claiming how strict they were about IDing individuals.....but then did not even ID him when it came time for our one male friend (we were both females) to order a drink. Not sure if he meant to come off as sexist but I can promise you that it did - and quite rude in his mannerisms. However we took the high road and didn't pull the manager aside to complain about his waiting staff and instead gave our waiter a 40% tip. Promise you I won't be back until I've aged at least 10+ years because they simply don't enjoy young individuals.",

We enjoyed our meal here very much (and it's not a bad value for the strip) but the bread basket was definitely less amazing than I remembered.  They still have the meat stromboli, as well as some very good sourdough and the rosemary focaccia, which used to be my favorite but now seems to be made with whole wheat dough and is no longer quite as good.    We shared two pasta dishes, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the (beef) short rib agnolotti ($26).  The short rib agnolotti was absolutely fantastic.  The duck and foie gras ravioli (which is what I had before) was ok, but there's not much foie flavor and this time the sauce had a spicy kick to it that I did not care for.  Though the waiter warned us that the pasta portions were light (in between appetizer and entree size, he said), I actually found them quite filling. I think we got about 12 raviolis, which is a very decent portion.  The restaurant has a lovely view of the strip + Bellagio fountains.  Try to get a table near the window.",

    "text": "You know those few precious moments when you're absolutely falling in love with a dish? Like your eyes roll back and you carefully savor each bite, wishing the experience will never end? It's an ecstasy that only a few restaurants can deliver. This describes my dinner experience at Scarpetta, when I delicately pulled apart my fennel dusted spiced black cod. A bed of tomatoes and roasted fennel added a tangy zest to the fish. My lawd. This must be a dream. It's too good to be True!  BAM! Snap back to reality. As I used my fork and knife to draw another piece of that tender cod to my mouth, I spotted a thin black line. Hmm, that's an interesting lookin' spice. Let me tug at it some more. Lo and behold, it was a piece of hair, and it was definitely not mine. The hair was embedded in the cod's skin! I politely informed my waiter of the situation and he apologized, then asked if I would like to replace the cod with a different dish. I just wanted another cod. I wanted to return to that euphoria I was experiencing before my foodie world came crashing down on me when I discovered that unfortunate piece of keratin.   Like Forrest Gump says, sh** happens. I understand that, but I'm at Scarpetta. This is a high-caliber restaurant, one of the best in Las Vegas, owned by the famous Chef Scott Conant. It's not something I would expect to happen here. My waiter was professional though, he quickly brought out another cod (since my partner was already done with his dish) and our dessert was on the house. I totally appreciate these gestures. Yet, when my second cod arrived, it did not taste as heavenly as the initial one. I noticed that my second dish came out a lot faster than my first, which meant it was cooked in a shorter amount of time. The meat of my second cod looked a tad raw and it was almost rubbery in texture, not as moist and soft as my first one. There goes my foodie high. Womp womp.  The kitchen staff probably invested less time and attention on my replacement dish. I know there was a slight rush to bring out my cod ASAP since my boyfriend already finished his entree. However, I was still paying for this dish and it was executed poorly compared to the first one.   This could have easily been a four or five star review. We asked for a table next to the window and the views of The Strip and the Bellagio Fountains were stunning. So romantic and beautiful. My boyfriend and I started our dinner with the Tuna \"Susci\" with marinated vegetables and preserved truffles. This is essentially tuna wrapped around vegetables. It was almost like a sushi roll, but there was too much going on. We couldn't really tease out the tuna flavor.    My boyfriend ordered the short rib & bone marrow agnolotti. It's cooked in brown butter, horseradish, and toasted breadcrumbs. He said it was good but not amazingly tasty. He was still quite hungry after finishing his pasta.   The complimentary Amedei Chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was decadent. The chocolate was not overly sweet and the almond gelato was creamy.  It wasn't purely the hair, but the fact that my second cod was unrecognizable compared to my first one. The rest of the items are pretty solid. The view is the best thing Scarpetta has to offer. And maybe that black cod...when it is cooked properly.",

Went here for our anniversary, we had their spaghetti (perfectly al dente!), some other pasta dish (beef ravioli), tuna & avocado (best appetizer), their Berry Blast drink, and their lava cake with ice cream a la mode.   Definitely an upscale restaurant so don't be surprised if the bill goes well over $100 between 2 but like any place, definitely an experience to just try at least once.  Atmosphere is dim and fairly quiet with good background music, so it's very relaxing and calming while you enjoy your food and company. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "What is with me and over-hyped restaurants for the end of 2012?  Scarpetta definitely belongs in this category based on the taste vs price category.  I mean, the restaurant looked nice, and the service was decent (if not spotty)...but the food just didn't do it.  Here's what I got to try: Bread:  Bread was good, but not amazing like how some reviewers portrayed it.  I will give points to them having stromboli  =)  .  Fritto Misto : Nice portion size but $17 for fried seaweed (super oily) with little bits of shrimp?  Scallops: Smelled great and was very tasty.   $17 for two scallops.  Raw Yellowtail: $16 for 4 REALLY thin slices of yellowtail.  Jaws not happy.  #AVOID  Spaghetti:  At $24, I expected my mind to be blown into spaghetti heaven, maybe even meeting the dogs from Lady and the tramp.  However, I was really underwhelmed by the sauce.  There was little to no seasoning so basically all I was tasting was a bit of crushed tomatoes, cheese, with bits of basil.  Simplicity does not mean bland.  The noodles were cooked al dente and had a nice texture, so that is the lone bright spot. Ugh....BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: $26.  Foie Gras in a ravioli? Must be amazing right?  Instead it was so dry that I felt like I was eating melted sand paper.  I thought duck meat was supposed to be tender and juicy?  I guess mixing duck meat and foie gras was a bad move.  The marsala reduction was delightful as I wish there was more of it to compensate for the dryness of the filling.  Roasted Chicken : Finally, a delicious dish.  It was cooked perfectly and finally seasoned correctly.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for food...as long as its delicious!  But do keep in mind that this was still $29.    Chocolate cake: Standard.  Doughnuts with filling:  It is what it is.  Doughnuts tossed in sugar with chocolate/vanilla filling.  I couldn't overlook that this dish was COLD when we ate it.  I understand that the filling could have caused that...but still... doughnuts should at least be warm!  Bottom line: Good environment, spotty service, and overhyped and expensive food give this place 2 stars.",

    "text": "I'm not a big fan of pasta because I usually try to avoid carbs. I see it as a waste of valuable tummy space that I should reserve for other food. BUT I have to give it to Scarpetta for changing my mind.  We came here in a group of six on a Sunday night. We made reservations like two hours prior, but we showed up about an hour early and were seated immediately.   Right away, we were impressed by the variety of the bread basket and the dips. I can't remember exactly but there were about six different types of bread. What really got our attention though was the eggplant dipping sauce! It was so yummy that we kept shamelessly asking for more. I think we got at least three refills of it (but hey, we had six hungry girls!).  On to the real food... My friend and I shared the Lobster Pici and the Short Rib and bone marrow agnolotti. The pici is dressed with a chili pesto sauce, and since my friend can't eat spicy foods, they split the portion for us and served it on two separate plates. I got extra chili pesto on the side in case I wanted to add more. I loved that we didn't have to try and split our dish in half ourselves. So much more convenient and I can get straight down to eating! However, it turns out that the chili pesto sauce isn't even spicy at all. If anything, it's just salty, like REALLY salty. The pieces of lobster meat still tasted good and wasn't that salty, but the pasta sat directly in the pesto and it definitely could've used less sauce/salt.  Now on to the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti... it was the last entree to come out! All the food came out already and the agnolotti was nowhere to be seen. We got sidetracked by the lobster pici and kind of forgot about our 2nd entree to share. When we realized, we asked the server where it was and if the kitchen had forgotten about it, but he assured us it will be coming out shortly. By the time it came out, everyone was done with their food. I'd say it came out 10-15 mins later than the other entrees. It wasn't so bad considering we were sharing another entree, but had we not shared, one of us would've sat there without food. Considering this is a fine dining restaurant, that is unacceptable.   But you know what, it was so delicious that I didn't care it was late. I think this has become my favorite pasta dish of all time. The flavor was very rich and smooth, with a little crunchy texture from the garlic chips. I personally liked it better than the duck and foie gras ravioli that I tried from my friend's plate. I would order this again and again. Luckily for me, there's also a Scarpetta in NY! Guess where I'll be going to dinner soon!",

We had a table for 2 with a view of the Bellagio Fountains.   Service = excellent. The waiter was amazing and started us off with a delicious glass of wine.  My friend and I told him what kind of wine we liked; a heavy red. He brought an amazing glass that was delicious. I don't recall the name, but It was a blend from Santa Barbara and exactly what we wanted.   Food = delicious. I couldn't make my mind up and asked the waiter for a suggestion between 3 pasta dishes I was considering. His suggestion was the Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti.  I've never had \"bone marrow\" anything, but I was willing to give it a try. I ate every piece and nearly licked the plate.  What I respected the most? The waiter wasn't trying to sell me on the most expensive dish. In fact, it was one of the less expensive pasta dishes to choose from!   Desert = Heavenly & Sinful. I am not a \"sweets / desert person,so I \"passed\" on ordering a desert. My friend ordered a desert that were like cream filled donuts. The waiter brought me out a tiny little spoon to \"taste\" the desert or was teasing me.  He ended up bringing me a full on desert spoon! Delicious!   Not too expensive. Great ambiance, fantastic customer service and delicious food. I will def return and suggest Scarpetta. ;-))))",

Sounds typical, and honestly not terrifically unique, but it was done well. Perfectly ripe tomatoes with the creamiest burrata. Microgreens on top added just the right balance of herby bite.  Pastas: SPAGHETTI. HOLY MOLY. Who knew that some plain spaghetti could have such nuanced and delicious flavors. I looked up the recipe online as soon as I got back to my hotel because you know this is making an appearance ASAP at home.  Pici with pesto and lobster. Very solid. I don't think this is an attempt-at-home pasta. It was excellent though.  Short rib agnolotti. Solid choice. Very flavorful.  For all the pastas, they were cooked PERFECTLY. Spaghetti really stole the show though.  Entree: I had the fennel dusted cod. Honestly I was already getting pretty full by then... so I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have without the pasta binge. However, it was cooked perfectly and the first few bites were delectable. I actually couldn't finish because after our shared app and pastas, I was already getting full. The accompanying veg were also expertly cooked and paired well with the fatty fish.  Everyone else opted for the duck, veal, and filet. Meat eaters I guess.  Desserts: PANNA COTTA. This was the second recipe I researched as soon as I got home. I am SO EXCITED to make this. Hawaii is my favorite place on earth and this is just hawaii in your mouth. Silky, smooth, and perfect.  Coconut, guava... so so tasty.  Chocolate souffle. I'm not the biggest souffle fan, but even I can appreciate the technical skill and mastery that went into the baking of our souffle. It came with a spiced choco sauce and cookie dough bites and fancy buncha crunch. It was delicious, just not my favorite.  I also had a perfectly crafted cappuccino.   In short.... can't wait to try the bev hills location.",

    "text": "Restaurant Week 2011. The wife and I only planned on going out only once for Restaurant Week, but after perusing all the menus we were persuaded to try one more place -- Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan. We were seated at a two-top by the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. One of the better views in town, it makes for a great spot for a romantic night out. The clean lines and modern motif of the restaurant interior add to the upscale and elegant atmosphere.  Scarpetta might have one of the best bread baskets around, but that can solely be attributed to the stromboli found within. Warm, chewy and delicious, it's almost a meal itself. The focaccia isn't bad either.  The first two dishes were yellowtail and polenta. The raw yellowtail consisted of four slices of fish topped with olio di zenzero, pickled red onions and microgreens. a couple slices were bland and under seasoned, while others were perfect. The other app ordered came on the recommendation of our waiter. And, I'm glad I listened to him. The creamy polenta came in a decent sized bowl along with a pot with truffled mushrooms fricassee, which the server promptly spooned into the polenta. The rich and savory dish was unlike any polenta I've had before.   The aged sirloin beef entree came sliced, cooked medium rare as ordered and was accompanied by a few light and fluffy potato gnocchi, wild mushrooms, barolo ragu, and topped with paper thin slices of parmigiano. The sirloin was good, but not nearly as good as the other entree.  The short rib agnolotti didn't look like much when it was placed on the table -- a shallow bowl filled with a modest amount of small stuffed pasta. But, the flavor from each bite was amazing. Each piece was a thin, delicate piece of pasta stuffed with tender short rib, with an intensely rich sauce. I loved the added texture that the bread crumbs added. It was a great dish on every level.  Desserts were tasty, as well. Amadei chocolate cake with toasted almond gelato and salted caramel sauce was dense and moist. The coconut panna cotta with coconut sorbetto, guava soup and pineapple was surprisingly light, creamy, and not too filling. It was a beautiful presentation with the guava soup covering and contrasting the panna cotta below.  Our service was a perfect compliment to our meal. Luis timed everything perfectly and provided the kind of personalized, friendly service that every top-notch restaurant should have.  I've had plenty of underwhelming experiences over the years for restaurant week, but this was definitely one of the best. I'm already thinking about when I'll be able to come back and hopefully enjoy more great food and service.",

The menu changes seasonally so any online searches may get you different or incorrect results.    The oysters to start were delicious and we shared bites of the braised short ribs of beef.  I had the stracci which is lobster, king crab, and shrimp over thin pasta.  It was good but a lot of pasta to eat.  I had the side of honey glazed carrots with roasted Sicilian pistachios which was very good.  Shared a bite of the brussel sprouts, but  not a fan so can't judge.  The cocktails and wine are extremely over-priced.  Markups on some bottles of wine were at least 300% and up.  I recommend a glass of your favorite to accentuate your email but this is no place to get your drink on.  Save your drinking $$ for after dinner out on the town.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Took care of us promptly and with enthusiasm.  Not sure I would return. There are many restaurants still to explore in Vegas, don't limit yourself!",

    "text": "Scarpetta features a very good ambiance with a fantastic view of the  Bellagio Fountains. To get a great view, make sure you ask to be seated by the window upon reservation. Ambience is dark, sexy and romantic, but different tables set different moods. They also have a booth section that is very secluded from the rest.   Starting with the notable wine list, I decided to pair my dinner with a glass of Malbec. Shortly after, our server brought us the bread basket. The bread basket consisted of foccacia, strombolli with warm meat and cheese, bread with herb, basic rolls and sourdough. Delicious!  They were served with mascarpone butter spread, citrus olive oil and eggplant spread.  Our server told us that they were best known for their spaghetti. Hmmm, must try that next time. For appetizer, we started with the raw yellowtail.  For our entrees, we ordered the duck foie gras ravioli  and prime NY steak. The yellowtail was very tender and refreshing. Used of rock salt gave it a unique after taste. I only wish there was more of it since it only came with 4 pieces.  The duck and foie gras ravioli was alright.   I absolutely wanted to love this dish due to the presence of foie gras, but I could barely taste the foie gras. The marsala reduction was a delightful contrast to the ravioli.  The steak was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, the way I like it. However, I can't say that it was the best I've ever had. Not even on my top three list.  It was served with seasonal vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, roasted potatoes, wild mushrooms and parmigiano. We were told the  mushrooms were shitake , trumpet royale, beech, and pecorino mushroom.   Since we were sharing everything, they were very accommodating by splitting everything for us.  The food timing was excellent! I wish I had more room for dessert but I was too full by the end of my meal. Overall, i enjoyed my dining experience at Scarpetta.",

    "text": "SCARPETTA....OH HOW I TRY TO AVOID YOU!  Yes that was deserving of all cap's.   So let me just take you back...oh say 5-6 years ago. I was living in NYC and somehow ended up at an \"italian restaurant\" with no sign (or a very small one) and had the best spaghetti...EVER. I was whisked away into the night without ever knowing the name of the restaurant/where it was (forgot, ugh).  Fast forward like oh... to a year ago when I had the pleasure of dining at Scarpetta here in Miami where I now live and A HA! I somehow had the same spaghetti that I had all those years ago. Immediately I'm like \"holy ___(insert adj here)____\" this is the best spaghetti...EVER and that was when my love/hate relationship with Scarpetta all began.  Love - in the sense that the food is heavenly and even after eating PASTA (carb overload), I yet still seem to be able to squeeze just a little bit extra onto my plate (whether it be dessert or what have you). It's not the type of pasta where you just peel over and die after because you just stuffed your stomach to maximum capacity. The flavors, heavenly. It's hard for me to justify paying for pasta. I feel like it's the absolute easiest dish to cook in the world (equivalent to a damn bowl of cereal) but at Scarpetta honestly, I would pay more. I stick with the regular spaghetti (trust me on this one).  Hate - in the sense that let's face it people...you're eating a plate full of carbs! Yes my body screams at me as I take every bite of the spaghetti...but it is like drug without the negative consequences (like oh say loosing your kids, family, job, and basically whole life). With this pasta, you just loose a few hours of your life while you are chained to a stair master all day to work it off. Believe me, if you haven't already figured this out by my review so far, let me break it down for you, it's worth it.  I suggested to my girlfriends that we all go to Scarpetta... - they're all like \"well you're the elite girl so we have to go where you want to eat\" (and this is coming from girls who only eat like salads) and I'm like ok this is our food cheat weekend, remember? (girls vacation) and they're like \"mmmhm\" and so then I'm all like \"SURPRISE! It's pasta time\" Well of course one of the girls was like \"ohhh hell no\" and stuck with her healthy fish (arctic char) but my other girlfriend caved and had the spaghetti with me (muy bien). The friend who had the arctic char (it was her first time eating it but went with it because of the suggestion from our waiter) really enjoyed it. She said it was absolutely delicious. The spaghetti? I don't even need to say...you already KNOW.  We had wine and mimosa's and blahblahblah it was amazing.  ALSO, I am not sure if this will still be available but there was a tasting course menu which looked TO DIE FOR. However, the entire table needs to ALL order it (duh) so if you have a group of people possibly looking for a course-tasting meal, DEFINITELY CALL AHEAD and get their menu for it. The spaghetti is ON IT along with scallops and a bunch of other things all for a very reasonable price (compared to other course tasting meals like say at ohh... Le Cirque).   Definitely try out Scarpetta. From start to finish, everything was perfect.",

    "text": "Was so excited to eat here. huge foodie and could not be more excited to eat here. dined at docg 2 times before and loved that restaurant, so was hoping would love scarpetta as well.   food did not disappoint at all. foie gras and duck ravioli like every one before said was amazing! was completely skeptical about this polenta dish as an app, but I'm sorry for ever doubting this app. it was so creamy and the mushrooms added so much to the dish only the chef would have thought of this. short rib agnolotti with horseradish holy moly. i LOVE horse radish and this was so amazing. brussel sprouts with pork belly were to die for. ppl who cook brussel sprouts correctly are 5 stars in my eyes.    the reason i gave 2 stars is the service. i almost gave 3 stars but the service really upset me. no spiel of the menu, server was an order taker and not a server. when greeted our table he said \"welcome amigos\" my girlfriend was at the table with my brother, are you kidding me? he had his hands on our 4th empty chair and that is so unprofessional. every server should have his or her own style however, \"amigo\" should not be in any style and laid back with leaning on a chair should not be either. never gave us suggestions, did not check back on courses, huge lack of service when check should have been presented, etc. he did not mark courses with proper silverware until after food was dropped. only positive note about service was the food runners. 2 thumbs up to the food runners, spieled the food, gave us smiles, friendly!!!   check was dropped as if it was a step of service, not real thank you from server, i still tipped 20+ % but was NOT happy to do so. I'm not expecting to be treated like a king but when paying nearly top dollar and excited to dine in this restaurant i was really disappointed. will not be going back to this restaurant 100% due to lack of great hospitality.   as stated before 2 thumbs up to the chefs and BOH staff and runners, but to my server, you should probably realize its just not just a paycheck you are collecting, if you want repeat guests you should probably try to provide good service.   so disappointed, wish i was more happy...",

    "text": "Had an interesting experience at scarpettas last night. After doing a lot of research on the Internet, we made reservations there for our 21st anniversary. When we arrived we were told their kitchen was closed due to a \"mishap\" but we could order from an alternate menu. We were a little confused but decided to go ahead since we were all dressed up and ready to eat. Once we were seated and looking at the menu, we realized that they were serving food from their sister restaurant next door. We were very disappointed since we've read so many good things about their food on yelp.     Then they brought out a complimentary appetizer which was very good. Had the meal and then they brought us 2 delicious desserts, one had \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. Very nice. Then the big surprise came when the waiter informed us that the meal was on the house!!!  Totally unexpected! maybe the waiter sensed our dissappointment earlier in the evening, but we hadn't complained at all.   So... I can't give an honest review of their food. However, the fact that they gave us our meal free says A LOT about how they feel about their customers. Very classy.  They made things right in a big way.   As for ambience... Very classy, dark, contemporary and cool. They sat us by the window with a nice view of the bellagio fountains.   Again, can't tell u about scarpettas food, but how can I not give them 5 stars when they treated my wife and I so well.",

    "text": "Yelp Fail.   This was my girlfriend's first time in Las Vegas, so I wanted to bring her to an upscale place and have her try some food from supposedly exclusive restaurants in vegas. Based on the yelp reviews, and time availability, I chose Scarpetta. It was a major disappointment, and I felt so bad bringing her to this establishment. This was the first restaurant experience she had in Vegas and it was horrendous.   Let me say that this review is based on three dishes that we had at Scarpetta.   1. Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli (main course) 2. Short Rib Agnolotti (main course) 3. Roasted Diver Scallops (appetizer)  Ambiance:  The seating and view were great. We were the table almost next to the window where the Belagio water show was going on. There was a great view of the show. The lighting was also dim. It is definitely a nice place to bring a date.  Price:  Despite the $$$, the prices are not too outrageous for Las Vegas. The main course dishes were 25 and 26 dollars while the roasted scallops were 23 dollars.   Service:  Service was horrible. We were there for over an hour. Our waiter checked up on us twice, once to bring more water and the second time to see if our food was ready. We waited for about 15-20 minutes to get our scallop appetizer. No apologies or more complementary bread. The wait for the food seemed the norm, as the tables next to us finished their food and were just making small talk while waiting for over 20 minutes. After we finished our scallops, we proceeded to wait another almost 30 minutes for our main course. Again, no apologies or further check ups. I ran out of water while waiting for our main course, during the appetizer, and did not get a refill until I had to ask for one (after the main course came). When we wanted to tell the waiter about the problems with our main courses, he and other waiters could not be found for about 20 minutes. We just sat there looking at each other and our plates (almost untouched). Simply horrible.  Food:  Scallops - these were actually very good. They were simple scallops that were fresh and cooked well. I would definitely get this again.  Duck and Foie Gras Ravioli - came out cold, tough, and very very very salty. We have had foie gras before, and this was well beyond what it was supposed to taste like. It left a bitter and salty taste in the mouth that could only be drowned out by eating the complimentary bread with their house tomato sauce. My girlfriend did not want to waste food so she tried to put the ravioli in her mouth followed by water as a chaser. She soon became sick and had to go to the bathroom. She only finished about 1/3 of the plate before I told her to stop.   Short Rib Agnolotti - gross. The noodles were tough and cold. The sauce made the bread crumbs stick to the noodles and caused the noodles to stick together like one giant pasta. I had trouble eating one bite of it. After finally taking a bit, the food was bland and left an unpleasant aftertaste. It was one of the worst dishes I have had in a long time. I am usually not too picky with pasta, but this Agnolotti was inedible. The noodles were rubbery hard and the sauce was cold and crusted onto the noodles. The appearance did not help. The food looked like someone threw up on the plate. The sauce was black or very dark brown (could not tell because of the dim lighting), but the appearance made the food even less appetizing.   Conclusion of the meal:  After about 20 minutes of the food being on the plate, almost completely untouched, the waiter came by to ask \"how was everything tasting.\" I told the waiter that the food was inedible and that it was probably the worst thing I've had in recent memory. The waiter's face was priceless. He did not seem shocked at all, rather, he just appeared to be apologetic. The waiter took the food off our table and asked if we wanted anything else. At this point, the restaurant was about to close and we did not want to wait another 30 minutes to get some inedible food. I told him to just give me the check so we can get out of there. They took the two dishes off our bill and our almost 2 hour meal came out to a whopping $23 (for the scallops). What a waste of time and appetite.  This trend of inedible food was not isolated to only our table table. While waiting for our food, the table behind us asked for the check and had two dishes that were inedible and left untouched as well. I did hear that the fish was decent from the table behind us, but that was the extent of praise Scarpetta's food received.   Overall:  I felt the need to write a long rant about this place. This dinner was supposed to be a happy and memorable event for my girlfriend because it was her very first dinner in vegas. Instead, it was only memorable because of how bad the restaurant service and food were. Considering there are a ton of great great places in vegas, I would highly advise anyone to pass on Scarpetta.",

I had to stop myself or I wouldn't have room to eat my main course.   I had the duck and foie gras ravioli. The pasta was cooked perfect and the filling was rich but a little too salty for me. The wine reduction added a good balance to the pasta.  But the star is definitely the spaghetti. It had an amazing flavor with a slight bite that goes very well with the perfectly cooked pasta.   The Amedei chocolate cake was delicious! It was a perfect balance of richness and decadence for a chocolate cake.   My biggest disappointment was the soda drinks. I asked if they had other soda options besides fountain like Gus and Dry sodas but Scarpetta doesn't. I asked for a Ginger Ale. Without notification and with my assumption that fountain drinks are unlimited refills, I had 4 tiny glasses of mostly ice and maybe 4 oz of soda. My soda bill was $16. I had the waiter removed the extra charges.  Overall, it was a great restaurant with good food, service, and view. I'll try it again but look at other drink options.",

We were a group of 13 girls and every single one of us raved about the food, service & experience. We had a long big table in the back in a private section of the restaurant. Our waiter was so gracious and patient (again we were 13 girls...). He made sure to explain the different dishes and suggested what he said were the favorites. Before our food came, the bread arrived. I think I would have still given the place 5 stars based on the bread. The salami cheese bread. Holy moly. SOOOO delicious. We shared a bunch of starters. The creamy polenta-to die for. You must order it if you only order one starter. The scallops were also so tasty & yummy. I tried most of the pasta dishes. The short rib agniolotti (sp?) very good with these delicious little horseradish crispies on top. The duck foie gras ravioli were also so good (definitely on the rich side). The spaghetti was great too but not my favorite i've ever had. The seafood pasta also was great. Now onto the desserts. You must you must you must order the caramel creme brulee. Amaaaazing. And the nutella little donuts were great too. I am definitely headed soon to the Scarpetta here!",
