    "text": "My wife and I were walking around Fremont Street and we were looking for a good happy hour place. Several places online recommend Nacho Daddy so we decided to check it out.   We ordered a few house margaritas from the happy hour menu as well as some nachos and chicken tacos. It's always annoying when places advertise their happy hour menu to get you in the door and then the servers seem so displeased with you for ordering from said menu. After we placed our order, we barely saw the bartender for the rest of the time we were there. It took us about twenty minutes to flag her down and get the check when we wanted to leave. We were forced to hang around even longer because she \"mistakenly\" didn't charge us the happy hour prices for our drinks. She made sure to make several other customers drinks before fixing our receipt. If you aren't going to treat all of your customers well, you should just get rid of happy hour.  The house margaritas were unsurprisingly mostly simple syrup. The chicken tacos and nachos were fine but not particularly memorable. While I liked the bar setup and the country music playing through the speakers, the food and the service make this place somewhere I would not recommend.",

The food was good enough, but the 4 cheese nachos were a waste of money, over half the nachos had no cheese on them. The traditional huevos rabcheros were a let down too, flavor was mediocre.  We didn't get napkins or forks until about a minute before the main dishes came out. So appetizers were messy LoL!  The tortilla soup was excellent and service and house drinks were good. The grilled hot wings were phenomenal. We do intend to go back and give it another try.  There were other dishes that people seemed to love. We want to try the filet mignon nachos and it was good enough. Closer to 3.5 stars for this visit. Will update after the next trip.",

It is a bit loud.  We went around 9:30pm so it was not that crowded.  We had the Supreme Tostada Nachos and the Vegetarian Cheese Enchilada (less cheese substitute with black beans).  The food was great.  Was the best nachos I have had in a long time.  They were loaded with toppings.  The best part about the Nachos was that it had the right amount to Cheese.  Most places overload the nachos with cheese.  The Enchilada's were better than average, nothing to write home about.   Nacho Daddy downtown would have received a five star review if it was not for our waitress.  She was rude and inattentive.  Mind you, the restaurant was almost empty.  I ordered a beer before I placed our dinner order.  The beer arrived after we started eating dinner.  She never came back to our table after that.  We had to track down our waitress for the check.  I will be back the next time I am in Vegas.",

To my recollection, our server was able to get everybody's drink order and brought them out fairly quickly. The margaritas here were a little on the sweet side.   I do remember scarfing down our monster loaded nachos and moved on to my buddy's pulled pork nachos. We were in and out pretty quick. My brother in law grabbed the bill so we did not have to go through trying to split the bill with 12 guys.",

Great experience right from the beginning. We sat at the bar and Natasha greeted us immediately upon sitting down. We told her we had never been before and she gave us the entire run down of the menu including her favorites and the favorites or the regulars. We ordered several of her suggestions including Daddy's Margarita and Michelada, the filet mignon nachos and the crab and lobster nachos! Everything was awesome. Food came out fast and hot. Natasha kept our drinks full the entire time and checked back with us regularly. Hope you guys bring one of these to Orlando! And some bartenders like Natasha!",

We all order some type of nachos and they were all good. My favorite was the delicious queso dip. My daddy wings were a little small and too breaded for my taste but the nachos were delicious.  I recommend sticking to Nachos or something on the menu with a star by it.",

If we wanted a table, it would've been a 30+ minute wait.   If you have the Yelp app on your phone, be sure to check in! You get a check offer for a free house margarita!   My friends and I decided to share the Supreme Tostada Nachos that pretty much had everything and we also shared the Mexican corn. As for drinks, I had their house margarita while my friends got a white peach margarita and blood orange margarita.   The nachos were very delicious. The flavor of everything blended together very well. The corn was okay. I've had better elsewhere. As for the drinks, to be completely honest, they all tasted pretty much the same to me. They all tasted like sweet and sour mixed with tequila. I couldn't really distinctly tasted the difference much. There were fruity flavors to them but the flavor was really light.   The only thing is that Nacho Daddy is a little bit on the pricey side. $17.50 for a plate of nachos with everything? Yowza. The margaritas run about $11-12 per. Granted, you're on Fremont street where it's mostly tourist so it's pretty much standard.   End point: pretty good food. Mediocre drinks.",

    "text": "If you go to a place called Nacho Daddy, you deserve what you get, don't you think? After all, who's your daddy anyway? Dining options were rather slim when we were strolling between the Fremont Street Experience and the Mob Museum. We noticed too late that Tony Gemignani opened one of his pizzerias, Pizza Rock, smack in the middle of the area, and we were already in shock over the sight of the Heart Attack Grill where they let people weighing at least 350 lbs eat for free. We were grateful we didn't meet that threshold.  By comparison, Nacho Daddy seemed like a downright demure dining destination in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. It's really just as much a bar as it is a place to eat although the menu is pretty robust with not only nachos but also breakfasts, burgers, wraps and other Mexican dishes. Jamie W. was hungrier than I was and ordered the $13.50 Vegan Burrito, which was a flour tortilla stuffed mostly with wild rice with bits of Cajun-spiced tofu, black beans, vegan cheese, diced peppers and onions, mushrooms, fire-roasted corn, avocado salsita and pico de gallo (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ZiHHn2&s=1314fa3989d0828fdb8a42119f6573518a9576e4cc9ddab8885f06f549553617\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1ZiHHn2</a>).  It was quite a pile in there, but it wasn't overly flavorful for all the ingredients. I just went with the $9.95 Flour Quesadilla which was just a flour tortilla with mozzarella cheese melted inside accompanied by a mini-scoop of sour cream and pico de gallo (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1RZtC8F&s=3b9623d9588a88e0a53307ac7ca74c377ce2237bc23dca41d031b0a279986c0a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1RZtC8F</a>). It was alright though something I could have made on a dorm hot plate a hundred years ago. We noticed the place start to fill up with regulars mostly around the bar, but I have to give props to the manager whom I think was the one serving us since the younger server was keeping busy entertaining the bar patrons.   FOOD - 3 stars...middling Mexican food maybe more satisfying after a stint at the bar AMBIANCE - 3 stars...nothing special, kinda Tex-Mex in feel SERVICE - 4 stars...for the unexpectedly efficient server TOTAL - - 3 stars...now who's your nacho daddy now?",

For dinner I  had the fish tacos, and they were so good and fresh, especially the hand made flour tortillas. They were amazing. I was so full but I had to have the fried ice cream.

I'm a big fan of heuvos rancheros, and where we live it's not easy to find and if you do not very good. What can say is they didn't disappoint, traditional with salsa, guacamole, and the bean made to perfection. When go back it might be hard not to order them again.",

Obviously our food also had been forgotten as that took around 45 minutes. Poor poor service, if you recognize you made a mistake don't try and hide it, acknowledge it by offering a free drink or take a meal charge off the bill.

I walked in with a drink from another place, and he rudely told me to take my drink \"out\". I was with a group of friends, and I was not going to hand him my drink (since I had just bought it).

We came here with a large group last weekend and wanted to wait the 40 mins the hostess told us. 40 mins passed, nothing. 50 mins, nothing. Hour and 10 mins, nothing. I asked her if it'd be much longer as we were all starving. She kept lying saying, \"they're almost gone\" \"they have boxes\" \"they're paying for their food\". After 1 1/2 hours, they finally sat us at a table that had been empty the entire time. Even the table behind that was empty.   I get they probably didn't have the wait staff...on a Saturday. But that's why I kindly asked her to be honest with me because we would have rather gone elsewhere for quick food. She just kept stringing us along. That shit was not cool and extremely bad business.   It really pissed everyone off to where we didn't even enjoy anything at that point.   Horrible hostess. Horrible customer service. I usually refer so many people here to eat. No more.",

When we asked the hostess about the open tables she said they were for large parties.........but the 2 hours we were there zero large parties came in. However over 8 groups of people walked away when they heard 30-40 minute wait times. All that lost revenue and empty tables.....? Makes zero business sense. We are loyal customers and have eaten at one of the 3 locations over a dozen times in the last year. Sadly this location will not be on that list in the future. Tip go to the one at Planet Hollywood. They are more organized and have friendlier staff. Food good, service disappointing.",

All you have to do is show them that you checked in and you get a free margarita on the rocks! It was served in a Ball jar and was one of the best margs I've had.   Had a waiter named Rico. He was super cool. Very attentive and helpful.   I wasn't very hungry, so I just ordered the trio of guac, queso, and salsa. The queso was sooo good. I also am a baby when it comes to spice and I could eat the medium salsa just fine. Guac is ok and kinda bland, but if you mix it with the cheese its great.",

However, on our drive back home we made sure to stop in Vegas, specifically at Nacho Daddy because we knew we couldn't pass up a chance to eat here.   Nacho Daddy did not disappoint, there was such a wide variety of options to choose from. I got the enchilada nachos and they did not disappoint. The portion was HUGE and the flavor was incredible.   As for the location itself, the servers were extremely attentive and made sure we always had water. In addition, there's TV located all around playing either sports or music videos. We were seated next to a music video tv and my friends and I had a lot of fun guessing the name of the songs/artists since the videos were older.   From the food to the atmosphere, it was an incredibly fun and worthwhile experience. I would come back to Nacho Daddy in a heartbeat.",

What I love most about them is that if you purchase one of their entrees, they partner with the local food bank Three Square and donate a meal.

I think everyone enjoyed their food enough, and they got huuuuuge portions!   Overall, the service was ok.

Pretty much everything was spicy - so we kept drinking water. The waiter couldn't refill our drinks fast enough - not his fault, but the food was delicious!!! I highly recommend the lobster & crab and the shrimp street taco. I wasn't expecting it to be so good, but it was. Our check arrived and it was less than $25- not bad at all.

We were initially told the wait was 45 minutes, but got a text in 5 minutes letting us know that our seats were ready. Checking in on Yelp gets you a free regular margarita.  The wife wanted a fancier margarita,  so our server applied the cost of the free margarita to the one my wife wanted. Mark was our server,  who was great and very attentive. With a place called Nacho Daddy, how can you not try the nachos? We opted for ther filet mignon nachos which were super good. You get a healthy sized portion so it's nice and filling with lots of toppings.  We also tried the spicy grilled wings which were crazy hot and delicious. They were fire,  so if you like them hot definitely try those bad boys out.  They had multiple TVs so you can catch sporting events while you eat.  Overall we had an awesome experience,  and we will definitely come back again.",

I wasn't too particular for the seasoning on my beef tacos kinda reminded me of taco bells beef.  I decided to finish my daughters quesadilla and tackle the tacos later.

If you have all the time in the world to push back, this is your place; nevertheless, I hope this doesn't happen to you. I want this place to be great, but we have been forgotten, set aside, and felt like \"we were lucky to be here.\" Again, I'm hoping this is an incident that's just got carried away....",

You can taste the use of high quality ingredients and they don't skimp on the portions either.  Very well worth the wait and great value for your buck. Tried the nachos of the month with the daddy margarita! Absolutely a great pair. Margarita was perfect and I'm not a usual margarita person. Not too strong, you can actually taste something besides the alcohol. And also tried the scorpion shot! It was great something not offered in other places in Vegas, that i know of yet. I like to chew the scorpion, unique texture for sure and you get extra tequila flavor when chewing. The tequila used in the shot is so smooth I would definitely get it again.  This is a must try spot for drinks and specially nachos!",

Queso, Salsa and guacamole for the win! I usually get the fiesta nachos although it was a little heavier on the redress beans so will omit them next time. Parking is easy downtown but beware your time limits for upcharges. The restaurant is around the alley and is an eye sore but worth it. Lost a star for service although my waiter was great. The appetizer came after the meal. The host quoted us 5 min to clean off a table. 15 minutes later she comes back from her \"break?\" and seats us in the same open table we saw walking in. While waiting, waiters walked passed us back and forth without uttering a hello. Finally the woman bartender was friendly enough to see that we were still awaiting seating. (Not crowded @ 6pm). Will return but def would prefer more courtesies in the service.",

They got us drinks & our food order but then.. Nothing.. I work in restaurants, I hate when people have to flag me down.  We started with the amazing spicy shrimp nachos, hands down some of the best nachos I've ever had, piping hot & full of flavor   Then.. We waited..   Ignored by the guy bartender while the girl bartender ate food in plain sight. I understand you have to eat but in front of customers?  We continued to wait.. With empty waters (we were having cocktails too)   When we received our fajitas, they were cold. I shouldn't be able to touch the cast iron they're served on. I had to be that person to flag the one bartender down, not sure of his name, he had a small curly rat tail hairstyle. I told him they were cold, he looked surprised, they weren't sizzling like fajitas should be, so he took them back. They brought out what I assume we're the same fajitas just reheated somehow. They were ridiculously greasy & lackluster.   The salsas served with the chips were delicious and spicy..  Highlights- shrimp nachos/chips & salsa  downfalls- bartenders, ignoring us/ cold fajitas   We are going to try a different location & see if it's better",

I went today as my first stop to Vegas and ordered nachos. We asked for some extra cheese sauce, and after waiting awhile never received it. The waiter continuously checked on us, and at the end the manager took our whole nacho order off the bill. It was such wonderful customer service and after already loving this place, I can only say this MUST be a stop for everyone in Vegas. Love love love this place!!",

In any case, I am a fan of that particular selection, although their burger nachos and chicken fried steak/egg breakfast nachos are no slouch either.  A decent little location just across the way from the Neonopolis, and nestled well within Fremont Street, I liked the low-key vibe there, with their poppy music videos on the TV, and a pretty tasty Bloody Mary (also of note, their coffee selection is excellent).  The service is friendly and keeps tabs on you.  Prices are reasonable, and portions are BIG.  Come hungry, for they will hook you up if you are suffering any sort of nacho deficiency.    In any case, I took it upon myself to visit this location four times over two weeks, if that tells you anything, and now that I'm thinking on it, some buffalo chicken nachos do sound remarkable tasty right about now.  They need delivery.  Because as strong as my need for nachos is, I'm not feeling the cold right now.  We need to work this out, Nacho Daddy....",

My husband ordered a beer and I had a Daddy's Michelada which was really good. I also ordered some mojo pork street tacos and my husband ordered the wings. He said the wings were good and my tacos were good but not great. I've had way better tacos in California so my standards are pretty high. Maybe I should have ordered Nachos since that is what they are known for. Overall it was a good experience and I would go again. If my tacos were amazing I would have given it 5 stars.",

And no, it is not a nightmare, because the nachos here are so good I can't think of a better place to perish than in the gooey goodness of a soggy, cheese-smothered tortilla chip from Nacho Daddy.  Before you ready any further, take a moment to appreciate the pun of the name.  ...It took me a while at first, so just want to make sure we're all on the same page.  BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS. BREAKFAST NACHOS.  So the chicken fried steak breakfast nachos are in my top ten favorite dishes of all time. I was even inspired to make a version for my friends on a few occasions to great success, but I haven't come close to beating the original.  The one drawback to this place is the service. When we did get service it was great, but the waitstaff/bartenders were spread thin and trips to our table were few and far between.  Even so, you neeeeeed to go here if you find yourself in downtown vegas. Back to dreaming about the next time I get to visit here.",

    "text": "This experience wasn't bad, but it definitely could have been better.  My wife and I were going to a concert nearby and wanted to grab a bite to eat before the show. She was in the mood for nachos, so coming here was a no-brainer.   Upon entering, we were thrown off by having to seat ourselves. It was kind of packed, so finding a table in the back took a minute. There was a large party in the center that seemed to be taking up everyone's attention, so it was about 5 minutes before we even got menus and another 5 before we got to speak with our server.  Fortunately, that gave us time to decide what we wanted to order, so we ordered as soon as he arrived.   It took nearly 45 minutes to get our food, but again, that was due to the large party in the center. The food was fresh when it arrived, but was mediocre at best.   Her nachos were over-saturated with this extremely spicy salsa. The amount of cheese on the nachos gave the impression that ANY cheese on there was merely an accident. It was primarily a plate of chips and salsa, garnished with chicken and a few vegetables.    I ordered the fish and chips. The fish was amazing. The fries were great while they were piping hot. However, as soon as they cooled down, they became hard as a rock and hazardous to my health. I couldn't finish even half of them (and there weren't a lot to begin with).   The part that gives this experience 3 stars (and not 1 or 2, as the food was quite a disappointment) was the service. Our server was Danny, and the little amount of service the party in the center allowed him to give us was excellent.   Overall, it was a decent experience. Not one I intend to repeat any time soon, though.",

And I'm glad we did!!! The service was great it was after 2am on Saturday night and everyone was great. We had chicken enchiladas, queso dip with tortillas and a huge burrito and everything was amazing! We will for sure go back next time we are in Vegas and will make sure we tell all our friends to stop by when they are there!!! Thank you!!!",

Started with a white peach margaritas that, although sweet, was so good I ended up having three!  For a shared appetizer, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed a plate of pulled pork nachos.  Griffin, our excellent waiter, said he'd get the bbq sauce on the side because the kitchen can sometimes be heavy-handed with it, which was perfect, as my husband and I have differing levels of love for it. The nachos were spot on. So good that I nearly ordered a second variety as my entree!  Wayne ate fajita cheese steak with parmesan garlic fries. I had fajita chimichanga with green sauce. Both were outstanding.  We will be making Nacho Daddy's a regular stop on our annual trip out here from now on.",

First off all they start with a homemade flour tortilla that is lightly grilled to perfection , they proceed to stuff it full with juicy marinated steak , mozzarella cheese , roasted anaheim salsa and then top it off with cilantro , it also comes with refried beans and Mexican rice . This Supreme Taco is very moist and sooooo amazing . It's definitely my favorite menu item . I've also had the Seasoned Ribeye , and OH MY GOD , it was perfectly seasoned and so tender that it melted in my mouth . They are not a steak house so I was surprised as to how delicious the Ribeye was . I'm going to say its one of the best I've ever had here in Las Vegas .  The local vibe here is great and the service was perfectly on key . My drink is always kept full and the staff is very personable . You must come by and try this place out !!",

I could eat these things for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and when I happen to wake up at midnight and I'm looking for a snack. Not to mention the astounding amount of knowledge of their liqueurs, can't say I have a negative thing so say about this place. Don't get me wrong, they get huge groups which could make the wait times a little long, we're all human and can accept that. Hands down my favorite place to gorge myself and consume booze downtown.

She brought 2 waters out for my hubs and I (we got there first)  and forgot to put ice in ONE of them She checked on us once during the meal,  and we had to flag someone down for the check.  Then they gave us our check AND someone else's.  It wasn't extraordinarily busy, so I'm not sure what the problem was.  Overall,  I probably won't rush to go back.  Kind of overpriced for decent (not great) food, and bad service.  If we do go again,  it will be a different location!",

After sampling some of their delicious bbq nachos at the last yelp event, I was eager to go here.  I finally got my chance yesterday 11-15-15 at 11:30 AM.  This restaurant is located on 4th street which is right smack dab in the middle of the fremont street madness.  We parked in the fremont parking garage and it cost $2.    $35.74 got me a bloody mary, a triple dip appetizer, and a barbecue pulled pork sandwich.  Our server, Jon, was very attentive and brought us a high chair, crayons, and a kids menu for the boy.    The bloody mary experience was unique to me....it was a bloody mary DIY bar.  For $8 they give you a mason jar with ice and Absolut in it, and then you go up to the bar and make it the way you want it.  They had bloody mary mix, pickles, celery, hot sauces, cucumbers, olives, lemons, etc. I thought that was pretty neat.    The triple dip ($11.95) consisted of white queso dip, guac, and salsa, and it came with the world's saltiest chips (see photo).  That queso dip....oh wow....I wish I could fill up a jacuzzi with it and drink my way out.  It was heavenly.  Their guac, however, was yucky.  It tasted like the kind you can buy at Wal-mart.  I would have given this place 5 stars if their guac was good and I didn't have to wade through smelly street performers to get there.    The pulled pork sandwich was awesome...so juicy and messy!  It came with piping hot fries that I really enjoyed dipping in the queso dip.  My only critique would be that the pork was in large chunks and I prefer it more shredded.    Yay! I'm a fan.  Next time I'm getting the buffalo nachos and street corn.",

We came in on a Sunday, ordered nachos and waited an hour plus for them to be ready--I'm pretty sure our bartender, Taeilor, forgot to ring them in. No one even apologized for the wait. Usually, being in the food industry myself, I'm very understanding of busy shifts, but this was ridiculous. I understand that she was busy for a Sunday football shift, but her attitude was unwarranted. Highly suggest the food, maybe we just came on the wrong day? Hopefully she can pick it up next time.",

My friend and I went many times when we were there because of their vegan menu. It was tough a couple of times service wise. But one time our waitress (who was such a sweetheart! I don't remember her name but she was a lovely, thin yoga teaching girl) was trying so hard to make sure we got our food and drink in a timely matter. The bartender was too busy not paying attention to the orders, and then they ran out of margarita stuff! We were there for punk rock bowling, and I guess the manager (who you could tell was there wearing some hideous lilac colored shirt, really dude?), was too busy sitting on his phone to notice his staff was running around trying to do the work of 5 people per person.   Long story short, food is awesome, drinks... awesome. The waitstaff, fantastic. But man, I hope they're more prepared next year so I don't have to wait 30 minutes for my food and or margarita.",

I had the nachos and a taco. Let's start with the nachos:  The only reason I cant give this place 5 stars is because there are a LOT of bare chips on the pile of nachos they bring you. In fact, when I received it I was quite surprised to discover how many NOT covered chips there were. They could have done away with about two thirds of the chips, but they basically use the chips as a way to present you with a pile high plate, even though the good stuff is not as plentiful as it could have been. Still delicious. Just not as \"Oh my God\" as I was lead to believe.  Now for the taco: I had the barbacoa taco - Now this deserves the \"OH MY GOD!!\" It was DELICIOUS!! In fact, I wish I had ordered a couple more and NOT gotten the nachos. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY!! And the tortilla was a thick one, that had been slightly grilled and delicious.  A good time was had and it was a really fun place right off of Freemont street.",

Our server, Luis, was a rockstar. He made us feel at home in a strange city, and managed to get food out to all of his tables quickly while still having time to chat and get to know us. His margarita suggestion was taken, and enjoyed. My spicy vegan burrito was one of the best burritos I have ever eaten.  We loved this place so much, we went back the next day! Luis was our server again, the food was amazing again, and the equally awesome manager, Tyler, even gave us a yummy churro sunday on the house! At that point I just wanted to move in. I don't throw 5 star reviews around willy nilly, but they deserve it. I can't think of any reason a person should not come here.

I ordered the wild rice which seems to have come from a box and loaded with msg. Had the server to remove it from the check as I did not eat it after examining it. The black beans were good. Again, it seems msg is what gives this food any kind of flavor. My companion had the queso served with chips and a heat lamp and ground beef. She said it was ok if you were intoxicated.The brighter side is our server. He was amazing! Very attentive and fast. Took care of things as needed very quickly and with a smile.

Once we finally did, it took 35 minutes to receive our food! We ordered the queso dip (which we asked to be brought before everything considering it is an appetizer), but it came with everything at the same time. Also, the three tables that were seated at least 15 minutes after us received their food far earlier than we did, which did not make sense. The queso was good, but only when it was hot. After that it had some sort of funky after taste. The kale salad was incredibly bland and disappointing. The fiesta nachos were okay but not anything close to what I expected them to be. Overall, we left nacho daddy with queasy stomachs and had to end our night there. Definitely not how you want to spend Vegas.",

Friendly staff, from hostess to waiters. We enjoyed it.",

I was helped by a young lady and a trainee, but my combo order was still missing a few things.  I had ordered a second beer, but that didn't make an appearance until I was well over with my dinner. I would understand if it was busy, but that wasn't the case. The group of people next to my booth were having the same issues, and had even had their tray of food knocked over by a server. Communication is key. This place still gets kudos because I know the staff was putting in effort to make sure my visit was great.",

Large portion, quick delivery (even though there were 20 people in my party) and such great customer service! Definitely recommend!!!",

Also grab some street tacos off the appetizer menu. Small snack size tacos. Pick any meat to be served in two thin corn tortillas. The chicken meat was perfectly grilled and slightly burnt which gave the perfect amount of crunch. Yum!  This located is located a little turn off Fremont street.

    "text": "That's Nachos, that's mine!  After surveying the LONG line at our first choice restaurant (on our first night in Vegas), we nixed that idea and looked to the trusty Yelp app for another suggestion.  Thank goodness Nacho Daddy was open late that night to appease our hunger pains.  1.  Yes, they're open late!  Thank goodness.  We visited for late night dinner on 9/30/18 and I believe they were open till 200am.  Those looking for a late meal (like we were) will be rejoicing I'm sure.  2.  Yes, they do have nachos on the menu.....of course, that was practically a given.  To be brutally honest, the menu extended beyond the nachos section/list, but my friend and I didn't look elsewhere.  We came for nachos.  That's all.  We ended up ordering the Fajita nachos, which was the special that night.  The server was very accommodating when we asked to have all the spicy components of the dish served on the side.  The nachos was a very generous portion.  So, so good.   3.  Yes, do order a drink!  We ordered the Daddy Margarita, which happened to be a reduced price in conjunction with our Fajita nachos order.  $4 a glass versus $10.  Admittedly, the glass was enormous!  Omg. I was absolutely taken aback.  Thank goodness we weren't driving.  4.  Yes, the service was excellent!  Aside from the hostess who didn't seem to want to seat us (she strongly HINTED at the open seats at the bar), everyone we encountered at NDD provided exceptional customer service.  I wish I remembered the server's name because he was extremely friendly and polite.    BOTTOM LINE: Late hours.  Wonderful service.  Tasty nachos.  Good margaritas!  I will be back if I find myself in DTLV in the near future.",

However, we waited a very long time for a waiter to come by and take our order (20mins) then another 30-45 for our food. Loud ambiance. Read further for details.   They had a yelp deal where if you check in you get a free margarita which the waiter clarified as their house margarita and if you wanna upgrade you can minus the $8 (price of the house margarita) from whichever you choose and pay the difference. I chose the house margarita as the chimichanga was already $13 and it wasn't great, tasted like margarita mix poured into a glass, I would recommend trying one of the others if you do.   The nacho and chimichanga portions were quite large, even my friend who's near 200lbs and has a definite appetite couldn't finish the fiesta nachos. The other dishes were average sized.   The chimichanga was average nothing special, however I did like that the guac and sour cream wasn't just in a scoop it was spread along the chimichanga. But it also had a scoop or guac on top.   The ambiance is quite loud, but I guess what do you expect being in DTLV.",

Three of us were ordering the skinny margarita so we decided to get a pitcher. After pouring and tasting we noticed a bubbly in the drink. The skinny margarita simply lists tequila, lime juice, and agave. I was not happy. Brought it to the attention of the waitress who apologized profusely and brought a new pitcher. This pitcher only yielded four 8 oz. glasses with ice because the pitcher was filled to the top with ice. I felt duped and very upset. I did not complain again because we had brought newbies and I already felt bad for having talked up the place so much.  I was truly disappointed in my experience at Nacho Daddy.",

I also tried a bit of the vegan chick'n fajitas, which were great, but I was so full by that point that we couldn't finish that dish. The portion sizes were sizable for the price point.

Our waiter, Rico, was very patient and sweet with our big group without being overbearing.  The food was... okay. At least my meal was. I ordered the Baja shrimp burrito, and it was FULL of onion and cilantro- too much so. The shrimp itself, though, was very good, big and flavorful. The prices were reasonable as well, my burrito was $14.95. My margarita was a little on the sweet side and not much alcohol, but it was free with my Yelp check in, so I can't complain too much.   I don't know that Nacho Daddy would be my first choice Downtown, but I wasn't upset about the experience.",

    "text": "Came for late dinner on a Friday night. We were told by the sassy hostess that there'd be a 30 minute wait. When we asked if we could have a seat at the bar she abruptly ran inside to the bar as if it was not first come first serve. If this is the case, that would be super weird. We opted to wait. Seems like the sassy short little hostess sensed our frustration; one minute into the wait she ran over to me and stated she had a table and could now seat us.  The service was good and so was the food. We ordered filet mignon nachos and chicken enchiladas with green sauce to share. The star of the show to me with the fillet mignon nachos.   This is a good place to grab a bite if you're in downtown Las Vegas. Just be willing to look past any unnecessary attitude from the hostess.",

My family was visiting from out of town and I decided to book a reservation online since it was the weekend and with this location being downtown I anticipated it to be packed. Boy was I right! It pays to be proactive in these kind of situations...  When we arrived our party of 6 was greeted by the friendly hostess outside and from there, seated right away! Shortly after are awesome server came over I believe his name was Erick but he spelled it with an A.. like Aerick or something? Anyways he was really pleasant to have on this dining experience. Super attentive, funny and just all around the perfect server.   For drinks we started off with a few margaritas and I used the Yelp check in margarita option with an upgraded tequila.. second round with with a top shelf Cadillac margarita and it was the bomb! Made Just how I like it!   Food was delicious we ordered:  Chicken Enchiladas- Tender chicken wrapped up in two thick corn tortillas, smothered in red or green enchilada sauce, Monterey jack cheddar cheese & sour cream.  Smothered Burrito- Flour tortilla stuffed with your favorite protein, refried beans, Mexican rice, Monterrey jack & cheddar cheese smothered in your choice of red or green enchilada sauce. Served with sour cream, guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo & house-made Chips.   Mix & Match (Any 2) Fajitas - Filet Mignon & Grilled Shrimp. Served with fajita peppers & onions, cherry tomato pico de gallo, sour cream & guacamole with a side of Mexican rice & refried beans, flamed tableside. Choice of flour or corn tortillas & Daddy's salsa.  Nacho Daddy For The Win!!!",

This world where everyone's favorite food group (that's right, FOOD GROUP) is not only featured, but the focus of their menu. How awesome is that? Could it get more awesome? Yes it could (if they put one in San Diego) being in Vegas is pretty amazing!   Located in Downtown Fremont, it is pretty convenient, especially if you're in the Nacho mood. Patio seating with an aircraft hangar style door, also a great centrally located industrial concrete bar, and warm sunlight.   Because we seemingly don't know how to settle for a stock off the menu selection we went with the Supreme Tostada Nacho, but asked for the pico on the side and also a side of the enchilada sauce, but without the lettuce (cause that did seem weird, right?). First, how awesome was the bartender? They brought out our order and he immediately noticed the presence of lettuce and threw up the stop sign. All apologies, it was returned to the kitchen and a fresh prepped replacement was brought shortly thereafter. Second, these were the best nachos ever!!!! Ermergosh! Such a great blend of flavors and I was halfway through the order, before I remembered we had the sides. Unfortunately, I had waited so long that the enchilada sauce had cooled before I got to it, because I'm sure warmer would have been better (still pretty good).   I digress, let me finish this thing. Aside from amazing nachos, the bar hosts plenty of tequila (as they should), some decent beer (some local), and a friendly, smiling, engaging, conversational, smart, fun staff. Who wouldn't want to be here, eat here, roll around in a pool of nachos here?",

Never checked on again after food was served and then check was incorrect. Tried again this trip. Asked to sit outside, and she said ok rolled her eyes and said she will see if she can find someone to serve us. Sat for 20 minutes servers went out to tables on either side of us and would say hi in passing but never asked about drinks or anything. So we just left.",

It took a minute to get seated (that is a good sign when a place is busy), but we were greeted almost right away by Palynn (under pressure with a long line she was great!) and seated as soon as possible. We ordered the ahi nachos. AMAZING!!!!  All of the food is fresh and quality ingredients. Not cheap cuttin corners food. Really good food. And our server Casey was fantastic. The place was packed. She was super busy, but checked in with us frequently and made sure we were happy. My daughter said this place is on her list now of places we need to come back to!  And she's a tougher critic than I am!  Definitely check this place out and wait in line if there is one because it's worth the wait.",

The portions are huge,  the menu is simple to understand,  and the atmosphere is welcoming.    With a location a few steps away from the Downtown Grand,  you can stumble your way here with ease,  and then catch your Uber home.    They have a lot of non - traditional Nacho options,  a little something for everyone.  My friends and i tried:  Golden knight Nachos- more of a traditional loaded nacho  Buffalo chicken nacho - fun and novelty kind of nacho  Pulled pork bbq nacho - interesting but delicious flavor combo.    I would definitely be back when my cravings get out of control",

Keep in mind i have been to nacho Daddy many times for Monday margaritas with some of my customers and coworkers so i was confused on what was going on. She went to a table next to us and tried to kicked them out and then when she realized it was the wrong table. Then got aggressive with me and told me her manager 86'd me. I have never met the manager either. I asked her to let me talk to them and she denied, she got all of my friends including the birthday girl out.. It is really unprofessional that you might get kicked out of a place because a waitress has a personal problem.",

We just barely finished the whole plate and it was the perfect amount to split. It was just before dinner time so there was no wait and even if there was, it would have been worth it.

I ordered the Anaheim taco which consists of Anaheim chilies, sour cream, sauteed onions, a blend of three cheeses, a slice of avocado all placed on a taco with scrambled egg.  The taco was not a flour one.  It was more like a pastry crust rather than a flour tortilla, but it was very good.  The menu says that all breakfast tacos are served with potatoes or refried beans and rice.  I was offered neither.  I did have a choice of mild, medium, or hot for the salsa and I chose hot.  It's mildly hot if that's not an oxymoron. Breakfast was good and the server refilled my coffee when he saw I was getting low.  This place just opened a month ago and they're still doing work on it.  This morning, they were installing a garage door in the bar area that can be raised in good weather and serve from a counter on which the door rested today.  Part of the fun of eating here today was watching my server change the Coke cartridges.  The syrup now comes in super concentrated containers that look like copy machine cartridges and it was interesting watching him switch out two of the cartridges. The change in technology was interesting.  I parked underground in the Neonopolis garage and there was no charge.  I don't know if it's because of the time of day or that I was there less than an hour, but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wished me a good day and opened the gate.  Nacho Daddy is worth a return visit when they get the kinks worked out. And gentlemen, aim for a field goal!",

And I have no idea what kind of beer was used since the waitress didn't ask me. The filet minon nachos were ok. Nuthin to write home about. The meat was not as tender as I had hoped. Crab & lobster street tacos were ok, they stuff more corn in it than the crab/lobster. But they were tasty.  This place was just 'OK'  I think the pics are amazing but unfortunately the taste isn't.",

(We went to the original location in Henderson many times before this one, though; so imagine my excitement when there was one closer to home!) I must've forgotten to do a review on this place. This is one of my favorite places to get nachos, my favorite pig-out food. (I have a restricted diet monday through friday.)   My favorite place to get nachos used to be Mickie Finnz but honestly, there is no other place to get nachos anymore. Out of the fifteen nacho types, we've tried about eight of them! Our favorite is \"Nacho Average Burger Nacho.\"  Doesn't look very big from the outside, but when you get inside, the bar is on the left side (probably bigger than the dining area), and the sit-down dining area is on the right side. The bathrooms are at the very back, right side. The counter (where to go for your takeout order) is to the right, front side, of the restaurant. Every server we've had has been very nice.   Not much parking, but a couple spaces in front, if you're lucky, for the takeout order.",

I had been craving a chimi for years and the sweet server said he would go back and ask if they could do a vegan one....of course they could! I ordered a bean and cheeze and avocado chimi :D I wish I took a pic of it it was soooo yummy and gooey and ridiculous :D I asked for black beans with mango salsa on top as my side.   Anyway, this place will make you just about anything you want. I even requested the kale salad be put into a wrap before and yep they did it.  Service is slow sometimes but always pleasant. The owner is a sweetheart, glad he left what he was doing to open his Nacho Daddy's ;)   We had a Yelp event at the one at Henderson and after that we tried Hendo location again after that....ummmm we are not a fan.   We have had some yummy veggie fajitas here also (don't know if they are a menu item). You can't beat their nachos. I wish they had a cauliflower buffalo vegan nacho like I have made at home then I would truly be in heaven. My fav item is still the kale salad. It's that dressing, that grilled corn, delicious.   That spicy tofu burrito is out of this world but wow it's freaking spicy I don't know how my bro in law nor my hubby eats that. They always inhale theirs.  I'm not a fan of adult drinks and hubby is allergic to tequila (in an oopma loompa turning orange type of way) so not really sure about their margs etc but my friend said her special tooty fruity marg was super yum and super strong.   Nacho Daddy IS the Nacho Daddy.",

We went for a late lunch, & there weren't very many people in there at all, but the service was slow, & they also forgot a few items we ordered. If service wasn't so bad I would've given 5 stars.",

I had the huevos rancheros (breakfast all day!!) it was so good I ate way beyond full.  They serve it with gauc and salsa, both were great, but totally unnecessary-the huevos were perfect as is. Oh, Oh, Oh! They made my eggs perfectly over medium.  I don't know if you've ever ordered over medium eggs before but it's quite the gamble.  Kudos to the cooks! My partner in crime ordered the Nachos and walked out with a food baby as well.  He had some super tasty raspberry margarita which totally trumped my guava daiquiri.    On a side note: Our server was pretty much MIA during the meal but this was obviously due to the fact that she was in the weeds.  I think she may have been the only one on.  The food would definitely bring me back but not having anyone check on us until we were almost done eating would keep me away.  Hopefully it was a fluke and not standard practice!",

When we asked about making a new one or returning it they just flippantly said that's the way they make them, $10 down the drain.  I know it's hard to find good help but the server just had no clue about customer service, pick up the straw paper, take our dirty dishes that have been sitting here for half an hour while we're waiting for our check (again, not busy at all) bring us napkins and silverware. You don't think it's odd when you bring us a plate of food and there's nothing on the table?  They slung our plates on the table and ran forcing us to yell at them to ask for napkins and silverware. Of course that wasn't his job, so he said he would get our server to help us with our problem.",

I was contented. I would like to explore the menu more.   Whilst in Vegas, hop over to Nacho Daddy. You'll be glad you did.",

It comes with guac, sour cream, and pico. They put the same cheese sauce from the nachos in the quesadilla, so that's a nice change from traditional vegan cheese. For the cost, $12+, it could have included a couple more triangles instead of 4, but it was satiating at least.  I will return again, but will most likely just order the nachos again, because you get more for your money with that dish.",

The elote was a little sweet for my taste.  I felt like it needed some hot sauce.  My friend who ordered it however, was in love.  She said it's better than the elote she makes herself.  We checked in for 2 house margaritas which were pretty good.  The only reason I took off a star is because when we were sat, we were told someone was going to be our server.  We waited around for 20 mins before another server came up to us and said the guy we were supposed to have is too busy so she'd help us.  Turns out the guy who was supposed to be our server was just chatting with a couple tables directly behind us.  It was kind of weird.  Next time I'll try the other location.  Hopefully a little bit more organized!",

We decided to eat the Supreme tostada nacho's, which was basically a classic with some surprises. The beef is seasoned perfectly, and they serve it with something they call avocado lime salsita, it was perfect.  The day we were there, they didn't have the corn-on-the-cob, it was off the cob, but for real, it was the best tasting Mexican style corn ever. We could eat here every other day, no joke, I can't wait to go back and try the BBQ pulled pork nachos!",

The downtown location is smaller and more noisy than the Summerlin location, but it's a fun atmosphere and easy to find if you're down on Fremont Street.  They offer a good selection of margaritas, from sweet to classic flavors.  I always go with Daddy's margarita and it is probably my favorite margarita I've discovered in town!  Very refreshing and flavorful!  Of course, they specialize in nachos but they also offer other classic Mexican food plates from fajitas to enchiladas and tacos.  I have tried quite a few of the nacho plates and my favorite is the Thai chicken nacho!!  It's packed with flavor and has just the right amount of spiciness to it!  Our waiter Dean was very attentive and polite.  We came in on Friday night for National Margarita Day and the Golden Knights game so the place was very busy. Dean still managed all of his tables with great service while training a new waiter, props to him!  You will not be disappointed if you choose to come here for dinner or just to have a margarita at the bar.  This will definitely not be my last time returning to Nacho Daddy!",

    "text": "I hate to give a negative review, because the staff was super-friendly and accommodating. However, when you go out to eat, the goal is, you know, to EAT. And when you go to a place called NACHO Daddy, you kinda expect the nachos to be great. Unfortunately, their nachos were average at best.  As any nacho aficionado will tell you, great nachos start with great chips. Nacho Daddy advertises home made chips, but they sure didn't taste home made, or if they were home made, they need a new recipe. The chips were dry, flavorless, lacking in salt, overly thick, just meh chips. The next aspect of great nachos is that after assembling all the ingredients, the whole thing needs to be baked in a HOT oven, preferably on a cast iron platter, so the cheese melts everywhere, causing the chips to become burned around the edges and stick together in a gooey mess. When it first arrives on your table, it should be too hot to touch and you should have to use a fork to pull a chunk of nachos off the hot platter onto your plate, causing hot steam to be released.  Unfortunately, Nacho Daddy doesn't seem to get any of this. It looked like they piled some chips on a serving plate, then covered the chips with some type of crappy yellow cheese, I guess Cheeze Whiz, then added the other ingredients on top, skipping the step where you're supposed to bake the whole thing in the oven to melt it all together. It wasn't served particularly hot, the cheese wasn't really melted, nor was it good-quality cheese. Great nachos use cheddar, not some yellow fake cheese squeezed out of a bottle. The rest of the ingredients were just OK. The ground beef was acceptable, but the guac was nothing special, tasted like it came out of a jar. The portion size was fairly large, enough for two people, but really for $18.50, considering the low-quality ingredients and the mediocre preparation, it was kind of a ripoff.  There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Vegas, so there's no reason to go to Nacho Daddy for half-baked nachos, pun intended. I do want to end this overall negative review on a positive note by reiterating that the staff was amazing. Both the girl who seated us and the gentleman who waited on us were extremely friendly and polite. I wish I could have been more enthusiastic about the food.",

The portion size is shareable. Even we couldnt finish the 3 items we shared.  I will say eat fast cause once it's cold nachos not that great. I didnt realize if I check in I couldve gotten a free margarita . But all in all 2 thumbs up.",

I would have helped but I just couldn't so doggie bags and food for later. I got their signature margarita a little pricey but really good. If there was anything negative to say it would be the music. Maybe because we were right over a speaker but we had to talk loudly to communicate.  Other than that awesome food and the establishment looks awesome. Over all, great experience and food!",

I couldn't stop eating them haha we also got the 4 cheese nachos which were simple and yummy.

    "text": "While I had to say that our service was pretty outstanding, I was really underwhelmed by my meal here, which is a bummer.   Tip- check in on Yelp to get a free house margarita. It's smaller than the one you'd get it you'd order it on your own, but c'mon, it's free.  We were sat at a table by the bar and our waiter began his magic. Taking drink orders. Convincing my friend to do that $20 scorpion shot, which she said she enjoyed. None for me, please and thank you. I got my free margarita and an Iced tea- the marg was amazing, the iced tea was not.  I ordered the triple dipper for the table. The guacamole was a little tough to dip into. The queso I thought was out of this world, and the salsa was alright. Spicy for being a ild salsa and we were able to get free refills of the chips because I think I ate an entire basket of myself.  Note- my advice after eating here is to get the nachos. Whatever kind. I'd see them pass by me and I'd think, \"dammit, I should have ordered that!\" Every freaking time. There wasn't one that looked bad, so that was my error.  I actually got their seafood enchilada combo. The refried beans to me were too runny. The rice was dry and the enchiladas had no real flavor to them. I took a few bites and smooshed everything around to make it seem like I ate more than I did. I didn't want to be one of those, \"please return this and order me something else, please\" people. So I ate what I could before my stomach revolted agains me and called it again.  I'd give this place another chance, but I know now what to order and what to stay clear of. With name like, \"nacho daddy\" there shouldn't be anything else on the menu BUT nachos. Live and learn, Andy. Live and learn.  But if nothing else, I learned that I love their margaritas. Especially the strawberry flavored ones.",

    "text": "Despite being a Vegas local, tonight was my first time here. I'll be honest, I wasn't too impressed. I travel a lot for business so I'm always experiencing restaurants and tonight they just missed the mark for me. I ordered the fajita bowl and paid an extra $4 to upgrade from chicken to steak. Unfortunately, there were only a couple pieces of filet, which I found to be unfair as there is an extra charge and also just unfair in general, disappointed there. When I went to take a bite, I got a big bite of warm food and a part that was ice cold, had to send my food back. Initially when I got my food, it came with a side of rice, which I mixed into my bowl. When the new bowl came back out, no side of rice but they put the rice in themselves and it was a very small amount.  Beans have a cinnamon/sweet undertone that I wasn't a huge fan of.  Maybe tonight was an off night...  Bartenders were kind, offered me a free drink but I'm not looking for handouts, just a great food and atmosphere experience, but I did appreciate the offer for sure.   I didn't eat more than a few bites of my new bowl, took it to go because I just wasn't a fan, my boyfriend said he would eat it as we don't like food to go to waste.  Then to end my experience, they charged me double for the bowl.   I don't think I'll be back :/",

    "text": "This place is just ok.  Pretty typical food, really nothing special.  It's located off the normal path but not far from Fremont Street Experience.  I had the Thai Chicken Nachos (sorry no picture) and they were very bland, I would have thought there would have been more \"kabow\" to them.  Hubby had the cheese enchiladas and they were average.  Service was meh, it wasn't busy.  There were four employees just standing over on one side of the restaurant playing on their cell phones while Hubby and I were ignored on more than one occasion. Expect to be charged for every little thing.  Nachos didn't come with salsa, I was charged $2 they didn't come with jalapenos so I asked for pickled and was charged $1.50.  Hubby was charged $1.50 for a side of two corn tortillas.  I know the profit margin on Mexican food, there is no need for all of the minuscule charges.  We won't be back, plenty of other good places on or near Freemont with good food.  Keep Yelpin Y'all!",

The drinks were good as was the queso dip. The food came out in a decent amount of time.  BUT  The nachos were horrible. The meat on them was not even seasoned. That was disappointing, bad nachos at a place called Nacho Daddy? The shrimp taco could have been great if the shrimp wasn't undercooked or so greasy. You couldn't even pick it up without it falling everywhere.",

First, the worst margaritas in Vegas. They are so incredibly sweet, it's actually undrinkable. I can't believe they claim they are voted the best in town and I am shocked they haven't changed the recipe after the feedback I've heard from other people that have had them.   Secondly, it seems they always have the giant front roll up door open even on extremely hot days. If your going there between may and August, be ready to sweat! Not the best environment for enjoying a nice lunch or dinner.   If you stick with the ice cold beer they offer and go either at night, or in the fall/winter, you will have a 5 star experience!",

Total love and care go into each special glass, in addition to decent mixed-drink tequila and house-made mixers. And they are super delicious! Totally worth the price you pay.

Others had cheeseburger Nachos plus everyone had many different kinds, all of which were delicious.  Use your Yelp ap and you get a free Margurita with the order of Nachos.   I, a local would, would bring guests there anytime we are downtown.  It's a full meal. Prices are not bad.",

It's really good and they sure do not skimp in the meat. There seemed to be more meat than nachos though. Because the meat is in the saltier side, the fish can use more chips to balance the flavors.  Worth trying. It's a bit off of the main street... nice place to go with friends to share nachos and enjoy alcohol. Our server was really friendly to us even though we only ordered one item and one alcohol.",

Just a few steps away from the hustle and bustle of Fremont, this place is worth going off the beaten path (but really, it's very close to the action!!!).   Upon entering we sat ourselves and were promptly given menus and served waters. We ordered a small white queso which is served atop a small candle to keep the cheesiness smooth. Brilliant!   Their menu is extensive, but why order anything but nachos? We went for the potato nachos and the filet mignon nachos. The potato nachos are served on actual potato chips- I was expecting potato chunks on chips but oh well...what I got was okay. The filet mignon nacho plate was insane. It was way too much for one person, so order wisely! The steak was delicious as were all the other trimmings.   Service during the meal was great. We never felt neglected and our water glasses were kept full the entire meal.   I would definitely come back here to try more menu items as well as drinks, and will recommend it to friends heading downtown.",

Our waiter was excellent, he gave totally great service and was fun to talk with.  We ordered margaritas, because why wouldn't we? They were just average, nothing to write home about.  We decided to split one of there nacho plates.  I am not saying they weren't good, but when your name is Nacho Daddy I expect them to fulfill the name.  Ours had very little stuff on top and something seemed not right with the cheese.  Any how, it was cheap and I believe more of a 20's crowd would absolutely love it.",

On the very busy night we went the waitress finagled us a table! This was highly appreciated.  3. Waitress(es) took chips and salsa off of our bill due to the business and semi-slow service, again much appreciated  4. The only thing that irked me was the lack of space!

They even turned the sound of the game on for us. So having a decent time. But then, she came in like a wrecking ball. An off duty nacho daddy bartender with fire red hair that was a 1 person megaphone! Annoying, loud, obnoxious. Almost put her finger in my beer and musta thought we were all there for her cause she was at the top of her lungs the whole damn time. We moved to the other side of the bar and what do ya know-she followed us. We could not escape. She was gonna blow our eardrums out and with only 2 min left in the game we had to sit there and take it. Then, to our rescue, one of the bartenders seeing our despair called firey red to the other side of the bar. But she only made it halfway before she found someone else to scream at. We woulda enjoyed it much more as the staff girls were nice and lots of tv's. But lil red ryder blew our time to hell. Since she works there we prob wont go back as i assume thats her watering hole to. Wont discourage anyone from going, but when you get to the corner of 4th & fremont, and you here a loud obnoxious sound coming from nacho daddys, keep walking cause someones getting their firetruck on and wailing away",

I still left a tip just to be courteous but on my way home was regretting it! Will definitely NEVER be back!!! If I could leave a smaller rating I would!

There was a small room with about 4 parties of people eating so I was told there would be a 20 minute wait (even though there was a whole section behind the bar that was completely empty). My name was supposedly put on a list. So my family and I walked around the corner to see downtown Vegas for 15 minutes and came back. My name was never put on any list, but they said they would seat us shortly (even though now the whole place was empty). While we were waiting to be seated, I asked if they had any change for the meters outside the restaurant and was told no. Insert side eye here....you are working in a restaurant on a street with meter parking and you don't have a single quarter in this whole place for patrons. Needless to say we just walked out. RUDE. We went to another Nacho Daddy outside of the city and it was fabulous. My advice: DON'T BOTHER GOING TO THIS LOCATION.",

Very clean and our server Eva was awesome. Very personable and knew the menu well. We all got nachos myself the ones with the pulled BBQ pork and white cheddar and cilantro. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. I definitely recommend them. My husband got the hamburger nachos and those were very yummy. One of our friends got the tacos and man oh man was the tortilla delish. House made by the chef himself and the best thing we had ever tried. We tried asking for the recipe but they wouldn't share their secret recipe. Although Eva told us they were in the process of creating a cook book and to look for it in May! Man I can't wait til May so I can be one of the firsts in line to purchase all the yummy dishes. Thank you Nacho Daddy and Eva we had a wonderful time.",

I love sweet bbq sauce. This is basically a review of their bbq sauce. Sorry about that. Also, their portions are pretty big so that's a definite plus.  The restaurant itself was nice. There were a lot of tables and tvs showing sports so anyone who likes that should definitely go. I don't particularly care but there was a crowd there watching something last night so other sports fans must like coming there. The prices were pretty good. I didn't see much over $12 except for like shrimp and seafood related dishes. All in all, a good deal.",

I love em the way they are. Kudos to them all if they are not trying to be anything more than a nacho stop meets watering hole. That's right on.   And hey! There's vegetarian and vegan nachos (I like this). There's also margaritas and scorpion shots (I like this a lot) and more alcohol so you can have a lot of fun here. Go with an obnoxious group. It's not hipster!   I'd definitely take a brood of children here, they'd demolish the plates. Me not so much. I stopped in the middle, at the cold part. But I do eat slow and I love downtown and nachos and I stumble in here enough to really enjoy and anticipate any inconsistency. It's sooo good drunk.   Sad to see so many bad service reviews since our guy was super great. He kept the jalapenos coming. And they were chill about the add ons...been accommodating so far.",

It had peppers, onions, and jalapenos and was served over a candle to keep it warm. I then poured for the fried avocado tacos. They were delicious, but I wish they were bigger or came with rice and /or beans. My only complaint is that the the server messed up our check (I needed it split for work reimbursement but wanted both checks on the same card... He then recombined the checks instead of just running them separately). I would still go again because it was pretty darn good!",

Our food didn't come together, 1 person in our party of 6 didn't even get their plate at all.  She said she was going to take it off the bill, then proceeded to have her co worker come over and have us pay for it.  It was a cluster fuck.  No one apologized or owned up to anything.  I forgot to mention, the rest of the service our original waitress was hiding out from us, bizarre!!!     But let me tell you, the food is well worth to come back to.  Every time we'll be in downtown Vegas, we will definitely be here to dine!  Hands down, my brothers Loco Moco nachos were the best!  And don't forget to try the Mexican corn as an appetizer.  Prices were good for the quality of food you get!  A must try",

I ordered my same drink Coke soda, but instead get the spicy grilled wings we got the triple dip it comes with queso, salsa & gaucamole. The slasa was hot tasting but it really wasn't all that hot. The quseo was runny cheese but flavorful but I dont like the gaucamole so my bf and friends ate it.  Our waitress was nice got our drinks and friendly with us. I wanted to get different nachos this time. So I got the chicken enchilada nachos. I love enchiladas so I wanted to try as nachos again it comes avocado I don't like avocados so I got extra sour cream. My bf got supreme tostada nachos. I really like my chicken enchilada nachos the refried beans, cheese, red sauce and jalapenos really great. My boyfriend like his supreme toastda nachos.   Another great time being here at Nacho Daddy. Nice place to chill, drink, & eat nachos. Will recommend this place to people who will be in Vegas near Fremont Street.",

Would I order again? Probably not delivery, I'll be fair and go to the restaurant next time before I make my final decision. But as of right now it gets 3 stars.",

You can get chicken or shrimp or steak too.   They specialize in the nachos duh- and I did see plenty a plate towering with dem nachos. However idk if I want a plate of cholesterol with a side of high blood pressure and diabetes. They surely looked good and definitely smelled good.   The staff is very personable and service was quick. Not bad for a full restaurant and a Sat night.   There's also several margaritas and tequilas to choose from. I eyed out getting either a guava margarita or a blood orange or the Thai basil one. But I copped out and got a Moscow mule as I was craving some ginger beer. It was good as well.   So yes I would def recommend this place and yes I def can see me coming back. Nacho Daddy be my daddy.",

Packed with flavor but the chips were a bit pale...cound use another minute or two in the fryer but they stay crispy.....tried the salad with chicken, it came inside a flour tortilla bowl that was also undercooked a bit....very pale and tasted strange....different than all the flour tortillas i've tasted before...but the salad was fresh, dressing was fantastic and chicken was flavorful. Also tried their beer flight....honestly the beers were terrible....skip the beer lol. Price wasn't too friendly...some stuff are way overpriced, some are ok.Our server was attentive, the host doesn't look like she gives a sh*t about her job, she was busy ignoring people and eating on her host station. Overall will come back for more nachos when i'm back in vegas....",

Pitchers of water at the ready and always quick to check on us and answer any questions.  Queso dip was delicious, we cleaned the bowls. The flaming shrimp fajitas (while not flamed table side) were really good. Our group also really enjoyed the huevos rancheros. It was honestly one of the better Mexican meals I've had in a long time. Reasonably priced and delicious, they knocked it out of the park for sure. I would definitely return.",

If your hungry on Fremont Nacho Daddy is definitely a convenient spot. Flip a coin and create your own experience.  Con: Restroom absolutely disgusting!",

The shredded chicken BBQ nachos were a hit. So we also ordered the shredded chicken street tacos I really enjoyed those as well.      Sometimes when you order shredded chicken from Mexican restaurants it's a little to mushy but this was cooked perfectly.     Dh ordered the filet street tacos and finished the whole plate.      This little gem had a yelp check in for a free margarita but didn't use it. I prefer strawberry and it was for a regular margarita.  We happen to be here during happy hour so margaritas were 5 bucks.      Big thumbs up and I would definitely return.",

We had scheduled this event for 30 people, we pre-ordered appetizers, & we had a full confirmation email from Mark. Upon arrival the hostess explained she knew nothing of our reservation-it wasn't in the books. We requested to speak to the manager, the assistant general manager came out. He explained, without being apologetic, that Mark (who is also the owner) is responsible for catering and he doesn't work directly in that particular location. Basically the excuse was lack of communication between staff. We showed the assistant general manager the confirmation email and he shrugged his shoulders and said there was nothing he could really do other than ask our group of 30 to wait an hour plus to be sat.  THIS WAS FOR MY WEDDING.",

We decided to split the supreme tostada nachos and cali burrito. The supreme nachos were great, they had a lot going on! I'm glad a side of chips came with the cali burrito because there weren't enough nachos to scoop up all the good stuff. The burrito exceeded my expectations. I love a good burrito. My hesitation with cali burritos is the soggy fries that usually go in it, but this cali burrito had the perfect crispiest garlic parmesan fries in it. My only complaint is that my half was too small and I wanted more! The service wasn't great. It wasn't busy and we were trying to flag down a server for beer for a while. Once we finally got his attention, it took a while for the beers to come. We didn't get our drinks until we were almost done with the food. Still 5 stars from me though because the food was bomb.",

I was new in town and on a cleanse/diet looking for tasty vegan meals. Their Vegan Flaming Chick'n Fajitas and Vegan Chocolate Cake were so delicious that for a while I ordered them multiple more times via Uber Eats. One day I just had to go in person and see what this place was all about! I ended up trying and loving more on their menu. I love their drink selection too. Amongst my absolute favorites on the menu thus far are the Thai Chicken Nachos, Flaming Fajitas, Vegan Flaming Chick'n Fajitas, Vegan Crispy Avocado Street Taco, Vegan Chocolate Cake, House Margarita and the Mexican Candy Margarita! These are all mouth watering options!  I love sitting at their bar, as Ariel is a fantastic bartender. They have an eclectic concept, appeal and style. Seating is available indoor and outdoor. There is a large front window which is usually opened with stools so sitting inside with an outside connection is possible. Food service is superb, it's brought in a friendly and timely manner. The staff is attentive and courteous. I just love the vibe here! I've become a regular at a restaurant for the first time! I honestly do recommend them to any one - any day, even the whole family!

    "text": "After strolling around Fremont on a rainy day, we were ready to dry off and get a bite to eat. At the suggestion of our friend and local Las Vegas guide, we headed over to Nacho Daddy. I honestly think that had she not suggested it, I never would have noticed it. Not only is it off a side street near Fremont but it's also not flashy like many Vegas restaurants and we almost walked by it.  The inside is simple but what the restaurant lacks in decor, it seems to make up in quality of food. Everyone was pleased with their dishes, from quesadillas to burritos to nachos.  While I was tempted to order the nachos, I knew that I could never finish a plate of nachos on my own. It's too bad that they don't offer half orders of the nachos. Instead, I chose the chicken quesadilla. It was one of the best quesadillas that I've ever had. It was filled with gooey cheese and juicy shredded chicken and served with a side of sour cream, guacamole and pice de gallo. Had I not been on vacation, I would have been content to eat half and take the rest to go but instead I forced myself to finish the quesadilla and was pleasantly stuffed for quite awhile.   Two of my friends shared the Fiesta Nacho and managed to clear the plate between the two of them. These nacho plates are definitely something to share with a friend though, unless you're a super heavy eater. Another friend ordered the vegan burrito and I was impressed that a Mexican restaurant offered several vegan options.   Compared to places on the Strip, prices at Nacho Daddy are very reasonable. My quesadilla cost about $12 with tax and tip, which isn't much different than what I pay in San Diego. The nacho plates ranged from $7.50 for cheese nachos to $16ish for nachos with meat and lots of toppings.",

Even the managers who knew a few members of the group complained we were \"too quiet\", and encouraged us with a nice round of tequila!  I think it did the trick, conversations were turning up in volume and all of us with smiles.  The food order was placed and did not take long to arrive. All orders came out at the same time.  The food is Mexican food remixed. Everything is fresh, the flavors are inventive and delicious and the menu features something for every taste.

Fam: That doesn't change the fact that we're hungry.  Me: Well, I found this place nearby that's dedicated to nachos. Y'all want some nachos?  Fam:  :-0   Uh, fuck YEAH!  Boom. Nachos for Christmas dinner. Not just any nachos, but damn good nachos. Nachos supreme, cheeseburger nachos, thai nachos, and vegan \"chicken\" nachos? Double-fuck-yeah!    This spot is owned by a few former Zappos employees, and while it borders on cheesy (in the figurative sense), the (literal) cheesy goodness overcomes all of that business. The nachos here are seriously tasty. Each portion is sized for one very hungry man or two moderately hungry people not my size. Eminently shareable, these platters are a crowd pleaser. Easy to order a few different styles and throw down on a table full of goodness.   They have numerous non-nacho options, like burritos and enchiladas and such, but why bother? Come here for the nachos. Or the surprisingly robust vegan menu. Usually vegan items are an after-thought, but any vegan would be very happy with the selection here.   They have a check in offer for a free house marg with purchase of an entree, which is cool, but the main specialty marg is where it's at. They also have corny \"scorpion shots\" and merch so you can boast about eating a scorpion. But we didn't go there.   5-star nachos, excellent service, fun atmosphere... if the whole thing weren't so cheese-ball this place would get a full 5-stars from me. I mean, it's a half-block off the Fremont Experience so they're obviously playing to that crowd. So good on them for that.",

They have plenty of healthy options, which can easily be evened out with their delicious queso. (I can never say \"no\" to queso!) Anyway, the tacos are HUGE and come on homemade thick tortillas that are to die for. We ordered 2 and couldn't finish them. My entree was the kale salad and it was also delicious! Lots of different flavors mingle to create a healthy and fresh lunch.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get your free house marg. It was pretty good!",

The front area had a few party animals in the outdoor seating area/line - which is expected in Downtown - and this surprisingly didn't deter me from taking my toddler into eat. The food pics online lived up to my expectations! We had a single order of the fajitas with lettuce boats and it was delicious! Definitely recommend the chicken fajitas. We ordered the Trio as an appetizer so the single order of fajitas was enough for two people. My father raved all night about how tasty the dish was, and that he didn't eat it with tortillas (he is borderline diabetic and steers clear of extra carbs). There is a big vegan menu to choose from. The Daddy's Mule was as expected, the pinot grigio was nice and crisp and cold, and the other folks in my group loved their enchiladas and burrito. Every dish was larger than we anticipated. Will return again.",

Bartender was friendly and got us menus right away. We ordered 1 house margarita (free when you order an entree and check in with yelp) and a dos XX lager. Margarita was delicious and the beer perfectly cold. It's been awhile since I've had beer that cold from a draft selection. We weren't in a real hurry to eat so we finished our 1st round. We were ready for 2nd but the bartender (Anya) kept walking by and not offering us another round. Personally I believe it's the bartenders job to look up smile and check to see who needs more drinks. I had to yell out to get her attention to finally get a refill. We ended up ordering the chicken tinga nachos which were brought out in a timely manner and were delicious. We stayed for a few more rounds. Anya (bartender) seemed to get back into the groove and was much better towards the end.",

So we killed time at the arcade while sucking back our frozen Mia Tias, hello brain freeze! Meanwhile the damn place closed! What the fuck, right? Well, no! Me being the women I am, I'm now buzzed, hungry, irritated, and well, every other emotion women feel the need to have all at once. So we head back down the street when this well lit sign was pretty much calling my name!   Hello, Nacho Daddy's! Instantly the music caught my attention. (I love when I know every song and I can sing to it) the staff was so welcoming. The bathrooms were super clean. The menus looked delicious!!!!   DUDE THE FUCKEN FOOD WAS AMAZING! Like lick your plate amazing! We tried several different nachos and drinks. Hands down one of the BEST places to eat in Vegas! #foodporn #noregerts",

As we walk up to the door I hear music, people talking and laughing I immediately perk up thinking this place is going to be fun and amazing.... we walk past the hostess stand which is outside of the door, we look around I see a few bartenders, servers  and Busboys yet not one bothered to say Hi or  acknowledge us. I finally walk up to the bar and asked if I could sit anywhere? She looked shocked that the hostess wasn't out side and the then was nice enough to give us menus and found a good table for us. The waiter was nice informed us of the drink specials. I decided to get a Daddy's Michelada and OMG it was like unicorns and rainbows Amazing!!! And it's the main reason they are getting 3 stars... for the appraiser we ordered Queso Dip although the presentation was good the actual Queso was very bland no flavor at all and overall disappointing. Finally for my Entree I ordered the Smothered Burrito with chicken and the green sauce it was okay. It was a little bland. The only thing that saved my Burrito was the sauce it was drenched in. The chicken on it's own was dry. Now I didn't go in thinking it was going to be authentic Mexican food but I did expect for the food to have some flavor and it didn't. I also did have the Guacamole and Pico with chips and that was really good. I might come back to give it another chance but it definitely won't be any time soon. Unless I'm in the mood for a Daddy's Michelada.",

I asked the server what the specialty was and she said the burger nacho so that is what I ordered.  The portion was very large and the chips were great and the cheese sauce was pretty good too.  The burger part was a chilly type sauce that you would find on hot dogs.  It wasn't bad but could have used a lot more flavor and some spice.  To kick it up I had to use a lot of hot sauce.  There were also no jalapeno peppers.   My wife had the vegan tofu nachos and loved them but this is my review on what I had.  The bottom line for me is if you are a nacho place and some gets your signature dish it should be oh wow.  What I had was ok not oh wow.  Average ok place.",

The place is small and cramped, and I think they could have alleviated that problem by making the bar just a bit smaller and instituting some smaller bar seats, as the seats take up to much room in the walk-ways.   Happy hour consists of $5 margaritas and $4.50 Mexican beers they have on draft. Not the largest selection for a HH, but not bad. There is food on the HH menu as well. I ordered the shrimp tacos and out they came as fried shrimp tacos, which I would have liked to have known and wish the menu would have pointed that out.  My friend and I also shared a nacho platter, ahem, since we were at a place called NACHO Daddy I had great expectations. They arrived in no time and were placed on our table. As I looked at this platter of nachos I questioned many things in life, \"When a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?\"... \"When I am at a place that specifically has Nachos in its' name and I am unimpressed with the nachos... are they really nachos at all?\"  We got the Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos. I have reservations on whether or not the meat was actually filet mignon. I also have reservations now on ever ordering a $16.95 priced plate of nachos, which I expected to be bigger, and better.  Next time I want nachos I will go to Roberto's and ask for Carne Asada Nachos and I'll eat the &*&! out of those things and be happy I didn't pay $17 for them.",

However, the second time I came was not so fantastic. Miss pouty face server told us 3 times in a 20 minute period that they were \"still brewing coffee\". It takes 5 not 20. We were not checked up on until Lauren took over our table 50 minutes into our experience and we JUST got a second cup of coffee. Thank you Lauren for making it happen.  I don't attribute a negative Yelp review to one servers poor customer service though. The food is delicious, the environment is great, 70 different types of tequila is rad, and the owner was kind. I love the restaurant concept.",

The food is ok, the margaritas by the glass are good (quality for pitcher margaritas strangely varies), but the service was really only worth it for happy hour. Most disappointing is that the website still advertises happy hour while they don't honor it! We'll go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Nachso good service Angie.  Last night we returned to see if our service would be better than my previous trip as outlined below. We brought a friend from BC for some food and drinks. Upon arrival there was a table on the patio with customers so we chose the opposite side after waiting a short time my wife went in and asked the Bartender if we could get service. Answer was yes. 23 minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered 2 shots of Julio 42 and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order. Really piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx Earle We stopped in to check ND's out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising $5 tacos and $6 Titos  We sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had $6 Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos  Later that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered 3 Titos and service was really slow \"different bartender\"  took forever to pay.  Got the bill and the bartender charged us $9 a drink instead of the posted $6 price. After some discussion they finally adjusted the bill. Then sent a guy out front to take down the posted special sign.  Not sure if or when we will return",

So many kinds of nachos but my husband wanted to stay away from anything too spicy so we hot the Nacho Average Burger nachos and they were great! The meat was well seasoned, the queso was good, and then of course there was also bacon. I got the spicy blood orange margarita and it was just too spicy for me, I was dying, but I couldn't stop drinking it, because it was delicious! My husband's house margarita was also excellent.",

    "text": "A clutch place for the gluten free crowd, their menu is loaded with clearly marked gluten free choices.  With specialties of nachos and margaritas, you really can't go wrong stopping in for a lunch and beverage while visiting Fremont Street.  Their menu contains several other options including breakfast.  If I'm going to stop at a restaurant labeled Nacho Daddy, it's a certainty there are going to be some nachos in transit through my digestive system.  I stopped in once myself and another time with my wife, giving me ample opportunities to sample their nachos.  The filet mignon nachos are fantastic, and I highly recommend having them.  Their four cheese and \"cheeseburger\" nachos are also amazing.  Keep in mind that their servings are large, so one order might be adequate - depending on your appetite.  Their margaritas are a great combination with their food and can be purchased as a single drink or in a pitcher.  When I visited, there was a free classic margarita with the purchase of an entree for checking in on Yelp!, so have your app handy.  The service was good during my visits, especially from Allie who was very sensitive about the food allergies that my wife and I bring to every dining excursion.  If you need something that hits the spot, be sure to stop in at Nacho Daddy. You're guaranteed a full stomach and a great accompanying cocktail.",

Food was great for everybody, fajita bowl was amazing and tasty, the taco shell was crisp and just yummy. A few mistakes but were fixed instantly, so no issues with that. Drinks and Food were great again so no issues...   Kayla is always amazing great help with choosing food and drinks. Great personality and remembers the customers.   Dean was our server tonight and he was great also. Simple and easy helpful with choosing drinks.",

You might be intimidated by their options and combos, but don't worry, because anything you pick is going to hit the spot  I would definitely recommend the Golden Knights Nachos, and they're big enough to share! If you want something lighter, I'd recommend the fajitas for something filling and delicious. I always get a cold beer to compliment the savory flavor of the nachos, so don't be afraid to splurge! If you check in here on Yelp, you can get a free margarita with an entree!!  Anyone who is walking the downtown area should come and check this place out, you won't regret it, and you won't forget it  5 / 5 Stars.

For a chain restaurant, their prices are designed to gouge the nearby tourists. $16 for one Coke and one poorly crafted margarita. This is what you'd expect to pay at a nightclub, but not a crappy chain restaurant. We all ordered drinks upon arriving and a couple of us had to flag down servers for a missing soda and margaritas. We watched the bartender keep dropping his drink recipe notes. The nachos were disgusting. It tasted like stale chips with what looked like dog food on top...I wouldn't feed this to my dog. The servers had no idea who ordered what and settling the bill was a monumental task for them. Make sure you count your change before you leave. A very disappointing experience.  I wouldn't waste my time or money since there are plenty of other better places to go nearby.",

I had the Thai chicken plate and our server, Dezi, happily substituted vegan chicken for the meat-eater variety,added back beans, and subtracted the jalapenos.  My goodness - so good.  And the staff is so friendly. We met the manager and the head cook. We really hope this Vegas local restaurant (actually 3 in this area now) will come to Plano/Frisco, and Georgetown/Round Rock areas in Texas. Nothing quite like this gourmet Mexican restaurant with a whole Vegan section in Texas. Try it all you vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters.  It's delish.",

She handled the situation better than we could ask for by telling us don't worry she'll take care of it but I told her that I put a $20 bill and the credit card in the folder and that she needs to look at the security camera above us because that employee is scamming us and she said he worked for her for 5 years and he would never do that and I insisted that she check the cameras and she refused.

Despite my fears, they were very accommodating. They had high chairs and kids menus out for us in no time at all. They have kid cups which seems minor but I can't tell you how many times down waiter had attempted to hand a big, open top, glass to our toddlers.   The food was amazing, the kids loved  the chicken fingers and BBQ nachos. My husband and I devoured the dip sampler, he has tacos and I had the Mexican burger. It was excellent.

    "text": "We were highly disappointed in this establishment, especially after pointing at it all week and thinking that it might be a cool spot to have dinner.  Sigh, more fools us.  We came in on St. Patrick's night and the place was quieter than every other restaurant on the Fremont Street Experience, which should have been our first warning.  We ordered a pitcher of White Peach margaritas and the \"average burger\" nachos for me, Daddy's Supreme chicken taco for him.  Then we waited patiently, expecting the drinks to come out first.  No such luck - here comes the food.  I look over at my husband's plate and see this really sad-looking taco shell with a bunch of filling in it.  There was more plate than food, and I had a nasty feeling that the rest of the experience wasn't going to be much better than this.  My nachos, at least, had some substance.  But... they were just okay, not great.  The cheese sauce tasted like reheated Cheez Whiz, there was no bacon whatsoever to be found, and the onions were minced so finely that they just disintegrated the moment they touched my tongue.  I was bitterly disappointed.    To make matters worse, the margaritas came when we were nearly done with our food.  Bad, bad timing.  We were pretty much ready to pack up and leave by that point.  Once the drinks came, the experience was slightly better - but, hey, I got drunk.  If it takes getting me drunk to improve things... (and my husband will tell you that he has never seen me tie one on like that, ever)  Final insult:  the bill was 53 dollars, making it the most expensive meal we had in Vegas over the course of a week.  It wasn't close to being worth that.  My husband honestly didn't want to leave a tip at all, but I convinced him otherwise.    It never did get any busier while we were there.  I see why it didn't now.  The only reason why 2 stars - the food was edible and the drinks packed a punch.  But that's it. Servers were polite but in the end did nothing to improve our experience here.  Not recommended.",

Sorry, overpriced for what you get.",

    "text": "This is located just a block away from Freemont street, but seems a bit quieter -- at least on a Sunday afternoon. However, the service leaves much to be desired...We sat at the bar and had chips, salsa, guac and margaritas. It took FOREVER for EVERYTHING! It took a while for us to even get menus, then for the bar tender to take our order, and then the bartender forgot our drinks order, so we had to ask someone else, and then the bartender didn't put in our whole order (even though we only ordered 2 things), so they we had to wait for them to bring out the salsa... The salsa was mediocre and the guac was underwhelmingly plain. The chips were actually pretty good. The margaritas were also mediocre.  And then we had to go through this cycle again of trying to find someone to give us the check. We were going to pay with credit card, but it took so long that we ended up just paying with cash and leaving.  Ambiance-wise, this seemed like a pretty mediocre Tex-Mex/Americanized Mexican joint. Also, they had some interesting choices for their TVs surrounding the bars. One had infomercials, just infomercials: vitamin supplements, prostate issues. Another TV had cartoons. If you're going to make your customers wait indefinitely, at least put something interesting on TV to keep them entertained.",

    "text": "A friend was celebrating her birthday and chose this new Nacho Daddy location for dinner. I was so excited because I had been to the location in Henderson and always had good food andxservice.  I was a little disappointed as the downtown location is much smaller and the decor is super urban. There is a small seating area of 2-4 person tables (about 10) and a wall that seperates the bar area with counter height seating. It fits the downtown scene but I don't find that seperation comfortable.   The menu is not the same as what's online or what is at the Henderson location. This menu has less items which was disappointing because I was raving to all of my friends about their delicious quesadillas and it wasn't there. We were also told by the staff that there were items available at the bar were not available on the menu. In the end we got our quesadillas but it was confusing.   Our party was about 13 people and the servers were very good at getting our food and drinks without too long of a wait. I had the burger nachos which was delicious and a raspberry margarita which was a little too sweet but good. My boyfriend had steak fajitas and a skinny margarita and was very satisfied. We ordered the smore's nachos for dessert and that was epic! I recommend it to anyone who loves marshmallows and chocolate.   It was a really good meal and I would go again now that I know what to expect.",

We went for an early dinner, so it wasn't crowded, but it did start to fill up by the time we left, mostly around the bar.  I had trio ground beef enchilada plate with rice and beans. The meat was good, no gristle and very flavorful without being greasy. There happened to be a photo of this in the menu, and for once it was an exact representation of what I got!  Overall it was a very tasty meal.    The menu is large and varied for a Mexican place, and if you like Tequila you should come take a look at their liquor menu.  I would definitely go back.",

The environment was nice, different from the Henderson location but that's expected because this is more of a bar theme.  The service was ok. They were really friendly but it took a long time for us to get our food. 45 minutes to an hour which is quite long.   I got chicken enchiladas which I typically get at the Henderson location but they were not good. The tortilla was too thick, the chicken wasn't even shredded, more of chunks and the flavor tasted like it came from a can. The rice was hard and nothing to be desired.   Chips were good but you can't really mess that up. Waiting for our check took a while too. Clearly we were ready to go and our waiter walked passed us multiple times without a check in his hand. Finally after bringing it by it took another 10 minutes for him to come get it and the card to pay, despite 1/3 of our party standing up.  Many groups came, ate and left while we were still waiting for our food. We had 3 people in our group so our order was not large.   I won't be back to this location and probably will skip on the other location too.",

The portions are massive and the food is indulgent. This was great for my friends, but not me initially because I wanted something healthier to eat. I ordered an egg white omelet with avocado and hash browns, which turned out to be enormous! It was delicious, but a little greasy from the grilled veggies that were inside it. I ate half of it and was stuffed. They were kind enough to bring out free dessert for my friend's birthday! The Fried Ice Cream was SO GOOD! It was my first time having fried ice cream and I really enjoyed it. The real star was the cinnamon covered corn flakes that came with it. I would recommend ordering their nachos since they look amazing and you won't find anything relatively healthy here. Great place if you're looking for food late at night.",

I ordered a Jalapeno Cucumber margarita, when you check-in with Yelp and order an entree you get 1 free margarita. The coupon is good for $8.95, but I asked the server and he recommended this drink. It was $12.95, but they apply the coupon off so I only paid $4, and it was well worth it. It was not a stingy portion, and it was not watered down tequila. It was so good!   Everything we ordered tasted so good, everyone was friendly, just all around good vibes. We parked in the garage right around the corner for $4, so that was also nice that there was ample parking. We didn't have to wait for a table, and we didn't see any homeless/weirdos hanging around outside.   Downtown Las Vegas is overall very dirty as a whole, but this place didn't feel as a part of that. I think they work their location as best as they possibly can.   We will definitely be coming back!",

I started to notice other people's food coming out that sat down after our group.  I politely asked the bartender/server to check on our food.  One person in our group received her food - chicken nachos.  After another 15 minutes or so passed by, I told her that I wanted to take my food to go.  At this point, it became obvious that she forgot to put our order in all together and she started to become aggressive and rude.    It is not in my nature to be rude to waitstaff.  After more debate the someone from management came out.  I'm told them I would pay for my margarita but didn't want to wait any longer for the food.    I'm frustrated by this point but it's not the end of the world.  Then everything took the worse turn possible.  In an effort to cover her own error for failing to put in our order, she proceeds to tell her manager that I \"verbally assaulted her and cussed her out\".  This was beyond a False accusation as I never even raised my voice.  I did show some frustration which was more than warranted in response to her rude behavior toward us.    Now that I've been labeled an abusive customer I essentially have zero recourse.  The manager isn't getting to the bottom of it.    Now my friend whose nachos were delivered attempts to settle up her bill.  At this point it is discovered that she was provided the order of the couple seated next to us who ordered the exact same thing.  My friend is then accused of knowingly eating the other couples food by the angry, out of line bartender/server.  As if she is supposed to know the order she was given was intended for someone else.    All in all, it was the most ridiculous and disastrous situation I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  I encourage anyone who reads this to read my other reviews as they will see that I am a balanced and fair person.  This is the only one star review I have ever given.  You just don't Falsely accuse your customers of verbal assault.    Lastly, I want to add that I have come to Nacho Daddy once every year for the last five years during the Punk Rock Bowling festival.  It's a tight nit community and I will be sharing this review widely.  Again, I have never been treated this way and I am pretty upset about the whole thing.",

It was packed so we sat at the bar and were immediately welcomed by the bartenders.  We ordered the Daddy's margarita and the cucumber margarita-so good!!!   We had a hard time deciding which nachos we wanted and finally decided on the crab and lobster nachos. They were amazing!!!!   Check I with Yelp and get a free house margarita which was really good too",

When we first walked up, it looked like they may have been closed and that Yelp had the hours wrong, but we tried the door and sure enough, they were open.  Yay!  And we were the only customers there...double yay!    Phara was behind the counter and told us that we could sit wherever we liked.  She then took care of us for our entire visit.  She was great!  I knew before going in that I wanted a breakfast taco, so that's what I ordered and it came with rice, beans, and fresh salsa.  Let me say, this plate was amazing!  The fresh crispy flour tortilla was to die for and the taco was so big that there was no picking it up.  I had to eat it with a fork.  So so good!  My daughter ordered the bacon and cheese enchilada with scrambled eggs.  She loved her meal just as much, even saying that it might be the best enchilada she's ever had.  Overall, this was a great experience.  Service and food were both excellent.  The amount of food served was great for the price.  And they have an extensive menu with several versions of nachos that I hope I'm able to return and try one day.  Definitely check them out!",

Definitely no convenient parking nearby, so you'll have to fend for street parking or pay for a garage. Inside, it's a cool modern feel with a lot of exposed brick.   = F O O D = Lots of Tex-Mex flair going on here; obviously not authentic Mexican cuisine if that's what you're looking for. I had to go for a nacho plate!   + MOCO LOCO NACHO ($12.95): A Loco Moco in nacho form! As advertised, there was hardly a dry nacho on the plate, with enough gravy and cheese to cover every chip. Honestly I don't really crave or think of nachos as an item I frequently want to eat, but they were pretty good for nachos.  = D R I N K S = + HOUSE MARGARITA (free): For a free drink, they made it tasty and strong! A one shot wonder like me doesn't need much to get me going.   + MICHELADA: Whew! This was huge and damn good.   A note: they serve the infamous scorpion tequila shots! They're $20, so I decided to pass, but that would probably be fun for a special occasion or dare.  ==== Food: 4 // Service: 5 // Environment: 4 // Price: 3",

I have tried practically most spots in Vegas and this is the one spot that will never let you down!   FOOD   They have foods for any type of dietary requirements you may have as well. Vegan, Paleo, Gluten Free... you name it, and they're all delicious!  This is where they really shine, where it truly matters.   SERVICE  The service here can get a little annoying at times, for some reason they tend to hire some bartenders/waitresses that have some attitude, and don't really do their job correctly. But the food makes up for it.   COST   It is rather pricey for mexican food I suppose (Around $20 /entree) but you will feel satisfied. Again, when I go here i'm thinking in terms of the food quality, so it is a good value for the money, even if you're paying more than at most places.   AMBIANCE   It gets VERY loud, while I don't like loud places, it doesn't take away from anything to be honest, after all, it's right off Fremont Experience so you can't really expect a quiet place. But I suppose it could be concerning to some people.   Bonus:  They're open late which is another huge plus since after some hours it feels like there arent any good spots open in town.   Guaranteed place for every type of person for sure!",

Why the 4STAR, prices of drinks are up there, considering that we are downtown, there are places down there where you can get drinks (yes, DRINKS plural) for the price of 1 drink.  However you buy it because it is apart of the experience, c'mon you have to buy at least 1 margarita.   This time around we ordered the filet mignon nachos, kale salad and a steak bowl.  It was all good, mixed the nacho w/ the salad, Yes PLEASE.  Nachos -steak tendered, well seasoned and lots of it.  Piled high, oowee gooey cheesey goodness.  Beans, pico de gallo, guac, sour cream and house made chips, even with all the toppings the chips still had crunch to them.   Kale Salad -chopped style, carrot, cucumber, corn, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, red onions and avocado w/ grilled shrimp.  The presentation was beautiful, I didn't think of taking a pic until after I mixed everything. Fresh greens, crispy veggies, sweet, tangy, savory...add chalula for a kick of heat.  I'm telling you, now stack your fork such as: salad, try to get as much of the veggies as you can w/o overloading you fork + shrimp + 1 nacho chip loaded w/ all the fixings. YUM!  Pair it with a Daddy's Margarita and you are set for some good eating.   The location is super accessible, right down the street from White Castle.  Outside/Indoor seating, place was pretty packed the night we went.  Service fast and our server was AWESOME!  Yes, I can see myself going back w/ some friends to hang out.    ..but this is just my opinion, check it out for yourself.  It's the Downtown location, you can't go wrong.  It's the perfect set up for a night of partying, get the conversation going, a shot, a drink, some good eats and then good bar hop on Fremont East.",

If I recall correctly, I think I found this place on one of those eat shows! :-) Alright, so my old school mate friend & I hit this up! She said she had heard of it but, never had a chance to go so she was all in and as excited as me to get our Blaxican girl palate fulfilled. Sweet deets Indeed!!!!  This I would say, is the better location out of the 2(other closer to Las Vegas strip) but, the ratings on this are legit. I can solidify this now as this is steps from the \"new Downtown street-front nicely decorated boardwalk look\"!  Don't forget to use your Yelp Check in for a FREE House Margarita as this is sincerely \"the best house margarita I've ever had in Vegas\"!!!! It was so good I think we had 2more and was buzz.   Customer service was attentive, offered recommendations and all together on point.  Food...omg they damn supreme nacho's was the **it! This will be my spot from now on everytime I'm in Vegas as I've been craving Nacho Daddy Nachos & that yummy wet burrito every since...  I'm actually jealous that, my girl stay in Vegas and went back the very next night w/her dude. :-0 and has daily access to this spot unlike myself. :-( being miles away.  She's went 3 times in just a week, since her 1st visit with me. You already know...she's on my **it-List because, she been more times than me now & WITHOUT ME! This is just not right! Laughing out loud   PSA: @Nacho Daddy please open up a location in Atlanta, GA. Atlantic Station, Downtown ATL, On Edgewood, Cucumber-land Mall area would be a great place to look into. Please please please come to Atlanta.",

    "text": "So our first time at Nacho Daddy was a couple days ago on our first night in Vegas, but I was way too fucked up to really eat. Our friends ended up ordering two nachos, the crab and lobster and filet mignon nachos. Once we got back to our Airbnb I sobered a little more and got to try a little bit of their nachos and OH MY GOD best nachos ever. I'm not really a big fan of nachos, but DAMN their nachos are literally the best nachos I have ever had! Yes, they are on the pricier side for nachos, but they're so worth it!!   Fast forward to tonight. While we were walking around downtown Las Vegas, a few of our friends got hungry and had no idea where to eat. We saw Nacho Daddy and decided to go there to eat since we remembered that the nachos were amazing. There was no wait and our group of 11 got seated immediately. Jose was our server and he was excellent. We got the same thing and ordered two orders of the crab and lobster and two of the filet mignon nachos. Our friends we brought there for the first time also agreed that they weren't too huge of fans of nachos until they tried these. We demolished those nachos and didn't leave a single chip behind. I'm just sad that nachos won't be the same to me after having them from here.",

Julian & Rico took great care of us the entire time we were there (even though there wasn't anyone else inside the restaurant) and brought out our order of wings and tequila shots always in a timely manner! We had an incredible time here, and were happy with our choice to walk in here. The wings were delicious by the way! Thank you again!!!",

I had a method to my madness though: it had to be on happy hour or have a yelp check-in free drink.   And free drink they did. I got the house margarita with my check in offer and the vegan quesadilla. When I ordered I was surprised to hear a fellow next to me say, \"I'll have what she's having.\" To which the bartender said, \"you know she got the vegan quesadilla right?\"   *cue 30 minute conversation about every Netflix health documentary*  We both enjoyed our quesadillas and margaritas. As the drinks flowed, the less processed/fake it tasted. By my second strong margarita, I was convinced.   Would I recommend making your farm-raised cheese loving grandma try the vegan food here? No, it's not that convincing. But to be drunk and able to indulge in vegan Mexican food is one of my highlights of 2017. Fortunately grandma can order off of the regular non-vegan/vegetarian menu.",

They messed up my nachos, and brought me golden knight ones...ok no biggie. They charged us for both nachos even though we only ordered 1! So he took $25 off when in reality 19.95 of it was food we NEVER even ordered! It took 15 minutes while I watched everyone else eat, then I was given shredded beef caliber for what was supposed to be filet mignon.  It also took almost 35 minutes from the time we ordered to even get our food! I ordered a margarita, and took one sip to see a fly literally swimming around! I finally flagged a staff member down after our bar tender dissapeared with my friends $8 in change (later returning with McDonalds) to complain. He was the only one that wasn't horrible. The bald manager with a goatee came back with a horrible attitude yelling at us because we didn't seek him out right away for their screw up! He told us that he couldn't do anything because he was already in trouble for giving too many comps. Well dude that means you suck as a manager. He kept saying he was a blunt person, and that we must basically suck as customers, and to call the gm Jeff or James (can't remember the name as I was so pissed) the next day if we had such a problem with how we were treated. Mind you my 2 friends he treated so bad are both in strip hospitality that send customers there regularly, and now will stop, and let customers know how bad it is! He finally took the drink off our friends tab that they never ordered and $25 off our even tho the drink was full and the food was all left we well, as a local I will steer far from this place, and tell all visiting friends to do the same! My husband works sales on the strip and will also steer clients elsewhere for lunch as well! They also had a whole section closed down and made people wait so long they left. I'm honestly perplexed as to how this place has 4 stars with how crappy they treat customers!",

I wasn't upset I just was surprised they had the disclaimer. However the manager didn't seem to take it all that serious and offered something to dip the chis in which I declined. I just surprised they put that on their menu then react the way they did when someone actually brings it to their attention. It wasn't busy at the time. That is the reason for not 5 stars.",

SItting there outside, I decided to look at the menu. let me add I was never at a nacho daddy before. I saw they had an American breakfast. I thought myself, they can not mess that up. Well, the server, who I apology I can not remember his name, came over, provided us w/ our drinks, I ordered my food along with everyone else.  When the food came out, which was on average for an eatery in Vegas, I had so much breakfast food I almost could not finish it.  Between the more than average Bacon, and eggs to the hashbrowns.  And the price was average for off the strip prices.  As this was an unexpected trip to a restraunt, it was well worth it and I will be back anytime I go down town.   Lets add my brother and his girl, ordered the normal Nacho Daddy stuff, and they loved it too..",

Always enjoy the food and service at this downtown location but today was a different story! The hostess was so rude and had a serious attitude (young African American with dreadlocks). We waited for a bit when she approached us and my friend asked if we can sit any where....her attitude was so unnecessary as she said \"nope do you want a table or the bar.\" It's not what she said, it is how she said it. We opted for the table and the attitude continued as she put the menus on our table.  We decided to leave because she made us so uncomfortable....moved on over to Triple George Grill (my next review :-) I'm sorry I cannot rate the food this time but to me, food doesn't matter if the experience sucks.  What is happening to the service?!!!!  Nacho Daddy is definitely known for their amazing nachos but when visiting Vegas, we ALWAYS make a stop here...me for the vegetarian crispy street tacos (deep fried avocado tacos). My dad loves the fish tacos...check out this fish taco! We have tried a variety of things on the menu including the vegan nachos....every time We come, we are all happy with our meal. They have it all...breakfast, lunch and dinner and anything you try, is good! Makes this vegetarian happy! They have meals for vegans and of course, lots for the carnivores! And I cannot forget the bar...it has a good variety of spirits. Service is always good. We usually go on a Friday or Saturday by 6:00 pm to beat the crowd! Nacho Daddy is a must try when you are in Las Veg",

The waiter Jon was rude & everything we ordered he kept clarifying the prices. Like HELLO there's a menu here with prices when you do that you make it seem like we can't afford it, that's so unprofessional. I heard another group complaining that they didn't have any server help them either and they were waiting for about 10 mins. The tacos were ok...margarita was ok... They have scorpion shots which is cool just to say you ate a scorpion. But yeah, very mediocre. Wouldn't recommend.",

The green sauce provided in a cup was as good as the authentic stuff from the local taco truck in my hometown. I split the portion with my wife as a small meal to hold us over for dinner. The portion was plenty to split between two people.  All in all, not a bad place for a quick bite, or something on the cheaper side in the area.",

The place is a dimly lit restaurant located on the edge of Fremont, but I wouldn't necessarily classify it as a hole in the wall. I appreciated that it's a pretty unassuming spot. We ordered two Nachos and ate family style, the Nacho Average Burger Nacho and Filet Mignon Nacho. Wow, these nachos are absolutely loaded! We all had our favorite, but mine was the Filet Mignon Nacho. It sounds like a pretty simple substitute for standard nachos, just replacing ground beef with filet mignon and dousing beans, cheese, sour cream, guac, and pico de gallo on top, but that substitute made all the difference. It's the perfect late night snack after hours of crazy shenanigans.",

We ordered the loaded nachos and the spicy burrito to share. Hot damn it was so full of flavor, I almost felt like I was cheating. The nachos were the star of the show for sure. The burrito was a fatty and my half was able to stand up on its own. Solid burrito test.  Vegan friends, I highly recommend.

    "text": "Deciding to come here was an easy compromise for the meateater BF and me. This place gets automatic points from me for having a vegan menu!  The Vegan Nacho was a MOUNTAIN of ingredients including grilled peppers, onions, corn, salsa and pinto beans. There was veggie patty crumbles that I'm pretty indifferent about however the amount of mushrooms seemed to be minimal compared to the ratio of other ingredients. I also wish it had more guacamole but that's more of a personal preference. I was impressed with the amount of cheddar and mozzarella Daiya. Jalapeno chips were stacked pretty high and I was happy to see that the ingredients weren't just piled on top of the chips but layered within the dish. $15 may seem pricey for a plate of nachos but this place makes a genuine effort to make the price worth it. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ic9mRg&s=c32d276f6b1dc22c4b05d6c1ca222322f0d07498df3106168d9c468c4492873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1Ic9mRg</a>  The meateater BF had the Buffalo Hot Nacho which he devoured. I think that means he liked it.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I appreciated that this place wasn't overly cranking the AC like most places do. I understand that Vegas weather is hot but it's inconvenient to have to carry a light sweater just to stay warm indoors.  Overall, I'm a fan! I predict that we'll be back to check out other items on the vegan menu :)",

We were told to put our name on the list and we world receive a text message when the table was ready, no problem. This is when the problem starts, we were seating at the bar right next to the hostess booth and we noticed that she was seating people that came in after us. We asked was the table ready and she rudely replied that we should have checked our text and responded, she then rolled her eyes and continued to seat the other people. I wouldn't have been offended but does it ever occur that sometimes these cell phones don't work properly and besides that we were sitting in her face. I caught her doing something to the iPad and when I looked at my phone that is when I saw the message which is a coincidence or did she neglect to follow through because we weren't a priority. I noticed after being seated she would walk pass our table looking as though she had a problem with us. Mark our server was great and the food was good. Very disappointed in in the initial treatment of entering the restaurant and the treatment of the hostess. Her name started with an A.  I gave three stars because our server was great and made up for rudeness of the hostess.",

Erica was the only good part she was great and patient and kept a smile on her face after runners and bussers messed up food and drink orders. Some of the orders were wrong. Chips and salsa didn't come out before the food so we had to cancel. Blah blah I could go on and on.Bad experience.   Erica gets 5 stars. Restaurant gets none :(",

We ordered 3 pitchers of margarita and 4-5 nachos to share with our table of about 7-8 girls. The seafood nachos were a little spicy, but it was SO BOMB. It might be my favorite one from all of the nachos that we ordered. There's something about the sauce with the lobster that just satisfied my nacho cravings. Another one of my favorites was the pulled pork nachos... love that they don't skimp on the meat!   I typically don't love Mexican food, but I'm digging this place!",

The wait was an hour and 45 minutes, but ended up being less than an hour. Several people had put their name in for tables, but then weren't there when their table was called - awesome for us! The margaritas were great and if you check in with the Yelp App you get a free one with an entree purchase! They were very fresh! We ordered the bottomless chips (chips were still warm) and salsa. We ended up getting all the sauces, but I steered clear of the hot bc of the amount of sliced jalapenos in it. If you're in to heat you might like it. The medium had enough kick for me. Someone also ordered the lobster and crab nachos. I'm not a seafood fan, but they were good! Their queso is awesome! I ended up getting the Signature Soft tacos - one pork and one chicken. I could only eat one! Tortillas were fresh too. Huge portions, but extremely delicious and decent prices too for Vegas and really anywhere. Other people got enchiladas and loved them. Someone else in our group got fajitas and they lit them on fire at the table - super cool. Overall awesome experience and excellent food. I would definitely go back!",

Then, off the Happy Hour menu we got the chicken street tacos, chimichangas, and Nacho Everyday Burger Nachos. All wonderful - full of flavor! Then Chris (the manager) twisted my arm to try the Fried Ice Cream Nachos! Chris - you are EVIL! That stuff is to die for! I'm on a sugar coma! :)  But one of best parts of dinner? ALEX, our waitress!

I will tell you walking up to this location and walking in it looks like a dump, but man oh man was I wrong. Arrived and was seated right away. Service was good nothing magnificent but the food OMG.  Lord was it good. Great flavor and so many selections. I for sure will come back here hands down. Do yourself a favor and don't eat that crap on free mint walk a few steps to nacho daddy!! Only one bad thing. Safe the calories,The free check in margarita suck.",

I liked how the tortilla chips stayed crunchy, they never got soggy, so that was a plus. Stop by if your , around Fremont street.",

    "text": "We arrived around 2:05 on a Sunday afternoon. We waited in the front next to the sign for someone to help us. After 10 minutes, we were finally approached. We were told they are not accepting customers to be seated until 2:25pm because the \"kitchen was backed up\" and was trying to catch up on orders, however when we asked if we could sit at the bar, it was ok...Didn't really make sense but nonetheless, we found some seats available at the bar. I was already somewhat annoyed by waiting around but was so hungry at this point, I just wanted to order some food. There was only one bartender on staff at the time, and after another 7 minutes of waiting, the bartender apologized and said she'll be right with us. Nice gesture, however it would have been nice to have some menus to take advantage of the time we were waiting.  Finally, we got some menus, ordered some drinks (they have a free margarita with yelp check in) and ordered grilled wings and nachos for appetizers. The margarita was on the sweet side. Some of the wings were extra charred. I must admit, they do have several nacho options that all sounded great! We got the crab and lobster nachos. Flavors were there, but wish there was more to each bite. That being said, we would order this again. We ordered the baja seafood combo (fish taco and the lobster and crab enchilada with beans and rice), and the signature Taco-enchilada combo. Both of these dishes were extremely filling. Tortilla for the taco's were delicious and the enchilada was really good too. Prices weren't too bad either considering you're eating in downtown Vegas right next to Fremont St. At this point, we were stuffed and couldn't order dessert. Overall, the food wasn't too bad however our experience dropped this rating to a 3.",

    "text": "This is the second time I have has lunch at this establishment.  Location is north of the strip (is actually in the old downtown section) so traffic actually moves and parking is pretty accessible. This makes any foray to this area much easier and and quicker.  Both times I've been here, I've parked within 100' of the restaurant's entrance.  Nacho Daddy is a pretty cool themed fusion nacho bar.  Portions are decent sized and reasonably priced.  Menu has variety that should appeal to most anyone's palette subject to Mexican type food.  The service was fast, personable and delivered with a smile. I am giving it a four star because the interior's seating is comprised of bar, high stool/table seating, or table seating that is in close proximity to each other, noise off hard surfaces is difficult if one has a hearing impairment.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Nacho Daddy's food; however, the service at this specific location was HORRENDOUS! The hostess made us wait 35 minutes, after telling us we had a 20 minute wait - the same table that was open when we got there was open 35 minutes later. It was not reserved and we had to ask to be seated at that table. We waited another 10 minutes for a waitress. We then ordered our drinks - it took 15 minutes to get 5 waters. The waitress brought 2 waters, then 1 more, then the other 2. The table was filthy and we had to wait more time to get it cleaned. Mind you, during this time frame the restaurant was not busy - there were open tables everywhere. We finally ordered and waited an hour and 10 minutes for our food, while the two tables surrounding us were seated and ordered after we did, receiving their food 20 minutes before we did. The two people at the table next to us were visibly upset that the waitress (same waitress as ours), forgot their coffee and a refill of chips for at least 15 minutes. After speaking up about our food not being served on a timely manner, the waitress was seemingly annoyed and very rude, stating, \"I put the order in, there's nothing I can do,\" and walked away. Once we received our food she said, \"See, it came.\" I'm absolutely appalled at the service, disrespect, and idiocy that we encountered. I will not be returning here, and neither will the other 4 people with me. This was a birthday celebration, a lunch that took over 2 hours to complete, and it ruined the happiness surrounding our birthday girl. Nacho Daddy can do better - get it together.",

I ordered the filet mignon nachos and my partner ordered the tostada nachos. Giant, heaping plates of food were put in front of us, and I was taken aback at how much was on the plate. But it was good. All the ingredients were perfectly proportioned and spread out nicely across the plate, so you got a little bit of everything with one bite. I had no complaints at all about what I ordered.  The service was good as well. If our server was busy, the manager came by and checked on us. All in all, it was a good experience.",

They had it on top of a candle to keep the cheese warm. The corn was good also.  I ordered the filet Mignon nachos and hubby got the chicken burrito.  The burrito must've been good because there wasn't any left over.  My nachos....can we say delish! The portions there are huge!  I couldn't even finish half of it.  The steak was moist and tender, it was just good .  I'm so glad that this was our last stop on vacation! Oh and I forgot to mention the free house margarita  It was small but it definitely packed a punch!",

Everyone was very apologetic but you can see what they will willingly do about it. I doubt very seriously if the couple and I were reversed if it would have gone that way.",

They have variations on all sorts of nachos and if you consider nachos as a family meal, this place is heaven. We had the fiesta nachos and Thai chicken nachos. I wasn't a fan of the Thai chicken but it was a good attempt and I liked the flavors. The fiesta nachos were your standard plate of nachos with Mexican toppings. This isn't a place for a fancy date (not that Fremont street is the first choice in taking your SO for a fancy date), but it's great to have a beer, eat good nachos, and watch the game.  It's somewhat loud, but the service staff is nice and accomodating.",

Because of the food/ drinks and superb service this will become one of those restaurants that we return to every time we are I'm Vegas.

    "text": "I was trying to give this place 3.5 stars, but it looks like the option is only 3 or 4.  Nacho Daddy is located in the heart of Downtown, Las Vegas, just a couple blocks down from where I work. I've tried several of their dishes and have never walked away with that \"wow\" factor. Their nachos are very satisfying, and they come with a heap load of toppings to ensure that every chip has some kind of yumminess on it. The BBQ nachos are the best, in my opinion.   I've tried their filet beef street tacos. The beef is cut into very small pieces, and then topped with a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. The food is then placed on two mini corn tortillas. The tacos do the job, don't get me wrong, but the meat was a bit overcooked to my liking, and I had to add a bit of hot sauce to keep the tacos moist. Again, not a terrible meal.     My favorite thing on the menu is their fish tacos. This is definitely a dish I would go back for!! The fish is slathered in herbs and spices and then thrown on the grill for good measure. The well flavored filet is then topped with cabbage and a little salsa, but the best part is the thick handmade tortilla it comes on. Everything works together well, and two of these babies will definitely leave you with a smile.   The service at Nacho Daddy is okay, and the environment is relaxing with a nod to the famous 90's bands playing on the TVs. All in all, I'll be back.",

The dining area was pretty busy, we were told to seat ourselves at the only available table and a server came over fairly quickly to inquire if a highchair was needed (it was).   We started out by ordering drinks, I had a moscow mule which was served in a silver mug (I should dock Nacho Daddy one star just for that BS). For an appetizer, we got the triple dip which is queso dip, guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was chunky and looked great but lacked seasoning, and queso dip came with sliced jalapenos in it however no heat could be detected by anyone in our group, which became the standard for our evening.   My husband got a combo which was a 1/2 a sandwich and a bowl of the ghost pepper chili. My brother in law had the ghost pepper chili nachos. Both commented on the lack of heat in their meals. The shrimp bowl I had was fine, as was the quesadilla that my sister in law had. Nothing was exceptional though.   For me there are too many good places to dine downtown for me to go back to a place that was 'just okay' anytime soon. Sorry Nacho Daddy, you just didn't do it for me.",

We also got the chimi (pork & beef) which were huge! I recommend sharing! But they we very good everyone agreed. We had someone get the Mexican corn & breakfast burrito which was awesome too.

Love the nacho options and how easy it is to customize them.  Breakfast is nice for a group because they have lots of options from plan old eggs, to creative Mexican.  Has a great vibe, nice and casual but welcoming.  Love the open windows.  They have a small patio area in front.  One of our downtown favorites.",

The restroom smelled and the floors were wet, at least the men's side.   We ordered the Vegas Golden Knight nachos which feeds  about two. It tasted real good but it was very skimpy on the meat. There were plenty of peppers, onions, and cheese sauce but just lacked the filet mignon. It tasted a lot like fajitas. For $20 I expected more meat. Anyways, I don't see myself going back due to the high prices but at least I can say I've tried it.",

They also flame the fajitas in front of you which is cool.   I think Mark was our server that night and he was super attentive and friendly, coming to check on us several times.   Pretty chill / casual environment. Not overly loud, but a good amount of people in the restaurant. They also have a bar area.   Would definitely come back for the margaritas.  And maybe their breakfast food next time.",

We also ordered the Mexican grilled corn, that was tasty too! We ordered the supreme nachos with seasoned ground beef, Pico de Gallo, guacamole, cheese, and homemade chips.  The chips were so light and airy, almost like flour tortilla chips. Large portion, fed the 2 of us no problem.  Bonus was the free house margarita when you check in on Yelp!  They gave us the option of upgrading to a specialty margarita and give us $8 credit (for each drink) if we wanted.  We stuck with the original House margarita, you're also given the choice of on the rocks or frozen. When in the mood for some nachos, we'll definitely be back,",

We waited 15 minutes before we were even offered a table. We were looked at by servers walking around but never once acknowledged us until 15 minutes later! Then we both were without drinks for periods of time while they walked on by. I get busy but not bad service. For the server to commit fraud and charge my cc for his tip is completely absurd. I highly recommend cash only as apparently the servers consider your credit card theres to charge whatever they want for tips regardless if you're okay with it or not. FRAUD WARNING!!",

    "text": "TL;DR + Killer mexican grub, great portions, delicious drinks, good atmosphere, great service - Seating area can be a tad cramped, maybe a wait YMMV  Orale!!!  As if the name wasn't enough...this place is no joke.  Visiting LV and some friends and I were deciding on dinner.  Tossup between here and somewhere else. Glad we chose Nacho Daddy.  Service: Seated promptly, served quickly.  Mark was our server and he was incredible.  Great recommendations on margarita flavors, food options, checked back often enough to make sure we had all we need but was never overbearing.  Food: Food was great.  Friends had vegetarian nachos, a HUGE burrito that looked like a baby swaddled in a blanket smothered in sauce, and I opted for the street tacos.  Started with chips and queso.  Queso warmed at the table via candle and that was a nice touch as who the hell likes cold queso?  Other restaurants, step it up! I'm tired of slamming my chips and queso because you serve me lukewarm cheese that turns to Lake Placid before I'm even halfway through the chips.  Lock it up, ya'll!!  Portions, needless to say, were huge.  Street tacos were *la bomba*.  Nachos looked to be delicious and although the burrito was massive, my friend finished it, so plus on not having to lug a to-go box around.  Bevs: Got two pitchers of margaritas, the mango and blood orange.  Both had equal portions of flavor and booze.  For sure thought we'd get shorted on the tequila, but after the first pitcher I knew that was a lie.  Overall this place is a huge win.  Will definitely make it point to come back next time I'm in LV.",

Based on other patron reviews we figured to give it a try.  We were not disappointed!  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and offered a table immediately.  Our server came over to our table just as we sat down and had a super awesome attitude. Grabbed our beverages quickly and took our order without delay.  Once we did get our food we were surprised by the amount of the serving! It keep me full for most of he day. My son ordered the Nachos with cheese and jalapeno and to be honest, he ate every single last nacho on his dish. He was in heaven. I had the bbq pork and it was surely on point, the bbq sauce and pork were perfect. My wife ordered a chicken chimmey changa and it was massive. With the size of that order the chicken was perfect and the crispyness of the changa was perfect.  Overall I would tell anyone who wanted to try our something more then your average run of the mill eatery to give this place a try. It was welcoming to my family and the food was delicious.",

    "text": "Came here on the night of St Patricks Day after going around Fremont for a while. When we had arrived around 12ish 1am, the hostess told us it was about a 45 minute wait for a table but seeing there was room at the bar, we sat at the bar immediately. As with most places in downtown, the establishment is kind of old and dirty and it being a bar, it was kinda dark too.  The bartender tended to us almost immediately after we sat down, giving us food menu and asked us for drinks. We had ordered some margaritas as well as use the check in offer for a free house margarita. We ordered 2 items of food to share as well.   Supreme Tostada Nacho - seasoned ground beef, cheese blend, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapenos, lettuce, avocado lime salsita, sour cream & guacamole on top of house made corn chips - despite the price of the nachos, it is probably one of the better if not best nachos ive had. Granted i don't normally get nachos but with the few places i have, this is much better. Lots of toppings. Ground beef seasoned well. If anything, there was more toppings than chips. After the first initial chips, we started having to fish for chips. By the end, we asked for some forks to help eat. Lol   Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cob - basted in seasoning, cojita cheese, cilantro, garlic mayo and fresh lime - small pieces of corn. Maybe 1/3 the size of a normal corn. 2 per order. Expected more. Flavor wise was pretty decent. Would have been nice to have more cheese.   I personally ordered the Blood Orange Margarita whereas a friend ordered the White Peach version and another had the free House Margarita with yelp check in. Apparently mine was the strongest? but since i drank mine first, the other ones didn't taste much different. LOL except sweet :3 I'm a fan of blood orange drinks, be it alcohol or non-alcoholic (San Pellegrino).   Service was pretty good. Got immediate attention as soon as we sat down. Got waters. Got drinks. Food came pretty fast. Pretty attentive staff. Not bad besides the location.",

    "text": "Service: The customer service is excellent. Everyone is very nice. Dalvik was serving our food, while Sara was our waitress. Both were very helpful in my decisions to pick my food.  Food: margaritas were great. White peach is way better than the house original.  The appetizer ordered was the extreme tostada nacho. They were great. Real tortilla chips. Ground beef. And cheese. Great cheese. And it comfortably fed four hungover people. (Big plus on that) I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. The chorizo was mild and not what I find in a Mexican supermarket.  My girlfriend ordered the green enchilada. She loved it. The sauce was the most notable. The refried beans however, should have came from a different can. The rice was good. A little crunchy but the enchiladas made her forget.  The big day burrito was fucking good, said my friend. He ate it all.  The big daddy bowl was excellent.   My opinion, if you were raised in America with parents making Mexican food, you'll love it here; it's great Americanized Mexican food. If you're an immigrant, you might want to stick to the hole in the wall down the street.",

    "text": "Ok...  so lets preface this review by saying we rolled in here at 2 am, completely annihilated.  We didn't order any drinks.  We were WAY past that point.  We did, however, need sustenance.  So the 4 of us split some wings and a plate of nachos.  Both were hits.  Service was grate, they were well accustomed to our kind and we're funny and didn't get annoyed with the drunken antics.  We sat outside so I can't really speak much to the inside except the bathrooms.  They could have been a bit cleaner but at 2am on a saturday in Vegas, beggars can't be choosers and I was just happy they were functional. The guys actually wanted to come back the next night for drunk food, it was solid.  If you happen to be downtown late at night, you should stop in.",

My best friend is in love with this place & I'm glad she dragged me along once more to give it another try. Super cool how you check in on yelp and get a house margarita for free! Love it!",

Secondly, there was so much beans they overpowered the other toppings and made the chips soggy. And although our waitress asked for extra cheese there was hardly any and it was all dropped in one spot, so basically on like three chips.   Third the toppings are only on one layer. For this price point, and considering nachos are the main schtick, you'd think they could sprinkle and melt some cheese on the bottom layer.   The guacamole and ranchero sauce were good and so was the service, but overall I left feeling like I had just had poorly assembled, overpriced bar food and not a specialty dish of a restaurant with a main focus on nachos.",

    "text": "This was one of the biggest food let downs I've had in a while. I was really excited about trying their Nachos, expecting something unique that would set them apart from typical Nachos at any other bar/grille.   They were certainly short handed, because we ordered our drinks and then after what seemed like forever, we had to find our server to make our order.  I ordered the Enchilada Nachos, my wife ordered the Vegan Nachos, my daughter ordered the chicken fingers.   It was alright. I kept thinking that I could have done far better myself. Maybe I just ordered the wrong item, but my wife absolutely hated her Vegan Nachos. So I tasted one of hers and the cheese tasted horrible. She almost asked them to take it back, but we couldn't find our server for so long that she ended up forcing down half of it by the time he came back around and it didn't seem right.  My daughter's chicken fingers were very good! At least they got that right.  So, if you're looking for nachos that make you say, 'meh', get the Enchilada Nachos. If you are starving and long for cheese that tastes like melted plastic, get the Vegan Nachos.  But if for some reason you find yourself in this average restaurant and you aren't the 'risk-taking' type, ask for the kid's menu and order the chicken strips. They are called 'pull my finger'.",

We were greeted inside and it was a beautiful day out despite the wind so we opted for the patio seating.  He said no problem and immediately noticed the table needing to be wiped be cause of rain and dust in the air recently.  He quickly got a rag and took care of the issue with out us requesting.   Good eye Ric.    He took our drink order promptly and brought them out at the same pace.  We were not in a rush by any means but ussually we like to get service going quickly because of the kids and there short attention span.  Ric followed up for our order when he could. There was another group asking him what seemed like 1000 questions but like I said I understood the circumstances.  We were just enjoying the weather andthe kids were coloring because Ric was ontop of it and brought us the color pages and crayons.    We began to inquire about food options at Nacho Daddy regarding portions and veggie options and he informed us they had an entire page dedicated to Vegan eating.  Sweet! Mom said.  This was our first meal of the day even though it was 5 in the afternoon.  So Ric quickly brought us a great bucket of chips, two salsas, and cheese dip like queso fundido type thing.  All were very good. Salsa tasted fresh and homemade with a little bit of heat.  Cheese dip was good also.  Mom went with the Black Bean Burger and could not decide between garlic or sweet potato fries, Ric quickly responded with I can split between both if you like.  Awesome job again my friend.  I went for the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos, which had very good flavor and a huge portion.  My one issue with this dish is that it tasted like the pork had been sitting in the hotwell all day so the meat was very tough and chewy.  My jaw bones seriously hurt after finishing this dish.  I am not one to complain but that issue did not stop me from killing the entire plate.  I give the dish a 3.5 star out of 5 because of the chewyness. Mom had no issues with her burger and fires she had no trouble crushing this dish either.    Overall great first experience.  Ric made it 5 stars.  He is possibly one of the best in all of DTLV.  We had to speak to the manager to let her know about how great Ric was.  We will be back to visit Ric soon.  The food was also good enough to come back and explore the menu further.  Thanks for the good time.",

We paid $50 before the tip for two entrees, a 24oz mug of beer, and a margarita. While it's a bit pricey compared to a standard Mexican restaurant, it's very understandable once you see the portions. They don't skimp on anything here! I ordered the four cheese nachos and they were the best nachos I've ever had, and I don't think that was the shots talking ;) There wasn't a dry chip on my plate and the chips were strong enough to hold all the cheese and jalapenos. My boyfriend ordered enchiladas and it came with refried beans and Mexican rice, also looked great. The peach margarita was perfect. We went for my birthday and our server offered me a free shot, which K9 looked like straight tequila; it would have been $7 if it wasn't comped. I made a reservation on OpenTable, where their site redirected me to, and it looks like I made it for 9pm instead of 6pm, when we went. The hostess didn't ask if we had reservations because it was slow enough, but it started to pick up when we left around 7pm. Our server was great at making sure we had everything and we're happy with how our food was. I've never been to the one on the strip but I'd definitely recommend the downtown/Fremont location.",

Both very good, but the enchilada one was amazing. Consist of Green salsa with pulled chicken refried beans and of course cheese. We ate it so fast I didn't even take a picture.  The buffalo nachos needed more queso blanco, I had to order a side of it because it felt like I was just eating chips covered in buffalo sauce.  The strawberry margarita was very tasty. I def recommend.   The next day we wanted to come here again but wanted to give other restaurants the opportunity. Now I regret leaving Vegas without visiting this place twice.

Shabby, not chic, Nacho Daddy's a restaurant that feels and appears rundown. Music videos from the early to mid-2000's serenade diners as they crunch down onto their exotic nachos.   Kale Salad ($6.95): What a way to make someone feel like a heifer digging in the grass for the \"good stuff.\" This is an enormous bowl filled with kale and sparse toppings of avocado slices, chunks of grilled corn, and cherry tomatoes. Too much kale and not enough toppings. The dressing, which was an oily citric concoction, didn't add flavor.   Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos ($16.95): We paid 16 bucks for some bland-ass  nachos. Though they were loaded with guacamole, pico de gallo, refried beans, cilantro, and \"filet mignon,\"  these were disappointingly flavorless.   The carne asada nachos here don't even stack up to what my neighborhood Roberto's offers, or any kind nachos offered elsewhere. Not worth the trip, the cash, the calories, and waking up to the feeling of regret caused by the previous evening's dinner.",

I love the cheese they use and the sauces are delicious. I have come here many options and each time it does not disappoint, very consistent food. I even ordered the nachos to-go and they were just as good. Would highly recommend! The menu has so many options, as well as vegan friendly options.",

Alas, the taco was missing the bacon as well, must have left it back in the kitchen with the chips. Cancelled the chips order and had them bring a slice of bacon for the taco. Server never once checked on us through the entire meal, had to get order corrected from other servers loading by. Aside from the service, food tasted good, probably won't come here again.",

    "text": "Short review this time because hubby and I just stopped in for appetizers.  They do have a 'free house margarita' when you check in with Yelp; however, it's only with the purchase of an entree.  We started with the unlimited chips and salsa, and asked for both the mild and medium salsa, which was not a problem  We also ordered the chips and queso, which is a white queso, with pico and jalapenos (on the side please).  Hubby ordered a regular margarita with salt and I opted for a frozen without salt.  They're served in these little mason jar things and were surprisingly yummy (and you could taste the booze).  We had originally planned on ordering an entree to split; however, by the time we put a dent in the chips, salsa and queso, we were full!  Next time, nachos or bust!  When we told our waitress Perla M. that we were too full to order an entree, she explained the free margaritas with yelp check-in required an entree purchase.  Completely understandable (and still a very generous offer) and we said 'hey, no worries, we understand' and she said she'd try to 'help us out'.  She returned a few minutes later and said she was able to get our drinks comped for us!  That was completely unnecessary but very much appreciated!  We will definitely return when we're back in town and I highly recommend everyone give them a shot - if for nothing else, the customer service was amazing!",

I ended up ordering a pineapple mint margarita, which was amazing. For food we ordered trio of white queso, salsa, guacamole. The white queso is really Siri and this also is really in; however, in the guacamole could've used a little bit north. Additionally the waiter was a bit overworked, there was a long delay for my margarita. It was sitting at the bar for 20 minutes before another waiter brought it to our table. I would definitely recommend visiting this restaurant if you like nachos.",

Unfortunately, there was a mix up and those who ordered later somehow got their food first. The waitress and manager were extremely apologetic and remedied the situation by providing our party with chips, salsa and a round of shots! How great are they? The food was fantastic (pulled pork nachos, ceviche, chilaquiles and shrimp tacos.) We also enjoyed a pitcher of their house margarita which was delicious. If I could give this place 17 stars I would. Thank you for the hospitality Nacho Daddy!",

Being from Texas we are sometimes a little hesitant having 'Mexican' food away from home.  Our waiter was amazing.  He explained the menu items we had questions about.  We began with an order of quesadillas and child and queso.  He even brought us an extra order.  The queso was blanco so that was a bit of a surprise but still good.  He brought my friend and I a Birthday shot of tequila since we mentioned we were in Vegas celebrating our birthdays.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner.  This is a must go to place if you are in the area.",

Prices were high, but food was nicely done. Caution: everything has a kick to it, spices are great for those of you that can tolerate a burning in your mouth type of sensation. I was happy that the pork wasn't so spicy.  And the fried ice cream with the churro chips now have a special place in my heart.",

    "text": "Catchy name for a place, so I had it on my list to try during this visit. Plus I like Mexican food in all forms, so hanging out here should be easy.   Turned out to be a good place to grab a solo lunch. I came in around 12:00 pm on a Monday and was just about the only customer in the place (save for the woman on her laptop at the bar, I really was it). Surprising, so I was instantly concerned the food must be bad. Or you'd need to be liquored up with a bunch of tequila to be happy here, which wasn't on the menu for me. Fortunately, the food did not disappoint but more on that in a moment.   Let's talk 'bout yo daddy...  Nacho Daddy is larger inside than it appears from outside. There is a spacious wraparound bar and a separate dining area with plenty of seating. There is also outdoor seating with umbrellas, although they had to take them down while I was there due to excessive winds.   Server Nicole was down to earth and cordial. She was training a new guy and he seemed to be catching on quick. The manager came over to say hello to me, his sole customer. : ) Nice touch.   Oh and the food. I had the chicken taco and can honestly say, it was one of the best taco's I've ever had. They mix some kind of pesto sauce into the taco that complements it very well.  I commented upon this just before leaving and they weren't sure what it was, but were glad I liked it. Well now, I'm glad too.   The manager's cool. The staff nice. The food excellent. The environment very comfortable. I'm not sure why it was empty both before I arrived and after I left. Maybe it's just a quiet Monday. I'll bet the place lights up at night.   Definitely worth a visit if you're downtown. Lots of options on the menu. And if you like tequila, this is your place.",

I ordered a second one after finishing the free one and it was much stronger than the first, although that might've just been due to a different bartender making it.   There was a 20-25 min wait when we came here around 5pm on a Saturday, so we opted to sit at the bar instead, which also has the full menu available. We got the filet mignon nachos and the surf and turf taco combo. The nachos came with a lot, probably enough to share between 3-4 people. There was a good amount of toppings but the filet mignon was overcooked and dry. The tacos were a good size for an entree and had freshly made flour tortillas that are very similar to Singaporean/Malaysian roti bread instead of the traditional texture. Loved the flakiness of it!   Fun atmosphere and they played a lot of 90s/early 2000s music, which was cool.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and presentation. If you're here, get the Nachos -it's what they are known for .  I don't eat nachos because i don't eat cheese but they actually had vegan cheese so i ordered the Chinga chicken nachos hold the beans, sour cream and sub vegan cheese.  It was massive. Enough for 4 people with some left over. And only like 13 bucks.  Lots of tender shredded chicken and other toppings so your chips do get soggy .   Margarita on point abd you get a free house marg if you check in !   Pros good food /drinks and great service  Cons: very loud . You can't hear the people at your table .",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy has the bigger location on the Strip by Harmon. It also has a downtown location. It's hard to say which is the better one. Let's just say they're both good. The drinks and food are the same at both so I like either of these.   It has a few differences in the atmosphere. It's not as big as the other location. This means it's much more crowded and harder to find a seat. It's better to bring a smaller group. They have about the exact same menu as the other place. If you check in you get a free margarita. Just that is enough to get me here, but I have been happy with my food too. It has all kinds of choices for those with dietary restrictions. There's many choices for vegetarians. I like the burrito. It's very dense. They pack a lot into it. It has so much to choose from. The vegetarian tacos aren't too big but they are good for a late night meal. It comes in three tacos with a side of beans. It's about $10, which isn't more expensive at most places for this kind of item. They use vegan cheese, which melts like the real thing.   It has so many good items to choose from. Be sure to get the nachos. These make a terrific group platter, and yes they have vegetarian versions.",

We stopped in for some late night eats Friday night after having a great time in downtown Vegas at the Fremont Street Experience.  Nacho Daddy is easy to find, and is near SlotZilla.  We ordered a couple of items to share (lobster tacos and fiesta nachos) and Daddy's Margaritas.  Everything was SO YUMMY!  Our food was served hot and fresh.  Both the lobster tacos and the fiesta nachos were so good, and loaded.  They definitely do not skimp at Nacho Daddy.  And let's not forget about Daddy's Margaritas...WOW!  They are served in huge glasses and are perfectly sour...DELISH!  This place gets crazy packed on the weekend, but well worth the wait. On that note, Dear Nacho Daddy, I LOVE U, and can't wait to see you again...lol! Love, Michelle",

We wanted some vegan/vegetarian options and they had an entire page dedicated to vegan Mexican dishes.   I had the vegan nachos and my wife had the vegan quesadilla that she raves and ranted about.  My kiddo had the bbq wings that he devoured.   The service was fun, polite and super prompt.  I also walked in and checked in with the yelp app and got a free house margarita with an entree order so, score for me!!  So don't let the exterior fool you and enjoy the great fare and inexpensive drink options (especially during happy hour)  Enjoy yourself folks!!",

    "text": "Last Saturday, the Mrs. and I decided to take an impromptu overnight trip to Vegas. After checking in at the El Cortez, we made our way over to Nacho Daddy in the 93 degree heat.   We arrived close to 1 p.m. and the place was busy. Being that Nacho Daddy is in a major tourist area, I expected the crowd. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad. Sabrina arrived to take our order and asked us if we wanted to start out with a Margarita. After all, when in Vegas, right? I ordered the Cadillac Margarita and the wife ordered Daddy's Margarita. Both were really good and the size of the Margarita's are very generous.   I think building a restaurant concept around nachos is a great idea because nachos are sharable and are a very social food. Nacho Daddy does a great job in taking nachos to another level. On the menu, Nacho Daddy lists their nachos under \"Traditional Tastes\", however, in my view, many of the nachos listed are far from traditional. We decided to go for the gold and ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho.   The Supreme Tostada Nacho was piled high with seasoned ground beef, cheese blend, yellow queso, refried beans, pico de gallo, fried jalapenos, lettuce, avocado lime salsita, sour cream and guacamole on top of house-made chips. It was a feats for the eyes and the stomach. Two people could easily destroy them....and we did.   There are also other things on the menu like tacos and fajitas. Several people around us ordered the fajitas and they smelled incredible. The menu also has several Gluten Free options as well. A full bar is offered is for those of you who aren't into Margaritas(If you aren't then that ain't right.).",

Our server was so sweet despite how hectic it was in there. The margarita's are definitely worth it, I finished 2! And if you can't finish it--ask for a 2-go cup.   I got the Nacho's and I almost finished all of it. It has a hint of spice to it, but incredible flavors and toppings... the chips are crispy and what's inside is fresh. I like mine with extra sour cream!   Over all, whatever you get on the menu is going to be good, and the food will come out quickly. There's a ton of servers in the place and it's not that large too--you'll love this place.",

Maybe because they're on the end of Fremont and expect everyone coming in later at night to be a drunken mess. Maybe because the bartender just didn't care? Who knows. What I do know is that we sat at the bar top and the bartender was more focused on speaking to everyone that worked there rather then us.   The food tasted great but made both of us feel sick after. Not to the point of getting sick, but the uncomfortable feeling in your stomach when your body tells you that was you consumed was a poor choice. If it was just me, I wouldn't have given it a second thought but it was both of us and we shared food.    My experience clearly wasn't the best. I most likely won't come back obviously there is something about this place that people really enjoy. Could have been a one off that our time here wasn't great.

We get there and are greeted by a host she asked for our information and wrote all down on a napkin (red flag #1).... Told us it was going to be 10 minutes so we can get seated...im over here thinking sweet....  Now this is where you find out why this place is getting one star... 4 huge parties of 5 came up and her Manager (big tall bald Caucasian man) comes out... Doesnt even look to see if there were people waiting for a table at the host podium and starts seating the groups down.... (Red flag #2)  This is where it gets good... The waitress now comes out with a tablet and is checking people in... And is seating them inside Now my wife is irritated so she asks the hostess if she remebered we were here  The hostess asked for our information again and entered it into the tablet... When asked why bigger parties were being sat before us she stated that it was because they needed to sit a bigger tables.... And other parties of two were trying to be seated and were quoted 30-45 minutes... Well maybe that's because your \"bigger parties\" just filled the stables we couldve sat at...  So we gave it a little longer to give them the benefit of the doubt   The Manager then comes back out not looking at the tablet once again and is seating people left and right.... By this time I am completely over this place and my wife and I left..... The worst communication between managment and staff...no customer service better yet a lack there of... If we wouldve been sat we wouldve been in and out of there.... But this location rather seat larger parties to make more money as opposed to seating small ones...  And to put the cherry on top to this beautiful 1 star rating.... We then get a text at 10:40pm that our table was ready.... We both laughed it off and went about our night",

He is a carnivore well I am a vegetarian and I remember seeing something about this place having vegetarian options so we decided to check it out. Let me tell you, I was impressed!  I should also say that I'm usually pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food but this place satisfied me. We each got margaritas, he got the daddy margarita (regular margarita) and I got the blood orange margarita which was absolutely fantastic and very strong so beware!   We also ordered some queso as an appetizer which was good but nothing special,I would say better than velveeta but not necessary to get again. The pico de Gallo and guac were on point though - and that's coming from a Texas girl.   I absolutely love the fact that they have a whole page dedicated to just vegan options. Trust me when I say that means a lot when I am able to eat a good amount of food at the same restaurant as my friends. I ordered the vegan chicken quesadilla which was phenomenal and tasted great even reheated the next day. It came with vegan cheese and seasoned chicken inside as well as vegan sour cream,guac, and pico. The cheese tasted like they used follow your heart cheese - for those that are picky (like me).   For those of you who are brave and have a strong stomach they also have something called a scorpion shot... yes it is exactly what it sounds like. It is a shot of tequila with a whole scorpion it it. No thank you. Personally I'd rather spend $21 on a margarita or two but my friend did it and it was kind of a fun little novelty thing. They also give you a souvenir shot glass if you do the scorpion shot.   Overall Ill definitely be back! The people were very nice, the service was quick, and the food was great!",

    "text": "I got the Las Vegas Golden Knights Nachos which features filet mignon and both liquid and grated cheese.   The Nachos were so good. Previously, I had a bad experience with the pico de Gallo here. Don't even risk it, it had old tomatoes so the pico de Gallo tasted like a grainy salsa. It was so horrible.   However, the dish without salsa/pico de gallo is really good. My SO got a lime peach margarita which came out quickly. The service was great and the food was a nice snack.   The nachos are pretty big so plan on sharing two dishes (one nachos and one entree) between two people. Two entrees and a nachos to share is way too much food.",

Well, here's the specifics.  The margarita I ordered was not bad nor was it great, i.e., it was merely an average, ordinary margarita.  The grilled fish tacos were bland which constitutes neither bad nor great, i.e., they were average.  Finally, the beans and rice were as average as you would expect from a chain restaurant.  There was nothing distinctly favorable relative to the flavor of the margarita, the fish tacos, the beans, or the rice.  This place isn't bad.  This place isn't great.  IT IS MERELY AVERAGE!",

    "text": "This was my first time to Nacho Daddy and I was pretty excited about it since I've seen them around town and my friend said they had pretty good nachos. We were also in the mood to have some margaritas so we figured perfect! We ordered our fiesta nachos and the nacho burger nachos or something like that, both of which were super yummy. We had a super nice server named Luis who gave us great service and sold us on not getting individual margaritas. He said we'd be better getting the pitchers cause we could get 4-5 margaritas each for less price so we were like done! Took 2 pitches between 5 of us. When he came out pouring the first pitcher it only filled up 4 of them just over half way. He had to use some of the second pitcher to fill ours more but then stopped half way through the second he realized we were clearly being shorted. He left with the still half pitcher and came back with it filled back up. In the end we all only had 1-1.5 drinks each. One of my friends asked for a manger and explained to him the situation and just felt like we were a little shorted and we were really nice about letting him know. Honestly we probably could've gone without even mentioning it and leaving barely satisfied with the situation but we decided let's just let him know. The first thing out of his mouth when we explained to him he said so you only had 1 1/2 drinks each? That's hard to believe. Ok no big deal. We just elaborated and he seriously did not care AT ALL about it. He was like well I sent you out a whole new pitcher and we were like well you took the half filled pitcher back first and just filled it with ice. After the shortest discussion ever he literally said ok well have a good night. I work in a customer service industry as a manager and it's our job to, even if there's not much we can do, to make sure the customer is happy. I'm not exactly sure how he was trained as manager or if customer service is of ANY important to Nacho Daddy but that was my first experience with the company and it's left a sour taste in all of our mouths because of it. The managers name was Rob apparently and I can't express the extent of how he just could not be bothered with us and in no way were we \"those\" kind of customers. We just wanted to let him know and he gave two shits about it. I don't know if any of us will come back, who knows. But total douche of a manager and that sucks cause other than our experience with him...everything wasn't too bad.",

Sure it's just a gimmick, but its fun, especially when they announce it and start ringing the bell.  Fun atmosphere.  I'm not a tequila expert, but they have so many different types it's amazing, if your into tequila this place is a must stop.  Always a favorite when I'm downtown.

Our server was really friendly and energetic; no issues there. The problem was the service times! We started out with drinks that took a bit of time to get to the table. We then placed our orders and waited FORTY MINUTES for our food. Our server came over at about the 30 minute mark and said it would be out shortly. After 40 minutes I would expect some acknowledgement that the wait time was insane and maybe a comp'd serving of chips and salsa since they aren't supplied for free.   The Nacho Average Burger Nachos were tasty with melty nacho cheese, ground beef, thin crispy chips, bacon, red onion, lettuce and tomatoes. They let us know that the portion would be enough for 2 but because I love to eat, I finished it all on my own. They serve breakfast all day but my sister's breakfast burrito was sad. When you think breakfast burrito, you expect something massive. Hers was small, and filled mostly with eggs. She had to dig around for the bacon and they forgot the avocado that she added. It was a disappointing dish for her, but everyone else was pleased. I'm not sure if the 40 minute wait time was a one-off thing but I hope they adjust that soon.",

Definitely a 2 person portion if you want to make it a meal! The filet mignon nachos with a Bloody Mary totally constitutes brunch, right?! Also, lots of room and not much of a wait, great for 2ppl or your entire squad.  I definitely need to come back for a margi and chilaquiles!!!",

    "text": "The owner of this location should be embarrassed.  As a frequent customer of the Eastern location until it closed, it was night and day.    Walking in on a Saturday evening we figured it would be busy.   There were seats open at the bar so we snagged them up.   I wish we didn't.  The service around the bar was absolutely horrid.  First off it took them ten minutes to acknowledge our existence to take our drink order. Since we already knew what we wanted to share, we put in our order right away before she left.  That was the last we saw of our original waitress.  45 minutes later our food comes out.  It was delivered by another waiter and he asked if we needed anything else.  I politely asked for hot sauce as well as our plates and napkins.   Did we see him again?  No.  Was our waitress in sight? No.  So we are sitting there with our drinks empty for the last 25 minutes without regular place settings to eat.  My friend actually went back to the kitchen to see if we could get any assistance. He got their attention.  As we started to eat our so called Nachos, it was abundantly clear they were inedible.  The flavor was way off.  The entire bottom of the plate was water.  I would like to refer to these plate of nachos as nacho soup.  As if those weren't bad enough, the fajita sandwich tasted as if it was made the day before and sitting under heat lamps.  Was I in the twilight zone?  I just want to also mention we did not see our waitress during this entire time.    Eventually we were able to flag down another person to pay our bill.  We wanted to get out of there and never look back.  Just a disappointing experience.",

Talk about divey ... everything you want when you're in the City of Sin!  I think our bartender/waitress was Brianne and she was cool.  I ended up with the ceviche which was really good.  I honestly do not recall what I had to drink, most likely some sort of skinny margarita or something.  I did try my friend's nachos and they were good.  The chips stayed crispy .. probably the best nachos I have had in a long time.  This is on my list of \"must haves\" next time I'm in Vegas.",

I'm asking for a vegan menu I'm also ordering a vegan item and Iam wearing a Vegan  T-Shirt and Vegan hat. Why Anya do you have to tell me its not real chicken???.  The food was ok as usually. I wish they used gardin chicken or beyond meat chicken. I might remove this review. When I visit this place and the staff is respectful to Vegans.",

Now I'm no prude but I don't particularly care to hear the F word or the N word 800 times while I'm eating! The food however for the most part was very good! I had the street tacos, one Carnitas, one Chicken, and one Shrimp! All were delicious! I also ordered chips and salsa! The salsa was underwhelming (whole pickled jalapenos) muy no Bueno! But the chips were hot and fresh and plentiful! Service was good as well! Will try again but during the day when perhaps it is quieter!",

To be fair, it was hard to tell the tortilla chips were house-made (I'll take their word for it), and the open doors attracted a couple flies (which I'm willing to live with). In any event, beer options are decent. They offer flights. The beers brewed for the restaurant are just ok, nothing great, though I think the brewer is Bad Beat, which makes some good stuff. Still, they have some other options like 90 minute IPA. Fun place for a crowd.",

But there wasn't any room at the bar. It was awkward standing by the door.   But hold up, what are all these empty tables for? There were 4-5 of them. We asked a staff member walking by. \"For people at the bar waiting for their tables,\" she said.   What the hell? Well get them seated! Clear up the bar. Get things moving, Jesus. Unless it's taken them so long to update these people on the status of their table, that they decided to dine at the bar.   This seemed to be the case, because when we brought it to the hostess attention, we got a table a minute later. But this shouldn't have happened. It wasted a lot of our time.  As for the food, I got the Golden Nights nachos again, since they were so good the first time. What I got was a plate of dry chips covered in onions and peppers and little else. Almost no cheese and a few pieces of steak on top.   I never got a refill on my water, or extra napkins.   So disappointed in the Nacho Daddy team this time.",

    "text": "We came into Nacho Daddy on a Saturday night, which I understand is a busy time for nearly all restaurants especially at high traffic locations, but after waiting nearly an hour to get a table. The service was not good. We had to wait at our table nearly fifteen minutes before we were even greeted by our server, and by then we all had our drink and food orders prepared but our server didn't give us the option to order so we had to wait another ten minutes... Once ordering our drinks and food we received it about 30 minutes later which in my opinion is too long for any food order let alone drink order. We were also not given utensils and had to walk up and personally ask a staff member for utensils. This location serves good food and drinks as well but if you're in a hurry I'd suggest not planning on Nacho Daddy. Considering all wait time until we received our food was nearly two hours.",

    "text": "Nacho Daddy is Nacho Average Mexican place! I'll start with the delicious freebie you get just for checking in, their House Margarita, oh man is this thing simple and delicious! I'm usually a flavored margarita type of gal but I just decided on a whim to order the house marg, so glad I did. Not only was it a very well balanced drink but I believe they make their own sweet and sour mix so it tastes even better. They're also priced regularly at $8 whereas the flavored margs run you about $11.  Food wise I ordered the Filet Mignon Nachos because I'm fancy and high class hahaha! I'm kidding, they honestly just had the best fixins on top. The waitress was so great, she wasn't a helicopter waitress but was very attentive and flexible with the orders. While in Vegas I was really on a loaded fry kick. So instead of only chips with my nachos I asked for fries and she said yes! They were absolutely delicious, I would load the tortilla chip with the fries and all the fixins and dive right into heaven on Earth! My Wife was torn between two crab and lobster dishes (the nachos or the enchiladas), if you've already seen my pictures you know she chose the enchiladas. They were great and surprisingly enough she ate a good sized portion of them. My Dad (who we brought to Vegas as our personal body guard) ordered the chicken philly with fries. He's not as food adventurous but we're working on it!   Atmosphere was great. Wasn't too crowded or too loud. It was a great place to stop in before going ziplining on Fremont! I highly recommend Nacho Daddy for drinks, food and experience!",

If you are like me, and your favorite thing on Earth is nachos, you come to a place named this with pretty high hopes.  The nachos were \"ok\".    Most notably, anything with chicken was incredibly bland.    It was like shredded unseasoned chicken, and instead of ingredients being distributed throughout the plate, they were all thrown on top, leaving the entire layer underneath with absolutely nothing on them.    Nothing to turn my nose at, but definitely not the expectation I had in my head.  The scene was happening - lots of late nights bar hoppers looking for some grub to soak up the alcohol.    Loud.   Energetic.   It's good for that for sure.      Service was great.   He offered his favorites and was around to check on us.  However, in exchange for the free check in Margarita, I was told twice that the expectation is that I'll write a review.   I've never had that happen before, and it felt a little pressured.   I mean, I was going to do it anyway.   Being told to do it felt a little \"donkey with a carrot in front of his nose\", if you know what I mean.",

Outside there's a hostess or greeter not sure as she was talking on her phone and as we headed in she jumped in front of us to let us know she would seat us.  We were greeted by our server who was a really nice guy.  He was very patient as we finally found things to order as we noticed it's not really a Mexican restaurant, we placed our orders a bit skeptical.  We were seated below two tvs and watched the tv above us on happy tv channel.  The videos were just that they did make you laugh and chat and help the time to pass.  When our order came we were surprised by the portions. They were not skimpy which made up for the price.  The burritos were nice size my son said the meat was a bit over seasoned but still tasty.  The nachos were really delicious.  And unlike other places the guacamole that comes with it is more than enough which was a plus for me.    My daughter had the fire shrimp and it looked amazing she verified that it taste delicious.  The house margarita taste like mix better off ordering a lemonade.  Although this isn't an authentic Mexican restaurant it does hit the spot.",

Scorpion shots, Tamales, burritos, margaritas. All of the delectable Mexican things you want. This is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas so far. I've been back several times. They have 3 locations, I have only been to the one near Fremont. If I had one complaint it would be that it's a little bit off the main path for Fremont, which causes it to miss out on some more fun patio experiences. But the food is great, and the margaritas are strong.",

If you are a vegan then you gotta love this place as they have an extended vegan menu page. Yelp check in gives a free margarita which I didn't use as I'm not a fan of margaritas also didn't feel like drinking. We ordered the vegan loaded nachos to share and it was a perfect size for a share. If you're extremely hungry then you'll also be able to eat this, but we wanted a snack and I was full after eating half. They were really good, not spicy just as I prefer and lots of beans. Some of the better nachos I've had! The place is loud and vibrant, the only thing absolutely disgusting is the bathroom but I think they suffer from Fremont tourists and homeless people using it, as I noticed that when I went in there.",

After dining on August 26th 2019, I have decided I will never return.   I felt awful after eating my super loaded vegan nachos, the ratio of vegan cheese to beans to the rest of the toppings was disproportioned.  I tried to eat my vegan nachos but the preservatives in the pickles jalapenos set my heart racing.  I felt my blood circulation decrease.  The Vegan cheese must be soy based, and it must be a GMO, cause holy guacamole did I feel awful upon ingesting the dish.   I felt my IQ drop as I ate the food and soaked In the atmosphere.  The poor taste in music annoyed me.    Regardless, I was met with super friendly service by Julian, a good peep.  The bartender, Anya maybe? Didn't bother to ask me if I enjoyed the meal, in fact no one did.  I had left behind over 1/2 of my nachos.  No one thanked me for my business, no one offered me water.  I tipped 20% because I am a server myself and am such a nice person, (says it in a Mean Girls tone.)  If you want a good time, social food, practical no fuss kind of stuff, come here.  Don't expect to get a meal of a high caliber, they definitely don't care the origins of the vegetables or meats they use. This place does not suck, you just gotta know what you're getting into, and what that is, is junk food.  To me, junk is not food.    I was super turned off by the types of take out container they provide.  They use the cheapest foam non renewable most BPA ridden containers, how awful.  #whatever  My favorite part of my experience was the free margarita with my check in.",

Jeff immediately noticed my friend and myself, securing us bar seats at the busy establishment and lively bar.  Bartender let us settle into our seats, welcomed us with a smile and menus:) We needed some time in digesting our menu, wonderful options for all!  Yes, even for you vegans they have many choices! Jeff was attentive, came over suggested some cocktail choices and reviewed their menu with us. He was wonderful, I mentioned I have a cilantro allergy and he assured me Nacho Daddy accommodates.  That he would personally follow up with the kitchen.  Our cocktails were quite the generous pouring and the size of the glass- OH MY! Our entrees came out in a flash!  Actually the timing was spot on, those cocktails were well balanced when the fresh and tasty food arrived;) The music and videos at the bar were well suited for the bar- bravo for the one who chose those! Portions are oh so right, as well as the quality and presentation. Atmosphere- energetic. Service- A+++ Credit to the female bartender Friday evening, and of course Jeff!",

The only reason I knocked a star off is because it was a little hot in the restaurant other than that, everything was good. My daughter and her friend enjoyed their chicken kids taco and my friend loved her fiesta nachos. I only got a picture of my food because everyone attacked their plates soon as they were put in front of them. There was a little bit of a wait but not too bad for a Tuesday night. I would come back here if I am on fremont street for sure but since parking is so crazy and fremont is usually packed with tourists, I probably won't come here as often as I would like.   Man, get the shrimp tacos! They're delicious!!!!!",

When we finally got seated, the waitress wasn't all that friendly or patient--but, because I was with my friends, I just went with the flow.   After I checked in yelp, I was afforded a free house Margarita. It was decent--not sweet enough for my liking.   I ordered the enchilada nachos with green sauce and they were AMAZING. Not spicy at all which was a plus for me since I don't like spicy foods.   I rated a 4 because of the service that was given. The food was a 5 though.",

Truly enjoyed my dinner! My SO had the enchilada Nachos and she enjoyed her meal as well!  The wait time was a bit long to be seated and to eat, however it was a Saturday & busy.

    "text": "The last time I was here was over 2 years ago and the review I left wasn't pretty. I decided to give this place another shot and I'm happy I did.  On probably the last decently warm weekend of the summer, before the insane heat hits, we stopped in on a Saturday night. The wait was about 30-45 mins for two. We didn't mind and put our name down, grabbed a drink and people watched for awhile. Instead of sitting at our table, we decided to grab seating at the bar. It's a small venue and honestly, I don't care for their restaurant seating so I didn't mind giving up our table to a larger party.   The bartender passed me a menu and got to work on my margarita, which was good but had salt when I asked for no salt. A minor flaw but noted. We went with the chicken tinga nachos. Kind of skeptical at first, but I'm glad we did. They were killer! Gigantic, flavorful and did not disappoint. The smoky chipotle flavor of the chicken paired well with the richness of the cheese, beans and avocado. The pickled onion was the perfect finish-- a little crisp and tart. J and I are always down to get down, especially after a hardcore gym session, and we could not finish the last bites of these. Note that he is 205 lbs of solid muscle with an appetite to match his gains.   The bill for two of us, even when adding guac on the nachos, was $30 and some change. Daaaaaang. Probably the cheapest evening out for two of us in awhile. Much needed, since we dropped $400 at The Palm (a baller steak and seafood joint in Caesar's Palace) the night before.   I LOVE being able to positively update reviews, especially after boycotting them for years after having a crappy experience. Welcome to the 4 star gang, Nacho Daddy. Glad you guys got it together. We'll be back for more chicken tinga nachos.",

Our server Christin was fantastic.  She kept filling up our drinks and chips.  She recommended my item from the happy hour menu.  She was sweet and cute and just a great personality.  Our bill was $35 with tip which I thought was not bad given the quality of food and awesome service.  If you are concerned with prices, try the happy hour menu...my nachos (which were plenty big) were only $6  I'll be back!",

You must order the endless chips and salsa, it's under three dollars and worth every penny. I've given this place a 4/5 because service was very slow.

Ingredients do not taste fresh and are layered in a way that homogenized all the flavor.  Try not chopping everything into tiny bits.  Their menu offers very few divergent takes on the classic nacho supreme and what they do offer lacks imaginations.",

    "text": "Say what you want about \"I've had better\" nachos\", Nacho Daddy is my default go to downtown, when I don't need to deal with whimsical bars and hipster crowd and I just want a giant plate of delicious food and a margarita.   No, I don't think all the items on their menu are spectacular, I've ordered both BBQ and Thai something nachos and they were meh. BUT, the burrito bowls never disappoint, the spicy shrimp nachos are spectacular and my friend swears by their carnitas.   The house margaritas are delicious and if you wanted to try one of those weird Coke flavors from a fancy machine- they've got that too.    Sit at the bar or in the dining room and you encounter a hilarious mix of mismatched couples on an awkward date, girls of the likes that dance in party pits fresh off their shifts, deer in the headlights tourists, younger crowd having a good time bar hopping,  and an occasional local like myself. Cause. I was downtown and so Nacho Daddy.  They are open later than a lot of other food serving place in DT (short of a casino coffee shops) and there are times of day you can actually park in front of the place, I believe it's before 10pm.   The crowd and the vibe is very all over the place, you never know if there will be a drunk girl throwing up in the bathroom or if someone will slap you on the shoulder and ask about \"what's good here\", but if I didn't like that, I'd live in Henderson.",

We sit down, NO greeting, NO intro, nothing. We ordered; Enchiladas, Mexican Burger, Guac & Chips, and Coronitas (Margarita with Corona tipped in) The Guac & Chips came out, our meal came out shortly after, we didnt get to enjoy our appetizer as an appetizer. The guac & chips were the best part of the meal. Burger & Enchiladas were alright.  Drinks were not good at all! There was no personality in the staff what so ever, the only personable staff member was the bald tattooed guy that brought us our food. The whole time we are eating we didnt get checked up on, we didnt have silverware.  I cant say that I'd come back. If the service was WAY better I'd probly give it another try and try something else on the menu since it did have potential.",

    "text": "Since we were in the area, my friend and I decided to eat here again. This time I tried the Chicken Enchilada Nachos. They sounded like they would be tasty from the menu description. My expectation was that the chicken would be shredded, since that's how it always is in enchiladas. Instead, there were little cubes of dried out chicken. I expected some enchilada sauce to be mixed in with the chicken, but instead the nachos were a wet, greasy mess. Enchilada sauce had been dumped over all of the chips. I ate about a quarter of the food. That was all I could stomach. I ended up having a \"sour\" stomach for nearly three hours after the meal.  My friend had what she always has - the Big Daddy burrito. She loves it. When it came, it was obviously smaller than what it had been in the past. She stated that they must have changed the recipe because it just didn't taste the same. In the past, they always had brought a small plate with sour cream and lettuce on it, too. She asked to speak to the manager who came over after we had completed the meal.  The manager insisted that there hadn't been any change to the recipe and that the burrito had never come with the small plate of lettuce and sour cream. She seemed uninterested in inquiring why most of my food was still on the plate. Eating here really seems to be a crap shoot.",

I went to the restroom to wash my hands and was greeted by cockroaches. The dirty appearance, awful smell, and roaches were plenty of reason to leave. And we did. It's unfortunate. Won't be back.",

They claimed that there was 2 parties coming that would take up all the tables. I felt very suspicious as if they were lying so I called nacho daddy and asked if there was a wait. The man said there was no wait. Then I explained the story and he said let me find out. The manager \"Kelly\" gets on the phone and says yes there's an hour wait because you have a minor with you. That was never said by the hostesses. The manager never said there was a big party coming in either. Not really sure why the manager would lie but never coming here again.",

So I order the \"daddy's house margarita\" which apparently is NOT their house margarita. They bring you a smaller margarita in a jelly jar for the check in offer. I also made the mistake of showing the waiter at the end of our visit so he offered to bring me the mini margarita but since I already Drank two of the others it was a no thank you! So I bought an entree and two full priced margaritas for $40.  The food was good and our group had a fun time. Chicken taco was too spicy for my son but filet nachos were big and tasty.  Once I pointed out that the menu said \"house\" they did take some money off of ur our bill which I appreciated!  Ps they also give a military discount so thank you Daddy!",

The chicken tortilla soup almost had an enchilada-type base-I wish it came with avocado chunks. The quesadilla with chicken had the biggest, most tender chicken-I had to use a knife and fork! I wish it had a spice to it though. The boyfriend got the tostada nachos with white queso. It took all he had to try and finish them. We were STUFFED. I will come back to Nacho Daddy for sure when we come back to Vegas!",

Served in a cast iron skillet the nachos at the bottom remained crisp for each and every bite.  The service was unbelievable.  Our last night in Vegas and we decided to try this Mexican place because of the yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  Reubin the chef came out and had us taste 2 items on the menu we had not tried and my husband had wished he had ordered the Fiesta Nachos.  We couldn't believe the amount of time he spent with us talking.  Brittany our server who was new did an outstanding job.  Thanks to the both for the personal service and making our last night in Vegas memorable.  We will be back next time in Vegas!",

The place can get a little packed, as those annoying trolley pubs have this on their route and dump 20 people off trying to get shots, but it's worth the trip.  The location in Summerlin is definitely nicer, but I like the atmosphere of this place.  If you live downtown, it's a great spot.  They have vegan options on every section of the menu.  My favorite are the vegan nachos!  A real treat.  The guacamole is good to start out with and I recommend asking for the same chips that come with the vegan nachos.  You can't go wrong with the tofu fajitas either.  The portion sizes are absolutely incredible and can easily be shared.    If you're not faint at heart, you can get a tequila shot with a scorpion in it!  Not my thing really, but everyone should try it once.  There is some good merchandise for sale.  Have a scorpion shot and get a shirt that says #gotstung!!!  Like I said earlier, the place can get a little packed, so don't expect to get your food in 5 min like most tex-mex places.  It's worth the wait.",

I was a little nervous showing up with my best friend, who's vegan, and another who's dairy free since it can be hard to figure out where we can all be accommodated. I had no idea there's a whole Vegan section. She ordered the vegan chicken fajitas and loved them.

We basically filled the whole restaurant with about 15 people there for the dinner. It's a super small place. The parking can also be hard to find, but that's everywhere downtown.   I was so excited to try some of their nachos and loved the variety of options like buffalo chicken, BBQ chicken, hamburger and enchilada. I opted to go with the enchilada nachos with green sauce. Overall these bad boys were delicious! I'm glad I made the green sauce choice and the toppings were definitely not sparse. The only thing I didn't care for was how quickly the chips got soggy. I'm not a soggy chip fan so that kind of crushed my spirits.   I would definitely come back again to try some more of their nacho and entree options. Oh and don't forget to check in for a free house margarita!",

    "text": "Vegan nachos review.  I don't eat meat or beans and have a sensitivity to dairy. This totally takes the fun out of eating nachos. I'm a little (or a lot depending on how you eat) picky about my food. The nachos I ordered were not loaded with all of the fixings. The bartender was surprised when they came out. I was happy. She got my order right. Score.  So here's my review:  These were not the best vegan nachos that I have ever had but, I ate them all. In fact, I enjoyed them down to the last few bites. The nachos are more toppings then chips so eliminating th beans made them a lot smaller in portion. The chips are house made and perfectly seasoned although, a little oily. The vegan cheese was creamier than any other vegan nacho cheese that I have tried but, not as thick. I prefer my nacho cheese to be thicker. I don't like raw onions so I ordered them sans pico or the salsa. The salsa was really good and not too oniony. I didn't touch the pico de gallo. Overall, I enjoyed this greasy treat. I wish there was a little more cheese. I was in awe looking over at other people's orders. The ones with all the fixings are a sight to see and look delicious.  Now for experience. I sat at the bar. The bartender wasn't the most friendly but, she was efficient. I was not put off by her attitude but, could tell that other customers didn't quite understand her vibe. Still, she did her job and earned her 20% tip from me. So the big question is would I go back? Absolutely! This is a heaven for nacho lovers and I'd love to try the different versions when I am feeling adventurous.",

Stellar service from fab staff, great drinks, and - just being honest as I've not eaten much here yet - my friends find it to be tasty food. The menu is abbreviated from the Henderson location, but the offerings are still classic Nacho Daddy with, I think, some new surprises?   I dare say I prefer this location; the layout is cozy and more conducive to socializing,  it's warmer and more welcoming, and, hey, you're downtown! Aaaand, the open garage-style windows = a form of my beloved al fresco #patiolife! 70* on a January day? Perfect!  Looking forward to checking it out more often!  PS, the music is nicely mixed and I've yet to hear (a) the same palsy on repeat, or (b) a bad song.  Poppy, alt rock, Top 100, and others mixed in. A bit of stuff for all.",

    "text": "It was a morbidly cold night on a Wednesday, with wind chill it was probably 40 degrees. Which absolutely disrespected the shit out of my unprepared Southern California clothing.   My comrade and self decided so seek shelter in a place called nacho daddy. We parked our steeds outside and approached the two far end seats of the bar \"it was near empty in there\". I started off as any self respecting male would. With a water on the rocks \"of which I was heckled for by the bartender, but I didn't care because I was parched of my vast travels of the sema auto show.\" Anyway, After looking at my menu for all of 37.4 seconds I knew the tostada nachos were the meal to warm my near lifeless body. The friendly female bartender had enough of my shenanigans after I placed my order and slid me a Miller lite across the bar and said drink up. Little did I know this Miller would be the beginning of the end. As I finished my beer my comrade decided the remainder of the night would be spent with shots. \"Jameson and pickle juice\". After several shots \"more like 7\" along with everything else I had pre gamed with at a city called New York New York. Where we traded beads to a man in a type of chair with wheels and no legs in to get directions. l knew I had fucked up. The nachos were transported from the kitchen to the bar in a backhoe that somehow they made fit in such a tiny spot. I'm not a big person by any means so these nachos made my hand look like that little person from Austin powers. I didn't know how to attack this battle without making a huge mess or drawing attention to myself. I somehow managed to rig myself a harness from napkins and straws to suspend myself from the ceiling as to not make a mess on myself.   Lol now that you've probably read the majority of this review I'll take a second to actually say the bartender was attentive, friendly/assholeish \"in a good way\" and the food runners were awesome as well. I recommend sharing the mound of happiness they call food with the duggar family because I barely made a dent in it. I've been to this location several times, they never give me a reason to not come back. The company was better on Fremont, as opposed to the overpriced hooker sitting  next to me at the bar blowing her second hand dick smoke in my face.",

Thank you, Yelpers for leading us to Nacho Daddy, right off the beaten Fremont Street Experience path.  I'm kind of wavering between 3 & 4 stars here, service was lacking, but the food was good.   The place feels a little divided, with the bar & bar dining on the other side of the wall from a more open, \"brunchy\" feeling dining area. We sat away from the bar but I wish we hadn't, it was much livelier over there!  The menu offers tacos, burritos, chips, guac... I honestly didn't look over it too long because we found what we wanted right away. We split the guacamole, chicken street tacos and pork burrito. Everything was very tasty and reasonably priced.  Our server was a bit inattentive, forgetting things here and there, taking awhile on the drinks, etc. We weren't in a big hurry though so it wasn't a huge deal.  Glad we stopped by!",

They had most of the out of town games on, so I got to watch my Jets lose by 40 to a team from Ohio (boo). Sunny day? Gotta grab a Pacifico on tap and a Daddy's Supreme Taco (carne asada, mozz, roasted salsa and cilantro). This was a bomb-a$$ taco and was really like a smedium 'rito. A thicker than normal tortilla allowed all the toppings to stay right in place, so no leaking from any end and no breakage in the middle. The lunchtime price of $8.95 didn't break the bank and the whole bill (2 beers, 1 shot, taco, chips) came out around $20. Not too bad. Will def be back!  Pro-tip: Don't ask what kind of tequilas they have unless you have a while. There are lots.",

It is located in the center of the downtown Freemont area which basically means pay to park fees, must walk a distance from parking garage to restaurant (that pretty much looks beat down and dingy) This place is good for anyone who is already walking down the downtown Freemont area. Not, for someone to drive specifically to this place. It is not worth The hassle of just getting there. Anyways. The drinks were amazing!!! So. If you are someone already in the area, it's a great place to have drinks and appetizers. Our waitress was amazing. Good customer service. It has a (dingy) run down (old distressed counter tables throughout) casual late afternoon \"grab drinks and appetizer\" in any type of attire vibe for someone already in the area.",

    "text": "Personally, I like their food. My bf hates it, says it makes him sick, unfortunately. My rating is based on the service alone. Dear god, it's TERRIBLE. Now - I can't speak on the table service, since we sat at the bar on both our visits, but they seriously need to work on hiring better bartenders! The first visit wasn't terrible, but the second visit was just awful. We actually heard our bartender (don't know her name but she had that ratchet red color hair), asking the tall male bartender to take our order cause she didn't want to. Um, really? Once he refused, she came by to take our order. I asked if they had filtered water, she said she had no idea. Um, how about asking another bartender??? Then, I ordered the chick'n chimichanga, & my bf ordered tacos. One min later she comes back & asks again what my bf ordered. When the food arrived, they got his order right but gave me a veggie burrito. I told her, & she apologized & put the right order in. No biggie. I know people can have bad days or maybe she's new? 20 min later (after my bf finished his meal) my order comes out. Very much worth the wait, delicious; albeit annoying that we couldn't eat together. One thing I noticed though (while waiting almost an hour for my food), is that this wasn't a very busy night, there were 3 couples at the bar including my bf & myself, & the dining area wasn't that busy either. So I was really confused as to why on both of our visits, the bartenders literally went out of their way to not wait on us. There were 3 bartenders, & they spent the majority of our visit having conversations like they were on break? MAYBE if our bartender actually put all of her focus & effort into her JOB instead of goofing off with the other bartenders, she wouldn't screw up so much? I appreciate her apology, but you could tell it didn't really matter to her cause she probably does it 100x a day. Once I finished my meal, I asked for a dessert to go. And of course, once again, she screws up my order. They bring out a vegan quesadilla??? Wtf? When they tell her she screwed up, she & all the bartenders were just laughing about it. She actually came over to me & blamed it on the WAITER even though SHE put it in the system wrong, SMH. At that point, I yelled out \"HEY I'll take the quesadilla for all the inconvenience?!\" LOL By the time they brought out the dessert I thought for SURE she would take it off the bill, but no. LOL My bf said \"this is the laziest, most careless bartender I've ever seen.\" I don't even think she was new, I think she was on pills tbh. All I have to say is - the next time we'll be sitting at a TABLE. I'm sure the bartenders will be happy to hear this since they CLEARLY hate their jobs. LOL",

We also ordered a michelada and a blackberry margarita. The michelada was decent (I'm half Mexican, so standards are high) but the margarita was soooooooooo sweet. I couldn't drink it to save my life. My husband ended up drinking it because \"he doesn't waste liquor\". Lol.  We would def come back again and try a different item. #nachosforlife",

    "text": "Catchy name reeled my friends and I into this restaurant.  Just happened to be in Downtown on a sardine packed can of people kind of night. Decided to give this place a try. It's hidden a little bit off of the Downtown Vegas path. Dark on the outside a little hard to tell where to enter. We found it and were greeted and quickly seated. It was busy, so the servers were running around trying to keep everyone happy.   Got our drinks ordered, and asked our server for recommendations.  He told us to get one of Nacho choices and the 2 most expensive were their most popular ;).   Thanks to checking in with Yelp I got a free margarita, although in retrospect, I think it was virgin, because it just tasted like mix, no scent or taste of liquor.   The food arrived in the expected amount of time. I got the Enchilada (chicken) Nachos. The portion was big, more than enough for two people. All of my buddies also got big servings and soon we would all be full, and feel like adjusting our belts to a more forgiving notch.   The service was good. Like most places in Vegas the restaurant itself had dark floors that were a little sticky. The food was good and plentiful. Considering bang for the buck and without a 30 minute wait on Presidents' Day weekend we were satisfied.  If the buffet you wanted just can't be had or just looking for a quick meal, this is a good spot to fill the void.",

    "text": "Nacho combinations were interesting and delicious but all lacked cheese. I had the classic and chicken tinga. Chicken was tender and flavorful. Really great taste. I sat at the bar and the service from the bartender was limited, the bar back was great though. I got the free margarita for checking in on YELP and it was terrible. Mostly bitters. Had to Ofer a second shot of tequila to make it drinkable. Ordered the pineapple mint margarita after that and it was the same. Mostly bitters barely a hint of artificial pineapple flavor and a couple of mint leaves for looks I guess. They were muddled and delivered no flavor. This place was on my bucket list for Vegas and I am glad I tried it but I wouldn't recommend it.",

I got the Filet Mignon nachos, and while the price might scare some people, it was totally worth it. Usually place load you up with crappy chips and tons of   store bought salsa, but not here. They loaded it up with tons of fresh, real home made salsa, tons of meat and fresh chips, and cheese.  The service was great as well. Our server was on top of things, checking up with us, bringing out food out quick and getting our drinks refilled before we could even ask.   You can tell that they have been doing this for a while and perfecting it along the way. I would highly recommend stopping by here if you're ever visiting downtown vegas!",

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and we were happily greeted by Ariel and later the AGM Joseph came over to check up on our drinks. We decided to be spontaneous and order a mango margarita pitcher. It was delicious and well worth the money for sure. We easily got 5-6 drinks out of our pitcher. I ordered the ceviche and my boyfriend ordered the American tacos. Both orders came out in a punctual, timely matter and was well prepared. Food was fresh and very tasteful, especially for late 1am. We left Nacho Daddy very satisfied and super happy with the great food and exceptional customer service. Highly recommend for anyone in the area!",

    "text": "We went a while back and I wasn't sure what to say about our experience. While the food was good it wasn't worth the trouble.  We came up to check in and were quoted a 50 minute wait. No biggie...from all of the great things my husband had read we figured it would be worth the wait. My husband had literally been talking about Nacho Daddy before we even got to Las Vegas.  Shortly after we checked in a flood of people also checked in. Really. So. Many. People. Multiple small and large parties. Great I thought! It's going to be AMAZING! 40 minutes goes by and I'm pretty annoyed because ALL those people were sat before us. But whatever we were quoted 50 minutes. Then 50 minutes goes by.. an hour.. so we check in again with the hostess. She informed us that she was waiting for a larger table to seat us since we needed a high chair. Okay fine. We finally get seated an hour and a half after we checked in and we were seated at two tables pushed together. One table so wobbly they had to overlap it with the other table to sort of stabilize it but it would slowly inch apart and be wobbly again. The hostess said the manager would be over to fix it. He or she never showed. I was literally seated between the two tables and couldn't even keep my plate level.  We waited a good while before a waiter and a trainee come to ask about what we'd like to drink. We order drinks and appetizers and then wait even longer to order food than we did to order drinks.  Our queso came out wrong (we asked for the toppings on the side) so it had to be remade.  The food eventually came and it was good but didn't really satisfy us after such a sour customer service experience.  Then it took forever to get a check and leave.   Overall I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "How disappointing all I can do is shake my head... we are huge fans of the Nacho Daddy location in Henderson they do an absolute amazing job and it's one of our favorite places. Therefore we thought going downtown it would be even better we were wrong. Let me preface this review by advising management not need contacting me to make the situation better as addressing my concerns should been done at the restaurant. Unfortunately we had Ryan as a server who tended more to the smaller brunette Hostess then his tables along with our table. We were unattended for so long when it was not even busy that we went to the bar to get a drink. Since we already had a table the bartender with the dreads assumed that I would not tip her because I was not sitting at the bar so I was giving an attitude about ordering a drink from her. Lucky for her I'm a decent human being and I understand that this is a service industry and tips need to be given as I was a bartender for four years. After convincing the bartender she can give me a separate check for the drink I went back to the table and watched Ryan from afar at the hostess stand. In the end I see there is a lack of management at the restaurants as if a manager was on the floor they would notice the lack of activity from their server. Training also needs to be established you should call the Henderson Property and see how they handle their staff then maybe you wouldn't get a review like this.",

We finished the drinks and food and wanted more drinks, but when we tried to get the bartenders attention he completely ignored us.  Sat there for over 20 minutes without anyone coming to get another drink order.  We even pushed our empty glasses and plate in his direction and still ignored us.  Politely shouted over the music and raised our hand, still ignored.  Awful awful awful service but it wasn't just to us, three groups on our side of the bar all experienced the same thing.  Maybe the bartender just wanted to keep serving the dude who he fist pumped since he got two rounds before anyone came our way.",

Out initial drink order took a bit, kinda weird since there were not that many people there to begin with, but after our first rounds of drinks our nachos came out cold as if they sat in the window for a bit. By then the place got a little busier but even other tables were still trying to put in drinks orders. Maybe something is wrong with the front of the house as well as the back of the house. Our food came out cold as well. Not good. By the time we left our we had been waiting on drinks for about 10 minutes, but the food runner was big plus since he helped refill some of our drinks. Overall, not coming back and not recommending.",

    "text": "Working downtown gives me the luxury of bountiful options for happy hour.  So when a Tuesday night craving randomly arose, I decided to choose a place close to my job that offered a little bit of happy hour libations and good grub. Since they've opened, I've visited Nacho Daddy a few times. For someone who hasn't really put Mexican cuisine at the top of their list, they must be doing something right for me to continue coming back!  As successful as the Anthem location was, Nacho Daddy decided to open up shop last year in Downtown Las Vegas. This semi-hole in the wall gem of a cantina is located on 4th St., between Stewart Ave. and The Fremont Street Experience.  If you get lost, just look for the bright red and yellow neon sign accompanied with a Nacho chip man dressed in a Sombrero.  When you enter in the restaurant, you'll notice a few focal points. The first thing I noticed the partition separating the restaurant from the bar. Covered with pictures of various tequila brands, the partition really holds True to the type of restaurant this is.  There were also two garage style rolling doors offering a lot of fresh air ventilation which I appreciated on this warm evening.    Entering the full service bar, I immediately noticed the square bar top that took up almost the entire space.  Big screen TVs and projectors allowed me to watch multiple games and networks.  On my visit, Tyrone and Rick were the bartenders helping me out.  Tyrone was the one who actually took my order and stood out to me the most.  He was not only easy to talk to, but super attentive and really took the time to show me I was a valued customer.  Now that's customer service!  The partitions made me realize that margaritas were definitely in order! Call me a lush, but since this was also an important review, I thought it was only fair to try an array of flavors! So here's the deal: their margaritas run anywhere from $8-$11 depending on the flavor.  All margaritas are served in a cool mason jar and garnished with a lime wedge and salted rims. On my visit I wanted to stick to one brand of tequila, so I chose the Sauza Hornitos Plata for its spicy taste and agave origins. Here's what I got:  Blackberry Acai Margarita for $10: Acai liqueur, muddle blackberries, agave nectar and homemade sweet and sour.  This drink was a bit too tart. You can definitely taste the sweet and sour flavor with a hint of the agave but the stars of the show were the blackberry and acai.  Chunks of blackberry offered a nice textured pulp and the sweetness of the acai balanced some of the tart flavor.     White Peach Margarita for $9: White peach liqueur and puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  What I loved about this one was that it was a lot sweeter.  Sometimes sweet and sour can get a little to tart but this drink was subtle and full of flavor.  Like sitting on the banks of Georgia!  Guava Margarita for $9: Orchid guava liqueur, guava puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour.  This margarita was set up exactly like the white peach. Full bodied from the puree, the guava nectar really shined through.  I felt like I was on the beach in Waikiki!  Mango Thai Basil Margarita for $10: Thai basil, agave nectar, Mango Schnapps, mango puree, fresh lime juice and sweet and sour. I was pleasantly surprise about this one. On one hand you have the fragrant taste of a mango.  On the other, you're hit with a hint of the basil herb, breaking up the sweetness in an awesome kind of way.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this eclectic drink!  After trying all of these amazing libations, I needed something to balance it out. Remember folks, Nacho Daddy serves food! Tyrone was nice enough to suggest the Taco Tuesday deal: 3 mix and match tacos for $3.33. I was at the point of no return. I had to take advantage of that and I'm sure glad I did. Like the margaritas, the tacos are well prepared, well-seasoned and ultimately well received. I got the pork taco, stuffed with cheese, the chicken taco stuffed with onions and cilantro and the breaded shrimp taco stuffed with cabbage, cheese and pico.  All were super flavorful, filled with the protein and delicious!  When it's all said and done, I will rave about this place for a long time to come. I'm a huge fan of local businesses opening downtown.  This place has truly brought their success in Anthem, to the heart of Las Vegas. Whether you're in the mood for a happy hour drink, late night libation or even a brunch brewski, make your way to this awesome place, Nacho Daddy!",

    "text": "I need to compliment the management at Nacho Daddy.   My friends and I walked in to have breakfast at 9am after the Color Run. The restaurant was basically empty. We ordered about 5 minutes into arriving. The server was not ready, willing, or cordial from the moment we walked in. I ordered a coffee and my friends ordered breakfast. She said she would be able to make my coffee, but not right away. She would later just forget (thank god for the manager who came over and made it for her). After ordering, the restaurant filled up with runners from the Color Run.   As service slowed to a crawl, our food came out. Well, only some of it. And it was the wrong order. 30 minutes later, our order still was not complete. 40 minutes had passed, we gave up and we asked for our check. The server eventually got us our check but charged us twice for the food we never got. After correcting that mistake, she failed to give us back our credit card. It was time to leave to avoid more and more errors. After a morning of below average service, we left.   Here is the good part. As this was rare service from this location, I went back later to discuss it with the area manager. She was very apologetic and kind. She wanted us to return and make up for the errors from that morning. She said she would discuss the problem with the server and see if there was a systems failure during breakfast times.   I appreciated the proactive nature of the area manager. Serving can be a tough job and some days are better than others. While our experience was below average, it was corrected by a manger willing to listen and correct the errors.   Thank you Nacho Daddy for responding to customers needs!",

    "text": "Ok Nacho Daddy Downtown, you have redeemed yourself. I'm back to being a believer! In NACHO DADDY, I BELIEVE! haha...no really Jennifer, Tyrone and Rick took excellent care from before me stepping in to the place. The service was overly on point, and not just with me and my guest, but with everyone. I had the Mango Thai Basil Margarita and the Raspberry Margarita (Tyrone's suggestion) and both were the bomb. We partook in the Supreme Nachos sin jalapenos (I can't do spicy) and they were delicious. The guest I took rarely ate and in fact prior to eating said he'd just have \"a lil sum sum\"? He ate most of it because it was so good. Rick was very attentive to his bar guests and Tyrone was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Thank you again for the great service, delicious drinks, and scrumptious food. I'll be seeing you again.",

Both bartenders were polite but no very attentive, we had to flag them down for water multiple times and there was only 4 other people st the bar.  We sent back our fajitas, they were cold, fajitas are supposed to come out sizzling and there was zero heat. They reheated it instead of making a new one, which was ok I guess but they still had no steam whatsoever.  We were hungry and didn't want to be annoying so we ate them. I won't go to this location again but I will to another because the food (besides fajitas) was great.",

I would of given it a 1 star had the salsa not been so good. I wish I would've just had a drink and chips and salsa. Then I would've left a very positive review. But me and my wife both felt horrible the remaining of the day also. Just kind of recurring burps of the food all night. I didn't want to eat my burrito, but at $15 for the burrito, I ate it anyways. I would've rather eaten at chipolte. It ended up being worse for my wife. She spent all day on the toilet and puking. Then off to urgent care. Food poisoning is considered the most likely cause. I felt pretty bad after eating there but at least I wasn't doing as bad as her. $70 later for a crappy dinner and kind of ruining our trip to vegas. 1 star now. Only because they don't have negative star ratings.",

This definitely looks like a place for late night boozing. Attractive, young waitstaff and 90's 'nostalgia' music that I clearly remember as a full grown adult. Nothing will make you feel your age faster than nostalgia that you're too old to care about. The drinks section takes up half their menu. Bar food makes up the rest. We got the nachos because it's in the name so you'd think they'd be good. They were pricey but plentiful. This is a good place to go if you've got expendable income and you would rather blow it on a night out with friends instead of something sensible like video poker. Not my kind of thing but I'm not their audience. If you want to spend your paycheck on shots of tequila and tortilla chips then you might love it.",

I ordered the vegan street tacos off of the happy hour menu. They came with tofu, black beans, cilantro, corn, hot salsa, guacamole, cabbage, and corn salsa. I was so hungry by the time the food came (my fault, there aren't many vegan restaurants in vegas!) That I happily ate the tacos. After we had already paid (not looking for anything free here) I mentioned to our bartender that most of the ingredients were missing, so she could bring it up to the kitchen. Again, because I work in the restaurant industry it was more of a tip than a complaint, because the next customer might not be so happy if this were to happen to them. When I went into the restroom, I overheard the server complaining about me in detail to someone else. I can't believe how incredibly rude and unprofessional this kind of behavior is and because of this I want to urge others not to go here because of how Allie acted.",

I really like the medley of red onion, tomatoes, and jalapeno that was diced perfectly atop nachos that were kissed with fresh beans, cheese,  and seasoned ground beef. Our server, Brendan was a bearded lil cutie who was very nice and took care of business. I noticed several people taking shots with baby scorpions in them (which is a specialty of some sort there).

There look to be some awesome nacho platters.  I had their enchiladas one day and those were good, and tacos another day that were also pretty decent.  The fajitas both looked and smelled awesome when I saw them.  One person in my party had a burger that looked good.    The atmosphere is pretty standard for a decent sports bar.  Family area to keep the kids away, large bar area with tables.  There are quite a few great beers on tap and they also make some unique blends with the beers as well.  So far this sounds like a 3 and 1/2 to 4 star review, I know.  But this staff took care of me during a recent stay while my mom was in the hospital up the street.  I was staying the night at the hospital and these guys knew my name, knew my drink, and offered their best.  They also let me hang out by outlets a couple of days to charge up my laptop, phone, etc.  The staff here is definitely second to none.    There IS better Mexican in the area, but I haven't found an all out better bar.  It's also nice to have somewhere non smoking in Vegas to hang out in.  Go enjoy!",

However, this spot does delivers on what it promises: decent Mexican food and great drinks in a fun atmosphere.   The restaurant is pretty small, a fully stocked bar sits across from a stage next to a separate dining room. Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh.   Service was pretty friendly on our visit though the bartenders seemed to be slacking on the drinks. Our margaritas were too sweet and they weren't that generous with the tequila. Though I'm not opposed to future visits, they are more worthy places in DTLV.",

So I changed it. During our meal, my friend ended finding a long blonde hair in his food. We immediately stopped eating. And his food was taken off but the manager didn't even offer us a discount despite what we saw and she even saw that we were disgusted with our food. Never going back again.",

Service was fast and friendly and the food was amazing. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Nachos and my wife had the veggie burrito.  The Buffalo Chicken Nachos were absolutely out of this world. I tried my wife's burrito, but I had already tasted the nachos, so I was definitely grading on the curve at that point. My wife loved the burrito, so overall it was a win-win.  Our server was very \"on top of it\" during our entire meal. Checking in on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. We even got a table-side visit from Anthony, the manager who wanted to make sure we were having a good time.   Overall, it was a great dining experience. I left with a full, happy belly and have been dreaming of going back for more Buffalo Chicken Nachos for the last week.",

It is not often you can find vegan (not vegetarian) nachos and even harder to find excellent vegan nachos. These nachos are fantastic. Even a non-vegan would love this dish.

I got the chiliquilles. It came with eggs, tortilla chips, sauce, chicken, pico, beans and rice. And guacamole! Yay! The only thing that's missing was a crunch factor. The whole main dish plus the beans just makes the whole thing soggy, but that's the nature of this dish anyways so I'm not too mad. My boyfriend got the loco mock nachos. It was really good. Everything was really filling though. We were straight up so full after we left. And we were going to explore DTLV so we didn't want to carry take out boxes with us. So if you're going, it's good enough to take back home.   The atmosphere was great. The servers were really nice. The food came out relatively quick. The music was a little out of concept but it's fine. It looks like they have really good drinks, wish I tried some but it was 10am and I couldn't haha. This is more of a lunch/dinner place, but it is good for breakfast. I only found parking in the street right in front of the place, and there was no one so it was easy for me to park. I don't know about busy hours.  Would I come here again? Sure why not",

It was on 4th street right at Fremont. Very convenient after we zip-lined and needed something to fill our belly's. The margaritas were good as well. Big portions! Honestly my friend and I could have split fajitas or nachos but we couldn't compromise so we ordered separately.",

And it's obvious by the how busy is was on a Thursday at 3pm when we showed up for a late lunch. I was initially drawn in by the substantial vegan menu. Vegan queso is no joke and it is very hard to find. Like an Asian Crested Ibis, it is a rare bird. Guys... they have vegan queso! I rest my case (my case-o?).  But, don't worry, meat-eaters, they have plenty for you too! And a wide variety, I might add. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster and Crab Nachos that were served on a large sheet tray. Those bad boys were not messing around.   The margaritas were lovely. The service was nice. And I really appreciate the garage-door style window that was opened to bring in some fresh air and allow us to people-watch the passersby. I can't wait to go to Vegas again to get my Nacho on!",

My choice for dinner was Enchilada Nachos.  This dish was made up of refried beans w tender and juicy chicken breast, jalapenos, sour cream,salsa(red or green) and crispy tortilla chips. Let me tell you, the green salsa had a spicy bold flavor that just seeped into every bite of this dish and made it ohhh sooo good! The serving size could easily feed 2 people but did l share???...Hell No! I cleaned that plate with ease.   A friend had the ground beef enchilada dinner with rice and beans and she had no complaints. Street tacos along with chips, salsa and hot queso were amongst other dishes at our table and all were equally delicious.  Liquor was good. Try the scorpion shot or the buttery nipple. You won't be dissapointed.   * l was so excited and perhaps a little liquored up, l forgot on both visits to take a picture of the nachos! Lol  Will l return, absolutely..l returned the very next day!",

Meaty with great flavor. The triple dip offered cheese, guacamole and salsa. So tasty. We also had the sizzling shrimp which was good but not my favorite if the meal. Friendly service and quick response even though they were pretty busy. Next time I'd probably try the fajitas cause they looked amazing coming out of the kitchen.",

We sat there for a good 10-15 min before anyone came to take our drink order. They sat us by the door which was freezing. There were 3 homeless people who hung outside the place and one came in to ask for money and cigarettes!! We finally moved to the bar when no one was still coming over. We got street tacos which were good and the bartender was nice. But I definitely didn't want to have my date sitting at the bar top. I give 3 stars because the food was good. We haven't been back since though.",

Beer was cold, free Yelp coupon Margarita was very, very good. They make their own margarita mix which was a nice balance of sweet and sour.  Food was just ok. No free chips and salsa, have to pay for those. The crispy taco shell was not homemade, a little stale. We were charged an extra $1 for a small dish of salsa because the meal came with about 2 tablespoons of salsa. The chicken enchilada nachos were so-so, could have been better. Lots and lots of shredded chicken and enchilada sauce on chips but not much cheese or anything else. We live in the Central Valley of California where Mexican restaurants abound and our expectations are pretty high. I'd go back for a drink but can't recommend the food.",

Our server, MARK, made the experience unlike any other. He was energetic, friendly, and passionate about his work! When we first ordered margaritas, we asked for them blended, but they came on the rocks. Before we could take a sip, he pulled them and made sure they returned blended.  Our food (Mexican Corn on the Cob, Spicy Shrimp Nachos, and Filet Mignon Nachos) was excellent. What pushed it over the edge, however, was the option of Vegan cheese and sour cream. I am lactose intolerant, so having these options made a world of difference when enjoying nachos. Definitely coming back here next time we're in town!",

The manager, Joseph or something, said they have a cockroach issue because of the building next door and are working on it. Which is cool, but the  restaurant doors should never have been open if the issue wasn't fixed. He then went on to call my table a bunch of bullshiters.  We tried to show him the pics of the cockroach, but he refused to look or care. He said we didn't see it while eating so it shouldn't be an issue. We then went on to wait 30 mins for or check and they NEVER even tried to find or kill the COCKROACH that we saw. The food was in large portions but nothing special.  Will not be going back disgusted by the management and their upkeep. Save your money go to Denny's across the street",

Once she seated us our server came to our table 10 minutes after to offer drinks (by now I had realized the service was not going to be the best so I started timing) 14 minutes in, our drinks came, 1 mojito(not refreshing at all as it should be) and 1 modelo ( it was warm, our server did say they currently didn't have any cold ones. If you know what you're doing as a server, you walk back to the table and mention it to your customer and maybe offer a different kind of beer before serving a hot beer). We ordered our food 40 minutes in. Again, it took a very, very long time for our food to come out.   The fajitas were pretty delicious but my order of crab and lobster enchiladas were bland, not much  flavor, definitely a rip off of $17. I ended the night by ordering a michelada, michelada was just okay. I definitely won't be back or at least to this location. Service sucks!",

It turned out to be less than 10 minutes until we got a table, which was awesome.  The food was delicious. We got the four cheese nachos, the vegan spicy burrito, chicken fajitas, and fish tacos. Everything was perfect and the vegan menu is just awesome + the service was good too! We'll absolutely be back.",

My friends got carne nachos and ceviche. They said both were a bit spicy but good. Overall it was good food but a ridiculous wait.  ETA: Kayla was not a very good server.

Came upon a bunch of people waiting outside and they were polite enough to tell us they were just hanging out and not standing in line and to go ahead. I see 2 ladies at a podium type table talking story. I ask them is there a wait to get in and they say yup. I look inside and notice there's seats at the bar since its just me & the hubby so i ask can we go to the bar and they say yeah. Im like, well they couldve told us that when i asked if there was a wait. Whatever, we go in find 2 seats and sit. There's 2 people behind the bar who are busy walking back & forth but took a good 10 min. to acknowledge that we were there. Finally, the lady asks us what we want and i order the 2 scorpion shots. It was $20 a shot which i was ok with. From reviews i read prior to coming i knew it was a bit pricey but hey anything for a IG pic, lol. The shot was fine and we even got to keep the shot glass which was nice. My 3 stars is because of the customer service. I get it, it's a bar but it never hurts to be nice to the customers.",

We stopped here with our friends while on Fremont and enjoyed some nachos and a ridiculously delayed burrito. Everything was tasty but the service was absolute trash. From the hostess who scoffed at the request for a group of 6 to the pathetic manager who arrived 60min too late and tried to comp a burrito trying to excuse total neglect of a table who spent over $200.  I can't honestly suggest this restaurant after what we went through; the only reason we stuck around to pay for our tab after an hour or absentee waiters was because we all have experience in the service industry. But no person amongst this staff deserves a dollar of our tips nor our empty thanks for the experience we endured.  Kudos to the kitchen staff for dishing our some tasty nachos.",

The establishment itself is very cute and nicely decorated. Its located in a side street of downtown Las Vegas so it was a bit quieter than the other places we walked by on the main Street.   We ordered the Supreme Tostada Nachos and the Fiesta Nachos. They were born equally delicious!! We also had their peach sangrai which was amazing. It had the perfect amount of alcohol where it is strong enough, but does not have the alcohol taste.   We also ordered the fried ice cream for dessert, but it was not the greatest. However it was almost closing time, so that could've been why. The ice cream crust tasted a little stale. We told our waiter and they were nice enough to replace with the churros, free of charge.   Overall we had a great experience. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend! I wish they would open locations on the East Coast. :(",

Our waitress was not friendly at all. We had to ask 3x for water, she was not very friendly at all. Had to ask a couple times for more napkins,  and had to flag her down to get her attention to get more drinks.  She only became friendly when it was time to pay the bill and tip. I suggest sitting at the stools around the bar if you can. Our 2 great experiences were when we sat at the bar.  Both times the server was busy but friendly and telling us she would be back to us in a minute and engaging with us during our visit.  Thank you bartenders at Nacho Daddy's  !!",

Skip the wings tho lacked anything that would make wings good! My biggest complaint was my waitress, blond never got her name and barely had her attention the entire time! Don't ask her for anything she gives you this smile with I don't really don't wanna be here or talking to you look... I ordered a traditional margarita took a few drinks hated it but hey I ordered it I'll finish it, but as I continued to drink it I noticed that I had the dirtiest glass Ive ever drank out of... Showed my husband he said it has to be stained I took my finger and wiped the glass it was filthy it was disgusting! Did the manger care?!? Oh no she didn't... Said would you like another I said no and she never apologized she did agree it was dirty but the way she acted it was like normal... I'll never go back to that location... Not a good way to send off guest! Customer service wouldn't have gotten any stars but the nachos were bomb!!",

I say most of our orders as I did not get my order at all! The server/bartender just offered a lot of eye rolling and threw a lot of shade but never gave an apology, no I'm sorry, nothing but attitude. Everyone had separate checks and everyone prepaid and she made bank on the tips. I will never make that mistake again. She didn't deserve a penny! So at 1:40PM as I was getting my refund she rudely told me \"I'm also going to cancel that order in the kitchen\" like I was fishing for a comp'd meal! So rude, so slow, so bad, so long Nacho Daddy! Your service is in need of retooling and maybe a staff that cares.  Update: manager contacted me just to get clarification on what happened then abandoned all contact with me. Once again I was let down and nothing was done to make things right. I am no longer surprised that the service was lacking as the manager had no follow through.",

So my girlfriend is very unhappy with either one of the orders of make-shift vegetarian tacos she's had, but she loves their margaritas. One thing I will say is, there's a difference in having good service and then too much service, both times I felt like I had 6 people waiting on me, I constantly had people talking to me and felt I never had second to actually enjoy my food. Also, their whole delivery system for chips and salsa is terrible. They start by asking you which salsa I want as if I knew my options, so I ask for all at once so I can decide. Then they give you a basket of chips with these tiny little, smaller then a shotglass, cups of salsa. The chip barely fits in the cup. You kinda have to pick up the cup and pour the salsa on each individual chip. It's bananas. Has this nacho daddy character never been to a  Mexican restaurant? What is he trying to prove? They all taste great but it's almost too much work to enjoy. Last but not least, this place is a coke establishment, which is always a plus for me!",

The bartenders and servers were nothing but helpful. I was a little bummed that the nacho selection was missing some of my favorites (Enchilada Nachos), but overall the food was on point and the service was perfect. The girl with the treestar tattoo rocked!.",

I sampled the Ceviche first: Love their house made white corn nacho chips which complement the lime, lemon, orange marinated shrimp, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, serrano chilies and avocado perfectly! Next I had the Street Tacos, three house made tacos each filled with asada steak, chicken and babacoa pulled pork, flavored with cilentro, onion and cumin. The pulled pork taco was the winner of the three, topped off with a tomatillo salsa and cotija cheese, Yummy! My friend ordered the Daddys Big Burrito with asada steak and all the trimmings, it was big enough for two people, but he rose to the challenge and devoured it all! Nacho Daddy has a great selection of domestic and imported beers, great cocktails and very special shot aptly called the Scorpion Shot, with a real scorpion in the glass, I had to have it, being a Scorpion myself! All in all a good meal in cool, relaxing surroundings. Great staff, especially Nichole, Christian and Will, who were all very accommodating and knowledgeable. Looking forward to checking out the breakfast menu and vegan section also!",

I enjoyed the Henderson location, and being a downtown denizen, I expected to love this location, which I do....sometimes. I say meh because this place is literally hit or miss. I've had times when I can barely touch the food they give me, and three times when I'm scarfing it down like Gabriel Iglesias on taco Tuesday. This applies to both food and the drinks. There are some bartenders that if I see working I immediately know that I need to stick to my cervezas since they can't mess that up. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great. It's just workable, I'd just like consistency. The Henderson location has always been pretty good, I've heard good things about summerlin, and I liked nacho daddy when they had a booth at LIB.

Thanks Mark M. :)  The food, I'd give 3.5 stars. It's was fresh, but lacked a little on taste. I got the enchiladas, and the green sauce was barely present. I like my enchiladas pretty saucy.  But they had enough sour cream and sides to keep it from being too dry.  The Daddy's Margarita was pretty tasty though.  There are better places for Mexican food in town.

I take my nacho eating very seriously: OK....All cliches and dorky phrases aside, I'm impressed with the creatively thought out twists to simple food.  The good:   *Super cozy atmosphere reminiscent of local Seattle pubs I'm used to. Cute decor includes separate bar and dining areas. Small retail items such as t-shirts for sale a smart idea for tourists. Funky coffee bar a nice touch.  *Music, diverse crowd, diverse menu and awesome cocktails make me want to camp out during Happy Hour and people watch.  *Everything I have tried is pretty good. I suggest splitting everything so you and your group can try more items.  *Vegan menu amazing!  *Restrooms are clean...a rarity in Fremont.  The bad:   -Any expert nacho maker will tell you to put some toppings on bottom. We were disappointed no meat or beans under first layer. If I'm gonna pay $17 for nachos \"placement\" is important! lol...I'm a snob I know.  -Meat can be a bit dry, maybe if stored in its own juices it would lock in flavor.  -Parking only on street at meter's.  - Small and dimly lit. If you need personal space then don't come here at night.  My questions:   Would I brave the scorpion cocktails or the Thai or dessert nachos? Not sure but they look cool.   Was the rancho sauce really homemade? It was awesome and waiter said yes but I wonder...?  My answers:  1)Put the queso on the nachos instead of plain cheese.  2) Get there before noon for lunch.  3) Don't be in a rush.  4) Expect to walk a ways if street parking is full.  I most certainly will be back.",

This place has a great atmosphere good for watching sporting events they have huge TV screens. A great drink selection and even food and appetizers. They're known for their shots that have a scorpion on the bottom of the glass I didn't try that because I was too scared. I'm giving five stars for the food not really for the service that could have been better. Maybe it was kind of busy but our server hard we came to our table and if you have to request something it took a long time. If you use your check in on yelp you get a free house Margarita so don't forget to check in. This is a good place if you want to get some Mexican food. Have a few drinks and watch the game. I wish they had one of these in Hawaii maybe one day they will ,they also have a really good happy hour if you go to the nacho daddy near downtown the prices are actually cheaper just the tip. So next time in Vegas check them out.",

I was so disappointed that we traveled all the way downtown just to be told we couldn't get what I wanted. Oh well, we ordered food anyway.  The food itself was pretty good. My cheesy nachos had delicious queso, though it was lacking the amount of jalapenos we would have liked. We asked for a side of them extra. But, our server/bartender forgot and we had to ask again 15 minutes later.  My boyfriend also ordered one of the burritos. He really liked it, and it was a generous size. He gobbled it all down. I didn't try it myself, but I trust his judgement.  We also had to ask for refills for our water, which was challenging because she spent most of her time talking to a couple and group on opposite sides of the bar.  I'm pretty set on trying these scorpion shots. But next time I will call first.  EDIT:  Just added another star to this review because I was immediately contacted by the restaurant owner to apologize for my experience. I was offered a comp and to be contacted when scorpions come in. I'm very impressed. And I am hoping very much that I can give them another try when I come back to Vegas next year! :)  EDIT AGAIN: Bartender just contacted me to apologize to me too. Seriously, this place is wowing me with their customer service. I just have to give another star. I'm going to be back next year and will definitely come here.",

Ordered a beer and a wine and the server told us the 2 most popular nachos and we decided on the Fiesta Nachos. Served up super quick and looked like the pictures. Certainly a lot for the money! Piled high and evenly covering the chips so you never ate a chip without topping. That being said, it was absolutely forgettable. Almost flavorless for me. We kept eating because we still had our drinks. I would say we left over half of it there. It's mostly a 20-30 year old crowd, so maybe that's part of the 4 stars. If your namesake is your signature dish, I thought it would be unforgettable. Wish I had taken advantage of the \"check-in margarita,\" though. Not in a hurry to go back.  Although I appreciate the response from this establishment, I do wish it weren't such a \"canned\" one. All the comments to reviews has the exact same last paragraph.",

I enjoyed the nachos so much..it was different and such a great combination (mouth-watering just thinking about it). Fish tacos was good too..I cannot remember what fish it was but I loved it. No complains at all about the food or the service. Got couple of margaritas too...(thanks to yelp checkin got them for free) however found them a little bit sweet.

We got the BBQ Pork Nachos to share. The BBQ sauce was strongly on the vinegar side, not very sweet at all. And it really needed more queso to balance that out. Bummer. There's too much awesome Mexican food in this city to ever choose this place.",

When our food arrived, they asked if they can lit our fajitas on fire, (\"sure\") oh man my son got a kick out of that lol. The chicken and beef fajitas had flavor. I even loved how it had a little bit of that charred flavor too. So i knew it was freshly cooked. The margarita was made perfectly. Not too tart but just right. I explained to the waiter how it was our first time and that we loooved our experience. Since we're locals, I think we found our new hang out spot. Thanks Nacho Daddy",

Both were great chips! Living in Houston, that is important. I recommend going there before or after you've gotten drunk. Those chips are good and you can absorb some of that alcohol with some food. The Triple dip was very popular, and you can't go wrong with that, plus a drink, before engaging into the nights activities.",

    "text": "Sorry as this review is a little on the late side. We must of driven by Nacho Daddy a million of times from Downtown Fremont Street to the strip and never even thought about stopping in until one morning when we were looking for something to eat and turned to Yelp for suggestions.  At that time they were running a promotion for a free house margarita when you check in and bam that caught our eyes.  In a city where liquor prices are up there and to get a free margarita just for checking in???  We had to at least check in and get our free margarita. We found street parking right there on 4th Street.   We walk in and this place looks like a legit Mexican biker bar straight out of the movies and we liked it. After getting seated we were looking through the menu and our waitress came to take our orders so we showed her our check in for margarita and she smiled like she never saw that before and told us that it will take a little while as they are short handed at the bar. Short handed was right.  Our waitress was also the bartender, server and bus person. So yes our drinks took awhile. But when they came, it came in these huge glasses so we thought that no way they could taste good but one sip and we knew it was worth the wait. It was one of the bigger and best tasting margaritas we ever tasted. While they don't have that promotion when you check in, you can go to their Yelp page and you can click the 1 free margarita to be sent to your phone.  Yes sometimes you have to work for what you want and trust me, it's worth the effort to get it. Hey it's free and good and huge.  On to the food. My nephew got the Breakfast Burrito ($10.95). You have a choice of sausage or bacon. Of course scrambled eggs, melted cheese, hash browns and ranchero sauce. It came with it's own house made chips and salsa.  He couldn't contain himself as he dug into this behemoth of a burrito. I asked him how did he like it?  All he could do was nod his head and give and give a thumbs up.   My better half got their Steak Omelet ($13.95 +$2 for egg white) and was happy to hear that they could make it with all egg whites for an extra charge. The steak was a nicely marinated, with pico de Gallo and melted jack and cheddar cheese. It was came with salsa and hash browns.   For myself and yes I shared, I got their Supreme Tostada Nachos ($17.50). A big pile of nachos that came with seasoned ground beef, they got every cheese in the house and sprinkled it all on.  Refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, you name it and it was on there.   It was only 9:45 am and we were stuffed and pre-gamed all in one sitting.  Great chill atmosphere, good service considering they were short handed, great food and drinks.  Nacho Daddy, we will come back and conquer your delicious food and drinks and we will say who's your daddy!  Their hours: Sunday - Wednesday 8am - 2am Thursday - Saturday  8am - 3am",

Service: we sat on the bar and both of the girls bartered were very nice very professional.

The last time we came, we were at the bar and strawberry w/ mango (blended) margaritas was PERFECT. Thick, sweet and hit us the right way!

    "text": "Came in last night based off recommendations from friends. Decided to sit at the bar as I typically do. It was jamming when I showed up. So much that the bar was nearly full. I squeezed in and buckled up for the experience. I was told I couldn't go wrong w/ anything on the menu. As I looked over the menu, I wasn't approached the first 5 minutes of being seated. I blamed it on perhaps it was busy. However the bartender that finally did eventually took my order after flagging him down had passed by me about 10-15 times. I rarely have to ever flag down a bartender, they are typically on top of who just sat down. Not this bartender. I thought maybe he might be new.   I provided my drink order as did my colleague. The bartender was ready to leave to go make the drinks w/o asking if we were ready to order. So before we let him go, since it took so long for him to acknowledge us, we let him know we were ready to place our food order too.   About probably 10 minutes later our drinks arrived from our bartender. He slid my drink to my colleague and hers to me. We figured it was clear who's drink was who's but obviously not, especially since he took the order. We shrugged it off as a simple mistake and it wasn't him being lazy.   About another 10 minutes and our food was out. My colleague had been here before and she talked up these vegan avocado tacos. While I stayed basic and got some boneless wings. I had to flag down our bartender again to get utensils and napkins, which is typically provided right after you order at the bar. I got about 8 wings which were fine. Nothing great or bad about them. My colleague was right about the vegan avocado tacos. As we scarfed down our food we saw our bartender walk in front us numerous times again w/o even checking on us to see if we needed anything or to see if the food was okay. The food runner had brought out some food for another customer, but didn't know who ordered it. When he asked the bartender, the one that took the order, he seemed to have no clue. Luckily the customer saw her food and claimed it.   We began to assume that the bartender was actually a bar back w/ some of the side work he was doing. However outside of him there was only one other bartender. Even when that other bartender came to our side of the bar, he didn't see if we needed anything. Even when our glasses were empty and our plates cleaned, no one took them from us for quite some time. Not even a touch base to see if we wanted another margarita. We eventually flagged down a bartender to get our check.  This place is probably great if you've been drinking and need to soak up the alcohol or a good place to pad it before you start drinking. From the service standpoint, I probably wouldn't sit at the bar again. I tend to have better service at the bar anywhere else than at a table solo or w/ one other person. Not here though.",

    "text": "I don't know how Nacho Daddy can call itself a nacho establishment. I think Nacho Disappointment would be a better name.   I was able to get a free house margarita from a Yelp check-in which was a nice plus.  I consider myself a Nacho Connoisseur and have been to many Nacho establishments. I had made the long trek from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in pursuit of the best nachos in the entire cosmos. I did not know that I would defile my tastebuds with the \"Fiesta Nachos\".  The most quintessential part of the Nacho is the chips. There was a severe lack of chips with my \"Nachos\". It felt more like a burrito bowl with a small number of chips sprinkled in. How could a place that boasts \"Gourmet Nachos\" not respect the topping to chip ratio?  The toppings contained some flavor. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't up to my Nacho standards. There was a clear emphasis on the quantity of toppings rather than the overall quality.  I would not recommend Nacho Daddy to even my worst of enemies. I would look elsewhere for your Nachos needs.",

Like I said, great host. When I tabbed out I learned that if I brought the receipt in during the morning, I got a free breakfast. WHAT??? I love this place. Of course I ordered a couple bloody marys with it...so it was a win/win for everyone. The breakfast was a great skillet with eggs, potatoes, cheese and chourizo...pretty awesome.

This restaurant has the fancy Ferrari designed Coca Cola machine so I indulged in a Cherry Coke. We decided to share an order of nachos, tostada style, and an order of grilled mahi mahi tacos. The tacos turned out to be one in the case of the fish option, but our server insisted it would be enough food. Our server and the others seemed very young and not supervised, but were all very smiley and all kept busy even though the restaurant was quiet.  The food came out very quickly and was really good! The taco was my preference, I will totally order it again. A fresh flour tortilla, slightly crisper and loaded with two small tender mahi filets, cabbage, chipotle cream, salsa cruda. It was so delicious I almost couldn't stop eating at the halfway mark! The nachos were very good as well, loaded with seasoned beef, refried beans, Pico de gallo, queso and shredded cheeses, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, fried jalapenos.  I highly recommend this place for quick lunch or late bar bites. Really accessible menu for picky groups. I'll have to try a burger next time for sure.",

Total bill for all 3 not to exceed 600.00 total or 200.00/couple.   All 6 of us have been to & loved the Henderson location so when Nacho Daddy opened in the DTLV it was our 1st choice to go to for dinner.   We arrived still a bit sated and slightly tipsy from our last stop. *not to worry we who live in Vegas make sure not to drink & drive*   When we arrived *slightly late but we called* they had our table all ready & waiting. Our server was Chris who was amazing at keeping our glasses full.  We started with a round of Lambics - just to clear the palate.  Followed by a pitcher of perfect Margaritas. Normally not the best idea because for some reason in other places we've found that the pitcher method loses some of the quality of the actual cocktail. Not in the case of the Big Daddy's. consistent tot he last drop.   For food - we decided on 3 different types of nachos  Florentine: Chicken Spinach & asiago cheese.  very light & different from the nachos we've had previously. Excellent choice for a vegetarian as they will make them - the chicken. By far my personal favorite. Kind of like a nice spinach dip with the chips already in.   Thai Chicken:  not my personal favorite but everyone else loved them. Basically it was a nice pad thai on nacho chips and very SPICY. it was very flavorful but I was enthralled with the Florentine.  Fiesta Chicken Nachos: Closest to what is expected in a traditional American nachos amped up with the addition of the diablo sauce. One of the \"boys\" tried to lick the plate.   Speaking of \"boys\" the urinal block is hysterical. yes I looked.   We each had an order of corn on the cob & shared 2 bowls of the queso dip.   Food:  consistent with the Henderson location.  Service: Exceptional. Chris gets 5 ***** (for vegas, someone that attentive to a large party is very unusual)  Fat Friendly:  All seats were armless so no hip issues. also spaced far enough apart that we didn't have to sit back to back with our neighbor. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night in off season, but there was ample room. Doubt that would be the case during Life is Beautiful or EDC.  Ambiance: much more cosy & conducive to conversation than the Henderson location.   Total bill including tip: $206.00   It was a great choice & w've been back since and still consistent with the food & the services!",

Like somebody (namely our waiter, Jon and Brandon) really cared about us.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  Our friends had the Fajitas and there was plenty of food for the two of them and they had some left over. My husband and I each had a different type of Burrito and they were fabulous.     We were thrilled with this find!! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.",

My friend thought they would bring us chips and salsa but no, it was $3.50 when the menu said it would be $2.95 so that is my first problem with this place!!  Then I ordered the Vegan guacamole and mango salsa tacos.  I am sorry to say they were very unpleasant.  I am not sure if it is not \"mango season\" or what the deal is, but the \"guacamole\" was a misnomer--it was not full of guacamole like you might expect because there were no animal products-it just seemed like an afterthought.  My second problem with this place is that a diet soda is $2.95.  Come on, seriously?  you serve it in a little plastic cup.  Nothing fancy.  I will not be back here.  Save your money for the other businesses popping up downtown.",

Not your standard Mexican restaurant I would say . My favorite is the street tacos ( Delish) , the naked chicken wings ( not fried or battered ) actually made with a dry rub and grilled , the lobster dishes on the menu are to die for and did I mention they have a nacho caramel apple pie ? So freaking amazing ! They also have a healthy meal option too and vegan ! I would highly recommend this place for food .",

    "text": "I went here a couple of weeks ago for lunch. We dined at the down town location. Cute name. Clearly marketing to the tourists as there is a bar that opens to the street. Medium sized dining area. What put me off almost immediately is when I went to the website lunch specials were listed. However, when I went there the waitress new nothing about it and asked the manager, the manager then came over and explained that the lunch specials were only for the Henderson location and not downtown. I will own up that it was my mistake upon review of the website again when you download the menu it states Henderson menu and when you scroll down to the very bottom then there is a cover sheet stating Las Vegas menu that does not list lunch specials. Nonetheless, this left a bad taste in my mouth.   As to the food, a bit pricey in my opinion for what you get. I will admit that I am a nacho snob - I love nachos and if I am going to splurge they better be darn good. I like traditional nachos piled high with gooey cheese (love the nachos at Big Dog's) and avant-garde nachos such as the asian nachos at Grand Luxe. The nachos sounded good, we ordered the cheeseburger nachos and bbq pulled pork nachos. The queso sauce was smooth and creamy and the pulled pork was sweet although not great bbq but I didn't expect that from here.  Cheeseburger nachos, well, were like a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, ground beef etc. They were approximately $10 each. They were good but again nothing phenomenal and for the price not a whole lot there. I was full but had I been any hungrier would not have been. And I am pretty sure other people in the group were not full. There were three plates of nachos shared among four people.   They had one of those new help yourself Coke machines with the different flavors. Overall I have mixed feelings about the Coke machine. You have to get your own drink which I am okay with but if there is anyone standing at the drink machine you may be in for a long wait as they ponder their drink selection.  Anyway, cute idea but I won't be coming back.",

I called and asked if they could fax it and their fax machine was also not working.  They had someone deliver a menu to my office (they don't even deliver food).  That's a good start!  Or so I thought. Not sure if everyone is drunk when they review this place or what but the food was horrible.  No one in my office was satisfied with their food.  I ordered the Supreme Tostada Nacho and it ended up missing half of the things that are listed as being on it (fried jalapenos, avocado lime salsita, cilantro, etc).  It was some bland beef, bland fake cheese and a little real cheese on top of greasy chips.  Not sure how they can pride themselves on their nachos when I could get better ones from Taco Bell.   Another co-worker got steak street tacos - she said they were bland and nothing to write home about.  The wings were also not very tasty.   So much for a new lunch spot downtown for us....",

    "text": "CHECK YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE YOU PAY!  Classic tale of how bad service can ruin your entire experience.  I frequent the Nacho Daddy in the Henderson area, to the point where the servers pretty much know what I am having so I was eager to try the downtown location. I went in on a Saturday afternoon. The menu is completely different than the Henderson location, but they have an awesome happy hour and everything tasted good. I was with a party of four, and we decided to split our checks. I offered to pay for our appetizer, and didn't think too much when my check came in a little higher. When I got home later that night and cleaned by bag, I realized that I was charged for than double price for my entree. I called the next morning hoping that the problem could be corrected via phone. I was told that I had to physically go downtown, which is a hassle from Aliante. I asked for gas for the inconvenience. Anthony, the manager, proceeded to call me a liar among other things.. just completely unprofessional.  I was later allowed to come collect the difference. The server confirmed her mistake. The assistant manager was just as rude as Anthony, and not once did anyone offer an apology.   I can say with great confidence, that I will never step foot in another Nacho Daddy. If you're in Henderson, check out Zabas or Chipotle nearby. Downtown there are plenty of substitutes that won't try to rip you off.",

I have been a faithful customer at Nacho Daddy for years and this was really disappointing. Because of this bartender alone, I and my friends will not attend this establishment. She worked at least from 11:30 to midnight tonight (11/25) pm, because someone in our group had to use the restroom, this bartender felt the need to attack us as we walked in the door. We will explain to our friends that this bartender alone is the reason that no one should feel welcome to this establishment. After an attempted explanation of our friend going to the bathroom, we were attacked and criticized for using the establishment for that reason and immediately left.  We will recommend to our friends and relatives that the location in Henderson is the more welcome location in town.",

    "text": "Horrible service!  I'm a patient man, but seriously! It's seems that out servers were more interested in drinking with each other and having social time then making sure we had drinks and food.  Then getting napkins was like pulling teeth.  We asked for forks 4 times ! It's wasn't until the food came that the food runner brought us some. He should have been out server.  The food is good and it's sad that service sucks!  So many places downtown up and coming and this could be a great place if they get their act together.  Tables should be attended all the time and when you have a large party ordering shots , drinks and food you would think they would want the business.  Very disappointed !",

The last person answered again, I said I wanted to talk to the manager, places on hold again for another few minutes. The manager answered, I spoke with her about how ridiculous it is to have to wait that long to try to pay for my food over the phone...the order vanished, however she knew it was supposed to be a bbq chicken nacho and a chicken fiesta nacho. She was basically having to retake the order, \"the computers are down\" I was told. I ended up just canceling the order because the amount of time it took for me to be on the phone, I could have walked down to Fremont street and eaten something by the time the order and delivery would have even happened. The only reason why I'm giving it a 2-star rating is because the manager offered me a gift card if I should decide to order with them again.  I can't even base my review of their food, it is purely all based off of customer service. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS TO PAY FOR IT OVER THE PHONE...WHO SERIOUSLY DELIVERS WITHOUT ASKING FOR UPFRONT PAYMENT OR ASKING IF IT'S CASH???? Oh wait, they do.",

My sister got the regular nachos for 7.50, she was SO HAPPY. I'm lactose intolerant so I didn't get to give them a try but APPARENTLY they are some of the best nachos she's ever had - I'll trust her opinion. :) We also ordered chips & guac. I loved the guac, it had a great flavor. We also ended with a margarita. They were very large and fairly strong! Three of us ended up sharing it.   If you're strolling around on Fremont, stop in. It's priced well and I mean how can you go wrong?!",

Then the bill took even longer to arrive. It didn't ruin the experience but it was frustrating.   I ordered a normal margarita on the rocks and it was terrible. So sour that it made me sick.

If they taste as good as they smell, oh my!!  Happy with my fillet minion taco, perfectly cooked steak with the heat of the house made red sauce.  If margaritas are your thing go for the Daddy's Marg. It features house made sweet and sour. It's the freshest I've ever had. To kick it up with spice and classic Mexican flavors do yourself a favor and get the Mexican Candy Margarita. It's got a kick to it, with fresh jalapenos, tapatio, and rimmed with Mexican seasoning salt. YUM!  Thank you to our server Sabrina for taking great care of us! Food came out fast, especially for a Saturday night. Drinks were always full, we always had everything we needed. The whole team here has a good vibe!   Good music and TVs with sports too. This place has it all. Do yourself a flavor favor and get off the strip for this local gem",

Our waitress seemed to keep getting bumped by someone else, and there'd be a lack of things we needed like forks and plates.  Three of us shared the Thai chicken nachos, and it was just enough. The pickled jalapenos are unbelievably spicy! But love the homemade spinach tortilla chips and white queso, and then the sweetness from the other sauces.",

The pitcher of margaritas was weak and didn't even get a buzz (the pitcher cost was over $35, and still no buzz...boo!) The nacho trio was good. I like that they have queso blanco and it had a nice flavor. The service was mediocre. My server wasn't very attentive once he realized we only wanted drinks and a snack (bill was still over $50).",

And they have THE best margaritas.  We are usually forced to sit at the bar unless we want to wait long amounts of time for a table.  No reservations on weekends.  You can still order food at the bar so if you are feeling hungry right then and there just sacrifice the extra space.  Seating seems to be very limited considering the amount of people that spend time on Fremont St.    The female bartenders I've had tend to ignore the women and wait for their male counterparts to take over.  On more than one occasion, I've had to place my order with a waiter who isn't even supposed to be tending the bar b/c the female bartender was too focused on flirting with the male customers lol.   It's annoying but not enough to stop me from going to the ND closest to me.  The food is always delicious and there is more than enough to go around.  We always end up splitting ours.  Besides being ignored at the bar, the employees are super sweet and accommodating.",

The filet mignon was delicious but I think we ate the meat too fast so we ended up with just the other toppings. If you check-in, you can get a free house margarita. I read reviews and learned you could upgrade it, so I got a White Peach Margarita- whoop!  Overall, the service here is fantastic. The servers are so friendly and attentive.

I ordered the street tacos - 2 lobster and crab and 1 crispy avocado. I'm a huge avocado fan but never had it fried before. I was skeptical but holy cow. I may have liked it a little more than the lobster and crab. Don't get me wrong thou. Both tacos were delicious, I've just never had anything like the fried avocado. If I were to do it over again, I'd probably get 2 crispy avocado and 1 lobster & crab. I'm also a big seafood fan too.   The only part that was less than ideal was the women's bathroom situation. There was a long line, messy and I believe the stalls ran out of toilet paper.  I originally went in to use the bathroom and ended up just washing my hands, wiping them on my jeans and proceeded back to the bar.",

About half an hour in I see a few tables unoccupied, I ask the hostess if we can put the table together to fit us. She says \"you have 7 more minutes\". I'm over her. But I love these nachos. But you need to replace that rude person in the front. If she doesn't want to be here, get another. Professionalism is everything. Oh yeah, so is customer service. ;)   Try it...love it...Yelp it.",

They even had lots of vegan options for my best friend! Make sure you do the yelp check in for a free house marg didn't realize it until I already ordered one of the specialty margs but they take 8.95 off of any marg you order if you don't get the house. Got the tostado nacho which has a little bit of spice to it I liked it. Highly recommend this place ended up going back to the location in planet Hollywood the next day before we left because we split the nachos the night before and wish we got our own so ended up ordering our own the next time still wasn't able to finish it lol",

The food is great but prepare to wait for no real reason while your waiter leisurely  chats with their colleagues. This place seems to really hate its patrons. You might be told that the wait is 45 minutes but half of the tables are empty with only dirty dishes on them. If you have a high tolerance for terrible service then I'd totally recommend any of the nachos. They are the bomb.",

I ordered my drink (white peach margarita) and waited quite awhile for my server to come back. The host was super nice and apologized for dropping the ball. They offered us complimentary drinks for the whole party.   We ordered our food, but it was a lengthy wait. When we finally got our food it was average. The Queso dip was the best thing we had. The nachos and tacos were average at best. Nachos didn't have enough cheese. Chicken on the nachos were on the dry side. We got the beer battered fish tacos. They were alright, nothing special.   Overall giving the place a 3 stars. Long wait for food but nice servers plus comp drinks for the wait. Average food.",

I came here with a large group before Life is Beautiful festival in downtown Vegas and we were seated within 10 minutes, which was awesome. The service was great and pretty quick, considering our party size. The chips and salsa were good and paired beautifully with my Yelp check-in margarita :)  We got a few different kinds of nachos, and although they were good, I definitely don't think they were worth the price. There wasn't a lot of steak on them and the toppings weren't very layered so the eating experience went downhill after eating the first chips. All in all, though, there was a lot of food so I wasn't too upset about it.   I probably would come back for drinks, and order something besides nachos because the rest of the menu looked delicioso!   Also, they have a photo booth inside which is always a plus for me!",

The tortilla soup was perfect for my stomach as I was feeling a bit sick. Paired with the rice, it made for a very filling meal. I especially liked the chicken in the soup, along with the crunchy tortilla strips. My tablemates enjoyed the chicharrones and corn as well.

They really weren't that good. Coming from LA we have a ton of vegan nachos and burritos that are a lot better and cheaper: Not only did we not enjoy the food but we are both still sick from the food.  Our friend ordered the pulled pork nachos and he also had numerous bathroom runs. Not sure what is in their food but it definitely didn't sit well with us.   Vegans- there are a lot of other  vegan options that are also much cheaper! Chipotle tastes better than this.",

If you love Nachos, they got Nachos here. Lots and lots of Nachos to choose from. Not only were the combinations unique, they were super tasty! The cheese sauce was simply divine. Not even close to the jarred crap you find in the super market. The flavors blended together nicely. It also was nice that you got a heaping portion of these tasty treats.  Speaking of tasty treats, the margaritas were very good too. Once again, nothing was just plain and simple. I had a Sriracha Blood Orange Margarita and my wife opted to try the Pomegranate Margarita. Full of good liquor and juices.   I almost got the courage to try their famous scorpion shot, but then I chickened out. Oh well, next time =)",

Tonight we found ourselves out and about downtown for our friends birthday, and inevitably end up here to do this \"Scorpion Shot.\"  I asked our server Aerrick what the spirit was in this shot, he replied \"what ever you like\" - well I tequila. The other 4 had Mezcal.  The whole time Aerrick was super awesome, he was friendly and didn't seem annoyed by our obnoxious birthday boy. He frequently fist bumped and was most definitely attentive.   Our waters came first, as expected. Beers and margaritas to follow - and just after the food order we had our shots delivered. 5 shots down & A few entrees later we receive our bill.   All of the Mezcal shots were $20 and rang in as \"scorpion\" something. And then there was mine. \"Don Julio 70\" FOR $29.  $29? Are you kidding? I drink 1942 at Goldspike for $25. Let me tell you that it isn't the price point that has me bothered, it's the fact that our server failed to mention the bump or that Don Julio 70 was all he had. I would've swapped it for Mezcal.   I work in the industry and this is completely unacceptable. Lesson learned for this place - ASK PRICE POINTS AND CHECK RECEIPTS.   Maybe this was just a button error, and maybe I should have said something... But after almost an hour with a bunch of drunks I was just ready to go.",

He never came around to fill waters or get second drink orders which we all wanted.  He added people's bills together.  It was so bad I didn't leave a tip at all which I've never done because I was a server for many years and know how difficult the job can be.the food was jus ok not nearly good enough to make up for it.

    "text": "My biggest gripe here is the service. They need to get it together regardless of whether they're having a bad day or not. Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job. Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it. Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying \"hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy\" or \"hey, how's it going\" or even \"hi\", she says \"what can I get for you?\" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos. She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables. And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, \"she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now.\" Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.  I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it. We all do things we don't wanna do.",

Everything started out fine, but after ordering our margaritas and food we waited. This wouldn't be a problem but we were 1 of 2 tables in the restaurant. I happened to look over at the bar and saw the bar tender standing there. Then I saw our drinks sitting there. Our waiter passed our drinks at least 4 times that I saw and never brought them to our table. We also ordered 3 street tacos as an appetizer, I;m not sure how long those were sitting there, but it was a huge let down. Obviously, we left and felt bad about not paying for our water glasses. As we were walking out, the waiter had the nerve to say, \"thanks for coming in\". Thank's for not serving us. Upon complaining we were offered to come back, but we are on vacation and have everything planned out. You lost that chance when you treated us like dirt. It sucks that we have planned on eating at this place for months and we were treated so bad. Save your money and go somewhere that wants you there.",

I kick my self for not asking her name.. She took our drink order which consisted of beer and 2 shots or tequila.. Then she was gone.. 15 mins later she came back and brought the tequila.. My husband asked where his beer was and she said I'm getting it.. Another 15 mins went by and this time another bartender came on shift and I asked for our bill.. I said all we had was tequila.. She said well it looks like you also had beers.. I said you are right we ordered the beers but were never served them.. So we got the check for our 2 shots of tequila, paid and left.. I honestly was very excited to try this place and I am extremely upset with the service and will never be back.. We should have listened to the hotel staff whom warned us about Nacho Daddy..",

We were seated and served quickly, the waitress was quick, efficient and friendly. The place was good for kids because it was separated from the bar area by a wall, I am not sure how kid frinedly it would be at night with a full bar.  My 7 year old got the kids nachos, my wife got the pork tacos and I got the supreme tostada nachos. We all loved our food it was delicious. The pork taco's were the best we had ever had, the kids nachos were tasty and the cheese sauce it really good. The supreme nachos were excellent and slightly hot due to the fried jalapenos. The only complaint would be that the supreme nachos were a little smaller than I expected. My wife ordered a Mango Thai Basil Margarita and she said it was tasty and she enjoyed it. We all shared a Churro sundae and it was so good. We couldn't finish it all but we tried. It comes with chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauce with 4 churros. We had a great late lunch and it was well worth the trip to Fremont. We will definitely be back again!",

With all of the excellent food offerings in the downtown Las Vegas area, it is extremely important to put ones best foot forward on the food scene. There were several strikes for this restaurant in my opinion, the first being that as soon as my family was seated, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes. With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS! Are you kidding me!?! That's even unreasonable for Vegas! We weren't on the main strip. Not even on the Fremont Street strip. I do not recommend this place AT ALL.",

Even though my plate arrived with rice, I was quickly presented with a side of refrieds in an iron dish. My daughter's bean cheese wet burrito was a good size, served with chips. Also ordered chips & salsa, yumminess. Good food, good portions. Service was great, thanks ladies! Enjoyable.",

    "text": "I'm addicted to this place! The Daddy's Supreme Chicken Tacos are to die for, every mouthful makes me say mmmmm.  One thing I didn't expect at a place called Nacho Daddy, was the best wings in town!! I LOVE them, they're huge and meaty, with lots of extremely tasty sauce on them. Seriously, try them!  Another favorite of mine is the chips and salsa. So very fresh, obviously made to order. Plus, they're bottomless! Can't beat that!!  Literally every thing I've had here is amazing. The only thing that gets iffy is the service. Last time I waited about fifteen minutes before I even got to order a drink, and they weren't that busy. But, I'll deal with it to get the amazing food!",

    "text": "My group was hanging out on Fremont Street and people were hangry. So hangry in fact, that after attempting to find a place to accommodate 10 people, most of the group headed back to the hotel.  That left 4 of us to get something to stuff our faces with. We went with Nacho Daddy which turned out to be an awesome decision.  It was not crowded at all on a Monday night, so we were sat quickly and placed our appetizer and drink order. We went with the pulled pork BBQ nachos, which turned out to be phenomenal. The pork was good (not the best I've had but this ain't dixieland), but the sauce and queso made this spectacular. Their BBQ sauce was very tangy, with just enough sweet and a little kick at the back end. The white queso was interestingly underneath the pile of chips and toppings but it works well as it keeps the slimy chip situation to a minimum.  Our margaritas took a while to obtain but were good. Mine was the house rita, which was a tad sweet but mixed strong enough and with fresh lime juice.  Everyone at the table ordered various iterations of Gringo and Street Tacos. I personally got the steak filet ones which were great. I would have preferred shredded cheese to queso, but it turned out ok. Others in my party were really impressed with the shredded pork tacos. Refried beans were on point as well. The Spanish rice was unimpressive, it was a bit overcooked but had the right flavor.  The only reason I gave this only 4 stars was because the bar was a little too slow in getting drinks out. Our server was awesome! We were given great recommendations and he took a few pictures of our group since we learned he's a serious photographer!  Should we find ourselves hangry or even hungry on Fremont Street again, this place will be in the short list for sure!",

We ordered the steak fajita nachos (the ones with filet mignon), the flavor was on point. Wish the peppers and onions were more chip or bite size and the steak was tough and my husband was actually digging to find any. We also ordered a chicken quesadilla, wish there was more cheese and chicken and there was melted cheese that was cooked to crisp on the outside? Not sure why unless to add crunch but all it did was make it taste like burnt cheese. Would possibly go back again, but prices were a bit high for what we were served which was a bit disappointing. The bartender seemed nice at first, but even sitting right there didn't check in on us except for \" y'all are good right?\" Once.",

Hot water was broke, so no coffee. You'd think they would boil some on the stove next to the refried beans. Not that much culinary creativity in Vegas.   Had a bloody Mary that was fine. Checked into Yelp and got a coupon for a free house margarita. There's a reason it's free. Lemonade would have been better.   Smoked wings were tasty, but rubbery. They need to fry them after they are smoked to crisp them up. Breakfast slider, tacos and enchilada rancheros were good.   Glad I came, might try the nachos if I come back.",

Nacho daddy fell short to say the least... the wait was long... clearly they were under staffed for a Sunday game day. And be it that a HUGE music festival was down the way they should've been more prepared. You pour cheese on chips... we shouldn't have waited 1hr and 10mins for our food. I'm sure the margarita I ordered made my stomach hurt therefore I couldn't even eat my food. And the party next to use was just as upset.   The waiter was okay but he seemed MAD that I even spoke up about the experience. You guys can do better. But I won't be back.",

    "text": "The food here is amazing, the drinks are pretty good as well. This is a little hidden place in old Vegas strip off of 4th street. Our server Jose was awesome! Got our drinks order as soon as we sat down, that that started the night. Between my friends and I we split a couple of different dishes. We got a chimichanga, supreme nachos, quesadilla and a corn on a cob. Everything tasted delicious, it is the best drunk food. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free house margarita and the drink is STRONG for being free. Music is on point and the environment is a cute little dive bar feel.   Must try this place when you're in the area! Definitely the best nacho place I've had in a while!  Service: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Drinks: 10/10 Price: 10/10",

    "text": "We came in on a Saturday night so we expected to have a long wait.  But a 30 minute wait wasn't bad.  This place is loud and cramped!  We didn't mind the noise but feeling cramped is never a good thing.   Going through the menu, there were a lot of dishes we wanted to try.  They have a large a menu so we needed extra time to order.  In the meantime, we ordered a Daddy's Margarita and a White Peach Margarita to help us decide.  Both were really good and plentiful.  I loved that it wasn't watered down and you can clearly taste the alcohol.   We finally decided on the menu. For starters we ordered the ceviche.  This was pretty good. Not too salty and ingredients tasted fresh (minus the shrimp).  What I didn't like was that the ceviche to chips ratio was way off. Too much chips, not enough ceviche.  It seemed you had to stack 3 chips together to get the ratio right.  For our main dishes we ordered the Cajun Nachos and the Baja Seafood Combo.  These portions are huge!  The Cajun Nachos could have easily been split between 2 average eaters.  This nacho dish has shrimps, andouille sausage, and cajun spices. And let me tell you, Nacho Daddy didn't skimp on the shrimps and sausage.  This dish literally overflowed with them. This dish ended up being too rich. It was hard to finish this because the spices became overwhelming.  But I think that if this was shared, it probably wouldn't have been that rich.  Another thing I didn't like was the shrimps were the frozen kind.  They did little to mask that.   The Baja Seafood Combo  definitely a better choice between the 2.  This dish consist of fish tacos and lobster/crab enchiladas with rice.  This too was rich in flavor but better balanced.  I would definitely order this again.    Our server did a good job managing the packed house.  The only complaint I have was that he forgot to put my credit card back with the receipt.  We walked out thinking that one of us grabbed it.  It took him a while to find it but eventually did.",

When we arrived, the restaurant was occupied, but definitely not full or too busy.  Our server was friendly, but extremely slow.    We ordered the $20 bottomless mimosas and stayed eating our brunch and watching some basketball for probably about 2 hours.  In the span of the 2 hours of being there, we only got 3 mimosas.  Every time the server checked on us, we asked for another refill and it would take an extremely long time to get another glass.  The mimosas were probably 3/4 orange juice, 1/4 champagne.  I would say go for the beer and margaritas (which I guess should have been obvious, but I can't pass up mimosas after being hungover).  The beers came out in huge mugs and I believe were only $8 or $10.    My friends that ordered traditional breakfast items said the food tasted oily.  My vegan chick'n nachos were pretty good, though the fake chicken was hard to chew.  My boyfriend loved the shrimp nachos he ordered.  So the overall take from the table was that the food quality was okay.  It's a good spot to hang out, albeit a bit dark, but not a bad spot to catch a game with some beers and nachos.  Just don't expect fast refills.",

So leave your foodie-badge at home, get some friends together, get yourselves sloshed, and scarf down the nachos for a killer good time in Downtown Vegas!  3   S T A R S  * NACHOS + BOOZE CAN'T LOSE :::: The Nachos -- The perfect BOOZE FODDER! Nacho-greatest example of gourmet Tex-Mex, but PHENOMENALLY SATISFYING when you're 2 beers and 2 shots deep, and about to take a video of your poor homie chewing up and swallowing a dead scorpion on a dare. Please be courteous and vomit outside!  * PARTY PALAZZO 'Palazzo' means PALACE in Italian, as in watch your PALs get drunk off their ASSes! This is VEGAS BABY, so get STUFFED & get TRASHED, and this is a great place to do both! Rush in with your new crew of friends you just made Downtown & go 18-Dummy off their grande Tequila selection (60 varieties) while deep-throating MORE NACHOS (gross)! Watch the game on one monitor, or hilariously tacky old 70's and 80's music videos on the other, in between scorpion-shots and INSTAGRAM-selfies!  * THANKS FOR THE MEHmories I will never in my life forget this meal. I walked into a big, fun space for lunch, was waited on by a super-cool server named Elicia, devoured one  disappointing MEH dish after the next, and finished with an unforgettably bad Las Vegas decision--the Scorpion Shot! My life on this planet has been made slightly more significant by this wacky bit of suffering.  2   M I N U S E S  - MEHlancholy MEHnu Don't walk in by yourself as a foodie because you'll feel like a fool :) Let's find out why... :::: Carnitas Tacos -- Utterly Bland. If you've ever experienced eye-fluttering ecstasy from expertly crafted tender-juicy-crispy-salty carnitas tacos then DO NOT order them here. It'll MEHk you sad. :::: Battered Fish Taco -- Decent. Best thing I ordered. Great texture, good flavors. ... So then I tried to redeem the meal with what I thought would be a guaranteed winner, but it was even more MEH! :::: MEHxican Roasted Corn -- Like a disappointing Tinder date. She seemed so hot until we MEHt. Too little mayo, too little cotija cheese, no chili powder, no lime, and the corn was wet roughage--not sweet enough. Complete fail.  - SCORPION SHOT: MASOCHISTS ONLY! Probably the go-to hazing ritual of UNLV fraternities. On par with eating a rotten shrimp head from the bottom of a Panda Express dumpster. Chewing into the guts of the scorpion, realizing that its half-decayed organs were all over my teeth, and then washing it down with a shot of tequila was a 5-second NIGHTMARE. I almost threw up my entire lunch. So why did I do it? The server picked up on the gray glow of my meal disappointment and hit me with a brilliant up-sell. \"You know what you should try that's pretty good?\" she said with a wink, \"The Scorpion Shot! Come on, you have to do it, you're in Vegas!\" She smiled pointing to a black t-shirt they sold with '#GOTSTUNG' printed on it.  \"Awesome!\" was my innocent reply.",

We came in around 12 pm and it was pretty quiet, but it definitely seemed like it had the potential to be more of a fun, party sort of place later at night. We were just there for a quick lunch, so quiet suited us just fine. Our server Bella was very sweet and friendly.   We ordered the chicken enchilada nachos and got the check in offer for a free margarita. The nachos were seriously the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> if you're a huge wuss like me and hate spicy food, order these without the jalapenos, they were honestly the best nachos I've ever eaten. It was a huge portion, enough to easily fill 2 adults. The topping were spread evenly and very generously, not one naked chip. And speaking of the chips, they were the perfect thickness which sounds weird, but it's very important for a good plate of nachos. They need to be thin enough that it's not a chore to bite through, but thick enough to hold all of those delicious toppings, and these hit the nail on the head. I honestly left satisfied with every aspect of our experience. I will definitely be back!",

The bartender was friendly, and the portions of nachos are huge. Those were good, but do not order the wings. The sauce is served on the side, and the wings are pretty charred, making them taste somewhat burned on the outside. My buddy got fajitas which came with a second plate of all the fixings, and all that was good too. For late night I would recommend. For earlier in the day/evening I would probably keep looking.... unless you REALLY like nachos.",

    "text": "I'm going to start off with the rating. Most reviews give it 3.5/5. As much as it pains me I have to agree with the rating. The saving grace in this restaurant is the incredible food. It was our first time there so we have no clue to wait for a hostess or just sit where we please. It has the potential to be a very hip hangout if they didn't shove their merchandise down your throat. After we found a table in the small eatery we finally got to order, our choices were the beer battered lobster tacos and the fajita cheese steak. The lobster taco was on point. I was surprised that even smothered in sauce the lobster stayed crispy and delicious. Covered in fresh avocado, corn and lettuce it comes with beans and cheesy rice.   The fajita cheese steak is tasty but very greasy ( those with sensitive stomachs eat at your own risk) the bread was soaked with queso so it was difficult to eat. It only comes with fries but they were amazing in my book. I love a good pile of crispy fries. I would have liked to try the drinks and shots but unfortunately most are over priced. They have huge portion sizes but you end up paying for it.   As for the service it was not great. The waitress acted like she hated her job and didn't want to be there. Not to mention alot of things were left unclean and dusty. Like I said earlier I agree with the 3.5 rating. Perhaps in the future I can change my review. Love, Bug",

I thought about sending them back but decided to eat them anyway.  In hindsight, I probably should've returned them.  The maragaritas are really good.",

He was prompt in the beverage service and suggested that I try the Mexican cobb salad since I wanted something light. The dish was really good and had just the right amount of dressing to compliment the flavors.  I felt the food and drinks are a little over priced for what you get. Especially since There are many other great places to get a bite and a drink in the area, but I will definitely come back in the future.",
