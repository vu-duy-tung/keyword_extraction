Server was very polite and helpful.  He took orders and expedited drink/food quickly. For appetizers, we had the fried calamari and stuffed mushrooms.  The assortment of fresh bread was very filling which came with meal.  My friends sampled the bisque which they said was good. We ordered different entrees, the salmon, branzino, seafood chopped salad, and steak.  All the dishes looked very well prepared and tasted just as good.  Seafood was fresh and there was no food leftover after we finished meal.  They even brought out a birthday dessert which was a nice touch.",

Food and Service were outstanding.  We began with Stone Crabs as an app for the three of us.  Outstanding as always.  Entrees were;  petite Filet, stuffed shrimp, Scallops and crab cakes.  Sides were grilled tomatoes with cheese and spinach, Lyonnaise Potatoes and asparagus,  Food was outstanding and plentiful ( we could not finish it all).  Service was terrific, probably my favorite food in Vegas.  I come here every time I visit.  Highly recommend, make a reservation.",

We spoke with the waitress and a manager. they were both gracious and took off 20% from the bill, but the manager said that's how the crab was suppose to be, \"because it came from the ocean.\" I've never had a mealy crab before. I didn't like the texture. The flavor was good.  According to the menu, one crab claw was ripped from each crab on the boat, and the crab was then released. I'm guessing that the claw has to be frozen with this technique.  I'm accustomed to having the whole crab just boiled live. Maybe mealy crab is something to get accustomed to for sustainability?",

My husband ordered the rib eye sandwich and I ordered the maui maui lunch plate. My waitress suggest that I order a side dish because she thought it wouldn't be enough food so I ordered the heirloom tomatoes.  Someone soon brings out a bread basket, I do have to say that it was a very good above average bread basket with yummy pretzel bread, a cheese and onion roll and other breads.  We received the tomatoes and I do note that the tomatoes were stunning great tomatoes but I hated the vinaigrette because it had chunks of gelatin in it and I thought that was gross. My husband didn't mind the chunks of gelatin so some people might like it that way. I was able to eat the tomatoes if I scraped the gelatin chunks off.  We receive the meals and my husband said the rib eye was pretty good but had a lot of butter poured on it. My maui maui was nice and fresh but was DROWNING in butter. The jicama slaw that came with my meal was almost good but I couldn't eat it after I tasted it because it was totally oil saturated.  If you like LOTS of BUTTER or OIL with your food and a great bread basket EAT AT JOE'S!",

Steaks and sides didn't disappoint - had the petite 8 oz filet mignon. Sides are meant for sharing - offers sweet potato in 3 different preparations, spinach in 3 preparations. Broccolini and green beans amandine are excellent steak complements.

It's weird to have a restaurant who has Stone Crab in their name but it's not available. Friends we came with mentioned that this is their 2nd time at the restaurant and Stone Crab was not available on their 1st visit either.  Anyhow, I had Joe's green salad and I think they forgot to dress the salad and the Filet Mignon was average.  One saving grace is the key lime pie, it was good.  I guess next time, we'll have to call ahead to find out if they have stone crab before coming.",

Upon arrival, the waiter was very attentive to our needs and was excellent throughout the meal. He advised me that the cowboy oysters were very good right now and he was right. They were briny and wonderful. I was not a fan of the vinaigrette served with them, but the horseradish and cocktail sauce had a great kick and were a wonderful addition to the oysters. For the steak, I had the bone-in ribeye and sauteed spinach. The spinach was pretty average but the steak was awesome. It was cooked  a perfect medium rare with just the right amount of fat to make it delicious. My only complaint is that the steak knife was a little dull and I had to saw into a very tender steak. The waiter recommended desert while adding in some of our conversation which was a nice touch, but I could not eat any more after such a big steak, so I had a sambuca which was a nice way to end such a great meal.",

    "text": "Two visits, ten years apart and 5 stars for both visits. Joe's is my favorite Vegas restaurant and for good reason. They offer some of the best and freshest seafood around and they offer one of the best seafood items in Stone Crab Claws. The restaurant became famous from their original location in Florida and has since branched off with locations in DC, Vegas and Chicago. Joe's in Vegas is an absolute must visit for their amazing food, their amazing service and their great ambiance. Unfortunately, with all three being an integral part of the success of the restaurant, the prices are on the high side but completely worth the splurge.  The food:  Stone Crab Claws- These are the reason you visit and they are exceptional. The claws are cracked three times making them easy to eat and they have a nice sweet flavor with a really nice meaty texture. The Joe's Mustard Sauce, which is basically a Remoulade sauce, makes the perfect pairing to the crab. Remoulude is kinda like a spicy mayo with herbs, Remoulade is my favorite sauce and it is magic with the crab. They offer three different sizes for the claws and I tried the Select and Large. There is a pretty big difference in price but I did like the Large the best. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=svdUJuyjnV2Th5mT9ocCfg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Colossal Lump Crab Cakes- I love crab cakes and these were perfect. I say this is either one or two for the best crab cakes I ever had with the other being Faidley's out in Baltimore, Maryland. The crab cakes were so perfectly moist with very little filling with a very nice outer crust. The bread crumb had a great texture with a slight crunch and the Remoulade went perfectly, but honestly, I don't even know if it was even necessary since the crab cakes were so perfect, as is. This crab cake had so much crab in it, it was heaven. This is a must get. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=42v3Dc8Wnocfe98Vso1Aug&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Half Dozen Kumamoto from Humboldt Bay, California- These were great, they had so much flavor and were so perfectly creamy and delicious. I didn't think I would ever say this since Kumamtos are my fav oyster but the previous two items almost made the oysters irrelevant, even though they were great. The above two items were just that magical. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9RdQSoZ4MulGnoaJp-ryOg&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Key Lime Pie- Their famous dessert is their Key Lime Pie and it was excellent. I really loved the smooth texture and great mouth feel, I typically love crunchier crust so the one here was perfect for me. The filling had a good subtle tart flavor but I was expecting it to be a tad more tarty. The one thing that did surprise me was how god damn cold the pie came out, it was basically brain blacking out cold. lol <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rmUq6Fk1nhjF2zx7H4YyFw&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>",

Joe's simply delivered last night and definitely deserves all 5 available stars.  A classy looking place which replicates an old 20's-era steakhouse in the Forum Shop area of Caesar's. Classic large bar with a great selection of fine spirits. My Oxley gin martini was a great way to start. Paired with Kumamoto oysters, this is the way to start a meal! Besides the usual accompaniments, Joe's served a semi-frozen version of mignonette that is unique and tasty.  The grilled octopus appetizer was tremendous. Hot seafood on cold beans and greens was simply delicious.  My wife went for a classic Manhattan cocktail and we also split a small cup of Manhattan clam chowder. While we both prefer New England clam chowder, this was quite good.  Main dishes were next and I was not disappointed that I strayed from my usual steak craving and opted for the Chilean sea bass. A sweet teriyaki glaze was perfect in bringing out the flavor. My bride opted for the small filet and huge lobster tail. Another martini and a glass of excellent Cabernet helped wash down the delightful dishes. We split a classic baked potato and steamed asparagus. All were excellent. Their famous key lime pie finished off the evening perfectly.  Service from Perry and the entire staff was on point all evening. The price point was on par with excellent dining options in the area but certainly not outrageous. A perfectly wonderful dining experience.",

The food was fresh and delicious we ordered the whale, stone crab claws, and a 16oz ribeye with a side of mash potatoes. I love how they gave us an explanation of what the sauces were and had. Very beautiful presentation. The ribeye was so tender and cooked perfectly. To my surprise it was enough to fill two people. The stone crabs didn't disappoint but it didn't make me crazy about it lol. I guess I had higher expectations.  This place also gave me my first experience of \"hot towels\" I was taken by surprise when our server brought in the lemon and hot towels to clean our hands before our entree came out. I thought that was a cool experience. Great job guys!",

    "text": "Sigh, the food here disappointment me, but before I get into that, let me speak about the customer service and the restaurant itself. My family and I made reservations since it was my cousin's birthday and she wanted to have it at a classy place. We were all dressed and looking fly!! We valid parked of course and went inside. This place is absolutely beautiful and the man who greeted us was beyond nice and funny too!! The hostess walked us to our table which was a great size for the 5 of us. What I quickly noticed was that there was a family of maybe 6-7 who were dressed very very casual, as if they were at a outside park softball game. The children had coat hoods and hats on at the table and didn't look very representable for a restaurant like this. I wish their waiter, or the manager ask the parents to have their children take their hoods and hats off at the dinner table. It brought the classiness down a bit.   We ordered water first and then drinks. I ordered a glass of Rose and it was delicious and strong. The water was good too as if they used bottled water instead of sink water, lol. I ended up ordering the Seafood Pasta since it had all the yummy seafood in it and the all greens salad ($9.95). The seafood pasta came with lobster, Alaskan king crab, shrimp, and lobster broth and sound to die for ($42.95)!!! The salad came first and OMG...I split it with my cousin and I should have ordered it to eat by myself because it was delicious!! What was awesome is that the waiter knew I was sharing it with someone else and he had already split the salad between the both of us in two different plates. They also provided us with table bread that had 5-6 different choices of bread....I had the Hawaiian roll which was nice and soft. My food came, and the appearance was very beautiful and just enough for me.  I begin to eat it and to my surprise it was JUST OKAY....the pasta had no taste at all...no season, no salt, no pepper, no love at all. I added pepper, salt, and it didn't help. It was so bland, I asked the waiter if I could have some more pesto sauce, and he brought me butter.....ummmmm butter isn't going to help this dry pasta at all. My cousins (2 of them) also ordered the seafood pasta and we all felt the same way. I felt bad for the birthday girl because all she ate was the meat in it and nothing else. I ate the meat too after that I couldn't bear the bland pasta anymore. It could have been my southern roots, but I felt the chef in the back needed my assistance in the back with the pasta.  I didn't even waste my time asking for the rest of it to go because I knew I was just going to throw it away.  My other cousin ordered the Seafood Grilled Platter that came with Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Tail, and Scallops! I ended up digging my fork in her plate and her seafood was really yummy and grilled perfectly! I wish I would have gotten that and it was a few dollars cheaper. Lastly, my other cousin got the calamari and I was disappointed by the look because it seemed that the calamari came from a frozen bag. I tasted a few and there wasn't a crunch to it and it was soft....not good at all.   After an okay dinner and paying a $375 bill plus tip, we left and had drinks at a Hotel bar and closed the night eating Panda Express and sadly that satisfied me more. Will I come back here......ummmmmm, probably not on my own unless someone invites me (and they pay) and I will for sure get the salad and the grilled seafood platter and leave the pasta alone.",

    "text": "Holy orgasm in my mouth. Am I allowed to say that on Yelp??? Okay, well I said if.  BEST. CRAB. EVER.  This place better be five stars after you look at the prices on the menu, right??   Came here for my friends birthday. Had a reservation so we were seated right away without a problem.   Service was excellent and came right away to take drink orders and give everyone water. I don't remember our server's name, but she was really on top of things. She gave us the run down of the menu and was patient with our questions and orders.   Our table kind of shared a few things. I had some wedge salad, two different kinds of crab, and three different kinds of desserts. It's been a week or so now and I can't stop dreaming about the crab. The first crab I got was meant to be cold and it was just the claws. Had to work for the meat, but it was worth it. The second crab I tried, was meant to be hot and it was amazing and rich. I could only eat three pieces because it was that rich. I wish I remembered the desserts we tried because vise were also amazing. At that point, I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.  As mentioned earlier, the service was amazing. Any time my water started to go down, someone would come out of no where and fill it back up.  Definitely want to come back, but this is the type of place that should be saved for a special occasion. Hopefully something comes up soon :P",

    "text": "I have only had stone crab claws at a now closed restaurant in Newport Beach, so when I heard Joe's (originally from Miami Beach) was opening a location in the Ninth Island (Vegas), I had to hit it!  Joe's is located on the bottom floor of the Forum Shops near the main entrance.  Although their signature seafood item is stone crab claws, Joe's also offers king crab legs, lobster, oysters, and steaks.    We started off with 1/2 dozen kumamoto oysters ($16.95), the select stone crab claws (MP | $49.95 for 6), and fried calamari ($14.95).  In addition to select size crab claws, they also offer medium and large.  Sorry, only the oysters and crab claws are pictured.  First of all, the oysters were super fresh and briny.  It was a great way to start the meal w/ a savory steak to follow:  5 Stars.  Secondarily, the calamari was OK.  It was fresh, but I thought the portion was small for the price:  4 Stars.  Lastly, the crab claws were surprisingly mediocre.  I was expecting a mind numbing experience, but my cousin and I thought they were just OK.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong size, but we were not impressed:  3 Stars.  For our entrees, we ordered items like crab stuffed shrimp, filet mignon, surf & turf ($54.95), salmon, and bone-in ribeye ($54.95).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only entree pictured - LOL.  My steak was excellent.  It was huge, void of any unnecessary fat, and cooked medium rare as requested.  Additionally, it was seasoned to perfection:  5+++ Stars.  For our sides, we ordered french fries, mac & cheese, creamed spinach ($8.95) and broccolini ($9.95).  Sorry, but I was only able to take a good pic of the spinach.  All of the sides were very good, and reasonably priced compared to Mastros:  4 Stars.  For dessert, we ordered the signature key lime pie, coconut cream pie, and a brownie sundae (all $8.95 each).  You know what I ordered, because it is the only dessert pictured - Hehehe.  First of all, the key lime pie was sublime (get it?  Hahaha).  It was tart, and had a perfect graham cracker crust.  Likewise, the brownie sundae was excellent, and it was a huge portion.  My only rec is to offer walnuts on the side.  Lastly, the coconut cream pie brok da mout (tasted very, very good).  It too had a perfect graham cracker crust, but the toasted coconut put it over the top.  Joe's version of my fave pie is the best I have ever had!  I didn't mind the price, unlike overrated Pie Hole in DTLA:  All 5 Stars except the last item which was 5+++ Stars.  The service on Sun, 8/7 @ 6:30 pm from Mike V and his team was excellent.  He and the rest of the team were super nice, attentive, and just a pleasure to have as our team.  In addition, Mike was really knowledgable about pairing wines w/ entrees, and informative about the menu.  He really earned his 20% tip:  5 Stars.  Not to be outdone, the ambiance is fancy w/ a lot of dark wood.  However, it was not overly loud like Mastros Beverly Hills or Costa Mesa:  5 Stars.  I can't wait to return to the Ninth Island, and to hit Joe's again.  The food, desserts & service are fantastic, and the prices are more reasonable vs Mastros.  Dinner for 7 w/ no alcohol was $610 inc 20% tip.  I've paid more than the foregoing for a table of 5 at Mastros!!!",

Our group, which can vary from twelve to four, goes every year at a convention and the place just doesn't disappoint.   The bar knows how to make the classics because of course they do and the wine list far exceeds my knowledge but again trust your waiter to direct to a vintage and price point that works for you - ours was the Jordan Cab which may have been a little bold for my fish but I managed.  So you are at Joe's and you ARE getting crab but I am not getting Stone Crab - wtf you say - well as good as they are (and as expensive as they are) the Stone Crab is just not as good as the King Crab legs.  Where do they get them (I know water) but these put the King in King Crab and so many times when shell fish are larger they loose flavor (looking at you giant prawns and four pound lobsters) the Crab Legs are sweet with the bit of brininess and with the tiniest dip in warm drawn butter makes me a touch light headed - we had a pound and a half - I could have eaten the entire order - in fact have had clients that order the Crab as a meal after to have it as a starter.  I reiterate - do not leave the restaurant without trying the King Crab.  Also split a Caesar salad and while good - the lettuce chilled and fresh - it was missing the sharp lemon tang in the dressing and I couldn't find the anchovies at all - suppose I could have ask for some on the side but it is a large salad that easily could be shared by three.  On my visit last week I went with a friend that  suggested the Sea Bass - this is one of their specialties I just have never had (the had just run out of the Halibut Steak which is my all time fave but now that I have had the Sea Bass it is a toss up).  So the Sea Bass comes with a miso glaze that tops the filet with a golden sheen on the porcelain white fish that melts once your put it in your face - the filet is almost share-ably large (I didn't but did give out a few tastes) and was about as perfect as a piece of fish can be - served with boy choy and mushroom which were fine but the fish - oh my - the fish.  Another dining partner went with the filet - it is after all steak and seafood although I primarily think of Joe's as a seafood restaurant - I had one bite and get it - cooked exactly to medium rare - warm red center of juicy goodness - I would have been happy with the steak just not as happy as with the Sea Bass.  Also had a taste of the Scallops and while certainly good - just cooked through with a little sear on the top and bottom, I have had Scallops as good elsewhere.  We did three side - quick review - spinach was fantastic, maybe not a creamy as some but I liked it better than swimming in a gooey cream sauce, Hash Brown reached a new level in potato supremacy - dark brown char wraps close to mashed interior of creamy potato - wow, corn was more like an elote and I loved it - you could honestly make a solid meal out of just the sides - may be will next year (probs no).  As I mentioned above - service is super efficient, professional and friendly - these guys know what they are doing in every facet of the meal.  Over indulged on everything and could do dessert but they sounded great.  One last note - several people told me Joes' has the best fried chicken ever - we didn't try it but a bunch of people around us did - you may want to give it a good - I will stick with the Sea Bass or the Halibut Steak.  Joe's is not inexpensive but it's Vegas - go for it.",

He was attentive without being overbearing.   The food was amazing. The jalapeno cornbread and pretzel bread was out of this world. I was so embarrassed to ask for seconds but my husband did it for me.  We had the octopus appetizer and it was warm and savory over a arugula. Next was the iceberg wedge that had a nice vinigrette at the bottom of the wedge and a creamy blue cheese dressing on top.   CRABCAKE was to die for. Literally the whole thing was crab. No filler, no breadcrumbs, or binder of sort....straight crab. I was blown away how simple and delicious it was.   The entire staff was so nice and friendly. They def know what they are doing here at Joe's. With so many choices in Vegas to choose from I def will say that Joe's is my top place when in Vegas.",

    "text": "Damned Food network channel! i saw the Joes restaurant on TV (the one in Florida) and the vision of the stone crab couldn't leave my mind!!! i took my mom and my husband there. restaurant is located i. the forum shop mall at caesar palace. closer to the strip and across from the starbucks. i made a booking on Open Table. you have the little indoor patio (indoor because inside the mall) and a room that is more casual. menu remain the same one as the back restaurant room that is more chic, elegant and very classic. to access that room i will recommend you to call and make a booking. our waiter was very courteous. as i was going through the menu i had a firework in my brain! everything sound so so delicious. we ordered a nice Moscato bottle to make my mom happy. we ordered some oysters and a clam chowder then some stone crab (large) but honestly go for the small ones. my husband is not a fish or sea food amateur so he got he Porterhouse (come hungry for it). I ordered the steak tartare and mom had a aged chopped steak. we finished our dinner by sharing their famous Key lime pie and some coffee. Food network show made a big deal of the key lime pie - i was disappointed by it. nothing amazing at all just a key lime pie  as much everything was tasty and so good, the dessert was ok, the coffee was just water to me. it didn't taste coffee at all. cherry on top when we saw the check $450 tip not included if you like to have a date night or like to impress someone make sure you know how much it will cost you!  for my first experience at Joe's i enjoyed it even bill was outrageous.",

    "text": "Nothing really \"fancy\" about this place, but it does its steak and seafood justice! They get you in, seated, drinks and breads to your table, server goes over the menu, make your selection, minutes later the food is out, eat, drink, pay bill, leave. You could seriously have a really good surf and turf dinner in under an hour.  The seafood is fresh, easy to get out of the shell (sign of freshness) and best of all...sweet! The steaks; I ordered a petite filet and my wife ordered the bone in filet... both were cooked perfectly (medium rare). Quality cuts of beef! Not sure if they season the beef because they offered us a side of seasoning with our steaks. The seasoning was good, but I wish my filet was already seasoned with this stuff so it wouldn't need it.  The reason why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because that I wish our server had a little more personality. He was such a machine and gave us the feeling of being rushed since he was quick to do everything, including clearing our plates. My wife wasn't really done with her entree and he was ready to clear the table. The whole staff was very efficient and doing their assigned jobs though.  On a side note, my wife didn't necessarily love this place. She said the seafood was good, ceviche was not, she was disappointed in her mashed potatoes and she also thought her cut lacked seasoning (salt/pepper). She compared this place to a better tasting Outback lol",

    "text": "Came here for a destination wedding 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.  The venue held on the second level of the restaurant which was away from the crowd downstairs. It was small yet warm and inviting. When we got there, there was a small menu for us to choose from for the Entree.   The appetizer was a platter of seafood including shrimp, lobster, crab and a shrimp/scallop ceviche. All the seafood was really fresh. This was then followed by a hearty caesar salad.   For the entree, I decided on the Ahi tuna filet on a bed of spinach/mushrooms topped with red wine bordelaise. It also came with some potato cakes as well. Additionally, we also had asparagus and mashed potatoes on the side with our meal. I must say the side of mashed potatoes was definitely my favourite of the night. It was so creamy and flavourful. Of course, the main itself was absolutely delicious! The tuna literally melted in my mouth. My boyfriend had the steak which he mentioned was only alright - he definitely liked my tuna better!   For the dessert I had the chocolate marquise pie. It was okay, nothing too special. I was too full after the main course to even eat the dessert. Overall a very good place to dine at.",

We arrived for an earlier 6:30 reservation, then cooled our heels while the host called \"looking for a deuce\" into his earpiece several times. Several tables were available both outside, and then in the main dining room at this point. Once seated we had excellent service from the tuxedo-clad server, it's nice to have a career server once in a while. It comes at a price, plan on dropping a couple of bills for dinner. King crab (server said it's \"only in season for three weeks\") was quite good, prepared tableside with a server wearing surgical gloves and using scissors. The 22oz. lobster tail was not too much after being steamed and taken out of the shell. Brussels Sprouts just back in season, really sharp and tangy on the balsamic, wouldn't really recommend. Appreciated the complimentary dessert for my birthday. There's a reason the original in Florida has been around nearly a hundred years!",

And we're nowhere near the damn ocean, so this shows how much this restaurant cares about giving you what you pay for.

    "text": "We visited Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 05/24/2015.  Both the food and service were above average.  1 star deduction is due to being seated at 7:40 PM for our 6:30 PM reservation and cold bisque.   The reservation system in a restaurant of this caliber should run more smoothly (in my opinion).  Items ordered and shared:  Crab Bisque: $9.95.  Lump crab brought out in a bowl and the bisque is poured over the crab table-side.  This would have been better if it was hot, but it was cold and cold cream based soup is not the best.  Colossal Lump Crab Cake: $17.95 Mostly crab, hardly any filler and very delectable!  Bread Basket: Dinner roll, onion loaf, soft pretzel stick, olive bread.  The soft pretzel was amazing, but the other breads were just okay.  That was fine with me, it just left more room for all the other marvelous items we had!  1 LB of Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs: Market Price, $59.95 that night.  Fantastic!  Pre-cracked so you just had to gently pry them apart.  Steamed perfectly.  Texture and taste were great, I didn't even need to dip them in butter.  'Select' Stone Crab Claws (6 per order): Market price, $64.95 that night.  These were very good, however they pre-crack the claws before they are brought to you, and the way they were cracked caused the shells to shatter like glass, so it was a little tricky to eat them without chomping on a shell fragment.  Petite Filet (8 oz): $35.95.  Quite possibly one of the best filet I've had in Vegas.  It was cooked perfectly Medium Rare.  Juicy light red in the center with a fantastic crust on top.    Fried Asparagus: $10.95. Because why just have regular old healthy asparagus?  Let's bread it and fry it.  Okay, well, as much as I wanted to mock this when it was ordered, it was freaking amazing.    Joe's Big Daddy Potato: $10.95 (not on the menu, suggested by our waitress).  We tried a couple bites of this, but had so much other delicious items to choose from, that we pretty much neglected it.  It was basically just a loaded baked potato and you can get that anywhere.  Parking note:  If you don't want to walk through Caesar's Forum Shops, you can valet right in front if the restaurant.  Pull in off LV BLVD and instead of going down the hill towards the Forum Shops valet, turn right into the lot with the \"One Way\" sign.  It is super easy and gratis.",

If you prefer a more mild taste-go for it, just wasn't for me.  I will be back next time in search of the \"steak\" that I hear is amazing.    Tips:  Get a reservation at least a week ahead of time or you will miss out on dinner-my bad.",

The reason I am giving them 3 stars and not 5 is because the bar tender offered us to try the stone crab before ordering just to make sure we like it we thought what a nice gesture, we tried it and then we went ahead and ordered it. After paying and leaving him a good tip we left and not until then we checked the bill and found out we were charge for the sample $20, I think that was a little bit dishonest from him, he should've informed us that it was going to be a charge for it.",

Food: Bread basket- great start to the meal since we really liked the bread basket.  We liked the parmesan crisps/sheets, and ended up asking for more.  Stellar Bay oysters- SO Good!  Another reason to visit Vancouver sometime soon.  Perfectly briny and extremely fresh, I could've had a dozen by myself, easily.  Dry aged bone-in rib eye- we asked for medium rare, and it was a little more cooked than we would've liked, but man, was it good.  Tender and juicy, we enjoyed it to our last bite.  Jenni's mashed potates- Can't go wrong with mashed potatoes. Yum.  The star of the meal, stone crabs- Delicious!  Succulent, meaty, and sweet!  Really liked the dipping sauce too.  We ordered the large, and it was 5 big claws for $65.  Pricey?  Yes, but you don't eat stone crabs everyday.  Service:  Very good, no complaints  Decor:  steakhouse decor, we sat outside and it was very nice.  We walked in without a reservation, but the wait wasn't too bad, maybe 20 minutes?    I had been to the Chicago location, and Vegas was comparable.  We walked out stuffed and happy.  Most importantly, birthday boy was very happy.  Success!",

Even though my son told them we were celebrating my birthday dinner we were only offered a seat at a bar table either front where a table was open and had been since we arrived or in the rear dining room. We asked the server to see if we could be seated at a dining table and she went to speak with the Manager. He came out and exhibited a poor hospitality attitude. She had already explained the situation. Instead of just offering dining room seating he said \"Is there something I can help you with?\"  My son explained again that it was a birthday dinner.  He said \"We don't have any seating.  Would you like me to put you down for 10pm? (which was more than an hour later). We declined.  The table in the front was still sitting open. We went to Spago and were treated like royalty.",

For my entree it was between the two Scallop meals. I chose the Seared Sea Scallops with braised pork belly, cabbage and kale. The scallops were fantastic and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delish!!!  Friend ordered the 8oz Petite Filet Mignon and it was cooked a perfect Medium Rare. He was actually ranting and raving about how delicious his steak was for DAYS after and he's had some good steaks in his time!  We also had a side order of Stone Crabs which were delightfully cracked already and DELICIOUS! I don't usually like cold crab but it was SO good.  NOM NOM NOM!!  I just wanted to update that I was here again and sat in the dining room as last time we sat in the bar...

But what i had to appreciate with Joe's was the crisp and timely attention they provide when it comes to service. Water always refilled, used dishes promptly removed, spot on with recommendations, etc. And the food was simple in presentation and solid in quality. Really enjoyed the pretzel bread, their bisque is spot on, steak is cooked well, king crab is fresh...but the highlight is their Havana Creme cake which is similar to. Tres Leches. Our exceptional waiter - Raul - steered me towards that dessert but I only asked for a half slice. To my surprise this was the best creme cake I have ever had bar none. It was quickly demolished by the table so I had to ask for another half slice for myself to enjoy. Raul saw that I enjoyed it so much that he gave me a slice on the house. It's the little things like that which can make a persons day and a customer for life. Count me as the latter when it comes to Joe's and will gladly return as soon as possible.",

The food was all amazing and I'm going to be back here next time I go to Vegas. Well worth the price.",

    "text": "For beinging consider a Fine Dining it fell extremely short. Waiter semed to annoyed or not happy to be there. My wife and I placed our order and soon my wife received her Crab Bisque. After tasting it the soup it was warm and not hot.  My Oyster were fantastic though.  My wife ordered the Seafood Chopped salad and I ordered the Salmon. We received our order in a timely manner, my wife order was correct and had a nice presentation. I looked at my plate and wasn't sure it was the right item but I assumed it was prepared with a sauce that coved it. As I took a bite I realized I received the wrong item. The waiter brought me the Sea Bass. I waved him over and he apologized and then left with the plate. He came back with the Salmon and the Sea Bass. He presented the Salmon to me and said the Chef said I could keep the Sea Bass since I had already taken a bite. As I took a drink from my water glass I noticed it was not clean and had to ask for a new glass. Good thing I had my Jameson to cleanse my mouth.  The Salmon was very enjoyable as I was trying not to let the waiter's lack of service bother one of the 1st night in awhile my wife and I have gone out.  So I really wanted to try the Key Lime and waited for my Waiter to come and take my order. Instead he was more concerned with his other tables to make sure he got their checks to see ehat his tip would be.  As they cleared our plates, finally, I asked for the Key Lime. Most Waiters normally offer desserts, I had to ask. After I ordered he did bring a dessert menu to the other table next to us. They order about 5 mins after my order, 5 minutes later they received their coffee and desserts. Note, I have not received my Key Lime or seen my Waiter.  I finally got up and found my Waiter and cancelled my order and asked for my check. As I get to my table he comes about 2 mins later with my Key Lime in a to go bag and my check. He ended up taking the pie off the bill. Don't know why but still tipped him 20%, worst experience because of the service and good but not great food make for a disliked rating.",

I had never had stone crab before but I have had other people rave to me about it so we tried some as an appetizer with some king crab as well. The stone crab definitely was good, but it was WAY too much work for me and honestly I liked the king crab better. Just a personal preference I guess.  For my entree I had the Filet Mignon and a baked potato. Usually you get separate butter, sour cream and chives with your potato, but they have it all mixed together. I was skeptical when it first arrived, but it was absolutely awesome. We also got the roasted corn for the table. I had never had that before and it was amazing, I couldn't get enough! The filet was also melt in your mouth awesome!  Add a slice of banana cream pie for dessert, which was also incredible, and I was stuffed! I ate at 3 high end restaurants (and 3 medium level spots) during this trip to Vegas, and Joe's was hands down the best!  My only complaint is that I had to walk back to my hotel room. After that much awesome food they really should have golf carts or something to take you back so you can veg out and not have to walk. I will definitely be back!",

To start, I ordered the whale, alaskan crab,  and select stone crab to share. The cerviche was good on the whale, alaskan crab is pretty good too. I never had stone crab before, and I thought it was just ok. Nothing I had missed out on all these years. For my main course I got the branzino, which is just fried fish and too salty. I thought the filet was thicker, a little disappointed on my end. I also tried a bite of my friend's ribeye, which was way too salty. So glad I didn't order it. The hash brown is also nothing special. If you come here, just the get the alaskan crab or the stone crab. This place would be a 3, but 3.5 for the good service.",

And the mash potatoes were phenomenal.The service was awesome, food came out fast, waitress was friendly, etc. my compliant lies with the $80 a piece ribeyes that we paid for that were very sadly disappointing. First time either one of us has had a dry aged ribeye so I don't have anything to compare it to but to us, it was very bland. I don't think the they used any salt, pepper, butter or garlic on the steak. Our waitress even came out with a little bowl of seasoning (that we did not ask for...must be a standard thing). Why do I want to pay $80 for a steak and have to season it myself? Very disappointing, not worth the $211 total bill we paid, the steak wasn't any more tender then something from a regular steak house that only cost $25-35 a steak, and the flavor was just not there. Won't be going back and will not be recommending.",

Joe's was a high point in a weekend of high points, including such dining experience as China Poblano, the Sterling Brunch, and many, many others.  The first impression of any restaurant, whether sit down or casual, is the front desk. Maybe even more so in Vegas. So it was a good thing Thomas was working. Seated right away, birthday congrats, humorous and funny to set you at ease, despite being sharply dressed in a tuxedo. He asked where we were from, joked with us, and had us smiling as he left and the service excellence continued with Lisa, who made a fantastic - and reasonable - wine recommendation. Damned if I can remember, but it was a New Zealand white on their lunch menu. Highly recommend.   The lavoche(spelling?) Was the high point of the bread basket, honorable mention to the pretzel bread. Both excellent.  The oysters Rockefeller was on point. Silky cheese and spinach on perfect oysters. I really didn't things could get better...and then Lisa rolled out the Jumbo stone crab claws. And by Jumbo, I mean the size of my canned-ham fist. Dont stand on ceremony, dig in and suck out every morsel you can, because this is a decadent treat to savor. Dont forget the dipping sauce, as it compliments the crab perfectly.   I cant believe I had room for dessert, but I was hard pressed to say no when Thomas and Lisa came out with this little brownie a la mode dish. I managed to waddle out of Joe's with my dignity largely intact, stomach incredibly full, and a new staple restaurant in Vegas to talk about!",

The reservation was made via Open Table and indicated we were celebrating a birthday. Our server happily talked football with my husband all night but failed to welcome us to the city or acknowledge my birthday celebration.  They were out of stone crab so one of the  main draws to the place was shot off the bat. While I've had superior service there in the past and our service was not bad by any measure, it certainly was not above and beyond or special; I expect more than the status quo service when spending a few hundred dollars on dinner and drinks.  The oysters were available from 3 regions and we tried them all, liking the creamier west coast CA the best, followed by the naked cowboy.  Hubs and I split the filet and sea bass - both excellent and prepared as ordered. We indicated we were splitting both but they were served fully plated and not split - not a big deal but not the extra step (or wasn't offered as I understand perhaps they didn't want to cut into the steak before it hit the table or without asking). Presentation was bland.",

You will never see trash on the floor, staff keep on top of it all. Their silverware is also squeaky clean. They remove dirty plates quickly and always keep your glass full, unless you choose not to. I absolutely love their Stone Crab, something they are known for. Our waiter was Pedro, awesome service, thank you Pedro. We ordered the \"select\" stone crab( about 5 pieces), sauteed broccolini, mac and cheese and or course, big daddy taters. ( bid daddy taters are not on their menu, just ask for it) No drinks just coffee and water. For dessert, a slice of their awesome deliciousness called, key lime pie. The crab was so succulent, so buttery and perfect without any sauce. Their sides you can tell were cooked out of love because of how savory they were. I believe when you cook with love, the food always taste better. Well at Joe's, the staff all love what they do so their great fresh products and their love make for a perfect meal! I'll visit once again when I return to Vegas. Of course, Joe's is a must do if in Vegas, make sure to place a reservation.",

It was a great start to the meal. The fish was really light and cooked so well. There was a light sweet sauce glazed over it and it was a perfect balance. The rib eye!!! OMG THE RIBEYE!!! It was so good. It was juicy and had great flavor!!   I didn't drink the wine, but everyone raves about how delish the wine was. Overall everyone was very pleased with their meal.

    "text": "So we celebrated my sister's birthday here. Made our reservation, and we were seated immediately. Our table was set up in the back of the restaurant. We were seated and water was brought to the table. Menus were handed out. I do not remember the waiter going over the specials, but that was okay.    We had already looked over the menu and had an idea as to what we were going to order.  We had decided to eat family style.   We order a crab bisque, caesar salad, wedge salad, grilled seafood platter, calamari, 32 oz porterhouse; bone in, Chilean sea bass, brussel sprouts, maple pecan yam, mashed potatoes, broccolini, key lime pie, and the banana creme pie.   The crab bisque presentation was nice, chopped veggies in the bowl and the bisque was poured over.  The bisque could have been hotter, it was more on the tepid side.  The veggies were raw, so it added a crunch with every scoop you took.   The wedge salad and caesar were standard. The calamari wasn't crispy, but it was tender. It was almost to the point that the coating was sliding off the squid.   The grilled seafood platter could have been hotter as well, but it was good. The lobster was tasty. The prawns were almost on the verge of overcooked. The scallops were cute and dainty.   The porterhouse, we had sliced off the bone. We asked for medium rare, it came out more on the rare side almost blue in the filet. There were some tough chewy portions. But most of the steak was edible.    The sea bass was delicious. Light and buttery.   I would not order the yam, it was just okay, but if you like sweet sweet, piled on top of more sweet then get this.  Ther was no balance of salt to sweet ratio.   The brussel sprouts were delicious, with the balsamic reduction.  I used that to dip my steak in.  The right amount of tartness.   The broccolini was alright.   Now to desserts, disappointment. Key lime pie was so frozen. It wasn't even fresh. It was frozen to the point that it was like eating ice cream, and it was so hard to bite into. It had almost an artificial flavor to it.  The banana creme pie was tasty. It was light and fluffy.   Sister got a brownie square with ice cream on top. The brownie was not hot or heated, the ice cream solidified it, it was all just really frozen/ ice boxed.   Service was on point. Water was refilled when necessary. Dishes were cleared away with haste. Crumbs were removed from the table.  The meal went by quickly.",

    "text": "Best bone in filet I have had in many years.     We had a table in a back room.  Very private and intimate.  It is an old school wood paneled room that was perfect for our party of twelve.    The service was top notch.  Not a single complaint about the service.  It was top of game.    The appetizers were flat out amazing.  The crabs were the star of the show.  The rest of the apps stood tall as well.    My entree was the bone in filet and it was drop dead amaze balls.  It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious.  It was a work of art and I enjoyed every single bite.    The sides we ordered were also quite good and I could go into detail about them but they were a distant second to my steak.     A few ordered dessert and I had a few bites of a really tasty key lime pie.   This place and the evening was about a perfect as a high end restaurant can be.  If you can afford it, just go here and enjoy.    These guys know what high end VEGAS is all about.",

We started with the calamari, which was good. We also split the wedge salad, which was a little light on bleu cheese and bacon, for my taste.   The bread basket was odd in that it had lots of variety but only one of each. I would have preferred less selection but more than one slice of each.   Dessert was the Havana Dream Pie, a tres leches cake with custard and dulce de leche. Superb.   We would definitely come back here.",

They bring melted butter for you.   The service is awesome, prompt and friendly.   I struggled at first if I wanted a all you can eat buffet or this for my birthday meal- but this will win every time.   You get more for your money in crab and service.  I also had crab soup - which was yummy.  I can not say enough about the service and the food.  Priceless.   Their seafood is flown in daily and you can tell.",

The location is worth finding as it is street level in the Caesars casino located in the forum shops. It's a small section kind of tucked away. Would recommend signage with the restaurant name to help us out.   Back to the meal....I had a surf and turf offering and my husband the bone in filet. Side is creamed spinach-all his as I don't touch it! Baked sweet potato the size of 2 of my hands. Meat was juicy, tender, cooked to our liking. Sides were also tasty-well my potato had butter and cinnamon and pecans. Can't vouch for the greens but he ate them all so there's that!   The second night it was late but we couldn't stop thinking about the shrimp that passed by us. We ordered that and I had the shaved prime rib sand which. We almost cried it was so good!!! Glad we went back. Thinking this will be a stop we always make when visiting. Even though we have one in Chicago that we can't seem to get too!

    "text": "I have been thinking about how to write a review for Joes because I want to do this place justice. It is absolutely my #1 restaurant in all of Las Vegas and this is a place constantly filled and renewed with top notch restaurants.  With that said, Joes NAILED it in every single aspect possible:  Customer service: 10/10 in customer service consistently all the way through from the host to the waiter to the busboys. I make a reservation every time I go and they always manage to get me in immediately no matter how early or late I show up. If i am celebrating an anniversary or birthday, they never hesitate or forget to mention it. One particular incident stood out to me. My friend ordered the large stone crab and then complained that the size of these were the same as the medium sized crabs she got last time. I mean, albeit it was a little smaller than I expected for the large, I didn't expect Joes to do anything about it. I expected them to say sorry, but these are the large claws -- deal w it. Instead, the bus boy did not even skip a beat and immediately responded, no problem I will look for much larger ones for you right away! WHAAAAT! ok thank you!!!   Food: I'll be honest and tell you that this is the only place I've ever had stone crabs so I can't really compare to other stone crabs. HOWEVER, this IS the best crab i've ever had compared any other styles/type of crabs. The star of the show is their signature mustard sauce that you dip the crabs in. Ok, on to their bread basket -- my favorite was the corn bread. I've also had their King Louie Crab salad that was SO good also. I am not usually one to order a stupid salad at any restaurant, but it may be the top 3 salads i've ever had in my life. The portions are hearty and reasonable -- not like those one bite BS you get at those fancy michelin star restaurants. Lastly, the ribeye steak is the absolutely best i've had compared to all the major steakhouses -- ruth's chris, mastros, flemings, mortons, and any other non chain steakhouses. Sorry, Ruth's chris was my #1 for a while...but now it has been dethroned.  Pricing: This is a 5 star restaurant with 2-3 $ prices (on most items). On their signature items like steak and stone crabs, they're exceptional quality with a high value price tag. Is it \"cheap\"? No but it is worth every penny. The other entrees like their au jus sandwich and salads are very affordable. I love that w that kind of range, you can come here to celebrate special occasions  where you wanna drop $$$ but also come here for a random lunch and drop $20.  I love you joes and i'll be back soon!",

Also, this place is a little tricky to get to if you don't know your way around Caesar's.   This easiest way to get here is if you take the metal doors from the \"emergency exit\" between the forum shops and casino on the left side if ur coming from the forum shops. Then you walk down what looks like the employee entrance exit and follow to the left of the hill. Once you reach the forum shops entrance on the ground level, enter through the side entrance and follow the signs to joes. Which is the first restaurant you will see once u enter * (out of breath)  Food is OK I guess. I felt a little tourist trappy here while eating for some reason lol. Not sure why. My wagyu was too fatty for me to enjoy fully and the stone crab legs were hard to eat and had no taste. IMO.  They did provide my friend with a nice bday surprise after with a bday dessert and candle.   Service is what you would expect from a place like this. Very attentive and courteous.",

    "text": "Maintaining 5 stars for Joe's.  I took my parents, sis, and bro-in-law here so we had the opportunity to sample and share more of the menu.  Service was top-notch - all the servers wearing tuxes were attentive and expert at breaking and pre-cutting the king crab legs.  Our main waiter Patrick was awesome and very sociable.  Here's a guide to having an awesome, memorable dinner at Joe's, especially with a party of 6:  1. Have them prepare an appetizer plate with 12 large stone crab claws and 3 king crab legs (break into halves).  Some of the sweetest shellfish you'll ever had, and still having nice texture.  Shells peel off with minimal effort.  When I told my family I booked Joe's at Caesar, they almost expected plastic bibs and wooden mallets.  LOL!  2. Ask for more cornbread!  The pretzel is also good but that cornbread is soft and filled with corn for sweet and jalapeno for heat.  3. Each person orders an entree.  My ahi filet mignon was truly massive, almost the size of a big fist.  Good outer sear and pink, tender center.  Mom got the lighter option with four sea scallops on potato cake.  Wife and Dad each got the Miso-Soy sea bass which was really good this time - still a bit rich but they eased up on the sauce which is good.  Sis and bro-in-law each got the Grilled Seafood Platter which is a solid choice if you want more shellfish: half lobster, shrimp, and scallops.  4. Share a few sides: broccolini (2 orders), sweet potato with praline butter (almost like dessert), and lyonnaise potato (like a gigantic hash brown with caramelized onions on top).  5. Lastly, share some pies for dessert.  We got the key lime (signature dessert) and butterscotch chiffon.  Since we were also celebrating dad's birthday, Patrick sent us a chocolate brownie ice cream cake with a lit candle.  Now that's service!  Be sure to enjoy with espresso or their black coffee.  It was our last dinner of our 3-night Vegas stay.  Between eating at Twist, L'Atelier, and Joe's you could say we went 3 for 3.",

This last time we took some close friends and two people ordered the special.  It was not good!  Over cooked, tough and chewy.  Joe's did make one new steak and comped one steak but not both steaks.  When you pay $60.00 for a steak it needs to be perfect.  Good service but not five star food like we have had in the past.  Disappointed!",

The parmesan bread they serve in the bread basket was made in house, was probably the best item there and it was free.",

We basically stared him down until he felt the heat and made us a table. Or maybe he just loved the fact that we kept commenting how much we loved his fabulous bling bling crab brooch! Haha!  Ok, what can I say about the crab? I'm a seafood and shellfish lover and I haven't yet had bad crab. Hallelujah to that! Yummy in my Tummy! My friend and I got the medium 7 piece. We didn't think it was a lot...but it was! We had to force ourselves to finish it all. Well...in our defense, we ate one too many of the warm soft bread. Darn you Joe for providing fresh baked delicious bread! My other friend got the ribeye. I had a bite and boy was it heavenly! I can still taste it.... Oh...and the key lime pie??? I love key lime pie and if key lime pie is on the menu...It's my Must Have! It was, to me, perfection. It was just enough tang. And the crust? Loved it!!! How can I forget, I love my dessert with coffee. It was greattttt coffee; aromatic, smooth, bold- but not acidic.  Am I the only person who thinks bad cardboard coffee after a great meal ruins the whole dinning experience?",

    "text": "Note to future diners, Joe's is on the opposite end of the Forum shops from where (I think) taxis will drop you off.  We arrived at Joe's a few minutes late, which didn't appear to be an issue. The server approached us quickly to tell us about the specials and take our drink orders. While looking over the menu, he promptly returned with the drinks and a delicious bread basket (I'm pretty sure we would have made a meal just out of bread if we tried). He then took our orders all while being able to respond and come back with equal humorous sarcasm.   Our food arrived promptly and lived up to the expectation of the rating. I got the scallops dish, while there weren't many on the plate for the price, the flavor was outstanding. They were all cooked perfectly and the sauce/topping mixture worked great with the mini potato cakes that came with. My husband got the filet which was cooked perfectly. Normally neither of us are a fan of anything additional they bring to compliment your steak, but a little sprinkle of the seasoning enhanced the flavor of the steak wonderfully. There wasn't a bite left on the plate.  Not knowing how big the side dishes were going to be, we opted to get a sweet potato and creamed spinach. Both were huge! Easily could have been shared among three people assuming everyone had the same sized appetite. Both were really good and left us filling full and satisfied.  I do recommend making a reservation. As we were leaving (around 715PM) the place was packed with a long line of people waiting to get in.",

    "text": "It was Friday night and we were meeting some friends for dinner, the restaurant was packed with both inside and outside seating. DEF RECOMMEND the outside seating- since this location is on the bottom floor of the Entrance off the strip in the Cesars palace- and from the outside seating you get the tourist people watching attraction (strippers, escorts, bridal parties, girls going out in super short dresses)  The best is when sitting outside and the escalator is right there: when a girl in a super short skirt/dress walks by: all I did was watch all the guys try to get a peep. My back was faced toward the gotti shop next door and I knew every time when a girl in a short dress would walk by because every man (husbands and groups of guys) would stop what they were doing to stare at this girl going up the escalator. Super hilarious.  Anyways onto the food:   APPETIZERS *** Assortment of Breads: What seemed like Pumpernickle, a lavosh- 2 kinds- a sesame seed one and another amber colored one (both were delicious), white bread rolls- all served with BIG CHUNKS OF Cold butter- recommendation- Ask for HOT drawn butter and dip your bread into that *** THE Whale (SEAFOOD PLATTER- served cold)- Market value - 4 legs of NON FROZEN Alaskan King Crab -Avacado chunks/mini scallops/small chunks of Shrimp, red and yellow bell pepper with lime juice ceviche -2 lobster tails cut into 4 pieces served cold -jumbo shrimp cocktail ------The Whale comes highly recommended as per our waiter, the seafood on this platter is never Frozen.   DINNER 1)green salads: very large portions with a light vinagrette 2)select stone crab (6 pieces): not recommended- yet it comes pre cracked and easy to eat but you can tell it is frozen. The meat on the inside was hearty but still lightly frozen and it just wasnt as sweet as the alaskan King crab legs 3) side of creamed spinach ($8.95)- NOT RECOMMENDED- tasted almost like it went bad- like sour milk- barely ate it and almost returned it 4) Filet mignon- 12 oz- $47.95- cooked rare plus- very tiny for the price 5) Filet and tail- ( 6ox Filet and 10z Atlantic Fire Grilled Lobster tail served with Drawn butter -Very small lobster tail after its been fire grilled and truthfully much better served cold in the whale platter  DESSERT 1)Key Lime Pie- their most recommended dessert -super super high quality lime taste, very tangy and refreshing with grahm cracker crust. Very buttery and delicious 2) Coconut Cream Pie- very sweet, creamy filling with whipped cream and shreads of dried coconut- not as good as the Key Lime Pie  Overall, the quality of food was EXCELLENT- Our server Steven was very high class and polite and prompt. He even saw that we were struggling with the dessert but knew we wanted some so he brought out the Key Lime Pie at No Charge.  Although the service and quality of food was excellent- the price point was super high- Dinner for the 4 of us was close to 500$. Not an everyday place but will come back for a special occasion.",

We also ordered the ahi tuna steak, grilled seafood platter, fried seafood platter, a pasta dish along with 4 different sides. The ahi tuna steak was lovely & was the hit of the entire meal. :)  Unfortunately, the stone crabs were nothing to write home about.  :(  From a value perspective then I would say it could have been better. 1 order of select stone crab is $30 or said in a different way, each stone crab leg is $15. All the entrees were $5 higher than what I would expect for the quality & quantity of the food provided. :(   Total cost was $500 for a party of 4 that included 2 alcoholic beverages, stone crab appetizer, 4 entrees, 4 sides, and no desserts. :(  If you show your Total Rewards players card then you'll receive a 10% discount but only for half your bill. We were told by management that a 10% discount is not provided on the entire bill.

The stone crab was cracked for you so that you don't have to deal with opening it over and over again. The sides are good too, so do not miss. What I liked about this place is that it's actually more approachable and casual than some of the other restaurants which are more for sitting down and leisure meals. Here you can get great service and a totally unusual food. And the service was expeditious so that you can go back to the hotel room to work.   Granted, this is Vegas. Calvin Trillin, the esteemed columnist from New Yorker once said that during Trump era, where many liberal elites wake up in panic, he practices counting shrimps consumed in Vegas to calm himself down. Vegas does have some odd eats. Who could have thought Vegas is the shrimp consumption capital? There are more shrimps eaten in Vegas than anywhere else in the world. I really think we should look into stone crab consumption as well.   We had a fantastic meal here. I was lucky to be taken here. We took our leisurely walk back to the hotel. A great eatery. Fantastic companion. Excellent choice of dining establishment when in town. Do not miss.",

First of all, like other reviews say, you must do the stone crab. If I remember correctly, we ended up ordering more after our first serving as it was so delicious. I did the filet and tail for my entree and the lobster was prepared perfectly as was the filet. It is extremely hard to get a table so reservations are a must.",

Stone crabs, stone crabs and more stone crabs.   The stone crabs are awesome. Our bill was expensive at $310 with tip.  We did have 4 drinks which pumped it plus dessert.   You gotta eat here. One of the best in Vegas.",

    "text": "Excellent service is what shines here.  It's rare that I give anyone five stars, but this place sets the stage for how customer service is meant to be handled. From start to finish the personal touch and extra mile are why this restaurant is one of the best around.  I've been to the Miami location (if indeed they are linked), and the original spot could learn a thing or two from this location. We were seated immediately, and given the usual list that all restaurants meant for this caliber use. The specials announced, the favorites communicated, and this seafood connoisseur had a hard time picking from all the items listed on Joe's menu. Also note that if you are saving pennies, then this menu isn't for you. Captain D's down the street would love to have you. This restaurant is for serious diners only. Don't complain.  The initial breads were good, but not great. Both the cornbread and pretzel breads were just OK, but that's not why I'm here, right? I'm here for sea-critters cooked in a variety of ways, so bread be damned. The crab bisque is served two-part, which allows the solid ingredients to stay together instead of being cooked into oblivion which adds a nice touch. Order it.  The crab and lobster dishes were cooked to perfection, and everyone from our group lauded their choices, and smiles were had once I was finished making a mess with my stone crabs. You can never have enough sea-critters murrrrrrrrrr'natin' in butter to satiate this fat-kid's needs, so order more than you need. It's the American way.  All-in-all, I can't see myself coming here more than once a month due to my dwindling paycheck, but a few times a year? You bet. Our service was on-point the entire night, and this alone is why I would save those pennies I talked about earlier to come back.",

    "text": "It had been about two years since I last went to Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab, so I guess you can say I was way overdue for some epic Stone Crab Claws.  We went here for a late lunch.  So because I was dining with a group this time, I got to try more food shared by others around the table.  I got to try their Hashed Brown and Fried Asparagus. Both were good and had surprisingly huge portions for side dishes.  I don't have any pics of them unfortunately, but the Hashed Brown was interesting since it was shaped like an armadillo.  The last two visits here had me ordering their Large Size Crab Claws.  This time around I was little more frugal and opted for the Select Size Crab Claws (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iy9cdN&s=6dcc4fca432af7c5dffbaffddaccf5da9ce938f9a5b6b94ca8a23aac8b5be2e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iy9cdN</a>).  Even though it was just slightly smaller and one more claw than the Large Size, Select Size was still a good portion size.  But there was definitely a lot more labor involved in removing the shells.  Nonetheless, it was still enjoyable and I love dipping the sweet crab meat in Joe's signature mustard sauce.  There's no doubt about it.  Joe's Stone Crab claws are still as delicious and indulgent as ever.  As for the restaurant, I think it's still a great spot for special occasions, or simply if you're just craving Stone Crab.",

I ordered the lunch special which came with five medium stone crabs, hash brown potatoes, coleslaw, and a slice of key lime pie.  It was a lot of food for $35 and a very good value considering Joe's prices.  The stone crabs were very fresh and tasty with the famous mustard sauce.  I liked the tangy wet cole slaw with slices of tomato.  The hash brown potatoes had a crunchy, deep fried crust and was a very generous serving.  I hardly put a dent in it.  The key lime pie was enjoyable even though I was so full.  Joseph, a fellow SoCal native, was the server and he was so nice, friendly, and engaging.  He was very attentive and personable.  I don't see myself visiting the Joe's in Miami anytime soon, so until my next visit to Vegas, I'll keep craving and dreaming about the stone crabs.",

    "text": "Let's face it.  If you want a steak in Vegas, a seafood place wouldn't be your first pick.  However, Joe's combines the best of both worlds. Made a reservation for a Monday night while attending a conference in Vegas.  The place was crowded.  Seating in the front (outside in the Forum shops), in the middle of the restaurant with the bar, and more intimate dining in the back.    Ordered the Caesar salad to start - nothing fancy (which is a tad ironic considering the place is located in Caesars Palace.)  Since the stone crab is so famous, also ordered some to try.  Some roasted corn on the side was a recommendation from the waiter.  And for the main course, a dry-aged bone in rib eye steak.    The stone crab was good - not as sweet as I had imagined.  Then again, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I get spoiled by dungeness crab.  But good nevertheless.  The steak was fantastic!  Cooked perfectly.  Seasoned perfectly.   The bone-in adds so much flavor.  Superb quality.  And the corn was really delicious with a smoky, peppery flavor.      To top off the meal, I had to try their key lime pie which someone had said they fly in from Florida.  Not having been to Florida and not sure if this rumor was True, this was still the best key lime pie I've ever tasted.  Would really love to come back to Joe's someday.  Great experience and excellent food.",

    "text": "Yum. Yum. Seafood. and Steak. Yummy in my Tummy.  I've been wanting to go to Joe's ever since I saw it featured on Giada's Weekend Getaways (although that was the Miami location).  I wanted to come here for dinner, and we had some trouble finding reservations on a Friday night (then again, probably shouldn't have tried to make reservations that day). We ended up taking a 5:30 spot, which is, not surprisingly, when they open up for the dinner service.  We ordered the Stone Crab appetizer, the crab cakes, and the rib eye steak. While waiting for our meal, we were served a basket of different types of bread. Hands down, the little pretzel bread was my absolute favorite.   We were served the our appetizer, and we dived into the four claws that we were served.  They were soo good, succulent, and with a sweeter flavor than you find in the dungeness crabs I normally eat in LA.  The mustard dipping sauce was really good too; definitely not too mustardy. I would actually call it more of an aioli.    Our entress were delectable as well. I ordered the crab cakes, and my eyes popped open when they were served I was expecting a couple disk-shaped cakes, but these were no mere disks, but MOUNDS.  The cakes had practically no fillers to it, but was just all sweet, delicious crab.  The steak was amazing as well.  It had a delicious, almost salty crust to it, and it was perfectly cooked. It brought to mind that I haven't had a good steak in, well, a long time.  We ate every bit of food on our places (despite being extremely full), and walked out of the restaurant with that feeling where you're happy from the awesome meal you just ate, mixed with the uncomfortable, slightly lethargic feeling you get from just eating way too much.",

Friday evening I went back to Joe's and went to valet. Well my sunglasses were stolen. This was there second strike. I know you might think of she probably lost them, but I assure you they were in the car.

I love crabs in general, but there is something about stone crabs that I'm not going to go out of my way and pay for it myself, but if you have never had one, then you should probalby try it.  Their huge seafood platter with stone crabs, ceviche, prawns, lobsters are excellent especially the ceviche.

We got the stone crab claws as an appetizer which were just okay but for $60 for a few tiny claws, it wasn't worth it. I had the seared scallops which were dry and not flavorful. Even the brussell sprouts were every dry and unflavorful. This place really misses the mark!",

I don't know, nor want to know how much butter they put in those potatoes but they were sooooo good. The service was excellent as well. Our waitress gave us the perfect amount of attention and the food came out quickly and as ordered. However, I was really impressed with Brianna, the private dining manager. I had to make reservations for a group of 12 dudes on a bachelor party and she was very responsive, within minutes to my emails and questions about the different options. Being the best man it was important that the dinner went as planned. I also loved that our table of 12 was promptly ready as planned on a Saturday during prime time hours on opening football weekend. I really hate when restaurants take reservations but make you wait because they gave your reservations to someone else. What's the point of reservations then? Anyhow, if you booking for a large group at Joe's, work with Brianna, she is awesome.",

    "text": "I have passed this restaurant on every visit to the Forum Shoppes.  Never thought once to eat there, as I have never been a fan of eating in the mall.  After reading all of the positive comments from fellow Yelpers and on Opentable, I finally decided to give it a shot.    The host/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  He is perfect for his position.  He welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as I was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  Cozy setting on the inside.    Was I wrong about this place.  It was so freakin' good.  The first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  There was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  I was impressed.    We had to try the Stone Crab - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  You can order as many as you want.  Don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  She said it fell off the shell better.  It was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  I am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.    We had the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the Caesar Salad next.  Both were also very good.  I had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  It was a special of the day.  It was cooked to perfection.    The best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  You can order a 1/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  But the best dessert was the Peppermint Ice Cream with the Hot Fudge.  Hot Dang!!!!  This was the best ever.....  This hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.    Service was very attentive.  Waters and Lemonade always filled.  Dirty dishes removed promptly and the server was nice and friendly.  I am so happy I finally tried this place out.  It took me long enough, but I will be going back again.",

He had a party of 6 sested at the table next to us, and he certainly gave them more attention than he did us, to top it off, he even brought out a dessert with a candle and said \" I know it's not your birthday or any other celebration, but this is for you\"!!!!! I guess our check amount wasn't high enough to warrant attentive service, I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special occasion, lucky for us we enjoyed some other amazing meals on our trip. We love Mesa Grill in Ceasars Palace, Cut had amazing food, Spagos was amazing, and all customers were treated equal. I gave this pretentious dining establishment 2 stars because the food was good, and once we asked the female helper for a warm wash cloth and lemon so my husband could clean up after his grilled seafood platter, she showed some care for our table. Our server was Daniel Z and I suggest if you get seated in his section, and you plan on spending $120.00-$150. 00 for dinner for two, ask for a different server that's probably not enough for you to get the expected service one should get from a place like this.",

That didn't bother me, but if you like your steak rare, you might just want to ask for it \"really rare\" or bloody. The crab claws were exquisite. They pre-crack them just perfectly for you so you can easily pick out all the sweet, succulent meat. The flavor and texture of the crab really is outstanding. Sweet and tender, and that slight bounce with every chew. Getting seated for the 3 of us was easy although we dined at 4pm. The main restaurant tables were taken, but there was space at the tables in the bar. I love going to joes wether it's in Vegas or Miami! It's always delicious and always special.",

    "text": "It's been a long time since I've had a really good, knock off my boots and keep them off!!!, ribeye.  This place really surprised me with the quality of their steak since it's mostly famous for it's stone crab.  -bone-in ribeye:  Yah, I splurged for the bone and honestly, I don't know if it would've made a difference.  I've noticed with other places that the meat next to the bone is usually a bit more tender than the rest of the steak but it really didn't matter here.  Every piece of meat I ate was just as good as the last. -dover sole:  This thing was A-MA-ZING!  Cooked perfectly and the brown butter sauce on the side was so decadent.  My only gripe about this dish is that they took the belly, and all the tasty little bones away =(  My little heart cried when the waiter took that platter away ='((( -swordfish with mint pesto:  This was a special that night and it was overcooked.  My friend really should've sent it back for a new one but she didn't.  The presentation was lovely though. -creamed spinach:  This was very good.  It had a good spinach flavor and wasn't overloaded with cream. -Jennie's potaoes:  Honestly, I don't see the draw of this dish.  It was just whipped potatoes and it seemed to have lacked butter and salt in it. -mac and cheese:  This was okay, loved that they used shells though =d -oysters on a half shell:  Their shucking skillz weren't too bad.  Only about 3 of the 12 oysters on the plate were stabbed to death and I had some shell shards in 1 of my oysters so that was good.  They were offering French Kisses and Kushis that night.  The Kushis defintely stole the show with a slight sweet buttery taste to them.  They also come with little Tabasco bottles that are uberly cute!  And a migonette, which was nice but a tiny spoon to get the liquid onto the oysters would've been greatly appreciated hah! -brownie a la mode:  This was a tasty brownie.  I don't normally like brownies but this brownie was amazing mmmmmmmm  All and all, I would definitely come back here when their stone crabs are in season and splurge all over again =)",

You can valet right outside the mall and walk directly to the restaurant. Next lets talk about the food. Always excellent. The steaks are cooked just the way you order. I really enjoy the Mahi tacos and Chilean sea bass. Seafood is fresh, no fishy smell or taste. Ive also had the ribeye cheesesteak. I must say simply wonderful sandwich. Now the caveat is you are going to pay for such good food, be prepared to spend some cash",

If you love crab/crab cakes please consider ordering this!      - Scallop potatoes - 6/10 these were ok a bit over cooked but still not bad      - Creamy spinach - 8/10 really good but nothing to write home about      - Steak - 8/10 petite filet paired with a lobster tail was yummy no complaints here. the filet had a nice crust and yet was still tender. Good job! The lobster tail was one of the best that I have had. It was good in size and was tender! Nice to finally find a place that does not over cook the lobster.      - Keylime pie 9/10 - no explanation here other than...good lawd I wish I had a piece right now...LOL The crust was perfection and the pie had the right amount of tart/sweet.      - Lemon drop martini - 10/10 I wanted to gulp it down like a glass of water but since I was out on a date with the man I love and in public...I didn't. :-) It was sooo good!   Summary: Will definitely dine here again. They are superior at seafood and good at steak. If you are a surf and turf fan like I am then this is the place for you. If you are purely a steak connoisseur like my fiance then you may prefer Craft at the MGM. I enjoy both so this was a great choice.   Recommendation: Probably a good idea to make a reservation. The resturant was packed yet the staff never made us feel rushed. I made our reservation and we were seated upon arrival.   Hope this review is helpful friends~",

While visiting City of Sin we had a lovely lunch on the \"outdoor\" patio of Joe's, watching all the shopper's go by, certainly jealous of the beautiful seafood dishes being piled on our tables :-) Joe's gets pretty busy and therefore I highly recommend reservation.   The service was impeccable along with terrific food and great selection. It was an all around great experience.   Upon arrival server brought us Bread basket, The bread basket comes with at least five different kinds of bread. The pretzel rolls and onion rolls were outstanding.  As far as food goes, Server suggested we should try the SEAFOOD Chopped Salad (she promised we won't be disappointment) and Oh my goodness was she right. It was the best Seafood Salad I have ever tasted and the price was just right vs most of the other selections on the menu (ONLY $18.95)   We also tried the Colossal Lump crab cake which was beyond tasty and a bowl of Crab Bisque so creamy and good.   I highly recommend Joe's!!! You won't be disappointed!",

Don't get me wrong, the wait staff was WONDERFUL, which is why I'm giving them 3 stars, but the food was just ok.  I may be a seafood snob because I'm from New Orleans and we have wonderful seafood restaurants here, but this one was just barely ok in my opinion.  If you're from bland food areas, such as the the Mid-West, California, Iowa, Colorado....areas of that part of the US that doesn't get to experience great seafood most of the time, this would probably be a great seafood restaurant.",

In Vegas I feel like service should be 5 stars, especially because of the prices you are paying. Made reservations weeks before our arrival and I'm wishing I would of picked a different place. We ordered two appetizers and only got one. It wasn't even acknowledged we didn't get the oysters we ordered. Definitely feel like because we weren't dropping a grand and ordering everything on the menu we were second rate. Didn't help the waitress was talking bad about people from the Bay Area to the table just across from us. Booked as an anniversary dinner and got a happy birthday brownie with a candle. No attention to detail. Waitress had a bad attitude and definitely put a damper on our last night and for a very special occasion. Pretty disappointed!!!",

Lunch had a casual, laid back atmosphere with no dress code. I saw a few people wearing swim shorts and flip flops. The decor is what you'd expect from a steak house. We were seated at the high tops in the bar area. Our waiter was fast and courteous. We ordered the Medium Stone Crab, Seafood Pasta, Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Corn. The pasta was really good. It had a mild pesto sauce (which was a pleasant surprise not mentioned on the menu). There was a decent amount of lobster, crab and shrimp. They didn't skimp there. It was extremely tasty! The stone crab was also really good. We got the traditional mustard sauce and drawn butter for dipping. I liked the mustard sauce best! Lastly the bread basket everyone raves about. They give you a nice assortment. Our favorite was the pretzel and cheese crisp. We'll definitely be back!",

We were able to make a reservation for 10 the day of on pretty short notice, which I thought was great, since when we got there it was completely packed. I am a huge seafood lover so I was pretty stoked to try the stone crab.  The Service: The service we received from start to finish was really great, and definitely gave you the white glove type of feeling you want when you are eating expensive food. Our waiter did a great job catering to everyone's tastes and even able provide a vegan option (an awesomely crafted cauliflower steak) for a couple people in our group that were vegan. He was also great in making sure no one had to wait for drink refills, and made great wine recommendations. I was set on ordering stone crab as an entree and he was able to talk me through the correct amount to order and explain to me how to eat them. The service was great and what I would expect from a nice steak + seafood place.  The Food:  They bring out a variety of breads at the beginning of the meal, from biscuits to flatbread and everyone seemed pretty pleased. We ordered the spinach mushrooms for an appetizer and we were really impressed by the size of the appetizer and how great the mushrooms tasted. My husband ordered the New York strip for the main course, which was great and we both enjoyed the flavor. I thought the stone crab was okay, but I was wishing I had just ordered the king crab. I ended up with 2 jumbo claws, and while I thought this was definitely enough food for an entree, it was a lot of work to remove the shells and I ended up having to pick some shell shards out of my mouth in the process. I am not sure it was worth the trouble, because I didn't find anything particularly amazing about stone crab, but it tasted fine to me. We also ordered some potatoes Louie which I would not recommend because it was like a large fried ball of diced potatoes with onions on top, and didn't have too much taste. Everyone at our table seemed to like their meals - one raved about the scallops, and the lobster tails were a big hit. Also everyone loved the Mac and cheese side!  Overall this was a great place to go with a large group, and the service was fantastic. They catered to specific dietary needs which was great, and the menu was diverse enough to keep everyone happy.",

We love crab and were thinking about ordering the stone crab but read that it was cold and we both like our crab warm so we passed on that. My husband got the Alaskan King Crab Lunch special and I got the filet lunch special. We also order a crab cake as an app.   Crab cake app was outstanding. It was the best I have ever had, so juciy  and really good sauce as well.   The crab legs came out and they were cold. We didn't know this before hand, we should have asked. Husband starting eating them but was gross out by them so he and I switched. Prior to switching I did have some steak and it was very good. I really enjoyed the seasoning they give you. I ate the crab and while I didnt enjoy the cold part the meat was good and I ate it all. They give you a lot of sides. We got 2 different potatoes. Husband liked the one a lot but I didnt like either. I ate the sweet corn like mad though, that stuff was amazing. I didnt really like the grilled tomato.   Dessert was great. I got the banana cream pie and he go the cuban cake or something like that. Both were most excellent. I do wish they had fountain soda instead of bottled, I like my free refills.   Overall good experience but I will pass on the cold crab and go for steak all around .",

    "text": "It's hard to pick a place to eat in Vegas, because there are so many options! This one was easy, we wanted seafood and we were walking around The Forum Shop at Caesars. We ended up going with Joe's.   It was still fairly early at noon for lunch, which I'm sure half the town isn't even awake yet. We didn't have reservations, but there were plenty of tables available. The service was great, our server was fun, personable, attentive and sweet. We asked a bunch of questions about the Stone Crabs, since I've never heard of them. And they were really good at explaining what they were, how they were prepared and even brought out all the different crabs and sizes for us to pick the right order.   We tried the stone crab, medium size with 7 claws to an order at $39.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lJ0pQBaB2fgsDagflH1AGg&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The stone crabs were delicious. Already cracked, easy to peel and dipped in a tangy creamy horseradish sauce. Also from reading the menu, they explained a bit about the crab claws, how they are harvested and then released back in the wild, and apparently the claws grow back. I had no idea.   We also tried an order of Rockefeller Oysters, which were also very good.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=T3GL3566MoyyKhPu0WFvsw&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Main dish was the lobster wrapped in sole. I am a big fan of sole, so I just had to try this one. It was also very tasty, with some wonderful mushrooms and tomatoes on top to garnish.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=yfCESqL7zm7byTlE9jUdww&userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Along with the fish, we had a small side order of wild mushroom mac n cheese. It was very creamy, but just a tad bland for my taste.   All in all, the bill came out to about $100 for all the food. I came out stuffed with seafood. And it was a very pleasant meal. No complaints here! I would definitely come back and try more of the meats next time around.",

    "text": "Great upscale restaurant!!   While planning a great trip to the lovely Las Vegas area, Joe's crossed my list as one of the top places to eat--thanks to my fellow yelpers! I wanted to impress the hubby with a romantic dinner and amazing steak. And after much debt-- I decided Joe's would be it!  Let me say if you come in the main entrance of the Caesars Palace you are jacked and I hope you have on comfortable shoes! The restaurant is on the far end of the hotel and located in the shopping and eating plaza of the hotel. Make sure you ask somebody if you are not sure, or you will get an amazing amount of exercise before you eat. After our long hike from the beginning of the hotel to the restaurant, we finally made it to JOE'S (AHHHHH*** angel music in the background). There was a gentlemen hostess outside the restaurant behind a booth --who was taking seating request for people as they came up to the restaurant (there was a wait). Luckily for the hubby and I, I made reservations a few days in advance. The host escorted us into the restaurant and into a second check in area and a second dining room area for those who made reservations. This area was kind of sectioned off and I felt very exclusive! After the second host confirmed our name we were immediately seated. The set up and decorations of Joe's is so upscale, I felt like I traveled back in time to the early 1900s and dining at the classist establishment in Vegas. The lighting is dim and romantic and the waiters all wear full tuxedos.   The hubby and I were seated in a cushiony booth and immediately given water and bread from the sub server. After a couple of minutes our waiter made his way to our table and went through the menu and what the day's specials were. I placed an order for a glass of wine and the hubby ordered water (not sure what wine I ordered--its Vegas and I had a few before I got there). The wine was very good-- I do know that much. Everything sounded so good on the menu, I couldn't decide what to order. I ended up ordering the King Crab Louis Salad and the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs. The hubby ordered the filet mignon steak. The salad was so amazing and fresh! It was the best crab salad I have ever had! The Jumbo crab legs I could have gone without-- the market price was 20 or 30 bucks and I only received like a piece of 2 legs--it looked like an appetizer--but I guess that's what is served at upscale places. We also ordered a side of steamed asparagus and mac and cheese. Everything was just amazing and mouth watering and our server was on point from the time we came till the very end of our meal. My husband's water was never empty and we were completely tended to by the waiter and the servers. His steak was also made to perfection and very juicy. This was an excellent restaurant and I will def. go again when I visit the Vegas area. The waiter also informed us there is a location in the DC area, so I may not have to wait long before I try this great place again!",

    "text": "I love crab.  Blue, King, Alaskan Snow, Dungeness, and now Stone Crabs.  I came here last year and decided to refresh my memory.  I'm glad I took that long walk from my room at Caesars to Joes.  We had a dozen of the oysters, their world-famous scallops, the shrimp and scallop ceviche and of course the stone crabs.    The oysters were smaller than the ones that I am used to eating.  But these oysters tasted a whole lot better.  It came with a cocktail sauce and another one that looked like italian dressing.  Just eat it without the sauce.  It's that good.  Their world famous scallops were very good.  Very sweet and buttery.  Nice texture to them also.  Get them.  The ceviche was alright.  A little to acidic for my taste.  I don't think I would order that again.  Now onto the reason we came here, the stone crabs.  We got the Select stone crabs.  6 to an order.  Our server said the different types were just the size of the claws, not the taste.  She said all the orders usually come out to a pound.  Might as well get the bigger claws which make it easier to get the meat and eat.  It came with Joes mustard sauce but I just squeezed some lemon juice on them and it was perfect.  Winner!  Our server was really helpful and cheery.  We could joke around with her and she joked back.  Our glasses never went dry.  Very attentive here.  I think I'll make this a regular stop every time I come to Vegas.",

The Stone Crab is the star - and may I say, OMFG. I recommend the medium sized option (arguably more flavorful than the large ones) - about $30 for seven, enough to feed two to three as an appetizer.   Each claw is about the size of a thumb. The meat - perfectly chilled and just the right bounciness in the bite. The dipping sauce - creamy, tangy, flawless.  Everything else - The fish, salads, Stone Crab Bisque, steaks, the impeccable service - all top notch. I've visited the Chicago mothership several times and can vouch that the Vegas version stays True to the quality of its brand.  Forget about celebrity chefs and impossible wait lists, go to Joe's and feel like a KING!",

I got the 12oz filet, and it was spectacular.  One of the best steaks I've ever had, and at a very reasonable price.  I also had a crab claw, hashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and sweet corn.

    "text": "Put simply, this is a very good restaurant.  I ate in the main dining room and I recommend that over being in the front \"bar\" area.  FOOD When in Rome, so I had the Stone Crab.  After that decision had been made, I looked for other accompanying dishes and found a few gems.  The bread basket had 6 different & delicious breads - my favorite being the pretzel that is pictured here on Yelp. The cup of Crab Bisque was buttery with just the right amount of salt - probably could have a whole bowl.  The Caesar Salad had just the right amount of dressing although wasn't something I couldn't have gotten elsewhere.  The Select Stone Crabs were meaty & tasty as was the mustard sauce it came with.  The Hashed Browns were just okay and probably a lot more than I needed.  (And that was a HALF order)   And the coffee was brewed very well - no bitterness in there at all.  Bread basket:  4/5 Stone Crab Bisque:  5/5 Caesar Salad:  4/5 Select Stone Crab Entree:  4/5 Side Hashed Browns:  3/5 Coffee:  4/5  SERVICE My server, whom I know the name of however I will refrain from using it because of the comment at the end of this review just in case, was genuinely as good as it gets.  Prompt.  Informed.  Courteous.  Friendly.  Accommodating.  This is frankly as good as I can expect without him comping my whole meal.  He advised adjustments to the portion size of my orders (\"half orders, sir\") to ensure that I'd have room for everything.  The staff was Johnny-on-the-spot with every plate and the bussing was prompt enough.  My glass was almost always full and I never had to ask for the check or the status of a dish.  ATMOSPHERE This is a beautiful restaurant, with an air of class and a bit of authority.  The folks in the main dining room know that the immediacy of service is important as is knowledge of the dishes so the people that work there seem focused on making sure people get the right dish for their tastes and they are all dressed the part.  Make no mistake, this is a more formal restaurant expecting a relatively nice dress code.  Not exactly \"coats mandatory\" but jeans on men at least are probably discouraged.  Slacker attire does stand out amongst the well dressed servers, dark wood booths, incandescent lighting, and draperies.  VALUE $65 for everything above sans tip.  Not bad at all, and that was with the higher end \"Select\" Stone Crab.  The reason you might buy the \"Select\" Stone Crab is to get larger claws so that you spend less time shelling the cracked claws and more time eating the big beefy morsels.  CONCLUSION I'll be back for certain.  It's not quite at that \"irresistable\" level however it definitely warrants several return trips - especially with the wifey.  Another thing:  This restaurant doesn't belong in the Forum shops - it's too classy and deserves better than the be across from a \"Sony Style\" retail shop.  They ought to pull up roots and move to the Palazzo where Sheldon Adelson could use a good restaurant with good value.  ---------------------- Humorous exchange of the night: KURT:  Do you have sparkling water? SERVER:  Yes sir, we do. KURT:  [sternly] It isn't Perrier, is it? SERVER:  [quietly] Are you joking, sir? KURT:  You just made your 15%.  Onward to 25. SERVER:  [nodding] Very good, sir.",

    "text": "I am a huge seafood fan, so when it comes to seafood I want the best quality.  I will pay good money for that quality too!    The seafood here is too good to be True.  I went there this past weekend for my Valentine's dinner.  We had the medium order of Stone Crab, and the order of King crab legs.  The stone crab is kind of tedious to eat since the meat really sticks to the shell, but it tastes so fresh, you will want to make sure you get every single piece of meat off the claws.  The sauce it comes with is very flavorful too.  MM hmm..to die for!  The king crabs....are definitely KING.  They're huge!  They are not your average size crab legs you find in the buffet.  These are like 1 inch in diamater thick crab legs.  They come pre cracked so you don't have to deal with cracking them yourself.  Instead, enjoy them with your bowl of drawn butter.  So fresh, so good, so meaty, and well worth the $60 you'll pay for them.    For sides, we had the steamed asparagus, and the pan roasted corn. The asparagus was bland, but the corn was delicious!  I've never had pan roasted.  I like the texture!  For dessert we had the havana dream pie and a cappucino.  The pie was super tasty and yummers.  A little too much custard, but I like the white cake it lays on.  So good!  Cappucino was of course excellent.   Nice atmosphere as well, with nice wait service.  The maitre'd was super nice too.  I recommend this place for a fancy date dinner if you both love seafood.  I had a great time there! =)",

Apparently, this is the highest grossing restaurant in the Caesars Forum Shops. I can see why.   I had the blackened mahi mahi sandwich which was also very good with a side of cole slaw.   I heard the peppermint pie? is really good have yet to try, but will return.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "First of all, LUNCH. Surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the Strip: Joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu).   A spin-off of the Miami legend, Joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant Forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (I also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the Strip and a elegantly old school \"Boardroom\" for private dining/meeting).  Coat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. It isn't surprising to run into both Casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. Tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.  The menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected stone crab claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, shrimp dejonghe (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), crab cakes and fish dishes, there is an excellent Chopped Vegetable Salad, good garlic creamed spinach and roasted corn.  The bone-in filet mignon was among the very best I've had in Vegas. And I have to tell you that I have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.  Our Dover Sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously sauteed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).  The fried chicken was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. Savory but light.  In season, the Alaskan king crab legs here are far and away the best I've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab.   Their pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. I have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when I complained.   Generally speaking, prices are on the high side but the quality reflects that. Order with care.",

But, after this experiance --- if I go back, maybe the Large Size is the only way to go for better quality.    My favorite salad there is the BLT -- Very Yum and they are always nice to split it for me and my husband. --- and the sides are always good --- creamed spinach and lyonaise potatoes!  They also have some reasonable price wine by the bottles that are very good.   I just wish the crab was more crab-a-licious.....",

The dining area looked full and we didn't have reservations. We thought we'd have to wait a while, which was no problem. We got seated right away. The seating is divided into 3 sections ( the faux patio, bar area, and main dining area). We sat in the bar area which I actually preferred.   We each ordered a ribeye with creamed spinach and lyonnaise potatoes.  The steak was the best I've had so far! It was like I was eating addiction! No joke! I've had steak from Ruth's, Morton, Smith and...., and numerous other places. This was numero uno! They also provided a tiny tin of their house seasoning salt. I'd forget about the high blood pressure anytime they'd bring this out.! It made the steak that much better! Just be conservative with it. What else looked amazing was the plate of stone crab the couple next to us ordered! I thought they'd taken those claws off some monster in a Godzilla movie. That's on the realz, homie.   Our server was always on point. Like she was a Pre-Cog from Minority Report.   I'm in Vegas several times a year, so best believe that if I'm in town and I'm craving a steak, I'm bustin' in on Joe's.

    "text": "Beginning to end, I was highly impressed with Joe's and had one of the best meals I have had in a long time. The host seated Craig and me outside on the patio, in a great location where we could people-watch.   The free bread basket is artfully arranged and comes with 5 varieties of rolls and bread. My favorite was a thick, chewy pretzel stick....when I asked for another one our server brought us 3 more which I totally appreciated.   It was about 100 degrees outside, and I was chugging water like a parched camel. They were wonderful about refilling our glasses quickly, and they brought me a little bowl of lemons to put in it.   Although the bottle wine list is extensive, I  was the lone drinker at my table so a bottle was out of the question; I wish they had a few more options for single glasses. The Pinot Gris I tried was fairly good and paired nicely with my food, but it was the only option for Pinot Gris.I am not a huge fan of Chardonnay so I would have liked a few more options of Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, etc.  The food was amazing though, which is why it still gets 5 stars. Craig is an unfortunately picky eater, but he absolutely gobbled up his steak sandwich. It came out beautifully grilled, and the fries were crispy and perfect. I ordered the seafood salad, and was impressed by the presentation and flavor. It had perfectly cooked juicy scallops, shrimp, and shreds of Alaskan King Crab on it, and the amount of dressing on it was just right and not overpowering.   Between the glass of wine, his soda, my salad, and his sandwich, our bill was about $65...but it was a relaxing, leisurely lunch on our vacation, and the service was wonderful. I loved it and will definitely go back next time I am in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Apparently this place is pretty popular... I for one always thought it was the dressed of version of Joe's Crab Shack but according to everyone else it's a Miami dining staple!  This particular location is quite random, very bottom floor the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace. When you walk it it leads to the bar area, which seems kinda fun but is mostly there for those enjoying happy hour. Dining area is either in the outside area where you can gawk at shoppers or in the back dining room where it's so dark, you might just fall asleep.    The food selection is enormous. The wine list is so long, it's actually kinda intimidating, and the specialty drink list looks interesting (I opted for the Pomegranate Martini and ended up with nothing but a Welch's drink). Bread is not very good... they offer different variations which is a nice touch, but I don't know how you could possibly serve 7 different kinds of BAD bread?   We finally decided on the steak and tails dinner: $49.99 each. Lobsters were small but the taste was truly decadent. Steak was OK - but was a little on the dry side. I did see a waiter debone a fish for another customer and I was truly amazed! He literally got every piece of fish off that bone and in record time, it seemed! Overall, dinner was a 4 stars (counting just the food).   So, after we were done eating, it took a record of 20+ minutes for us to even flag anyone down to clear our table and bring us our check. We were trying just about anything to get the servers attention but to no avail. Finally, after a sturdy 'EXCUSE ME' - we finally got the waitresses attention.   Overall, food is good... but not necessarily the best service. Service should come standard with the prices, but definitely not at Joe's (maybe it's different at the one in Florida).",

    "text": "I do not care that I have been to a good number of fine dining restaurants. Every time I come to Vegas (which seems to be more and more frequent these days), I MUST - MUST - MUST!!!!! stop by Joe's Stone Crab at least once! This place does what it does extremely well - to perfection.   Waiters are attentive and personable, make you feel like a welcome family member. The atmosphere is casual, you will absolutely be using your hands to eat and licking your fingers as well. The portion sizes are generous and the prices are a steal for what you get.   My perfect meal here for 2 people who are splitting everything consists of the Hashbrowns, a whole order of the Select Stone Crabs and a half/half order of Select Stone Crabs with the Filet Mignon. I consider myself a meat eater but their half serving sizes are pretty generous. The Stone Crabs do have their \"seasons\" so if you come on off-season, get one of their other seafood items because you might be a little disappointed. However, if you do come during Stone Crab season, have a grand feast of it and use healthy amounts of their delicious mustard dipping sauce with the Stone Crab. And then of course you must have a dessert - any one of their pies will do and they're all huge so split away.",

The service: the staff were very professional and knew the menu backwards and forwards. They knew what to recommend, and they were right.  The food: Crab cakes for appetizer - ding ding ding! delicious, and not at all fishy. Then came the salad : delicious and fresh! I've tried several of their salads, and I have yet to be disappointed. The bisque is fail-proof as well.  Then, the pasta. It was cooked to perfection and was seasoned well.   I have yet to dry dessert from here. I always end up stuffing myself with the entrees, that by the time dessert menu rolls around... I am ready to roll around and go to bed. LOL",

    "text": "I didn't have a res, but I was just one person so I figured I'd be fine for a late Friday lunch. I had to wait about 10 minutes, but that was fine, surprised though at how packed the so-called patio area was (the couple in front of me was told it'd be an hour for the patio, or 5 minutes for the indoor dining room with the bar table seats).   This place was OK. I had a big breakfast at Bouchon so I couldn't order the prix fixe stone crab lunch as I had hoped (which is $27.95, not $21 as listed elsewhere). I didn't want to leave without having some kind of seafood and pie though, so on my server's rec, I got the seafood salad. It was a pretty huge undertaking; well worth the $16 - a giant lump of shrimp/crab/lobster on top of a huge chopped salad. I had asked my server what was in it and she only remembered lettuce as being one of the vegs. It turned to be two hardboiled eggs, lettuce, avocado, palm hearts, asparagus -- all nice surprises, though I imagine I'd have a fit if I had a food allergy and wasn't told about any of it. I couldn't finish it, but I did want to save room for pie. As I was struggling to breathe, my server suggested I might try a half slice of pie instead, which was a brilliant idea on their part, and dumb on mine: $3 for a sliver. But that was OK, since it was key lime and possibly the best key lime I'd had in my life. Nice, firm and tart, though the crust on the bottom was a tad hard.   I'll likely not eat there again since there's so many other options, but it was good. The patio was nice for people watching.",

I don't \"do\" Vegas usually because the customer service level in that town can be down right offensive if you are not a \"high roller\" or young person \"balling for the weekend\" so since I am in the business I tend to stay away from Vegas for those dayum reasons.  Interior - classy, perfect setting for a business luncheon if you need to make a good impression with your guests. Service was impeccable from the bussers to our server herself \"Suzanne\" had great recommendations from \"go\" was on IT from the drop of our beverages to the entrees hitting the table. I ordered the Fish & Chips flaky and light DELICIOUS! Key Lime Pie was just right and hit the spot. They do clear bottles off of tables rather quickly so make sure that when you have filled your pilsner  that you didn't leave anything in it as they are moving so quickly (this happened to me) they just might snatch yours with beer still in it LOL   They did have flat screen TV's that was on ESPN (grimacing as I am still on hiatus from any sports media tehehehehe) but from what I saw the TV's were only located in the main bar area. There seemed to be seatin in the rear (looked more private) and also a faux \"outside\" area to sit in like most of the restaurants located at the Forum Shops. Management was nice and was sure to Thank us our way out. WOW! i'm impressed... this restaurant is located in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace where you would expect the clientale to be expecting IMPECCABLE service, and that is what we received.

As locals, we go to Joe's 5-6 times a year for pleasure and business, usually the food and service is outstanding, last night, for Christmas dinner, it was horrendous on both fronts. We made reservations about a week in advance.  They called us that morning to confirm - then told us they could not find our reservation on the phone.  When we arrived, they told my wife they could not find the reservation, when my wife offered to show the confirmation number on her mobile phone the host says \"let me do my job.\"  After 3 minutes he then asks to see the confirmation number.  We finally get seated, and it gets worse.  We order dinner, drinks, and appetizers.  25 minutes after taking our order we are informed that the whole maine lobster is no longer available, we had ordered 2.  We then re-order. lobster tails and chiliean sea bass.  When the food arrives, our side dishes are missing.  One lobster tail was over-cooked, one under-cooked, and the seabass was bland.  The sides finally arrived more than mid-way through our entrees - the waitress apologizes, and says the sides will be taken off the bill.  We had also asked for refills on the bread - three times, which finally arrives when the plates are cleared.  The manager comes over, and acts annoyed that he has to apologize for the service and food.  Naturally when the bill comes, the sides are not taken off.   We were so bothered by the lack of concern, we paid the bill and left.  It will be awhile before we return to Joe's.",

    "text": "It's times like these when I truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. We had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but I really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to Vegas.  My first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! Located in the Forum Shopping mall at Caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic American bar and restaurant. We were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. We were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter ITodd) who took very good care of us. Both the host and Todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.  In less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. Todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  Everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. As an appetizer we ordered the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.... and OMG,...they were absolutely delicious! I can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best I have ever tasted! Next, how could we have come to Joe's without trying their 5-piece signature Stone Crabs Claws. Also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! Already cracked, Todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. And it actually worked!  For our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled Dover Sole, which was de-boned at table side. Simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. For myself, I ordered the Roasted Black Cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. It was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. The cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....I absolutely loved it.....I thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and I shared everything. For sides, we ordered the Sauteed Broccolini and highly recommended Roasted Swee Corn. Both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. The serving of corn was good, but I think there should have been a bit more Broccolini in the dish.  All this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants I have ever tried! The service was excellent and attentive, and I will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. I will definitely be back when I'm next in town. Oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.  I love this place! :)",

We then ordered our main courses. My girlfriend ordered the fisherman platter grilled and I ordered the petite filet with lobster tail and a side of sauteed brocollini. In the meanwhile I sipped on a Lagavulin 16 Islay Scotch. Very nice scotch.  Our mains came out and HOLY CRAP! Everything was cooked to perfection! My girls scallops were juicy, halibut was flaky and moist. My steak was savory an lobster was nice and sweet! I drool as I write this...  Definitely want to give a shout out to Neil!

I went with the King crab legs which come split and open, large and meaty. There were 5 people in my party and everyone was pleased with their food. Prices are on par with level of service and food quality. I highly recommend, this is some of the best seafood I have had in Vegas.",

The servers were very professional and friendly.. they wasted no time greeting us with a smile. We ordered a bottle of wine and within 2 minutes the wine was opened and everyone's glass was filled.     They brought out bread bowls with 4-5 different types of WARM bread and that nice soft butter we all love. The best part of the meal were the oysters we got... I am a BIG oyster person and these have to be some of the best I've had on the half shell.. so fresh!!  For dinner most of us ordered the combo lobster tail with a petite filet mmmm one of the best steaks I have ever had! The steak was so so juicy, tender and full of flavor (get medium rare, it's always best) The lobster tail was good not exactly the way I like it cooked but everyone else loved it. This combo plate seemed so small when it came out but once we started eating we realized nobody could finish it and we should have all split our plates.     We also got brussel sprouts which were some of the best I've had! In the end they brought out a yummy giant warm brownie for my birthday dessert. Overall the experience was amazing.. The bill came out to about $650 but we all got steak and lobster, oysters, tons of sides and two bottles of wine so not too bad when you look at it that way! can't wait to come back and be a pig again.",

Granted, I've only had supermarket crab before, so there hasn't been much other competition in my life, but...  I still dream about it. The crab claws. I prefer the Stone Crab over the others I tried, but seriously, it was all extremely fresh.   The restaurant slices them open for you, so all you need is that lil' fork to gut the gorgeous insides. And there was so much of it. So very much.   Bread basket at the beginning was also delicious.   And the pies. Glorious pies. My fav was the Havana Dream Pie.   Our server was lovely. And entertaining.   Score.",

We had a reservation and were taken right back to our table with no wait which was nice.  The booth they sat us at was intimate and comfortable.  We let our server know about a time constraint because of a show we were seeing and he was great about it!  Now on to the food!  The stone crab claws were out of this world!  Use the sauce they provide for the claws, it is so yummy.  The wedge salad and lobster bisque were spot on.  Lobster tail dinner was gigantic and perfect.  Hubbys crab legs were mild and meaty and they cut them for him at the table so no work was involved.  Even the sides were delicious.  We got corn and hash browns and they went perfectly with our meal.  There are no words to describe the perfection of the peanut butter pie. I can't wait to come back, keep up the good work Joe's!",

We arrived with hats in hand near 9pm and were seated at a beautiful table in the corner. Our waiter, Steve, is a very distinguished gentleman and an outstanding and attentive waiter. I started with the crab bisque. It is served at the table with a really cool presentation. To be perfectly honest, it was the best crab bisque I ever put into my mouth. No hyperbole intended. Hubby had the BLT Wedge salad and it is full of wonderful elements, including delicious pork belly (really) and chunks of perfectly aged blue cheese. An accidentally ordered Caesar Salad was fabulous--again another to add to my \"most delicious\" for the evening. The Seafood Platter was filled with two lobster tails, big juicy shrimp and tender, moist scallops--all cooked exactly as they should be. And the surprise side dish -- best ever macaroni and cheese.   Everyone who assisted Steve were friendly and treated us very kindly. We were so grateful for the memorable dinner--our 25th wedding anniversary celebration!",

The bartender was a truly awesome guy - he chatted with us all night while serving a packed bar and making drinks nonstop for the 2 hours we were there. A crazy multitasker and awesome conversationalist, he provided the best show in Vegas!  The food was excellent too. The bread basket they serve was wonderful (and we got 2 baskets!). The crab and artichoke gratin was creamy and savory. I got the salmon special, sauteed spinach, and the cottage fries for dinner. A perfect combination!

    "text": "What we expected to be a quick jaunt from Bellagio to the Forum Shops at Caesar's was anything but. Hubby and I had discussed well before we left for Las Vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping Joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the Forum Shops, there was Joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a Friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into Joe's. Amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! Ha!  We really didn't have to look at the menu. We knew that a plate of select stone crabs was in order. As many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then \"select\". We always get the select. We are never disappointed. The stone crabs, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. Oh how I love that sauce . . . so much so that when I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as my meal, I asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. Hubby had the Chilean sea bass. It was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. We also ordered the four cheese mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. As an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.  Atmosphere at Joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. They have the \"outside\" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. Just about everyone who walks into the Forum Shops from Las Vegas Boulevard walks past you. There is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. And then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old Italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in Las Vegas. I love the maitre d at the entrance to the back room. Even if he doesn't recognize you, he pretends he does!  That's a real art!",

Tip: They have large, horseshoe shaped booths in the corners - I like them because they're more intimate and you can still people watch. The scallops are literally the best I've ever tasted.  So delicious.  You have to try the stone crab of course.  We get ours steamed because I'm not as keen on the cold version (the standard way they are served).

Everyone said that the food was perfectly cooked and tender whether it was seafood or meat.   The portions were very generous.  The famous stone crab claws were naturally  sweet. Many of us ate them without the accompanying sauce.  Dessert... Yummy.  Everyone had a taste of the mascapone cheesecake and declared it the best of the various desserts that we ordered.

The stone crab, which I hadn't had before, was a disappointment...it was expensive, not cracked well and didn't have much flavor.  The steaks and baked potatoes were good though.  And we did have some decent wine, but I would have liked some more options in the the wines by the glass.  The only real flaw was that my peach and blueberry pie was full of berry stems.  So overall, it was a good dinner that we enjoyed, but at almost $300 with a tip, it should have been a bit better.",

The skin of the fish are fried on the right point but it is no affecting juicy fish meat  at all!   Pricy a bit but if you want a decent dinner, this will be the place you don't want to miss!",

    "text": "I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner, and we were so pleased with everything that we ordered. In terms of entrees, I had the chilean sea bass, and he had the large snow crab. While 5-6 snow crab legs didn't seem like a lot when we first checked it out on the menu, the legs are actually really meaty and filling! The sea bass was flavorful and tender, but the seasoning didn't overpower the buttery taste of the fish.   As for sides, we ordered the fried asparagus and shrimp and grits. Let me just say that I am a huuuuuuuuuge fan of creole food. You can imagine how excited I was when I saw that they had shrimp and grits on the menu. I was not disappointed! This place has the best Shrimp and Grits in Vegas and believe me I have tried everywhere. While everything is a la carte, the side dishes are big enough to be shared by 2/3 people (particularly if you order more than one).  Foodies typically approach restaurants with a \"one and done\" type attitude, but I definitely would eat here again!  The ambiance is very romantic. When I made the reservation, I walked in to find that they had a huge, round, dimly-lit booth reserved for us in the back. It made us feel so special because it was almost like we were in our own little world! Our server's name was Neil and he was so kind to us. Definitely an experience I won't forget!  Bottom line: All-around 5 stars.",

The ribeye was cooked a perfect medium rare and came with a flavorful house seasoning blend that we sprinkled on top of our steak.  The seasoning really made the steak stand out.   Our waiter recommended the roasted corn. I was skeptical about how good a side of corn could really be, but  our waiter was right! It was delish! The roasting really brought a wonderful smoky flavor to the corn. It was topped with clarified butter, cilantro, and a fresh squeeze of lime.    This was our first time eating stone crab, but hopefully it won't be our last! The stone crab was served cold which was a little bit uexpected but no less delicious. They cracked the claws before bringing them to table. The meat came out relatively easily, but we still had a few very hard slivers of shell that we unfortunately  ended up chomping down on.   The meat itself was succulant and slightly sweet. We would have been fine with eating the meat without any accompanyment but Joe's serves their crab with a very tasty mild mustard dipping sauce and fresh lemon.  The dipping sauce was flavored with with a hint of horseradish that paired fantastically with the sweet crab.  The meal was definately pricey but totally worth it. We can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Seriously? This place is NOT a 5-star restaurant, least of all for Vegas, home of the best restaurants in USA. My sister arrived 15 minutes early and asked to be seated so she could enjoy some wine. They said no way. Go to the bar but your daughter can't so she can wait in the other room. She refused to leave her unattended so they finally sat them on the patio as we arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time. We ordered for restaurant week, Copper River Salmon and Roasted beet salad.   Server seemed a bit perturbed but whatever, couldn't discern why. The beet salad was so salty. I tried eating it but couldn't. He offered the other appetizer options, which I didn't want. He told me he already put my fish order in so I better hurry and decide as he walked away. When he returned I repeated I didn't want the fried calamari or raw fish so he said they'd make a new salad. That was salty as well. He took the plate and said the manager will taste it and he would charge me for the house salmon. Fine. No response as to whether the manager's taste buds were similar to ours....   The Copper River Salmon did NOT taste or look wild but as it was over cooked and the beet drama, I ate it. Waiter continued to seem annoyed until he delivered three amazing pies, not ordered by us, to the table. He said here are some pies for you. Want knives? Sheesh. They were amazing but not good enough for the bad food and ungracious service. He wasn't doing us a favor and we were NOT rude at all regarding the salad mishap. Zagat, reconsider.",

I had the grilled seafood platter. 4 shrimp, 3 small lobster tails and 4 medium scallops. This was really good. Only issue was the scallops weren't cooked evenly. Two were perfect, one a little undercooked and the other overcooked. We tried the mashed potatoes and roasted corn. The corn was the best we ever had. The potatoes were covered in crispy breadcrumbs,  my husband liked it and I didn't. We ate too much bread so we didn't get to sample any desserts.",

We started out with oysters (fresh and delicious, and they have a unique icy mignonette that was neat) and the Select stone crab claws, which were awesome, especially with the mustard dipping sauce. Our server showed us how to extract the meat, and it was super easy because the claws are already cracked.   The bread basket contained a nice variety and the servers kept bringing out more whenever we ran low.  For our main, we opted for the bone-in dry aged ribeye (one is enough for 2!) from the specials and it was amazing! A perfect medium rare, charred on the outside which imparted a rich, smoky flavor. In comparison, our friends' regular ribeye ($22 cheaper) seemed anemic.   My favorite of the assortment of sides we tried was the brussels sprouts. The \"big daddy taters\" were good too, although I thought we were ordering the Lyonnaise potatoes (not sure if they're the same thing?). I'd say skip the unremarkable mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  Their Bloody Mary is really good. Comes accented by a cocktail shrimp and celery stalk, and the rim is encrusted with parmesan(?) cheese.  One of the more satisfying meals I've had in a while, and service was great (thanks Leanne!).",

The crab is obviously the highlight with those enormous claws... for me skip the filet o fish tarter sauce and stick to lemon..( keep it clean folks) ive had there chops before and to be honest, there are 6 and half better steak houses in vegas. btw, the half comes from the 5 am steak and eggs at the casino after botttle service. not even sure if its steak but it works.   For me i dont complain about the prices in vegas because afterall its vegas and thats how it is, so lets get mature about this and just enjoy the evening without the thrifty comments.

We decided to opt out of getting an appetizer because we never finish our entrees and my main plan was to get the stone crab appetizer and scallops as my entree but because we decided on no appetizer I got the medium stone crab as my entree. Every review talks about the stone crab so I figured we couldn't miss out on trying it. They were really good, the meat was sweet but I do recommend only getting them as an appetizer unless you want a cold entree. My boyfriend of course got the filet mignon and lobster and the filet was cooked perfect and as well as the lobster. And luckily he is a generous person and let me take a few bites of his plate since he could tell I wasn't so happy with mine.  The service was great - once we walked in and gave our names the host right away turned to Cam and wished him a Happy Birthday. We had reservations so we were seated quickly. Drinks were never empty and our table was cleaned before they brought out the birthday cake (that is a huge pet peeve of mine - don't bring out the cake until our table is cleaned off. Nothing like a bunch of dirty empty dishes on the table as we sing happy birthday! Maybe I'm weird but it does bother me.)",

    "text": "Ahhh Joe's! I am so glad I had a craving for seafood while I was in Vegas for St. Patty's Day my senior year of college. Otherwise, we might never have even met! The seafood here is incredible. My girls and I ordered a few drinks, appetizers and a few mains for us to share for a fancy lunch. Ummm Key Lime Pie Martini- where the hell have you been all my life?! Most delicious martini ever with a graham cracker crust around the rim of my glass!! Each sip felt like I was eating pie! I could tell right then and there that things were going to get better. For an appetizer I chose the tiger shrimp cocktail... pretty sure they were from the gulf but omg they were huge! Like 2 inches thick and 5 inches long huge! And so sweet! None of that shrimpy, fishy seawater taste at all. Honestly the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had in my life. For our main we split a few orders of the famous stone crab legs. Damn those things were huge!!! I was a little disturbed with the fact that these crabs are kept alive by only having one arm taken off at a time (as you know crabs can regenerate lost limbs) but once I put that giant piece of yummy, chilled crab flesh in my mouth..... all of that was forgotten. Well, until the end of the meal that is, haha. Guilt pangs came later. It was so delicious. Still... I can't believe that this isn't considered animal cruelty? I mean, I know it's a crab... but it's a living thing. Having your arm ripped off isn't a peach even if you can grow it back, I'm sure! Poor crabbies. Ahh why do they have to be so delicious? There I go again feeling guilt.... sniff.",

I believe my server name was Julie and she was awesome.  Although this is a high end restaurant I felt very comfortable in my shorts and polo.  We were seated on the patio which was an excellent seat for people watching in the Ceasar while dining.   I started with the 2nd mortgage appetizer that consisted of 1 Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Coctail, Alaskan King Crab, and Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.   All the meat was succulent and very flavorful.  Not a big fan of ceviche but I must say it was delightful.  For my main course I had the Lobster Tempura which left me speechless.  Fried Lobster who would have imagined.  For my finale I had the HAVANA DREAM PIE which my server forced me to try and was very happy she did.  Although I was stuffed they make it hard to pass on half portion desserts.    Overall my experience at Joe's was phenomonal and will most likely  visit again.",

The dining room is nice but plain.Nothing to confuse the purpose. our server JJ was the consummate professional. Service was excellent, spot on, True, knowledgeable and still friendly. Appetizer....Stone crabs. We ordered the medium size claws. I really do not see what the big hoopla is all about. Not nearl;y as tasty as dungeness, not as meaty as Alaskan King, and not as flavorful as soft shell blue. So ehh..so so at best on those.  The bread....EXCELLENT. Except come on Joe's take the pre baked dinner roll out of the basket it does not belong with the other bread selections. Crab cake......Very very good along with the Joes Mustard sauce. Well done ALOT of crab and cooked perfectly. Wifes Shrimp scampi was excellent. Flavorful, fresh and well garnished and served appealing. Lyonnaise potatoes....Both wife and i agreed they were as good as it gets. PERFECT. Asparagus...over done and too soft but still passable. Key lime pie....You can and should do better. It was so so at best and still partially frozen.....not what we expected nor should have expected from this caliber of restaurant.",

I had heard of Joe's and J's parents had been a few weeks before and loved it. So we knew it was probably pretty darned good.    The menu is pretty big and the prices can be off putting if you're expecting something from the old Vegas ($15 for fish and chips could freak some people out). C had a cheeseburger and asked for it to be medium but it came out a little closer to medium rare which I know he wasn't happy about. J and I had the Joe's Classic Lunch which is five stone crab claws, hash browns, cole slaw and key lime pie. The stone crabs were sweet and didn't really need the dipping sauce that came with it. The hash browns were super crispy outside and flavourfully tender inside. The cole slaw was less successful despite the tableside dressing it got from our waiter - it was better than KFC but still a bit underwhelming. I wasn't a fan of key lime pie before but that little sliver with it's massive dollop of not overly sweetened whipped cream was really wonderfully tart with a great buttery crumbly crust.     Our service was slow to start with but picked up half way through. I will come back next time I'm in Vegas.",

For a place that claims to be known for their seafood and steak, both were mediocre at best. The shrimp and scallop ceviche was chewy, hard, and almost bitter. The $40 filet mignon which I ordered as medium rare came WAY over cooked, and when I asked for a replacement (at $40 for a piece of meat, it better come the way I ordered it), not only did the second steak come undercooked, it was completely cold inside...they took a steak from the fridge, threw it on a grill that was way too hot, and served it rare and cold. Who is in charge of this kitchen? Our waiter was not only unapologetic about it, but acted put out by their mistake and hurried us out. The stone crab was not worth the money either. We highly recommend AVOIDING this restaurant.",

There were 12 of us, so unfortunately we had to split up into two table right next to each other, but it didn't matter... the highlight of the night was the food.  We started with the seafood sampler appetizer, which wasn't the greatest deal because we only got one of each item (jumbo shrimp, medium stone crab, and lobster), and it was ok.  The shrimp and lobster were good but the stone crab was difficult to eat and not very flavorful.  Next, I opted for the surf and turf special that night.  It was the signature bone-in filet plus 12 ounces of lobster (yes, 12-ounces!).  The filet was cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful, and there was so much lobster it was unreal.  I shared asparagus, broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, and cheesy potatoes with the table, but the sides were neither blockbuster not abysmal... just good.  Dessert was key lime pie, and it was great.    Overall, a wonderful meal.  A little pricey, but we knew that going in so I'm not deducting any points for the price.  Come with an appetite (and a full wallet).",

    "text": "I ate at Joe's for the first time last night.  I made a reservation using Open Table and ended up in the very back of the restaurant which apparently most people don't know even exists.  Joe's is a very large place!  I started with an iced mocha coffee with nonfat milk.  Very happy because a lot of restaurants only offer hot coffee and since I do not drink alcohol iced coffees are my drink of choice.  I then had a blt wedge salad which I loved!  I was unsure I would like it because I like classic wedge salads but all the toppings and small cut bacon and eggs were very good.  I then had the $74 king crab legs.  I loved how the legs were cut for me to easily pull out the chunks of meat.  It was a HUGE amount of crab and sadly I could not finish.  The waitress offered to wrap the rest of the meat up for me but I was not going home for a long time so this wasn't possible.  I would recommend if you go to Joe's you share this as an entree meal.  The sides were good and apparently you can get half-orders of sides.  I tried to creamed spinach which was about what I expected, as well as tried the broiled tomatoes.  You wouldn't know from the menu that broiled tomatoes are actually broiled tomatoes with spinach puree on top and then covered in Wisconsin cheddar.  I did like the tomatoes and would not have ordered them expect another person in my party wanted them.  My boyfriend had the liver which was wrapped in bacon.  He had never had liver before but we figured if he ever wanted to try it then here was a good place to try it.  He did like it!  I refused to try it.  I'm sorry I'm narrow-minded!  Since I am a local and my boyfriend is a local the waitress brought us each a slice of pie that we shared with the table.  I guess if you are a local and it is your first time you get a free piece of pie!  Yay!  My girlfriend, who was also stuffed with king crab, devoured the banana cream pie that had real banana slices at the bottom and caramelized nuts on top.  I had the chocolate pie and I loved it!  All around good experience and excellent service.  The manager stopped by and he was VERY nice!",

Most of the steaks were OK but I expected higher quality for the prices.  The waiter only seemed interested in selling us the high end crab specials which we did buy,, very good but nothing special and waaaay overpriced ($65 for an appetizer??).  One of the steaks came out extremely rare and was sent back to make it medium rare.  It came back to the table looking like a piece of charcoal....disgusting!  Not what would be expected in this type steak house.  The waiter was basically nonexistent for drinks etc, which one in our party actually went to the bar and had to get himself.  There are so many better restaurants out there!  I don't mind spending the money, I just expect good service and tender meat if I'm going to pay $60 for a steak.  Our bill was just under $1000.  I'd think the waiter would pay attention to a table like that considering he's looking at a $200 tip?  Makes no sense.  I would never go back here!  Go to Switch in the Encore hotel.  Same prices, excellent service, and delicious food!",

He seemed to forgot a lot of stuff specifically in our table. First ,it took him a long time to ask me what drink i want . He did not offer us any bread ( Tables next to us are getting theirs and we ordered 4 adults menu. )Then, he forgot to give my 5 year old niece her apple juice and her ice cream that she is been looking forward to that is supposed to be included in her kids meal. The poor kid is very thirsty ! My sister asked him twice before he finally gave it to her. He forgot to give us towels   after our meal .... one reason I love coming to joe's is because of this nice little extra that they give you warm towels after you order alaskan crab or stone crabs. It makes your hand feel clean and not stinky. Again, he gave towels to the tables next to us that he is serving. I ordered $ 150.00 of to go meals and he was happy to automatically charge me 18 % gratuity  on that as well. The nerve when his service sucked ! He is lucky i was still nice enough to give him a 20 % tip for our $ 100 lunch .  We usually get excellent service -  when I am with my husband that is Caucasian. My sister actually pointed this out. Not trying to pull the Racial stuff but it sure does seems like it. Did he think we are ignorant Asians ? For Las Vegas that is a thriving tourist economy , those that in the tourist industry should be more mindful in catering to individuals and should not look  at the color of their skins. Tourists or not, We are the reason why you have jobs !  You get better service at IHOP !   Joe's should also consider putting a more friendlier matre d for lunch . He is not very helpful .  The girl that answers the phone is also very rude to me because I have an accent. This happened yesterday, April 9,2012.   Other that that food is excellent !",

    "text": "With a name like theirs all I was expecting was something along the lines of an \"average Joe's\", although my nephew and his family thought quite highly of it.  Located at the end of the newer wing of the Forum Shops it still had the feel of being within a mall, so dining alfresco really meant that you have a great view of the escalators.  Well, to our surprise, it was a tuxedo waitered affair with full linen service...  With our expectations in check, we were initially led to a table between the doors leading to the patio by a slightly stoic maitre 'd that we failed to impress.  That said we told him that we preferred a larger, more centered 4-top that was available, and so we were seated without a problem.  In retrospect, he may have thought that the tiny two-top was a more intimate seating, but no way, not between the doorway and it certainly would have been a problem with all the food we would wind up ordering...  I'm down for seafood, prime steak, and Stone Crab just like the man says;  but they weren't highlighting their signature Stone Crabs with their distinctive black tipped claws saying that they're not quite in season and frozen at the time of our visit.  Bummer.  For appetizer, we would wind up ordering a Colossal Lump Crab Cake to share and for once we were glad that we did <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#049L-tNAbUwi0aI7OMuT8g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>.  One of the better crab cakes that we've had, it was meaty and succulent interior belittling it's perfectly crisp scone-like battered exterior (more on this later) prompting my wife to declare that this was the best crab cake she tasted, as good as Old Ebbitt's in DC.  The Caesar Salad (of course) was tossed and divided for us without even having to ask, the freshly grated Parmesan was good quality and had that slightly salty flavor... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#HcnqzqvXr5vmnf6z4C4Umw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>  Here at Joe's they have a set of signature Bone-In cuts and I was tempted for a moment to order the Filet Mignon with the bone because I've never really heard of such a thing, but for my first try I wanted to have a basis for comparison to others the tried and True bone-in ribeye cut.  The 20oz Bone-In Rib Eye is flown in just like everything else in LV from somewhere in the midwest, it was prepared perfectly with a good even outer sear <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#MYSVBsRccwc5b83vREBdkA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>.  Delicious and savory with much of it flavor from the extra marbling, it rivaled steaks at other places that sometimes cost more.  Wifey had a little land and sea action of her own in the Seared Sea Scallops on a bed of Crispy Braised Pork Belly served with cabbage and kale <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#oiTUiM-A23ti5BJV_6xTKg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>.  Like most traditional steakhouse experiences, the sides are separate and usually uber simple in presentation and these were no exception.  The Baked Potato was a huge russet with all of the dressings on the side as I requested <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#2d345ddy1_34dMQL7_F3rA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>.  The Grilled Asparagus was interesting if for the sweet and tangy flavors of the accompanying Romesco... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#uId88jY4q9-OrFODrK1Hyg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>  Although we didn't notice it much at the time since we were enjoying the salad, our crab cake appetizer was actually served after the salad because the kitchen burnt the first one and insisted on making another one before it came out resulting in an out of order but otherwise unnoticed delay.  Because of their faux pas, they decided to comp us two slices from their famous pie only dessert menu:  the Banana Cream Pie <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#z4g_Kdhogn6XqcjtyLEGXA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a> and their signature Key Lime Pie <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2#ZEw71UqTC2Y7ELYfUQYdQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a>.  I favored the former for its sweetness over the later's tartness, but both were fabulously fresh tasting...  The service was exemplary,  our waiter was chatty but delightful to converse with.  The food preparation was excellent and I appreciated that they felt that something was not good enough to be served without waiting for the customer to complain before doing something about it.   I would love to come back to try the stone crab albeit we seem to in LV at the same time every year...",

Everyone we came in contact with were very nice. I wanted to try the stone crab and my waitress recommended that I order 1 to try it first just in case I didn't like it. It was ok but I'm not a fan of cold seafood, thankfully I didn't order a full serving. The lamb chops I ordered were delicious and I loved the crab cakes. I even saw Dennis Rodman come in, he took a few pics with fans but I was too scared to ask for one.",

There's only 3 locations i believe in Chicago, Miami, and Vegas. We were all saying how they should open one up in LA. They have to... it would make a killing. But for the time being, since vegas is the closest, looks like we'll have to make a trip back soon.",

    "text": "This one is a keeper.  Let's start with our server - Linda.  She was friendly, helpful, and frankly delightful.  She has this lovely London accent, and it was very pleasant chatting with her - at length and on topics ranging far beyond the menu.  But she was also serious about wanting us to enjoy every aspect of our meal.  This was not the typical waiter mumbling \"is everything okay?\" as he speeds past your table.  Linda was seriously concerned that everything was perfect, and anxious to fix anything that wasn't.  She even told us about a shortcut that shaved 15 minutes off of our trek back to the Caesar's Palace parking lot, without having to walk all the way through the Forum Shops.  (By the way, we also learned that the better way to come by car is to park with Joe's own valet at the entrance off the Strip.)  As this was our first visit to Joe's, our first impression of the food was going to be the bread basket.  Check.  A very nice assortment of fresh bread, rolls, and flatbread.  I was not prepared to do the laborious claw-cracking that would have come with ordering the house specialty Stone Crabs, but I did want to try the crab so I started with the crab cake appetizer.  I don't really expect to find Maryland-quality crab cakes anywhere in Vegas, and I still don't, but this crab cake was quite good.  Plump lumps of crab without too much filler.  Still focused on the crab, my next course was a small cup of the crab bisque.  It was excellent.  Just the right amount of crab flavor.  (Actually, the small cup was not on the menu, but Linda to the rescue - she arranged for a cup rather than a bowl of the soup, so I could save appetite for the main course.)  Which was... Chilean Sea Bass.  A very nice piece of fish, perfectly cooked.  My only quibble is that the Miso glaze, although flavorful, left the top of the fish tasting a bit over-salty.  If I was awarding Michelin stars, this small imperfection might have been an issue.  But these are Yelp! stars, and I'm still giving 5 of them.  My wife had the seafood salad.  My wife is a bit picky about her ingredients, but there was Linda again - going over each component of the salad, and getting the kitchen to hold all the ingredients that were not to my wife's taste.  She loved the salad.  We also shared a side of hash brown potatoes, which was plenty big for two people - we couldn't finish it.  The hash browns were unusual - a mound of potatoes that was very crispy on top, but light and fluffy inside.  My wife and I both enjoyed them very much.  Joe's is very popular, but also very large.  Don't be fooled by the small bar area and patio, which is what you see as you walk in.  After 5 p.m. the main dining rooms open, with lots of tables.  Somehow Joe's does a good job of packing a lot of tables into their space, without making it feel crowded and still keeping down the noise level.  I found the decor to be very comfortable, without much decoration.  A mural-sized photo of the original Joe's in Miami, and a few photographs on one wall, were the extent of the adornments in our dining room, and that was fine for me.  Finally, price...  I thought our meal was a very good value.  Even with cocktails and wine, we were out the door for well under $200.  That's pretty good for a restaurant that Yelp! rates with three $$$.  There are a lot of good values on the menu, and you could easily eat at Joe's on a reasonable budget.  Give it a try.",

    "text": "To me, few meals are better than fresh, properly cooked seafood. I came to Joe's with a large party on a Saturday night. The reservation was at 9:30pm. I checked in with the maitre d' at 9:40 and I was the first one there. The staff was so gracious about saving our table until the rest of the guests trickled in. We finally had a quorum and were seated at 10:15. Please note that Joe's usually requires your entire party to be present to seat you.   I started with an order of stone crab claws. I've been to Joe's in Miami so I was looking forward to that particular dish. The waiter brought me 4 instead of the usual order of 6.  Not sure if that's because they were running out of claws or he really thought 6 would be too many. In either case, it worked out and was less expensive. The order of 6 was $47 I think. I also had the large seafood salad as my entree. It was fresh, but unremarkable. I probably wouldn't order that again. I wish I'd had space in my belly for a slice of key lime pie! Had it in Miami and it was epic :-).   Other highlights at the table were the crab cakes and crab legs. The portions are very generous. I heard that the steak and some of the sides were salty, but I didn't have them myself. Again, the service was top notch and the staff was very gracious. I look forward to eating at Joe's again.",

If you're like me and didn't know, stone crabs are a miracle of nature and regenerate their claws like a lizard regrows it's tail.  As such, the harvesting season is quite short and the claws can be rather expensive.  The claws come in three sizes and the meat is delicious and sweet.  The key lime pie is tart, creamy and wonderful!  It is hands down, one of the best pies in the world!  The chocolate, peanut butter desert is also quite but the pecan pie is too sweet for me.",

We had a large group and they could only accommodate us at 2 adjacent round tables.   We ordered:  Octopus appetizer - this was very good, the octopus was very tender and non-chewy. However, there wasn't a lot of octopus on the plate, there was a lot of beans and greens which was a little disappointing.  Filet with lobster - I ordered the steak medium rare but it came out well done and it was really burnt on the outside. I had to send it back and they were super nice about it. They remove the shell of the lobster table side and the filet was super juicy and cooked perfectly. This was prob one of the best mains here in addition to the seafood platter.  Select stone crab - even though the stone crab wasn't in season, it still tasted very fresh. Delicious!  Key lime pie - This was just ok. The group liked the other 2 desserts way better.   Peanut butter pie - The best dessert! It's a huge slice and we were eating it with the banana cream pie lol  Banana cream pie - BOMB!",

    "text": "So close to being perfect, but not quite there.  I'm divided writing this review - Everything I had for my lunch, was perfect. Jumbo shrimp cocktail was excellent. The shrimps were just right, fresh and delicious and the sauce was perfect. The king crab was divine - Even though it's not a cheap course, and I was hesitant to have it as I was afraid I might still be hungry afterward - It was precisely the amount I needed and tasted like heaven. The desserts, and especially the key lime pie - So good I almost cried right there and then.  BUT. That wasn't the experience my wife had. She doesn't eat seafood and asked for a NY strip steak, medium rare. And unfortunately, It wasn't good. While it was still red(ish) on the inside, it was very burned on the outside (see photos). That's not a good way to serve steak, especially when the request was for a medium rare one. My wife had a few bites, didn't like it, and it was her first time ever asking to cancel an order. It made her feel guilty as it's not a cheap course and she settled to have a dessert and nothing else, as, by that time, I was already close to finishing my course.  So while I had a wonderful time, it was not the same experience for my wife, unfortunately. I do have to say that our waiter (and the service in general) was wonderful and that he was visibly disappointed when he saw that my wife is not enjoying her time. The complimentary desserts were a nice gesture and all in all I will be happy to come back here.",

Their steaks are on point and can easily hang with the likes of Cut or Mastros.  Obviously their seafood is no slouch and excellent as well.  I really enjoy their crab cakes. All crab no filler. If you have a larger group then I'd order the stone crab as an appetizer.  Their dessert game I'd say is their weak link.  Unless you're a big fan of homemade pies.  Never the less they're still really good.  On a side note, Joes can be hard to find.  It's at the very bottom of The Forum Shops near the rear valet.",

    "text": "My birthday dinner couldn't have been more wonderful thanks to Joe's!  I've had this place bookmarked for a very long time.  They are located in the Forum Shops at Caesars.  It's certainly worth the time and money for locals to park in the hotel parking and meander through the shops to find the restaurant.    Our table started with the Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms.  OMG. I could've only had this appetizer and still would've been extremely happy.  The delectable mushrooms are stuffed with a creamed spinach baked with cheese on top of each.  It was a perfect starter.    Of course I had to order the Stone Crab for my entree.  I chose the Select Stone Crab which had a variety of sizes stacked on the plate.  It was my first time having stone crab.  I think there is a little bit of a sweeter taste which is definitely right up my alley.  The claws sure do have plenty of crabmeat to fulfill my indulgence.    We also shared Jennie's Mashed Potatoes for the side dish.  It's surely plenty to share as I'm sure the waiters will make you aware. They are cheesy with a baked bread crumb topping.    Since the waiter knew we were celebrating, he brought us a dessert on the house.  The birthday sundae is actually a gluten free brownie.  I couldn't believe how rich and decadent this truly was.  I guess I can be gluten free if need be!  I really appreciate the wonderful service we received with one of the best meals I've enjoyed.",

After dining here for the first time ever, I have to say that this place definitely lives up to its reputation with the excellent service and high quality food.   I came here last Thursday night for a work related dinner event that was hosted in one of the private rooms in the restaurant. The staff were very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. The spread of food that we were served was impressive! For the appetizers, we had stuffed mushrooms, shrimp, calamari, two different kinds of salad, and of course, the famous stone crabs with their mustard dipping sauce. For the main course, I chose the 8 oz filet mignon and it was amazing! It was so tender and flavorful. They also brought out a few sides to complement the main course including mashed potatoes and asparagus. For dessert, I chose the chocolate fudge pie. Everything was made to perfection and extremely delicious!  Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Seafood is a great place if you're looking for a romantic date night or wanting to celebrate a special occasion with good company. The nice thing is that there's valet service for $7 just located right outside of the restaurant in the Forum Shops. I definitely recommend checking this place out. You won't regret it.",

Things started off a little rocky as we showed up late for our reservation with me angry (because we were late for our reservation which I loathe!) but they were lovely about it and we were shown promptly to a nice booth.    The food was terrific - but more importantly our server was polished, professional, attentive and warm and really made the night for us (ask for John Smart!!).  When I inadvertently ordered clam chowder which turned out to be Manhattan instead of Boston, he kindly brought me the crab bisque instead and my husband polished off the clam chowder gratis.  I had an amazing crabcake for dinner that was, like, ALL CRAB, no filler, and some delicious mashed potatoes.  My husband had crab claws (huge) and then a grilled seafood platter that he was a huge fan of.  The other couple we were dining with were also super happy with their choices (steak was beautifully done).  Our appetizers were excellent as well - Madagascar shrimp and the most tender calamari I've ever had.  There are so many great restaurants in Vegas, but I can honestly say this one will be a repeat for me on our next visit.",

We showed up a bit early for our reservation and were seated right away.   We ordered the medium stone crab ($50), 2 - 24oz bone in rib eyes ($60), and calamari and chopped salad to share with our group of 4. The crab was enough for one person to have two claws, which was perfect for a taste. And their mustard dipping sauce was sooo good!!! I don't normally like crab but this was a must get!!! The crab came cracked so it wasn't too much work.   Between the crab and the steak, the waitress came by and squeezed some lemon into our hands for us to freshen up, then finished with a warm wet towels. Wow!  My steak was medium rare just how I liked it. The 24 oz was definitely enough for two people to share. One of the best steaks I've ever had. The meat was juicy and tender.   Overall I thought it was decently priced for the quality and portions of food. Total came out to about $65 a person after tax and tip, and we were stuffed!",

We had reservations and good thing we did because it was a packed! It was a night ambiance dress code really wasn't an issue seen casual, dress casual, all the way to decked out classy. They start you with a variety assortment of bread, which were all delicious. For appetizers we ordered fried oysters, they were delicious. For our drinks I had a grapefruit margarita (extremely strong & my way to go!) and my bf had a Moscow Mule. Our entree was the Grilled Seafood Platter, Fish & Chip (a bit overpriced) and Joes Grilled Tomatoes. The platter was perfect for two, but I wished they had a nice dipping butter to compliment it. The Fish & Chip was your basic seafood market dish that maybe they should spice it up so you get more bang for ya buck! The grilled tomatoes were delicious! Overall I had a lovely dinner and they brought out a wonderful dessert for my birthday .",

    "text": "We chose this restaurant for my Mom's 75th birthday celebration dinner during a family trip to Las Vegas. We were staying at the Mirage and attending a show at the Flamingo right after with Joes situated more or less between them, so location factored into our decision.  Then there were all those 5 stars Yelp reviews that I'm thrilled to add to.  Truthfully, Joes would have been worth going out of the way for!  To start, I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that our party was  seated in a small private room for our celebration. I'd made reservations for 8, but we lost 2 people and ended up being only 6.  The room was more space than we needed, but if the staff at Joes was annoyed by this, they never let on.  The private room allowed for exceptional service as our waiter seemed to enter at just the right moment every time to check on us, and I imagine that he was probably keeping an ear tuned from outside.  The food was just amazing.  We were going after simple, well-executed steak and seafood which Joes delivered flawlessly.  Most of us opted for the surf and turf or the grilled seafood platter and we all raved. We shared a number of side dishes such as hash browns, creamed spinach and brussels sprouts that were also exceptional and delicious on their own merit, becoming memorable parts of the meal.   We were all too full for much dessert, but Joes brought my Mom a complimentary dessert of chocolate fudge pie with vanilla ice cream with a candle on top.  So thoughtful in every way!  I wouldn't hesitate to return or to recommend, especially if you're celebrating a special event. 10 stars!",

However I have done other upscale restaurants on the strip and for the price, Joes provides high quality food. From sea food to steak, they can do it all!! My favorite is the sea food platter, the fish and chips and the Alaskan roll. The ambiance is pleasant and the service is great. Make room for pie!!! The banana cream pie is incredible, nice and sweet!! So is the Havana pie (tres leches inspired pie with strawberries). The white sangria is a must, however they don't offer pitchers which I think they are missing out on.",

I always try to keep in mind that it may have been a busy night, but it doesn't excuse the total lack of service we received. Our waiter barely came by our table. Maybe because we're younger and they assumed we would not tip. Who knows.  The starter salad was mediocre but the bread was delicious. The steak was fantastic along with the brussell sprouts and mac and cheese. We tried the stone crab and I personally did not like it. It tasted too fishy to me and the cold turned me off. The dipping sauce on the side was good so thankfully we had that.   All in all, it was decent. For the amount of money I don't think it was worth it. I can't say that I will be back, but I wouldn't turn people away from it. I just think there are plenty of other places in Vegas that are better to spend your money at.",

We ordered the rib eye medium well, the filet medium & lobster tail, deep fried asparagus and the 4 cheese Mac & cheese. The filet was tougher than I anticipated and not seasoned well so I needed the bernaise sauce they offered. The lobster tail was a smidge over cooked giving it a slight rubbery texture.  My hubby's steak came out medium rare which obviously is a huge difference from what he ordered. He did send it back and they brought it back medium. Still not what he ordered but I told him if it cooked any longer he's just ruining a good steak. His steak was definitely better than mine, if we go back I'll definitely order a rib eye. The deep fried asparagus was yummy!  There was a creamy lemon sauce with it for dipping but that wasn't needed. Hubby loved the Mac & cheese, it was good but not something I would order again. All in all a decent visit, good food and nice ambiance. I'd visit again but order the rib eye and some other sides.",

The service was wonderful and the place kind of has a old mob style restaurant vibe (is that a thing?), which I dig.   We got the jumbo shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. By far the biggest shrimps I have ever seen!   The filet was cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  Juicy and tender, melt-in-your-mouth and full of flavors. The tail was large and in charge and the perfect pairing to the filet.  My mouth is starting to water writing this review. I'm done.",

WOWOWOW so amazing.  I never had stone crab before.. but dang it was awesome with some lemon and Joe's mustard sauce.  Next up was Kumamoto oysters.  I usually order kumamotos at my local oyster farm but these were bigger and had a stronger cucumber taste.. Delicious hands down.  Lastly, the filet and tail.. the filet mignon was so tender and they cooked it just perfectly.  I like my steak rare and they did a perfect job.  The lobster tail was also exceptional. Everyone ordered the same dish and it couldn't have been a better dinner.  Overall, this place was a home run for us.  I wouldn't hesitate to go again the next time im in vegas.

I was told that the do not have \"VO\". REALLY??? The waiter should have offered other whiskey brands, but did not.  We started to order our dinners. My wife ordered, then I ordered stone crab claws, a Ceasar salad, and Chilean sea bass. I order this every time that I go to Joe's, as it is one of the best entree's that I have had anywhere. I was then told by the waiter that they did not have the Chilean sea bass tonight. Once again, the waiter did not offer any suggestions for something else. Rather than ruin an already disappointing birthday dinner, we decided to leave. At no time did a manager or Maitre D come to talk to us. We ended up at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant and had a great dinner.",

It's too tightly packed in and I felt myself cringing as people walked past our table.   Our server was good, but tried to be a little too jokey/sarcastic for my taste. However, I wish I'd listened to his recommendations, because my friend did, and his meal was MUCH better than mine.  Not that mine was bad, but it was just nothing special. I got the shrimp cocktail and the crab cakes, and the cheesy mashed potatoes as a side. My impression was kind of \"meh. I really wasnt a fan of the potatoes- you can't really taste the cheese, and the breadcrumb topping was unnecessary and didn't add to the dish.  My friend got the grilled octopus, sea bass, and the steamed spinach, which were all amazing! I was filled with food regret and envy. Even my dessert choice, the Havana dream cake didn't wow me.

We made reservations for 5:30 since the location was going to close early for an event. When we arrived, we were welcomed and seated in the main dining room. The attention to service and detail was amazing! Neil was our server and he gave us great suggestions and answered our questions about the menu. We ordered 1/2 dozen oysters to start off with. Followed by a nice bottle of red wine to enjoy with our meal. I ordered the lamb and my boyfriend ordered the bone in ribeye. We selected the broccolini and the mash as our sides. I was not only impressed with the deliciousness of the meal but also the service provided by Neil. He was amazing! I would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely return here when I come to Vegas.",

Of course we had stone crabs and 24oz rib eye. Stone crab was amazing. Taste very fresh and juicy. I personally allergic to crab, but I still love it so much! The rib eye was very juicy and perfect cook at right level -medium rare.",

The waiter suggested that I order the king crab AND stone crab when I couldn't decide. That was a fantastic recommendation. Each had its own unique flavor. I have a new love for stone crab. The ambience is perfect for a special date night or just out on the town with friends. The service is exceptional with not a single need left unmet. The waiter we had for the night took me back to when waiters loved their jobs. Making small talk and telling us about his favorite things in Las Vegas. I could not have asked for anything more. The night ended with banana cream pie which may have been the best I have ever tasted. The flaky crust and perfectly made whip cream was to die for. This place has become a permanent stop for all Las Vegas trips going forward.",

They do want all of your party to be present  before they seat you. The crab bisque was amazing!!! The presentation was awesome. I had the large crab claws. They are melt in your mouth especially with the dipping sauce. I loved that it is pre cracked. My husband had the bone in ribeye. That was melt in your mouth. The sides we ordered was corn and asparagus which was ok. This is going to be a place that I do want to come back to. It's worth every penny!! Service was good. We noticed that the other tables did get bread, but we didn't. We were okay with it, because it would of been a filler.",

    "text": "(My 1000th Review, whoa.)  As a solo diner with limited stomach real estate, I was really glad to hear that I could order Joe's stone crabs by the claw instead of finding myself required to commit to an order of 5-7 based on size for $39.95+.  While I awaited my meal, they brought out a rather lavish bread basket of five different options at which I picked at selectively in order to not overstuff the belly.  That evening I dined lightly on a single large claw $13.99 and a side of sauteed broccolini $9.95.  The crab shell was quite thick, but fortunately they serve it cracked up for the picking.  For something labeled \"large,\" it wasn't actually all that large, so I was glad that I had opted for this size claw over both the medium and the select, which resulted in more meat for the same work exerted.  The broccolini was the first green thing I ate in Vegas and I found it crisp tender, garlicky and quite good.  I was seated in the dining area by the bar where they have a set up of tall round tables paired up with tall chairs.  At the end of my meal, a lemon water dampened cloth was brought over for me to wipe my hands.  For additional cleaning, the bathroom was up a flight of stairs.  Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is located at The Forum Shop at Caesars Palace, if I remember correctly, up on the 2nd floor by the entrance from the Strip.",

We had made reservations a few months in advance, and brought a total of 6 adults here following our wedding on the High Roller. We came here because my brother had been talking about stone crab for the past couple of years, so my husband thought this would be a good place to go. Our server Bill completely set the tone for our fantastic meal. He guided us in our choices and we gave him the freedom to bring out sides for our table, and I had him pick a bottle of wine. The pace of the meal was perfection, and we celebrated our marriage with those close to us. Our server was a class act, exactly what you want in a professional. Thank you to our wonderful server Bill and thank you to the entire staff of this stellar restaurant! The next time we are in Vegas we are for sure going back! Thank you thank you!!!!",

Located in the Forum Shops on the main floor, close walk from where we stay at the Bellagio. Our server was very attentive and so was the rest of the people working at Joe's. We ordered the stone crab bisque (split order between two which was recommended from the server and he was right they said it was super tasty and filling) and lettuce tomato and onion salad to start. For dinner we had the Chopped salad (which was great!) classic cheeseburger, crab cakes and the grilled seafood tower. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and left very satisfied! They also brought a brownies and ice-cream dessert out for my sister's birthday which was very much appreciated! Can't wait to dine here again!",

Located in the forum shops at Caesars (which is absolutely gorgeous) the amount of art in this place is surreal and breathe taking. We went 8pm on a Sunday and it was busy. I ordered the 12oz filet and she got the grilled seafood platter (grilled shrimp, lobster tails, and scallops) the menu is a la carte so we had to order sides . We went with Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. Both were out of this world. The filet was a beautiful medium rare and it came with a side of seasoning. Just salt pepper and garlic but it made the filet that much more mouth watering. I'm a fan of A1 and they give you a small personal bottle of A1 which I think is pretty awesome!! Overall food was great service was great prices were fair and I'll definitely recommend to everyone!!",

    "text": "Our last night in Vegas, we were walking thru The Forum at Caesars and Yelp reviews led us here. We arrived a bit after 6 p and the seats in the mall areas had a small wait so we opted for a high table in the bar to watch a soccer game that was being shown.  A waiter/busboy came over fairly quickly to offer water and our waitress Cera followed shortly with a basket of assorted breads and butter. I dived right in for the warm cornbread muffin and pretzel roll...yummy! There was also a flatbread crisp, a roll and two slices of raisin bread.  We decided on the skirt steak with shirataki peppers, the mahi tacos and two sides (Cole slaw and a baked sweet potato).  Our entrees & sides arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly, great seasoning and very tender. The peppers were very good but my hubby doesn't really like peppers so I had a few but there was too much food to finish them all. My grilled mahi tacos were spot on. Mini taco shells offered just the right amount of carbs balanced with jacama slaw. The Cole slaw was served over sliced tomatoes and had the perfect amount of dressing and seasoning. The baked sweet potatoe was huge, sweet and very tender. Didn't really need the cinnamon butter.  Cera was attentive and stopped by several times to check on us. Our water glasses were never empty, our table was quickly cleared as we finalized. Tab including tip around $87. 5 star experience! Wish we had room for dessert - ample selection of pies!",

    "text": "Excellent meal, wonderful service, and great atmosphere makes it easy to give his restaurant 5 stars.  This restaurant has all of the ingredients (pun intended) for one of the best meals we've had in Vegas in awhile.  Don't let the front entrance mislead you --- this restaurant is huge!   Yet, i never felt  forgotten or rushed thru our meal.    Our server Todd provided outstanding service.  His recommendations were spot on, and he provided guidance to our party of 8 on how to order and share our side dishes, without wasting food.  We had the seasonal roasted corn, loaded lyonnaise potatoes, and broccolini.  All three were flavorful and seasoned jut right.   My meal started with a perfect martini served in a classic martini glass.  My least favorite item was the Ceasars salad; it was just okay. My husband's lobster bisque balanced out the poor salad; the soup was piping hot with superb blend of cream and lobster chunks.   I shared a bone in ribeye with my friend, and I'm glad I did.  The portion was very large, and cooked perfectly to our request.  The steak was served on two separate plates, ready for us to dig in without having to cut it and divide up ourselves.  My mouth is watering thinking about it now.   Todd recommended the key lime and Havana pies.  My husband and I shared the Havana pie.  Oh my goodness!  Perfect ending to our perfect meal.  Highly recommend.    Last but not least, we were pleasantly surprised to learn the restaurant offered a VERY generous military discount.  This discount was greatly appreciated and will make this a repeat restaurant when we return to Vegas.   Since our party of 8 is retired Air Force guys, we all were tickled pink when we got the discount.  We then went back to casino after dinner to see if our luck continued, and it did.    Visit Joe's...you'all be glad you did.",

    "text": "I have dined at Joe's on two separate occasions, and I think this is the finest steak house in America.  On my last visit I had a 16 ounce bone-in filet that was awesome.   This is one of the few places I know that serves the Florida Stone Crab claws. The first time I had them I was amazed at how sweet and fresh the claw meat taste. I have eaten my share of crabs, and I think these claws are by far the best. They are served with a unique, sweet mustard sauce.  The stone crab claws are considered sustainable seafood. This means the seafood is harvested with consideration of the environment and the future of the species. The stone crabs are found in the waters along the coast of south Florida. Fishermen catch and release the crab after taking one of it's claws. The second claw is left intact so the crab can survive while it regenerates the missing claw. It is nice to know that steps are being taken to preserve the futre of stone crabs, and that a crab didn't die in vain.  I don't know much about wine but I know what I like.  I enjoyed a bottle of Silver Oak Cabernet. My friend knows a little more about wine, and this was a great choice.",

The oysters are so fresh, delicate and tasty. There is NO question that they are extremely high-quality. I could've eaten a dozen more of these bad boys.  The chef split our soup up for us into two cups, which was very nice of him to do. It is silky, rich, and seasoned just right. I think a whole bowl would be too much for me though because it is very rich.  Our steaks were a bit more on the rare side, rather than MR but we didn't mind because they tasted so damn good. The lobster tail is grilled and split for you, and the meat was so tender and had a delicious buttery flavor. We also ordered creamed spinach, which I didn't care for but I'm not a creamed spinach fan. We also got a side of mac n cheese, of course, and it too was delicious.  Joe's promises to always be a great experience and this was no different. I was impressed by the food, service, and ambiance as I always am when I come here. It will always remain one of my all-time favorite steakhouses. Yum!",

The waiter was very sweet and catered to our every needs, even with an infant in tow, he treated her like she was an adult.   They brought out the bread bowl, with assorted breads, all different kinds and all so delicious! We were getting full from just the bread!   To start, my husband had a glass of red wine and we ordered the oysters rockefeller, they were out of this world! Very filling though! I ordered the colossal crab cakes for my main dish and was surprised it was only two crab cakes, kind of disappointed, but realized after the first bite that it's very filling, all crab meat and not much filler! Just how I like it!!! My side of sweet potatoes and rice was also out of this world! My husband had a french dip sandwich and that was also very delicious! Sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked!   What a wonderful place to stop in for a great meal! Great service, great ambiance! We'll be stopping by again! Fine dining food without having to necessarily get dressed up!!!",

I don't eat seafood but I tried the stone crab and it was pretty good. My boyfriend and our friend got a second order because they couldn't get enough. Joe's sauce that they serve it with is excellent! I even dipped my vegetables in it! The steaks were cooked to perfection and side dishes were delicious too.

The sides were creamed spinach (bleh not very good) and the lyonnaise potatoes which are basically hash browns with onions (you could honestly get them at a breakfast place and that would do the trick).

    "text": "I found Joe's on Yelp and thought I would give it a try. Before the meal they brought out a good selection of bread which was fresh and tasty. The waiter John was very friendly and made several good entree suggestions. I chose the surf and turf - filet mignon and lobster tail. Unfortunately as soon as I cut into the steak I knew it was cooked medium to almost well done rather than medium-rare as I requested. I showed it to John who took it back and within 5 minutes returned with another filet that was perfect. It actually turned out to be one of the most juicy and flavorful steaks I've had in years. The lobster was also tasty but not very hot. The potato was flaky and very very hot which was great because I like to load it up with plenty of butter and sour cream To make up for the first steak, John offered a free dessert and cappuccino which were both excellent. Though it was a bit disappointing to have to send a steak back, the replacement made up for it and so I will be back to try Joe's again.",

When they aren't in season, they are frozen, and the decline in quality can't be overstated.    On more than one occasion, we have skipped seafood and had burgers.  The burgers are highly recommend, particularly when you add blue cheese.  They don't always have mac n cheese, but when they do it's a very good representation of this dish.  The shrimp cocktail are huge and the sauce is fantastic.  Good bar, nice beer and liquor selection.   For dinner, I recommend reservations.  Even lunch can take awhile at this place due to its popularity.",

It was pretty cool. Our server gave us recommendations and told us we could share most of the sides. We ended up mostly getting steaks and a sole. We also got an order of the crab claws and king crab. The stone crab claws were really juicy and the king crab legs were big. Pretty expensive for the portion but it's worth it.  The steak tartare had a very tart flavor from the capers and came with toasted croutons. It was a generous size and tasted good.  The filet mignon was ok. Was pretty standard.  For the sides we got cauliflower, broccolini, Brussel sprouts, hashed browns, and Mac and cheese. The vegetable portions were pretty small. We could each only get one piece of each. The Mac and cheese was okay. I really liked the hashed Browns though. Some of my group thought it was too salty but I enjoyed the flavor.",

Originally my mom wanted to take me to some fancy schmancy restaurant at the Bellagio, but parking was ridiculous that night and alas she didn't make any reservations... :I So we ended up here. I had no expectations whatsoever but my mom was in a pissy mood. So we get here and the \"patio\" seating was currently closed off because the outside doors nearby were open and letting in a freezing wind and the patio wasn't heated. So we were seated inside at this tiny table sitting on high bar stool leveled seats and my mom threw a fit to our waiter venting how it was \"ridiculous that the patio isn't heated\" and how it was \"my daughter's 25th birthday and was supposed to be special\" giving off this snotty vibe like this place was just SO beneath her. I felt so bad and so embarrassed because it's not like it was his problem. But he apologized and brought his manager over and the manager handled my mom amazingly (bless his poor soul, ugh) and apologized and gave us a discount and completely surprised me by bringing me a complimentary alcoholic beverage AND an ice cream and brownie sundae with a candle and everything. WOW talk about amazing service, when he had every right to disregard my mom's horribleness. Even with the discount and free stuff, our bill was over $300...to be honest I do not think the food was worth the price so i like to think we paid for amazing customer service. Many thanks and many apologizes to the waiter and manager!!!!!!!!! (unfortunately I don't remember their names)",

Madagascar Shrimp lightly grilled, with key lime aioli to dip it in on the side. Each piece is approximately a 1/4 lb, yes they are huge, and meaty, and well in one word, incredible. What I described is solely an appetizer, but I decided to make it my main course along with a side of their roasted Brussels Sprouts.   I was too full to order dessert, but according to my friend, their pies are phenomenal, and the calories don't count if you're eating their pie because it's just so heavenly. Maybe I'll pace my self better and indulge in their pie, the next round. For sure, I will be back. There is no way I'm going to skip dining here again.   Signing out,   Mz. Fancy Pants in Vegas.",

My wife wasn't happy to see that I actually enjoyed it because that meant less for her!  They were very creamy and had great flavor--sort of tasted like a creamed spinach dish.  We also had the creamed spinach and mac/cheese as side dishes.  Both were pretty good and very flavorful.  The mac/cheese definitely didn't disappoint if you are a cheese lover.  For entrees, we order the fried shrimp and Crab stuffed shrimp dishes.  Both were pretty solid, I wouldn't say they were the best we've ever had.  All in all, this was a very nice dining experience.",

Steak and/or lobster is the way we usually roll. Amazing breads and cornbread.  Service is always excellent and Bobby the bartender is a Legend.  There's something good on the menu for everyone. Expect $45 to $70 per person to do it right.",

    "text": "Truly disappointing! Let's start with the service. Our server was just a blow hard. He put the hard sell on the stone crab which is really overpriced and virtually impossible to eat after being obliterated in the kitchen. The crab was hit with the mallet so hard that is was infused with countless little pieces of shells. Not good eats. We picked a California \"Cabernet\" from the wine list. The server boasted that it was a big full flavored cab. The sommelier actually hid the bottle from us when she poured. Once we agreed that the wine wasn't turned, the sommelier ran off. Reading the bottle it was obvious that it was a blend and not a True cab. The server kept calling our wives \"young ladies\" which is fine if you don't repeat it about 19 times during the meal. It just got awkward after a while. The fish entree's were luke-warm at best and my friend's filet was sizzler quality. My ribeye was actually cooked and seasoned perfectly salvaging the second star. There are so many great places in Vegas. Don't waste a night at Joe's.",

The oysters were still attached to the shell and they were very either very small or had a HUGE muscle. The bisque was watery and didn't have any crab in it..and the fried camalari was just ok not impressive. The shrimps and scallops ceviche was good but I was surprised that they didn't cut the seafood at all - first time in my life I had a ceviche with full shrimp/scallop. All the plates looked sloppy and rushed. At the end, we got a raspberry pie that it was cold and full of gelatin..I really wanted to like this place but eve thing was less than average and not cheap.

In terms of food, the stone crab is a must-try once because of how it's different from your everyday crab. For the price though, I prefer a king crab. The oysters rockefeller were decent. For the main course, I had the crab cakes (lumps of crabmeat-- super important!) and I would get that again. The BF had the assortment of grilled seafood which was great but something we felt we could make ourselves. An okay option-- hopefully you have better service than we did.",

For the main course I ordered the surf and turf, Maine lobster and bone-in Prime aged filet mignon.   The lobster was overcooked and rubbery.

I've had Joe's multiple times and the quality of the food is consistent. The king crab claws are also very fresh and sweet.   The tomahawk steak is also great too! The meat is seasoned well and is a great dish to eat if you have stone crabs too.   The banana cream pie is so die for if you have a sweet tooth! Though it is pretty sweet, three or four big bites of this pie is perfect. The cream is so fluffy and pairs well with the cake itself.   The atmosphere of the dining room is more proper and elegant, great for family dinners or date night. For a more casual meal, I would eat in the bar area or the tables outside.",

It was awesome. Lots of crab meat piled high was a definite plus! So good you don't want to miss that treat! Hubby was loving the pretzel bread and Neal brought out another basket with just that! Entrees were fried chicken for my beloved and crab cakes for me. Probably a few eye brows raised at the fried chicken but he received half a chicken, crispy golden brown and full of taste. He was pleasantly surprised! The crab cakes had so little filler that they just separated with the slight touch of my fork! So delicious! We selected the key lime pie for dessert. Of course, we were pleasantly stuffed so we shared the pie. No disappointment there either! Just the right amount of flavor without being overly sweet. Neal provided each of us with a glass of champagne to celebrate our special day! Top shelf service and an awesome meal, too!",

    "text": "We had a taste for seafood and steak and this place hit the spot. Located on the Vegas Strip inside of one of the hotels/casino, this restaurant was awesome. With outdoor/indoor seating, this place was a mix of modern day/upscale/traditional all mixed in one. The staff are extremely professional and formal. The maitre'd lays the napkin in your lap, cleans your table after each course, and couples it with a hand washing experience. Very classy! The menu was awesome with a great mix of seafood and steak selections. Most items are sold separately and the sides can be added. The beauty in this setup is that the sides are large enough to share between two people. We started with their soup, salad, and bread. All of thee above were marvelous! A garden salad, paired with a crab bisque soup was perfect. The crab cakes and steak were cooked to perfection. We decided to pair it with mac n cheese and brussel sprouts. Again...delicious.  Afterwards, we were way too stuffed to try their desserts but they looked scrumptious. Although we had our own meals, the dishes that came by our table were to die for! Stuffed lobster tails, king crabs...  As I always say when I've had a great dining experience...I will return.  Way to go!",

They are actually expanding this location and they cant finish renovations soon enough.   The servers always start off telling you about the crab claws and as i dont eat shellfish i always find it presumptuous but i let them finish their speil. I always try something new when i come and ive had some misses but mostly hits. The branzino is out of this world but dont expect the whole fish brought to the table. it was neatly fileted and i ate every bite.  This time i had the fried chicken and i heard a lot about it so i had to try it. some people will swear up and down its a must try and its tasty and crunchy but super salty. i could only finish two pieces before i threw in the towel. the fish and chips were nothing to write home about. they are a good stand by and done well.  as far as sides id pass on the bland Joannes mashed potatoes. The lyonaise potatoes are outstanding as well as the hashbrown, the wedge and the house salad!  The key lime pie is phenomenal but ours was cold as ice and the banana cream pie is great just ask for more pecans on the side if you like the crunchy texture.  Would i go back? absolutely but id choose the earlier seating time of 5 or 6 o clock.",

Joe's was tender and juicy as it should be rather than hard and dry.    The difference in how seafood is prepared can be measures in minutes.  One minute too long and it is not juicy.  Takes a chef to do it right rather than a cook.  Will be back again.",

    "text": "Excellence. Just pure excellence from start to finish.    My only regret:  Not coming here sooner!  (I've lived in Vegas for over ten years!)  One order of the large stone crab to start was shared between my family and myself.  Throw away anything you knew about delicious crab.   This was the absolute most delectable, satisfying, piece of crab to have graced its way onto my tongue.  Paired with the mustard sauce, a.k.a. crack sauce, and you'll experience a high unlike any other and you'll probably wonder why Nevada even needed to legalize marijuana when this is so much better.  Next let's talk about that chilean sea bass.   What the hell?  Did this come from the sea or from the heavens above?!    It was so good.   I ordered this based on other Yelper's reviews and just \"wow\".   Topped with a miso glaze, the subtle sweetness is like a protective coating for the delicate fish as it discovers safe passage through your mouth, down your esophagus and into your stomach.  Perfect fish dish.  Truly on point.  10/10 will order again and again.  Now.  About that 24oz bone-in ribeye.   My body just almost shut down thinking about it's greatness.  It's almost as if I am not worthy to eat it.   Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned; it was the most juiciest steak I've ever eaten in a very, very long time.  In fact, I recommended Joe's to a friend and well-seasoned traveler/foodie from Europe last week and he messaged me almost immediately raving about how amazing his steak was.   It was out of this world good.  I'm almost convinced that this was the best steak I've eaten in my life.  I'm licking my lips and painfully strategizing my next 'special occasion' to find a way back to this restaurant.  It's pricey yes, but worth every damn penny.   The service was spot on despite how busy the restaurant became.  The food; truly 5 stars. It's as good as it gets.",

The waiter mixed up how my wife and I wanted our steaks cooked, resulting in mine being overdone.  I normally don't complain, but it was a 60 dollar steak.  They took care of it and made a new one ASAP.  The bone in tenderloin was very good, as was the steak and lobster.  The Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had.  My only complaint is that we were sitting at a table outside the restaurant, basically in the shopping area.  Kind of ruins the ambience at a place in this price point.  But overall it was excellent, and I'd definitely go again.",

Yes the stone crabs are flown in daily and  impeccably fresh, the mustard dipping sauce is delicious and the key lime dangerously sinful. Yet the Vegas location lacks something that their original flagship location just oozes... The loud calamity of hundreds of patrons cracking open claws, rauccous laughter and the glee of large tables feasting and the bustle of waiters and busboys hauling in tons of seafood and platters. The lack of theatrics of its main location, it helps demonstrate how important the fanfare and 'experience' side of dining can sometimes be. There's just something odd about eating their famous $80 stone crabs while seated and looking at people come down the elevator in America's most exspensive mall.All said and done, its great food located on the lower floor of the Forum Shops, and fairly exspensive, though if youre purchasing anything in the Forum Shops to begin with, price probably isnt an issue for you,",

(Good tip that I got from my friend Holly) Best sweet potato fries in town, kusshi oysters and jumbo shrimp cocktails are great for starters. Havana dream pies and chocolate fudge pies are always a treat for dessert. the apple pie a la mode's crust is awesome but the apples are usually on the bland side. trust me all the pies are a treat just chose one to your liking. for service, they always greet you with a smile and Linda and Joey are the best servers, they're really awesome, sit with Linda if you want the most sweet and charming British lady and Joey if you want a down to earth no hassle good ol city Joe.

The reason for not giving more stars rest solely on the service. Our waiter was so rude and seemingly annoyed with us that it made our evening unenjoyable. I generally let things slide when it comes to dining - I am not a \"complainer\" - but this experience resulted in me having words with the manager about our treatment. I wasn't looking for a handout or discount - I waited until after the meal to say something - but our waiter's behavior was terrible. I am generally a good tipper, but that night, all he got was 10%.  While we did enjoy our food, I can pretty much guarantee that I will not be dining at Joe's again. If you are in Vegas and want a great meal with fantastic service, go to Andre's at the Monte Carlo instead.",

    "text": "So, my friend and I went to Miami, and we wanted to go to the original Stone Crab loc.  The Miami location is seasonal with its stone crabs, so we didn't go.  When I found out about the Las Vegas location, I called to find out that they have stone crabs year round. :D so my next Vegas trip, my friend definitely wanted to go.  We unfortunately got back from camping later than expected and my friend called to make a reservation.  We didn't end up at the restaurant until 9.  When sat down, the waiter immediately told us that they ran out of stone crabs.  WTF!!!! WHY THE HELL ARE WE THERE FOR??!!?  I was so angry and disappointed, I wanted to walk but we were so starving we stayed.  Why couldn't they have told us that when we made the reservations?! Of course not.  EVIL. evil.  So we ended up ordering a bunch of seafood, crab cakes (delicious), calamari (nothing great, a bit disappointing actually), some different crab claws (Jonah crab claws) , which were sweet still and pretty good, some scallops (really buttery and rich..too much) and garlic shrimp which could have been more garlicky.  It was an underwhelming dinner, but dessert made up for it....you can order half slices, but it's still a pretty huge slice.  I'm not a fan of key lime pie, but it's what they're known for, and it's not bad.  and their Havana dream pie....OOOOOO MMMMGGGGGG it was A DREAM....similar to tres leche cake, it was smooth and creamy and the perfect amount of sweet.  OOOOOOOO I wanted a second slice but I was too damn full....I'm dreaming about it. :D maybe next time we can actually try some stone crabs.  And they better be damn good.  :P",

Although some may think the stone crab claws are pricey, they are worth every penny.  The portions are also large.  One menu item in particular which is good for first timers is the Joe's Lunch special -- it comes with the crab claws, Joe's famous coleslaw, hash browns (to die for) and a slice of key lime pie.  This item can easily be shared by two and will give you a good idea of what the food is like.  The service is impeccable and the staff area always very accommodating.  We highly recommend reservations for lunch and dinner as it is always full.  Joe's has become one of our favorites!",

Everything turned out great. The set up and reservation process was smooth sailing, we were able to finalize our reservation via emails back and forth with the restaurant. They even printed our menu out with a customized title at the top, which was a cute added touch. The menu selection for the group order was big (you pick x number of dishes for apps, main and dessert ahead of time) Our server was excellent- attentive and funny and accommodating. They even brought out an extra main dish because they mis-counted.  The food was also really tasty- good filet, crab cakes actually had a ton of crab not filler. I also thought that their per person cost was really reasonable compared to other restaurants on The Strip and the food was really really good- great value.",

    "text": "I love stone crab, but this location was a little disapointing for me.  I could go on all day about the Jumbo stone crab claws that I had in Miami, in Vegas it was just ok.  They were out of the jumbo claws and maybe the large because we ended up just getting the mediums, you really can taste the difference.  In Miami the sweet potato fries are thick cut and in Vegas they're shoestrings and I prefer the thick cut.    The garlic creamed spinach is the same.  Do not order the fried chicken!  I had heard so many great things about the chicken , but ended up so disapointed, it was not salted at all so it tasted really, really bad.  I'm sure this locaton loses some of it's charm because it's not in the salty air of  the Miami coast, but there is no excuse for the bad chicken and being out of jumbo claws.  I'll think I'll stick with the Miami location for future. Oh and our server was not very nice.",

    "text": "I tend to favor restaurants with foofoo menus, the kind of stuff I'd never make at home, with ingredients you'd have to have sent from outer Mongolia.  That said, Joe's was fantastic.  It's basically stone crabs, steaks and seafood, but anything but basic.  First of all, I'd give 5 stars just for the best mojitoes I've ever had in my (long) life.  Then the meal:  we shared stone crab claws appetizer with a delicious mustardy sauce.  I had stone crab bisque (seems the thing to do here is enjoy stone crabs) which was ethereal.  My husband had crab cakes which were blue crab meat barely held together in a \"cake \" form, there being little or more likely no breading.  Just sublime crabmeat.  I had a fantastic idea in menu offerings -- lobster tail tempura.  Lobster meat -- 2 large tails.  Deep fried in tempura batter.  What in the name of all that is right and holy could be better than that?!  And did I mention the mojitoes?  We also shared their highly touted, rightfully so, cole slaw and french fried sweet potatoes and still managed to save room for dessert.  Husband couldn't decide between the coconut cream pie or banana cream pie with foster sauce, so awesome server brought both (for price of one).  I had peach pie with melba sauce.  Great location, ambiance and friendly, knowledgeable server.  A great time.",

    "text": "First night on our Honeymoon, we got to Joe's around 10:15pm right before closing at 10:30.  We sat at a table near the bar.  Our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  Other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  The selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my Bacardi and tonic.  For our meal my wife and I decided to share an order of 7 large stone crab claws, shrimp cocktail, oysters Rockefeller, and the Aged 16 oz NY Steak.  Everything, and I mean everything was top notch.  The oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the shrimp cocktail, while not quite Morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the stone crabs.....Words cannot explain how good these were.  Growing up in a Pan-Asian setting in Hawaii, there are very few sea foods that I haven't tried.  From Jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  I've had Dungenous, Maryland Blue, King, Snow, and last night finally, I got to cross Stone crab off my list.  While pricy at about  $60 for 7 Large pieces, they are divine.  Huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  Follow that up with a dip in Joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  And oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  Overall, a great meal, and a great start to our Honeymoon in Vegas.  I would eat here every week if I could, but at $300 including tip, I wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  That being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and I know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but I have been to places in NY and Chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  Last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  Never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  So a little our fault, a little theirs.  Next time we come, I'll make an earlier res, and hopefully the service will be a little sharper.",

Also had salad with bluechees with a delicious vinegarette.  Ordered the Lyonnaise with the carmelized onions on top and the special which was sauteed corn that was soooo sweet.  My date had the filet mignon which was a bit overcooked (hence the 4 stars) but I had the bone-in ribeye which was cooked perfect medium rare with that slight crust on the outside.  Our server was very, very attentive even though he was very busy with a huge 10 top beside us - much appreciated.  Absolutely too stuffed to have dessert but there will be a next time!",

    "text": "I cannot believe this place is called Joe's stone crab just like the one in Miami ? It has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, I have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing I can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example In vegas the clam chowder was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1/3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the stone crabs, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about $ 85dls per order,  20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the stone crabs came they were frozen and not good at all,  a fresh stone crab should not stick to the shell and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the sweet potato fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. If you plan to go to Joe's Do not consider by any means to go to the one in Vegas, It has nothing to do with the original in Miami,  I keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in Miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called Joes stone crab.",

My Buddy and his wife visit Vegas frequently and know many of the Staff at Joes. The rest of us had all been there at least once and were excited to go. The service was good as my buddy knew that waiter and he was very good to us. We all shared a few plates of Stone Crab and it was good, but not great. My brothers and I ordered Steak and to say they were all burn't would be an understatement. They weren't too bad inside, but the strong burn't taste on the outside took away from any positive flavor left in the steak. My youngest brother said something at the table, but my buddies wife made it very clear to him that he \"did not know anything and to not embarass her\". We all kept our mouth's shut and choked down the steaks. On a positive note my wife had Dover Sole prepared at the table and it was Fantastic. It's a shame as Joe's likely would have looked after this miscue, but we didn't have the chance to let them know and after we left none of us were inspired to return again on our next trip to Las Vegas.",

The best bang for your buck is the seafood platter which comes with 3 small lobster tails, maybe 5 large shrimp, and about 5 scallops. I've had the Mac n cheese which was tasty, the sweet potatoes and praline butter is amazing because it's different than what's normally at restaurants. The creamed spinach has a good flavor, the sauteed spinach is made with a lot of garlic but made perfectly.  The customer service is AMAZING!!!",

I felt smooched n rushed as server brought me the check without me asking and before i even started my delicious coffee... they def want to turn the tables fastttttttt.",

    "text": "Great honest food in a traditional - elegant atmosphere with excellent service.  The huge  dining room bathe in  warm gold lighting,  with leather chairs and dark wood looked more more like a fine dinner house in downtown Chicago or NYC than on the strips of Vegas.  The staff draped in tuxedos provided a classy yet down to earth type of service.   We came here last October(2017) for our last dinner on vacation and loved it so much that we decided to do it again and we were even more pleased the 2nd time.  If you're looking for fancy - celebrity chef type of food then this place is not for you. But if you're looking for great steak and seafood executed with tried and True techniques then this place is definitely for you.   The menu is focused on straightforward great quality steak - seafood dishes and sides that complement those dishes. We started the meal with Raw Oysters and Charred Octopus with corona beans and kalamata olives then rolled up our sleeves and dove into Stone Crabs and a Bone - In Filet Mignon.  As mentioned, the food is not complicated yet incredibly delicious because of   the Chef's wisdom to let the fresh and quality ingredients speak for themselves.  The raw oysters and  stone crab were as fresh as if they just came  out of the ocean. The octopus was simple yet tender and delicious. The bone in filet was a big thick juicy cut cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Not too many places carry the bone - in filet mignon.   Equally if not surpassing the great food was the level of service. Our server Linda and her team anticipated our every meed. Our wine/water glass never went empty and all the dishes came out with such perfect timing that we never felt rushed or forgotten.  Linda's style of service should be packaged and taught at fine dining restaurants world wide.  It was a Saturday night and the room was packed, yet she was calm, charming, attentive and in control at all times. She orchestrated her team like a seasoned conductor.   This experience was definitely a great reason to return to Vegas.",

Helpful Tip: If the price isn't published you may want to inquire further with your waiter. I neglected to do so and under estimated how costly these delicious little suckers are. I'm extremely appreciative of my friends for the generous birthday dinner treat  5 large stone crabs approximately $60.00. Delicious and filling these stone crabs served with Joes special mustard was phenomenal!  Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche 16.95   Crab Bisque $9.95 Mixed Greens Salad 9.95 the creamy vinaigrette was soo tasty! Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon 38.95 served medium rare on top of potato cake and wine bordelaise! Oh yes!!!!!!  Baked Sweet potato $8.95 moment of silence for the praline pecan butter  Mac & Cheese $9.95 my least favorite  Way to stuffed for dessert. Already planning a special trip back for the pies I missed out on.   Useful Tip: Forums Shops Top VALET closer to the strip.  Of course I'll be back!",

Our drinks were never empty and crumbs were cleaned from the table after each course - waitress was ready with suggestions and had honest answers to our questions regarding what to order to avoid over-ordering - drinks were small but mighty, I tried the grapefruit martini and mojito. Delicious - complimentary bread basket was a variety of amazingly delicious breads including an everything lavosh, cornbread muffin, soft pretzel bun, dinner roll and rye slices. If we weren't flying out the next day I would have paid for another basket to-go. Sooooo good. - we ordered the whale appetizer which included lobster tails, Alaskan king crab, ceviche, and chips. I'm not sure what's on the chips but they were so good I wanted to order a bowl of that to-go. Seafood was cooked perfect, not rubbery at all. We also ordered stone crab, nothing like we've ever had! Especially with the mustard sauce . Husband ordered the skirt steak with shishito peppers, I ordered a petit filet; both cooked to perfection and by husband really enjoyed the excitement of pepper roulette (hot vs sweet). We only ordered one side- sweet potato with pecan butter. Yes it is as amazing as it sounds! I could eat this for dessert. Speaking of- my husband ordered a (huge) piece of Boston creme pie which even though he was full, he ate all but the last edge. I received a complimentary brownie sundae dessert, so awesome! Of all the places we went for my birthday this was the only place that did this - valet parking $7  Cons:  - bathroom is upstairs so don't have too many drinks   Verdict: added to our list of \"always eat when in Vegas\". My husband wants to eat here as our last dinner whenever we're in town. I have no arguments with that. Highly recommended.",

Some people come to gamble, some come for the entertainment, some for the sporting events or concerts...we come to Vegas for the food. When we were looking for seafood and were on the brink of exhaustion, we found Joe's on the bottom level of the Caesar's Forum Shoppes. Our lunch began with some items off the raw bar (shrimp, crab legs, oysters), salads/soup and proceeded with entrees of the fresh catch of the day. Normally, dessert is never ordered because we are more \"appetizer people\", but it came with our meal, and I must say that it left a lasting impression on us. HAVANA DREAM PIE!!! The server told us that it was the house specialty as well it should be. It looks like a tres leches cake and tastes like heaven. Now everytime we recall our recent trips of the year and all the highlights, Havana Dream Pie from Joe's is noted close to the top.",

The Alaskan king crab is my favorite thing I have had you can get them in the whale or by themselves. Of the things I have had I would say the onion strings and crab roll are my least favorite. The fries are better than the onion strings and the crab roll imo just needs more flavor from the sauce or something. Honestly if I didn't have to pay for parking (don't gamble) I would go here once a month but when you're spending this kind of money on food it really makes me upset to pay for parking as a local.",

The bloody marry was top notch and with the huge shrimp and olive garnish it serves as an app!  You have to order the stone crab claws if you come to this place. They are sweet and buttery, plus the sauce they bring you is to die for.   We opted for 8 claws and also a side order of calamari. I wasnt super impressed with the calamari so just do a double order of stone crab claws!!  We split the porterhouse which was cooked to Perfection and the sidecar of seasoning they bring out that you sprinkle over yourself before you eat it is a must. Be generous with your sprinkle.  For the sides we got a secret menu item called the fat daddy! Lebanese potatoes with all the baked potatoe fixings on top. Omg huge and yummy!   To end it all we got a cup of Joe and the keylime pie. Honestly the crust to the pie was a little mediocre but the rich tart filling satisfied my sweet tooth completely.  Amazing service here as well. Cant wait to come back.",

    "text": "Went here with the hubby on Tuesday night last week, and dinner was wonderful! I am a HUGE seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places I've had in CA or NV.  The food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.  It's located at the very end of the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace on the bottom/street level.  If you are coming from Caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  You'll need to take the escalator down one level.    I tried to make a reservation the day before on Open Table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.  So I called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w/o reservations.  They said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  So I asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.  So we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  At first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  But seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  So our wait was just 20 minutes.  Since I'm from So Cal, I can get stone crabs pretty easily at the Fisherman's Wharf in Redondo Beach or even at 99 Ranch supermarket.  They are fairly cheap to buy whole (Santa Barbara stone crabs are about $5/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  So that's why I didn't get stone crabs at Joe's.  But if you haven't had stone crabs before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and I've had all kinds).  They are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.    Half-dozen oysters (1 order): - I forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  I think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  The oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  I could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.  Fisherman's Platter - Grilled: - I got this and loved it.  It was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  The server told me ahead of time when I asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  With the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  My husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  The seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  The shrimp were big and crunchy.  The squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  The flavor was overall very good.  I would definitely get this dish again.    Lobster-stuffed Sole: My husband got this and loved it.  In fact, I was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that I had.  The sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  The fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.    Jennie's Mashed Potatoes: These were special mashed potatoes that were very good!  They had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  The combination of the mashed potatoes with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  It went perfectly with our meal, and I would definitely get these again.  I don't think I've run into any other place that makes their mashed potatoes like this.  Very good and filling!  Overall, this is a great seafood place.  If there was one of these places in So Cal, I would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  It's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  The service was great and the food was great.  The only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a HUGE group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  Our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  So it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.",

I know Joe's is known for their crab claws and they were the best I have had but I liked the king crab legs better! My steak was really good too.   The service was excellent, atmosphere was very \"Vegas\", action packed, crowded and a bit loud.   We had a great time and would go back!  My rating is 4 1/2, since it's not an option I gave a 5.  (Went to Joe's August 2016- review was in my drafts)",

    "text": "Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm...  This place makes me drool just thinking about it. I love seafood, and with that being said, Joe's has ah-mazing crab legs. I've been here one other time a couple years back and remember the service being impeccable. (Literally, picked up a glass of water and by the time we set it down someone was there to refill it.)  This time we waited about 10-15 minutes after arriving right on time for our reservation at 8:30pm. We were seated in a cozy corner. Suzanne was the one who took care of us and she was great! She really knew the menu and gave us great advice on which wine we should pair with our food.  We ended up ordering a half order of the King Crab Legs as an appetizer, and they cut it fresh at the table. They were so easy to eat; all I had to do was lift off the outer shell and the meat fell out. It was so sweet and succulent. (Haha, another one of those dishes that I couldn't wait to eat, so there is no picture)  Then we had the 12oz Filet Mignon (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uMtv5iEcifz9Jz4yFgtbsA&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) cooked at Medium. They brought it out sliced for us to share (neither one of us were as hungry as we thought). We were also advised by Suzanne that the sides are very big so that we should probably do two half orders. We had corn and mashed potatoes (you see them both in the picture).   Suzanne also had advised that the house wines were great choices, so we ordered a red and a white. (Pinot Noir & Sauvignon Blanc) Both paired wonderfully with our meal.  I'm not sure what they crusted over the mashed potatoes, pretty sure it's something cheesy. But whatever it is, it made the mashed potatoes to die for...  Lastly, for desert we decided to try the Havana Dream Pie (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=s_nMDYnX3GWgbQkpAthbWg&userid=q50PWB-QR1YCHa60kagzgw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I can't remember if she had said it's like or it is Tres Leches Cake. It was pretty good, I'm not big on desserts so it was alright.   Definitely coming back... the service is amazing and the food is even better.   LOVE JOE'S.",

    "text": "Look lady, I have money... I don't know why you keep making us feel uncomfortable about spending it.  I am referring to our waitress who fell into the trap of thinking we couldn't afford the meal at hand. Her explanation of what would be ideal to order was a bit confusing. I did appreciate the story of the restaurant though.  A pretty nifty bread basket comes out before the meal started. We had decided to share the large stone crabs which was enough for 3-4 bites per person (total 5 people). Soon after, our entrees (I got the bone-in ribeye) came out with the delicious sides. The hands down favorite of the table had to have been the garlic spinach which had roasted pieces of garlic on top. The mac and cheese and the fries were good as well. Beware of the salt condiment that comes out with the steak, if you make the mistake of adding just a bit more than you need, your steak can end up like a salt lick.  I'd probably skip over the stone crabs and try their other thing they are known for (Alaskan king crab) and share my steak along with some sides the next time around. In any case, I enjoyed what I ate.",

Seafood is good but not as amazing as Miami..but maybe it's related to the shipping route of the ingredients?   Service is superb. All very professional, friendly, and informative.

Upon being seated we were giving a complementary bread basket and it was very good. For appetizers we ordered the \\Oyster Rockefeller which was kind of over priced for just 4 oysters but they tasted great so it was worth it. For Dinner my wife ordered the filet and tail - which was amazing, and I ordered the select stone crab. For sides we had the French Fries and the wild mushrooms.   We were stuffed and satisfied.

I don't understand how a restaurant like this can screw up a simple order like this. The only thing I can think of is carelessness.  We ordered some crab legs, and they were served before the steaks. They definitely left the steaks on the grill too long! The waiter disappeared before I can complain.  The crab legs were good but pricey. Not impressed, not going back.",

Filet and bone in ribeye for the entre.  Both prepared perfectly and very good.   Recommended sides were Hash Browns and Roasted Corn and did not disappoint. Simple and delicious.   To dessert, we got \"small\" orders of banana creme pie and coconut creme pie. Per the Mrs., banana creme was the best piece of pie she's ever eaten. Both were fresh and wonderful. You have to pay a little to eat here, but you certainly get what you pay for.",

Had some appetizers: Calamari was subpar, grilled seafood platter was okay, and ahi tuna tartare was pretty good which had these huge chips to eat with it. Shared the 30 oz porterhouse which was good but since we ordered it medium rare the meat was kind of chewy and it was overcharred for my taste after awhile. We found it tasted more tender and tasty with some cooked medium. Tried our friend's ribeye which was pretty tender. Sides were nothing special: mac n cheese, fried asparagus and mashed potatoes weren't memorable. Overall it was good but not great. I would still come back when I visit Vegas again.",

    "text": "Dinner at Joe's was half tasty. We got to Joe's without a reservation at 6:30. The host told us it would be 30 minutes, but actually had a table for us in 10 minutes. The problem however was that our table was in the over crowded bar and not in the restaurant in the back. We literally had a group of guys leaning on our table for about 10 minutes during our meal. The atmosphere was abhorrent.  The only thing worse than the atmosphere was the service. Our waitress seemed grumpy and unhappy. We ran out of butter for our pre dinner bread, our food took forever to come out and when we were done our meal we waited for lemon water or hot towels, but ended up going got the bathroom to wash our hands. The hot towels arrived approximately 5 minutes after we were done eating. When I am done eating crab I don't want to wait 5 minutes to wipe my hands down. In my opinion the hot towels in a high end steak and seafood joint should be brought out 5 minutes before you are done, not after. The meal itself was ok. The only thing I would get again was the medium stone crab. We got some of the large and medium, there wasn't much difference in size, and they tasted the same. I think you get more meat for less money with the medium. The mustard sauce they are served with is really good. We ordered fries and onion rings to go with them, the fries were decent, but nothing to write home about. The saddest onion rings in the world are onion straws, and that is what we got. I wanted a solid steakhouse onion ring and instead I got an over salted mess of greasy thin cut onions. Overall Joes gets a pass from me, but if I was to go back I would have a reservation for the restaurant and I would take a pass on half of what I ordered.",

    "text": "First of all, been dreaming of trying stone crab ever since I saw a feature on a food show! So when I had a chance to try it in Vegas at the very  restaurant I saw it on 5 years ago, (the original is in Miami ) I did not hesitate. Mind you this is my thanksgiving dinner,and expectations were quite high. We were greeted warmly and from the beginning treated like we were valued guests. Our waiter whose name is Perry deserves 6 stars because he was probably the best waiter I  have encountered in my life. He passion for food  and friendly advice made our experience unparalleled. Now let actually talk about the food.  They started us of with a bread basket which contains 4 different selections, the  best in my opinion was the cracker bread followed closely by the pretzel roll. We ordered spinach stuffed  mushrooms and they are amazing! We both had the select stone crab about  one pound,  and my God  are they delicious. Being from San Francisco I have always thought dungeness crab was the best . But as of right now I give the nod to the stone crab. It is served with Joe's special mustard which is great, but I asked for some cocktail sauce,  which hands down the best I have ever had. For  our  side we tried the lyonais potatoes very good. I really had such a great experience here that I  just had to post a short story of a review to give them the props they deserve.  Special shout out to Perry's bosses your boy  is doing exceptional work and should be recognized!  .",

Woowww! So on Christmas my sister, cousin, a family friend & I decided to come in for an early dinner. Long story short...Strike 1.) I asked our female server(forgot the young ladies name) how her Christmas was going & she said terrible because she had to be at work. Strike 2.) my sister tried to ask our server for something simple as hot tea & she walked away Strike3.) a whole new waitress came over & said she would be taking over. We asked why & she responded our previous waitress said we didn't like her. Like whoah! We would never say anything like that or treat anyone like that especially on Christmas.  Strike 4.) our new waitress brought up us going to a strip which I thought was totally inappropriate specially with an elder sitting at our table We tipped good even though I felt this visit was bizarre & uncomfortable. At least our food was good, Merry Christmas to us  I went back and Bridgett was our fabulous waitress. They took care of me and my friends really well. Thanks to the management he was great.  The food is soooo good I've come a few times. My last visit wasn't so great. The waitress wasn't so friendly and did not work with me well. I asked to substitute one minor item (scallops) for maybe another piece of shrimp. She acted as if they never given substitutes or have heard of such a thing. I just changed my order to something else because I didn't want to bother anymore. It was just a friend and I for lunch. We gave her a great tip even though she was unfriendly and not very accommodating. Luckily our food was wonderful or I would've been one unhappy camper. Great food and nice place... With the exception of the brunette lunch time waitress.",

    "text": "Everything about dinner at Joe's was awesome. Especially on Valentines Day.  We had reservations but were running late. We called and they allowed us to push it back 30 min. Who's ever on time in Vegas right?  Oysters Rockefeller = Great appetizer! Stone crabs = Great appetizer!  Im sure any steak would be good there. Had the 12oz filet, medium.  And guess what? It was perfectly cooked medium. I could use a butter knife to cut my steak!  Then, when you think it couldn't get any better, our waiter brought over some steak spices. Just a tiny sprinkle on top of your meat and the flavor explodes! From that point on I cut my steak into even smaller bits and savored each one for some extra time. We nicknamed the spices \"Steak Cocaine!\"  Great night! Could not have started off a better night in Las Vegas without eating dinner at Joe's first.",

We were greeted by the host who wasn't very friendly, quoted us an hour wait which would've meant we were sat right when they closed? Didn't ask if we would like to sit at the bar? There was plenty of seats. We asked if we could eat at the bar and he said yes. When we got to the bar the gentleman bartender was nice, got us menus asked if we wanted drinks. The lady bartender seemed annoyed that we were there. She wasn't friendly at all at first! She was nice tho giving one of the waiters shots...Threw our meal she became more enjoyable especially when she dropped the check.  The food on the other hand gets 5 stars! We had crab stuffed shrimp for appetizer that made my tongue cry tears of joy! I had the chilean sea bass that was interesting, it had a miso glaze, very different for me. My husband had a steak that melted in my mouth! So soft, juicy, tender, and amazing!",

I ordered a special of Beef Wellington...yum.  The steak was correctly prepared.  I started with one large stone crab claw that I very much enjoyed.  My companion ordered medium crab claws and was allowed to order fewer than a normal order.  She enjoyed them but did say it was difficult to get the meat out.  It was her first time to try these so she may not have been familiar enough!  We were too full for dessert.  I'd return in a heartbeat!  Expensive but worth it.",

I'm not sure why they say they have no reservations available, but on the OpenTable app they had a lot available. We started our meal with appetizers. The stuffed mushrooms and octopus were pure heaven. We also ordered the bisque and they willingly split the two bowls into 4 cups so everyone in my family could get a taste. The Chilean Sea Bass was flavorful, moist and the perfect size. My husband got the ribeye steak bone in and it was cooked medium to perfection. Our waiter was very patient, informative and attentive, but not overwhelmingly so. He talked us into trying the home fries and sweet corn as side dishes. The corn was delicious, especially with a twist of lime. I wasn't too impressed with the home fries which were presented like mashed potatoes, but the potatoes were fried first. They were a bit bland but they gave you a generous portion. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and although we were too full for dessert, our waiter surprised us with a free dessert and a candle for my husband to blow out. It was such a kind gesture!",

It was a lot of work finishing it, and I neglected the sides doing so, but it too was delicious. For sides we ordered hashed brown potatoes and creamed corn.

    "text": "Looking for eating options in Vegas and I can not tell you how STOKED I was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  I tried Joe's Stone Crab in Miami, Florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  This is their sister restaurant.  AND NOW I HAVE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE US! Ok, it's not quite in LA...but it's doable.  It's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the Caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  Made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.    Service was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  The staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  And the food came out QUICK! I love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.  Now on to the food: BREAD: You get an assortment of bread.  Our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  Load up on the carbs (:  HOT CHOCOLATE: It was so delicious.  None of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  Really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  YUM!  CRAB BISQUE: The size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  I love their presentation.  You're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  I don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. Flavor is nothing short of what I expected.  MEDIUM STONE CRAB: Our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  You still have to take off the shell of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  A MUST ORDER while eating here.  JUMBO ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS: Ugh this was amazing! Another MUST ORDER!! The meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. Dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. Too good!!  COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE:  This was the only dish that we ordered that I could have lived without.  It was good, but I just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.  ALASKAN KING CRAB ROLL:  I will totally order this again.  It's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  They stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).  SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD:  This is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  This salad comes with the Alaskan Crab, Lobster, and Shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  It's so good. Like wow good. Wow.  WILD MUSHROOM MAC & CHEESE:  It is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  One side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.  KEY LIME PIE: THE ONLY key lime pie I've ever liked was at the Joe's in Miami. And they serve it just as good here. It's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). Just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!  I can't rave about this place enough. One of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here.   SIDENOTE: You can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested! (:",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE, and don't get me started about the great service too!   I've been to Joe's in Miami (the original), Chicago, but the one here in Vegas multiple times and that will continue because the food is 5-Star and the service is 5-Star as well and that combo makes for a happy tummy and keeps the wife off my back.  The steaks are always juicy and cooked to perfection especially with all bone-in choices, the stone crab claws are the best and fresh daily, and the last time we had the Alaskan king crab they were the size of my arm, and that's no lie, just ask Suzanne the only server to ask for, we let her select all of our choices for us and shes never done us wrong yet and we will continue to do so as long as we keep coming back.  All the sides are huge and can easily be shared as well.  And I forgot to mention the bread they start you off with, it's outstanding and still warm becasue it's baked daily.  Don't even get me started on the desserts either!  The keylime pie is to die for as are all their pies.  The pies are so good that for the last two (2) years we've been pie of the month club members here and that's all I'll say about that.  You really can't go wrong coming here for any occasion because it's always a celebration of great food and service, and I could go on an on, but my reservation here again is in 15 minutes, so I gotta run now!",

We gave Joe's a call asked on a recommendation from one in our group.  They said they could take us right away, yay!  Our server, Daniel, is possible one of the best servers I've ever had.  Knowledgable, funny, efficient, and great at giving advice.  I originally decided on the stone crab given its in their name but he highly recommended the king crab. He made it sound so great I threw caution and my wallet in the wind and went for it!  Best decision ever.  The portion I ordered was a guaranteed minimum of 1 1/2 lbs but really it was more like 2 lbs!!!!  Even better, they crack it for you table side, such a cool presentation.    You'll never have sweeter, plumper, or bigger pieces of king crab.  So worth it, thank you Daniel and Joe's!!!",

    "text": "Excellent experience. Our vegas party researched a few restaurants and this was the only one who had the courtesy to not push a prix fix menu or a minimum food requirement because of our large party of 11 people.  We made a reservation and was seated pretty quickly. It was nice and quiet with low lights so we could actually have a conversation, I felt very grown up. The service was impeccable, and the food great. They initially served a bread basket which was average. We ordered the stone crab claws and shared as an appetizer, and in retrospect, as a crab lover I should have just gone with this as my entire meal. Still, I had the seared scallops which were very good with a potato puree and an amazing lobster buerre blanc sauce. My husband had the sea bass which was SO moist and good. We also ordered 5 sides and shared with everyone. I think the wild mushroom mac and cheese was my favorite, though we tried lyonnaise potatoes, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and brussel sprouts as well.   It was a friend's birthday and they were nice enough to serve a chocolate dessert with a candle on it. I also had a glass of malbec which was delightful and hubs had a grapefruit-y cocktail. All in all, I think I'd like to come back and just gorge myself on the stone crab claws.",

I was so full from the bread basket, oysters, lobster, and stone crabs -- and that was just our appetizers.  We also got the clam chowder, which is tomato based FYI, the seafood salad was a surprising portion and very light.  For my entree, I got the dover's tail special (?).  I might have spelt that wrong but everything was delicious.  So delicious - I didn't have room for dessert which is absolutely ridiculous for me.  Service and food are exceptional -- and it puts quite a dent in your wallet.  Without a doubt worth it.    I would definitely come back to Joe's EVERY time I am in Vegas now.    Next time though, I'll order dessert FIRST.",

For Joe's, however, I made a rare exception and took our waitress's advice to order the king crab legs rather than the stone crab. Talk about a good choice: 20 ounces of the most delectable, savory crab meat you could find south of Juneau. I'm afraid Todai will just never be the same for us...sniff, sniff.  Top that off with great bread & sides (we opted for the garlic creamed spinach), and amazing pies for dessert (try either the banana cream or the key lime), and it made our trip to Vegas. No wonder this place was packed solid.  One word of warning: be careful about ordering drinks at the bar. The bartender working the Saturday shift likes to vary the price of drinks based on how much he likes the cut of your jib.",

But, I thought maybe my tastebuds weren't \"matured\" yet so I'll give it another shot.  The stone crab was better than I remembered, but still not worth the $ - my favorite part being the mustard sauce that they served with it.    My girlfriends and I shared all three cuts of their bone-in steaks (NY, filet, rib-eye), sweet potatoe fries, mac and cheese, and sweet corn.  The only cut that really stood out was the bone-in filet, which was perfectly cooked and was tender, juicy, and flavorful.    Overall, the dining experience was pleasant, but I do have one major gripe.  As other yelpers mentioned, it's not exactly the cheapest place to eat, which I expected, but for the same reason, I also expected a high level of professionalism and service.  By the time we finished dinner, it was only 6:30 so the restaurant was pretty empty.  It was obvious that nobody was waiting to be seated at our table immediately.  I was pretty pissed when the bussers started to clear our table while we were working on splitting the bill.  It led to us having to reach over them and they having to reach under us, just a big mess everywhere.  Couldn't even get my purse without having to dodge around them.  Left a bad impression for an otherwise decent dinner.",

The sweet sauteed browned glaze went perfectly with the lightness of this fish. Melt in your mouth.kind of fish. :).   It was paired with a light garlic bok choy , very tender, with a  slight crisp when cut into. I would definately have this again.

It is a very busy restaurant. The tables are all quite close together & they have multiple rooms here. The name has always deterred me from putting this place \"on my go to  list\"..or at least, not on my top 10....this place is anything but casual..excellent food, service & dining experience.

The maitre d was okay... not super friendly but not a complete dousche... and he had to ID me before sitting in the lounge because he thought I wasn't 21 yet. I'm flattered. Anywho... didn't get any appetizers as nothing seemed appealing... so we went straight into dinner.   My friend ordered the fried seafood platter which she liked... she let me sample some of it... and honestly to me, it was just fried seafood. Nothing fancy.  I was caught between the shrimp scampi (I heart scampi) and the parmesan halibut. The waitress suggested the scampi so I ordered that and I also got a small portion of the king crab mac and cheese... as I LOVE king crab and I LOVE mac and cheese. I also ordered a blush wine and I don't know the name of it (I asked the waitress and SHE didn't even know... um... FAIL!!!) but it was delicious so I'll shut up about that. The scampi came, and well, it looked sad. Yes the shrimp was large, but it was overcooked and there was NO taste to the pasta. Seriously??  A restaurant of this caliber with this reputation and the scampi has NO taste?? Unimpressed. Also, the king crab mac and cheese had no taste as well. I'm not a fan of adding salt to ANY dish... but I felt like BOTH dishes needed salt but like I said, I don't like to add salt. There was BARELY any king crab in the dish as well. LAME!!! I was completely disappointed and unimpressed with the food AND the service. My friend wanted to order another drink but our waitress never came around. We should'e went to N9NE at the Palms.... where we originally intended to go, but since she was staying at Caesars and we heard great things about Joe's we came here. BLAND food, MEDIOCRE service = a WASTE OF MONEY. Never again Joe's. NEVER AGAIN.",

    "text": "Need a place to eat on a guys trip to Vegas? This place has it all and isn't going to break the bank like some other places in Vegas.  We got a reservation for eight on a saturday night with little trouble on our own, no thanks to our incompetent Concierge at the Mirage.  We started out with drinks and a bottle of wine. A variety of bread and rolls were on the table when we sat down, everything from dinner rolls to rye to brown bread.   Our waiter was the man. He steered us away from the 2nd Mortgage appetizer and basically told us the only two things we needed were the stone crab claws and the king crab legs. We were not disappointed. The mustard sauce that came with the claws was fantastic. The claws and legs were all pre-cracked/opened for easy consumption...  For dinner, most of us had steak. I had the bone in tenderloin (they didn't have a porterhouse, but this is essentially half of one). It was a prime steak and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The lamb and pork chops looked excellent as well.   We didn't save room for dessert, but the key lime pie looked very good...",

    "text": "I usually have to stop here at least once every time I make the trip out to Las Vegas.  Came in on the first night of a 6 day trip and decided to have Joe's for dinner.  For a Saturday night there was no wait and we were seated immediately.  The usual variety bread/pastry basket is brought to the table at the beginning of the meal.  For the entree I decided to have the Select Stone crab claws.  According to our waiter, the Select Stone crabs are a bit larger than the medium and the shells are less \"grainy\".  For our side dishes we had the garlic spinach, lyonnaise potatoes, and a creamed spinach.  Select Stone Crabs - 6 claws per order and they were delicious as usual. The crab meat a has a very light and sweet taste to it. Served with their signature mustard sauce.  If you don't know about stone crabs then you're really missing out.  These are from the Gulf of Mexico where they harvest remove one of the claws from the stone crab and throw it back in the water for it to re-generate its missing claw.    Garlic Spinach - sautee'd with A LOT of garlic.  I am a garlic lover myself but the garlic was a little too overpowering to go with the sweet flavor of the stone crab.  This is probably a good dish if you order a red meat dish.  Lyonnaise Potatoes - These are one of my favorite side dishes of any restaurant.  The potatoes are soft and somewhat scalloped, lightly seasoned, and browned for a crispy upper crust.  Creamed Corn - The corn has sweet taste to it with just the right amount of cream and just the right amount of corn.  All in all a great dining experience and a perfect start to any Vegas trip for me.",

Other high-end steakhouses can't seem to give me the medium-rare that I always request -- and so I always end up disappointed with a bland medium-well.  What the heck, right??!  Isn't it your JOB to know how to cook a steak??   Come on now!  But Joe's...WOW...that steak was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The meat was extremely tender and cooked exactly medium-rare.  There was not a single thing I did not like about it.  The sides of mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach were absolutely scrumptious.  Ended the dinner with their coffee (served in a nice little mini kettle so it's actually about 3 cups) which I must say was very good as well.  What makes this place even better were their more than reasonable prices and excellent service.  Awesomeness.",

I had their specialty- the stone crab.  I like the idea that the crabs don't have to die for my meal... Because they only take one claw- and they grow it back.  But... I eat meat... So... One meal- eh- *shrug*.  My rating of the stone crab is... Get the crab legs!  They crush the claws- and there's a bunch of small pieces of shell in about 25% of your bites- kind of annoying.  The claws are served with mustard- which was good... But I prefer drawn butter with the crab flavor!  All in all- a great experience.... Get the king legs... Enjoy!!",

We started with a bottle of En Route Pinot noir. The wine mark-ups are high. We spilt an order of oysters Rockefeller and a Caesar salad. Would give the oysters a 5 and the Caesar a 4 - good but not special. We then spilt an order of potatoes Lyonaise and the larger fillet. Also got a half-bottle of Paul Hobbs cab to drink with the steak. The potatoes were tasty, and the order was huge. We ordered the filet medium rare but it came out medium to medium well. We should have sent it back, but we almost never do that. Steak was still tasty. Final tab for two with tip was $322. At that price point, need to be perfect on the food to get 5 stars.",

    "text": "So the food here is amazing, the reason for the 4-Star knockoff is on it's way...   I've dined here many times, and I love it, all I really order are the stone crabs and mashed potatoes. The stone crab is moist and juicy and oOoOo so yummy!   Service, they treat you like royalty. Attentive, they have back servers so if your server is no where around they are able to assist you. It's fine dining, it's great. Our favorite server is the one they call 'Grandma'.  The reason for the 4-Star knockoff:  On February 25, 2006 (yes I remember the date, you'll see why) we went out to eat, because we, my (now) husband and I, had become engaged just before heading over to Joe's and we had a reservation, it was a saturday, in the winter time, it wasn't busy. The \"outdoor\" seating area was practically empty and the indoor seating area wasn't busy as well.   Here's what ticked me off... I walk up to the hostess counter, the guy behind the counter, the one with the green bow tie, has been working there, for, FOREVER. He doesn't know who we are, since we only go to this restaurant for special occasions, as this was... Anyway, we tell him that we had a reservation for a party of 3; myself, my (now) husband and my (then 9 y/o) son. The guy writes something down and tells us that \"It'll be a 10 minute wait\". Well, we were there for 34 minutes, yes I counted! There were people that were coming in, after us, that were being seated and we had been waiting there! I assumed that they all had reservations but when one of the people that were seated ahead of us, another party of 3, walked past me to use the restroom, I asked if they had a reservation and they said \"no\". I was FURIOUS, WTF, I just got engaged, I was so happy, way to tick me off!!! I don't know what it was, but my (now) husband at the time tried to calm me down but I used to be in the restaurant industry, I have never done this to anyone, why the hell would they?! They're a fine dining establishment?! I did not understand this crap.  I don't know what it was, could it have been that we had a child with us? (BTW, there were other children dining there, I tried to find some logical reason for this crap) Was is a racist thing? Heck if I know, it doesn't matter what it was, it was WRONG and the end result: because of that, even IF I love their food, they get a 1-Star rating. This situation really upset me, I cringe every time we go there and I see that DB.  Needless to say, this particular night, we ate at another restaurant and it goes to show, bad service can leave a bad impression that can last for YEARS.",

Even though there were about 10 servers milling around I had to get up and go to the bar to get my own drink.  The drink was great, and the atmosphere of the bar and dining room was very nice and welcoming. Sat down to the table and met our waiter who was very nice and gave us the history of the restaurant and suggested some appetizers and entrees since it was our first visit .  We started off with the Stone Crab Claws which were out of this world and the Mustard Dipping Sauce was from the heavens.  We also had the Shrimp De Jonge which was ok. I had the Ribeye which was OK, nothing fantastic.  It was a bit on the small side for a Bone In Ribeye, but since I was still on east coast time so it was really late.  Sweetie had the Sea Bass and liked it.  The side dishes were also very nice we had the Lyonaise Potatoes, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, onion straws and maybe one other, all were tasty. For dessert someone ordered the Peanut Butter Pie which was VERY tasty and to call it rich would be an understatement.  Since there was 10 of us they added a percentage to the bill for a tip, which is normal but then the waiter made a point to let the member of our party that was paying know that he had to share the tip with the other people who participated in our service so it was customary to add more so that he gets his fair share.  I thought this was tasteless and uncalled for he was also pretty persistent about it and it left a bad taste in my mouth. This meal was nice, and I would go back for the stone crab claws.  There were parts that were great and parts that were not so great about this experience.",

I got greedy and also ordered a T-bone steak and basically stuffed myself with one of the most delicious meals I've ever had. I've been craving stone crabs ever since returning home, and will have to get Joe's to ship to the Canadian border to pick up. But totally worth it.",

The ambience in the room was really nice. It is dimly lit with music playing lightly.  Our waiter was very friendly and talked just about anything that came to mind. For appetizers we got the fried calamari, crab cakes and crab bisque. Everything came out delicious especially the crab cakes which had a ton of crab in there so I would recommend it. I got the Chilean sea bass as my main dish. It was good except the miso sometimes overpowered the fish and it made me wish they added a little less.  I really liked the bread bowl that came out with all kinds of bread. Did not have enough room for dessert because we ordered too much.",

The stone crab, which I had never tasted before, was to die for! So easy to eat becasue the shell comes to the table cracked and the mustard-like dipping sauce is a nice addition.  I ordered fish for my main dish, which was nice and tasty, but I wish I'd ordered steak because the taste I had of my boyfriends was delish!  All the side dishes are served al a cart. Make sure to try the mashed potatoes... HANDS DOWN the most increadable mashed potatoes I've ever eaten! TRUST ME, you wont want to share!  Bottom line...

    "text": "This was my first (and last) visit to Joe's.  I have lived in Vegas for eleven years and heard nothing but good things about this place.  So my wife and I took our two friends to dinner there last Friday.        Let's start with the food.  The stone crab claws were really good, very sweet and delicate.  The Kumamoto oysters were good, but not great.  I've had better in Seattle.  My seafood platter was good, but not great as well.  And it came out luke warm and got colder from there.  My wife's crab cakes were tasty but once again, were warm and not hot.  When I go out to eat and spend $600, I EXPECT to be wowed...I was not.      And now on to my motivation to post this review, the service.  Maybe our server was having a REALLY bad day.  Perhaps, her husband couldn't take her attitude anymore and she had just received a divorce text from him merely seconds before she greeted us!  When my wife commented on how fast the oysters came out our server said, \"Yeah, they're oysters.\" In a not friendly tone.  And when I asked to speak with the sommelier because I had a question about the grapes used to make our bottle of wine, she looked at me like I was a complete idiot and walked away to get the somm.  The service was prompt, we never waited for anything and always had everything we needed.  But her attitude was HORRIBLE!!  She never smiled at us once.  She was the most unfriendly server I've ever had.  Here's a little advice to the short blonde server...If you hate your job so much and you have so much disdain for the public, then maybe it's time to look for another job.  Something more befitting your attitude, say perhaps, the DMV.",

We only saw the outer part of the restaurant, which was part of the Caesar Forum Mall. But when we were ushered into the main dining room was when we realized this was a fine dining establishment.  We just HAD to try the Stone Crab Claws, their claim to fame. However, at $10+ for each delectable claw, we thought they were a tad overpriced. Would come back for their lunch special though.  The single Crab Cake was also pricey, but one of the best we've ever tasted. The top value was definitely the Surf and Turf dinner, consisting of two Maine Lobster Tails and a Petite Filet for $55. We like this dish here even better than the one at Maestro's Newport Coast!  The Lobster was tender and the Filet gave Del Frisco a run for the money.  Service was old school and elegant.  We felt like the servers were part of the Miami Mafia, but in a good way!  Will definitely return next time in Vegas.",

It needed to be close to the Bellagio since we had to catch a show and I wanted fish, so we settled on Joe's.   There are all sorts of flashy restaurants in Vegas, but what's nice about Joe's is it's classy. It's a classy fish and steak house with great service and food. I had the parmesan halibut and my husband a steak with a shared side of broccolini. I could tell the fish was fresh. The parm was a little overpowering, but I scrapped a bit of it off and it was still quite good. And the steak was melt in your mouth.   Did I mention the service? It was great. We had told them it was our anniversary the day before and they treated us to free champagne. Then the waiter and other staff congratulated us. And the server was always there just when we needed him - not to much, not to little.   We topped it off with delicious pie. Both the pumpkin and key lime were heavenly. We couldn't decide so they gave us a half slice each - perfect!",

I'd been promising to take my wife to get stone crab claws since we got married but we hadn't yet gotten to South Florida yet.  This was a fine substitute.  Both my wife and our daughter loved their first experience with stone crab.  The shrimp cocktail was also very good if pricey for four admittedly large shrimp.  Pass on the cocktail and get the shrimp de jonghe instead--it was excellent.  The sides were also very good especially the mashed potatoes and four cheese mac and cheese.  But be warned, they are all a la carte and run about 10 bucks each.  Enough to share though.  Sadly, the skirt steak prevents a 5 star review.  Underseasoned and just not up to the standards set by the rest of the meal. If course, that was mine and I recognize my mistake.  Skip the turf, stick with the surf and you should really enjoy Joe's. Bring your wallet, it ain't cheap but not out of line for the venue and the menu.  Finally, do not skip dessert.  We shared the banana creme pie with fosters sauce and it was outstanding(but there were a whole host of other choices we wish we could have tried).",

Dinner was mediocre, the food didn't taste very good to me. I'm gluten free and had a lot of problems with the chef and the gluten free cookie they have. I'm pretty sure there was cross contamination because today I'm feeling side effects from eating gluten. It's probably a good restaurant on a day where they aren't super busy but our service was awful. I suggested this place because of the reviews and I was sorely disappointed.",

The ceviche was good but a little too spicy for my wife. The fried oysters were excellent. The crab was amazing as it always is at Joe's. The service was very good and it was a great place to sit, eat and relax right after a 5.5 hour flight.",

Food is unbelievable.  Crab claws to side veggies to dessert.  We have had the following: stuffed mushrooms, calamari, oysters on the half shell, stone crab, Chilean sea bass, Alaskan king crab, steak, filet mignon, mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, sauteed broccoli, and of course - have tried every dessert.  This place is fancy.  I  hate when tourists (even slacky locals) show up is shorts.  You are getting upscale service and food - so dress the part.  All the seafood here is fresh and delicious.  It is PRICEY and so worth it.  We dine here for special occasions and never regret the amount of the bill.  (Save up for a night out here!) Drinks are spot on.  Great pours - you get your money's worth.  I have to say Joe's is our FAVORITE seafood place here in Vegas.  From service, food, location - so easy to valet park and walk a few feet and you are there - it is fantastic.",

We went in and asked them nicely if they have anything available sooner than 8:30pm.  And that guy responded in a very bad attitude and say no.  So I repeated to ask again and say that is there any chance?  And he suggested \"YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO COME\"   What kind of service is that?  And what kind of attitude is that.    After we walked around and my husband suggested to go ask another guy and pretend it's walk-in and they seat us right away.  So no tables for people who made reservation and tables for people right away??? I really don't understand....   But the food is very good tho, that's why even after the bad attitude we still ate there",

You're bound to get a delicious meal...sure beats losing all your winnings...again.   I was part of a party of 7.  We started our meal with the sauteed garlic spinach, sauteed broccolini, and green beans amandine.  The portions were large enough that everyone had at least a few bites of each.  They were all excellent, perfectly seasoned and cooked right. Even the spinach didn't taste like mush.   Next, we had the Madagascar shrimp, which was THE best I've had...period.  The shrimp was HUGE and very tasty.  It had the smell of being fresh off the grill.  Finally, came the stone crabs...one of their signature items.  Now, I know the place is known for their stone crabs, but I still think the shrimp was better. Anyway, we had a huge order of it, so we all dug in. Now, since most of the others weren't big eaters (more for me), I was able to pig out.  I'm proud to say that I think I must've eaten a dozen or so of them.  To sum up, although this restaurant is on the expensive side, and may break your bank account, I do recommend trying it once.  It's well worth taking a second mortgage.",

Our waiter (Neal) was super knowledgeable, pleasant and endearing. Made great recommendations and as he walked away the next staffer was already placing bread and drinks on the table.   The food was delivered quickly and this was arguably one of the best prepared steaks I have ever had. This review could have gone in another whole direction because my wife's barbecue brushed salmon had bristles that came of the brush that stuck to the top of her fish. I called our waiter over. He apologized, walked ever so briskly into the kitchen and resolved the whole issue quickly and with the most sincere apology. He even assured us that he went right to the chef and had all of the brushes removed and replaced with new ones.   The salmon was replaced, my wife said it also was prepared perfectly, and without my asking, the restaurant removed her meal from the bill and also offered her a free desert.   I highly recommend the restaurant for its exceptional food, outstanding service and ability to make everything right quickly and with no fuss. I have become a lifetime fan.",

    "text": "Pretty much all I can say is WOW. This place blew us away with only a couple of small things I wish could have been different.   When I finally narrowed down where we would be going for my Birthday dinner, I easily made a reservation via OpenTable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other Yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my Birthday.   We took a cab to Caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the Forum Shoppes to the restaurant. We were escorted to the Host Desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. Everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly.   Our waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. I ordered a Cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. The bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. Our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. We started with a medium order of  the Stone Crabs (less sweet than Dungeness but more meaty and tender). It came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but I asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). The cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. It was something I had never seen before and quite memorable.  We shared a chopped salad which was kindly split in the kitchen. It was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. For our mains, the Husband opted for the Beef Wellington (as rare as possible) and I ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. For sides to share, we opted for the GreenBeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of AuGratin Potatoes. My steak was beautiful. It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye I have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and I have had many). The Wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. The only \"miss\" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.  I had been looking forward to the key lime pie I had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, I was a bit disappointed. I am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (I consider milk See's the fancy kind I like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. When our waiter came by, I inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if I wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). I was glad I spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal.   Winner Winner Birthday Dinner and seriously look forward to coming back here someday.      .",

The stone crab is what they're known for and I was anxious to try it! We were seated at a quaint little high top table in the front bar area. Our server was quick and attentive, and she had some excellent advise on navigating their wine menu to pair with our meals. We started with an order of the oysters rockafeller - super tasty and savory! We both ordered steaks for our entrees and some of the stone crab to share between us. My steak was tender and cooked to perfection. Personally, I was not a big fan of the stone crab - I didn't like the flavor much, but figured it was worth trying it out! Overall we had a lovely experience, and it wasn't super crowded. It is very pricey -- part of why we opted for lunch instead of dinner, but even with that, it's gonna take a toll on your pocketbook. I don't see how a two-top gets out of here with a bill under $100.",

As per the book, the wait staff at the original Joe's in Florida are meticulous at details and the food is outstanding. Unfortunately, when I made it to Joe's in Las Vegas, it was late and having just attended a cocktail party, I was not very hungry. My boss and I were seated at a table in the bar area, which I am guessing is a bit less formal than the dining room. Most of the servers were formally dressed and meticulous at details. While I would have liked to have tried everything on the menu, I had the petite filet mignon and a side of crispy brussels sprouts. The filet was cooked to perfection and so tender it was like eating butter. The brussels sprouts were outstanding. They were flash fried and drizzled with a prune vinegar reduction. My boss had the crab bisque, which was rich and flavorful. The bread basket was full of a variety of bread and rolls, which I'm sure were all very tasty and I regret not having tried them all. I loved the charming ambience of an old school steak house at Joe's. I don't give many five stars, but I believe Joe's truly deserves them.",

    "text": "We were here twice in a 24-hour period and were extremely impressed both times. The hosts seated us very quickly, our waitress/waiter were attentive, took our drink order, and answered any questions that we may have had. The first time I ordered the filet and lobster tail with a loaded baked potato as my main course. To start we had fried oysters. The oysters were a bit heavy on the breading, but my main course was super yummy. The waitress the first night was lovely and had suggest we try the crisp Brussels sprouts as another side to share. She was right on; they were absolutely delicious. The second time we went we had a waiter that was very pleasant too. He even shared with me about an app called lettuce eat that tracks how much you spend at the different locations and you received rewards. Bummer the first waitress never shared that with us as it was my birthday, and I would have received extra cash towards dinner. The second part to that is that we easily spent over $150 each time we ate at Joe's which would have given me extra rewards. Either way, the food and service was great. Luckily we were told that there is a Joe's in our area, so I will have to check it out.",

    "text": "I LOVE Joe's. I was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. The service and food are both wonderful. Obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the Las Vegas Strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).  Our charming server (\"Steven\" or \"Stephen\", he-of-the-Awesome-Bulgarian-Accent) suggested we start off with the Shrimp de Jonghe appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. Delicious. Joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend LOVED).   We both ordered surf 'n turf: petit filet mignon (I chose the Alaskan King crab and my friend had lobster). We also split an order of the Hashed Brown potato and the grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce. My steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. However, the crab legs were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so I flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.  The presentation and texture of the Hashed Brown was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). But the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and I don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato Romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). The generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.  We finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). They were both about as good as dessert can get.  To reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). Service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.",

Water and a mixed bread basket were provided immediately. Hubby opted for a lunch 2 course of 6 oz filet, roasted tomato, Jennies potatoes and banana cream pie. I ordered fried chicken, a side of creamed spinach and key lime pie. Our total bill with tip was $86. The food was delicious and the staff attentive.   My only knock was against the maitre d staff. The first guy loved hanging out at a particular table out of sight of the host stand. This left people just standing and wondering what to do (us included). Shift change and Mr \"Handsy\" takes over. This guy could not keep his hands off a coworker - the massage and pressings against her gave me the willies. From our view sexual harassment was alive and well with this guy. No matter what, it was not appropriate behavior at a restaurant.",

I had \"the whale\" appetizer and the two-course lunch, which is a very good deal for people like me who would like to try little of everything. The Alaskan king crab leg in the whale appetizer was very enjoyable, but the rest of the seafood was just ay-okay. The filet mignon in my two-course dinner was cooked nicely but the quality of meat was just not melt-in-your-mouth kind of quality. Jennie's mashed potatoes and banana foster pie were both very good, but nothing to dream about. Overall a very good restaurant for the price.",

A Miami landmark for over 80 years, it has been owned by the same family all this time. I was pleased and suprised to see one had been opened in Las Vegas. I suspect that the famed \"Lettuce Entertain You\" group out of Chicago is responsible for opening this one in Las Vegas as well as, the one that is now open in Chicago. What a perfect match!         I had a 24 ounce Australian Lobster tail that was magnificent!  My wife had a petite Filet with stone crabs. The crabs were sweet and the mustard sauce was the same as in the Miami restaurant. Her steak was cooked to perfection. the potatoes Lionaisse and the creamed spinach with roasted garlic were as good as the Miami store. Service was impeccable and without the need to tip the Captain's $5 a head to get a table (Joe's in Miami is infamous for this). The place actually takes reservations, how civilized. The wine list was very good and fairly priced for an upscale restaurant. Treat yourself to this welcome addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene.",

    "text": "The BEST STEAK and STONE CRABS I have EVER had!!!  The 21 ounce signature bone in rib eye was absolutely AMAZING...  the tenderness...  the succulence...  this is True bliss in steak heaven.  The stone crabs were meaty and mouth-watering.  They crack the shells so you don't have to struggle with it.  In fact, you just peel the shells away from the meat and enjoy.  And for dessert, their signature key lime pie is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I was in the Key West 2 weeks ago and had the opportunity to sample some of Key West's top key lime pie locations and it's interesting to say that Joes Seafood (in Las Vegas) was better.  Wow... Now that's impressive!",

I recall ordering some kind of liver w/ bacon and onions recommended by one of my co-workers.  Looking at the menu I believe it was the \"Calf's liver.\"  My co-worker was right on the button because it really was great.  I tried a little bit of everything else, from the macaroni & cheese to the awesome crab legs.  I can see why people like this place a lot.  It was the first time for me and I didn't get to fully enjoy it since I was drunk off my ass, but I know all my co-workers did!  One thing I can talk about is the service.  Our party was there close to an hour after closing time and the waiters never said 1 thing to us.  They were there to serve and assist us w/ anything we needed and it was totally appreciated by my group.  A+",

    "text": "I don't do much dining at high end steakhouses but a buddy of mine was in town about 6 weeks ago and insisted we go to Joe's so we did.   I got the Filet and Lobster-tail, Hash Brown Potatoes, Crispy Brussels Sprouts. He then introduced me to the best dessert I've ever had- the Havana Dream Pie. We also got Key Lime Pie and Boston Cream Pie. One thing they don't tell you on the menu is that you can get half slices of the pie. And the desserts are very reasonably priced at $4.50 per half slice. Everything we had was amazing with the exception of the filet that didn't really impress me. The hash brown potatoes, crispy Brussels sprouts, and Havana Dream Pie are all to die for!  With my parents in town this week, i decided to go again and also bring the wife along.   For the appetizer we went with the calamari. In all honesty, the best I've ever had. The bread they bring out before the meal is exceptional. I'm not positive but it must be baked in house. SO fresh. My favorites are the regular roll, the pretzel roll, and the cornbread. You will not be disappointed!   This time for the entree, I decided to go with the bone-in ribeye. It was definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had. Highly recommend it! My wife got the skirt steak which she really loved and I had a piece of it and can concur that it was also very good. My parents also went with the ribeye but without the bone. Again, we got the hash brown potatoes and crispy brussels sprouts which were awesome.  Havana Dream and Banana Cream again for desert. Half slices again, which are plenty. I can't even believe full slices are an option as big as the halves are.   The service is grade A, as you expect at this type of establishment.   Hands down, my favorite steakhouse right now and I highly recommend you go if you're looking for a great dining experience in Vegas.",

It was juicy and really easy to eat. The crab cakes were flaky and had huge chunks of crab, unlike the ones from other places where it's dense and full of stuffing. The seafood pasta had lots of shrimp and lobster. The pasta itself was a little mushy and clumpy though, and the flavour was just average. It is also quite expensive, but the food is worth it.",

Maybe the staff feels that the \"show\" is all about them and have the feeling that you should be honored to be dining in their restaurant.  About the food...Caesar salad was mediocre, stone crabs are way overpriced for what you receive.  Mac and cheese an abomination and after we each tried a bite were left on the table.  My filet mignon was tender, but unremarkable.  My sons bone-in rib eye was very good, but at the end of the evening when the best thing anyone commented on was the pretzel bread that was brought at the start of our meal you know this was a waste of money and time.  Well,...Vegas, this time we crapped out.",

We stayed at the Cosmo but found this place on yelp and wow... this was hands down one of my best dining experiences yet! The food was nothing less than excellent and so was the service.  I started with a Martini and I never knew I could get asked so many questions on how I wanted it! The server was so kind and he really took care of us. We're a young couple who love fine dining and still learning the real fancy sh!t on menus... but the server was nothing but patient and thoroughly explained any question about the menu that we had. My fiance got a glass of wine which he said was the best wine he's ever tried in his life which may or may not be an overstatement since he doesn't drink wine...(but I guess it's the best)! We started with the jumbo shrimp cocktail, it only came with four and it was about $20 but man, I savored every bite! For the main, I ordered the 8oz filet with a side of mashed potatoes and he got the Oscar filet which also came with crab. Let me tell you, the steak was easily THE BEST - MOST JUICIEST - MOST SUCCULENT AND FLAVORFUL  steak i've ever had & I have went to a lot of steakhouses! The mashed potatoes were a great side piece that complimented the steak. I was halfway through before I felt like one of those fat Englishmen back in the day with a full big belly who just ate like a King. But in this case a Queen.   After we finished our meals, I knew I had no room for dessert. The server said just take a look at the dessert menu and to let him know if I change my mind. I told him I knew I wouldn't but would still look.... that is until he came out with the Havana Dream Pie he was serving the the family next to us. My fiance and I looked right at the pie and right back at each other and we gave each other that look that said \"that looks good, let's invite it over and  have a three-sum\"... and that's exactly what we did. We ordered the pie and we nearly were orgasming with every bite. It was a tres leches inspired kind of cake pie with a custardy middle and wow... i'm drooling as i'm typing this.   Overall experience was amazing! The server was fantastic and I would come back just for the damn server who was treating us like we were royalty! Not only did he recommend us dishes on the menu, he even gave us some spots to check around the strip that he loves! It felt genuine, like we just became family! We spent about $180 and I would of spent double easily just for the experience. 10/10",

    "text": "I was not going to review this restaurant...however, I HAVE to. SORELY DISAPPOINTING. My husband and I had stone crab claws at Club 33 (we were guests) in Disneyland a few times. They have a large seafood cart with plenty of fresh shellfish on ice. The stone crabs were beautiful, cut around the edge so that one could dip it in the butter and bite into that juicy sweet meat. We excitedly ordered JOE'S version...we ordered the next one up from small, so I guess medium. They came out in a pile on a plate. The shells were broken into bits all over the place. You literally had to clean each piece before you bit into it. The taste was marginal. It wasn't crap, but it was not at all what I expected. It wasn't the freshest seafood I've had and at the prices they charge (over 65.00 for the stone crab alone) it should be top notch. It wasn't. On the other hand, the steak was delish. I have had the same cut at different places that was as good or better. The rest of the food was fine. The waiter was great. Can't remember his name...BIG guy. He noticed my disappointment and went to the manager. He came back and told us that the stone crab is cooked in Florida and flown out here and that is how it arrived. I was so astonished that I repeated what he said and he assured me that s what they do. Hmmmm.  I've never heard such BS in my life. The manager wanted to do something but I guess he wanted me to tell him what to do. I said I didn't complain to get something. I just wanted them to be aware that what they were serving was SUB-PAR. They ended up doing nothing. The manager or whatever he is called didn't even come out to talk to us. Just sent the waiter. Sheesh. Eat at Joe's! Just beware...don't get their \"famous\" stone crab...BLECH.",

I lived in Miami many years ago and often dreamt of having Stone Crabs once again.  When I saw they had a Joe's location in Vegas I just had to dine there.   We ordered martinis which our waitress offered blue cheese stuffed olives or with pimento.  We asked for both.  She brought the martinis with extra olives on the side, the dinner was starting off perfectly.  We began with Stone Crabs, meaty claws served with a tasty mustard sauce.  Just as delicious as I remembered.    We had inquired about the crab bisque, our waitress suggested splitting it because it is a very rich soup.  I would of never thought of sharing, it was a great suggestion.  And the bisque was to die for!  Next came our entree, we both ordered the grilled seafood platter.  Such a large serving of delectable grilled lobster tail, scallops and prawns. We had steamed asparagus as a side.   There was so much seafood we could have shared an entree, neither of us could finish our plates.  Such a shame because it was so good!  You can't leave Joe's without having key lime pie for dessert.  We had a slice to share.  Not overly sweet, light and slightly tart.  Again, just as delicious as I remembered.  All in all a perfect dinner with a lovely server who made it a spot on experience.",

For entries we had steak - I had the New York and my friend had the filet and lobster- steaks were prime and cooked perfectly.    It all made for a wonderful evening.

He helped us pick want we wanted to have for dinner. I had the 22 oz lobster tail and my wife had the halibut which was a T-bone halibut. I also had the Manhattan clam chowder and we also shared the apple pie. The food , the service was 5 stars all the way. In the past we came with my company for dinner for many years but this night was totally special!! I would recommend Joe's all the way!! I will be definitely be coming back!!",

    "text": "The only reason this place is getting three stars, instead of 4 is because of the experience my girlfriend and I had.  I took her here because it's her favorite fine dining spot in town, and as far as food goes, I can see why.  I wouldn't have noticed the service too much, as I was super hungry, but my girlfriend pointed it out.  First, I wrote that it was kind of our anniversary on my open table reservation.  Then, she pointed out how our server took forever to come and check on our meal (I was missing butter). And how her iced tea was never refilled.  The thing I was most upset about is, my credit card was forgotten and I spent the rest of the night without one. Because of the time, I went straight to bed and freaked out when morning came.  I had to go out of my way to retrieve the card.  Thank goodness it wasn't lost, but I wish it was just given back to me with the check.  Other than that.  The food was great",

    "text": "Amazing place to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, or any occasion. Located inside the forum shops right next Starbucks. When you enter forum shops you make a right and just go all the way down.  Celebrated the beau and I 7 years anniversary on Jan 1st and made reservations. It wasn't too busy so if we didn't make reservations I'm pretty sure we would have gotten in quickly. They have a bar area and a fine dining seating. It was a very secluded area, kind of romantic, very elegant.  Upon seating we got a basket of breads, crackers, corn bread and butter. We were noticed right away by waiters and waitresses. They explained the menu in detail and even helped us choose what would be better for us.   For appetizer we got The Whale which comes with Alaskian King crabs, shrimp, lobster tail and scallop shrimp ceviche. It is ordered by how many people is in your party. So the order was for two of us so it was about $24/person. This was really already a good amount of seafood but you know we weren't going to stop there.  We both ordered petite filet mignon which was 8 oz. That was like perfect size maybe even a an oz. too much for me and we also ordered a 1 pound of alaskian king crab which was A LOT! We didn't realize that it would be that much for just the two of us. The crab was so perfect though. It is already cracked open for you and it is sooooo meaty. So much crab in each bite. The steaks were cooked to perfection of course. Very well seasoned.   This is a great place to celebrate an anniversary.",

    "text": "De-Licious! My hubby and I were in town for our anniversary, and wanted to try something new. So after reviewing Yelp the whole ride there, we finally decided on Joe's and made our reservation. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome and were seated immediately. Our waiter brought us waters as we browsed the drink menu along with a bread basket with a variety of breads and OMG the pretzel bread and corn bread was ahhhmazing. I decided to get a Moscow Mule, while hubby decided on a beer, both were refreshing. We picked the shrimp and scallop ceviche for appetizer, and seriously it was so damn good. We typically drench our ceviche in hot sauce, but it wasn't needed as the flavor was amazing and had a little kick to it. The chips you could tell were homemade with a lite dust of chile powder on them.... bomb!!!! For our main course I went with filet mignon which was served with mashed potatoes and a fried basil and cheese tomato. Hubby got the crab stuffed shrimp and we also got roasted corn and Mac and Cheese on the side. My shrimp was delicious as was hubby's shrimp. The corn was seriously so tasty and the other sides were pretty decent. The Mac and Cheese was good, but I'm a huge Mac and Cheese fan and I have to admit I've had better. For dessert we had the Havana Pie and it was literally heaven. It was lite, but yet very scrumptious and the whip cream was served on the side with a lite dust of cinnamon which was super yummyyyy! Over all the service was great, our waiter kept checking on us and wiped the crumbs off of our table each time it was dirty (the bread basket could get a little messy). The food and dessert was superb. We will definitely be dining here again next time we are in town. We might get two orders of the ceviche next time. Yum!!!!",

    "text": "YUMMMM!!!  Has to be the best seafood place on the strip! Both because of the food and the service, our waitress leanne (sp?) was amazing!!! She provided so much interesting history about the restaurant since it has been around for awhile, also made recommendations and told us even not to order certain things because she knows her stuff and she was being honest.  Can I also just say the bread basket was amazing, I could've ate that all night. I seriously love bread and butter so much, the one with the roasted onions and cheese on it was my FAV!  Ordered a dozen oysters of course, which included some kumamoto and fanny bay, delish and super fresh (5 stars)  Also ordered some crab legs and they were the best I've ever tasted, so incredibly fresh, she told us they come straight to the restaurant unlike some other places where they first need to preserve them with a bunch of chemicals. That was awesome. (5 stars)  Stone crab claw (2 stars)- Our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and I def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with the Miso Glaze (4.5 stars)- DIVINE. The flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. My brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. It wasn't chewy or anything so I ate it, but I do like my fish almost medium.   Dover Sole (4 stars)- My dad and brother got this, they served this table side, I enjoyed the sea bass more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)  Sides:  Roasted Corn (2 stars)- This is one thing I didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. My brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish I had that!  Mashed potatoes (4 stars)- Good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)  Dessert- it was all pies! I'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and I think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)  Word of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so DO NOT valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. Wish we knew that ahead of time!",

    "text": "Really disappointed with Joe's. Live in California and visit Vegas about once a year. Have made it a little tradition to stop by Joe's Seafood whenever possible. Each time we come here, we splurge. The last time we got to eat here, came with a party of 8, got a back room and went to town on steaks, crab, oysters, wine, the works. Didn't mind spending the money due to excellent service and food. This past visit, I arrived with my wife and 1 year old around 1:30pm. An older man greeted us at the entrance and asked how many in our party. I replied 2 adults and a baby. He said it would be at least an hour but that we could have been seated immediately in the bar area if the baby wasn't with us. I thought the comment odd and I could see that there were at least 3 open tables behind him, but didn't think much of it and gave him my name. We walk around the mall for a bit and my wife wondered if the guy thought we needed a table for four. Our baby is not found of high chairs so my wife usually sits him in her lap. We go back to Joe's and I ask the man if it would make any difference if it was only a table for two. He says it would not make a difference but sees me glancing behind him at the empty tables. He then tells me that we would need extra room for our stroller and the reiterates that if we didn't have our baby, we could sit at the bar. This makes absolutely no sense to me as I know that Joe's has room in the back for coat checks and our stroller folds up... and more than that, you want us to get rid of our baby to eat at your restaurant?   At this point I could have made a scene, talked to the manager, yada yada yada. But did I want to fight with an old timer about spending several hundred dollars on lunch? (yeah, we go all out when we come here). I was about to thank the man but he was already looking past me to the next group of people. So my wife and I go upstairs to eat at sushi roku, which was surprisingly good and they were super friendly. The kicker is that after we ate, we went downstairs and passed by Joe's. The same tables were empty.   The way he was talking to me I could chalk it up to a lot of things, racism (I'm not white), the way I was dressed (shorts and tshirt since we were on our way to the airport) or a couple with a really young kid (not appropriate for this venue). Bottom line is that he wasn't talking to me like a person but talking at me like an obstacle.   Wouldn't be writing this but to say that Joe's has lost a customer for life. Go to conventions here every other year and our vendors give us a choice of restaurants. Used to recommend Joe's, but not anymore. Their food is good, sometimes even great on their on days, but part of the whole experience is the service. You can get good seafood and good food at plenty of places in Vegas. Number 1 rule is that you treat your customers with respect. I didn't get that here, and for me, that is enough to say never again.   For a \"classy\" place, they showed zero class. What a disappointment.",

I'll just comment on what I ate.  1)Appetizer: Crabcake- $16.00, not very large, split it two ways and it was delicious. 2) Entree: Lobster stuffed in Sole (fish) with assorted sauces. This was very very tasty and while i'm not a huge seafood fan this was one of my more memorable fish eating experiences. 3) Desert: Compliments of the house a brownie slice topped with ice cream and whipped creme for her birthday.. well use your imagination on how it tasted.  Highly recommended and apparently the stone crabs are top notch.",

If you have never had Stone Crab claws then you need to try them here. They are sweet, fresh, delectable, actually decadent.  As for dinner - make sure you come hungery. The Caesar salads were great. We ordered the 24 oz.  bone in rib eye, 8oz. Filet, 12oz. filet, and the NY strip with a loaded baked potato, steamed asparagus, mac and cheese, and creamed spinach. Everything was cooked perfectly.

I had the amazing Bloody Mary while my husband had a Stella. Everything came in a timely manner...my Bloody Mary had a gigantic shrimp in it which was fantastic. The waitress then took our order and was very helpful in explaining the menu items and seasonal pricing. My hubby decided on the Fishermans Platter (he chose grilled, you can also get fried) while I had to have the signature crab claws. We both also ordered the side ceasar salad and a cup of lobster bisque.  The ceasar salad was good. Not amazing or anything but a well put together well dressed salad. Now, the lobster bisque was EPIC. Velvety and creamy...my hubby and I were licking our spoons and wanting more. I definitely recommend the lobster bisque to anyone (besides those with shellfish allergies of course). The main courses then came out and they were nicely presented, just simple seafood and simple condiments. My husbands seafood platter was fresh, light, and delicious. The stand out star being the scallops which were super sweet and grilled perfectly. My crab claws we're delicious...definitely a bit of work to get to the meat but well worth it. I wasn't a big fan of their mustard sauce they serve with the claws, so I requested lemons and clarified butter. No issues. All in all in was a delightful lunch that I would definitely do again.",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here to celebrate my 30th birthday and we were more than impressed. Very elegant, yet laid back and light atmosphere. The service was top notch. And they did a great job of explaining the menu and really made us feel comfortable. Drinks were excellent. My husband had an old fashioned and I had a dirty martini and they were both very good. The stone crab is a must try! The mustard sauce it comes with is to die for. We had this as an appetizer to share but it could also be an entree for one. My husband had the filet and lobster tail as an entree and it was outstanding. We're from Nebraska so we're pretty snobby when it comes to beef, and the filet did not disappoint! I had the Chilean sea bass and it was out of this world. One of the best meals I've had. We shared a side dish of roasted cauliflower that was quite delicious as well. They also gave us a free birthday dessert of a brownie a la mode. Only took one bite as I was extremely full, but it was very good. If you're in Vegas and want an elegant delicious meal this is definitely the place! And I have to say the pricing wasn't terrible. It's obviously more pricey than some places but for what you get it was definitely well worth it! I can't recommend Joe's enough!",

My husband loves the Dover sole and the Filet Mignon.  My favorite is the Whaler appetizer and the Grilled Seafood Platter.   We often sit at the bar because Bob the bartender is the best! He gives us exceptional service and is so nice to talk to.  Also, the manager Kyle will come by to make sure you are having a great dining experience.   Joe's knows how to treat their customers and that is why we are regulars!!!",

    "text": "Wow!  I simply can not say enough good about his place and frankly, I am not easy to please!  Our server Leeann was the absolute best and happily assisted my husband, since I abdicated complete menu selection to him. (There were simply too many good choices and I was not up to decision making!).   She was so very friendly and helpful that I knew we would have fun, but the whole evening was one of the nicest nights out we have ever had. Eddie who was assisting Leeann was also personable and it seems like he company treats staff well, since many of them have been there for years. The diamond studded crab on Eddie's jacket marked ten years of great service. We even asked to speak to the general manager, Danny who was also very pleasant and took time to listen to our rave reviews.  Hats of to this place for excellent staff!  Now, about the food...DELICIOUS.  Started with a prosciutto and melon appetizer. It was a variety of four melons, my favorite of which was the Santa Claus melon, with thinly sliced prosciutto. There were also a variety of olives (no pits!) drizzled with some EVOO and red pepper flakes.  Next came the Stone Crab and Kings Crab plates.  Ungodly good. I loved that they were perfectly prepared but the way they serve them means you can still be dressed up and not have to worry about making a mess.   The crab was sweet and delicious.  Final dish was a New York strip served with a side of fried green tomatoes. Although I was close to full, the fact that we shared everything made it okay to have some of each.  Steak came out perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rare and was seasoned just right. Fried tomatoes were awesome and barely needed a dip in the dressing.   A last surprise was a birthday treat, a warm gluten free brownie topped with vanilla ice cream. Leeann told me it was mandatory that you have at least a bite for birthday luck, so I had to taste it for her.  Never had anything gluten free taste that good.  If you are in Vegas, I highly recommend this place. Even though I would suggest asking for Leann and Eddie, I have a sneaking suspicion that given what I learned about the restaurant, other staff might be okay too!  THANKS Joes!",

The mall has a valet station next to Joes which makes it very convenient and saves you the walk around the whole mall.   We were seated once our whole party was present. While we waited we were able to grab drinks at the bar or take pictures by the fountains.    My family and I were very pleased with our dinner experience at Joe's. We were seated in a private dining room with a table that sits up to 12.  Our servers were very helpful and accommodating.   For starters we got Joe's Chopped salad, which reminded me of a Greek salad with black olives and feta cheese, and the octopus salad.   We got the porterhouse and rib eye steak. They were evenly charred and cooked perfectly to a medium temp. The Alaskan crab legs are a must! They were the biggest and most succulent crab legs I've ever had. I was tempted to order another 1.5 pounds of it.  We also loved the seared scallops, cooked perfectly!  For sides we got Jennie's potatoes and asparagus (which they peel). Both good!  The grand finale was their key lime pie! Cold, tangy, creamy... deliciousness!",

    "text": "I have seen those tantalizing billboards for Joe's off the highway towards the Strip for years.  Big mounds of succulent-looking stone crabs piled high in a tin cistern.  Prime rib with Butter.  But, I was not going to let myself be tempted enough to go.  Why? The name! Come on, how could I justify spending valuable time and money (especially as a local) on the Las Vegas Strip at a place that calls itself, \"Joe's\"? It just sounds to me like the kind of place where you would go in the summer in jeans, and wear a lobster bib over your Hawaiian shirt, surrounded by portable water misters and fake palm trees, and teenagers emerge during designated times wearing Khaki shorts to form a conga line on top of a dance floor composed of faux sand, to the dulcet sounds of \"If you like Pina Coladas...\"  Yes, I saw it that vividly.  It is probably an unfortunate transference from \"Joe's Crab Shack\" that I used to frequent with my mother.  Which is not a bad thing.  (In fact, I have fond memories of it).  But I wasn't about to spend hundreds of dollars on such an experience...  But then a co-worker who had been invited by an ex-boyfriend (already suspicious), came back beaming about Joe's, and so I researched and saw that the Yelp reviews looked good! So, when my sister's bday came 'round, I took the leap. I like seafood and she likes steak.  And I could finally tell from the photos online that we would not have to wear overalls to dinner, or get up and dance under a limbo stick before dessert.  Bet!  I was delighted to find that Joe's has its own valet, separate from the rest of Caesar's and the Forum shops.  Fancy! And convenient.  The service here is surprisingly good.  It's a little weird that your waiter wears a full tuxedo.  It's like you got caught in some black-tie Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Talk about camp! But it plays.  The service is super \"high class,\" even as the actual restaurant itself is only a step and a half above nice casual.  There are nice white tablecloths and real silverware (and no lobster bibs!).  But it still feels like a nicer chain restaurant in a fancy mall.  And there's nothing wrong with that.    Sis ordered the Dover sole.  This is a signature dish of the restaurant.  What a triumph! It was amazing.  The freshness, the flavor, the fabulous production of de-boning it table side...  I would have been happy eating the skin and bones discarded by the masterful fillet-er.  It was that good.  The stone crabs we ordered were on the larger side, so they actually had meat on their \"bones.\"  Delicious.  The oysters were so fresh it was like they came screaming out of the water.  We got a kick out of the little tiny bottle of Tabasco it came with.  The petite steak was good and fine.  Nothing write home-worthy, but no slouch, either.  I think I would go for a larger steak next time, like the prime rib.  The creamed spinach was tender and tangy.  And the mashed potatoes held up to scrutiny.  (The technicolor mac and cheese is not a star.  She should remain backstage.  Don't be tempted to order it.  You will thank me later).  The bread offered was good enough to Kiss your Keto goodbye for.  And the dessert--which was offered complimentary due to celebrating our birthdays--was key lime pie (excellent) and a chocolate thingy with ice cream (also, excellent).  I enjoyed learning that Joe's started in Miami Beach.  Being in the front \"patio\" of the mall, near one of the indoor fountains at Forum Shop, you can almost feel yourself hearkening back to that time in 1913 when \"Joe\" Weiss started this franchise on the water.  And having eaten there, I know why it is one of the most beloved and widely recognized restaurants in the world, over 100 years later.  No conga line about it.",

Although it was not stone crab season, we still ordered them and they were really good! We also ordered a caesar salad to start and it was good. Make sure to ask for extra dressing though because it comes mostly dry without any. My mother in law is really picky about her crab cake because she refuses to have one with too much filler so the waiter told her not to worry and order it. When it came out, she was pleasantly surprised that it was mostly crab in the cake and hardly any filler. YAY. The fish and chips were delicious! Fried perfectly and not too much batter. The waiter recommended I try the chicken caprese sandwich and it was also really good. I have a shellfish allergy so I could not eat the garlic fries it came with since everything is fried in the same oil so I opted for the corn side dish which was really good. The corn was a hit with us. My boyfriend really enjoyed the mahi tacos as well.",

The place was packed even though there were a lot of seating.  I've been to the Miami location but when I found out they opened a location in Vegas that accepted reservations, I was all over that.  We ordered 3 orders of the medium stone crab claws, bone in halibut, lyonnaise potatoes side, and creamed spinach side.  The portions were large enough to share.  The stone crabs were fresh and in season.  The food was as delicious as I remembered.  I really liked the halibut and the lyonnaise potatoes as well.  Obviously, the stone crabs with the mustard sauce were the best.  We also ordered the strawberry rhubarb and key lime pie.  The key lime pie was tart and refreshing.  Service was excellent, very attentive and fast.  If I'm ever in Vegas again, I would definitely come back.",

We also has oysters. They were very fresh and buttery. Texture was great and tasted amazing!!!  I ordered the rib eye steak at medium rare. The steak came out perfect! It was soft, tender, and not over cooked. Just the way I like it. They didn't to anything crazy to the steak so you can actually taste the steak and not the seasoning. Overall a very top notch steak. One of the better ones I have tried.  Overall a great dining experience. Everything was what you would expect from a great restaurant. Great service, ambiance, and food.   Would highly recommend for anyone on a date night, hanging out with friends, or just want great food and service!",

It was zing zang mix, which is store bought, but MY fav. Garnished with celery, shrimp, and olive. That shrimp alone was worth $5 or more. HUGE!  We skipped the apps at dinner in favor of more sides. We had the mushrooms gratin, lyonnaise potatoes, and creamed spinach. The mushrooms were awesome with this panko crust that gave them more texture.   I had the NY done to a perfect medium rare. My gal had the AK King Crab roll. The roll had an abundance of flavorful meat. The steak was meaty and trimmed nicely. Cooked to a perfect temp of medium rare (see photo).   I had made mention on the rsvp that it was my wife's birthday. Saying this nets you a free brownie dessert with ice cream.   Vegas has a lot of steakhouses, but in the age of millennial servers, this one provides a superior level of attention and the food is on point.",

    "text": "My last experience here was so exceptional that I decided to bring some colleagues back here with me, particularly to sample the stone crab claws that they are best known for.  We had a variety of dishes but my only disappointment turned out to be the stone crab claws. Our waiter suggested that we get the large portion of stone crab claw as the smaller size claws don't have much meat so we each got a claw and it just wasn't all that satisfying considering each claw costed close to $12/ea and was just cold boiled crab claws. Perhaps my high expectations got the better of me. However, I think everyone thought the entrees were all quite good.   The ahi tuna steak was particularly interesting as it looked like a 2\" thick filet. Also I get to have my favorite key lime pie and it was definitely very satisfying.",

    "text": "The hubs, some friends, and I were looking for a place to grab a bite, Sunday evening. We walked right up and we were seated right away, which we appreciated.     I ordered the Ahi tartare, a Caesar salad, a Sangria, and the halibut special. My food was good. The halibut, a beautiful bone in cut of fish, but the preparation left a bit to be desired. I didn't finish it. It was a simple preparation, pepper & olive oil. It was not the best or worst piece of fish I've had. There was just nothing about it that made me want to finish it.      I also ordered a key lime pie, which was phenomenal. The hubs ordered the Havana dream pie, which was also good, but the key lime was better!      My husband got the steak tartare, a platter of oysters, and a ribeye. He agreed with me that the service and ambience were great, the entree was not the best he's ever had. The steak tartare was very good.      Our friend ordered a filet and seemed to be content.      Again, the ambience is nice, a classy & relaxed atmosphere. The service was outstanding.      The only complaint I do have, is about an hour or so later, I started feeling very ill, stomach cramps and all. My only guess is that someone unintentionally mishandled one of my food items. It was a bit disappointing to have a $400 dinner that made me sick. Again, this seems to be random because I saw no other issues on Yelp, so it was more than likely an unfortunate incident, but I would not return.",

Last night we arrived 30 minutes before our reservation, I highly recommend to make reservations, we both enjoyed a couple cocktails in their bar area before hand. This time I had to try the South Beach Peach Martini... so good! It's a popular drink here and has been recommended by many on their reviews. Side note, It is on the sweeter side so one was enough for me.  We ordered a little bit of everything: calamari lobster bisque soup, Alaskan king crab legs, Jennie's potatoes, creamed spinach, Mac n cheese, and filet mignon. Everything was amazing but this time the filet came out a bit dry but still good.  Love this place! We had a great time and till next time.",

Authentic, rich, and vibrant perfectly describes this place.  While my boyfriend loves steak, I love seafood. I am a bread lover and was wondering over by the  diversity of bread we were served upon being seated. As a Philadelphian i appreciate all things pretzel,  so the pretzel rolls had me drooling from the start. We had the calamari that was fresh and hot. I had the seared scallops. The scallops were juicy & bursting with great seasoning. The creamed spinach and potatoes we had with our meal was superb.

It just feels genuinely nice to walk in and chat it up with the maitre de who creates the experience right off the bat and the rest follow up to knock it out of the park. I guess we frequent here enough over the years for them to recognize us and our waitress who remembers waiting on us many times even thought we were locals. That still is such a rare find nowadays.  Once again I couldn't stray and I ended up getting the grilled seafood platter. For me killing scallops, lobster, and shrimp in one reasonably priced meal sends my wallet into financial euphoria. Above that though everything is always so fresh and cooked to magnificent texture. I always wish though I had just enough room for the banana cream pie with banana foster sauce..OMG!  This truly is what I believe the best seafood on the strip and partnered with amazing service has been what's kept me in the door all these years and for the many more yet to come!",

The lobster tail was so tender dipped into the delicious buttery drawn butter. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked mid-well. Hubby's chicken dish was superb! Perfectly baked and so juicy. We finished everything. I do feel like the price can be slightly cheaper. We'll for sure come back for the lobster tails.",

These are meaty and served cold with a yummy dijonnaise(?) sauce.  Love the sides, this time we got the baked sweet potato and sauteed spinach. Love the Mac and cheese, all potato sides, creamed spinach too!  Yummmmyummmm--will surely be back. Love our waitress that evening of Sunday 4/22. She is from England --had the cutest accent. Sorry couldn't remember her name, we had just flown in so was a bit tired...but please give her credits. Nice suggestions and fun",

We finished our meal with a fudge brownie, warm apple pie, and my favorite banana cream pie. Suzanne always takes care of us, if you're ever there request her as your server, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to visit Joe's for quite a while, and my boyfriend and I finally made a reservation to try their lobster that he had been craving. The place was packed, so I highly recommend that you make a reservation before you go there. We arrived 20 minutes late trying to look for the restaurant within the Forum Shops, but we were still seated promptly.   Service was fast and professional. We were given our drinks and a complimentary bread assortments right away. We ordered Crab Cake, Fillet Mignon 8oz, and Lobster Tail.   The Crab Cake was really good, and it was a nice start to our meal. It was served with a creamy sauce with a little horseradish kick at the end.   The Lobster Tail was exquisite! Our server, Thomas, was nice enough to mention that they have changed the style of how they cook their lobsters so that it is now more tender than it was before.   The Fillet Mignon was good, but a little under seasoned for my liking. It came with a salt based seasoning on the side, but I wasn't a big fan of it and I asked for steak sauce instead. They only had A1 sauce, which was alright with me. Perhaps my opinion of the steak is biased because my last steak I had was real Kobe beef in Japan, which was hands down the best steak I'll ever have lol  Our total was about $140, which I think is reasonable. Overall, I highly recommend Joe's, and I'll definitely be coming back!",

We did not have reservations, but were led to a table immediately upon arriving.  My hubby ordered oysters, .... and he enjoyed his meal. I ordered the crab bisque soup and the filet mignon medium well. My meal was delicious!  Tip you order main courses and sides separately and our amazing waiter (John) said that the sides are large enough to share.   Our friends ordered a salad to share, followed by the fried chicken and fish. I can't remember what kind of fish, but she said it was good.  DESSERT: Yummy! We had a cherry pie with a scoop of ice cream. Our friends did not order a dessert but were surprised with a key lime pie, how sweet is that!!! John made great conversation and learned that we were celebrating the completion of my friend's Masters Degree. I found his attention to detail just perfect. He checked on us regularly, but was not annoying.",

    "text": "I've had Lawry's, Ruth's Chris & Mastro's and this place does not compare to those steakhouses.   My sister & I wanted to eat a nice steak for dinner but since our mom wanted seafood, we settled for Joe's (we were debating between Lawry's & Joe's).   Ordered the tuna tartare, seafood platter, filet mignon, bone-in ribeye, creamed corn & mashed potatoes. The portions were A LOT smaller than anticipated. Definitely incomparable to Lawry's prime rib & sides.   Tuna tartare- 3/5 The appetizer was TINY with mediocre pieces of fish. The cracker? Used for the tartare was a bit like pork rinds without the pork. Was a good combo with the fish but definitely wouldn't order again.   Seafood platter- 4/5 Came with maybe 6 pieces of scallop, 2 shrimp, and 3 lobster tails? This was a lot smaller than was expected as well. The buttery sauce it came with was delicious but nothing spectacular. My mom, however, was satisfied so thus we were as well.   Filet mignon- 2/5 We asked for a medium rare but instead we got more of a medium, which was quite chewy. The steak was seasoned well but some parts were very salty. Definitely wouldn't order again.   Bone-in ribeye 4/5 The best part of the meal. Asked for medium rare plus and got exactly that. It was juicy, flavorful & tender. Since we shared all our plates, this was the first to go.   Mashed potatoes & creamed corn! 4/5  Both tasted very good but again, small portions. The mashed potatoes contained some cheese and was topped with some kind of flakes that were amazing. The creamed corn was just absolutely phenomenal. DEFINITELY WILL ORDER BOTH AGAIN.   Finally, dessert! Key lime pie & banana cream pie. 4/5 Key lime pie was sour but the crust was delish! And the banana cream pie had a lot of cream in it but it was good as well. Had to order it since it's like. Only my favorite dessert ever. Also ordered the coffee (from Intelligentsia!) but it was so watered down & weak. Asked for an espresso instead.   Service 2/5 Our server was not very friendly and was quite slow to tend to our needs. He kept saying he would get back to us but seemed uninterested in serving us.   Probably will never come here again.",

    "text": "Joe's is one of my favorite restaurants ever, so when I got the opportunity to plan a wedding last minute and needed a place for a small wedding reception, I instantly thought of Joe's... plus the idea of a havana dream pie wedding cake was just so delicious, I couldn't resist. Working with the folks at Joe's was super easy and they were able to accommodate so many of my unique requests and last minute changes to the set menu. Jessica and Khaveri were super professional and communicated so well with me. I had some sour experiences with trying to book through Caesar's special events (which Joe's is not apart of), so to work with people who understand quality and customer service was such a blessing during this hectic time.   When it came to the actual reception, our service and food were impeccable. I've had to give up crab due to a shellfish allergy, so I enviously watched as the dinner guests dined on the stone crab. I chose the Chilean Sea Bass as my entree, and myself and the groom (also allergic to shellfish), both commented that it was one of the best takes on the dish that we've ever had. The bride and groom were so impressed at the spread. The bride was admiring the seasoning on her steak, and one of our waiters came out instantly with their packaged seasoning for her to take home. They even emptied and packed up the wine bottles from the dinner for the bride to use as part of a shadowbox for later.   Even if you're not in need of a place to hold a reception, Joe's is great for lunch and dinner. I've dined here many times and have always been treated so well by everyone I've encountered. Most recently I took my in-laws here for my mother-in-law's birthday and our waiter Daniel Z. was so impressive! Not only did he offer up some great recommendations and made sure we made it on time to our 7:30pm show (offering a shortcut to us as well), he made sure to make my mother-in-law feel special on her birthday as well. Thanks Joe's for setting the bar for a Vegas restaurant experience!",

Seafood is the reason to come, but they do have some non-seafood options (chicken, steak) if you are in the mood.  It's like watching an impromptu ballet when the waiters and servers  move through the dining room.  No one bumps into anyone else, no one dropped anything while I was there.  A very old school level of service and courtesy that is often missing in many restaurant.  But I really often come here for their Key Lime Pie.  Tart, sweet, with a great graham cracker crust.

IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! We started off with some cocktails. My mother doesn't enjoy heavy drinks so we asked for something fruity- didn't see anything so they recommended this off the menu. They brought us \"South Beach Peach\" which is a Peach Liquor with a Lavender Salt Rim. It was unique and my Mom loved it as did I. We ordered the Alaskan King Crab it's normally served chilled but we requested it steamed. It was divine. It's been broken apart for you but left in the shell. All you have to do is use your fork to pull the delicious meat right out. We ordered the Grilled Seafood Sample Plater which comes with Lobster Tail, Shrimp and Scallops. Everything was cooked perfectly to taste. Last we ordered the Halibut. This was the only underwhelming order. It was a bit over cooked and bland. Would not reorder again. Waiter brought out a delicious brownie sundae for my Mother's Birthday and it was a really yummy treat that she liked quite a bit. My parents told me \"This is the best Seafood we've ever had.\" I was praised so highly by them that when the bill came I didn't mind paying nearly $300 for the meal including tip. We left relaxed, well fed and well taken care of. We had a Wonderful Asian Gentleman as our waiter and I regret that we didn't remember his name. He was very professional and made the experience that much better by offering recommendations and helping guide our experience. All in all I was VERY impressed.   Two nights later my Mom said she wanted to go back. I was surprised but she really wanted another South Beach Peach Cocktail. So we showed up without a reservation and were immediately seated on their patio. We had a younger waiter, David, and we reordered the same meal without the Halibut and again it was divine. Service was welcoming and we enjoyed twice as many cocktails. This restaurant delivers and if you're looking to treat yourself or loved ones I couldn't recommend it more. Honestly, Superb. Now our favorite Las Vegas Restaurant.",

    "text": "Joe's Seafood & Prime Steak was certainly delicious. This review is a tad different as we didn't order the steak since we each had the Beef Bowl cut at Lawry's the night before. The crab bisque was quite good however I much prefer the lobster bisque at Craft Steak. The texture was smoother at Tom Colicchio's place. The large stone crab claws were actually disappointing. Apparently they cannot deliver the jumbo size to Vegas. It wasn't bad, just nothing special for a price tag of $85 for five claws. The 1.5 pounds of Alaskan King Crab on the other hand was amazing. These are not your buffet crab legs. They were huge, sweet and not watery. Pairing it with drawn butter was perfection. The Tuna Filet Mignon was excellent as well. It came with a bordelaise sauce that was yummy. Also enjoyed the lyonnaise potatoes. Both the Moscow Mule and recommended glass of red wine were very good. We were too full for dessert though I know they are known for the Key Lime pie. Service was impeccable. Total bill for two people was $350 inclusive of tax and tip.",

It is just one of those places that is consistently good and if a place can catch my heart twice, then it is a real winner.   We had 8 of us and made a reservation for 5:30 PM. We lucked out and got a private room in the back and let me just say, it was perfect because we can get pretty loud, I mean there were 8 girls!  Service was above average, which is expected in this type of establishment.   We did family style and found ourselves having to order duplicate sides because we enjoyed them and one dish was not enough for 8 people.   We got two of the ahi tuna tartare, two crab bisque's, some heirloom tomato dish, two orders of the large stone crab which comes with 5 each, two bone in rib eyes, two orders of the Chilean sea bass, steamed asparagus, green beans, mashed potatoes and corn.  Everything, I mean absolutely everything was delicious.  I WILL BE BACK my next round in Vegas!!",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to come here for dinner, so we made sure to make a reservation. It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday evening though. This restaurant was a lot fancier than I had thought, and I felt very under dressed.   Our server wasn't the nicest person...he didn't smile and never made eye contact. However, another employee who always picked up our food and cleared the table was seriously the best! He was so friendly and kind.   We decided to try out the fried oysters. We are both not oyster lovers, so we decided to give it a shot. At first, it was ok, but the larger pieces were so soft and the fried crust was not crispy. It tasted like mush. If you're not a fan of oysters, I'd stay away from this dish.   We, of course, ordered the stone crabs. They were pretty pricey, but delicious! I liked that the crabs were already cracked, so it was pretty easy to eat. There was a ton of meat in each crab. The crab was served with the house mustard sauce, which was ok. I would prefer something spicy - like Tabasco, but I did not ask for that.   Our last course was the rib eye and a side of asparagus. The rib eye was cooked perfectly, and we requested that they cut the meat into slices to make it easier to eat. The side of asparagus was just ok. At first, it was weird because the asparagus was shaved, so it was white. I would have preferred more flavor too.   FYI- soft drinks are not refillable here. The only drinks that are refillable are the lemonade and iced tea.",

All of us ordered something different and enjoyed each dish, sides, & wine pairing. The ambiance was nice and classy (not too noisy, but lively). We got a round table (for 6) and were able to hear each other without trouble.  But I would like to call special attention to our server Linda D., who was not only knowledgeable about the entire menu and offered great suggestions, but her interaction and enthusiasm elevated it from a good meal to great experience.  Seriously - all 6 people dining commented that she was as important as anything on the table.    Needless to say, we will all be back - and specifically ask for Linda D. to be our server (plus, she has a charming British accent, and a wicked sense of humor).",

Lately I've been going all in on the Alaskan King Crab because it's the sweetest tasting crab you'll ever have. We like it so much that we regularly try to get this same crab back home. My favorites here beyond amazing steaks are the pretzel breads with the same mustard sauce they serve with the stone crab claws - do yourself a favor and try it. The wedge salads are delicious and the creamed spinach and corn are top notch. Last night we tried the broccolini and onion strings for the first time which were both great and our waitress clued us in on an off the menu potato dish called the Big Daddy that was a sort of ball of scalloped potatoes deep fried and placed on some sauteed onions and then served with melted cheese, bacon bits, and a dollop of sour cream - sort of a reconstructed and deep fried \"baked\" potato. The whole thing tasted delicious. Thanks again Joe's and probably see you again in a few months.",

The wedge salads are a must order because they were out of control! They finely dice the onion, add blue cheese crumbles, and then their dressing which was almost a French vinaigrette. Best wedge ever!   They have a fun assorted bread basket that comes out first and I always love that since I'm a carb freak.

Several of the employees went above and beyond to ensure it was a great experience for all. The food was great too. We had a pre-fixed menu and the highlight was the king crab from \"The Whale\" appetizer. Would highly recommend that. Unfortunately it wasn't stone crab season when we dined there, but many people in our group ordered the strip steak and loved it. This is a great place for large parties.",

We ordered the medium claws and Madagascar shrimp. Stone crab claws r so delicious! I had Miso Sea Bass, awesome dish and she had filet mignon. Filet was okay. It's more of a Seafood restaurant. Dessert was peppermint ice cream n it was refreshing.  We be back in November for the fresh Alaskan Crab Legs season!",

The maitre d' was friendly and we were seated earlier than our reservation to start. John, our waiter, was eager to tell us everything we needed to know. My husband is not a fan of seafood but John knew what he wanted. He said you want the Ribeye & Big Daddy hash browns,  which were not on the menu,and did not disappoint. He proceeded to tell us all about the crab and even though I was set on a filet and tail he suggested I try the crab and still get the 8oz filet.  Our food hit the table with impressive timing. Everything was cooked to perfection. The Brussel Sprouts are incredible! Do not pass them up.  Dessert was delicious and the perfect amount of sweetness to top off our night. I'm sure in Vegas these type of places are everywhere but we couldn't be happier with our visit. We all walked out feeling like royalty (kings and queens, if you will).",

Lately I have been coming here for lunch, they have an amazing lunch menu, and my favorite is the Chopped Seafood Salad that has shrimp, lobster and Alaskan king crab. The dressing is amazing, not heavy at all. For $16.95 you really can't beat this! Oh and the bread basket, SO GOOD! I love the cracker with everything on it, my friend and I usually fight over it.  For cocktails, if you feel like drinking a days calories in liquid form, you have to try the Key Lime Martini, it has a graham cracker crusted rim and is made with the same ingredients they make the actual key lime pies. It's amazing. My other favorite is the French 75, served in a champagne flute, Bombay Saphire Gin, Prosecco, fresh lemon juice.   Lastly, the famous Key Lime Pie for dessert, if you haven't filled up on the martini's, this is a must!  Make a reservation to sit out in the front area so you can people watch.",

We had reservations at Gordon Ramsey Steak, but we've been disappointed with so many fancy restaurants on the Strip and decided to go with something a little less expensive. I had the 6oz filet, hubby had the filet with lobster tail. Either his filet was much smaller than 6oz or mine was a lot bigger than 6oz, not sure. It averaged out to enough food for both of us, but that seemed odd. I didn't think the food was super good, however to be fair, I rarely think restaurant steaks are as good as what hubby makes at home. Wishing I had tried the sea bass. Our server, John, was awesome tho and gave us a great experience. So glad we chose to move to the \"patio\" and got him. Their key lime pie and Havana Dream Pie are really good! Our bill came out to just under $200 after tip and that included a bourbon, two $9 glasses of wine and one $23 glass. It wasn't worth that much in my opinion, but Vegas dining isn't cheap.",

The crab was delicious and the sauce nicely complimented the dish. As a side i ordered the sweet potato fries.. it was sooo yummy with the mustard sauce.  My beau had the bone in filet. Yes were all a little confused that the filet came with a bone, but our waiter assured us it was possible. It was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth. That's how I like my filet mignon!  Everyone else loved their dishes. At the very end our server brought my parents a lovely brownie topped with ice cream to celebrate their anniversary.  Joe's made us feel very welcome!

    "text": "On September 18, 2012, we chose this restaurant as we strolled through the Caesar's Forum Shops..  The setting is dark and a bit formal.  We were dressed nicely, but not \"dressed up.\"  Starting with a very special bread basket, the experience got better and better.  I had BC Oysters on the halfshell, while my husband had a green salad.  Everything is ala carte, so I ordered a filet, and my husbad had what he describes as \"the best ribeye of his life.\"  We shared the waiter-recommended fried corn, which was yummy and unique.  Although we were stuffed, the waiter then hypnotized us and made us order key lime pie and coconut cream pie for dessert.    Our waiter Keith, was charming and real. so we had a nice conversation with him as well as a great meal.  Joe's is not inexpensive, but a really great meal warrants a return visit.",

    "text": "I so wanted to like this place, as I am a foodie and love steakhouses. The reviews were very good, the restaurant was close and there was a good time available. As I was alone, I was given a small table close to the kitchen, which was understandable. However, I didn't really enjoy the constant parade of waiters brushing my shoulder every time they went by. Service from my waiter was a bit slow and he was indifferent. Whenever I try a new steakhouse, I normally order my favorite, tenderloin Oscar Style. To me this is a perfect way to see if a steakhouse is worth its' salt. With a name like Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab expectations were understandably high. I ordered it medium rare. When it came, it came with crab on top and sauce on the side, it looked like a beautiful piece of meat but was disappointed when I cut into the middle of it and it was RAW, as in the top 1/4\" and bottom 1/4\" were cooked properly but the middle 1\" looked blue. When I told my waiter that it was RAW in the middle, he started an argument with me by asking me \"I thought you ordered it medium rare?\", I said \"I did, but this is RAW in the middle.\" \"So you don't want it medium rare?\" I said, \"That isn't medium rare.\" \"You sure?\" as he made a big show of bending down and examining the steak and then giving a patronizing look. \"So you would like your steak cooked medium, then?\" I said \"Medium rare\" He eventually took my plate back to the kitchen and 20 min later came out with it again. The steak was now overcooked, the sides were cold, which means they didn't keep my plate warm, the crab was now off to the side and not on top and the bearnaise sauce was cold. I know I was a single table but I didn't deserve to be treated like crap. I'm sure most people get treated better than I but I cannot recommend this place to anybody. I've had much better food and service at the Charcoal Room at Palace Station and the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Ceasers' deserves better.",

For an appetizer we of course did have the infamous stone crab which was everything I hoped it would be. Big chunks of crab that dont even need butter. But This place is far more than its namesake stone crab.  I had one of the best steaks I have ever had that night. It had a nice lightly charred layer on the outside and was buttery and tender on the inside. It makes me sad that I cant have it every time I have a steak. For sides I had there butter nut squash which was a bit to sweet for a side but I was warned by the waiter that most people order it as a dessert. For dessert they made me a wonderful birthday brownie sundae that was amazingly decadent.   The staff was great. They were friendly and informative. We asked for a nice table that was more secluded when we made our reservation and that is what we got!",

The lobster tail was succulent and sweet and the coating was delicious and crispy.  The Scallops are seasoned and poached in clarified Butter.  If you do not like scallops, this is the dish to change your mind IMO.  The Crab Bisque is great.  I am usually not a soup bisque person but I would definately have this when I come back.  And finally the Stone Crab Claws.  We got a few of the large orders steamed and we were very satisfied.  I could eat the claws alone but combined with that clarified butter it was excellent.  I have eaten here a few times before but this time was better than my previous experiences.",

If your wallet is crying, skip this place and hit up McDonalds, but if you are ready to dine than Joe's is the place to be  Ambiance 5/5 This place is inside the forum shop at Caesars, the place looks nice, really upscale and great vibe.  Service 5/5 Top notch and professional. We didn't have a reservation, but they were fine with us, we were seated pretty quick with a party of 9 of us.   Food 5/5 If you come here, you MUST order the stone crab. The crab comes chilled, when you crack it open the texture is solid and when dipped into the mustard sauce that it comes with, the crab just flat out tastes delicious. I ordered the fried seafood platter that had an assortment of different seafoods like mussel, clams, scallop, fish, shrimp, it was pretty good, the batter was great. Also had the steak cooked medium rare, and that thing was really really really good, cuts nicely, perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth. You know how people say the best tasting steaks are the ones that don't need sauce, this is that kind of steak  15/15....too good. I will be sure to make a trip to this place when I go to Vegas, if you are in town at Vegas, get up in here",

We also had Manhattan-style clam chowder and caesar salad, both of which were excellent.  Service was fantastic.

Perhaps upwards of $60 for a ribeye is standard these days, but to me that's a freakin' ripoff.  One of my dining companions, who lived in FL for many years and had regularly been to original branch of Joe's in Miami, said this did not stack up.   The claws were decently prepared and the mustard sauce for dipping was tasty, but I've been to other similar restaurants that are far better. For $100 per person, including tip with an average of one drink and a dessert split by the entire table of 6, it felt overpriced for what we received.  While perhaps a few years ago, before the economy went south, it would seem that the prices being charged were symptomatic of a worthwhile premium for eating at a certain caliber of restaurant here in Las Vegas and simply having to pay the freight in order to do so, it now seems more like desperation borne of a need to squeeze every dollar out of customers in a city that has no real gravitas.   Turn up the heat, Las Vegas, you can't be a world class city unless you mind the details and stop charging for the sake of charging. It's just not that cool here.",

I would also like to point out the Alaskan King Crab that the table shared.  Those were some of the most amazing crab legs I have had in a long, long time.  You could tell they were flown in less than 24 hours before and right off the boat.  I was in crab heaven.   Lastly, for starters...I'd recommend you get the Seafood Salad. (...and a dirty Goose martini on the rocks with stuffed olives.)  Delicious!   ps...stay away if you are on a budget.

    "text": "Not quite the earth-shattering experience I had a couple years ago, but still a great meal nonetheless. The first thing I can tell you is that the quality of their stone crabs seem to be deteriorating. On the last visit, we had the choice of picking either the large, select, or medium sized claws. This time, we had the choice of either the 7-pc medium sized claws or this other crab with a fancy name (I forget). I asked the waitress and they said it's pretty much dungeness crab.  If you're familiar with stone crabs, you know that these little suckers are hard to come by, hence the extravagant prices. It takes a while for these crabs to grow just one \"big\" claw, and when they're fully grown, they're immediately harvested, chopped off, and thrown back into the waters. Imagine if you're one of these stone crabs... it must be excruciating. It's like that alien pawn shop dude (who plays Monk) in Men in Black who keeps getting his head blown off throughout the movie. It hurts like a mother, but at least it regenerates, surely albeit slowly.  Anyway, the quality of the stone crab claw didn't seem up to par compared to the last visit. It didn't seem as sweet, as succulent, as tender, as worth the $36 or so for 7 pieces. The mustard-based dipping sauce is a must, and super tasty as usual. Obviously these are defrosted from being previously frozen, but it still had that lingering effect of just recently being thawed out.  My usual bone-in ribeye was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium. Juicy, full of flavor, I licked every inch of the leftover bone. The stuffed mushrooms we had for apps was very good, along with the roasted corn for sides. As a sure sign of fate, they even offered a glass of sparkling wine from Domaine Carneros, where my wife and I went on our first date up in Napa/Sonoma Valley about 9 years ago.   We finished off with a complimentary dessert with chocolate and ice cream, but I couldn't leave without eating of slice of their key lime pie. The waitress was a bit shocked that we (err, I) had the room for another dessert. But it was well worth the extra few hours of cardio in the gym. Rich, buttery, and tart, the key lime pie was a nice ending to another fantastic meal at Joe's.",

Got seated immediately and soon after was introduced to our waitress. Forgot her name but, her hospitality was great! I ordered the stone crab bisque and some crab claws. My friends had the Miso Glazed Seabass and Ribeye Steaks. Everything came out in a timely manner. The food was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! After our main courses we had some banana cream pie, which was some of the best pie I have ever had in my life!  The service was great, the food was delicious, and the prices are very fair. Also, what stood out was that everybody in that restaurant seemed like they enjoyed their job and weren't snobby. Which, in my opinion created a comfortable atmosphere.  5 stars!",

I have been eating at the one in Miami for some time now and I stumbled across it while in Las Vegas many years ago. I can say that I introduced my wife to stone crabs, now one of her favorites. She is French and LOVES shellfish and she was highly impressed. This one actually takes reservations and there isn't a two hour wait like in Miami. What a relief!  We always start out with salads and a few appetizers. Where we pig out is with plates of stone crabs! Duh! Their service is amazing and also their steaks are very good. Anything you order here is a good choice but stick to what they are known for and you will not be let down. It does get expensive so be careful what you are ordering!  Their service is top notch and you will not be let down by this place.",

Perfectly cooked Prime Filet Mignon needs nothing but a knife, fork and your mouth. The Lobster Tail melts in your mouth without a drop of melted butter needed. But let's be honest, butter is delicious so feel free to dunk away! Tried the two sides: Hashed Browns and Lemon Asparagus. Plenty of food for two with some to spare. Don't skip the dessert either. From their fresh baked daily pies, to their Gluten Free Brownie Sundae and a 20yr Port to cap off the night.",

The crab was sweet,  juicy, and perfectly lifted right out of the shell. OMG!   The ribeye was fantastic, as were the side dishes. If you're into brussell sprouts it is a must that you try theirs. They are splash fried and tossed in a very tasty vinegarette.    The only con was the steak knives were very dull, and the key lime pie,  although great, but a little too chilled. It was almost frozen. Overall a great dining experience! Bravo!",

    "text": "After all the rave online reviews, my husband and I couldn't wait to try this place out. We were starving but wanted to enjoy a nice meal while in Vegas. We were seated immediately and the staff was very attentive, courteous, and professional. I have nothing but great things to say about the wait staff and the restaurant atmosphere in general.   My heartburn is with the food and the amount of money paid for said food. I was underwhelmed to say the least. The first red flag was when I saw our neighbors food (the Pan Sauteed Bransizo I believe). I was in complete shock of the lack of attention and 'give a damn' shown to the plating and positioning of the food on the plate. Think...Fish.....I mean...Dry Overcooked Fish.... Lemon & Capers...White plate...that's it. Pretty sure Red Lobster plates its food better. Not to mention the fish did not look appetizing. Trust me - I have eaten at all types of restaurants (mom & pop to high priced). Never have I seen an overcooked piece of fish for $32. I would have sent it back immediately (and I'm not that person).   My husband order a caesar salad and skirt steak. It was decent, but in his words 'We could have gone to Saltgrass for better.' I'll let you be the judge of that.   I ordered the crab bisque soup, the lump crab cakes and a side of steamed asparagus. The bisque was ok. The crab cakes were not. And by now - I don't think I need to elaborate on the lack of thought put into plating the food. Now, I'm typically the person that when asked how I'm enjoying my food, I respond \"Oh everything is great! Wonderful! Thank you!\". Maybe it's because I'm several months pregnant or maybe the food was just that bad, but on the day we dined at Joe's (01/29), I just couldn't hold back. I told our waiter (who was excellent) that I was under-impressed and have had much better. He was in complete shock . I too was a little embarrassed that I let it slip out. My husband sat there in disbelief. But it was the truth and I couldn't deny it. I didn't even mention to him how horrific the steamed asparagus were - no salt, no pepper. If there was butter, it must have gotten up and walked away. We ended up being comped for the crab cakes (thanks to my awesome waiter).   Anyhow, this is the first review I've done on Yelp. I'm guilty of enjoying the fruits of everyone else's labor and just reading the reviews and making a decision - super easy and super lazy. I recognize the fault in my ways. But my experience at this restaurant was such that I felt it necessary to tell my truth - $115 worth of it (not including tip). To not review would have been doing an injustice to the next hardworking couple just looking to have a nice dinner in Vegas.",

My boyfriend and I always order the stone crab legs (market price; stone crab season is mid-Oct thru mid-May) and we split the 8 oz filet ($~50)This, along with their bread bowl is really filling and satisfying! The last time we came here it was a special occasion so we ordered \"the whale\" appetizer (market price) in addition to our usual above. It's a cold seafood sampler that comes with one king crab leg, a lobster tail, a jumbo shrimp, and ceviche. It was amazing but by the end of the meal we were SO FULL!    The service here is amazing as well!  I've also found that the food is better when you go with smaller groups. They try to bring out the food at the same time so when you eat with a big group that orders different types of entrees, some dishes could be overcooked.",

Save all that appetite for stone crab and LOAD up on them. And that's not to say the steak wasn't great! I had the bone-in ribeye... and it was great. But, after eating a few bites of the steak, I was craving the real star of the show, more of the stone crab, which were quickly inhaled at the beginning of the meal.   Great service too I might add. We told the waitress we loved the cheese bread and she loaded us up with a bunch of it on our way out which made for a great snack on our plane ride home.",

We splurged a bit for the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye, and let me just say... this thing is huge! The steak is finished with a beautiful, perfect crust that would surely make any home cook jealous.  The stone crab claws are sweet, succulent, and juicy and come with an amazing mustard sauce. The shells effortlessly fall off the claw since they're pre-cracked. However, I found the medium claws a bit too small for me, so next time I would probably get the larger, more expensive claws for more meatiness.  The key lime pie is another must. This thing is chilled to the point of almost being frozen, with a soft, elastic texture reminiscent of gelato. It's REALLY good, probably my favorite key lime pie ever.  The only thing I didn't care for? The bread basket. Save your appetite for the main course!",

We ended up there around 830pm on a Thursday night.  They had some TV's so we could watch the Golden Knights game.  We were seated right away at a high top table.  It took a bit for our order to be taken.  The waitress did not seem that focused on our table since she was also serving a couple of larger tables.  I found the service was somewhat inattentive.   GF started with the Manhattan Clam Chowder and I had the crab bisque.  The soup/chowders were tasty but could have been warmer.  GF then ordered the Skirt Steak.  It was well-prepared and quite tender.  I had the Fish and Chips.  The Halibut was nice and I found that the batter was not too heavy.  I would eat it again.  For dessert, GF had the fresh berries with whipped cream ($10.95??  Way too expensive for a small bowl of fruit) and I had the Banana Pie (very good).  Dinner for two with one alcoholic beverage (i had Diet Coke - individual bottles not non-stop) was $130 plus tip.  I'm glad I've tried out the restaurant as I have been meaning to do so for quite some time.  Now that's it's crossed off the list, I don't feel the need to go back any time soon.",

The only complaint that I have, again, is with Mr. Maitre d.  We arrived early.  There wasn't a lot of people ahead of us and no one behind us.  We had to wait for our reservation time and when we finally got seated, looking around, there was 2 or 3 other small tables, ready to be seated as well.  I would've understood if he communicated with us and said that, \"We have open tables but the kitchen is running a little behind and we couldn't even offer you water service just yet so please be patient.\"  But he didn't say a word to us while chatting with his cronies.  It's been like this every time with this gentleman.  Only time I've felt this way was from doormen at clubs.  But hey, we're here for the food, not the friendly guy out front right?",

Super filled with crab meat and not totally fried all around.......soooooo delicious!! I also had the butternut squash with toasted marshmallows (seasonal), also delicious!! Hubby had the crab bisque (delicious) and fish and chips (he really enjoyed them!).  Fish was all white and flaky - perfect!  Also a fun bread basket as an appetizer.  Highly recommend.  Plan to go back next time I'm in Vegas.",

We were seated in the back away from the noise but it was freezing in there so we decided to move out front to at least be comfortable. The food made up for it though. You can't go wrong ordering the crab here. Both the claws and cakes were very good. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "I really like the steak here. As a resident of LA, I still haven't found a place that serves a great steak other than this place in Vegas. Although I do have a somewhat limited steak repertoire since I haven't tried many of the Midwest steakhouses, my parents make a fabulous steak so I feel that I'm qualified to judge a great steak.  I've tried Mastros and I thought it was merely adequate.   I like the steak at Joe's. We also had the stone crab claws which were delicious. We also had the key lime pie and the peanut butter dessert. I thought they were really good.  One nice option is that you can have them give you half portions of the desserts.  All in all, this is one of my favorite places so we really want to come back here all the time.",

Sadly they had NO flavor.I ordered the Joe's Scallops and had to sadly send them back and replaced them with the Ahi Tuna..which was good...nothing out of this world but none the less good...Now on to the OUTSTANDING parts of the experience.  #1 our server Andrew...ASK FOR HIM!! Hes incredible..very attentive without being annoying, very knowledgeable and gave great feedback on the dishes we ordered..We will be requesting him when we return. #2 The appetizers we ordered were INCREDIBLE...great calamari and the Lobster crab greatin was OUT OF THIS WORLD..must get!!!! #3 I don't eat meant but my boyfriend got the 12oz filet and said it was one of the best steaks hes ever had and was so tender he could cut it with a fork #4 we shared the steamed broccoli DELISH!!!! When they tell you the sides are large portion they aren't lying 3 people could easily have shared the broccoli but i LOVE broccoli so it was great for just the 2 of us. #5 OMG!!! DESSERT!!!! AHHHHH...i would never have tried this hidden little treasure if it weren't for my boyfriends brother telling me to get it Peppermint Gelato with hot fudge drizzles on top...its HUGE and the waiter brings it to you and pours the fudge on it table side!! HIGHLY recommend!!!!  My boyfriend got the Apple Pie A la mode...DELISH as well...HUGE too...perfect amount of crunch loads of thin slivers of apples...just so so so good!!  All around great experience! We will definitely be returning! And we will definitely be requesting Andrew :)  I would have given 4 and a half stars but it doesn't allow halves and it was def better than 4 stars so 5 it is!!!",

(Large is supposed to give you the most meat with the least amount of effort.)  It was good, but not worth the $55 price tag for 5 claws.    The scallops were okay, but in my opinion, a little over done.  The assortment of bread was good.    I would go back, but to try something else.",

Having no idea what we were in for, we ordered the stone crab.  Stone crab is a slightly sweet, completely wonderful crab which I have since started ordering from the original Joe's in Miami direct to my house.  The bread basket was great - lots of choices - and the filet and bacon wrapped scallops were out of this world.  While it is a bit pricey - the food is well worth it.  Great for special occasions - which is every trip to Las Vegas!",

I'm no seafood expert, but the actual Stone Crab appetizer (it's a bunch of claws!) tastes really great. It tastes... more like crab than regular crab.  Yeah, uh... So like,  regular crab flavor is like calling it a few times over the week until it finally agreed to meet you at a coffee shop and when it did show up, it was dressed in these gnarly sweats but it's wearing nice perfume. Stone Crab immediately shows up to your house in lingerie on speed dial. I mean, you know. If Stone Crab were an attractive woman and you were a heterosexual dude. Oh yeah, and the mustard sauce you dip the Stone Crab in is the lingerie--it's flavorful and not overtly spicy.  I also ordered the Seafood Chop Salad, which I really enjoyed. It has all these colors! I don't know why (you can guess, maybe?) but my salad was covered in a good layer of seafood that I couldn't even finish. Sooo... if you like salads and like eating your fill of seafood (and maybe if you're a tiny person like me), get the salad with Joe's vinagrette sauce.",

My gf ordered a king crab appetizer, but half the meat was like opaque white mush, I'm not sure what the problem was because it didnt smell bad or anything. They brought a new one and it was fine. Why did they give us the funky one in the first place? This place seems a little chauvinistic, as the tables with men at them seemed to get better service. Sadly, this kind of macho discrimination seems all too common at these kinds if places.",

We sat in the entry part of the restaurant, which I like because you can people watch and it isn't as loud in my opinion as inside the restaurant.  The stone crab claws are a MUST ORDER. They're a delicious appetizer and come with a mustard sauce that is very enjoyable.  Back to the service, the waiter comes over with lemon and hot towels after you eat to clean your hands! That is awesome :)  For dinner we ordered NY steak, cut into strips. We also ordered crab legs, hashbrowns, and fried asparagus. Everything was cooked very well and came out at once. One of the bussers cracked the legs for us at the side of the table which made eating it so easy!  Wow. I can't say enough good things about this place.  It's definitely pricey but worth the price. You get what you pay for here and everything we had was phenomenal.  The only criticism I have is about dessert... Which was still good. I'm lactose intolerant and every dessert had milk in it of some kind. I can't have dessert at most restaurants, and luckily I was able to order apple pie without the ice cream, but I would have loved to have more variety. It was a huge piece of pie and the presentation was still great.",

By the time I was 1/2 way through the huge king crab legs and the rock crab claws, I had enough.  Both were really good but I reached a point where I lost the savory satisfaction and just wanted to finish it because it was so expensive.  Don't get me wrong, the first bite of the meaty king crab legs was exquisite but in the middle of the second leg, I think I was done.    The rock crab legs are a lot firmer than I expected (like it had been frozen) but it was also tasty.  I thought the king crab legs were better though.    The mustard sauce is not as good as it is made out to be.  It was really disappointing so I stuck with the drawn butter.    The service was excellent.",

We then split the 16oz bone in filet mignon and The 5 piece order of stone crabs  The steak was probably one of the best I have ever had, I had it med rare and was so delicious, I couldnt believe it.  The stone crabs did not let down either, They are served chilled with a mustard dipping sauce, so good I wanted more.  We then finished it off with a banana cream pit. Nom Nom:)  Our server was a dark haired woman that i forgot her name but she may have been one of the only female servers there on friday shift. Great suggestions and staff was very attentive. 5 stars all the way!",

They go out of their way to make you feel welcomed and happy.  The king crab legs are sweet and delicious, and the stone crab is just as good. The petite filet is delicious and filling, it comes with an really good grilled tomato.  They make a great cocktail, too, the best Old Fashioneds and Martinis you'll ever have.

Save your money in the steak and seafood, just go for dessert and the Oysters Rockefeller. I hate it when restaurants live off the nostalgia of yesterday year and charge their current customers, for a reputation that they can no longer live up to. My mother ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, which were great--you only get four. Stop there at the appetizers, skip their over-priced, poorly flavored stone crab and go straight to dessert. We had the crab stuffed jumbo shrimp. The shrimp are over cooked and you only get four (they cost over $30). My father got the grilled seafood platter, which was nearly $50. The coleslaw is watered down and pour my mixed table side and the creamed spinach has no flavor except the heavy-handed nutmeg. We ended dinner with Coconut-Creamed Pie. It was worth every penny.",

Well we went with a big group of 9 adults and two kids.... We were seated in the private dining room to the very very back... we had the whole room to ourselves and there was a TV to watch the UCLA get demolished that night....  Usually we eat at the bar area and this was the first time sitting in the dining room.  Service was spot on by the waiter... he gave us some hints at what to was good on the sides for the table and the specials...  Well I had the Bone in New York strip Med Rare... it came out nice and juicy... Well worth it and packed with flavor... They waiter also gave me a seasoning mix that they make if i wanted to season my steak a little more then they had..and instead of using the table salt and pepper..  This seasoning was good... wish I could get the recipe...  For sides we ordered mushrooms.. they were very good Lyonnaise potatoes... just like they should be made... I tried to take more them my fair share... The special side was some corn dish... so good we ordered an extra for the table... well worth it....  OOOHH I forgot my BLT Wedge Salad.... this salad had a nice sweet twist that went well with the salty bacon.... a must try for wedge lovers.  And for desert... the waiter steered us clear of several of the items... and said their signature desert was the Key lime pie...made with Key limes shipped in from Florida  Great choice nice and tart and the graham cracker crust was nice and solid...not soggy like others...  This place has always been a great place and this experience def made it a 5 star experience!!!",

The service was so nice, we all had different questions and our waiter had perfect recommendations and was knowledgeable about every thing on the menu! I believe our experience was even better because he was able to recommend what wine to pair with which dish, how to eat oysters (and which sauces to add flavor), and what was best for a group to share to eat.

He did an excellent job and we made it in time to Celine.  We ordered Stone Crab as an appetizer to share. It was good but I think they over cracked it, every piece of meat came with a tiny piece of shell with it.   I ordered the Chilean Sea bass. Very good. Very buttery and full of flavor.

The Mac & Cheese was extremely good with a nice crust on top.  We both HIGHLY recommend the stone crab.  The seafood is flown in daily from Florida each morning so you know the stone crab is going to fresh.  Also if you ever decide to go ask for Joe as your server (he's the only Joe at the restaurant btw).  He was honestly the BEST server I ever had.  He helped us decide and answered any questions we had about the food items.  Very friendly and and helpful.  He even got us a free slice of pie for desert.

He just knows what's best. The wine selection is vast. We split a bottle of some kind of merlot. I am not a wine person and I cannot quite remember what it was called, but I do remember what the label looked like. Point being: the bottle was worth it. Especially since we were at a different restaurant the night before we ended up getting two glasses each and it cost more than the price of that fine bottle.  The food. I had the oscar-style filet mignon and he had the rib-eye. Mine was so good, he did not get to taste the magical surf and turf on my plate. But, I snuck a taste of the rib-eye and almost cried. I couldn't believe it. It was so yummy. We split the ginormous baked-potato for a side and the peanut butter pie for dessert. The pie was like a Reese's Peanut Butter cup on steroids with whipped cream. ::drool::  The restaurant itself was like eating at your rich friend's mansion's dining room except with a bunch of strangers. The lighting was dim, but inviting. The walls had pictures of old people and sports teams and boats. I think we had the best seat in the house cuz the table opened up to the whole room, but the booth that we were in was spaced out from the rest of the booths around the room where you actually get to sit next to your honey and have a private, silly conversation. This place was nice and I want to go back again. You know, or go to the one in Chicago.",

The complimentary bread assortment was so delicious.  We were walking along the Vegas strip all day and didn't realize how hungry we were until we sat down.  Thank goodness for the fresh gourmet bread & butter!  For starters we ordered the seafood salad and the crab bisque.  The seafood salad was refreshing, but the crab bisque truly stood out.  My boyfriend loved it.  It had chunks of crab in there!  Then came two orders of the medium stone crabs served with a dipping sauce that was to die for.  The crabs were perfectly chilled and so meaty.  We also ordered  sweet potato fries.  They were very yummy too.  We were so stuffed I didn't have room to try their key lime pie.

I can honestly say this is the best lobster bisque I've ever had! It's also the only, however, so I should clarify that by saying it was very very good, even if it was a poor example of what a lobster bisque should be.   The wife had fish tacos, which she devoured so I will assume that means they were delicious. I had the fish and chips, which was absolutely excellent. I've had plenty of fish and chips in my life so I've got some frame of reference here. Very very good.  The absolute crown jewel dish of the night wasn't even a dish at all. It was the tartar sauce that came with the fish and chips. The tartar sauce was without a doubt, far and away, bar none, the best I have ever had. Without question. Absolutely and incredibly delicious.  The sides we ordered were also very good, the fries and potatoes we got were cooked well and tasted fresh. My only issue was the asparagus. The asparagus itself was good but came out covered in tomatoes which was NOT good at all. This was because of my personal bias against tomatoes in most things. The wife loves tomatoes and ate a few pieces with no issue. Although I expected her to eat more, so perhaps it wasn't so great for her either.",

Started out w a great bread basket. We split the veggie chopped salad which was surprisingly good and huge. Stone crab bisque was disappointingly ordinary but I really liked that they brought out the bowl with crab and veggies, then added the bisque tableside. Genius way to make sure everybody gets the same amount of crab.   We shared the steak sandwich - unexpectedly 3 little sliders vs 1 regular sandwich. Thick slices of tender medium rare steak. Maybe not worth $17 but it was damn good. We also shared the 8oz filet with sides - super fresh tasting charred sweet corn, sauteed broccolini and mac & cheese. Perfect char and seasoning on the steak but sides were just average, I wouldn't say any were really worth the calories or $    No time for dessert since we were headed to absinthe but the menu looked great. The place was packed for a Thursday, service was pretty good although a waiter did shoulder check me on our way out without an excuse me, but fuckit.   Bill for 3 including a bottle of wine was $160 before tip. Not somewhere I NEED to return to, but it was overall a good experience",

The crab claws were good, but we prefer the  COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE ($14.95) because it comes with the same tasty mustard dipping sauce and you don't have to get your hands all messy.    The SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD ($16.95) a great salad to split with someone else, just let your waiter know you'll be sharing it and it comes out with 2 huge portions.    Our absolute favorite is the STONE CRAB BISQUE ($6.95 a bowl) I want to lick the bowl clean everytime I get this.    They open at 11:30am daily, get there as soon as you can for really quick service!",

    "text": "I made a reservation on 09/28/15, party of ten, for two patio tables of five because we had two Lettuce Entertain You $25.00 coupons, which state \"one coupon\" per table and because a long table of ten is not conducive to conversation.  I called to confirm on 09/29 and to increase the guest count to eleven.  This morning, prior to lunch, Joe's called me to confirm my reservation for ten. I corrected them that the reservation is for eleven, not ten, two tables on the patio, one of (5) and one of (6).  Upon arrival, a long table of four-tops had been set for eleven people. Two people had to sit pressed together at the end of the table which was uncomfortable for those guests.  We advised the waiter that we had two $25.00 coupons which he declined, allowing one per table.  Maitre d Thomas offered to reassemble us into two tables to accommodate the discount coupons, however we chose to remain seated as we were rather than create ruckus at the lunch hour.  Another reason for specifically asking for two tables was that it becomes a bookkeeping headache to breakdown a check of eleven people as most guests prefer to pay by credit card; this is essentially a business lunch.  Our waiter said separate checks are not allowed but that he could break the table into three checks.  The $25.00 coupon was applied to all three checks, the tip of course, was added to the total bill.  We managed to dissect the bill, figure the discount and the tip and make arrangements to repay the person who paid by credit card.  I had announced to the reservations person, Kayla, that we are locals, as she indeed could see by my phone number in Joe's records.  The point of my message is that we were extremely disappointed in today's transaction with Joe's Seafood. Regretfully, I believe we'll hold our monthly luncheons elsewhere and sadly, this sort of experience discourages future repeat business.",

The stone crab is out of this world, cooked to perfection and the bring it to you with the shell already cracked so there is no fight when it comes to getting to the meat- you just basically peal the broken pieces off and ohh man.... it just melts in your tongue and their mustard sauce is the icing on the cake.

The wait staff was in tuxedos, classy, and real personal able, we were fortunate to have the best waiter, he was simply a charmer.  I got the rib eye, it was melt in your mouth tender but the flavour seemed to be a little lacking, maybe it was me but it seemed to be a bit bland.  The restaurant was an older established place that based itself on stone crabs, stone crabs are okay but if you have been fortunate enough to have had dungness crab, it's hard to compare. I did have ceasar salad and we did ask for the anchovies, because it's not a ceasar salad without anchovies.  The salad was not the best ceasar salad I've had, I do love ceasar salad. My friend ordered her favorite, key lime pie, unfortunately I think my sis makes a better key lime pie even though their key lime wasn't bad but I'm biased to my sis's pie.",

The service provided by the waitress was decent. The Hispanic waiter who brought us water was super cool. The food was decent at best I have had better seafood at restaurants for a fraction of the price.   The bread they bring to the table has a variety to it and is decent. The flavor of the Crab Bisque was good. Definitely something that I would suggest ordering. The Seafood Pasta is a pesto based pasta with various seafood in it. The King Crab is killer of course. Other then that the dish is simply okay. The Grilled Seafood Platter is okay as well; the lobster tails are small, the shrimp was hard and over cooked, and the scallops were small and not cooked to perfection either. The old fashioned apple pie was cold, not what I expect when it comes to pie with ice cream.  Overall, it was underwhelming and would not come back. Would definitely look at other seafood restaurants if I was back in the area.",

We got Selects and I swear in Tampa these are SMALLS.  Stone Crabs are NOT in season in FL til Oct 15, so I was happy to get some as were my friends from Ohio.  But the Selects were not as good as I have had in the past. But service is impeccable and this is really a great place to eat! Oh yeah and unlike the original in Miami , the one in Vegas DOES TAKE reservations!",

Walking in we quickly felt under dressed with staff all suit up who treated us with equal courteous service just the same. The food is no less than AAA Diamond rating, pretty much same rating as the luxury hotel that houses it!",

    "text": "MY FAVORITE PLACE TO GO FOR A STEAK. I am from Orange County and I drive the four hours just to come here for dinner and then go home. It's that worth it to me. We always make a reservation and we are always seated upon arrival. They have a complimentary bread basket that offers a variety of breads to try. The highlight of the restaurant is definitely the stone crab. I like that it's broken up for easier eating and I also like the sauce that comes with it. The ousters were also delicious but I would pick the stone crab over it. The steaks are also amazing and perfectly cooked. I don't know what else I could even say about it except that you need to try it. I've been to many steakhouses and I definitely prefer the steaks from joe's. I saved everyone's favorite part for last which is the Havana dream pie and I think that everyone should try this. The cake i believe is Dulce de leche flavor and it is topped with whipped cream and served with a side of strawberries. It is so moist and isn't overly sweet either which is why it is definitely one of my favorite deserts. 5 stars well deserved not only for the food but for the amazing service of the staff. The waiters are all so friendly and they make conversation with you and I would have never even tried the Havana dream pie if it wasn't given to us as a complimentary desert on my last visit. Not only do I keep coming back but I would definitely travel to Vegas for that! Just superb.",

    "text": "So we came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. We had reservations for a party of 12 and they reserved the back private room for us. The private room did have a surcharge with it of around $12-$15. We were a bit late for our reservations but they were able to accommodate us. We were seated at a large rectangle table that was very spacious for a big party.   We were served fresh variety bread basket and drinks. Our server came around with menus and did a walk-through of their specialties. I ended up getting the medium stone crab and jennie's mashed potatoes while the bf got the king crab roll. Their famous stone crabs were indeed fresh! It was refreshing and the sauce that it came with was paired well together. But the crabs were hard to open even being cracked already. The crabs were also very cold and didn't have much flavor to it. I was expecting a burst of sweet and juiciness. The king crab roll was filled with crab but it was also on the colder side. The mashed potatoes were alright...It was mashed potatoes with ooey gooey cheese...but it was also cold as well so the cheese had already thickened. I also got to try the dry aged steak which was very juicy! But it did contain a large amount of fat and cartilage parts.  The mashed potatoes were around $10. Medium stone crabs were $50. The king crab roll was $26. Of course, some dishes were market priced so it may vary depending when you go.    Overall, our group enjoyed our meal but the food could have been better. The service was great! We were attended to all throughout the night and were never neglected. Our waters were always filled and they brought out our wine and served us properly.",

It's the fluffiest warmest thing I have ever got my hands on. All the bread comes out fresh and warm. The large flatbread in the back is the next best thing after that.  For my main, I ordered the marinated skirt steak. This was a long skinny cut. I wouldn't say it was heavy at all for steak. I asked for it to be cooked medium rare, and it came out slightly more on the medium side. It was tender and the lime butter flavors were excellent with the Shishito peppers.  They pour you Fiji water, the good stuff, in lieu of the usual fountain water. This is a major plus for me.",

So while it may sound bad, its actually better than death for sure,  and I get to feel better knowing I am eating some of the most amazing crab meat around that is sustainable in the real way.   So Joes is the original real deal here.   Pricey for sure.  But lets face it.  You don't do this every day.  So SPLURGE a little!  Plus you are in vegas where all the places are super expensive.   The lunch deal here is the best.  With the Crab claws, hash browns with onions ( to die for super crispy ) , made at the table fresh coleslaw also a winner.  Nice bread basket too.  But you can still order this way for dinner,  it's just more money.   Had a steak here once which was also quite good but better places for steak in vegas.    Hey... its all about the Stone Crabs here.  If you don't get those then you are doing yourself a disservice.  When you go to place that is all about \"one thing\",  then you best be gettin that \"one thing\" and it best be \"good\".   And at Joes you just won the triple crown if you do it.  So just DO IT!",

    "text": "I'm a complete and total sucker. Well, that should be obvious by the simple fact that today is my 3rd trip to Las Vegas in 2019 and we are 19 days into the month of April. I'll write a \"sucker's manifesto\" someday coveing that vast topic, but that's not where I was going with this metaphor. I'm a sucker in the sense that my imagination mixed with extremely high expectations, allows me to believe, truly believe, that I should dine at a place purely based on status and/or a 4 star review.   I knew better than to park my derriere at this spot. On a molecular level, I knew better. When it comes to decision making, as is the case here, I lack the quintessential necessity to walk away and go somewhere else, hence, I'm a sucker!  We dined here this afternoon and decided to just have some appetizers.   We split a bowl of chowder, which is red chowder, at this location.   Chowder:  It's a liquidy broth that resembles ramen broth, at best. Chowder, in the Bay Area, where I came from, is a thick, delicious consistency.  The flavors were solid, but it was too brothy for my taste and I would be absolutely shocked if an entire clam found his way into my bowl. I didn't love it as much as I wanted to. Again, my imagination painted a very different picture than what hit the table and I can rename this veggie soup if you'd like. Add a few A B C pasta shells and call it alphabet soup.  Fried Calamari:   Weak at best. Poorly fried, lacked flavor and just missed the mark from nose to tail. This is not a dish that requires a high level of technique so there are no excuses to be made.   Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail:  Exceptionally clean and perfectly cooked prawns. Absolutely delicious and I could eat 2 dozen on my own. Very well prepared and this is where star number 3 comes into play.   I so badly wanted Stone Crab but I just could not pull the trigger to spend $65 on crab claws for lunch and we probably should have gone this route.   I'm glad we had lunch instead of a formal dinner because if this is the level of quality for dinner, that could easily run up a $200 tab, I'd be agitated AF!  For those of you who love this place and swear by it, congrats and good for you. I'm happy for you and wish you all the best on your journey towards mediocre dining. Cheers.",

Our Maitre D, Thomas was out of this world! Not only was his customer service incredible he was attentive, entertaining and gave us some fabulous recommendations on what to try.   It's an absolute MUST to try the stone crab....holy cow it is delicious! The home made sauce that accompanies the stone crab really ties the dish all together.   Personally, I'm not a huge meat person so I decided to take a gander at the Vegetarian menu. I ordered the Cauliflower Steak. So intrigued by this dish, it did not disappoint!!! That was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. It's a vegetarian's dream. The cauliflower was topped with apple, fennel and cilantro. All these flavors meshed together so well. It was crunchy, juicy and flavorful. Not to mention, very filling.   Our whole table was so satisfied with the experience, ambiance and food. I would highly recommend Joe's to anyone!",

Came here with high expectations, the servers are all in tuxedos and are very professional. We were seated shortly after checking in for our reservation. This place is like a Michelin star rated restaurant.  We ordered a lot of different items to try, the server made great recommendations and we went with them. We even tried the steak to see how well they do that.  Seafood was fresh, delicious, and the items that were cooked were perfect in every way. Steak was on par with a Ruth Chris or Flemings, we were very impressed.  We wanted to try almost all of the desserts so we ordered half slices knowing we won't have too much wasted food.  From beginning to end the meal was fabulous, loved the server checking up on us ever 5 minutes or so.  Can't wait to go back and try some their crab legs as they said they are famous for that as well.  Can't go wrong here with anything.",

    "text": "Excellent meal and experience at this fine dining restaurant inside the Caesar's shops! We started off our meal with a nice cold margarita. The drink was made with fresh ingredients and there was plenty of alcohol, be careful if you order one! The appetizer was oysters Rockefeller. The preparation was excellent. The oysters were perfectly tender, in a silky cheese sauce on a bed of spinach. The cheese on top was toasted to perfection. I then had the crabcakes as my meal. I think calling them cakes do them an injustice, as it was all crab meat, no filler. I also got a side of mac & cheese which was excellent. The shells were in a smooth cheese sauce topped with another layer of cheese. This place has a romantic ambience and was a great fine dining experience!",

The seafood was cooked PERFECTLY, extremely flavorful, and priced well. The customer service was spot on. Raul took great care of us, handling each of our personalities as if it were no bother...but trust me we are an interesting group!   Oysters Rockefeller- TO DIE FOR!!! My friend had never eaten oysters and loved it!  Grilled Seafood Platter- Absolutely delicious! I've never in my 35 years had scallops cooked so perfectly.  Stuffed Shrimp- Huge chunks of crab meat in every bite.   We chose brocollini and baked Mac and cheese as sides. The brocollini was fresh and cooked just the right amount to ensure there were plenty of nutrients left (hate overcooked veggies). The mac and cheese could have been better but also could have been worst. I rate that a 3/5. However, it did not take away from the overall experience.  We received a complimentary desert for my darling friend's birthday which was a nice surprise.  All four of us left soooooo happy with this restaurant. On my next trip to Vegas, I will be returning to Joe's.",

We stopped in for a few cocktails and ceviche after receiving a recommendation from a waitress at Cut Steakhouse. The ceviche was fantastic, the service was not especially inviting or friendly, though they were fast.",

They serve a little bowl of salt/steak seasoning on the side, was excellent! Never before gotten excited by a restaurant Bread basket. WOWSER. Joe's has 6 kinds of bread-- a corn muffin to die for (!!), parmesan crisp, pretzel roll, fruit/nut bread, etc. Outstanding! One should not fill up on bread before a big meal, but in this case..... so DELISH! Started with Stone Crab claws (they're served COLD). Succulent and sweet, fun to crack & get the meat. Loved the accompanying sauce (mayo/ horseradish). Didn't know they remove claws from the crabs and throw them back in the sea, where the crabs live to grow more claws. So no crabs were killed in the making of your appetizer! Staff were excellent. Our server, Raul, did an outstanding job. Between courses, they come by and squeeze fresh lemon on your hands and give you a hot hand towel. Hubs' steak was great too (I had NY, he had Rib Eye), just cooked perfectly. Our side dish was Lyonnaise potatoes, so good, but who had room for them?!!? Got a complimentary ice cream brownie dessert for my B'day, a perfect ending to the fabulous meal. Food=A, Service= A++.",

We were celebrating my wife's Bday, and although she said Happy b-day, it was as she was rushing by. Basically just no personality, and made us feel like \"here's your food, enjoy, now get out\". I don't need someone waiting on us hand and foot, but personality goes a long way, and for the price, I wish the staff had more of that, instead of making is feel like \"here's your stuff, now give me your money\".

My gang decided to come here because we saw pictures and great reviews so we decided this was the place to go for our last night in Vegas. I was really excited about ordering pasta because I was craving it the entire trip. The only choice they have for pasta is the Seafood Pasta for $42.95. Never had I ever ordered pasta that expensive before but because it was my first time in Vegas since I turned 21 and it was the last day, so I said why not? My girlfriends ordered the Seafood pasta but decided to split between them. When the food came, the waiter told my girlfriends that he split the pasta for them and put it on separate plates to make their life easier. He, then, handed my plate and I was in shock. My full order pasta was exactly the same size as their split order. Are you serious?? I am paying $42.95 for pasta that looks exactly the same portion as theirs. My friends were also in shock when the food came and it was the same portion. We wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt by asking if my portion was split in thirds. The waiter said it was not and I have a full meal. I am assuming that he expressed our concerns to the manager because he came by just to see how everything was. The waiter then came to explain what happened to our plates. APPARENTLY, because my meal was a full meal, I received more seafood and LESS pasta while my girlfriends had an equal amount of seafood but MORE pasta. Honestly, I'm unsure if he realized how ridiculous that sounds because wouldn't the chef add more pasta and the same amount of seafood just to make my meal look as if I order a FULL meal?? I literally took like 6 bites (maybe less) of my pasta and I was still hungry afterwards. Taste of the pasta?? It was very weak. It did not have enough sauce and no taste at all. The seafood was terrible and bland. Overall, I spent $56 including tips on a terrible meal that was like 6 bites. I wanted to buy dessert at the restaurant but I was worried their dessert was not proportion LIKE their pasta. I had to go to a bakery to buy dessert.   Would I go there again? Nope. I rather go to Olive Garden than go back there for pasta or maybe the food court that serves Italian food.",

Came here for dinner with a group of friends. Me and one friend shared a bottle of white wine. I got the fish and chips, which were AMAZING! Literally the fish melted in my mouth. I also tried the stone crab which was to die for! Tried the cream spinach and potato w/cheese side which were tasty and went great with the stone crab. I got the banana cheesecake with caramel sauce for dessert and it was also so tasty. Seriously everything I tried was so damn good!!!! A bit pricey, but well worth the splurge.",

    "text": "This place was decent.  Service (4/5): We wanted to grab a nice meal before heading back home. Came across Joes and thought, \"why not\" since we didn't take the time to have a nice sit down meal in Vegas. The place was packed so the only available seating was located at the bar and we were seated immediately there. The service was extremely slow for our table even though other bar tables who sat and ordered after us were served their food first. Personally I didn't even notice but my friend was upset. After the waitress apologized about 3-4 times to me I realized we did wait quite a long time for our food.  Food: Crab Bisque (4.5): We ordered a cup of the bisque to try. It had good flavor just was slightly too salty. It was served in a small bowl with some kind of veggie medley garnish.   Wedge Salad (5/5): The wedge salad was as good as they get. It was large enough to share between 2-3 people. The crispy pork belly was a great alternative to regular bacon. The pork belly was cut into cubes so you get thick, squarish pieces.   Seared Sea Scallops (2/5): It comes with 4 scallops, decent size. It is plated on mashed cauliflower with bacon jam. We were definitely anticipating this dish after ordering it but unfortunately it was a disappointment. The scallops were a little bit overcooked so they were slightly tough. And they were extremely salty. Fortunately, our server took it off our bill.   Stone Crab (4/5): I would say this was good crab for crab being eaten cold. We ordered the medium size which came with about 7 claws. They were pre cracked and each claw was decent size. It was served with lemon and a side of a mustard like dipping sauce. My friend and I weren't a fan of the sauce. Overall the crab was good for what is was, but I still think king crab legs, stone crab and like are better eaten hot and when sauteed in a sauce.",

It was the best tasting crab legs I have ever had. I had a half dozen kunamoto oysters, they were excellent - fresh with the usual accompanying dressings. I was in the mood for just a small serving of steak so I ordered the petite filet. It was cooked to perfection - pink in the middle and juicy. Something about the way they seared the steak created an amazing flavor and texture. It had a slightly charred character that made me crave the next bite before I finished chewing the current one. I was hesitant to add their peppercorn seasoning to the steak because I like to taste just the steak, but once I did, it was addictingly good. The mashed potatoes were covered in a parmesan crust. Delicious. Overall I have to say that this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. I highly recommend.  I almost forgot to mention, the manager, Tim, was incredibly helpful, cordial, and professional. His recommendations were spot on, and we could tell that he had a genuine interest in making sure we had the best dining experience possible. He really helped make the experience enjoyable and memorable.",

    "text": "We chose Joe's specifically because of the reviews and awards. We left fully understanding why they have been in business for over 100 years. It's a simple plan really: Do one thing and do it well. Joe's knows seafood! And in our opinion, Joe's prices are perfectly matched to the quality of the product and the delivery of the service. Dining at Joe's was an experience, not just a meal. And we love when dining out is a complete experience!  Our visit started off on the right foot. We approached the Host stand and were greeted with a smile by a gentlemen in a black tux. I gave him our name and he was expecting us, knew we were from St. Louis and knew we had a dining club back home. Bonus points for being so detail-oriented and for paying attention to the notes I put in our reservation. His name was Gabe. He then directed us to a beautifully dressed table (The tables were dressed to the hilt and the chairs were very comfortable and conducive to a leisurely sit. A beautifully dressed table is the second sign of a good restaurant. Hint: the first sign is how you are greeted by the host/hostess) and handed us the lunch menu, special menu for the day and the extensive wine list. He informed us our server would be Perry and wished us an enjoyable meal. Well done, Gabe!  Even though the restaurant seemed fairly full (a great sign for a Monday at noon during the two slowest weeks in Vegas!), Perry was over in a millisecond to greet us. He was professional, efficient, friendly, was quick to give us a bit of background on the restaurant and their goals, and offered us bottled or tap water. I love it when the waiter, manager, chef, etc., take the time to give you some history and explain the restaurant's goal. It gives me an idea of what to expect and some insight into why the menu is the way it is.  To start things off, we ordered wine (Riesling, Dr. Pauly-Bergweiler, Noble House, Mosel, GER) by the glass ($8 - very reasonable and a deep pour), but we would have preferred a half-bottle, but there were no Rieslings offered that way. That was a bit of a bummer, but their wine list is extensive, so I feel most people would find many choices to select from. Bottle prices ranged from $40's to $7k with a lot in the $40-$70 range. With that, we received a bread basket with several fresh-made choices to munch while we made our selections.  This day was about shellfish! For our appetizer, we selected the Madagascar Shrimp ($17 ea). It's grilled and served shell removed, head on. The server finished the prep at tableside. It is hands down the largest shrimp I've ever eaten, much less seen! It had to be 8 inches long (no joke, folks, see the picture with reference to the server's hand) and probably was 6-7oz after cooking. We split ONE and it was plenty as an appetizer. It was grilled to perfection; I highly recommend this.  Our \"second course\" was the Jumbo Alaskan King Crab (6oz appetizer portion $22). It was served beautifully, over ice, pre-cracked, and garnished such that it was a sight for the eyes in addition to the taste buds! The chilled, drawn butter was superb. It was real, True drawn butter and it added to the crab, instead of detracting from it. Although, the crab did stand on its own.  For our \"third course\" we shared the Joe's Classic Two-Course Luncheon Special. It consisted of five medium Stone Crab Claws (I thought they were very large for medium claws), Hashed Browns, Cole Slaw and Key Lime Pie ($35 - an excellent deal for this price!). So, the Stone Crab - perfection! The meat is sweet, smooth and melts in your mouth. Seriously the best crab I've eaten. The hashed browns are very good, without being overly engineered. Now, the cole slaw. Oh. My. God. It comes out of the kitchen as cabbage, apple cider vinegar, Hellmann's mayo, sweet pickle relish, some pepper, salt and sugar. Perry mixed it table side and it was out of this world! The best slaw ever!!!  And lastly, the Key Lime Pie. It should be noted that I don't eat pie. But my husband had his first bite and raved about it, so I felt I had to try it...you know, for the sake of a complete review! Let me say, it was heaven! I'm fairly certain not all Key Lime pies taste like that, so I am not ready to call myself a pie lover, but I'd eat Joe's Key Lime again in a heartbeat! It's brightness was the perfect note to end on after the richness of our crab and shrimp.  At the end, Perry came by with lemons and a hot towel. He squeezed lemon over our hands, then laid the hot towel over them and rubbed a bit. We finished off the process and were super glad they do that since we'd certainly dove right in with our fingers for this delicious meal!  Overall, superb experience! Food, service, atmosphere - all excellent. And, in my opinion, appropriately priced for the quality of what you receive.",

Everything else wonderful. I might note that the mustard sauce used for the stone crab claws is the more delicious standard, NOT what is served at the Original Joe's.     The service was impeccable and the server noticed my hardly touched bi-valves. Generously, he had the dish re-maid and fully replaced. It was a very kind but the second try was worse than the first. I felt compelled to eat round two anyway because of his generous gesture. They were simply horrible so over cooked you practically needed a steak knife.  Everything else we had that night was lovely, the shrimp and crab and chopped salad. Thank you Joe's for the over the top attempt to please! The front of the house could write the book on hospitality, but I am afraid the kitchen needs a cooking lesson.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Joe's tonight. Been there before in the past and always enjoyed myself. I arrived on time for my reservation. And I told the maitre d that my friends who are with me were running a bit late. Traffic, parking et cetera all the Vegas things. He said okay no problem. when they all get there just let me know. We got there about 20 minutes late maybe 25 minutes late. But I had let him know and he would not seat us that are reserved table, and made us sit in the bar!! I went back to him at the end of the dinner cuz I was so aggravated with the whole situation! His line was something like well I had a c28 reservation so I couldn't Seat you! Now that I've had a chance to think the bit about what he said! It makes no sense. If we were seated at 7:30 at that table he couldn't have conceding someone at our table in 30 minutes! We stayed for two hours we would have been done at 10! If we had arrived on time it would have been 9:30! Either way it would not have been anyone else probably seated at that table.. It was a maitre d with Attitude! Who felt that he had power over us! It's a very expensive restaurant and I felt that we were treated shabbily on his part. The food was good not as good as usual maybe my mood was somewhat altered by his attitude towards us. Anyway lots of restaurants to go to in Las Vegas I know this is a very successful one. Good luck to them!",

I started with the crab cakes; it was a solid good mound of crab meat and it just fell apart in your mouth. It was delicious. For my main course, I decided to go with the bone filet mignon-- amazing. It was about 26 ounces; it wasn't fork tender as it needed to be cooked a bit longer because of the bone shielding the meat from the fire but the flavor was to die for. My partner did have the Chilean sea bass which was also super good. For dessert, we went with the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge and our server gave use a complimentary slice of the Havana pie, which were both amazing. It being my first time, I had dressed with slacks, button up, and a tie, but it was not necessary as you get all sorts of people from the strip in casual clothes coming in. I would definitely come back. I recommend calling ahead for reservations.",

An extensive menu of great foods, a wonderful wine list, and impeccable service are the earmarks of this place. Our server, Danny, was outstanding. He guided us through the endless choices on the menu and all seven of us got exactly what we wanted, (almost).  This is one of those places where you go and you share a little bit off of everyone's plate because it's all so good.  Thoroughly enjoyed both the food and the service.

Recommendation: Definitely call ahead to reserve a main dining room table for dinner. If you arrive early for your reservation take a walk around to look at the nearby shops and stop to have a margarita at La Salsa Cantina before dinner. The drinks here were amazing as well and also a little pricey.",

    "text": "Joe's is exactly what you would expect when you think of fine dining. The service was 10/10. The waiters kept your beverage glass full at all times, the food came ridiculously fast, and every worker was beyond pleasant.   For appetizers we ordered calamari and crab cakes. Both of the appetizers were fantastic! Even the bread basket was delicious! This included various types of bread such as dinner rolls, pretzel bread, and a type of onion bread.   As for the main dish, I ordered the Filet Oscar which consists of a 6 oz Filet Mignon, Asparagus, and Alaskan King Crab Legs. The only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because I was disappointed with the crab legs. On the menu it says Alaskan King Crab \"Legs\" not \"Leg\". It was very disappointing that they only gave one leg, especially since the crab was so appetizing!   We also ordered the stone crab legs. This was my first time trying stone crab legs and I didn't know what to expect. I thought the stone crab legs were pretty good. It was just really different from what I'm used to. It has a bitter kind of taste, I can't exactly pinpoint it.   Another reason why I deducted a star was because on the bill they automatically add 18% for tip. Before we got the bill we were planning to tip more than 18%, but we were kind of disappointed when got the bill. I feel that a person should tip at least 10%, and if the service is excellent then that determines how much more a person should tip.",

The stone crab was pretty darn tasty, the crab cake was so solid with crab that I have no idea how it was held together and the brussels sprouts were some of the best I have tasted. I have nothing to complain about except the high price. Of course it is expected in LasVegas. What did surprise me was the absolutely fantastic service I received. And that's where I felt Joes stood out. So, in the end, my answer is yes. This is worth the price.",

They had plenty of meat I got full before our entree even came. We both had the petite filet Mignon & lobster tail. For sides  we had their mashed potatoes and mushroom Mac and cheese. Honestly we hardly even touched the sides so next time I don't think we will be ordering them. Then we finished off with this really good Havana dream cake.

If you're hungry for steaks in Vegas this is not the place to come, your better off at any of the fine Brazilian Steak houses in Vegas.  My wife had the Cheese Burger. she said she preferred Farmer Boys Cheeseburger instead, so save your $$ and go to In n Out Burger instead.  I ordered the filet and lobster and ended up getting the filet and crab, after I let the waitress know of the incorrect order, she politely said, you ordered the crab. Seriously?  She apologized and went on her duties and a half hour later she  came by to say if she could buy us desert, it was nice of her, but didn't accept.  I'm not coming here no more. Since I 86 myself. I never going back. Its my money and this was another way of getting ripped in Vegas!  Go to The Cheese Cake Factory the other end of this Mall, you will be better off!",

For example, last night my son dropped his fork and the server, Mindy, was right there and grabbed it and handed him another.

There are a handful of other Joe's locations around high dollar cities mostly, and at this location in Vegas, our meal was truly memorable and one that I still daydream about. Our party of high maintenance women on the town demanded service and a fantastic meal and we received both.   We started with the stone crabs (of course) and they were so delicious. Oh. My. Gaw.  A few of us had their lunch salads. Let me just tell you right now, with my left hand upon a stack of Holy Bibles, and my right hand raised in the air, that these were salads like nothing else I had ever experienced. I'm not talking about a side salad. These were the salads as a meal and they were each incredible and overflowing with fresh greens and cold seafood galore! I don't even remember what anybody else had because I was 100% preoccupied with this salad.  The service was impeccable, the atmosphere, an upscale vibe yet welcoming.

We sat \"outside\" so we could people watch and the host was quite entertaining as he interacted with everyone.  Food we ordered:  Crab bisque - on the salty side, but a generous portion and great with the bread assortment. we could have done without it.   Stone crab legs (medium) - 1000x yes! I got the smallest ones due to the lowest price but I didn't have a problem deshelling these and I typically don't eat crab due to that hurdle.   Pork shank - For a turf choice, this was amazing. Fall off the bone tender and the rich red wine sauce was perfect.   Creamed spinach - Salted perfectly and exactly what I wanted it to be. They give a good portion so was probably a heavy choice given the entrees we ordered though.   Key lime pie - Packed with lime flavor! It is really a great way to end the meal, though the sourness did shock me in the first bite. Subsequent bites got better. Even though I was stuffed to the brim, I was able to stomach about half of it, due to the tart light nature.   Service was impeccable. Never had to ask for a water refill! I'm that person who drinks a few cups (or several) during a meal. The waiter was friendly and gave us positive reinforcement after we ordered which left me excited to try the meal and I wasn't let down at all.  Definitely would recommend for a higher end experience in Vegas.",

Began with Seafood platter:  lobster tails, shrimp cerviche, king crab legs, shrimp cocktail: (fresh, and large portions) Ceasar salad: (would not recommend. Almost everyone in our party commented on the lack of quality)   Main course: Ahi tuna filet: (YUM. The fish was cooked correctly, but the sauce it was paired with was divine)   Dessert: Key lime pie (Way too sweet and did not pair well with the rest of the meal IMO. Had one bite, and that was too much.) Espresso: (average, not much to write about).  Other notes: Wasn't impressed with the service once so ever. Waiters didn't really seem like the cared, threw toothpicks into the middle of the table, and other serving issues such as forgetting guests who had not been served. Quite off putting, really.   Stick to the seafood, they do it right.",

It's tucked away at Caesar's so we were a little late.  Stone crabs were amazing, and the mustard sauce was to die for.  I was never a big fan of crab or claw meat in general, but boy were we glad we tried it.  That was my favorite part of the meal.  They were generous with the warm bread basket - 2 for our table of 3 adults and 2 kids.  The 24 oz bone-in ribeye was yummy.  The sole was deboned table side - pretty fancy.  Crab bisque was okay.  Now the downside - all on the service side. -They collected our wine glasses without asking if we wanted any wine after pouring us water. -They told us that they only had the small stone crab claws left.  However, 10 min later I hear the same waiter tell the table next to us that they had small AND jumbo available.  WTF?  Did they get a new shipment in at 8 pm? -Ordered 2 kids meals for our 2 little ones.  They don't tell you about the options for sides until I asked.  They didn't give us the included drinks until we were finishing up and I noticed it on the kid's menu (I had to wave them down to ask for it). -Water was never refilled at our table (but promptly refilled at the table next to us by the guy who took our order).  We had two empty glasses, and I asked for a refill but they didn't remember before we left. -Gave me the check AND took away the signed copy halfway thru our dessert.  The table next to us were Caucasian couples, maybe 40-50 yo, so maybe you'd have better luck if that's your demographic (but no need to dress fancy)?  Wasn't able to decipher the key to better service yet, so I guess no more stone crabs for me until I make it out to Miami.  :(",

I really have nothing but praise for the waiter and servers. The ambiance is very upscale and it's an easy place to have a classy meal.   I had the crab bisque, which was excellent. Nice texture good flavor just the right amount of crab and good presentation. Then I tried their 9oz filet. I think it was cooked perfectly but to be honest was a bit dry. The loaded hash browns thing they make is excellent. Crispy and flavorful with those sauteed onions. The in season roasted corn and sauteed spinach also were top notch. I didn't love their mac and cheese but then again I'm not a huge Mac and cheese fan. The Havana dream pie was very well done. Sort of like a tres leches pie. Overall I'd definetly go back but might try their crab or lobster as the steaks are nothing to write home about.",

But whether you want to wear a cocktail dress/suit or jeans and t-shirt it doesn't matter, it has a very come as you are vibe. Very pleased with our experience! We would definitely recommend this place to our friends.",

    "text": "I have generally enjoyed Joe's and told my nieces and nephews, and their escorts, that Joe's is my favorite restaurant in Vegas.  That changed this last Saturday.    I was a guest of my sister and her husband, as this was their youngest daughter's 21st birthday.  We had a party of 12, my sister having made the reservation 2 month's previously.  The place was very busy but we were 45 minutes early.  No place to wait or sit as the bar seating is on their \"wait list.\"  Our entire party was present when my sister checked in with the host.    Another man, who was there before us, was waiting for his party (all men).  Apparently, their table was also for 12 and the other 11 showed up after us.  They were seated first, almost immediately, at a much roomier table.  We barely had room for our group and my sister was not happy.  Her husband was at a corner that was clearly not meant to hold dinner service, but we made due, especially as we did not want to ruin our niece's special evening.    My sister believes that our table was given to the men.  I think she is right.  Our primary server (a woman), was outstanding. She was efficient, funny, and once I made clear I was not the host (I said, when addressed as though I was making the decisions, perhaps because I was wearing a jacket?, \"I am sitting between two powerful women, my wife and my sister, and my sister is hostess for this party), she addressed questions to my sister.  Sadly, the server's backup help did not meet even basic courtesy.  One very tall man acted as though he could not hear my sister when she addressed him, but seemed capable of hearing me?!?  In general, he just came across as rude and very condescending to women.  REALLY?!?  What year is this?  The food was very good, and we ran up a decent tab. While I enjoyed the evening, Joe's has too much competition in LV to treat people this way.  I considered ordering a bottle of a vintage champagne to toast my niece.  I decided against it when I saw how my sister was treated.  Last summer, a larger party (most of the same people) that I hosted at Del Frisco's, was treated like royalty.  We visit LV multiple times each year and have 12 to 15 in our group.  We reserve early as we know how full restaurants can be.  In this case, Joe's disappointed deeply.  We can certainly choose to dine elsewhere.  Perhaps, that is the message we were supposed to receive?  If so, received and understood.  We can spend our thousands in other establishments that understand both customer service and common courtesy.",

    "text": "My husband and I were at Joe's on a Sunday night, 7pm reservations. Because I enjoyed the experience so much, I did a repeat there for a solo lunch a couple of days later.   Sunday, dinner: sat in the back dining area and loved the atmosphere. I've been to a couple of swank steak places and this one did not disappoint. Lots of wood and dim lighting. The atmosphere and the service were on point. Classy, but not pretentious.   Apps: I had a shrimp cocktail and my hubby had raw oysters. The shrimp cocktail was great, big fresh prawns and a good bite of horseradish in the cocktail sauce, loved it. My hubby said the oysters were okay, fresh just 2 of the 3 did not work for him.   Cocktails/wine: I had my standard - a lemon drop martini. Excellent. My husband had a couple of glasses of wine, he can't remember the type, but he liked it well enough to have 2 glasses!   Bread basket: As fellow yelpers have noted, bread was yummy. Several varieties along with chilled butter. Pretzel bread, extra yum.   Mains: Stone crab, I ordered the small plate of stone crab claws for my main and hubby ordered the mixed seafood grill.   The crab claws tasted really good, fresh and sweet meat. But, as someone else noted, it can be difficult to avoid little pieces of shell. They arrived at the table all cracked and ready to be eaten, but seems they can be a little like shelling a hard boiled egg - at times it can be difficult to remove tiny pieces of shell. But, overall, glad to have them. Wanted to try the stone crab claws as it's a speciality for them.   Mixed seafood grill: Tasted this and can report that the garlic butter seasoning on the seafood was great and it had a nice grilled flavor. Only complaint was that a couple of the smaller shrimp were a little over cooked.   Solo lunch, Wed around 1pm: no reservations. Although I waited an extended amount to be seated, they were not that busy. The wait staff apologized when he arrived...ok. But, once I was seated, everything was timely. Sat in the front area near the bar and enjoyed that setting as well.   Had the whale for 1 as an entree. It was my favorite. One big prawn, crab leg, 1/2 a lobster tail and a flavorful shrimp, scallop ceviche. $28 for the market price, still wonderful. Had drawn butter and an lemon drop martini (if it anit broke, don't fix it...) on the side. Oh, my, loved it.   Joe's, highly recommend and will add to my \"must do\" Las Vegas list!",

Our dishes were phenomenal and we both agreed that when we visit Vegas again we will absolutely make a reservation again. Thank you for the amazing service, atmosphere and food.

    "text": "The legendary restaurant known for its stone crabs from Florida!  I've had this place bookmarked forever so we finally went and the Vegas location is tucked away inside of Caesars Palace. I would imagine that the Miami location has to be even better...  So our waiter was charming and attentive and he was really part of the overall experience. Super impressed!   Complimentary champagne flutes were sent over as we were celebrating which I'm always grateful for when restaurants make these special touches happen. To the food...  The bread basket was disappointing. Nothing was warm and the bread tasted like it sat around for too long.   The massive grilled Madagascar shrimp that came with a key lime aioli were great. My stone crabs were juicy & sweet and my man enjoyed his filet. We also order their seasonal corn which was phenomenal and the lyonnaise potatoes that are basically a large pile of hash browns with caramelized onions! So decadent!  Had to also try their famous key lime pie and it was worth the calories.",

I had the bone-in filet mignon , my friends had the bison steak and the bone-in rib eye . Medium rare all around! And yes, yes you must do the stone crabs!!!! Now at $50 a plate for just 6... you might hesitate... but honestly. We ended up ordering 2 plates! They're that good. So just, treat yo' self!",

Nicely charbroiled and the server cut the head off. You pay per shrimp. I would order 3-4 along with a salad and be content. My wife ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. It was four jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab meat. I ordered the filet Mignon with the Lobster Tail. The filet was juicy and tender. It melted in my mouth. The server brought some extra seasoning that was similar to Montreal Steak Seasoning. I did not really need it on the steak but used it on the asparagus Spears. The server removed the tail from the shell. The lobster meat was sweet and succulent. We ordered some Lyonnaise potatoes that were phenomenal. They were nicely browned and had carameluzed onions on top! I wanted to take the leftovers but since we were going to a concert could not take them. I will definitely come back when I return to Vegas. All of the servers were excellent.",

A nice bread basket selection was served, quickly followed by the apps of Madagascar shrimp and seafood ceviche.  Both were excellent.  The portions are fairly large and are served ala carte.  We ordered the seafood chopped salad(fresh and well balanced flavors), grilled seafood platter (just yummy), crispy brussels sprouts (omg crispy, sweet and probably the best I've ever eaten) and Lyonnaise potatoes(tasty, tasty).  Every one of them was fantastic.  Although stuffed we were tempted by the dessert selections, which seems to be happening a lot lately.  We shared key lime pie and banana cream pie, once again both were delicious.   We will definitely be back when in town again!",

    "text": "Disappointed with the food choices and quality at The Mirage where we were staying, we walked three minutes next door to the forum shops at Caesars Palace.   Joe's looked busy for a 3:30pm Thursday which is a good sign.    What a treat.  First class perfect service from Bridgette, with her knowledgeable and easy going review of what's on offer.    We had never tried stone crab but hey it's what they're known for and you can order by the claw.  We chose two each as a starter.  They are just superb, the mustardy dip adds to the experience.    Crab Louis salad and a filet mignon with lobster tail were well presented, perfectly seasoned and executed.    We sat \"outside\" with a view of the folks exploring the Forum and everything was just enjoyable.   Again, thanks to Bridgette for being a total professional.    Eat here.  Enjoy. And, you are welcome.",

I might have eaten steak as good but I've never eaten steak that was Better and the king crab legs hands down were the BEST I've ever had by far. Only thing better then the food was the service. Andrew our waiter was outstanding. He was never at the table it seemed so we could visit and enjoy our meal. It was like he had ESP. Everytime I even thought about needing something I would turn around and he was there  most the time with what I was wanting Amazing. . I won't go to another steak house in Vagas ever again. Found the best one in my opinion in Joe's. . I would Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a Great place to eat.",

    "text": "This review is for an event in the private room upstairs.  The servers were overall very attentive and friendly. The food was excellent quality and quantity. Our mea began with The Whale served family style. This was comprised of Alaskan king crab, Lobster tail, Jumbo shrimp cocktail, and shrimp & scallop ceviche. The only awkward aspect was the lack of spoons to serve the cocktail sauce and ceviche onto one's plate. The quality of the seafood was outstanding, though :) The servers also came around with small silver carafes (like a little coffee pot) filled with melted butter to pour into little dishes at your place!  Next came two truly delicious salads. The Caesar salad was to die for delicious. But sadly there was not enough of it to go around our table. We also had a chopped vegetable salad very lightly dressed with a creamy vinaigrette. This salad was so delicious, too! It was mostly chopped veggies like green beans, jicama, carrot, cabbage, etc. The flavors and textures were perfect!  For the entree each guest had a choice of: Herb Roasted Chicken (did ANYONE actually order this???) Colossal Lump Crab Cakes (looked A-Mazing!!) Salmon Au Poivre - orange, fennel & radish Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon (This was the thickest tuna steak I have ever seen!) - crispy potato cake, spinach, mushroom, & red wine bordelaise. Chilean Sea Bass - miso glaze, bok choy & shiitake mushrooms. Petite Filet Mignon- 8 oz.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass and although the bok choy and mushrooms were seriously lacking, the fish (which is the star) was terrific! It was a generously sized portion, not over seasoned, nor over cooked. It was a treat!   ::vegetarian and gluten free options were also available::  Sides served family style were: Jenny's Mashed Potatoes Four Cheese Mac & Cheese (There were three dishes each of these per table of 9, so there was plenty!!)  I skipped the Mac & Cheese due to the heavy dairy, so I can't rate it. The potatoes, however, were delicious. They did have a crumb topping on them, though. Something a person avoiding gluten would never expect. You've been warned ;)  The desserts were really just okay. A tray was brought out with small petite-four sized pieces of Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Fudge Pie, and Havana Dream Pie. I expected to have a dessert that would inhabit my dreams upon tasting the Havana Dream Pie, but it didn't. It lacked interest for me. It seamed like a sponge cake sliced with a pastry cream filling. Ordinary? Maybe I need to try it again to be sure.  The Key Lime was well executed, tart, not too sweet, velvety creamy texture. I did not opt for the chocolate as I did not want to over indulge in the sweets, either ;)   Overall, I can say the banquet menu and service was excellent. I would happily return for either a private event or a personal dining experience.",

    "text": "I either have a poor sense of direction or this place was really difficult to find. Just in case you are also having trouble finding it, begin entering the Forum shops from the registration lobby and then turn right until you reach the escalators leading down to Las Vegas Blvd. The restaurant is located there.   The appetizers and sides were tasty and filling. The Tuna Tartar was the favorite among the group. It was fresh and you could also add the tuna on top of the chip for that fresh crunchy texture. I had the Chilean Sea Bass dish and I liked it. It was tender and flavorful with the miso glaze. However, I did find myself comparing it to the Season 52's Chilean Sea Bass dish from their 2016 Spring menu and thought that their dish was slightly better than this one.   Note that an automatic 18% gratuity is added to the bill. My group and I were surprised, but were fine with it since we enjoyed our food and our server was energetic and helpful.",

Then, We always start with an order of the stone crabs (JUMBO if we're lucky enough). For our meals my husband gets the king crab which is the best in the city. Legs come out HUGE and they cut it open right in front of you all you have to do is peel it out of shell and enjoy! I usually choose between the Chilean Sea Bass or a nice steak. The sea bass has a nice miso glaze on top and just melts in your mouth. The steak is prime meat cooked to perfection with a side of seasoning! Then of course we end the night with a nice piece of pie! I've tried about all of them but I have to say my fav is the Havana which is similar to an angel cake with a creamy center and goes perfectly with a cappuccino. If you have the opportunity make sure you experience Joe's!",

    "text": "This is my goto spot!  It doesnt matter what you order it will be good.  Crab bisque is always a good start and the steaks are always cooked on point. I like to have them slice the meat so the table can share some cuts and also try other items on the menu. One of which is their fried chicken!   I think this chicken is one of the best ive had and better than a lot of places that supposedly  \"specialize \" in fried chicken.  I always go with the in season side dishes and if they have it, the grilled corn is a must!  The pies are WHOA! Hands down the best key lime pie and if that is not your style go with the Havana cream. I promise you will not be disappointed.  My friends and i compair every other restaurant to joes. Doesnt matter if its pizza or chinese if the quality isnt there we say \"it aint no joes\". Joes IS the standard and its a high one which they always meet.  There are a lot of steak options in this town. Joes is not only one of the best but has great options outside of steak.",

    "text": "Having walked by Joe's many times in the past six years and intrigued by the camaderie of the restaurant, I finally decided to make a reservation here for my pop's birthday dinner. After having our dinner here, I have decided Joe's is actually a 3-star restaurant hidden behind their parade of waiters in suits and their famous Stone Crab.   In a city bustling with celebrity chef restaurants, Joe's fails to scratch at the surface of the upper echelon that consists of places like SW Steakhouse or Joel Robuchon. There's no single bad element that defines Joe's, but it was a combination of little miscues that diminished my experience here.   1) mac & cheese was too runny for my liking. I thought gourmet mac & cheese would have more texture, but this side dish was slathered in Kraft-like liquid cheese.  2) Most upscale joints have their waiters/assistants scrap off bread crumbs off the white tablecloth onto a pan. Details like that are supposed to enhance your fine-dining experience. But this particular evening, the assistant to our waiter just scraped the breadcrumbs onto the ground. I felt that small detail made my dinner less-than-memorable.   3) The complimentary bread was less than stellar. I have had better bread at lower $$ establishments. I liked that there was variety to the bread basket, but some of the choices tasted stale.   Pops and I both ordered the steak & lobster dinner. Dinner tasted delicious, but it fails to distinguish itself from previous steak and seafood joints I have eaten at. Is Joe's worth visiting once in your lifetime? Yes, it has some good qualities. The mashed potatoes were very good and I enjoyed the custom-inked cloth napkins in the upstairs restroom. I just don't find myself rushing back here anytime soon.",

The waiter never asked if it was cooked correctly, and he didn't check on us for a while so we just ate it.  All crab legs are served on ice. I wish I would have known before I ordered because I like warm crab legs. It was gross. The key lime pie was still frozen in parts. No offer to refill my tea and the waiter almost looked annoyed when I asked for a refill. The bread was cold and the roll hard. The calamari was good and the hash browns were terrific.  Other than that, it was just ok. Definitely not worth the $250 we paid. We will not be back.  I'm guessing people who think this food is amazing haven't had great steak and seafood before...or service for that matter.",

Makes me dance, brings me up, brings me down, plays it sweet Makes me move like a freak at...JOE'S SEAFOOD! - Alexandra Stan (mr. saxobeat)  Maybe I didn't get enough sleep the night before, maybe it was the wait on the runway flying here that seemed like an eternity, maybe it was the taxi driver that took a super long route to get to our hotel, or maybe the stone crabs just didn't live up to expectations.   The main reason I chose to dine here over other steakhouses for the night (also because Tom Colicchio's new Heritage Steakhouse at the Mirage, which was supposed to open in July, hasn't yet --- August 19th straight from his twitter *crossing fingers*) was for the STONE CRABS. Look at the pictures, they look soooo gooood. I called them earlier in the day and they said I had em, in which case I was excited to try these bad boys. It was fortunate I made reservations in advance, this place was packed.   When it came time to order, we asked about the infamous stone crabs and were told that they were frozen and she suggested another type of crab legs. The fact that she recommended something else made me a little hesitant but if we came here for the stone crabs, we're gonna get em no matter what. Turned out to be a bit of a mistake, as they were served noticeably thawed and while they were easy to peel, they lacked the WOW factor I was hoping for. I was told before I ordered them that they weren't in season right now and I understood the risk, so i take full responsibility for us not having the best first stone crab experience. I kinda wish I knew when I called in earlier though that they were frozen...oh wells.  I ordered the salmon, which was okay and nothing special. The steak looked really good and the house sea salt mixture that they brought with it was supposedly 'game changing.' Unfortunately, I was just too tired from everything that happened earlier that day that I wasn't in the mood for steak and didn't get to try it. We ordered some sides as well but I don't remember what they were LOL (i do remember sweet corn...that was good) Almost forgot but the lobster salad was very fresh and was big enough to share.  The restaurant itself is nicely lit and was very busy, even as we were leaving. I might come back another day when the stone crabs are in season and I'll order the steak, as it seemed to be well prepared. For now, I am earnestly waiting to try Heritage steakhouse when I head back in September.",

    "text": "I don't think I can eat another Alaskan King Crab Leg unless it is on par with Joe's quality. Seriously, my husband and I had dinner here 2 weeks ago and we are STILL talking about the amazing crab meat.   My husband started with the Crab Bisque and it was the best Crab Bisque we have ever had.  There were beautiful chunks of crab nestled at the bottom of the bowl as our waiter poured the rich and decadent soup over it.  I started with a half dozen of Oysters on the had shell and it tasted fresh and perfectly briny with a clean finish.   We also shared the Chopped Salad. It's not your average chopped salad- it is packed full of a variety of fresh veggies and topped with a delicious vinaigrette.  I could have eaten these starters alone and be happy with my meal.    But, then the jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs came to the table.  It was beautiful. It was a bit pricey at $79 but my husband and I were practically moaning after every sweet bite.  And it was huge and so much crab meat. So. Much. I don't think every strip  buffet's crab legs combined can even match the amount that was in the crab we were served.  It was first presented on a beautiful platter and then perfectly cracked open by our server, leaving us perfect thick sweet whole portions of crab meat.  Dip it in some warm clarified butter and you will be speechless.  Speech. Less.   We also ordered the last order of the \"Select\" Stone Crabs.  Just because it is in its name, doesn't necessarily mean they will have stone crabs available.  I guess this year's catch has been historically low so we were lucky to get the last batch.  There are also Medium and Large Stone Crabs offered.  The \"Select: is the size in between.  These are my husband's favorite. Personally, I thought they were OK.  It has a much more mild flavor.  I'll take the Alaskan King Crab over them any day.   We then finished our meal with the famous Key Lime Pie.  Key Lime Pie is usually the last thing I would consider when I have other pies to choose from, but since this is something they are known for- we had to try it.  And I am so glad we did- it was delicious! It is so popular that you can find the recipe on line- or better yet you can order it from the original Miami, FL location and have it shipped to right to you.    We were extremely happy with our meal from start to finish.  The service was attentive and friendly.  Although the waiters are formally dressed in their black and whites, it is such a comfortable atmosphere while still classy.  Now excuse me, as I reminisce about those decadently delicious crab legs and save my pennies so I can return.  Because it is worth it.  Oh so worth it!  *Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 55/100*",

Always perfectly cooked and nice flavor.  Not to mention a quality cut of beef!  The only thing I do have to complain about is the portion size of the sides - they're HUGE!! I know I shouldn't be complaining, but we had so much left over that we left behind was disappointing.  I had totally forgotten to tell my friends that we'd share the sides and we regretfully over bought. I'm hoping they give all that extra food to the homeless.  They really should make a notation that the sides are large on their menu and are meant for sharing.  Add this to itinerary, I promise you'll have a great meal!",

They have many other delicious entrees but one advice, don't skip on the stone crab! This is my must stop every time I go to Vegas :)",

The sides were the corn with cilantro and lemon on the side (very delicious) The potatoes weren't to my taste but luckily I was really full so didn't eat them I had lemon cake - delicious!  Service was FIRST CLASS. My baby is 1 and can't sit in place and the greeter at the front ended up playing with him! I really had a great time  The bread selection with butter was fabulous as well. I was visiting Vegas and I must say I had a great time here.  Come here during lunch, the menu is less pricey and the meals are just as great. Portions were awesome. Location was beautiful inside The Shoppe",

When I called the restaurant to see if we could get in sooner they were more than willing to accommodate. Score!! I got the filet and crab and it was absolutely delicious. The quality of the filet was top notch, and the crab was melt in your mouth perfection. My husband also got the filet but with the Lobster tail, and it was amazing as well!! Huge portion of lobster for the price. We had the baked Mac and cheese as our side. It was huge portion with a Gouda mix of cheeses. To die for!! We were impressed!! We finished it off with the \"Strawberry pie\", which was worth the 5lbs I probably gained eating it. Don't let the name deceive you though. It was an Oreo cookie crust stuffed with Haagen-Daz strawberry ice cream drizzled with a marshmallow sauce. Too delicious!! Our server was fantastic as well. An older blonde lady, I really wish I would have gotten her name......She was just so down to earth, knowledgeable, and really made us feel at home in this amazing restaurant. We will definitely be back!! Thank you Joes for making our anniversary dinner AMAZING!!!",

Between the 4 of us we ordered filet mignon, lobster, Caesar salad, and fish n chips. As far as sides you have to try the mac n cheese. TO DIE FOR!! All together, including 2 rounds of beer, our bill was about $250.   Now I am not usually one to spend too much money on food but Joe's was worth every penny. Everything from classy ambiance to excellent service to great tasting food. The warm chocolate cake a la mode that came out as a birthday surprise didn't hurt either ;)",

The deep fried asparagus was crunchy and tender, the grilled corn is also a must.  They had a lobster mac and cheese, but just recently took it off the menu!  Big sad face!

We were a party of 3 and were sat in a very high traffic area. Our seats were continually bumped by the servers and clients walking by.  As for the food, our server was in denial when I questioned whether the steak was prime. The steak (rib-eye on the bone) was chewy and somewhat tough. Prime meat that I have eaten is soft, so I questioned the grade of meat.  Also, when I asked the server for extra butter, his reaction was as if I had just insulted him. I eventually had to ask a bus-boy for the butter.  Service was rushed and sub-par for this restaurant. My impression was that this is a mediocre restaurant with high-end prices.  Very disappointed.",

When the steakhouse is that expensive, everything else is pricy too.  The total cost of one meal would be close to $150 per person at those places.  The quality is also good but nothing spectacular.  Joe's steaks, filet mignon, lamb chops, glazed cod, etc. are all excellent!  The prices are reasonable.  The sides are great.  The stone crabs are delicious as well.  The atmosphere is nice too.  For a lighter meal, try their salads ----soooo good.  To sum it up...  Everything at Joe's is quality and delicious.  You can try a bunch of entrees (steak, crab, lamb, cod) and sides (lobster bisque, salads, cream corn, jeanies potatoes) with a party of 5 and only pay $50 per person.    The other high end food places will cost you $150 but you only get a small cut of steak and 1 side.  Joe's still my favorite in Vegas",

Went out to dinner with my G.F. for our \"nice\" dinner out on vacation and we read so many good reviews of this place, so we had to go. All the good reviews do not lie, this place is amazing. We started with the 5 large stone crabs as an appetizer and were very very good. The mustard dipping sauce that comes with it works very will with the crab, but dont overdue it. Your ordering a $65 appetizer so enjoy the crab, not the sauce. I would have loved to see how big the two colossal stone crabs were that cost $85.  For the main meal, we had the 12 oz. filet mignon and the 16 oz NY strip. Probably the best steak Ive ever had. It was cooked absolutely perfect and the steak was like butter. Amazing!! For the sides, we split a half order of the mashed potatoes and the roasted corn. Both were excellent!   This was the first time Ive been to this restaurant, but it is now our spot when we are in Vegas. Dont get all hyped up on going to the \"big chef name\" restaurants, when you want an amazing meal, this is the place to go. The reviews are correct, this place does not disappoint at all.",

What a relief.  We dined here on Sunday night and it was so freaking good!  We had:  -large stone crab appetizer -                     so sweet and meaty. pure perfection. -oysters on a half shell -                     very fresh and the perfect size. -21 oz. bone in rib-eye -                     so tender and flavorful. so perfect for sharing!  -garlic creamed spinach -                     oh so creamy and topped with roasted garlic cloves. yum! -rice pilaf -                     good but i should have gone for the sweet corn -chocolate mousse pie -                     so yummy  The service was super attentive.  The OMG moment of the night was after we finished our appetizers Patrick (our server) asked us to hold out our hands, squeezed lemon over our them and then hands us two hot towels.  Whoa.  Now that's service!  I can't wait to go back.  Everything was perfect.  Service, seating and food.  What more could you ask for?",

I was very happy that we chose Joe's! The sevice was excellent! My husband and I split the ribeye and we had the crab legs (only happens 4 weeks out of the year so why not?!). The ribeye was good, but it wasn't the best. The crab legs were by far the best I've ever had in my life. AMAZING! Sides were good too. We had the mac & cheese (was just the right amount of creamy- I find restaurants make it too dry for my tastes, but I love it!), mashed potatoes (YUM), and the brussels (eh). All in all, I was VERY pleased with my experience. Wouldn't say it was the best, but would say it was pretty darned good. Overall, I'd give it a 8.5/9.",

Yes they are expensive, but absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. They redefine what crab should taste like and you should not leave here without trying them. I split a caesar salad and an order of the legs with my mom and it was more than enough food. I will be back for the legs!",

    "text": "The Skinny : come for lunch as the prices are much more reasonable - get the 2 course lunch for a great deal.  The turkey avocado sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  Stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)  Just to preface this review -  Stone crab is not all that for me. Neither is crab in general. But we still make our way to Joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items.   We usually go during the summer when Lettuce Entertain You club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. Usually there is a coupon for Joe's which is a major score (yay!).   We've tried different iterations of things but the True stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner.   My perennial favorite is their turkey avocado sandwich. Served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. Love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. The fried sweet potato fries are pretty solid but nothing special. For $16, this is as affordable for a place like Joe's gets.   The hubs loves their sliced rib eye French dip with sauteed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) It's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. The french fries again are nothing special.   The two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. Between the two options of Alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  I would opt for the crab.   Really,  the crab is only okay in my books. Portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. Where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. The lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. Greasy but very tasty. The roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. Both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. It comes with Havana dream pie which is essential a Boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. If you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. All of this for around $28-29.  The steak option is okay - just the mashed potatoes are boring while the sauteed spinach is nothing special.   Service is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. As soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. The bread basket is okay but I find myself partial to the Parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.  Overall, Joe's is nothing particularly innovative. But it is good food executed well generally. Value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.",

First of all... the decor reminds me of where all the top dog mobsters would dine & plan their riches... ahahaha there is a host in a raised podium area that greets you & takes down your name & calls your name through speaker when your table is ready.   Hubby & I luckily got invited to dine here for my lovely YAYA's 50th birthday party!! We started off at the bar while we waited for our reservations & got to see gorgeously rimmed martinis & cocktails being made.   We were placed inna private room since we had a party of 14 & I think one of the guests were also a frequent diner. I wish I heard the server's name but there was so much going on w/ people talking that I don't recall his name =[ but whoever you are... you know who you are & you were FREAKEN AWESOME!! o8.26.15 was the date so to managent give this server props! One of the guests said he wanted fruit loops cereal as a joke & this guy pops up out of NO WHERE!! w/ a box of mini fruit loops cereal & says \" your dinner is served sir\" OMG OMG way to give the birthday girl the best laugh & wonderment of her life   LARGE STONE CRAB $M/P - We got one claw each as an appetizer & my yaya & I also shared the large order for our main as well. These were served cold which I am definitely usually not a big fan of... but man!! These claws just were so freakishly DERICIOUS I just could stop stuffing my face!   BLT WEDGE SALAD $15.95 - This salad was simple yet so good & refreshing   BONE-IN RIB EYE $59.95 - rib eye just has the most flavor. HUGE 24 oz. Bone-in rib eye is the way to go w/ the most flavor packed juiciness!! The steak was cooked to perfection  ROASTED SWEET CORN $9.95 - this side is the most ADDDICTING thing I have put in my mouth & just had to keep having more & more even though I was stuffed   BAKED POTATO $8.95 - topped w/ roasted onions & some sour cream on the side. It literally did not look like your average baked potato... it was crispy & soft all at the same time. The roasted onions also gave it a hint of sweetness.  BREAD - complimentary bread was served at the beginning & my favorite one was the roasted onion bread!! I ate 3 loaves... also came w/ pretzel bun, plain dinner roll, slice of some kind of raisain bread?, & cheese crisp flat bread....  CHOCOLATE CAKE - the birthday cake once cut was served w/ a cute little scoop of vanilla ice cream & I ate two!! Ugh... the most MOIST cake you will put in your mouth & just thinking about it make me drool!  Everything was served a la carte. I dream about the sweet corn & the stone claws... so I will be back to claw this place down!",

We had sate mushroom and shrimps for appetizers. Salmon, ahi tuna, fillet mignon, and crab cakes for main dishes. They are all great.  For desert, we had lime cake, chocolate cake and apple pie. To my surprise, even though the pie looks quite homemade but is so tasty and to die for!  I have has their crabs at their OG Joe's in Miami so... no question, crab is their specialty!  However, our servers were very rude and scolded at everyone when we asked for drinks (diet coke instead of regular coke, tea in stead of coffee, really?!) and when some people wanted to use their same utensils in stead of changing new utensils! The food were dropped in front of you...  So, even the crabs are awesome, I would be afraid to come back to this place... Who needs to be schooled about utensils, eating too much bread before your meals or whatever...  There are so many other great restaurants in Caesar Palace alone and on the strip...!",

For a lot more money than the 8 oz filet I tried the other day, it's definitely not better.  I would go back but order the filet and NOT the bone-in one.  Service was better than what I had the other day.  I'm knocking it down because of the steak.",

Party of 5, there were no tables available and we didn't have a reservation, but as luck would have it... there were 5 seats at the bar.  Bonus here is that the complimentary water they provide with your meal is bottled Fiji!  Awesome Sauce!  The complimentary bread basket includes a variety of bread: pretzel, roll, cornbread and a cheddar/jalepeno flat.  The cornbread was a hit, so much so that my friend requested a refill of only cornbread, which was provided without issue.  They serve their butter at room temp, which makes for easier spreading. With so many great options on the menu, I settled on the Crab Stuffed Shrimp and Lyonnaise Potatoes as the side.  Each bite was savory and decadent.  The crab mixture was 90% crab meat 10% filler, you really got great crab taste which each bite.  The lyonnaise potatoes were crispy, not burned and the carmelized onions served on top added great flavor.  At this end of this meal, I leaned back in the seat and smiled, you will too.",

The steak was juicy and flavorful, especially with the sea salt they provide. Unfortunately, our Porterhouse lacked consistency; some of it edged towards well-done. All in all, I felt that I could've gotten this level of steak for half the price. Dad did say it was much better the last time- maybe it was a different chef this time? I'll have to come back another time.",

This is the first time I have had stone crab claw but its definitely different in meat texture and flavor than other crab claws. They crack the shell up pretty good and you just have to peel away the shell and eat. The waitress said to just eat it like you would a hard boiled egg.  Apparently, the fishermen catch these crabs, cut off one of the claws, and then throw them back. The claws grow back and then they later get caught again.  I do recommend starting off the with some stone crab claws.  For my entree, I had the petite filet mignon and jumbo Alaskan king crab legs. These were both very good...can't really go wrong with these.  The creamed spinach was just okay....the pan roasted sweet corn was delicious.",

It was beautiful and buttery and delicious.  We also had one of the suggested dinners with the large stone crab claws, creamed spinach, and some kind of potatoes I think.  WIth the tasty pumpernickel raisin bread (and others), giant lobster, crab claws, and the obligatory slice of their award-winning key lime pie, we were stuffed to the brim! (Sorry sides.)    On past visits we've also had steak (well executed), the fried oysters (super delish!) and lobster bisque (also delish, but they didn't have it this last time).    As their name implies, you seriously can't come here without getting yourself some sweet, meaty stone crab claws with the sweet mustardy sauce that they have perfected!!!  We settle for Truluck's all you can eat stone crab on Mondays sometimes when we have a real hankering, but no one does it like Joe.",

Everything else was decent, but not great.  If everything was as good as the sea bass, I would give five stars.  The service was good.

    "text": "Funny. When I tell out of town people about this place, they all think it's \"Joe's Crab Shack\"..   Funnier - The foodie snobs who think they're \"in the know\" that thumb their noses thinking it IS Joe's Crab Shack, drowning in their pretentiousness, who have yet to experience this place by taste or camera phone.   Make no mistake folks, this is NOT them!  I've probably dined here at least 4 times a month for 3 years straight, mostly tending to  out of town clients coming in for a conference or a little R&R. The location is great simply because it's in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, which is on Flamingo, conveniently located halfway to everything on the strip. Lots of people watching, distractions, shopping, etc, just feet away. Valet is right in front of the restaurant, which is also another plus. Make sure to arrive and exit the back way onto Frank Sinatra drive, behind the casino, otherwise you will face the cluster F*** that is the main 4 way stop into the casino from the strip. There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to this 4 way, as it is not optimally shaped, lacks signs or signals, and funnels you right into the main casino valet, taxi line, pedestrian lines, etc. No one really knows what they are in for going through this thing. You will inevitably play chicken with your vehicle. If you have a sick sense of humor,  you might get a kick out of watching the action and riot level tempers erupt up during peak weekend hours in and around this bastard...if you're into that sort of thing...haha..  So the rib eye is pretty spot on and on par with most fare of this caliber on the strip. But the real headliner (literally) is the Stone crab, hence the name of the restaurant... Orders come in 3 sizes, small, medium and large, and I usually order one plate of each size. Believe me it sounds like alot, but it really isn't. You might get 3-4 legs depending on the size of the plate you order. You will devour these things, and when you've just begun to exhale, they will be gone. Everything you love about the sea is well represented....cold, succulent, briny, smooth and slippery textures...wash it down with a nicely chilled grey goose martini and it's either the start or end (depending on the company you keep) of a great evening. And if there is such a thing as \"food porn\" this might qualify as \"food foreplay\"..It's tough to put into words how delicious these thing are. I've had clients, after taking them to this place, call me mid day asking me the name of it, just to tell a friend of a friend to go there, so they can be \"that guy\" and reap bragging rights the next day..good food is truly unforgettable.",

If you were like me and had never even heard of stone crab before, then you have to come here. If you're a little more budget-conscious (if such a thing exists in Vegas) go for lunch because they are usually running great lunch specials where you can get stone crab, they're melt-in-your-mouth potatoes, a side of tomato and a dessert for a very reasonable price. If you want to splurge, check it out for dinner. Both times it has a great swanky yet casual vibe. But for either one...be sure to make a reservation.  I've been going for about 3 years now and it's always been the same host standing at the front podium. He even recognizes my mom and I when we come. The waitstaff has been the same for a long time too which is nice when you come back to a place annually and you see the same friendly faces.  I recommend the large stone crab (it's a bit of an effort to eat I warn you). But once you get inside those shells, the buttery deliciousness that awaits will make it all worthwhile. Order any one of their many kinds of mashed potatoes...there's nothing like them. And for dessert, everything is good but the key lime pie...WOW! It's the perfect refreshing finisher on a hot summer Vegas day too.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm getting in my car to take off for Vegas as I just made myself desperately starving for some Joe's Stone Crab!",

When the bread basket is good- the rest will follow! Usually if they can't serve decent bread- then you can't expect much from there. My husband ordered the Manhattan clam chowder and Seafood salad- full of yummy seafood.  I ordered the petite filet mignon, mashed potatoes, grilled tomato with pesto- yes, I was starving! The food was excellent- my steak was perfectly cooked- medium rare. Then the dessert came- banana cream pie and the waitress surprised us with a birthday brownie with a big scoop of ice cream. What a treat it is to go to Joe's. We are going to make sure we come back again! Plus as a added tip-valet parking is right by their door- easy, no fuss, without trekking through the casino or shops.",

The seafood was sub par at best, I found that I have had much better crab out east. The service was average, I think our waiter filled up our water glass twice and was much busier with his other tables.  I dined here with my Mother and Wife and they felt the same way. They spent some money on the place because the decor was nice. This is a major tourist trap though. They need to do a better job with the food!  I won't make a return trip to Joes :(",

    "text": "The first time we walked up we all thought it was this simple bar and grill place.  We made reservation thru our concierge @ Vdara. When we get there we tell the host that we have reservation and they escort us to the back, behind the curtain and BAM!! We get hit with the elite and fancy side of Joe's. Wow, fancy shemancy... Love it.  So we sit down wit at least 3 -4 server per table and one took our orders.  We had to try the stone crabs of course and the 20 oz rib eyes. We also order some lobster bisque... oh man I only ordered a cup of this stuff but I could've eaten a gallon of it. So rich and flavorful each bite had tons of lobster meat..yumm-mo!! The stone crabs came out next and we each got 2....pretty damn expensive but it was a great piece of claw. Super fresh and amazingly easy to get every single piece of meat.  Not sure if I would get this again since it was about $47 for 2 claws.... =P  Either way once in a lifetime type of deal for all of us.   Our main entrees came next...I ordered the 20 oz rib eye medium well and my wife ordered the veal.  Oh man the rib eye was huge!! Didn't have to put much effort in cutting that bad boy.  The taste was perfect no A1 or sauce or anything.  Loved it My wife's veal was super tender and tasted great. The veal was breaded and had a great flavor and crunchiness to it.  Our friend got the pound of Alaskan crab legs.. oh man those were great.. I wish they had that and a small side of rib eye.  Hint hint!! They even cut open every single crab leg.  Fancchee!!  We also ordered our sides, creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted corn.  All were fantastic..We found out if you mix all three it creates complete happiness in your mouth. Hahaha   Although we were stuffed I wanted to order some dessert for everyone.  So we shared some banana foster cake and some chiffon type cake. Both were so good and ended our night perfectly.  Great way to end our Vegas trip!!   For all 7 of us the bill was only $600ish.. So not bad.  Great service and great food! Must try guys!!",

Don't get me wrong, they're actually really sweet, succulent, and quite tasty w/ the Dijonnaise they give you, but I guess I never understood the appeal of cold seafood.  I need my crab with onion and ginger or salt and pepper.  Must be a white thing.  :) I did feel compelled to quickbuy some Hall & Oates on itunes after consuming...  Also had the bone in rib eye...tender, cooked just right and I really liked the extra spice rub that they give you.  The key lime and coffee was a great way to end the meal.  Total was about $100/per incl. tax/tip/drinks.  Not bad for Vegas, but I Can't Go for That (No Can Do) and will be trying some other stuff next time out...",

The stone crab is a must, it's sweet and well complimented by the mustard sauce.  Just watch for small bits of shell, that stuff hurts to bite down on!  The King crab legs which were enormous, and cut for you so you only need a fork for them.  Head and shoulders above the stuff you see on buffets.  Chilean Sea Bass was fork tender, excellently prepared.  Scallops are frickin awesome.  I've had both the Joes and the bacon wrapped, both are good but I prefer the Joes since scallops are easily overpowered by something as flavorful as bacon.  Portions on these are generous, one of the better deals on the menu.  Drinks: love the tonic here, they bring you out the a small bottle of it with your beverage.  Friend had the skinny cosmo recently which was too lime heavy, if you're watching calories just do something with soda water.",

Lobster Tail and the wife had the Rib Eye. Both were excellent, steak seared a perfect medium and lobster was as good as lobster gets! We had the Garlic Creamed Spinach  and Lyonnaise Potatoes for our side dishes and they were great! For dessert we had the Boston Cream pie and that was rich, but very good.

Excuse... aw hell don't excuse my vulgarity, I could die happy after eating here.   Joe's is a place I will visit every time i'm in LV whether i'm winning or losing. If you're going to eat the stone crabs, do splurge and go for the large sized claws. I tried the medium sized ones but they're not as meaty or succulent as the large claws. These large stone claws are slap your mama good and the dipping sauce everyone is raving about makes it even more unique.  Follow it up with the Oysters Rockefeller which is better than Acme Oysters and Drago's that you will find in New Orleans.   The crab cake is cooked to perfection. They are very generous with the lump crab and it is lightly battered unlike a lot of places who tend to over-batter crab cakes.  I tried the rib-eye here the first time but it was forgettable so I just stick to the seafood now.   Can't wait until my next trip to Joe's...",

The stone crabs were our app which weren't worth the money paid for.  But I'm from Maryland were we eat crabs all the time and it's hard to convince me that a place outside of the Maryland area really has some good crabs or not.  We also had asparagus but those were the worst asparagus I've ever had.  The didn't even seem completely green either like True asparagus.  The creamed spinach was the worst.  Not sure how they mess up on that.   The mash potato's were ok but I had better at Outback.  We also has the apple, keylime and banana pie.  All of them were basic except the keylime which was good.  Over all I don't see me coming back to this place and it's over rated.  If you want good crabs in Vegas go to the super market and order you some.  Or go spend your money at the Caesar buffet which is well worth the money.",

I highly recommend the south beach peach drink if you are into fruity cocktails. The waitress was polite and attentive and took very good care of us. I spilled some ketchup on my white shirt and I had 5 different members from the staff bring me seltzer water, a wash cloth and some stain remover. We definitely plan to go back.

So when I found a stone crab restaurant I was excited to finally get to try it. I had passed this restaurant while in the Caesars Palace. It's not in the actual hotel, but in the adjacent terrace building, so it might be a little hard to find. I made a reservation because in passing I noticed it was a little crowded. Our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. I ordered the Select 6 Florida Stone Crab claws, a side of sauteed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus. There were a lot of extra dishes on the table, and after ordering the waiter decided he was going to reach over me and remove them.... Bad idea!!! The poor guy knocked over my water all over the table... And not so importantly, all over me :( luckily it was just water, and I'm in Vegas having am awesome time, so no biggie!!! Our food came out, and it was pretty amazing. My boyfriend had half a slice of their signature  key lime pie and half a slice cheesecake and his face led me to believe it was nothing short of amazing. My only complaint about this restaurant is that it was filled with tables of rich douchebags who were being extremely rude to the waiters and busboys... Oh and leaving with soaking wet pants :(",

As a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble I spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  Joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!     We were given a private room with a fantastic server, Thomas.  Everything was absolutely fantastic.  We started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  It has Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Alaskan King Crab and Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.  The seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  Next I had the Stone Crab Bisque, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of stone crab.  I ordered the Lump Crab Cakes which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.    My bf had the Bone in Rib Eye which was quite possibly the best steak I've ever tasted.  It was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  Others in my party had the Bone in Filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  Also, one other ordered the Dover Sole, which I highly recommend.  It was fresh and cooked perfectly.  It was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  The Stone Crabs are also very good.  They come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back the shell pieces and savor the incredibly sweet stone crab meat.  For dessert we tried the Blueberry Pie a la mode, the Key Lime Pie and the Banana Cream Pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   However, the Banana Cream Pie was a standout.  It was amazing!  Everything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.",

Obviously their signature stone crab claws are excellent. For our entrees, I had the glazed black cod, based on the recommendation of other reviewers. I was not disappointed - it was excellent! Light, flaky, but with a little bit of sweet barbecued glaze. My husband had the steak and king crab, which was also very good. I might complain about the amount of king crab (it seemed like less than one leg), but we were so stuffed, we didn't even finish everything anyway. Our sides were the corn and creamed spinach. I would not normally have ordered corn, but this was quite good, and I loved the creamed spinach. He drank, I had club soda, and we shared a dessert. Total, with tip, was just over $150 - you could pay a lot more for a lot worse food!",

Best dish of the night was the crispy brussel sprouts. Now when you're at Joe's this should be considered a problem. Staff was nice enough but i came here to get my seasonal stone crab on, not to discuss why Vegas doesn't sell powerball tickets. Anyhow. I've finally solved the mystery. The reason why this is not up to par with Joe's is this is NOT Joe's. They license the name and use the same vendors. Think Donald Trump and how his name was licensed up the yazoo a decade ago...when he was bankrupt. Not during the current Presidential campaign. Yup. 3 stars is generous for this evening's meal.",

This year, we went for dinner, and it made all the difference. First, I was HUNGRY! Got a lovely (round) table for 8 in the back on Friday night. Service was impeccable. Friendly, attentive & charming. While everyone else was happily seafooding-out, I ordered the double cut lamb chops with mint chimichurri. \"That's a hidden treasure\", said our server.  Was she ever right. 3 or 4 big, meaty, double-cut chops. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Great selection of craft brews (I had a Stone Pale Ale and Ruination ale).  Nice to have meat/beef options that are truly a delight, and not just an afterthought. They brought dessert for our friends birthday, too. Wonderful. Great food, great atmosphere, great service, worth every penny. Well worth the $100/head.",

If you want juicy delicious large pieces of king crab, then come here.  I feel spoiled that I don't want to eat King crab anywhere else unless I know it's just as good.    Pork Chop ~ This was delicious as well.  The best pork chop I've had in my life.  It was a huge thick piece.  Perfect amount of meat and fat.    Steak ~ Had this last time we came here.  Also wouldn't expect the steak to be so delicious, but it was one of the best steaks I've had.    Side dishes ~ Pan-fried sweet corn - Delicious.  Not the most special, but a great compliment to the meal ~ Sauteed garlic spinach - also delicious.  Something that could be made elsewhere, but another great compliment to the meal.  Arriving here is a little difficult if you don't know where to go.  Best is to park at Caesar's palace and walk through the shops.  We did valet off the strip, but we were late our first time since there was so much traffic.  Last night we walked from our room at the Bellagio and arrived early.  Service was amazing.  Waiter gave us a great tip on a place in Los Angeles.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for vacation of course! I took my family here for my mom's birthday. Now I must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater I know. I've taken her out to eat at many places. I was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place I've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! She went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!  We ordered 4 servings of manhattan clam chowder, 1 grilled seafood platter , 1 pound of the smallest stone crab claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. The seafood platter came with scallops, lobster tail, and Madagascar shrimp. WOW, this is the first time I've actually LIKED scallops! They were big and meaty! The stone crab claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! It was like a classier version of the Atlantic blue crab that I am so used to eating on the East Coast. I was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. Just some lemon juice was enough!  What I love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! If they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. Sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want filet mignon or crab cakes, these meals are a great price! I brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz filet mignon and the other mac and cheese. Joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and crab cake and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. Stay away from the $9 meals. The mac and cheese was total crap. Easy mac would have been better!! It was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. My sister couldn't finish it. The steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! Each kids meal also came with a free side. One sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion I paid $9 for if not bigger!! Seriously (look at the picture I posted). The only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. Each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which I'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! Needless to say, the sundae was delicious. Seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.  As for the more adult stuff, I don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. Everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. You must get the stone crab claws! I didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! The claw regenerates! Gasp! Do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? Is it the left or right one? I digress. I tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing I can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so I can't say I would recommend the steak over the seafood. Stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, I don't have faith in those dishes. Why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway?   Oh and the complimentary bread was crap. Olive garden probably has better. Again, I don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.  Service was good. Our waitress, Mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. She didn't seem super accommodating, however. My mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. It wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. Usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.  Oh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. My family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. This is touristy Vegas!  In the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. It was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! Yum!",

No big deal because we had a drink in the nice bar.  The maitre d apologized graciously then sent us two huge pieces of pie on the house after dinner to make up for it.  You can't get better than this place people.  PS. You three star and under people crack me up.  Anyone eating here and giving this place less than 4 stars has no credibility and defective taste buds.",

We ordered the steak, an order of med stone crabs, Brussels sprouts, seafood salad, and creamed spinach. That was the perfect amount for our group of 5 girls! The stone crab was easy to eat  as they were pre cracked and they were pretty fresh! I wish i ordered the king crab legs instead. I accidentally kept biting into small pieces of the stone crab shell and its quite painful and annoying! Thats just me, next time ill order the king crabs which i think id prefer!   The seafood salad was the star of the night! It was so fresh and there was a good amount of crab legs which was awesome!   Ive had better steak than at Joes sadly. Id stick with the seafood items.   The Brussels sprouts were killer! We devoured it!  So crispy light and full of flavor! I wished we got two orders instead of ordering the creamed spinach.",

I got the crab stuffed shrimp and four cheese macaroni. The shrimp was cooked pretty well and the crab meat amount was massive and definitely made the meal. Mac n cheese----not cheesy enough. For 4 cheeses I expected way much more cheese but then again I'm a cheese head so maybe it's just me. Would go back and visit the nice bar for for another Mule but would not likely eat here again.

The first time I got the dry aged bone in rib eye, and oh my god it was amazing-completely melt in your mouth. It's also really large (24 oz) and that time I split it halfsies with my wife and just got a salad and sides.  The second time I got the wet aged bone in rib eye, and while it was also delicious and cooked to my idea of perfection. I would definitely spend the extra $15 and just get the dry aged one. When you are splurging you mine as well just get the best. I'm personally not a sea food fan but the friends and family that I go with LOVE it here, we went this last weekend and I'm sure it comes up as a topic of convo at Thanksgiving and Christmas about how good it is. The service here is absolutely fantastic, these folks are the best of the best. Picking up crumbs from the table constantly, always having a drink full. The waiter knowing each and every beer they have on the menu as available, the knowledge about the dishes is phenomenal. I am truly impressed by how professional they are.  Best spot to eat in Vegas for fine dining, hands down.",

    "text": "Had dinner with a party of approximately 18 people. The service here is simply outstanding, they are just on top of everything and work as a team...awesome. The food was amazing as I expected it to be: king crab, stone crab and grilled prawn appetizers all done to perfection and a very nice bread basket too. Entrees (steaks and seafood) were prepared perfectly and everyone enjoyed, no complaints, but there were a couple of exceptions. The mac and cheese side was disappointing. It was very small as compared to the other sides, we had them all to share. It was not very cheesy either. The stuffed mushroom appetizer was not good. Not sure what the heck is on top (almost like sour cream), they should revisit that recipe.....others seemed to think they were ok.   Let me just say I applaud Joe's for providing a Gluten-free and Vegan menu in the first place, however you better bring it. I was sitting close to someone who ordered the pasta with seasonal vegetables and felt extremely sorry for him. It was literally dry fettuccine with dark vegetables, absolutely no sauce. It was not appetizing looking at all. Obviously not enough thought was put into that dish and a huge disappointment even for those who sat nearby, this person who chose not to complain got down as much as possible before giving up. He made the most of the apps and bread, but actually said he would something later....shame, but I do say he did not give them a chance to fix it or provide an alternative :(  As I scoped out the surrounding tables, there were many tables of folks that were obviously visiting for conventions, etc. Lot of food and drink ordered, but there was also ALOT of waste. I noticed several times plates with a good amount of food being removed from the tables (the appetizers which are shared) only to go straight into the trash. I asked our waiter to box up our leftover apps and took them home. I have contacted Joe's asking them to consider donating to Three-Square as so many other restaurants and casinos do, this is simply terrible for all that food to go to waste when there are hungry people in our valley. I hope they will consider and by example encourage the rest of the Ceasar's establishments to do the same.  One last note: Only a few opted for dessert - the apple pie ala mode, holey moley that was a meal itself. The person who ordered it did a very nice job polishing it off and was almost successful at keeping others to a single forkful. It was huge and looked amazing, totally chock full of apples and seemingly very cinnamony, with a thin crust (YAY!!), with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream....wow, I would highly recommend that, but you have to give up part of dinner, there is just so much food.  Overall, a wonderful meal and we will return. Just a couple things could use some work.",

    "text": "Holy crab claws. This spot does not mess around. Everything is excellent from the service, to the seafood, to the steaks.  Had a tremendous Englishwoman as our server. She was sassy and knowledgeable and provided impeccable recommendations (how many crab claws to get, suggested that I get my bone in filet medium as opposed to my usual medium rare to avoid a cool bone).  The large crab claws were impressive and generally amazing. The bone in filet had a wonderful crust. Even the chopped salad was really well executed.  It's easy to eat here when it's covered by work. Between the three of us, we dropped $600 (the other two fools kept on ordering quality scotch... I was super jealous as I wasn't drinking but that's another story). So yeah I wouldn't come here if you're looking to save a penny or two.  I would still make a point to come here and pay for a great meal on my own dime. I would seek this place out if you're looking for a great combination of seafood and steak. If you're just gunning for the one of the greatest steaks in your life you may want to look elsewhere (but it's still incredible here).  By the way my buddies asked for their steak rub to go and they gladly accommodated for free. A pretty nice to go cup that will season up my steaks in the future!",

Our server was nice and very accommodating to our group of 7 busy girls.  An absolute must here is the crab claws. ABSOLUTE! We did two orders of the medium claws (7 claws per order at $39 an order). Tasty crab claws itself, the flavor is put over the top when you pair it with their special sauce.   We tried 3 sides amongst the 7 of us to pair with our entrees and still had leftovers. The side portions are pretty big.  Sides: Lyonnaise potatoes: perfect crisp on the outside & great flavor with the onions in the middle Creamed Spinach: not noteworthy but decent Sauteed Corn: probably the favorite of the sides. The flavor was really good. I would order this again  I can't speak on behalf of the other girls' entrees as I didn't try it but the restaurant was kind enough to split any entrees to two plates before it was served to us if anyone was sharing. This made things run a lot smoother & it was much appreciated.   I split the scallops with a friend as my entree and it was definitely enough for the both of us to be full. Granted we did have a lot of sides & had snacked on the yummy bread basket that was served in the beginning. These are probably some of the best scallops I have ever had. Cooked to perfection! Flavor & texture was great. I highly recommend it.   Overall: this place was great. A superb meal of fine food.",

Cheeseburger $18, Joe's fried chicken $22 (minus any side), Crab Louis $24, seafood chopped salad $27, tuna Nicoise salad $22, mahi tacos $19, fish & chips $22, Ahi tuna $36, coleslaw $8, & all desserts $8.  My friend had the seafood salad & I opted for my usual Crab Louis.  She enjoyed hers, which was larger & more interesting than mine, as I felt they scrimped on the crab.  The bread basket is varied & tasty, but the server took it away along with our bread plates way too soon.  We also had to flag him down for a dessert menu & then ended up splitting a custard cake w/caramel topping  I'd give that cake a 3-1/2 (of 5).

    "text": "I love this place! This most recent trip was probably one of the best dinners I have had. Oysters were delicious, stone crab, and Caesar salad were all on the mark. We shared the bone in ribeye and the mashed potatoes. The salt that comes with the steak perfectly compliments the prime beef and we happened to catch the somme series and were able to try the gaja barolo whose dryness paired exceptionally with the steak. For desert we decided to sample another of the featured  wines and we got a slice of the fudge pie that again paired perfectly with the wine. The service was impecable as usual. This is truly a dining experience that I can't wait to repeat. We literally come to vegas to go to Joe's.",

    "text": "All I can think about from my Vegas trip is Joe's Seafood!! It wasn't about all the partying, drinking, gambling or any of that it was just how darn good this place was !!   The night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. Mainly looking through yelp to find one. I didn't really want to get a buffet but I wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! I got what I wanted and called Joe's Seafood up.   They said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. While walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in Vegas and I saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts.   I did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. So off we went on this find adventure!!  The Order:  Crab Cake- It is one large crab cake which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. The inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. The taste is amazing and I would say this is on my top 10 list of crab cakes.   Stone Crab Claw- Had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. Just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. The flavor is nice and and amazing. I wish I could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!  Crab Bisque- Not my favorite thing on my meal. I didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. It tasted way too fatty for me and I just didn't like it.   Parmesan Crusted Halibut- Need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. Also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. Love love it!! Must order if you come here.   Half order of mashed potatoes- On the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. I can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!  Half order of mac and cheese- I see mushrooms yeah !! :) I liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. Not from Kraft and it does taste a whole lot better.   Overall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. I know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..I can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! Most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! Everything was large and good !! The only thing I would suggest not getting is the crab bisque.   But my experience at Joe's has made me want to come to Vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! See you soon Joe!",

The ambiance was intimate and our server was very attentive and gracious.   The food was splendid. My boyfriend and I had the filet and tail. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked (we both had it medium rare) and the lobster tail was very tender and didn't have the rubber texture to it.   My mom had the crab claws and my brother had his rib-eye steak and they both enjoyed it.  Our server cleared out the table once we were done and served my brother a medium sized brownie with vanilla ice cream and with a candle on top. No birthday song but my brother isn't fond of birthday songs anyways so that was a huge plus for him/all of us.  The awesome thing about that was that I didn't give them any special instructions at all! I remember my mom saying happy birthday to my brother when he arrived and the guy who handles the reservation over heard her and greeted him as well. I guess he let our server know! Very impressed on how discreet they were about it.  One minor gripe was our seating. We were seated right next to the kitchen but meh. I was not too bothered by it. The overall experience was excellent.  10/10 would come again.",

When we arrived on a busy night, they had lost our reservation.  However, the main host remembered us and took care to get us set up as soon as possible.  It for some reason had not been communicated to the people setting up the table, but they did everything they could to let us know they would get us taken care of.  I don't even eat shellfish, but all of their food is so good.  The steaks are as good as Mastros and the brussel sprouts are to die for.  Two people at the table got the Steak Frites and said it was they best they had ever had.  The service was excellent and they don't push you to order more sides than you need. The best thing I tried was the lemon sole.  I will definitely go back for it!",

    "text": "Our server \"Linda Demarzio\" (the one with perfect diction and precise grammar) was nothing short of amazing!  Fun, funny, witty, wonderful, charming, and chimerical!  Linda was attentive to our every need. Smart enough to see that we had a great sense of humor (so we had multiple fun exchanges). She bussed the table herself several times to keep things moving, and was very helpful with the menu and food suggestions. When the time came for the check, it came quickly. No pressure. The other wait staff was wonderful too. No fuss. No muss!  So, why only two stars?  First, \"Tim,\" the first person we met, was abrupt from the get go.  We arrived about 15 minutes early, it looked very busy, so I gently asked if there were any chance that we could be seated early. \"Tim\" responded with a curt, \"No,\" said we would be seated as soon as our table was ready, and with a dismissive snort suggested that we were out of our minds to even think about asking.  We walked around for 15 minutes & returned at our reservation time. I alerted Tim we were back, our whole party was there, and we were ready to be seated. He impatiently reiterated that we would be seated at soon as our table was \"ready.\" Nonetheless, I heard him get on his radio and ask for a \"small\" table.  Ultimately, Tim spent his time focusing on the larger parties of six and eight, and we fell through the cracks.  15 minutes after our reservation time, I asked when we would be seated, and Tim proceeded to scold me about how reservations \"worked\" in a restaurant and said he was waiting for other people to leave our table before we could be seated. He then again got on his radio and made a new request for a table for two. Bottom line, no actual tables are reserved. A \"reservation\" to them apparently means you still have to wait for a table -- I guess it's just a shorter wait than someone who just walked in off the street. It was much like the Cheese Cake Factory business model, but without the vibrating and flashing pagers handed out so you can walk around The Mall as a distraction from the interminable wait.   We were eventually seated 20 minutes after our reservation time & 35 minutes after we first walked into the place -- and that was only after I asked to see a manager.   Second, the place is basically an over-priced (but leas classy version of) Red Lobster.  In a word, the food was mediocre. The calamari appetizer was soggy & doughy. We split the BLT Wedge salad. It was just average. I had the grilled seafood platter. The dish was tough & overcooked & skimpy at the price point charged. Even the bread was just \"so - so\".   With SO many choices for food in Vegas, I would spend my money elsewhere, if I were you. I know for sure, next time I will!",

So for my anniversary my boyfriend decided we should try this place out. The service was spectacular to begin with and the place is old school elegant. There was so many things we both wanted to try but we narrowed it down the crab bisque (amazing), just very creamy. We ordered the 1.5lb of Alaskan crab legs (HOLY COW THIS WAS ORGASMIC) minus the fact that it was 80$ for this plate it was money well spent! You must must get this! We opt for this instead of their stone crab because it just seems like a better deal to be honest. Then we got a filet, our filet was the disappointing part of our meal and thus Joe's got a 4 stars from me. We sent back the filet the first time because it was overly charred and just wasnt good. Our server sent out a new filet for us and I still had a displeasure taste in my mouth, it was just not good unfortunately for a steakhouse it was very disappointing :(  Joe's your crab saved you ! I will return if I have another chance for your crab legs.. One of the most amazing thing I ever eaten.",

You know you are in for great service when the waiters are each dressed in tuxedos and have an average 10-15 years tenure, but to find the food equally as enjoyable was quite a treat. Sharing on all the plates of my colleagues, I can tell you that there is nothing less than excellent on the entire menu; even starting with the bread basket (which included the best jalapeno cornbread I have ever tasted). For desert - the key lime pie was also the best I have ever had! There is so much I could individually comment on but I will refer to my attached pictures for further speculation.  5 stars only because I cannot rate it 10.",

I am not sure why they have such a high rating. Service was really good and the waiter knew his stuff the price-point is a bit high but quality of food is lacking!!!!!!   The bread they bring out as an appetizer was standard some pieces though tasted like hospital bread, you know the bread they serve in a plastic bag at the hospitals. NOT IMPRESSED.   I ordered the Filet Mingon and I was not impressed more so disappointed ... I ordered it medium on the bone. Half the steak was cooked well and the inside was cooked medium.The filet was chewy at the end and not packed with that juicy flavor you suppose to get out of a filet. The ends toward the bone were very very fatty. POORLY COOKED FILET MINGON. The swordfish was not good. Did not taste fresh and was a bit on the rubbery side. Just so wrong. The sauce that comes on top was flavorless.   The stuffed mushrooms with spinach were very good and tasted great, perfect play between cheesy and crunchy.  I believe there specialty is stone crab but we didn't try it. Its supposedly these crabs that they tear off one claw and throw them back into the ocean....  My suggestion though is with a bill close to 160 dollars for food the quality of two entrees 2 deserts and a cappuccino did not deliver great quality food for value.   THE ONLY REASON I WOULD GO BACK IS FOR THERE AMAZING PIE. WHILE THE BANANA FOSTER IS GOOD THE KEY LIME PIE IS JUST HEAVEN ON EARTH MADE BY THE KEY LIME PIE GDS. ITS BEYOND AMAZING. I'm a huge fan of key lime pie and this is in the top two best key lime pies Ive ever had in my life. GO THERE AND JUST ASK FOR A SLICE OF KEY LIME PIE. They have a baker that comes in every morning and specifically bakes THE PIES. It delivers freshness and this thick graham crust, its scary to say PERFECT.   KEY POINTS TO KNOW ABOUT SEATING:   IF YOU ARE GOING THERE FOR DINNER EVEN AFTER I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE WITH BETTER QUALITY FOOD AND YOU WANT THE WHITE TABLECLOTH DARK DINNER FEEL, WALK TO THE BACK......ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK. IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE MAN THAT SITS YOU IN FRONT HE WILL SIT YOU AT TABLES NEAR THE BAR AREA OR OUTSIDE BY THE FRONT WHICH IS GREAT FOR LUNCH BUT I REALLY DIDN'T WANT THE WHOLE EAT DINNER OVERLOOKING MALL SHOPS EXPERIENCE FOR LATE DINNER.  SO JUST HEAD ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK.... The place is huge and there is more seating options than what you see. They have an upstairs and a romantic dim lit back room.",

Beyond attentive for such a busy Monday night.  He even got me to try the key lime pie which I have refused to try up until this point.  This place is to die for.",

My review was based on that single mediocre experience when meanwhile every other experience has been delightful.   Last night I dined again with Joe's and the experience met and in some cases exceeded my expectations.    The service was impeccable and the food sublime.   Crab claws - yummy Chopped Salad - fresh and full of flavor  Crab legs- served warm ( at my request) tender, sweet, flavorful and meaty.  Havana Dream Pie- the real reason I went there, every thing else I ate was just leading up to this dessert.  It did not disappoint. Light, rich, creamy and delicious. The perfect finish to the perfect meal.",

Hated eating in the middle of a mall but hey that might just be me!  As far as service goes. I always have had exceptional service at the Joes Chicago location. Some of the best service in the world! As far as Vegas goes awful service. Didn't give me a bowl for my stone crab shells. Didn't know the ingredients in the main dishes. And worst of all for someone who eats at joes on a weekly basis... I like using my reward points toward my dinners. Even though I asked our waiter twice he denied that I had any points toward my meal. Checked my app had $40... disappointing.   Joes in Chicago and Miami is wonderful but you need to skip the Vegas location. This location shouldn't even be affiliated with the chain.",

We also received house bread which came in a variety of different types of unique bread with butter.   Main course I ordered the Florida Stone Crab Claws. I chose the medium that came in 7 per order. This was my first time trying stone crab claws and I loved every piece of it. The shells are already cracked for you and it is easy to remove the shells to access the crab meat. It came with their special sauce.  Overall experience was pleasant",

Service was both professional and friendly and just the right amount. Some higher end establishments can almost over do their attention like a hovering helicopter parent. Not Here.

You can valet your car here and go right in without walking deep into the shops where many other places like Cheese factory etc. are. Everyone employed here are friendly and informative. I've been going to this restaurant the past ten years and I still see a lot of the staff still working here so people are obviously making good money and are taken care of.   When I come here for lunch, I generally order the lump crab salad and get a side or the mustard sauce used when they serve the stone crab claws. When I order dinner I order a couple of their massive Madagascar shrimp, tomatoes with cheese and corn. Every now and then I will get the Alaskan king crab or stone crab claws but they are also known for their steaks.   My favorite cut is their dry aged bone in ribeye. The sommeliers know their wines as I trust their judgement. Even sitting at the front bar I have spotted various celebrities. Five star service all the way.",

Had the chance finally and had high hopes. The place is nice and quaint. The service was just ok. Wasn't great but not horrible either. We ordered stone crab and king crab to start. Now crab in itself is easy to cook. You can't really mess this up and they didn't. The crab was very good. I looked over their menu and saw steaks, salads and seafood. I looked at their lunch menu too. I saw a chef creation and got excited. It was called The Elote Burger. If you don't know what elote is it's Mexican street corn . It is roasted and covered in mayo, chilli powder, lime juice, cheese etc. One of my favorites. So I figured HELL YEAH and ordered the elote burger and left it up to the chef to decide best temperature and preperation. It reads that it comes with Mexican corn, cilantro, aioli etc. Sounds delicious.  I received the burger and it looked delicious. Then I bit it......ugh.......i just sat back for a minute and disappointment set in. This is a upper echelon restaurant and the burger is 18.00$$. The cilantro worked well and  the meat was juicy. There was absolutely NO FLAVOR to the patty. Not even a grain of salt. I expected multiple layers of flavor and SPICE!! Nope nothing. Not even close to elote. Was so unhappy. I expect a bit more from this type of restaurant. But I could have had a burger ANYWHERE else and it would have been better. If you are a 4.5 star restaurant and place a burger on your menu it better be DAMN GOOD!. This was not. Good Luck Joe's!",

    "text": "Every time my bf and I go on vacation, we always try to have one fancy romantic dinner before we leave. He booked a reservation upon reading the amazing reviews and I have to say- Joes did not disappoint!  The service was impeccable! Our waitress, I think her name was Barbara, was so amazing. She gave us great recommendations and always had a smile on her face. Very attentive, always asking if we needed anything and refilled our waters without having to ask once.  We ordered the bone in rib eye and the porterhouse. Both were delicious! If we had to choose... order the rib eye hands down! So juicy.... so tender... the flavor ugh just delicious. We also got the mashed potatoes and crispy onion strings as sides. (don't order too many sides! They're shareable!) The onion strings were good but the mashed potatoes I wasn't a big fan of just because they had a topping that reminded me of cheddar Cheetos. I'm sad that we didn't try the seafood but we were both craving some meat so next time we're in Vegas we'll come here so we can try it all!  Also, I love a restaurant that gives amazing bread as a starter.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!! (=",

First off, service was outstanding, they made us feel as if we were regulars, they tended to all of our needs, even the ones we didn't know we needed! I had the 16oz prime ribeye steak, loaded baked potato and green beans (just thinking about it makes me hungry), some of the best I've ever had! Some of my clients had the branzino and others the sea bass and all were very pleased with their dinner.  I will definitely make it a point to have dinner there when I go back to Las Vegas.  Great job!",

    "text": "3.5 stars, rounding down to 3 because of the lack of value.  I should have known better. How could a tourist trap have a world class restaurant?  Answer: that never happens.  When I arrived, there were endless employees standing around, but none of them were interested in seating me.  I finally rested my body and elbow on the podium after a while, so that my body language would scream \"I've been waiting for a while, can one of the idle employees please seat me\".  I got seated shortly thereafter.  They put me at one of those high chair setups like at a happy hour.  Not my favorite but it worked.    I ordered a crab cake appetizer, a glass of house red, the dover sole with brown butter, and a side of spinache.  With tip, this came out to a $120 bill.  I was ok with spending that much, but once I finished, I didn't think it was worth it.  The crab cake was quite good.  I thought it would come with 2, but just one.  The sauce could have been a bit better, but the crab cake was truly meaty and tasty.    The house red was also enjoyable.  The dover sole was mostly a disappointment.  It didn't seem freshly made, though I don't know how that could be the case.  Maybe it was overcooked.  I can make sole better at home actually.  The brown butter sauce was one of the best sauces I've ever had, and that's what made the dish. But at $50 a la carte, I thought that was too much.    The side of spinach was good, though a bit oily.    I thought the service was attentive but a bit somber, not sure how to characterize it.  It was effective and they did their job very well, just not engaging.  Might be a preference thing.   The closest comparison I can make with this place is Bonefish Grill, and there is one or two in town.  I would rate Bonefish Grill slightly higher across the board in the items I had, and I would have spent less than $50 there for the same items.",

We ordered the medium size crabs, which were sweet, cold and tasted out of this world with Joe's mustard sauce. Following we were treated with the King Louis salad, which is shareable.  Plenty of crab, avocado, hearts of palm and quartered egg made this salad quite delicious.  I love this place and cannot wait to come back for the Stone Crab.",

    "text": "Absolutely impeccable service! Our servers were always attentive, but not intrusive. We were never waiting or wondering where our server disappeared to - something that happens so often in many other restaurants that mediocre or poor service has become a new \"normal\" - not at Joes. This place has friendly, knowledgeable and attentive servers.  The calamari and crab cakes are outstanding. On this visit we had steaks for entrees, and for fairly expensive steaks I'd have to say they were good, but not quite on the level of some other restaurants at similar price point. Also tried the fried chicken, with high hopes based on the calamari experience. Again it was pretty good, but not outstanding. Their take on fried chicken uses a cracker crumb base in the breading - not my particular favorite, so I can't get too excited.  Sides of hash browns and creamed spinach were pretty good, but not outstanding. For desert we tried the banana cream pie, and even splitting in 2 servings the potions were huge, and the pie was delicious.   Overall a great dinner, but the standout is the service.",

I ordered a grilled seafood platter which is was part of a special menu for restaurant week. I really hope they do start offering this on their regular menu because if was one of freshest and tastiest seafood platters I have had in Las Vegas. I would have taken a picture of it for you all, but I got completely distracted by the delicious aromas emanating from my platter and before you know it, it was all gone!!!  Our server Bill was very nice, extra attentive to all our need and a class act.  Overall Joe's is a classy restaurant with a cool vibe and most importantly, with top quality seafood.  We will definitely be back to try some of their other items on the menu.",

The Food: Apps Shrimp Cocktail - The shrimps were huge and tasted great! The cocktail sauce was extremely hot, but I don't mind it that way.  Large stone crab claws w/mustard sauce - Those claws held the sweetest most buttery crab I have ever tasted. The mustard sauce definitely put it over the top! Heck, even my boyfriend, who usually turns his nose up to mustard sauces enjoyed it.   Main Course Filet & Lobster tail - AMAZING! The filet was seasoned and cooked to perfection! One of the best I have ever had. The lobster tail was sweet and tasty.  Stuffed Sole - So good! This was my boyfriends dish, and he reluctantly gave up a bite to me. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was wonderful.   Grilled corn side dish - It is rare to find a side dish that can hold its own against a meal, but this corn was absolutely delicious. The corn was off the cob and grilled to perfection. Topped with butter, cilantro, lime, and salt.",

My husband proposed to me there in 2010.  We went there last week (on the 4th anniversary of our engagement).  My husband told the maitre'd it was a special occasion, which he ignored and said \"tell your waiter\" (which we did). We arrived at 7 p.m.   We were rushed to order.  Our food arrived within 5 minutes (we were having cold crab legs and hot sides).  It was faster than McDonalds.  We were never asked if we would like coffee or dessert and the anniversary of our engagement was totally forgotten.  We were presented with the check at 7:25 p.m. 30 minutes after sitting down.  There were many empty tables, so the rush was very weird. Our 30 minute dinner wasn't cheap, either.  Won't be back any time soon",

    "text": "Located inside the Forum Shops inside Caesar's Palace, it is a cute place with outside seating if you want to have a nice meal by the water fountain and secretly people watch. Not to mention, it is conveniently located right next to Vosges Haut Chocolat (I highly recommend their boxes of truffles).   My dining experience can be best described as mediocre. Great intentions, questionable execution. I really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. Two of the things I absolutely love is steak and seafood. When you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.   Bread basket- I usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. It is delicious. The variety is great. The pretzel mini loaf is really cute.   Filet mignon- sadly, it is unimpressive. It had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. And a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when I asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done.   Alaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. Served with lemon and butter.   Jennie's mashed potatoes- Not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either.   Lyonnaise potatoes- Pretty good. I enjoyed eating it.   Key Lime Pie- signature dessert was okay. Not my personal preference.   Havana Dream Pie- Yum. This one is delicious. Might be a bit too sweet but still good. Served with slices of strawberries. It is soft, creamy, and sweet.   Banana Cream Pie- This one is my favorite dessert. It is delicious. Not too sweet. Great banana flavor. light and airy.   The service here is friendly and efficient. A tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. Slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. An elbow almost knocking someone out. And taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. Maybe I'm being overly picky but I'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement.   Would I come back again? I might just to give this place one more chance. I really wanted to like it but it was way below expectations.",

I order takeout constantly, and can never go wrong regardless of what it is. Everything has so much flavor, even the simplest items. Great burger, great appetizers, awesome entrees. I love bringing home the desserts too, they have the best season pies. They are pretty far away from the parking garage, but the valet right outside is great. And don't be afraid to order takeout - just tell the valet Guys and they will do their best to keep you close while you pick up your amazing food!",

    "text": "Fantastic experience. While on our honeymoon, my husband and I wanted to spoil ourselves with one night out to a really great restaurant. After much research, we decided on Joe's. We made a reservation online. We showed up right on time and waited about 5 minutes to be seated. I have never seen a place so packed in my life. The restaurant is huge.  We were seated at a booth in their back room. Our waitor was fantastic. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  We ordered calamari for an appetizer. I love calamari and order it almost anywhere I can. I'm from New England so I love seafood. This was probably some of the best cooked calamari I've ever had. It wasn't chewy at all, with a melt in your mouth texture. The seasoning was perfect.  My husband ordered the petite filet. It was, also, cooked perfect. Warm red center and didn't even need a steak knife to cut through.  I ordered the crab stuffed shrimp. It was really good. Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but still really good. I do wish I would have ordered the petite filet after tasting my husbands, though. It was that good. We ordered a side of Jennie's mashed potatoes which were fantastic.  But, to my favorite part... dessert.... I ordered the apple pie and my husband ordered the coconut cream pie. His was good. Mine was incredible. The piece of pie they gave my was GIANT with a generous helping of vanilla ice cream. My husband ate all of his and then some of mine it was so big. I dream about that apple pie now.  Just go. It's great. The service is fantastic and the food is amazing. Worth every penny.",

    "text": "I admittedly picked this restaurant solely on the numerous, positive Yelp reviews, but went with a skeptical eye -- good steak in Vegas?  Just outside an indoor fountain at Caesar's Palace that houses a Gelato shop, the restaurant looked great and elegant on the outside. We were seated immediately outside and ordered many appetizers, Single Malts (alcoholic drink), and main dishes.  The waitress was cheery and recommended a seafood appetizer sampler that contained oysters, King Crab legs, and Rock Crab legs. The oysters were very tiny, but the King Crab legs were absolutely delicious!  For the main courses, most of us tried the waitress-recommended Bone-in Rib Eye. Comparing it to the steaks we had at Mesa Grill (Caesar's Palace) and Bouchon (Venetian), this was our absolute favorite steak of the week-long trip! Bouchon, by the way, isn't recommended by us for steak.  This restaurant was on my mind all week-long despite other good places we went to, such as SambaSushi (Palazzo) and Pho Kim Loan (Chinatown).  Come here for the Bone-in Rib Eye steak and the King Crab legs!",

    "text": "Came to Joe's for my sisters birthday dinner, and overall, the food experience can be summed up in one word - underwhelming.    We started with the crab bisque, which happened to be the most flavorful dish of the evening.  After that, we had a round of the oysters Rockefeller.  The oysters were unfortunately so incredibly salty that it was hard to eat more than one.  I pointed that out to our waiter, who's response was \"that's just the nature of oysters.\"  Now, having had hundreds of oysters all over the country, I'm fully aware that is not True.  Then came the entrees and sides.  We ordered the seafood platter, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, the mashed potatoes, fried asparagus and Mac and cheese.  We shared bites around the table and everyone's reaction to the food was the same: BLAND.  The \"gravy\" on the shrimp and grits, while appearing colorful and packed with flavor turned out to be under seasoned and flavorless.  What a bore.  The fried chicken was dry and also flavorless.  My sisters husband describe the coating on the outside as \"the flavor of toast.\"  He said the white meat of the chicken had more flavor than the coating.   One saving grace, however, was the grilled lobster tail on the seafood platter.  Found the flavor!  When the waiter came over to check on us, we expressed how underwhelming the food was, he brushed it off and walked away.  Horrible.  For all the great food in Vegas, this is not a worthy option in the least.",

    "text": "Calling all tourists!!!  Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab really is just a tourist trap with a few great options and a lot of okay items you are privileged to pay Strip pricing for...  If you do find yourself here just ignore the inflated prices and stick to what they're know for: Stone Crab Claws, King Crab Legs, Crab Bisque, Filet Mignon...even Scallops with Pork Belly.  I've been here three times over the years and every time I've tried to explore the menu a bit and share some items with the table. I keep coming back because what the do well, they really do well. But in the end I just think that you can get a better meal at a much better price. It's not that Joe's breaks the bank...just that most of the menu is 10-20% overpriced. I have no problem with spending a little more than the actual quality of the product calls for, but if I do, I want it to be really great food or good food in an incredible setting...Joe's doesn't do either of these well enough that I see myself continuing to come back. Don't get me wrong, it is good. If I was in the immediate area I'd have no problem stopping in...but i'm not going out of my way to go here when there are so many better options at the same price point all around Vegas.",

We ordered the Filet Oscar which is an 6oz Filet and a piece of King Crab leg.  The asparagus was undercooked which is how they are so that part I didn't like but wife loved it which is all that matters.  The Filet was so so soft and juicy....definitely the best Filet I had.  Also ordered the stone crabs just to try and that is not worth it for the price is way too high.  The price for the Filet Oscar was reasonable IMO for the quality of the food is not comparable so if you want good stuff then this is the place.",

Your service staff was very knowledgeable and was very attentive.  We had planned on our meal taking awhile bc it was busy and Mother's Day but everything came out fast and hot. It was all amazing! I had the surf n turf but next time I think I need just that huge lobster tail and crab legs because they both looked wonderful. My husband Im sure had the Bone-in ribeye and we shared some sides.

    "text": "As an adult I have grown to love seafood. When I was younger you couldn't get me to touch anything but grilled cheese and hotdogs (I was a picky eater as a  kid).  I have had the opportunity to try many great seafood restaurants. One of my favorites by far is Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab. The quality of seafood and the spot on service make for an unforgettable seafood adventure!  One meal from Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab I highly recommend is the Filet Oscar. The Filet Oscar is a Filet Mignon with Alaskan King Crab, Asparagus in a Bearnaise Sauce. It was so flavorful! The combination of steak and crab topped with the creamy bearnaise sauce was savory and delectable. The crab was perfection.  If you go to Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab you MUST try the Stone Crab. All I can say is Holy moly guacamole! The best  crab I have ever had. This dish is a necissity when dining at this restaurant. (Make sure to squeeze a little lemon over it). You will melt over the perfection of Joe's Stone Crab. The claws are huge and you get a huge plate of them. I highly suggest you add this to your order!  Besides the meals I mentioned above, the entire menu at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab is amazing, delicious and unforgettable. Make sure to taste their some of their mouthwatering dishes before leaving Las Vegas!

    "text": "Not a bad meal, it started off with some weak drinks. Our group devoured a couple bowls of oysters right off the bat, dinner was mediocre. I ordered the 8oz filet with crab legs, the server put my crab legs three people away from me, she must have thought we were going communal on them. The steak was cooked well, and it comes with some extra seasoning, which you will need as it is a rather bland piece of meat. The crab legs were tasty, I'd go back for those. The highlight of the meal was probably the Havana Dream pie, that is some good dessert. Stop in and try the place out if you happen to be hungry at the Forum Shops.",

We'd had reservations at Top of the World for weeks, but changed our minds at the last minute after reading reviews on both spots. I am so glad we did!! The only problem we had was parking. Self park is too far away. We finally asked someone who was working at the forum shops valet (full) and they directed us to the Valet right by Joe's. Never would have known it was back there otherwise. Our last minute reservations were honored as soon as we arrived. Our booth was in a great location. Everyone congratulated us and was very kind. It took us a while to decide on our meals and our waiter was very patient. The little bread basket was adorable. We started with the chopped salad and the dressing was divine. It was just lettuce, tomatoes and onions (The salad is overpriced in my opinion) Although we cringed at the $79 price on the king crab legs, I encouraged my husband to indulge himself and they were REALLY good! I had the petite filet and it cut like butter. Fantastic flavor. The grilled corn was super yummy. The Jenny's mashed potatoes tasted good, but they were barely even warm. That was a disappointment, but we ate them anyways. We were given complimentary desserts. I had the key lime pie, he had the bananas foster pie. Both were delicious. I can honestly say that I will return to Joe's in the future, but only for special occasions as we do not make it a habit to spend $225 on meals for two",

All the servers in suits and bow ties. Fancy.  Service was excellent! Our waiter, I believe his name was Dave, was on point with his description of the menu as if he wrote it himself, attentive, and funny.  Food:  -Fried calamari - cooked perfectly, batter was amazing. 5/5 -Fried oysters - ^^^ The same. 5/5 -Clam Chower - 5/5 Wish I had more space in my belly. -Large Stone Crab - They weren't joking about the claw size. Meaty, and sweet 5/5 -Filet Mignon Bone-in - Was kinda charred, and a little dry. 3/5 -Key Lime Pie - This was the best key lime pie I've ever had in my life. I would totally order this again. 5/5+ -1.5lb Alaskan King Crab - Now this was the jewel of my meal. The biggest king crab legs I've ever had the pleasure of shoving in my face hole. 5/5++++  What made my dinning experience a bit better was that we had a party of 8 and when they sat us, they took us to a private room dinning room away from all the \"commoners.\" Lol. Honestly, felt like we had a private dinning experience. Super VIP status. Want to dine here again the next time I'm in town, but may just stick with the seafood.",

The food was excellent it's a bit noisy but that's to be expected place does 800 covers and night so if you want some good grub I suggest going there.",

    "text": "Been here atleast a half-dozen times.  While it is expensive, everyone we take here says they never had seafood like this before, even those from coastal areas.     Service is always professional and you feel special. So it is perfect for impressing people or making it a memorable special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary.  My favorite is the Grilled Madagascar Shrimp, one shrimp is like a meal in itself.   Creamed Spinach is a good side, I prefer their Snow Crabs over Stone Crabs, but you will not be disappointed with either, because they are by far the freshest you ever had. I recall having to ask for drawn butter one time, which they happily provided, but not sure they forgot it or if I really had to ask for it.   The wine menu is extensive and there is something for everyone. The somm(s) are great.  While most Somms will not recommend a Reds don't go with seafood, we started with a fruit forward California Red that is delicious on its own as an appetizer, while waiting for your crab and seafood,. Of course if you get steak or other meats then by all means  get it a red with the meal.  The wines by the glass are excellent.  I prefer sparkling with seafood since it goes well with just about everything, except super spicy. Wines are a bit pricey but get something you really want to try, but have never been willing to pay $$$ to buy the bottle.",

As soon as I walked in, I felt like I was transported to a beautiful ballroom in the Titanic where all the upper class elite are dining.   The service here is impeccable and the food is the epitome of what every restaurant should aspire to be.   I started off with a peach flavored martini rimmed with sugar that was delicious. I could barely taste the alcohol and it went down so smoothly.  Our first appetizer was a 12-piece Rockefeller oyster rack. I am in awe at how fresh and tasty it was! I feel like they had just plucked the oysters from the ocean and brought it right to my plate. All of the oysters were perfectly chilled and the mix of sauces it came with made my mouth water. This was definitely the highlight of the night.   The crab bisque is a must have! I loved every second of this soup. The flavors were so complex and at every corner I tasted a different flavor. It is creamy and hearty all in one.   I ordered the pan sauteed branzino fish with lemon and capers. I enjoyed it. It's a healthy option and the sauce they use is drool worthy.   We ordered the key lime pie for dessert and it was bomb! Tart and sweet with a kick ass crust. I salute Joe's for creating the best key lime pie in California.   Overall, this was an amazing meal and I am so happy we came here for dinner! With all of the options in Vegas, I think we definitely made the right choice.",

You get what you pay for and quality is exceptional.

Unfortunately, Joe's was already our second choice of the night (after seeing the long line at Bacchanal) and we weren't going in search of a 3rd restaurant. We were hungry, so, let's eat at Joe's.  Luckily, the other food was pretty tasty. We started with some glasses of inexpensive Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon and a Colossal Lump Crab Cake ($17). I liked the big bits of crab that didn't require (or have) much other seasoning (4 stars).   Equally, the Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze & Bok Choy ($37) and 20 oz. Bone-In Rib Eye Steak ($53) were 4-star entrees. The sea bass was flaky and the miso subtle. Meanwhile, the juicy and tender rib eye was meaty despite not being an elite steak. As a side, we split a creamy Wild Mushroom Mac and Cheese ($11) that excited thanks to the mushrooms and disappointed with lame cheese (3 stars).  Sadly, the service was weak. We suffered long gaps between being seated, ordering, getting food, or service. We wanted to try the acclaimed Key Lime Pie, but chose to try a different place at the Forum Shops at Caesars rather than put up with the poor service.  Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is famous in Miami for fantastic Stone Crabs and Key Lime Pie. We didn't get to try either. Instead, Joe's became a basic Joe Schmo steak and seafood chain with high prices for the average Joe.",

She was very sweet & well versed in her knowledge of the menu. Could not have been happier with the filet lunch special! It was an excellent recommendation - great value for money!!! I will definitely be visiting again soon & will bring more company! Can't wait to try the next item on the menu!",

Stone Crab 5/5 - it was good (you can never go wrong with stone crabs though).  Crab bisque 5/5 - very good... almost like a comfort food... very cream and rich.  Chilean seabass 2/5 - i think this is overpriced.. $42 for a small piece of fish (that i didnt even finish), i was expecting more from it since i thought you can never go wrong with bass but the sauce was way too salty and overpowering, the fish wasnt even as good as Im used to.  Sole 2/5 - also a very overpriced fish.. Again, the sauce overpowered the fish. And $47 for a piece of fish, not worth it.  Key lime pie 4/5 - it was pretty good, perfect balance of sweet and sour... Great ending to a seafood dinner.",

I loved their attention to details in between meals or clearing the tables as we swipe our table area between meals.  They nailed the View their location, and food choices.

It was to die for! And for the amount of seafood the price was really reasonable! That along with several bites of bread from the delicious bread basket, a few bites of my friend's meal and the birthday dessert they brought out for my friend and I was stuffed! I have also been here for a romantic dinner and sat at one of the booths in more of a dimly lit area and I would highly recommend it for that type of occasion as well.

I've had their fish of the day, petrole sole with capers during my first visit and lobster roll on my second visit. Both were outstanding. Portions were great. There was a lot of Alaskan king crab on the buttery roll. Love the parmesan cheese cracker crisp. That was good. I've had a taste of other dishes at the table. The crab salad was refreshing.

We enjoyed everything we ordered- but the best items that left the hugest impression on me and what I would recommend trying would be the Dover sole and the pie. The Dover sole does not taste fishy and has a very tender and soft texture. I love how your server actually removes the bones and cut it up for you at your table as well. The pie is probably the best pie I have ever had. I am not a huge fan of pie, but after trying Joe's, I always end up craving for more. One is definitely not enough!  Also, the complimentary bread deserves a huge shout out too since I love the variety and how they provide you as much as you want. Our server was delightful! We were seated at a round table out on the indoor front patio. The ambience was very casual and I like how it didn't feel so crowded or noisy. I definitely recommend and would return again!",

I don't personally like oysters, but others from my party said they were really fresh and tasted like the ocean.  The seafood is excellent! We had a seafood platter. Everything on it was great. Of course, we had to get the stone crabs. Cracking and eating is very fun. They will even wash your hands afterwards with lemon!  If you have kids, bring them. Even though it's fine dining, they will have a lot of fun! For $17, kids can get a decent-sized filet mignon, plus a side and a brownie dessert.  It does come out to be expensive, but every penny is worth it. It was an unforgettable meal!",

I could barely hear my parents talk they were so loud. Now I am not about to ruin a person's or a groups good time, bit there comes a point where enough is enough.   I asked our server if something can be done, and they proceeded to try to calm the group down. It wasn't until I went to the manager and told him the situation that we got results. The manager was quick to act and asked the entire group to leave which they did.   Other than that, our server was friendly (a little slow but he could have been dealing with the unruly group) and the food was outstanding. The manager made things right and comped part of our bill due the massive disruption caused by the group. I look forward to coming back to Joe's and experiencing it a second time, without the obscene group antics right in front of our table.",

You can get all cozy and fine dining by sitting inside or choose more touristy, open dining by the seats outside of Joes.   The prime rib is awesome and the pastas with seafood tasted great as well.",

    "text": "This Christmas my mommy and I decided to go hang out in vegas for a couple days as our gifts to each other. This place was recommended by my brother in law for the crab so we decided to try it out. I'm not much of a seafood person but saw skirt steak on the menu so I was sold. The ambiance is beautiful for an anniversary dinner or another special occasion. It was pretty busy so definitely make a reservation. Give yourself time to find the place if you're not from here because we almost lost our reservation trying to find it. Anyway the steak was tasty. My mom had the crab stuffed shrimp which she enjoyed. The bubbles we ordered (can't remember the champagne) were good too. I would definitely recommend for a nice night out on the town. P.s. beware of having a heavy meal if you plan on going out afterwards. It will result in epic failure!",

Host seated quickly without reservation and waiter came right away to take our drink order.  The raw bar food came up quickly but the cooked food took a while to come out, even though Restaurant is pretty empty. So plan enough time for a meal.  Food:  it's a seafood focused restaurant and everything is very fresh.  It's just a little pricey for lunch - Appetizers and salads $15-18, sandwich and pub food $25, seafood entree $39.  We had a dozen very fresh oysters,  stone crabs (the select was plenty big), crab cakes, octopus, fish & chips and fried shrimp.  Everything was very fresh and tasty, the fried items were crunchy, flaky and not oily.    TR reward members get 10% off.  Loved the food, just a little pricey for lunch.",

    "text": "Holy smokes this place deserves 6 stars! There Is a good reason there is almost 2k reviews and it has 4.5 stars!  First off location - in casears first floor by the escalators smart because it's centrally located within the strip! Very convenient.   Service - superb. Our waiter was John he has been there 13 years and was super personable. Recommended items that weren't the most expensive on the menu and even did a suggestion that offered us more food and bang for our buck. Not every waiter does that so I really liked that. He definitely knew what he was doing and the food!  Bread basket was great they offered everything from muffins, rolls, pretzel buns and even crunchy type bread.   I got the seafood platter it included lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp. I hate scallops but husband does and he said they were so moist and fresh. The shrimp was amazing and it was huge - 6 pieces of shrimp alone! The lobster tail was divine! Although it was burnt to a crisp a little.. only bummer of the entire meal which didn't stop me from 5 stars.  The filet was incredible husband got a 12 oz so we split with my platter the steak seasoning they bring you is good pile that stuff on! It definitely adds a spice to the steak in a good way! It was so tender and easy to cut into! Definitely would have gotten the filet next time.  Their mac and cheese is just divine something about the taste of the difference cheeses they gave was delicious we literally cleaned the plate on those.   This was different but they had a side of hashbrowns it's not everyday you see this so we decided to try it and it didn't disappoint. Crunchy on top soft and mushy on bottom just perfection!  We skipped out on dessert because we had huge meals and ate every last bit.   Incredible place quality food and service and very reasonable rate. Visit Joe's!",

The private room they arranged for a party of 14 was perfect. A bit separate and away from the main part of the restaurant but was a great place for the group to really enjoy themselves and not overwhelm other diners. Service was top notch as they seem to have two dedicated servers for our room. Now on to the food. We ordered seafood towers for appetizers which we highly recommend. It allows everyone to try a little bit of clams, stone crabs, king crabs and oysters. The main courses were good portions and in they made sure we had enough sides for everyone. German bacon, sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, all were ordered. We ordered a few bottles of red. All told the cost was extremely reasonable. I would highly recommend this place as an alternative to steak shrines we often go to as part of the guys weekend.",

He walked by our table several times waiting on others and never once checked on us.  Then after we declined dessert (due to his rudeness), it took him 45 minutes to bring us our check.  Unbelievable.  My husband also became very ill for 24 hours after having the seared scallops.  There is no way I would send anyone but my worst enemy to eat at this place.  The treatment from that server is unforgivable.  The food was pretty good, other than the scallops (I especially liked the 'forbidden' Lyonnaise potatoes), but if I could give this place negative stars, I would because of the staff's behavior.  AVOID at all costs.",

The king crab and stone crab are amazing, and the Chilean sea bass is to die for. Patrick was our server and he was super helpful and probably the coolest waiter there is.   This is on the fancier side, but you don't have to wear your nicest suit to eat here. The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable. The prices are not over the roof, you get what you pay for though.  Will definitely be back for sea bass and king crab soon!",

This most recent visit at Caesars did not live up to this establishment's reputation for one reason and one reason alone: the stone crab claws were sub-par mostly because these bad boys are not in season and what was served was probably of the frozen variety which just does not live up to the billing. I would have expected the server to at least have reminded us that this was an off season item so I could take that into account in selecting my entree. Everything else was as good as it always is.",

They had the cutest bread , I mean who makes a miniature loaf of french bread so cute. Our server was Peter Z  . Wow is all I can say he was Amazing.  I think the waiters name was Tony (I think) he was very fun as well.   Back to our food. It was very fresh , I can go on and on.

Plus the service was fantastic , felt like loyalty, they washed our hands with lemon, that was a first. Ask for Patrick, he makes you feel extremely welcomed and important :)  For starters we got the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Alaskan Crab. The shrimp were indeed HUGE! The crab was out of this world fresh and delicious.   Entree: Grilled Seafood Platter, ive never seem such humongous shrimp before, yes bigger than the jumbo cocktail, also included lobster and scallops. Delicious, please be aware this is a huge meal NO SIDES are necessary, we didnt even get to touch ours, so much food in huge portions.   Dessert: Havana Dream Pie... indeed it was a DREAM and I'm not a pie person BUT this pie sold me! The sweetness was just right and the Dulce de Leche syrup was rich in flavor complimenting the pie.   This place WORTH the $$$ BEST VEGAS restaurant thus far!",

    "text": "A friend in the bridal/bachelorette group for Angela T's party hardy weekend suggested this classy, upscale restaurant--famed for the Florida Stone Crabs--located near the Forum Shops entrance from the Las Vegas Strip.  Because this party had 17 voracious vixens, reservations were strongly recommended.  Thus the Maid of Honor booked it over a week in advance, but we were strongly advised that ALL guests must be present in order to be seated.  We thus were chaired onto 2 different tables.  The table I intentionally positioned at had the following proper foods fit for the queen/bachelorette & her feminine minions/comrades:  -Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FrGOhtKrX7e%2F&s=fc08e96a1537dff034b17619be283f8c69390a3df0d3609eddbe698de0f04be9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/p/rGOhtKrX...</a> They'd better be succulent & fresh; otherwise I would've suggested going to those prestigious buffets without hesitation, with precaution of their slightly overly salty condition.  Not to worry (particularly to the PR who may be reading this =P): they were cleanly & lovingly plated to not even crack those sturdy shells ourselves, as I thus reveled at this meatiness, well-balanced sweetness and saltiness--with the zesty touch from the considerately mesh-covered lemon halves & luxurious melted butter.  -Bone-In New York Strip- Coming in 3 beastly, thick pieces (at 20 ounces each), just the essential salt, pepper, and seasoning brought the medium rare steaks to straightforward TLC & deliciousness.  Must I say even more...  -Lyonnaise Potatoes ($10.95)- The menu didn't lie about how shareable it was, even for 9 chicas I sat along with.  Decadent with the utmost creaminess and caramelized onions, I became even more elated that they unintentionally left this tasty carb for this potato-phile.  Besides: what I ate was towards the what-you-partake-on-a-Vegas-bachelorette-night.  -Roasted Sweet Corn ($10.95)- The touch of lime sparked so much bite, savor, and downright ecstasy coming from mine & the girls' faces that another generous order was ensued.  Was it the best I've ever eaten: well in Vegas, oh heck yes.  And we must not forget the...  -Stone Crab Claws- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2Fq8C4UTLX_8%2F&s=03ee3c61efe4426183e38c4f331d40e640ab504142ead719d6c3f620dfc76d1c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/p/q8C4UTLX...</a> If you're completely unfamiliar with this sustainable sustenance, here's what I hope you can imagine.  Oddly meatier and chunkier than the lengthy legs of the king crab or Dungeness crab, at about $7 PER CLAW you're taking into this toothsome and subtly nutty ordeal, complementing with the just the right pinch of zing of their absolutely tolerant horseradish dip.  These too were effortlessly cracked for us to easily scoop up with our forks, whether using the dinner utensil or the fancy toothpick-ish version.  Obviously I wouldn't leave off my take on service: both the host and the server exhibited sheer patience when we were still waiting for a few more lost chicks to arrive.  Additionally our accommodating waitress cheerfully yet calmly helped our table order the right foodstuffs to last throughout the fun night.  The price may still be quite high for the socioeconomically average Millenial, but I expected that especially for presenting great quality.  So make sure you and your partygoers--whatever occasion it is--are prepped up with a luxurious appetite and the most comfortable mode of transaction to spend exquisitely towards their scrumptious Stone Crab claws.  P.S. if you're reading this review at the month of this post, Joe's is serving up their aptly yet benevolently sweet sliced called the Pumpkin Chiffon Pie, which $1 of every slice will proceed to the Susan G Komen (Breast Cancer Research) Southern Nevada.  Just wanted to #pieitforward =)",

Don't remember her name but she's from England. Some highlights:  Pros: 1. High energy and great ambience. 2. Accommodating waitress. I wasn't quite fond of the martini and there was no problem swapping it for another type. 3. Great steak, cooked perfectly well with a nice slab of Alaskan king crab on top. 4. Oysters are a hit and so are their stone crabs.  5. Food is pricey but worth every dime.  Cons: Not much that I can think of but the night we went, there were a lot of older men in groups. So if you're a group of single women, maybe not the best dining place to meet someone. But who cares, go for the food!",

    "text": "FYI: STONE CRAB SEASON IS OCTOBER TO MAY  Just so that there is no confusion for people coming in the off months. Yes this place is a Joe's but it's NOT Joe's Stone Crab in Miami. They are technically not the same restaurant, according to our lovely, and very knowledgeable, waitress.   Either way, it may seem weird to be a place with stone crab in the name and then not have it sometimes. Stone crabs are seasonal though so...the more you know. I don't think this place merits low ratings just because people are not aware of this fact.  Luckily we came right at the start of the season so we had our fill of stone crabs claws and Alaskan king crab legs.  Service here was spectacular and we were seated at the most perfect booth off in the corner. It felt very private and secluded but we were still able to see the whole restaurant and were never ignored by the staff.   Everything was brought out at the perfect time, at the right temperature and we had everything we needed. All the crab was well cracked and easy to eat, and that mustard sauce was as good as I remember it being in Miami.   I would recommend the steaks or the sole with the brown butter sauce. They filet it at the table and it is absolutely delicious.   If you have the bucks and you enjoy fresh seafood, you can't really go wrong at Joe's. I didn't have a bad bite to eat. Even the pretzel bread was amazing!",

We always start our meal with an order of  stone crabs (3 to 4 per person of the medium is plenty) and their seafood salad. I love the spice mix they bring to the table for the steak. I love it so much that when I wanted to make a surf n turf meal for my family, I  emailed them for the recipe and got it. Talk about customer service!  During our last visit, we ordered the tres leches cake and the coconut cream pie. They let you order halfsies so you can try more of them. The tres leches cake is the most delicious dessert I've ever tasted, like ever. Do yourself a favor and book a table, eat and then come back tell me how right I was.",

The crab stuffed shrimp was also delicious and the asparagus was thick and plentful. My boyfriend and I split these 3 dishes and were pleasantly full.  The key lime pie was sweet and bitter at the same time. The Graham cracker crust was perfectly proportionate to the pie filling. And it was the perfect size for 2.

My main was the Dover sole in a brown butter sauce, deboned at the table. One of the tastiest fish dishes I've ever had, and it was also a suggestion from my server.

    "text": "First, let me say this is not a review I ever thought I would write.  We eat at Joe's about once a month, and their food and service have always been outstanding.  For that matter, the food on this last visit was as good as ever and our server was excellent.  Here is what happened.  We were enjoying lunch in the terrace area.  After about an hour, the matre' d came over and asked us to move to the bar, and finish our conversation there, as someone was waiting for the table.  I can honestly say, I have never had anything like this happen to me before, let alone at such an upscale restaurant as this, and after only an hour!   We had salad and lunch, we were not simply sitting enjoying waters and taking up a table.  To his credit, the matre' d did say something to the manager, who came over, and was very apologetic.  The problem was, while she said she was sorry, and he should have never asked us to move, in the next breath she told us we were not the first people that they have asked this of, so obviously he is instructed to do this.  Now, had we ordered next to nothing, had we been there an inordinately long amount of time, been acting inappropriately, or dressed that way, I would understand.  We found this totally unacceptable.   While I love the food, this type of arrogance is not something I am interested in supporting.  No restaurant is this good, in my mind,  Vegas is full of wonderful restaurants.  Until I hear of some changes made in their policies, Joe's has seen the last of us.",

I have tried many dishes over the years, and I have yet to find one that I don't like.  One of my favorites is the Stone Crab Claws.  It might seem pricey, but it's actually reasonable for the quality you get.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  After you park your car in the hotel garage, it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the restaurant, but if you do valet, there is one right by the resto, so you are literally steps away.",

Ok you get bread samples cornbread, flat bread with everything on it and a assortment, next we ordered a order of Stone Crabs and that's one of the things they are famous for. Stone Crab clews are amazing! Then my wife had a fillet mignon and I went for the tuna Ahi fillet under a taste of spinach and a potato circle on the bottom with a brown sauce and mushrooms and this also was amazing, it's the second time I've had that there. We had a side of roasted corn in a nice sauce very tasty. And the server gave us a order of cream spinach out of this world! More yes more dessert at this point we were so stuffed you would have to roll us out of there! But our Beautiful server suggested the cherry pie that is seasonable and of course there is their key lime pie shipped from Florida and they use real key limes and their key lime pie is to die for! So our server said let me get you half and half. Boom sold your amazing  again and again never disappointing! They are downstairs in the forum shops.",

There is also a patio/outside area (a little weird because people that are walking in the casino walk past you and try to see what you're eating), there is also a bar inside.   Pros: service is wonderful, dimly lit, romantic   Cons: can be very loud   Tips: Must try the lobster bisque and the crab cakes! They are a must.   I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Such a beautiful place to have dinner. Perfect for date night! They have the best tasting desserts I've ever had.",

Some brown edges and a small mushroom which didn't stand up to the fish and the sauce. That side of the fish needs a-little work on. Besides that the overall dish was very good and I would order it again minus the subpar side it came with.   Stone crab was flavorful however we got it with the house made cocktail sauce with horseradish. Didn't care for the aioli that it came with. I say this because I'm not sure of the market price at the time I ordered it but seemed alittle pricy. Would I order again? Yes because I love crab.   Service from our server was overall good and he was friendly and witty. I love it when a server engages the table with short bursts of intelligence and wittiness without making pointless conversation to make the table feel awkward. This was not that guy. Made the experience that much more enjoyable.   Ambiance seemed very upscale but being in Vegas you can get away with shorts and T-shirt. Good for date night or celebrating a big Vegas win. Also love the fact their wine list carried my favorite Chardonnay Rombauer.",

Just wanted to point out our experience.   The service was impeccable with great recommendations, even to the wine.   We waited on our food, a little bit more, than even the amazing waiter was expecting but was graciously giving us updates and apologized for it.  Our Caesar salad and crab bisque was on point (definitely recommend it).  Complimentary breads were nice, the baker might of over cooked the pretzel but it was still great.  Once we got our food, that was it, it set the ambience within our table and we were off to bliss.  Thank you staff and thank you cooks!!!  Our Anniversary this year was another home run!",

The atmosphere is very relaxed, perfect for a special occasion evening with no loud music playing in the background or a loud atmosphere.   For appetizers, the king crab legs and stone crab claws are a MUST!!!!! I have never really been a fan of either but omg they are so fresh and delicious especially when you dip it in the melted butter *holy crap.*  My dad got the crab bisque and that was just phenomenal, very rich and tasted very similar to a lobster bisque.   For my entree, I got the rib eye which was just so yummy and tasty! Originally I was going to get the filet because I just wanted something smaller but I also wanted something with more fat. You can't get anything less than 16 oz for the ribeye but they will split it for you and your party which worked out great.   Now for dessert, they do this cool thing where they can half pies. My party and I ordered almost every single half pie there was. My favorite was the coconut cream pie not too sweet and the coconut taste wasn't too strong. The gluten free brownie sundae with vanilla ice cream was just as delicious if you want something more sweet and filling. I was worried it wouldn't be as good because it was gluten free but it was even better!   Service is also phenomenal. Highly recommend this place",

Upon arriving, it seemed unusual to have bar seating for a steakhouse, but maybe a casual vibe is what they were going for? We ordered oysters for appetizers. They tasted fresh but I didn't love finding bits of shell in them. As for the entree, we both had the filet Oscar. The crab meat was delicious! The steak was a little overdone, a medium rare looked more medium. Ehh, I've had better steak. The service was okay, nothing great but nothing extraordinary either. Overall, a disappointing experience. There are plenty of better steakhouses in Vegas and I would go there over Joe's.",

    "text": "Surf n Turf brings together both The Land & Sea on one Plate, Filet Mignon & Lobster, Scallops & Ribeye, Chicken & Shrimp, Pork & Crab (sounds Farfetched but it could possibly work). Our previous visit in Vegas we were invited here for a Food Event but with Dad being at his Classes and me being out and About all day wears on a Person, so we passed. This time it was for our Group Dinner, since all my Suggestions (SW Steakhouse at The Wynn, Sage at Aria and Mesa Grill in Caesar's  Palace) were shot down instantly.  Luckily we didn't have to wait an Hour and a Half like the other night as we all met up in the Lobby and walked right next door to an extremely Packed restaurant filled table to table with business casual wearing Socialites, While heading to our table near the middle of the back I looked at some Photos on the Walls (especially an old photo of Joe's Steak & Seafood from long ago). 6 People were a part of this Meal, me, my Dad, Mike & Martha and Paul & Linda just like its been for the last 4 Group Dinners.  We started off like our usual Group Dinners and ordered Wine and other Various Drinks, I got myself a Sangria which was placed in front of me in a tall glass all Pink & Vibrant, my first sip had my lips slightly pucker as it was Sweet, Tart and Refreshing with some Cherries floating around in it. Our Appetizers consisted of us getting Oysters on the Half Shell, Stone Crab Claws, Jump Shrimp Cocktail and with me getting a Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche. Cold Seafood tossed with Avocado, Red Pepper and Cilantro that was sitting in a light Puddle of Lime Juice that accented the Seafood's Natural Sweetness, the Chips on the side while were Crunchy all the way through crackled under my Molars with every bite were a bit too much.  For our Entrees everyone at the Table were selecting dishes like Chilean Bass, Seafood Platters, Filet Mignon, my Dad ordered Mahi-Mahi over a Carrot Puree with a Grains Salad and topped with an Herb Butter (a very firm fleshed fish but not one of my favorites but he enjoyed it). For my Entree I had the pleasure of ordering Dover Sole and had it prepared for me Tableside just like they did back in the Day. To slowly remove the Bones from the Flesh and then assembled back together again right before my very eyes. with a Brown Butter Sauce swirled around the Plate and with a Lemon on the Side to drizzle over the Delicate Fish. For me to start the meal off with something light (the Ceviche) and to transition into something a little more Heavy with this Fish that had a light brown crust to it.  Everyone decided to get themselves some Dessert, everyone except for me and my Dad. One I was pretty satisfied with what I ate and Two I was not interested as the Desserts menu consisted of nothing but Freshly Baked slices of Pie (too Simplistic). Paul & Linda got themselves a slice of Apple Pie and Mike & Martha got a slice of Key Lime Pie to split. After a group Photo we paid and we were on our way out. I must say I was impressed with the overall progress of the Meal served in a Sophisticated Atmosphere and just to have the Craftsmanship of the Meat or Seafood shine without too many Techniques or other ingredients embellishing them. I don't need Red Lobster to make me Seafood Differently as I've gotten a firsthand experience at some Great Quality.",

    "text": "We are huge fans of Joe's: 2 meals in two days. It's our new go-to spot for sure.  I'd recommend trying the Clevelander gin based drink with citrus tones- excellent cocktail. The bread basket is also really fantastic. Everything in the basket is superb- ask for sides of pecan butter with your bread basket and thank me later.   I went with the Seafood Pasta and my wife chose the Filet Mignon. It was the best pasta dish I've ever enjoyed. I immediately realized & could taste that indeed the noodles were freshly homemade. The basil pesto sauce was unbelievable, and the dish was loaded with huge chunks of juicy lobster, succulent shrimp, and two large crab claws.  My wife and and I have been lucky to eat at some great prime steakhouses over the years and in Vegas too and we both agreed this filet was simply the best we've ever tasted. It was buttery smooth snd what gave it an edge was the slightly crispy sear.   The steamed lemon sparagus was perfect with a small scoop of sea salt and ground pepper provided.  And of course dessert.. We opted to do 2 half slices and were glad to be able to try the Peanut Butter pie (rich and smooth) and the Banana Cream pie which was a slice from heaven. We are already looking forward to trying Joe's again next year...",

    "text": "Joe's was one of many stops of our food-centric Vegas trip and we were fully intent on getting a fix of their famous stone crabs before we left.  We went a little overboard with the ordering and ended up getting filet mignon, mashed potatoes, seafood cobb, and an order of their stone crabs (they only had the smallest size that day).   The stone crabs came out first and they were everything we expected and more!! So fresh and meaty - they paired well with the tartar sauce but we requested some melted butter to dip them in as well. I was also very happy with the seafood cobb, which came with a generous portion of a variety of fresh seafood. The filet was rather disappointing. Meat was of decent quality but it was poorly seasoned and bordered on bland. Mashed potatoes were good but we weren't crazy about the breadcrumbs on top.   Service was prompt although the rest of the food took some time to come out. Will definitely have to be back for those stone crabs though!",

    "text": "Joes seafood, prime steak and stone crab is located in Caesars palace, at the end of the forum shops. I highly recommend valet parking since the valet is right in front of Joes.  Made reservations about a week in advance and were glad we did! There was a convention going on that Wednesday night and Joes ended up having a line out the door with an hour wait per table  As soon as we arrived we walked up to the host table at the front, and were then instructed to go into the restaurant to the other host stand by the coat check and check in. There are so many tables in the dining room that it can be somewhat difficult maneuvering around, however we were luckily sat at a lovely, private booth along the wall.   Service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly. She had great recommendations and frequently checked in on us. Also every diswe ordered came out really fast! Kudos to the kitchen and waitstaff for speedy deliveries.   The atmosphere was great. A little noisy, but it still had a very dressy feel. The servers and hosts were all wearing suits and the lighting was dim and romantic. Wood floors and snazzy music finish off the feel. The only downside is the restrooms are located up the stairs, around the corner and down the hall-quite the trek, but it is a big restaurant.   My friend and i ordered a few rounds of simple drinks (an IPA and a Prosecco), but the main highlight, was the food!  The stone crab to be exact. An order comes in either medium, select, or large. We asked the server which to get and she recommended the select, since they all weigh the same, but the select and the large actually contain more crab meat for the weight. When the order finally came, it was outstanding. The thick crab legs came pre-cracked and ready to eat. My friend, who is a crab enthusiast, LOVED THEM. He didn't even use any of the sauce that it came with!  I also ordered two orders of raw oysters; the Kusshi and the kamamoto. Although very fresh and delicious, the size and price were a little disappointing. I had eaten at the 24 hour oyster bar at the plaza station the night before and in comparison, these oysters were a little underwhelming.  To finish off our heavy seafood meal, we then ordered two Caesar salads and called it a night. Also, on a side note, the complimentary bread that Joes gives out it is DELICIOUS. The variety had a jalapeno cornbread, Parmesan black pepper lavoshe, pretzel buns, rye bread and raisin bread.   If you're down to spend a pretty penny and enjoy some amazing crab, along with other great seafood, and service, then Joes is your place!",

    "text": "Make sure you have a reservation. We dined here on a Monday night in cold February, and even with a reservation, our wait was over 20 minutes.   Once in the coveted dining room, we were like 2 stowaways on the titanic, unnoticed and awkward, as we watched all the action around us, waiters running back and forth.   Finally! After a long stretch the server, not the waiter mind you offered us water. Then came the free bread basket, well, with these prices , free don't matter, really.   Our waitress, finally arrives, mutters words out the side of her mouth like a 30s style speak easy sister. It all happens so fast, I felt lost in translation. What just happened? I guess she'll be back with my fiancees cherry coke and my Cabernet. Is that what happened after we declined the house day special Rock Lobster from Mexico, yo?   So, after, minutes pass, and I mean, minutes are passing by sister. The coke arrives with no cherry flavor see. Minutes pass again as I crunch through my wedge salad with blue cheese and bacon. Yes, bacon, brother. Maybe 15 minutes into my salad, and about 20 minutes from the point that I ordered a glass of Cabernet, I flag down sister sledge, our waitress, and told her im hammering for that red wine yo. She says, I'll bring it, and I say, what bout the cherry flavoring in my fiancees coke yo? She says, in her speak easy , quick muttering-out the side of her horn, I'll bring that too. Man, it's hectic, here. So basically the whole night went as such. The aged New York my fiance had was a 3 star slab of meat. My 6 oz filet was also a 3 star disappointment, it also was rare, I ordered medium.   Joes stone crab did not live up to its old school aura of hospitality and service, much less quality of steak. Very disappointed we spent so much on valentines week at Joes. Next time in Vegas, we may have to return to Kraft steak or Oldfields.",

    "text": "Best. Meal. Ever.  Our service was a British lady who was very long winded with thorough stories and explanations of every item and especially the crab and different kinds of oysters. She was fun and polite.  Pros: Food was incredible. All the oysters were delicious, my first time having stone crab and it was succulent and amazing. Steaks were cooked absolutely perfectly and delicious. Sides were all fresh and plentiful. Creme Brule was outstanding. Not a single thing to complain about. Refills came quickly, ambiance was nice, service was top notch and what you'd expect from a fine dining establishment. Joe's has it's own Valet separate from the main Forum shops so make sure you find it and use it.  Cons: Price? But, you understand you're going to a fine dining steakhouse so if you aren't prepared to laid down a couple hundred, you're an idiot.  Will definitely go again for another special occasion.",

    "text": "After and unimpressive dinner at another place, we were looking forward to some great food and weren't let down in the least.  The service was excellent from the start. We had a preset menu so ordering was only for the entree and desert.  The Caesar salad dressing was the best I've had. It just made the salad amazing. The string beans amandine were excellent as well. They had a slight buttery taste but not overwhelming and were cooked perfectly.  I got my filet and it was perfectly seasoned & cooked (medium). Absolutely succulent and tender. I think others were so used to not getting a perfectly cooked steak that they ordered a different temperature to make up for it but ended up with exactly what they asked for.  I had assumed the filet was a larger portion but since it was smaller decided to add on lobster tail. I apologized for the last minute change (we had all been served the entrees at this time) and asked if I could add it on. The server came back once to tell me that it would be out shortly. When it finally showed up they apologized even though it was my mistake. That's an A+ for service.  The lobster tail was cooked perfectly. I shared a little with others who were under the same opinion.  Now for desert. I ordered a cappuccino (they use Lavazza) and the apple pie. The server wasn't joking about saving room for desert. The portion was huge. It was possibly one of the best apple pies I've tasted (and I know my apple pies since they're my favorite). Some of the apple slices were slightly under-cooked. These were thinly sliced apples not the larger chunks. But there were only a few like that and the rest made up for it.  Overall a great food and dining experience. Great news that they are coming to DC (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bizjournals.com%2Fwashington%2Fblog%2F2013%2F05%2Fjoes-seafood-prime-steak-stone.html&s=e213134d6b0ec642fa26938b421f865fcfb4eb10a62f143336c7b91ba1f6d25e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bizjournals.com/washingt...</a>).",

It was our first time having those and it was just awesome!  Ask for more than 1 lemon slice...make sure to spritz the lemon on the claws for a better experience. Make sure you get the small fork to fork out the crab meat..we got our towards the end..I wondered how to eat this..like a barbarian? Hahah but it's better to eat it with your hands. Oh the horseradish mayo sauce thing was good too.  The key lime pie was great too! It's a must to order.",

    "text": "A must place to eat if you love steak and seafood and visiting Vegas.  We made a reservation several weeks in advance on open table given recommendations from previous Yelpers and the fact that we were dining on Easter Sunday. It was very busy, so we were glad made the reservations. The service is top-notch from time of arrival.  We ordered their famous stone crab claws (which comes with a side of mustard aioli for dipping) and the crab bisque soup as an appetizer.  I had their bone-in Halibut special which was a huge portion and divine!  My wife had the seared ahi Tuna which was also a large portion and fantastic.  Between the fresh bread that comes with dinner and our delicious appetizers we couldn't even finish our main dishes.  Unfortunately we didn't have room for their home-made pies but they looked good from our view of others ordering them.  Dinner for two of us including one glass of wine was about $160 not including tip.  Our only disappointment was that we specified when making reservations that is was our wedding Anniversary and didn't even receive a small complimentary dessert acknowledging our anniversary (most high-end restaurants will serve you a smaller sample dessert for birthdays/anniversaries). However, our dining experience was still excellent and highly recommend a visit for anyone who will be close to the Caesar forum shops in Vegas.",

The great service started even before we stepped in the restaurant.  I changed my reservation twice and showed up early, but the host was so nice and made a joke about it and seated us right away.  And our waiter was sooo nice and patient.  Being our first time here, the waiter took his time and patiently answered our questions and recommended what to order.  It took us fooorever to look at the menu and order.  But the waiter was so nice -- he kept checking up on us to make sure we are ready to order without rushing us.  We ordered family style, 4 large rock crab claws and a seafood chopped salad.  They split the salad without extra charge and made each plate look very nice.  Anyway, on with the food:  (Actually, before the main dishes: The complimentary bread basket -- so fresh and addicting that I had to control myself from eating too much of it so I have room for the actual meal!)  Rock crab claws:  Wow, I loved it! So fresh, sweet and juicy! I guess this place isn't famous for its claws for nothing! Each claw was huge and had so much meat and I think 2 claws per person is the perfect amount.  And they go perfectly with Joe's mustard sauce. It's so worth the $$!   Seafood chopped salad:  Delicious salad! All the seafood - lobster, crab, shrimp - in the salad are also sooo fresh and sweet. It was so light yet so satisfying!  And because we were too full we didn't order dessert, but the waiter surprised us with a complimentary dessert -- brownies and ice cream!  And yes, we made room for dessert and it was a great way to finish a wonderful meal!  Overall, it was a fantastic experience.  Can't wait to go back again next time I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Horrible front of house experience   We arrived a bit early for our reservation. We politely told the gentleman at the desk that we were a few minutes early. He barked at us to go to the bar and have a drink. We walked into the bar area but it was heaving with people eating from bar tables. It seems clear that the tables in the bar were set for diners, not people waiting on a dinner reservation just having drinks. The bar stools were all filled. We asked a passing wait staff if it was all right to sit at one of these tables and her response was equally rude: no these are all reserved, go ask the maitre'd. We then asked someone in a suit where we could get a drink and he barked at us, waved his arm dismissively in a general direction and said \"go ask the bartender\". No one was gracious or helpful. Only rude like they didn't care about customer experience.   Very off-putting first impression. I guess because they are popular and fully booked they feel they can afford to treat customers with disrespect. And this was before we even got seated!  Every staff interaction was rude.  At this point my husband, who is normally a very mild mannered person, was starting to lose it.  I dragged him outside into the shopping mall where we waited. We discussed not going back in.   We presented ourselves again at the appointed time of our reservation and were quickly seated in a very pleasant corner booth. Our server asked us, perhaps rhetorically, how we were doing this evening and we were honest with him about our earlier experience.   While the food was pleasant, and plentiful, it was not extraordinary. We weren't concerned with price so much, we knew from previous visits that the place is expensive.  Our server was experienced, knowledgeable and professional.   A glass of wine that we ordered was corked. We brought this to the server's attention, he sniffed it, and he agreed. But by the time we got his attention, the meal was over.   At the end of the meal, after the check was presented and the credit card was taken away, the manager approached the table and said he wanted to hear more about our earlier experience. We are polite people but we were candid. He expressed surprise that we were treated this way.  Usually, at this point, in our experience, management would make some gesture of contrition and compensation. But none was offered. This reinforced our belief that Joe's won't try to make it right and doesn't care if a customer walks away with a negative experience.   It's difficult for us to recommend this restaurant.",

I don't like the flour dusted layer on them. I loooooove the taste of scallops, and felt it took away from the great flavour. But otherwise everything else at the table was soooo gooood!  My Mom had the dover sole, which had tremendous table side service. They fileted the fish right at the table, and not a single bone to be found!  Great wine list too!  We reserved through Open Table and very lucky we did! The place was rammed by 5:30pm! Definitely recommend reservations!",

Lunch and dinner menu are almost the same, except dinner costs about 40% more than lunch.  I would recommend coming here for lunch instead. Gets busy but not too packed.  Our server was friendly and constantly made sure to check up on us frquently.  Their complimentary assortment of bread is BOMB. Sad to say that the bread was the best thing here.  Kumamoto Oyster You can never go wrong with this type of oyster. Super small, but fresh. Slightly sweet taste.  Fanny Bay Oyster These are a typical type of oyster. A little bit on the more bitter side.  Beausoleil Oyster It was my first time trying these and the server said they are on the saltier side, and personally I did think these were the best ones, like she said.  Filet Mignon Seak We requested for medium rare, it was cooked more medium, rather than rare. It was super dry.  Grilled Seafood Plate (Madagascar Shrimp, Lobster Tail, Scallops) The shrimp were HUGE and they were pretty good, but very dry. The lobster was also very very dry. And the scallops were over cooked and dry.  Basically almost everything was too dry. Not worth it.",

We ordered the stone crab of course, but I actually enjoyed the king crab more. We also ordered steak and lobster tail. We said next time we come back we are sticking too the king crab. They bring it to your table and cut it before they set it on the table.   We came back on our 4th year anniversary and this time is was a weekend. Apparently, a busy weekend. Service wasn't as great as it was the first time. Maybe because it was so busy.  I understand it being a longer wait time, but the service was just OK. Our server was nice but the girl that brought out the wine was not. She ruined the rest of my experience. I know never to come on a weekend again. I even said I don't want the wine anymore. The server ended up bringing out 2 glasses of champagne anyway. That was a nice gesture even though I didn't feel like having it anymore.   Even with this bad experience the second time around, I would still come back. I just hope I won't have to see that girl that brings out the wine ever again. I'm giving 5 stars because of my first experience. Plus, the food is phenomenal.",

    "text": "Had came here for dinner with some good friends after two had been wanting to come here since the later half of last year. Originally we loved going to SW steakhouse but they had recently increased their prices of our favorite rib-eye by almost $20, it was time to consider another place to try. One of our friends was coming to town with his girlfriend to attend a bachelorette party, so on the first night, before people arrived, we had gotten together for dinner. Reservations were made for 7 pm and apparently are dealt with separately from the front/bar areas. Majority of the party was a bit late but we were promptly sat at the far back dining room as soon as we arrived to check in at the other counter, inside the restaurant. I had originally thought the restaurant was a bit small, with a seating area outside, bar area, and maybe another dining room upstairs but little did I know, besides the areas noted, there were 2 more dining rooms in the back, and supposedly banquet/party style rooms upstairs.  Our waitress had came to us almost immediately as soon as we sat down and had told us about the specials while serving us two baskets of bread. The bread baskets included a few slices of raisin bread, a type of cracker (never know what these are actually called), pretzel bread, and a surprisingly moist and soft but sweet corn bread.   One of the main items this restaurant is known for is the stone crabs. The stone crabs is a sustainable food item where they are heavily controlled and harvested only within specific size requirements. Best thing is, the crab stays alive and can regrow the claw after its removed. The crab claws at this restaurant are harvested from the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.   The stone crabs are served as a cold appetizer with a light mustard-type of sauce. Prices are as follows as of 03/17/17. Medium (7 per order - $40), Select (6 per order - $50), Large (5 per order - $70). Between 4 of the 6 people in our party, we had ordered 2 orders of the \"select\" size, by recommendation of the waitress for being the \"best deal and most commonly ordered\" and easily sharable due to the even quantity.   Flavor-wise, to be honest, I really don't know why these are \"better\" than any other crab. Clean tasting with its natural sweetness. Texture-wise, its fairly similar to other crabs. Less \"stringy\". If anything, my complaint would be they cracked it too much and it was a pain in the butt cleaning the shells off before eating.   Prior to coming here, I had a problem deciding on what to order, besides the crab.   There was a lot of sharing with our party. Sharing between 2 people. The couples shared amongst themselves, of course. By suggestion of the waitress stating their bone in filet is a signature item, I guess that's what I was getting.   The bone-in signature prime steaks are hand-carved by butchers in house and aged for 24 days priced at $57.95 for 16 oz. The size of the filet was pretty big and the bone was fairly small. I never knew you could do bone-in for filet's and I've always seen filet's extracted as a whole tenderloin, mainly either as a filet or as a chateaubriand. Typically I never order filet mignon or buy it but as it was a recommended signature dish, I decided to try it, as I usually cook rib-eye's a lot. The filet has a great crust. For a signature dish, I actually had thought they'd do an amazingly perfect cook with minimal gradient. I've never cooked filet so I can't say from experience but I know its difficulty. Seasoned really well and as said before, great crust. The center was a very cool and pink, almost closer to rare than medium rare. Great flavor from seasoning and the meat itself. When i got closer to the center of the steak, i had to use the provided side seasoning salt, but very minimal. Best filet ive had (not saying much since I haven't had much hahaha)   Double-cut Colorado lamb chops w/ mint chimichurri ($57.95) - this is what my friend ordered. As we were sharing, we had split halfsies on our orders. The order is almost like a full rack of lamb chops with the cuts at a borderline 3 bone cut. They state as double-cut because they cut so close to the bone on the outside bones. Paired with a great chimichurri sauce and a grilled lemon, it brings a bright flavor to the dish. Like the filet, great meat flavor and seasoning. Totally been craving chimicurri sauce lately too. One of the chops I had, the center was definitely raw-rare. Oh well xD better than overcooking my chop lol  Overall, not bad in terms of meat. Crab claws, may be over-hyped and over-priced. At least i tried it once. Would like to try their rib-eye maybe if I were to return.",

Unfortunately, we only stayed in Florida for 2 days so I didn't get a chance to try it. Going to Vegas, I had to bookmark Joe's. We went for dinner and it was beyond what I expected. The food was delicious and our server was exceptional. I ordered the medium stone crab claws. My husband ordered a lobster dinner (forgot everything he had) and fresh corn. I truly enjoyed the stone crab-they are served cold but I asked to have mine heated a little. Since it was the first time I've ever had stone crab, I did not know what too expect. They were not sweet nor did they taste like snow crab or king crab-they are a completely different taste and texture. But in a good way.  What I could not get enough of was the fresh corn. I am not sure what blends of seasonings they put on them but they were amazing! I couldn't stop eating them.  Our server was pretty awesome too, he gave great recommendations and he gave us a generous military discount but I don't remember his name. I would recommend this place to anyone.",

Other than that the food was excellent. My husband ordered the bone in filet which was probably one of the best steaks we have ever had. I ordered the potato crusted flounder (I think it was a special that night) and that was very good. We got the mashed potatoes as a side which were very good but didn't compare to the pan roasted corn our server brought us complimentary; it was out of this world. Next time I would skip the appetizer and potatoes as the portions are large. We didn't have any room left for dessert unfortunately bc they sounded delicious.",

For an appetizer we had the cerviche which had a good flavor for cerviche, it was a bit more acidic then I like but it was still tasty.  The tuna was fabulous.  It was cooked rare to perfection which I find is very difficult to get.  We also tried the crab stuff sole which was good but I thought it needed more crab. For dessert we shared the apple tart which had taste and was a nice way to end the meal because it wasn't too heavy.",

The dining room is one of those wood-paneled jobs, and it is manned by waiters in black ties and tuxes. A wonderful \"old school\" environment. I truly forgot that I was in a fake Roman mall. The service provided by the wait staff was unparalleled. It is great to be in the hands of real professionals. Yes, he's made those suggestions a thousand times, but such polish comes from commitment as well as experience.  Oh yeah, the food was great to. Fish cooked just right, tasty stone crabs, crunchy salads not over-whelmed by dressing and marvelous roasted corn (a spot-on recommendation.)

Creamed spinach, roasted corn, and a potato dish our server recommended.  Wow what a meal and the service was great.  We didn't have room for desert, however they brought out a brownie with ice cream for my Bday. Now with that being said tis the season for holiday deserts so of course we had to order some to go.  Traditional Key Lime Pie, pumpkin chiffon pie and sweet potato pecan pie were all a must.  Love Joes!",

She brought me the bone-in filet and WOW! Cooked to perfection and delicious. For my husband, the seafood lover, Leann brought out a platter of Mediterranean shrimp, Alaskan King Crab, and an amazing crab cake.

    "text": "OK, this is a review for their seafood - as I've never eaten steaks there before.  I used to love this restaurant. The last time I was in Vegas, I stayed for 3 month - I take a long vacation every year,,, about 2 years ago. I went to Joe's probably 5 times to eat king/stone crabs and shrimps and such. It was amazing. 5 stars back then.  This time I have been staying in Vegas for over 2 month already, eating out everyday and night - spending a lot of $$$$. Sadly enough, I have found quality of Vegas restaurant business has gone pretty bad. Maybe it's because of the depression. Maybe they've found easier way to get more money - like night club. Well, whatever the reason was, I decided to go to Joe's to refresh myself,,,, hopefully not to waste money anymore.  Service - Outstanding. They are the professionals.  Atmosphere - 3 stars as always. Not so special but it is all ok with me.  Food -   Crabs - Not good anymore. They are pretty much tasteless. I don't know what happened to them. Simply tasteless. Not worth eating it even if it's $5.  Ceviche - Terrible. It was amazing last time, tho, this time it was like stuffing out of a cheap seafood taco made by hole in the wall type of place in LA. They don't even use cilantro and red onion. They made it with some sort of salsa. Shrimps and scallops didn't have any flavor. They were just chewy thing without any taste. TERRIBLE.  Lobsters - flavorless again. It doesn't even smell like a lobster.   Oysters - It is OK. 2 years ago, it was MUCH BETTER, tho.  We have to walk away as soon as we finished drinking wines. All we order was just appetizer - ended up paying more than $100 for these small items.   I was gonna rate it 3 stars for the service, but no,,,, I have to be honest because I don't want you to be disappointed. Don't get crabs and shrimps this year (they were saying it was very seasonal, fresh, and good. Turned out to be pretty crappy). Maybe next year, they may able to find good seafood.   I was looking forward to eating here for a while - so it was VERY disappointing.",

I was having a really bad day, I lost my ID in the convention somewhere, and hadn't had much sleep since it was a work event and we were all up late taking care of presentation stuff. As soon as we got to the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman that didn't mind chatting with us while he waited for someone to show us to our table (we had reservations). Our server was amazing, pleasant and on top of it. We started off with the fried calamari, my friend got the filet mignon and I chose the crab cakes. This was THE best meal I've ever had and my friend agreed. The fried calamari was light and not greasy, the crab cakes had big chunks of crab and lots of flavor, and the filet was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The meal turned my bad day around and ending it with the Havana cake was the best! We are thinking of taking a weekend trip to Vegas just so we can go back to Joe's. Thank you for saving my day!",

I opted for a 22 oz Ribeye without the bone, and I must admit that this steak was in the top two of \"the most delicious steaks I have ever eaten\". It was tender, juicy, just the right amount of pink in the middle, but the taste of it took my taste buds to a new level of enjoyment. Coincidentally, everyone else at the table could not stop praising their food as well. I do also want to mention our waiter, who's been there for a long time, and for a good reason, too. He was attentive, quick, and kept the transition between courses seamless. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. One, which I hope to repeat soon.",

The crispy Brussel sprouts had no seasoning, the potatoes au gratin were undercooked by a lot, and the final blow---a sea of oil floating on top of my coffee.  Cafeteria service and a complete lack of enthusiasm and love of food  by servers and managers.  APATHY in abundance and poor quality of food can be expected.  My least favorite Las Vegas dining experience in 40 years!",

I had the grilled fisherman's platter. Getting a dish like this tells you alot about the quality of their seafood. There's no sauces, seasonings, or extra flavors to hide behind. Just cooked fish and maybe a little butter and lemon. Well, it wasn't good, the seafood wasn't fresh, and it wasn't properly cooked either.  Onto the roasted chicken. Somehow it was dry and greasy at the same time. I guess I shouldn't have gotten a chicken dish at a seafood restaurant.  Service was pretty excellent, but the food was a letdown. Stick with the stone crabs I guess, and you probably won't be disappointed.",

Everything was superb except the Chowder was Manhattan style and not New England style. I normally like both styles but I couldn't finish the chowder as it was a little spicy and it marred the generally good flavor. It tasted more like New Orleans style. We are both looking forward to our next visit to try the Crab Legs. Try it - you'll love it too!!",

My mother and I wanted to split our steak.  They did this for us and that was very nice of them.  The steak was so yummy, my family also split the mac and cheese DELICIOUS, the fried brussel sprouts which were good and super unique, and a baked potato, which melted in my mouth.      The best part of the night was our server Erica, she brought my parent a brownie and ice cream dessert as a Happy Anniversary gift.  We playful asked her where the candle was, she laughed.  Then we also ordered the banana cream pie, when she came back with the pie she had put a candle in the top.  It was awesome and made the night even more special.  The pie was so good, OMG, I want to go back for that alone.  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try this place for years.  Always passing by it on our way to Casa Fuente.  We decided to finally try this place and we weren't all that impressed.  We called to make a reservation, but they said they didn't have any openings til after 9.  They also said that we could try and do a walk-in.  So we headed down there and decided to walk-in.  We were seated immediately.  It is a very nice place and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  We were seated near an area where some guests were waiting for their tables and were pretty much standing next to our table.  Our waitress seemed very nice and informative about the menu.  Service of the bread and meal was pretty good.  The downside was that they were very slow at refilling our water.  I had the Bone-In Rib Eye 24 oz. $59.95.  It was something that I wasn't blown away with.  The steak seemed a little tough and didn't have a lot of flavor.  It also had a big chunk of fat on it.  I don't mind some fat on my steak, but this was a pretty big piece.  I would think a place of this quality wouldn't have served something like that.    My cousin had the Stone Crab and he wasn't impressed with that either.  He felt it was lacking flavor as well.  We also had some mashed potatoes and the creamed spinach.  We weren't fans of this either.  Maybe we caught them on a bad day.  I really doubt we will come back.",

Jose S. was truly good with kids, he engaged in conversation with them. He was very honest when he saw our bill was charged an upfront gratuity which was meant for larger parties. We love the honesty in him! He worked attentively and enjoyed what he do. Thanks Jose S and everyone who took care of our table in such a crazy season in Las Vegas!",

I seriously doubt it I sold meat for several years and this was nowhere near Prime grade., It was tough., Crab cakes were okay the only problem was is like solid crab and no breading so is like crab pressed together.... I could not finish my meal so I get it to go... What horrible Packaging they did not give me the sauce for my crab cakes and I can't heat it up in the aluminum foil paper wrapping.",

We shared the Whale, some fried green tomatoes, and the broccolini, I had a watermelon margarita and he had a beer. Everything was amazing right down to the bread basket. We finished with the key lime pie, which was rich enough that we couldn't finish it between the two of us.  Second night: My husband had the steak Oscar, I had the grilled seafood platter, we split some grilled tomatoes, he had another beer and I tried the mojito (which was delicious). Again, everything was perfectly done, timely, and well presented.   Tip: Although I indulged in some seafood I did note that they have a vegan/veggie menu with several tasty looking options!",

AWESOME!   i ordered the stone crab lunch special (5 medium claws, hash browns, cole slaw, and key lime pie) and the calamari.  The calamari was delish! always a good appetizer!  at first, i was unsure if the stone crabs would fill me up bcuz i have an unusually large appetite.   after the appetizer, bread, crab, and dessert, i was stuffed!  the crab had such good flavor and did not need any sauces.  the hash browns and cole slaw were mediocre but who goes to this restaurant for hash browns and cole slaw?!  the 2nd best part of my meal was the key lime pie!

My wife, on the other hand, had a somewhat mixed experience, with the stone crabs. They were very good, but they had \"over\" cracked them. There were minute pieces of shell, that had been embedded in the meat, making every bite, an adventure. Other tahn that, she enjoyed them. We laso shared a chopped salad and the mac and cheese, and finished with the key lime pie. All in all, a very enjoyable meal.",

They might be more \"rare\" or hard to get....but it all comes down to the taste and price. Why pay for more if you can get something \"very similar\" for much less.",

I had a crab bisque, and my fellow eaters had a shrimp dish and an ahi dish .  We were all happy with that part.  It was the cocktail issue that had me like ... what?  In most places, bar, restaurant, arenas, wherever, when you order a double, you pay more.  Duh, makes sense.  But in VERY few places if any, does a double LITERALLY mean double the price.  Ask the people at the Cirque shows who will sell you a single cocktail for 12 or a MONSTER for 18.  Anyway, the point is, had the waitress been clear, we would have had no issue.  But when you say, \"You want a double?  You only pay a little more,\" you are misleading your customers.  One thing is 12 to 18; another is when you pay $1 under twice the amount for a double.  Really?  Who you fooling there?  I repeat, had you been clear on this whole thing, then it would have been up to us to take it or leave it, but don't mislead your guests with such nonsense.  At the end of the day, I can drink cheaper and better in 10,000 other places in Las Vegas.  Markup on wine and liquor at a place like this is expected, but that is just ridiculous.",

    "text": "The BF and I enjoyed a post-Christmas dinner at Joe's this past Sunday with close friends Jolene L. and Rob C., as well as Rob's brother Russ and their mom, Diann.   Without a doubt I'd been looking forward to our 5pm reservation for a couple of weeks...   Our waiter was a nice fella whose name escapes me...but he'd no doubt made a career for himself on knowing the specials and knowing them well. A little bit snoot, but still a whole lotta nice.   We ordered drinks and I decided on one of the fancy schmancy specialty cocktails called \"Daddy's Key Lime Pie\" - a yummy concoction that yes - tastes like liquid Key lime pie and no doubt could turn deadly very quickly... (No wonder the recipe is top secret!) All I know is it's made with Skyy Vodka, half & half or some other cream, I'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. Bottoms Up! It was deeeelicious.   Before I forget, too, I have to mention the bread basket! There is the OMGAH cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. I LOVES it!!!  Even though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. In fact, I ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because I didn't think I was hungry enough to justify that and an entree. However, once I caught sight of the Jumbo Crab Cake I knew I couldn't resist.  That Jumbo Crab Cake was SO GOOD... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. It practically melted in my mouth! The next time I'm at Joe's I'm going to order the Jumbo Crab Cake dinner. (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!)  Rob & Jolene ordered the 2nd Mortgage, an appetizer that lives up to its name! A plate of Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Alaskan King Crab, and a Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche.  I tried some of the ceviche and it was flavored so nicely...light with just the right amount of acidity with chunks of scallops and shrimp... very, very good.   Now... the main course...   I knew IMMEDIATELY that I wanted the Bacon-wrapped Scallops. Have you seen them? Oh my goodness! TEN scallops in total; served in a \"pair\" of five since they are wrapped in bacon... oh my goodness...oh my goodness... heavenly! I could only eat five of them which worked out perfectly for me since I had leftovers for dinner last night! The scallops are fantastic. I didn't much care for the bacon itself but the flavor the bacon gave the scallops was FANTASTIC and they were perfectly cooked.   For sides I ordered the Pan Roasted Sweet Corn, which I absolutely loved, and the Deep Fried Asparagus. How could I resist it? Even our waiter made a comment that they took a perfectly healthy vegetable and umm... made it unhealthy... and it was divine! Good thing the sides are generous in portion and can be shared easily between a party of even four, I'd say...  I tried the Garlic Creamed Spinach, also, and it was nice... but the Asparagus was the clear front runner.   After our leftovers were boxed up, we ordered coffee... I really wanted dessert...but I had no room whatsoever. I was so stuffed I even considered for a second, sprinting to the opposite end of the Forum Shops to H&M to purchase a pair of elastic waistband pants... *tee hee*   Two in our party of six did order dessert... I had a bite of both the Key Lime Pie and the Havana Dream Pie... which, oh yes... was certainly that. Both were decadent... I woulda needed a pair of elastic waistband pants AND a couch (a stretcher? and two strong mens?) had I indulged in a whole piece.  It was a lovely meal... with great friends that are near and dear to me... and a great send off for 2010...   I know we're not QUITE there yet...but I don't see another $30 entree a'happenin for me before Friday so... there you go.",

Scallops were lightly fried (this is really just a way to hide that you can't cook scallops right).   The mushroom stuffed spinach was mushy and hard to eat.  The potatoes had hard parts and were overcooked.   We ate at 5 places that were \"destination\" style places and this was the worst.     Finally, \"Joe\", our waiter, was more interested in serving the table of 20-30 people (even though it wasn't his table) than making sure we had our bottle of wine poured (we got a busser to do it).   Why would I server need to pour our wine?  It was a bottle of white that they didn't keep chilled tableside but instead near the center column 40 feet away from us.  It was a poor experience.

    "text": "My 2nd time here. I recommend their stone crab. This time I ordered 6 blk medium stone crabs $40 again as an order. We asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! They pre cracked it for us prior to serving which I thought was nice. We only had to peel the shells off easily.   They gave us salt and pepper on the side for the stone crab and complimentary bread when first seated.  The bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread.   Also ordered the 24 oz. Bone-in Ribeye $60 It was juicy, tender, and flavorful. I asked for medium well. It was delicious. This serves 2 people so I shared this also with an order of the stone crab and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entrees was enough.   Their Jenny Mash Potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. It was also good. No complains.  With tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . Not bad for a dinner date.  My only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. Also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. The Lyonnais and the Jenny Mash. Hmm I would expect them to be more helpful.   Its okay, I would still come back for the great food!  _______________________________________________  The 1st time I came here, feeding 3 people including me, we had ordered one order of stone crab (6), crab legs   An order of \"seafood platter\" with sea bass, scallops, clams, and baby octopus, it tasted so good.   And an order for asparagus on the side and salmon with grilled onion mash potatoes.",

This place didn't just ruin any other seafood restaurant for me, but more like ALL restaurants hahahaha  The table enjoyed a few bottles of Chardonnay and the bread baskets to start. It's not your typical bread, the bread here makes Texas Roadhouse rolls look like the bread you feed ducks at a lake. There's thin crispy bread, cheesy bread, buttery warm rolls, etc. all complimentary!   I enjoyed the swordfish (YUMM) and shared a Mac n cheese side with my friend. All 9 of us were raving about the food the whole time.   This was one of the best meals I've ever had. Perfect dinner before walking over to Omnia to dance my pants off. Come here dressed to the 9s and ready to splurge a little bit and you will leave happy!!! Thank you Joe whoever you are!",

I could have ordered them for my entree and been happy. Even my oyster-avoiding husband liked them.   I love going to restaurants I haven't been to before but I'm HORRIBLE at deciding what I want. I finally decided on the seafood pasta here and was happy enough. The lobster, crab, and shrimp in the dish were to die for but I wasn't crazy about the pasta itself. If I were to go back, I would probably go with the crab cakes that sounded wonderful.   My husband got the rib eye and absolutely loved it.   We got the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it, too, was great. I liked the ice cream better than the pie, though. This particular pie is the special pie for the month and for every slice ordered, they donate $1 to a food bank/charity - it doesn't get much better!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to give Joe's a try for a very long time. It seems my trips to Las Vegas are few and far between lately and usually center around a convention of some sort. Well I finally made it and not a minute too soon. There is a reason Joe's is always packed, clearly the service and food more than live up to the hype. Even at lunch the place has a sense of urgency in making sure you are in good hands.  Sitting at the bar our sever was of course the bartender and he could not have been more attentive and filled our ice teas and waters( it was lunch after all) with out them reaching half empty. He was busy too, no bar back and handling the growing lunch crowd like a pro.  We opted for one of their lunch specials, the perfect sized lunch highlighted by some of their signature eats.  To take the edge off this did the trick, a nice assortment of artisan breads and crisps.  Bread Basket <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2?select=3zujfFou40TxvCTHe4r4mQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a> The cracked in the claw stone crab is sea spider nirvana. Sweet and succulent in conjunction with their mustard dipping sauce and the fresh horseradish I requested was superb. Served in a stainless bowl with a spare for the discarded shell remnants. A fresh towel to clean your hands when finished, a nice touch.   Stone Crab=Stone Cold perfection  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2?select=8N88j94LQP4k3MoQzLbEVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a> Hash Browns, crispy and savory-seriously ? HB's with lunch well I will just say these had to be the best HB's I have ever eaten! Simple but prepared to perfection, crispy crunch on the outside and pillow soft on the inside. These spuds were clearly treated to some culinary love a surprise highlight.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2?select=fCtPBQzfwvP8kcDsAdO2CA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a> Not pictured the meal also came with table side prepared coleslaw and slices of beefsteak tomato. Again a real treat, super fresh and the right amount of acidic undertones and just enough mayo to make it work.  And finally a slice of the Florida Keys on a plate. Their signature dessert, Key Lime Pie.  Tart, refreshing, light with an amazing crust and a generous dollop of freshly whipped creme.  Key Lime Pie with fresh whipped creme <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-las-vegas-2?select=GzTjqnbRrtAJCJun0URYtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/joes...</a> I will surely be going back to Joe's without a doubt on my next visit to L.V. What a fantastic experience all the way around. Top notch from top to bottom!",

It seems a very high class dinning room but the experience that from the main entrance to the dinning room reception area is horrible.  (outside the dinning room is more like a pub restaurant).  No one escort us, and just point inside and ask us to walk in to the end....  We ordered the seafood platter, which consist of one piece of Jumbo shrimp,  King Crab leg (only the small piece of middle part) , Lobster tail and scallop. It costs $23.90 US per person.  It is all frozen seafood, tasteless, and I can still feel the ice melting in my mouth.    Crab cake is good with big chuck of crab meat and it is a bit dry inside.  We paid the bill after the appetizer.....and leave.",

My sister uses a wheelchair and I really appreciate that the hostess asked a couple of customers to please move their seats in for the wheel chair to pass. At almost every restaurant that we have been to, myself or someone in our party would have to ask this question. The employees are truly there to give you an memorable dining experience through thoughtfulness as well as the delicious food. I had the swordfish and it was flavorful and fresh. I also tried the ribeye and fillet, both were cooked perfectly with a nice char. I was disappointed by the stone crab. They only had the medium claws. Even though they were already cracked, they were still very difficult to eat, with tiny pieces of shell all over. The meat stuck to the shell. The crab tasted very fresh and clean, but I don't think that it was worth the price and effort. The octopus was excellent tasting, but definitely not suited for sharing. The portion of octopus was small. Overall, I will absolutely be returning to Joe's on my next trip to Vegas! I would urge anyone who likes a nice cut of meat to go for the steak entree rather than the fish. The fish is delicious, but the steak was perfection!",

    "text": "The three of us took a meandering road through Joe's menu, starting with steak tartare, moving onto Dover Sole with a caramelized butter sauce for one of us, and a 24oz dry-aged ribeye for each of the other two.  To share, we got the creamed spinach and the lyonnaise potatoes.  Oh, and six of the stone crab claws, which came pre-cracked and with Joe's mustard sauce which was just a little bit mustardy, and really, really tasty.  Dessert consisted of coconut cream pie and their peanut butter pie.  The peanut butter pie, filled with huge amounts of mousse, tasted like someone had made peanut butter into mousse which ... is as designed.  If you love peanut butter, you'll love the pie.  The steaks were deeply red in the middle -- on the rare side of medium rare, which is how I love them.  They were meaty, and rich, and had clearly been sitting around getting older by the day before they got served -- exactly what I'd want from dry-aged meat.  The food was fantastic.    But the service ... oh, the service ...  Start with the fact that about 3 hours before dinner we asked to change our reservation from two to three and they cheerfully acceded to our request.  Come to the fact that we were half an hour early and they sat us down when we got there.    And our waiter, Neil? an on-the-nose balance of friendliness, jocularity, but also leaving us alone when we wanted to talk.  The service was IMPECCABLE.  Neil walked us through the menu, suggested a few things, and more importantly suggested to avoid one or two things.  Nothing I hate more than a waiter who claims everything on the menu is great, and telling me that one or two things aren't great builds a ton of trust.    They paid close attention to us, but from a respectful distance.  I was drinking iced tea and they noticed what sweetener I used and proactively brought me more.  At some point, when I finished a glass of iced tea, I timed it -- it took them 23 seconds to ask if I wanted another one.  I'd come here again.  Happily.",

We then were served a delicious  basket of bread with lots of different breads to choose from. My favorite was the corn muffin.   For dinner, I ordered Joes chopped salad and fried shrimp. My husband ordered the BLT wedge salad and the grilled seafood platter. Both meals were great! My only complaint was the portion size of my salad and entree. It was a lot of food and I hate to waste. I could only eat about half of the salad and meal... on a side note, one of the reasons for going to Joes was to have a little slice of heaven with the Havana Dream Pie!! So being to stuffed from dinner was not an option! The Havana pie did not disappoint! Our waiter talked up the key lime pie so we ordered a slice of both!!! Needless to say we did not finish both desserts but hands down the Havana pie was the clear winner and a MUST HAVE!!",

    "text": "This was quite a unexpected surprise - There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas and I've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. One of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked Joe's for dinner one night. I really never had the chance to read the reviews so I really walked in blind. We arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible.   Our server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. I started with my usual Ketel One Martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. Although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. The way I see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. I validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.  I ordered raw oysters on the half shell for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of Tabasco and a hint of horseradish. There was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  We had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - I chose the Pork Belly Wedge Salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag blue cheese crumbles. Again I can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. The pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical BLT wedge salad so common at so many restaurants.   Once we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. The steak and seafood selections are amazing and I'm sure anything I'd pick would be wonderful but the Prime Cut Bone-in Filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. It's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food.   The entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. I decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately I've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any Steakhouse.   These Bone-in, Prime Grade, Filet Mignons are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.\rTrimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. Unlike a Filet Mignon on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples I've ever cut into. After experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, Joe's far exceeded any expectations I had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!",

This was the only dish I'd skip next time. Lobster and shrimps were overcooked and tough.   Large Stone Crab: $69.95 for 5 pieces. A little pricey but they were big and fresh. I'd like them saltier though, but at least it came with a mustard sauce to dip them in.   King Crab Roll: good. Big chunks of king crabs instead of shredded ones.   Fish n Chips: the best fish n chips ever! Crust was light and crispy. Fish was flaky and tasty.",

I always order bone in rib eye. Then the stone crabs. Wine or bubbly (or both).",

The waiter brought a small mound of what looked like carrots in a bowl. He then pours the warm crab bisque over it . . Yummy!! I soaked up some of the soup with the bread!!!  We also had their dry aged ribeye sandwich which was like a prime rib sandwich . . It was delicious!!!  I would definitely go back!!!",

Mini and Carlos took such incredible care of us that we couldn't have asked for better service. I was able to consume some absolutely two thumbs up gluten free food. This is a highly recommended and must eat in Vegas. The dining room is decorated and filled with an atmosphere of welcome and class. We enjoyed the market fresh King crab and the grilled seafood platter, complete with stunning mashed potatoes and broccolini. Then we're treated by the staff to a completely decadent gluten free brownie and ice cream scoop and a double shot of espresso to finish it off for the night. Thank you Joes for being exactly what we wanted and more for an anniversary dinner celebration!",

    "text": "Medium Stone Crab (7 per order) - This was pretty delicious. To be frank, the sauce they give you to dip the crab in is superrrr good. i was actually more depressed when they took away the sauce than when i had finished the stone crab. (Also, if you can't get enough of stone crabs, i'm pretty sure Baccanal buffet at Caesar's sells them during weekend brunch when they have seafood.)  Steak Tartare - very yummy!  Seafood pasta - I was a bit underwhelmed and frankly semi-disappointed with the dish. the pesto was really overpowering, so i had to eat the noodles a third of the way in and just ended up eating the seafood.  Grilled seafood platter - This is good and probably the only thing i should've gotten as my entree. Recommend!   Pan sauteed branzino - exactly what you would expect from this dish... if you're eating here, i'd recommend spending your money on something else more worth it (and exciting...). Mashed potatoes: i don't even knwo what we got but our server recommended it. it's not listed on the menu though. but it was basically a loaded plate of hashed potatoes with everything you'd want on a baked potato on top of it. THE BEST.",

Also another thing that really topped it for me, (and it might be ridiculous but) they had corn bread in their bread basket... like what?! Lol I loved it. Atmosphere was moderately loud but there was also jazz music playing in the background and Also cmon... it's Vegas haha. Def would come here again next time I'm in sin city !",

Actually that was the best part of the experience there.  We both decided to have fish entrees which sounded delicious. Started out with fresh  Oysters. I had better. Let's just say.  Soup was prepared perfectly. Crab bisque one of my favorites.  I ordered salmon my husband ordered Seabees  With sides asparagus and grilled broccolini.   The expediter sent both Entrees out RAW!!  So I asked if they could fix it. They stick it under the broiler,  the same piece and it's still raw!!   I spoke with the manager they made a whole new Salmon. but, by that time my husband was finished. So I didn't really get to enjoy it.  I have to add, our server, Eric  was very personable kind and very attentive.  you did a wonderful job.  Boston cream pie was awesome.  When we got our bill, we noticed they took the salmon off.  I know that was the right thing to do but, it just made me feel bad.  We have dine at Joes a few times and have always enjoyed the stone crab and martini's.  I'm sure we will be back. Love all the restaurants in the Forum Shops at Caesars.    .",

They truly honor their reservations.  Of all the times we've been here previously, this time I strayed from my formula.   I always get the filet.  I am a HUGE fan of lamb, but I am SOO picky, that I rarely get it, because I can't find the place that does it right..  UNTIL NOW!!!  The most perfect balance of char, the most delicious lamb meat, and the perfect amount of fat (ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS OF LAMB).   I don't think I'll be able to order anything else next time I come back!   We started with the \"Naked Cowboy\" oysters, cause we had to try, just cause of the name - and they were good, but the Kumamoto were better to our oyster palate..  (we did 1/2 dozen of each).   Land locked Vegas with the best oysters (and crab, but didn't get that this time)  Service is always exceptional.  Their wine list is and continues to be amazing.   And being a wine snob (don't let the $9 wine bottle as my profile pix fool you), their wine is always served perfectly, from storage (you can tell by the cork) temperature, and stemware.   (yes, serving wine in the right glass does make a difference, like I said, wine snob!)",

I have been coming to this location since they opened and it is consistently excellent. Everything they serve is top notch A1!!  Stone Crabs are  amazing creatures ( they're sustainable as the crab's claws grow back after harvest). If you have not had these large, meaty treats go and treat yourself. Their dipping sauce for the claws is a beautiful accompaniment. I would suggest going for the large claws as they are better ...imho  They also serve up a wonderful Alaskan King Crab roll with homemade potato chips..It's good.  Steaks are great. Seafood is great. Sides are great.  Strong wine list. Fantastic Cocktails....You can see I like this place.  If you are dining solo cozy up to the bar and dine: great as a spectator sport of watching all the goings on!  It is pricey but god it is soooo worth the money.  Highly recommended   P.S. If you are in Miami check out the original location it is an amazing restaurant with a load of history.",

I really like the sauvignon blanc from California. So I have to say their wine selection is quite great.  About the food, I think it was a bit over-priced, which apply to majority of Vegas restaurants on the strip. I had a sea bass because they did not have the scallop. It was not a small piece, but the presentation was quite disappointing. It tasted good, but not amazing, a tiny bit over cooked in my opinion. But very mildly. My friend had fried chicken and seafood platter, they might taste good, but again there was no presentation at all!!  So I really feel their food was just alright.   Inside was not quite big, and there is wait if you don't have a reservation in the evening, even on weekdays. So it is definitely one of the popular ones in Caesars Palace.",

Some people prefer extra tender steak, while there are others who enjoy a tiny bit more chew in their steak such as this ribeye. Flavor-wise, their steak was on par with the best. The smell of it alone was enough to get you excited and the execution does not fail the expectation of the human senses. Every bite you take brings you back asking for more. They provided a small serving of seasoning of the side which allowed for self -proportioning to suite each person's tastebuds. Don't forget to make a reservation before showing up. The guy at the check-in counter was kind enough to let us sit without a reservation.",

Everything was on point they served the Dover sole table side and my steak was how I liked it rare plus.

My food was great, girlfriends fish was kind of bland.. Also got free cake for girlfriends birthday and brought out a free dessert for me for being local and making good conversation. Parking does suck, since you have to pay! Not the restaurants fault. That's a Caesars Palace thing!",

I haven't ordered too much from here because I am stuck completely on the shrimp de jonghe, shrimp cocktail, and the Alaskan king crab legs. This time I also ordered the special corn side. That was not disappointing. Keep doing your thing Joes!!",

    "text": "This just wasn't anything special imo. I would only suggest Joe's if good seafood is hard to come by where you live.  Our waitress in the bar area was okay. She provided a lot of information we didn't ask for, but wasn't easy to get a hold of when we wanted her.  The bus boys were very kind and polite, for what that's worth.  We tried to order calamari. We were told we couldn't get it because they got the wrong size delivered. That was annoying but it is what it is. Then we told the waitress we didn't want an appetizer if that was the case and she kept trying to sell us on the other various apps. It's understandable to suggest an alternative but I don't need four other appetizer suggestions crammed down my throat. We had already read over the menu and said no thanks so that was annoying as well.  We were served a variety bread basket while we were waiting which I was actually excited for. I LOVE bread. But there was not a single bread or cracker in the basket I liked! That's just my personal taste but it was disappointing.  I tried the mac and cheese side. It was fine. But not great and not something I'd have to get again.  Both myself and my mom got the fish and chips. It was good.. it was fair priced for Vegas. It wasn't greasy. There's nothing wrong with it. But again, it wasn't anything special. I'll admit we are a bit spoiled since we come from Washington state where fresh seafood is readily available, but it just seemed like something we could easily get at home. It wasn't any better. It wasn't amazing. It wasn't something I'm excited to eat again. I come to Vegas for 'special' / 'fancy' / 'extravagant' / 'over the top', not the same old, same old. And same old, same old is what we got from Joe's.",

When we arrived at the restaurant, all six of us were seated and given two bread platters and two creamy butter plates. Our waitress was super kind and hilarious, we absolutely loved her and this review has nothing to do with the amazing wait staff at the restaurant. The review is for the food at the restaurant. My friends ordered the seafood pasta, the salmon, the specialty snapper, hash browns and Mac and cheese. Since the entrees come a la cart, we had to order sides that we thought we would like.   I didn't like that because I would have loved to see what the chefs decided would compliment our meal, because we were absolutely dying after we ate. An hour after we ate everyone felt really heavy and two people threw up their meal. They were the ones that shared the hash browns and the Mac and cheese and their main complaint was that they were both swimming in oil. I have to say the same goes for every meal we had except for the snapper. The snapper was dry while the salmon was drenched in butter. The seafood pasta is drenched in olive oil and the French fries for the fish and chips were so greasy we had to eat it with a fork. I had the Dry Aged Chopped Steak and I had no complaints other than the fact that without a nice side, my meal felt absolutely ridiculously heavy, so I couldn't make it out yesterday.   All in all, the food is really greasy for the price, I hate how it's a la carte and they just don't charge extra to just put an amazing side with the meal and everyone got sick and wasn't able to continue our birthday festivities.",

I remembered coming here the last time i was in Vegas and i went to town with those stone crab claws so i was really craving them again!!  *Ambience:  They have a formal seating area and a bar area. I went to their restaurant.   *Service: Pretty good! You can tell the waiters have been working there since they were in their 20s.. now they are probably in their 50s :)  Try to make a reservation, it gets really busy!  *Food: I tried their crab bisque, crab cake, octopus (super tender) and their stone crab claws!  I really liked them all! Specially those claws! I dont think we have them in Hawaii so i licked those leaving no meat behind!   Overall, i do wish heaven has a seafood buffet!  #bellyapproved",

They're so pricey but soooooo worth it!!   The bread basket contained many types of bread. My favorite was the corn bread that tasted like muffin!! We also had the bone in filet mignon and 3 sides to share. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare. We shared sweet potatoes, mushroom and creamed spinach. They were all very good. The mushrooms were excellent and they weren't on the menu but they made them for us away. The service was very professional and comfortable like what a steakhouse should be. We had two glasses of wine and a glass of espresso martini. Everything was just so delicious. I would definitely come back here if I go to Vegas again!!!",

We both ordered the Filet and Tail. Both steak and lobster were done well with great flavor of the respective dishes. Highly recommended. I got the Lyonnaise potatoes with caramelized onions on top. It may have been cooked with mayonnaise which made it too rich for my liking. Wife got the baked potato, which was very good and should have been my choice too.   I like when the wait help enjoys my company. I'm Asian. My waiter was either grumpy or discriminatory. He went about his job but was not very friendly. The table next to us has a young waitress than engaged with her customers and they were laughing a lot. The waiters attitude can enhance the dining experience. 5 stars for the food and 3 stars for my waiter.   We have had 90% of our wait help during this trip being very friendly and fun. They have spoiled me with their great customer service.",

We had a great experience. We sat at the bar. The bartender was great. She shared the specials and told us about the stone crab that Joe's is knows for. Stupidly, we did not get the stone crab, but we still enjoyed our meal. It's on our list next time.   The bread basket itself is worth reviewing. It has pretzel bread, cornbread, raisin bread, a dinner roll, and a crispy sheet of something. I don't know what, but it was delicious. All of it was!!  We shared the Madagascar shrimp, the colossal crab cake, the wedge, and the mixed grill. To me, the Madagascar shrimp was too far grilled, some of it tasted burnt, but overall we enjoyed our entire meal. The crab cake and lobster was my favorite!! We will be back for the Stone crab next time.",

    "text": "Walking into this place, you would assume they are legit fine dining. But the best way I can describe Joe's Seafood is like one of those casual, yet fancy restaurants you'd find in the middle of a mall or airport. The thing I found slightly off-putting were the waiters (more on ours in a bit). I mean, the suits they make these poor fellows wear make them look like undertakers at a funeral or something. The whole thing is quite grim and looks like they're in desperate need of a redesign. Grim intros aside, let's get to the part most people care about: the food.  Crab bisque: If you decide to come here, you have GOT to try the crab bisque! It's as the teens would say, \"totes amazeballs\" (my condolences for the lame dad joke). But seriously, folks, the broth is creamy, perfectly seasoned and really gives you a warm feeling in the back of your throat; like eating chicken soup for the first time as a kid on a cold winter's day, only better. 10 out of 10 for this one.  Lump crab cake appetizer: This one was...pretty damn good. I will say this...it probably would have been just okay, had it not came with remoulade sauce. That sauce adds just the right amount of spicy kick I've come to expect and appreciate in a solid crab cake recipe. Without it, it tastes alright, but nothing too exciting. And a top notch crab cake shouldn't need remoulade sauce, but it's nice to have as an option. 8 out of 10.  Jumbo lobster tail: Holy Jebus!! This thing is bigger than my first born child!! Seriously, if you get this, keep in mind this sucker is 22 ounces! And you can imagine how much it costs. Needless to say, the misses and I split it between us and it did not disappoint in the portion area. However, mine was slightly under cooked and could have used more seasoning. But since it was technically still edible, I didn't bother sending it back, as that would have been more trouble than its worth with the waiter we had (we'll get to him in a minute). So, I did my usual: put some salt in the clarified butter, a little on the lobster and it tasted fine. But I was hoping for a bit more here. 7 out of 10 for this ginormous sucker.  The baked potatoes were fine. Nothing to write home about though. But what I really wanna talk about now is..  The service: The waiter was attentive, yet stoic...almost as if he didn't want to be there serving us. What's especially upsetting was how he'd like, make an annoyed face every time my wife asked for more of something. I made sure to be extra polite and everything because I figured, maybe the guy was having a bad day. I mean, this is Vegas for crying out loud! You'd think most employees get paid quite well here (no body that vacations here should be broke). So, any waiter in his right mind would be on their very best behavior so they could score a good tip. Unfortunately, we couldn't pull it with this guy because he just...seemed off.  By the way, I feel it's important to mention that you do NOT get free refills for your soft drinks. I guess those bottles of Coke must have been part of a vintage collection or something; because the several refills my wife got ran up the bill faster than my two glasses of Cab did. Yowza!  At the end of the night, Joe's is quite the delight, but not quite perfect. Most of the food was great, though it's a bit weird the main course could be out shined by the appetizers. Makes me wonder if I shouldn't have just gotten the crab cake dinner instead. At any rate, I would give Joe's Seafood Pr- (yeah, I ain't typing the rest of that sentence of a title) 4 servers who look like undertakers in need of a complete makeover out of 5.",

We dined in Joe's and I loved it then. Fast forward 2 years later and I ended up moving here and have for the past 5 years. I've been here quite a few times and have always had wonderful experiences.   This past Sunday night we had reservations for 830pm. Their valet is RIGHT outside the restaurant so we took advantage of that. Well, unfortunately we got stuck in the Breitling store (husband bought a new watch) and I called to let them know we were running late. They assured me that they held tables for 20 minutes.   30 minutes later we were finally done and sheepishly showed up to Joe's. We apologized and asked if we could wait for a table. Well the gentleman at the front desk got us sat immediately and into a booth in the back of the restaurant as we had requested via Open Table. I thought this was great because most restaurants don't actually follow the notes I leave on Open Table and I have to remind them.   Our server was Pete S. We established that we were quite familiar with Joe's and he read the table well, he didn't hover but was still available to take care of us with water refills, bread, etc. We ordered our cocktails, a lemon drop martini for me and a gin and tonic for my husband. The bread basket was nice and varied with 5 choices but not warm, I especially enjoyed the cornbread and pretzel roll. I do wish the butter was soft and spreadable but it was pretty cold and difficult to spread.  The crab cake appetizer was great, pretty filler free and it fell apart as soon as we cut into it to share. We didn't even use the mustard sauce that accompanied it, it didn't need it. They ended up running out of large stone crabs which is what I was craving but they still had select stone crabs so that's what I chose. My husband got the Dover sole which is deboned tableside. Our sides were the hashbrowns and Mac and cheese.   We both loved our main entrees. My husband let me try his Dover sole and I want to order it for myself next time. I enjoyed our sides, too and was worried since I had heard bad things about both the hashbrowns and mac and cheese but I had no complaints.   I got a half slice of key lime pie to take home and when I opened it, it was HUGE. No complaints here on the pie, it was scrumptious   At the end of the meal, we accidentally knocked over an ice water and Pete came over immediately to help clean it up. He was a great server and I appreciate how he wasn't extremely chatty since we weren't looking for that that evening. As I said earlier, I think he read our table well.   We'll be back of course and I already can't wait. I do wish they would bring back half portions of the sides so you could try more.",

    "text": "Joes is a must try while in Las Vegas. I know people reviewing lately say that it's past it's prime, that's just not it's consistently good.   When I dine here, I generally get some stone crab and a steak. Yes, the steaks are amazing even though Joes is more of a seafood restaurant. Don't miss the New York strip!  When selecting your stone crab claws, spend a little more and go with the bigger ones. They are much easier to eat!  They are served cracked, but they do take a little work to get the bits of shell off.   Ask for Suzanne! She is a fantastic server and a riot!   Reservations are a must any day of the week. It's packed. Joes is definitely not passed its prime.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Stone crab.  It's the reason you're here.  So...  The only place in Vegas that you're guaranteed the seasonal Florida treat (stone crab season runs October 15 - May 15 of each year).  Incredibly sweet, with the larger claws, about the size of your palm, the best with a firm but flakey texture similar to Dungeness crab body meat as opposed to a king crab leg but several times sweeter.  It always pairs beautifully with a creamy, honey mustard sauce to kick up the richness.  Tip:  bigger is better. Tip:  don't order if out of season.  Sweetness is lost with freezing.  Dining out of season?    Two standout seafood salads.  The king crab Louis, an excellent interpretation of the classic.  Romaine, crisp asparagus, onions, tomatoes, hearts of palm, avocado, chopped eggs and a pile of sweet king crab body meat with the perfect, creamy Louis dressing.  Not decadent enough?  The seafood chopped salad is a mountain of king crab, lobster, and shrimp atop romaine with a good pour of creamy vinaigrette to bind it all together.  All seafood is properly cleaned and cooked.  No rubber shrimp here.  The  super colossal Madagascar shrimp, always a winner.  16\" long, grilled head on shell removed around the tail to properly \"puff\" and char the sweet flesh.  A side of key lime aioli accompanies it but seriously, just pull off the head and squeeze the creamy, briny, rich head fat over the tail and devour.  (sold by the piece).  Well made, tender charred octopus and correct, juicy, not too salty, jumbo king crab legs (half shelled for instant gratification), beautifully seared, uber sweet scallops and excellent colossal lump crab cake with nearly zero filler all make for an excellent seafood feast.  The only boring items, steaks.  On par with other mid tier steakhouses (USDA prime, wet and dry aged cuts, well trimmed, great sear, even cooking to temp).  No complaints but you're missing the point of the experience.  Very good wine list with a bizarre organization (some by varietal others by region of the world).  Typical, high Vegas resort markup.  Proper bur friendly efficient service.  \"Stone crab, it's what's for dinner\"  hmmm, that needs work but none the less, tasty advice.",

The crab cakes are wonderful! There wasn't any filling or bad extra breading, just delicious crab! The steak was cooked perfectly medium and was juicy. The service complemented the food perfectly.

Highly recommend doing reservation but can still walk in and sit by the bar area.   Service is great. Haven't had a bad service for the past ten years that we have been going.   They have great selection from salad, fish, seafood, steak, sides, and dessert. They have an extensive selection of wine.   Yes they are known for their stone crab- really best during peak season as they are flown fresh.   I recommend the Dover sole and sea bass. Miso sea bass melts in your mouth. Dover sole is debone by table side, served with that lemon butter.   Can't go wrong with their steak- I think it's the best price in the strip for the quality you are getting. Must get the bone in ribeye- seasoned properly and cooked perfectly.   For sides, they are big usually good for 2-4 people. If it is in season- must get the grilled corn- been there so much that I know how to cook it already.    Save room for dessert!!! PIES ARE AMAZING- can't go wrong on what you choose.",

I don't think I've ever met a server who had this much information about the menu! He gets 5/5 stars for sure. Every question we had was answered. We are so glad we came here!! I ordered the 1lb king crab legs, which could've easily fed 3 people. My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak and said it was fantastic. We barely touched the Mac n cheese because our entrees were so filling. The little we did have was a bit too gummy for my liking.  This place was wonderful but very overpriced even for Las Vegas. We ended up around $200 for our meal with no alcohol. I was sad they didn't offer the crab in a smaller serving size because I wasted about 1/2 of it  due to the fact that my boyfriend has allergies and I can't take it \"to go\". So I may go visit some other steakhouses in Vegas  before I come back to this one again. Service was excellent though!",

We passed this restaurant in the mall and figured we would give it a try. What a wonderful surprise. I thought we might be under dressed to eat here, but they let us in.  Typically when you go to a restaurant you get steak sauce, this place gave you mixed salts. OMG, it was wonderful. It was a great meal. Will definitely return if we ever go back to Vegas.",

    "text": "Joe's is living off their reputation which may have been well deserved however it is a restaurant that serves mediocre food at very high prices.  My dining companion and I had stone crab and Alaskan king crab for an appetizer. The Alaskan king crab was delicious and easy to eat as the shell was split in the kitchen and the meat comes out in one piece. The stone crab was a different story as the shell was smashed in the kitchen and there were numerous small pieces of shell that were hard to see when you separate the shell from the meat. If you happened to miss a small piece of the shell you are in for a surprise if you bite on a piece of the shell as it is hard as.... well, a stone.  For main courses my companion had a filet mignon (ordered medium) and I had the grilled seafood platter, which consisted of Madagascar shrimp, lobster and scallops. We had sides of sauteed spinach and crispy brussel sprouts. The steak was raw in the middle and overdone on the exterior which is inexcusable when you are paying Joe's prices and there is the sous vide technique to ensure steak is cooked perfectly. My items were mixed with the shrimp tasting fine, the lobster was overcooked and the scallops varied from one to the other as to their doneness and taste. All of my items were grilled and there were black carbonized pieces that I had to separate from my food. There was an unpleasant sauce, which I think was a mixture of butter with a herb sauce, that completely detracted from the flavor of the seafood. The spinach was insipid and the brussels sprouts were overcooked.  We were celebrating a special occasion and received a complimentary dessert of ice cream with a brownie. The brownie was overcooked and only tolerable with the help of the ice cream.  The service was a strange blend of familiarity, camaraderie (the waiter commenting, jealously, that he would dine with us if he had the opportunity) and condescension with a touch of arrogance. Then there was meaningless attention such as replacing the generous stainless steel bowl for the crab shell when it was less than one third full.  There are so many choices of dining in Vegas and Joe's shouldn't be one of them. Chose a restaurant where the chef is prominently featured so you know that someone is putting their reputation on the line. Joe's is a stale restaurant with a menu lacking any imagination and relies on a clientele that is clinging to a time gone by and don't know they could have a far superior experience at over 50 other restaurants on the strip, and spend less at the majority of them also.  I have dined at many high end restaurants around the world and it continue to amazes me that places such as Joe's can survive when there are so many excellent dining establishments where ever you may travel.",

The venue itself is very nice with bottles of wine and champagne lined walls. They bring out a bread basket which was delicious including pretzel bread, corn muffins and other breads. Wait staff super attentive and very high class. Our waiter, Patrick, was awesome! Nicest guy - spent time with us explaining the history of Joe's and how they catch the awesome stone crabs they serve. If you go, you MUST have the stone crabs. Its what they are famous for and with good reason. Served with a dipping sauce - out of this world. If I get the chance to go back, I'd bypass a main entree on double up on the stone crab as it was that delicious! If you are in Miami, DC or Vegas, definitely go to Joe's. Worth it! We did have steaks as our entrees and they were very good as well.",

The full was cooked to perfection. There were 3 in my party so we shared an order of roasted corn and spinach and a bottle of wine. Everyone really enjoyed their meal.

Our dinner started early, at 5:30pm, since the 7:00pm window was full, and the only choices were 5:00pm or 9:00pm. But we ended up dining here until 10:30pm, and the service was great.  No one tried to rush us out and our waiter was very attentive.  We started off with an appetizer of fresh king crab legs and stone crabs, cole slaw, champagne and pinot grigio. The waiter described the king crab legs as never being frozen since it just came from Alaska the morning of our dinner.  But I am not sure of that... everything was very delicious, especially the stone crab legs with the mustard dipping sauce and the cole slaw. we then continued with family style, dover sole, aged prime rib and side dishes of the cream spinach, broccolini, green beans and asparagus.  the dover sole was very delicious! it was juicy and not bland, and had the right amount of moisture.  Aged prime rib was the right amount of juiciness.  Crisp on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside. we finished off a couple bottles of cab and pinot noir. Had 5 different types of dessert, which I don't remember because I was stuffed by that point!   great location and ambiance.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed.  I have been wanting to dine here for a while -  it has been years since I first tried stone crab in Florida.  I finally had the opportunity and was going to splurge a bit, but what a waste of money. I ordered the medium plate of stone crab claws (their smallest choice @ $34.95) and also got the cup of crab bisque to start.   The soup tasted nice, but the texture was off.  It looked like the fat was starting to separate out of the cream soup.  I know bisque is fattening, but I really don't want to see the oil slick at the top of the bowl. My main disappointment was in the stone crab claws.  The texture of the crab meat was wet.  Now, I probably should have guessed that they would have been previously frozen, but somehow I expected them  to have a way of doing this that wouldn't hurt the texture of the crab so noticeably.   The shell on stone crabs is quite thick, so they pre-crack the claws for you.  I don't remember ever having this problem before, but  with about every other bite, I was getting small bits of shell in my mouth  that I was then trying to discreetly spit out.  It just wasn't worth the $50 for my lunch.  About half way through the meal I grew tired of the crab and didn't even finish it.  That hurts me just to type it.",

I did not receive my cocktail until I was half way through my soup.  I had brought a bottle of wine which was on the table but it was not until after I received my meal and asked to have it opened was I told they do not open wine.  Then it took a good 15 minutes to get the bottle I had ordered delivered and opened.",

And my husband LOVED his filet mignon; said it was in the top ten steaks he's ever had, and he's had a lot of nice steaks! The sides were generous; we shared one steamed asparagus and were satisfied. That plus one glass of wine and tip netted $100. Not too shabby for a nice and delicious Vegas dinner. Great service and amazing food; we will return on our next Vegas trip and order the exact same thing!",

    "text": "my husband brought me here for a surprise birthday dinner, dragged me around caesar's without telling me where we were going until we finally found the restaurant tucked in the corner of the mall.   you can choose from a series of sizes of crab, we went with the premium or middle-large size of crab.   i've never had stone crab before but it is just the most sweet buttery delicious crab in the world, without any sense of brininess to weigh it down. it is simply heavenly.   the steamed arms are brought out cold and cracked with big full pieces of crab meat in each joint of the arm served with a bit of mustard dipping sauce... no need for any sauce just take the crab flavor straight as is, it is just beautiful.  and just so you know stone crab are protected and only one limb is harvested at a time so that they can keep one arm to survive... and this does not kill the crab and their arm grows back with time. for you eco geeks out there that means that it is a sustainable food and good for the survival of the stone crab.  i cannot wait to go to florida to try it again near the source, one can only imagine how much better it can be!  as far as joe's of las vegas, there are two areas, more formal dining in the back and casual patio front both areas with the same menu.  we had reservations and were seated in the back room...it was very traditional and formal, all beautiful wood paneling and ultra lush carpeting and cushy seats...a tad too stuffy for my liking but i tend to enjoy more casual friendlier service and my dirty dives. we ordered prime rib along with the stone crab everything was delicious, service impeccable.    joe's also delivers stone crab from florida you can go to their website to place an order. we received a gift set a few months after my first experience and it was excellent as well!",

It's served cold which was different than what I'm used to, but it was still great. It says market price but it was $79 last night and I couldn't tell you the poundage, but we also ordered scallops, shrimp cocktail and a cup of soup, all to share, and couldn't finish the crab!  The scallops were very delicate and melt in your mouth yummy. One did have some sand in it, crunch crunch, but I guess that's expected sometimes.   The lobster bisque was delish! We shared it, it's very rich but yummy. Would be awesome on a rainy day (still good with 115 degrees outside)   If there has to be a con... The shrimp cocktail was really really good.., but each shrimp is basically $4 each! But fresh, cold and meaty. Haha funny I'm ok spending $80 on crab but not $16 for shrimp.   Maybe I watch too many Gordon Ramsay shows, but I agree that the tuxedo attire for wait staff is a little funeral home. Our server was super sweet and very great at her job though. A little stuffy overall but elegant.   Service was fast and friendly, we would go back if we're wanting great seafood and paying for it ($140 before a tip for 1 soup, 1 shrimp cocktail, 1 order scallops, 1 order king crab legs) the bread basket was amazing too!! Carb heaven!",

He sat us inside the main dining area, and there was no wait for lunch on a Saturday.  Call ahead if you know you're heading there and he'll set you up.    On my last visit, the stone crab claws were a bit disappointing, but we tried them again because it was a first for my friends, and this time, they were delicious.  Sweet, tender, and a better deal if you order the select variety with an order of 6 for $45.    Of course I had to get the Alaskan King crab legs, and they did not disappoint.  Lunch prices were $55 for 1 pound as opposed to 1 1/2 pound for $80.  If you want the dinner serving, they're more than happy to give it to you.    Our party tried the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster tail tempura, oysters rockefeller, fried asparagus, sweet corn, and hash brown loaf.   All were delicious, except the hash browns.  I thought they were a bit overdone, and too salty.  They are topped with a ton of caramelized onions which at first sounded perfect, but they were way too oily.  That we wouldn't order again.    We each finished our lunch with half slices of their pies. The flavors on the table were key lime, chocolate peanut butter, havana dream, and another flavor I can't remember.  If you like key lime, theirs won't disappoint.  But we were in absolute awe of the havana dream.  Our waitress described it as a tres leches pie, and it was amazing.  I even considered taking a whole pie home.  It's that good.  Don't be fooled by the \"half\" slice.  It's actually a very generous size.",

I ordered the fishermas platter and my guy friend who I went to dinner with ordered the fish and chips; both dishes were delicious! The fishermans platter/plate offered a great variety of items which included cod fillet, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. I had them grill my scallops and fish and boy did they do it just right. The calamari and shrimp I requested to be fried, together they gave me life!!!  I cannot wait to go back here, more so, bring some people and treat them.   We also ordered two sides: Mac and cheese (yum) and skillet fried corn (even more yummy). All in all it was worth every sent, a mid pricy place but I was more than satisfied. I'm itching for more as I type. Didnt get around to the desserts but they do offer a nice selection of them. For me, the \"sweet\" highlight of the meal was when the guy I'd been dating for 5 mos formally asked me to be his girlfriend. Joe's now has a place in my heart and tummy, and without a doubt pocket book :)  Go! It's a cool spot, with a lovely ambiance to share with friends, family, or business partners. And if you're concerned about the dress code I saw people there with sneakers on so there you have it.",

Compared to other establishments of this caliber their food was a hit & miss for us that night. The filet was perfectly cooked, but the quality of the rib-eye wasn't that great. It was a little on the chewy & slightly stringy side. The rib-eye at Gallagher's in NY NY hotel was better.   The chilled stone crab claws were pleasantly sweet & delicious, but we felt that they were quite overpriced (~$25 for two claws). The 1lb lobster tail was cooked well, but lacked the subtle charred/smokey flavor that I love from a grilled lobster tail. As for the sides of mushroom, asparagus, & spinach...all three were overly salty. They also forgot our bread basket which they immediately remedied as soon as we asked about it.   Other than that our server was great (4 stars for service) & we still enjoyed a nice dinner. Our total bill including tip came to $250, but we will be trying other steakhouses/restaurants first before coming back here.",

    "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS WONDERFUL PLACE Absolutely amazing place establishment! Celebrated my husband's 40th birthday here and we were BEYOND IMPRESSED! Our gracious full service specialist was AWESOME-SUZANNE/SUSAN-LOVE HER! Her recommendations were on point.... Stuffed Mushrooms- so flavorful  Stella Bay Oysters on the half shell - so FRESH and tasty Crab Cakes- well seasoned and cooked just right Manhattan Clam Chowder-  was not brought to the table with the rest of the meal and Suzanne brought us 2 on the house.. and it was also GREAT.. I KNOW I KNOW ..you can't trust a review where everything was good BUT IT WAS!  The jumbo Alaskan crab was precracked (of course) and steamed... as big as my 5 year olds arm.. and he's no small fry!  The Lyonaisse Potato- like a cross between home fries, a twice baked potato, and a crispy outer layer topped with caramelized onions and it was enough for 6 people to share.. everything was in generous portions. The birthday brownie!!! The brownie was soft and warm, the icecream was french vanilla and the creme' fresh was NOT A JOKE!  I felt like I was cheating on my dinner when I ate breakfast... and my husband sat at the gates of food heaven for a little while!",

Otherwise, there are larger orders of steak or seafood as well as the typical upscale sides such as creamed corn and spinach.  I wasn't able to try the steak here, but one thing I can mention is that the pumpernickel bread is the absolute best you will ever taste.  I suggest buying an extra loaf and bringing it home.  Ambiance was dark, upscale, as expected.",

    "text": "i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews Joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise).   ambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted.  the wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority.   the food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the filet mignon i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from the shell before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place the shell on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the filet mignon and King Crab Legs. we were \"sold\" that they were HUGE legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great. given that i have had True alaskan king crab legs before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?  as we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, stone crabs, filet mignon with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.",

    "text": "Joe's is a stand out in the over saturated steak house city of  las vegas.  I believe every single casino has a steak house and to me they are all beat by Joe's.  At least the ones i've been too (reviews to come).  Joe's is known for their Stone Crab, which I enjoy but each steak I have had there has just been amazing.  Which says something for their attention to quality.   This consistent quality has kept me coming back and stopped me from trying other places as I can only eat steak once in a weekend.   The only reason Joe's doesn't get 5 starts is some of their sides haven't been the best.  My favorite of the side dishes is the sweet corn. The Stone crab is always on point but I keep coming back for the bone in rib-eye.  Which is served with some sort of seasoning which just brings out the flavor in every bite.  As I stated earlier, there are steak houses everywhere in vegas.  What puts Joe's on top for me is their Key Lime Pie!  It may not be for everyone but for me it has the perfect amount of sweet to tart ratio.  A thing you notice is that it is not a light green color but a yellow.  So if you ever get a key lime pie that is green just send it back!  Once you have had Joe's your standard in pie will have gone up I promise.",

We had the lunch special - salad, hash browns, 5 medium claws, and a half-slice of key lime pie.  The salad is simply a slaw of iceberg with a slice of tomato, pickle relish, and mayo.  The hashbrowns are rich and savory, and the claws are sweet and meaty, served with Joe's famous mustard sauce.  The key lime pie is hands-down the best around.  At $21.95/pp, this is a great deal and very filling.  We also ordered the crab cake - perhaps the best I've ever had and mostly crab, not much cake.  Note that the crab cake is just one cake, however.  Service is prompt and professional.  Being a Miami Beach native, it was great to have a taste of home with a great meal at this iconic restaurant.",

And I gotta tell you. The stone crabs were a little overrated. They were fine but I'm glad they weren't more expensive cuz I would have been disappointed. Not as sweet as King crab legs and I wasn't crazy about their 'special' mustard sauce.   We sat at a high boy table in the bar and had great service with a very knowledgeable server. We opted to try a lot of different dishes including the 12 oz filet that was definitely more than 12 ounces. Plus we had the corn (to die for!), mashed potatoes (ok), grilled tomato (great!), the wedge salad (best wedge salad I've ever had!) and Joe's special scallops (pretty darn good!) PLUS the banana cream pie to end it all which was not overly sweet and  had a light caramel sauce with candied pecans on top.   Attire was casual and we felt very comfortable to just hang out and take our time savoring every last morsel. Will definitely be back!",

Water was quickly offered, and a very good bread basket arrived shortly thereafter.  However, the server took a long time to bring me a menu, and seemed in a hurry.  This slow-to-return then in-a-hurry attitude would recur.  Oh yeah, I was never even offered dessert, just handed the check.  Isn't this place famous for its key lime pie?  I had never had stone crabs, so I gave them a try as an appetizer.  They were OK, but I guess I'm not a fan.  Also, I thought Joe's was known for its mustard sauce.  None was provided.  One nice touch: after I was finished, an assistant came by with a lemon, and squeezed the juice over my hands into a waiting bowl.  He then gave me a hot, wet towel.  Much appreciated.  I had glazed black cod as an entree.  It was a big piece of wonderfully moist, flaky fish.  The glaze was excellent.  A trifle sweet, it began to cloy after a few bites.  Not to worry - half a lemon was provided; the juice made the sauce perfect.  On the other hand, I could have done without the pedestrian French fried sweet potatoes.",

Oysters were delicious but there's not much the chef has to do there.  For main entrees, I ordered the Salmon Au poivre and the hubby had the swordfish.  Here's where I found the taste and texture lacking.  Salmon was not that tasty and too lemony.  The Swordfish was too tough.  We order their mashed potatoes on the side and it was ok for me but their grilled corn was amazing.    The bill was about $160 which included tax and tip and not worth it for just OK food.  I wish I could give them more stars because the staff was really nice.",

This was seriously the best soup I have ever had. For dinner I had the filet mignon and king crab combo. The crab is served cold which was a bit odd but you can enjoy the sweet taste of the crab meat this way. They also crack the crab legs for you which makes it all the better to enjoy rather than wrestling with the shell. The steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth like butter. This place is very pricey, but well worth it if you are celebrating a special occasion.",

It was so delicious! They precrack the claws for you so you peel off the shell like you're peeling a boiled egg, making this one of the most effortless crab eating experiences I have ever had. They cooked the crab perfectly and the meat was sweet and delicious. Add some butter to that and talk about a great meal! The second dish we got was the fishermans platter, I wasn't super impressed with it, especially in comparison to the crab. But my brother and sister shared the stuffed sol with lobster tail and they were raving about it. My dad ordered oysters, and usually he'll share at least one with me because he knows how much I love them, but not this time. He devoured them in seconds! I looked over and they were all gone!!!   We also ordered some sides, and all of them were great. If I had to choose just one, my absolute favorite would be the mashed potatoes. They come out with a nice crust of cheese crisps and bread crumbs. I could have eaten just that for dinner, it was so good! We also really enjoyed the broccollini, nothing too fancy but cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning.   Our waiter was also really great. He made the dining experience so much better by offering suggestions and being really attentive. Everyone at our table kept on talking about how great he was.

    "text": "Such a fun place to be! Located inside the new part of The Forum Shoppes at Caesar's place, this place is so much fun to be at and dine at. We sat in the bar/lounge area and was not disappointed at all. We had a reservation but when we arrived they were about 15 minutes behind so we decided to sit at the bar.   I will admit, the two Hosts really need to work together and better their communication skills.   What did we eat, too much! We ended up sharing a ceviche, crab bisque, crab cake, BLT wedge salad, Joe's scallops and the copper river salmon. The BLT was best. It was so good, I went back the next day for lunch with my friend and had it again. I love salads and I love it even more when the lettuce is crisp and all the ingredients are fresh. All of our food was delicious and the vibe there again was fun and young. The bartenders were great and I love a staff the can provide an environment when you can be yourself and also know you're in a fine dining establishment. Great job Joe's!  Ha, I saved dessert for last :) Joe's has some kicking pie too. Yes, pies. Please try and save room for the blueberry pie. And when you're lucky, they'll have a rhubarb pie that is so refreshing and such a fabulous way to end your meal :)  Happy eating!",

    "text": "This is my favorite fine dining on the Strip. I've been raving about this place for years to my friend and we finally found time to enjoy a nice meal here. I got the stone crabs, which has a very unique taste to it - different from Dungeness, snow and Alaskan King crabs. These babies are only harvested in the Gulf of Mexico and they take one claw at a time so that the crustacean can regenerate a new limb. The dipping sauce is what really makes this dish stand out as it has a dozen different ingredients. My friend ordered the Chilean Seabass which was glazed with miso. It melts in your mouth and is simply scrumptious. The crab chowder is excellent as is the Ribeye steak. Jenny's mashed potatoes and grilled corn are my favorite side dishes here. Steer clear of the Key Lime Martini. I love sweet drinks but even this was too much for me.",

We started off with the appetizer called the \"2nd mortgage\" and it was awesome. Lobster, king crab, peeled shrimp and a seafood ceviche.  Oh how I love thee.  Next came our stone aged filet and stone crab (medium sized) entrees accompanied by mashed potatoes topped with an Asiago cheese crust.  Heavenly!  Even the asparagus was cooked to perfection.    The service was superb and this is going to be on my must come back to when I'm in Vegas list!  The atmosphere is a little crowded and noisy but who cares about that when the food is so delicious!",

One night was a far more extravagant night- claws, cakes, pies, wine, scallops, steak, fish, sides... Big bill obviously got us greats service. (oh, an the food was excellent! I LOVE crab and those claws are worth the price. I had been skeptical, but it's True).  But the other time, we were being more light and frugal: 3 of us shared 2 meals- one was a sandwich from the bar menu. I ordered the mac and cheese b/c, c'mon, that's what I do. The server, halfway through us eating the M&C came back and said that it was a new mac on the menu and he didn't think that the kitchen had gotten ours right-enough, and he was bringing us a new one to try (!!! two mac and cheeses for me!). And on Open Table I had mentioned that we had a b'day in the group, and they took that seriously. Everyone told her happy birthday, and she got a brownie sundae for dessert. It was so nice to feel that appreciated when we clearly weren't big spenders that night.",

Service was outstanding. It is actually quite kid-friendly; however, as it is on the \"nice\" side of casual (waiters are in black suits), is probably best suited for ages 7 and up (or mature 6 year olds). They do a great job with crab. Joe's key lime pie is the best we've had anywhere, and just as good as the original.

They include two sides and dessert and there is usually a filet and a stone crab offering.  To my dismay on this visit...no stone crabs.  As a big fan of this sustainable food,  I'm well aware of the national shortage due to the squid infestation so I understood but was disappointed since it was the reason I was there.  Instead they were substituting king crab legs.  Our waiter did a good job of explaining the situation and eventually convinced me to give it a try.  It was a very good decision.  Still not the stone crabs I was craving but a very good option.  The legs were already split and full of cold, sweet crab meat.  The sides included their delicious roasted sweet corn along with equally as good lyonnaise potatoes.  For dessert the crab lunch came with Havanna Dream Pie which is more cake-like as in boston cream pie but which I really enjoyed.  Two of us had ordered the crab lunch and the waiter was nice enough to substitute key lime pie for one of us.  Overall, an excellent meal.  Others in our party had the fish and chips and the scallops.  None were disappointed and everybody loved their meal. My 90-year old Stepdad called them  \"The best scallops I've ever had.\"  Would I have preferred the stone crabs that I came for?  Of course! The meal did not disappoint though.    As for the location in the Forum Shops, it can be a little tricky to find but they do offer valet parking right outside the Joe's entrance to the mall which is great and worth the effort to find.  At lunch, the seating options are the bar or a cafe setting that is open to the mall and can be loud.  Not ideal but you won't care.  The food is that good.",

    "text": "I would have given this 3.5 stars, but i will go with the 4 stars. the 3.5 was based on my other parties experience.   First we had to try the stone crab, so we got two stone crabs and for two is was $22.95. But they were unlike any crab i have ever had, the texture was a little more solid then other crabs and they serve it with this chilled mustard sauce, which is ummmmmmmmmm so good. We even saved the sauce to try it with the petite filet mignon.   My wife ordered the Filet mignon which i had a bite and it was very good, she ordered it with a creamy horseradish sauce, but combine the mustard and the horseradish sauce together and you have a match made in heaven.  I ordered the stone crab bisque, which was very rich, but very tasty.   Since everything is al carte, we ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, which these portions are big enough for 3 to 4 people to share. The potatoes where crispy and the onions on top were cooked to perfection great side.  Other people in our group ordered the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, i didn't try it but both people who ordered it didn't like it. But the two people in our group who ordered the Filet Mignon, both loved it.",

The crab bisque is exceptional and the second mortgage on the appetizer menu is a great value. Save room for dessert - the pies are worth it. We don't like to dress up in Las Vegas, so we usually eat in the bar at the tables. Most people in there are eating full dinners, so don't be shy if you feel like you are too casually dressed. They are very welcoming in the bar, and we never have to wait or make a reservation.  Valet is free right outside the restaurant.",

We actually went specifically for the stone crab claws, which they were out of :( now I know it's best to call ahead. But they won me back with solid food and great service. The crab bisque was perfect. It was strong and flavorful without being sour or fishy. The crab cakes were the real deal, big tasty lumps of crab meat with just  barely enough bread crumbs to hold them together. Prefect. Our server was charming and commiserated with our disappointment at not finding the stone crabs available. I'll be back, but next time I'll call ahead.",

A lot of cartilage and broken shells to contend with.  By itself, the flavor was fine but the Mustard sauce really made it.  I think I'd rather have dungeness crab, more economical.  Manhattan Chowder was OK,  Bisque was a bit rich and a bit salty for my taste.  What else do you expect from something that came from the sea, you ever drank seawater?    We sat in the bar area which made the atmosphere busy.  Service was quick.  It is a good place to try, but I won't repeat.  I'm wonder if it didn't appear that great to me because of the hype and expectation I was given, with this restaurant and especially stone crab.  I would be great to try it again but there are a lot of places left to try in Vegas.  Not enough time and not enough money.",

The bone in ribeye is outstanding and the Stone Claws are infamous with their mustard sauce.  I've also would rank the Black Cod as some of the best fish I've had in a long long time.  It's curious but the bar food here is just as outstanding as the dinner menu.  The burgers and appetizers never disappoint while the service here is outstanding.  This place is always packed but it is not difficult to eat here off dinner hours say 5pm or 8pm.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this place as it's reputation precedes itself.  Top notch food, wine, and service with valet right outside the restaurant.  Do not be put off by all the tuxedo waiters as this is in Vegas so jeans and a T-Shirt will get you in but you will feel a bit under dressed with mink coats and suits surrounding you.  Worth the money you'll spend and opt for the Large or Special Stone Crab Claws even if they do run you $55 for 4 of them.  Huge amount of meat on them vs the medium size claws.  I do bring my children here and the servers are very accommodating with patio (in the mall) seating vs the dining area.  I am a regular here.",

For starters we had their assorted bread basket - I liked the crispy flat bread the best.  Then we shared the seafood chopped salad with shrimp, lobster, Alaskan king crab - the seafood and salad was served ice cold, it was fresh and delicious.  For my entree, I had the medium stone crab - 7 per order.  The crab is served cold and cracked for you already.  It was fresh and flavorful, but I wished it was served hot - I prefer my crab served hot.  I ate about five pieces of crab and gave two to my hubby.  My hubby had the rib eye 16 oz. steak with a baked potato and we shared a side of skillet fried corn.  He loved his steak - it was flavorful, tender and juicy. We both enjoyed the skillet fried corn - it was so sweet and seasoned perfectly.  For dessert, they brought us Havana dream pie - a custard tres leches cake with fresh whipped cream, dulce de leche sauce with a side of fresh sliced strawberries - OMG this pie is super yummy!  The food was very delicious, and the service was excellent.  We'll definitely dine here again!",

For lunch, I ordered the stone crab special (of course), which came with 5 stone crabs, hashed brown potatoes. coleslaw and key lime pie for dessert.    The stone crabs were served with a special mustard sauce.  I am not normally a fan of mustard, but it was yummy.  I love shellfish with just a squeeze of lemon, so I opted to eat it that way.  The stone crab was quite good.  It wasn't the best I have had, but it was still delicious.    The hashed browns were terrific, but I am always fond of potatoes.    The coleslaw was... interesting.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.  The best part about it was the sliced tomato garnish.  Enough said.  The key lime pie tasted like it was previously frozen, as it was QUITE cold.  That said, it was phenomenal.  I have had key lime pie in Key West and this rivaled the best Key West key lime pie.  There was no weird green dye in this pie, as you often see in \"fakes.\"  Joe's is located in my favorite mall, The Forum Shops at Caesars.  They are, coincidentally, a stone's throw away from Agent Provocateur (a must-stop for any lingerie collector such as myself).  Of course, I didn't pop into AP with my lunch date... but that will be revealed in another review altogether.  :)  Would I come here again?  Certainly.    TIP: Make reservations, even for lunch.  We arrived slightly tardy for our 11:30 lunch date, but a table was held for us.  Even though there were several open tables, those who approached the maitre d'  without a reservation were only given the option of bar seating (a few high tops).",

The table set up and atmosphere is lovely- lots of people watching but tucked away in a corner and not too terribly noisy- the wait staff was SO attentive- we ordered a bottle of wine and although it was sitting in ice at the side of our table- we never had to pick it up- my glass was always promptly filled by our fantastic server- the menu is out of this world - and very reasonably priced- For steak and seafood! We both had the seafood grill - let me tell you- ORDER THE SEAFOOD GRILL!!! It was TO DIE FOR! It is served in a delicious garlic olive oil that I couldn't get enough of! Especially great for bread dipping! My husband and I shared 2 sides- although the grill was so filling we really didn't even need them! We had the mac and cheese - WOW SO GOOD!!! - and the broccolini- also awesome- my only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert because the options looked amazing!

We ordered the medium stone crabs, too. It was our first time trying that but I think I prefer king crab legs. Ohh.. the lunch special included dessert for each of us, too.

The bartender there gave us the best service, always attentive to filling drinks if needed and also even giving us hot towels after first squeezing lemon juice into our hands after digging into the succulent Joe's Stone Crabs.  I had high expectations for this place after having it first from a previous trip to Miami and this place did not disappoint. The service, decor, ambience were impeccable, and matched with the Vegas setting. I ordered the lunch combination that included 5 medium sized claws, as well as cole slaw, potato hash and also the key lime pie for dessert. The hubs got a dry aged rib-eye sandwich with fries shaped like thick potato chips that were delicious. We left really full and satisfied and would definitely come back again.",

There was a big group of us and on our 1st night we decided to eat at \"Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab\".  The food was amazingly great! Despite the bill coming to a grand total of almost $1000 it was well worth every penny! One person in our group ordered 5 King Crab Legs which were $100 each, myself ordered the Lobster Tail Tempura, which was so yummy!  The service was beyond excellent and our server was great as well, im sure he enjoyed his gratuity! The next time im in Vegas I will definitely be coming back to this establishment!",

    "text": "A table for 9 please.....I made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and we were seated promptly when everyone showed up. It was my aunt's bday and since I'm a \"foodie\" I picked Joe's. After I made my first appearance here on New Years, I hoped this place would meet the same expectations. Unfortunately it didn't.....  Food: 4.25 Stars Service: 2.5 Stars Overall: 3.75 Stars  Yes, we started off with 14 \"select\" stone crabs! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of stone crabs). This was delicious like I remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that I could dip anything in it! We also tried the Rockefeller Oyster which I was not that impressed. I didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....  I ordered the Bone In Ribeye this time and I shared it with my dad. I had it cooked Medium. Well, last time I had gotten the filet mignon and let's just say I was a bit disappointed with the steak. It was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. Luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. However, I was a really REALLY disappointed about my steak. The Jennie's mashed potatoes made up for it though as well as the garlic Spinach. I didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!  My other foodmates ordered the fried chicken (heard it wasn't as awesome as KFC's chicken, but he is a teenager), sea bass (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my Aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). Overall, I think the food was enjoyable, minus my dry steak.  Now the service....I understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. Since its a \"nicer\" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. Maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars I think we deserve some good attention. It's not that we were getting HORRIBLE service, we just were neglected. I watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. After my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. In MY opinion, I think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? Maybe I'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean I don't love Joe's...I just would ask for a different server.   Overall, the Havana Dream Pie is to die for and I love their stone crabs. Next time I will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.",

    "text": "Our second Restaurant Week meal was at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steaks and Stone Crab. We had six o'clock reservations and we were seated right away. Service was attentive throughout the meal. Frank ordered off the menu, and our friend and I went with the restaurant week menu for $50.13 and we chose the same items: Bowl of Stone Crab Bisque, Chilean Sea Bass with Jennie's Mashed Potatoes and Sauteed Broccolini and Joe's Signature Key Lime Pie.   We started with bisque and calamari ($14.95). Both were excellent! The bisque was smooth as silk and the veggies had a nice bite. It'd only be better with more crab. Because everything is better with MORE crab. The calamari was tender and lightly breaded, and the cocktail sauce had a satisfying kick from the horseradish.   After we gobbled that up, the real feast began. We dug into large crab claws ($59.95), seabass with bok choy, mushroom mac n cheese ($9.95), mashed potatoes and sauteed broccolini. It was all delicious! The claws are always out of this world. I generally prefer a hard sear on fish but this miso glaze was wonderful - a pleasant blend of sweet and salty.   We were already stuffed, but we still had dessert to come. Frank looked over the menu and chose the Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge ($7.95). That thing was a monster! It was rich, decadent and positively sinful. He could not finish it. We tried to help, but the PB pie won. The key lime pie was light and refreshing. It hit the spot!  I think I can safely say that Joe's is my favorite chain. They do it right! The Restaurant Week menu provided an opportunity to try something other than crab and the fish was indeed was stellar. The RW three courses were offered at considerable savings too. You save about $25, and $5 goes to Three Square for each meal ordered.",

They come with this side of mustard sauce that's addictingly good. What I also love about those claws is that it takes minimal effort to get to the meat in the claws. They do a good job of cracking it open just enough to where all you have to do is just peel it off.  In addition to their famous stone crab claws, our other fave is the lobster bisque.  Be sure to make a reservation well in advance as this place gets busy esp during the busy weekends.",

Finally, $8 for a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate sauce. We expected much more from the waiter's description of the dessert than that!  Overall our waiter was pretty unattentive, albeit friendly and welcoming.

We told him it was our first time at Joe's and he went through the menu with us and made some great suggestions. We started with an heirloom tomato salad and some king crab legs for an appetizer. Both items were delicious. My husband and I were both impressed with the amount of crab legs received in the appetizer portion. For our entrees we ordered herb roasted chicken and a filet with lobster tail. Again, very impressed with portion sizes. We shared mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach for sides. Everything tasted amazing! After we finished our last bite of food and decided we couldn't possibly eat another bite, our waiter brought us complimentary key lime pie and banana cream pie; he said they like to treat their first time customers to their most popular desserts. Neither are desserts I would normally order, but just like all the other food, delicious!    Overall, the place was great! Our waiter was nice and knowledgable, service was attentive, and food was absolutely fabulous. We were extremely impressed with the amount of food received for the price.

    "text": "First the gripe: who doesn't have yellow mustard with which to dress a cheeseburger? Joes, that's who. Oh, they have dijon and they have Joes sauce - but the lack of good old, American, yellow mustard is a huge miss for me.  Before anybody shoots me for going to a fine establishment and ordering a cheeseburger, allow me to explain. (1) it was lunch, and (2) I was filling a bit rough around the edges from the night before. The cheeseburger jumped off the menu as the perfect cure for what ailed me. I liked that they cooked it to order. I'm not afraid to order quality ground beef cooked to medium, and that is exactly how it came out. It was a bit messy, however, and I wound up using knife and fork. The fries were crispy and served in a very generous portion. With ketchup.  Joes, please get some mustard. I do look forward to trying you again for dinner.",

    "text": "So good! Don't hold back. We were probably some of the youngest in the restaurant but they treated us no differently. This is the type of place where they switch out your white cloth napkin for a black napkin if you're wearing a black dress. Intimate booths, dark wood, and suited up waiters.. reminds me a bit of House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. It's a refreshing classic dining experience.  Started off with a beautiful assortment of bread. My favorite was the crispy cheese flatbread. I knew we were in for a treat when the amuse bouche arrived - hamachi and caviar. We ordered the popular Stone Crabs. I'm used to dirtying my hands for crab meat but these Stone Crabs come pre-cracked and didn't want to budge out of the rock hard shells. Kept us preoccupied for a little while. Fresh nonetheless. The Seared Scallops were perfectly cooked and came with some of the best bacon jam i've come across. The cauliflower mash surprised me, i thought it was actually mashed potatoes! Creamy and buttery, you would never know otherwise. I can rave about the chilean sea bass but i'm pretty sure every dish here is worth of 5 stars.  Best part, they offer half portions of pie slices. There's always room for dessert. Don't miss the coconut cream pie. The cream is almost marshmallow like in consistency and flavor.",

We ordered two king crab lunch special. You get crab, lyonnaise potato, tomato and cabbage slaw and dessert.

    "text": "President Obama,   With all the ridiculous \"National ____ Days\" dedicated to superfluous foods like cheese doodles (March 5th) and stupid specific eats like cherry popsicles (August 26th), it's about time you stepped in and made executive decisions on something that is clearly getting out of hand.  Who the hell is rejoicing over a cheese doodle that isn't still living in their parents basement playing N64?  What if I choose to have a blue flavored popsicle on 8/26?  Will Destiny's Child come out of nowhere and start singing \"No, No, No\"?   October 15th is WIDE OPEN.  It's the officially the first day of Florida stone crab season!  I am sure you have sampled these incredible claws at a fancy dinner or two during your tenure as the leader of the free world.  You cannot deny that they are some of the most delicious crustaceans on the planet!  So in love with these claws I am, here is my proposal:  - 10/15 will be a federal holiday and be known as \"National Stone Crab Day\".  Even for vegetarians.     - Instead of only celebrating the day with bullshit Facebook posts, I was thinking something more along the lines of New Year's Eve.  There would be fireworks, confetti, and instead of holding a glass of champagne, everyone will have a large crab claw from Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  They will bite in it when the clock strikes midnight.    - I've already drafted letters to several high standing Nevada officials about closing Las Vegas Boulevard that evening to throw a parade that will end at Joe's at Caesars Palace.  Judging by my persuasive and emotionally charged message, I am confident this will be granted.    - A live televised east coast party at the original one, Joe's Stone Crab, in Miami hosted by Ryan Seacrest with Pitbull as the musical guest.  - The dip for the crab is almost equally as magnificent and should be considered for its own day.  We could go with the extremely catchy phrase: Happy National \"amazing crab dip sauce from Joe's that is pretty much crack sauce and should accompany every single bite of claw meat\" Day!    I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Sincerely,  Philip T.",

She thanks us and goes to place our order. She comes back and tells us they are out of crab!!!  Basically the only reason why we came. She was super embarrassed as her manager didn't tell her they were out.  Not her fault....two stars is because of how the manger handled it. Came over and basically said \"too bad get here earlier\".

The entree, however, was the real treat. Our server talked me into the Chilean Seabass with miso glaze and it is easily the most delicious fish I have ever put in my mouth. It was a generous serving of  his beautiful white fish, glazed in the perfect combo of soy and miso sauce. It was truly a treat. For our aides, we all shared family-style mashed potatoes, 4-cheese mac & cheese and the green beans--all delectable. I am a key lime pie fan, so that is always my go-to at Joe's and it never disappoints. My wife, however, got the peanut butter pie with hot fudge and won the night. Go to Joe's, guys. You'll never be disappointed.",

His passion and attentiveness reminded our party of the old days of Vegas. This fellow presented everything with such passion and attention, he made you fall in love with the cuisine before it ever arrived.

My wife and I ordered fried oysters as an appetizer. My wife and I do not like oysters, but I thought maybe this would taste like calamari. Well, it was still very briny and tasted too much like oysters lol. If you don't like oysters, don't order this.   We also ordered the medium sized stone crab and a rib eye with asparagus. The crab was tasty, pre-cracked, and came with some mustard sauce. The crab was meaty and good, but to be honest, it's overpriced for what it is. The rib eye was delicious as expected, but I was weirded out with the asparagus. The stalks appeared to be shaved down, so it looks like some weird white root. It didn't taste bad, but it was just weird to see an asparagus that didn't look like one.   Also, soda lovers beware, if you order a soft drink, it comes in a small ass bottle like at Mastro's, if you've ever eaten there. If you want refillable drinks, get the lemonade or iced tea.   Also, our waiter(don't remember his name), seemed like he used to work for the mob or something. He just had this mean mug on his face all night. He looked like he just came back from dragging a body into a lake or something. For spending so much money at a restaurant, you expect a friendly face and service, but unfortunately that wasn't our experience with the guy.",

I couldn't finish it all as the portion was huge and very rich but still mighty tasty. Our sides included green beans which were seasoned to perfection and onion strings which were light and crispy!

    "text": "Came here for my birthday because I really wanted some seafood and have never tried stone crab.    I made a reservation for 5 at 7pm.  The bar area was packed.  The dining area had a good amount of people too.  Crowds show this place is awesome, but I prefer to dine in a relaxed atmosphere instead of being around a big crowd.  We weren't seated until everyone in our party arrived.  The 5 of us were seating in a booth...a very....small...booth.  We were very snug in this booth and I couldn't wait for our menus to be taken away to make space for the rest of the table.  The good thing about a small booth is nothing is hard or far to reach.    I requested to change our seating to a table, but our server said no.  :(  Other than the atmosphere and small tables, the food was good.  We started off with some stuffed mushrooms and I had some crab bisque.  Best crab bisque I've had!  The bowl is served with a spoonful of shredded crab and topped with the crab bisque broth.  Rich in flavor with the perfect amount of salt.  Great portion of the bisque too.  Such a great portion, that I felt full.    Main entree was the 7 medium stone crab claws served with mustard sauce.  I requested for a side of butter.  Crab was served cold.  Claws were a good size.  The portions were more than enough.    Since it was my birthday, we ended dinner with nice fudge brownie cake with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Brownie cake was very rich...a bit too rich.  Overall the place was good, but it was loud and over priced.  I'd rather pig out at Hot N Juicy or Boiling Crab next time I'm craving seafood.",

    "text": "Wow! What can I say that has not already been said about the service and food. I made a reservation for a Thursday night at 6:30. I was really hungry so I came 30 minuets early. They were very nice and able to seat me right away without any problems. When you check in to the restaurant they walk you towards the back where it is not in the mall area. The lighting is dim but I loved it, it is a very romantic place, so perfect for a date. We were seated a very nice roomy booth. We had water served to us right away. As soon as we sat down our water was being filled. The waiter asked if we had been before but no it was our first time. He explained the whole menu in great deal and the seafood how it is cracked table side. We then got our bread basket that had a great variety of breads. It included corn muffin, pretzel roll, white roll. Rye bread, and some type of sesame hard cracker. I loved it all except for the rye, I don't like rye bread. Since the hubs is not a huge seafood fan so we decided to not get any of the king crab. Oh but when I go back I'm most definitely getting the king crab. I ordered the calamari app and the filet Oscar style, Mac n cheese, ribeye, hash browns. Omg those hash browns were the best!!!! Get the hash browns. The Mac n cheese tasted like homemade and creamy. My filet Oscar style was very much worth it. The king crab on top was so good and the sauce was just as great. My hubs ribeye was huge! Like the whole plate huge. I wish we didn't order so much food because I was stuffed to the gills. Our waiter was amazing the whole time and always check in on us. I wish I could remember his name. Overall excellent service , food, and ambiance. Well worth it and extravagant fine dining experience. We will be back every time we are in Vegas. Amazing",

There was another customer behind us who the host rudely asked us to step aside while he seated them with no reservation. My husband and I decided to just sit at the bar. The 2 bartenders rudely ignored us and 10 minutes went by and we had to ask for menus and requested to be served. At this point my husband wanted to leave but I insisted we stay after traveling all day. The female bartender totally ignored us. The male bartender was ok not great. There were 2 managers just standing in the corner staring us. I never felt so uncomfortable. The food was bland and lacked flavor. The onion strings were cold and the shrimp dish wasn't good. I can't recommend this place to anyone. Mastros is much better and service is great. Avoid Joes seafood at Ceasare's Palace.",

I can honestly say after dining here last evening that this may be one of the best meals we have had in Vegas in many years.   Reservation for 8 People 7PM arrive 30 minutes early to this large multi room venue located 1st floor of the Forum Shops.  Saddle up the bar which is packed and have quite a bit of drinks over the next 30 minutes.  1st Nice surprise of the evening they are not Knee Capping you on Booze. Very reasonable priced cocktails across the board.      With that complete we are seated promptly at 7PM in the back room of this clubby type feel steak and seafood establishment.  Its quite loud and bustling but I never felt crowded or pushed.   Menu's provided as well as special menu with today's market priced stone crabs and king crab leg pricing.  Considering they are flow in daily from Miami price points are well REASONABLE for what you pay much move for locally in South Florida and to be honest not as good.   Waiter Ryan states although we are famous for Stone Crabs steaks are their thing here as well.  So Off we go.   1st off Basket of various homemade flatbreads, breads, pretzel breads etc with nice whipped butter await us as we sit.. Wine list is a bit. Pricey but vintages are accurate and a couple of Magnums later we are moving along.    Crab Bisque is as good as anything as anyone has ever had.    Chopped Joe's Salad is perfection while it's pretty tough to screw up a wedge they did not and a nice blue cheese dressing with amble bacon etc make all salads a winner.   Some of us had orders of Stone Crabs for appetizers and they truly didn't disappoint.  Cracked to perfection, cold and clean and sweet made these as good as south Florida no question.   Large 1lb of Alaskan king crab cocktail $69.00 was as fresh and succulent as anything I've ever tasted.   We could have stopped there but we rolled right into some Filet Mignons Petit $35.0 VERY REASONABLE.  Cooked to absolute perfection..   Sides Mushrooms not on menu were simply OK....  Onion strings Excellent Sweet potato fries top Shelf Garlic crusted mashed were good  Key Lime Pie for desert Sinful.   Service was well PERFECTION... brisk without being pushy, helpful and one of our diners who was not feeling well left before eating and his order was gracefully cancelled.   In Short This place does it right and you can see why it is absolutely packed.   For what you get in this very overpriced city it is great to see top shelf food, service and atmosphere with great pricing make it's way back here...     NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR... A DON'T MISS!",

This past time, we accidentally made a reservation for the next Friday instead of the current Friday, but we were given a table anyway.   The wine list has hundreds of options from all over the world and is grouped by region. Servers are well informed about the best pairings for seafood and steaks.   Market information is provided upon seating (oysters, etc) but otherwise the menu is simple, and recommendations are freely given. \"We'll start there\" is the answer no matter what/how much you order.   Our order of a half dozen oysters and one and a half pounds of king crab legs was perfect for two people to share, but of course we had to tack on a slice of blueberry pie.   This is hands down our favorite Vegas tradition!",

There's a more casual space by the bar and thats where you'll see people who like eating steak in their swimsuit cover-ups (not judging-- it's Vegas lol, but if you wanted a ~special~ meal, basketball jerseys sorta kill the vibe).   Our waitress was top notch and made great wine and cocktail recommendations. I had a negroni that was perfect. We also did a half-dozen oysters with two of each kind they had in rotation. They were wonderful. I got a filet and lobster tail that was about as big as my forearm. All perfectly cooked. The broccolini and mashed potatoes are great and the table next to us had hash browns and seemed really pleased with it (it looked really good). We finished with a slice of chocolate fudge pie and it was wonderful.   The back dining room was pretty warm and a little stuffy so I had to peel my thighs off the banquette as we were leaving but I imagine a full suit would be uncomfortable (I have no idea how the wait staff was managing). Maybe it was just because it's summer but I'd definitely wear breathable clothes.",

Wish they had cocktail sauce or butter instead of a cream sauce for dipping. I didn't ask since they tasted fine even without sauce. Everything we had was yummers!

    "text": "We had a really nice dinner at Joe's. It gave us a reason to dress nice and enjoy the evening without all the usual chaos that comes with a Vegas weekend. I requested a nice quiet table/booth and that's what we got. I have to thank Sarina V, Samantha L and other Yelpers that have reviewed Joe's because their reviews gave me really good insight on what to order and what to expect. And one of the better tips is to valet at the Forum Shops right outside Joe's doors. Thankfully I was familiar with this valet as I always use it when i'm in town. Shortest walk. Ever.  Bread basket has a great variety ranging from cheese bread to sourdough and a cheese cracker. Butter isnt even needed but provided. The service was excellent. Our waiter Patrick was very helpful and informative. He helped steer us in ordering the makings of a great dinner. Your water will be refilled if you take 2 sips, literally. They are on it like no one's business. We had the 1/2 dozen kumamotos ($16.95), choice selection of stone crab (6 pieces; $49.95), I had the 24oz bone-in rib eye and she had the chilean sea bass in a miso glaze ($42.95). Ours sides during the main course were crispy onion strings ($8.95) and asparagus ($10.95).   The stone crab was delicious. I have been wanting to try it for a long time now. Thank you to the 305 for this delicacy. So much crab meat in that stone crab claw. It's one of the wonders of the world. Squeeze some lemon and dip in their mustard/mayo sauce. Or not... It's great either way. The kumamoto oysters were just ok. I was expecting them to be better. I would pass on them the next time. My 24 oz bone-in usda prime rib eye ($59.95) was delicious. It had so much flavor and just the right amount of fat. I ordered mine medium and it was perfect. They offer their own steak seasoning and they sure are right that a little goes a long way. It packs a lot of flavor. But it really didnt need it. The rib eye stood out on its own. It was so good. My mouth waters at the thought.  The chilean sea bass was delicious. I had a few bites of it. Great flavor. I loved the miso glaze. I recommend it. It comes with bok choy. And the sides we got were also very good. The fried onion strings and asparagus were a great compliment to our main courses.  A great dinner. Excellent service. Outstanding seafood and steak. Make sure you reserve a table in advance. And please... PLEASE. Dont be that guy in shorts and flip flops. He looked out of place and plain wrong. My opinion. It's not black tie but it's a nice dinner place. Give it the respect it deserves.  Thank you Joe's! Loved it. Will be back for sure, next time we're in town.",

First all, the best bread basket! Their pretzel bread was so soft and moist inside almost like cheesy bread, and delicious corn bread muffin!  For appetizer, I got a grilled prawn, it was smokey outside but tender inside and the sauce that came with it was delicious! Better than mustard sauce! I also dipped my bread in this yummy dip. For entree, I didn't order a stone crab even though it's my favorite shell fish, usually toward the end of the season which is May, stone crabs are no longer fresh and not as good as the beginning of the season, so I ordered chilled crab legs. They were already cracked in the middle, so easy to get the meat out, and it was so sweet and lots of it! I love Joe's! You can't go wrong with Joe's!!",

We arrived just a few days into stone crab season and sampled both the stone crab and the Alaskan king crab. As great as stone crab is, I actually thought the Alaskan king crab was even better.  Our tabled tried a variety of entrees ranging from more crab to fish and steaks, and all were terrific. On one occasion, the filet mignon that was ordered wasn't exactly the best. It was both slightly flavorless but also undercooked. However, generally fantastic.  They have great pies. We tried key lime and peanut butter, both terrific. Great place, great service!",

But he looked like he didn't want to be at our table. More like he wanted to be at his other tables aka rich people tables. We look very young, celebrating our 1st year anniversary, maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him as much as those \"other people\". We are still customer, show us some respect will you!!!   so continuing, I asked about this certain dish that has salmon in it. it was called \" salmon de ...something\", but when I asked about it, he replied \"you don't know what a salmon is?\" SERIOUSLY, WOW great job Sherlock. of course, I know what a salmon is, but what's the dish about. is it...cooked, grilled, fried, seared, what!?!?!?!   *CLANK* So ordering is done. So my GF and I were talking while we were waiting for our food to come. And here comes our waiter out of no where with these metal bowls for our discarding shells, but he threw it on out table making this loud clanking noise. *CLANK*!!! no sorry, or excuse me, just \"here are these for your shells.\"   Just wanted a fancy dinner and celebrate our 1 year!!! I did not wanted this kind of experience on our special day!!!",

Not as fresh as in Miami, but that's to be expected. And their keylime pie is always awesome! To anyone going there, I'd suggest just sticking with the stone crab and the keylime pie, their staples. The stone crab is expensive though so be prepared. But it always is because it's seasonal and hard to get. We ventured off the basics and ordered lobster bisque, not that good, you can find better bisque elsewhere and the grilled seafood platter. The little lobster tails were very good, the scallops decent, and the gigantic shrimp, although impressive in size, weren't very good. The stone crab is worth it for the experience but know you'll pay for it.",

Not in the quality but the quantity.  Ordered the \"Roasted Cauliflower\" - dish came out with about 3 ounces of product on it - asked the server who said this was normal. For 9+ bucks - skip it.     Service - now this was extremely good.  Over the top in professionalism and attentiveness.  Joe's need to make sure they keep this staff - personable, professional, gracious - outstanding!

So my review is based on the other food (well the ones we ordered) so it may not reflect the general greatness of  Joe's.   We sat in their \"outdoor\" seating so we can people watch. Attentive service as per pro tool in any upscale Vegas restaurant. The lobster bisque was delicious. Tasty and not too salty. Creamy and satisfying. I opted for the seafood salad (but really I should've gotten the tacos). Small portions, lumps of cold crab and pieces of half shrimp with the shredded greens. I was not that impressed. The dish was pretty blah. We had a bottle of Rose to go with lunch. Not a bad deal for 60 bucks a bottle. The caesar salad was ok. Love that they use big fat anchovies with it. Though the salad was a bit on the tart side.  The prices were pretty steep. Our bill was almost 300 bucks, for lunch!! Thats pretty ridiculous. I could've gone to Per Se and gotten a solid meal for that price. It was ridiculous also considering that we ate salads! Wow. So personally I thick it's overpriced and overhyped.   I can cross this place off my list. Probably won't be gong back.",

Initially, I wasn't so sure as it was a bit dark and the entrance is inside Ceasars shopping area, but once your inside and begin to order, WOW!  Our waitress was amazing - she recommended all the best items beginning with the cucumber martini (AMAZING DRINK, like HEAVEN with seafood, just like she said and it got me tipsy) and my BF, being a whiskey man, ordered an extremely aged whiskey which he said was unbelievable. Started out with the 2nd Mortage featuring a little bit of everything ( their famous Alaskan King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Cocktail, Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche) - holy moly, SO worth the money!!! They are known for their crab for a reason- I could have had a giant plate of that alone and be satisfied! Glad I didn't tho...  We also got Oysters Rockefeller which may be the BEST Oysters I have ever had  And for the main course, Surf N' Turf! So far, we are drunk, stuffed, and in HEAVEN!  Waitress is still very attentive and although we are so full, my sweet tooth could not pass up the dessert menu. The waitress was kind enough to offer a half slice of their home-made chocolate fudge pie. NO GOOD! Literally could not stop eating.   Absolutely recommend this place as a fine dining establishment in Las Vegas and will certainly be back for more :)",

When you're in Vegas for work, and your business colleagues say they want to treat you to Joe's, do not, do not, I repeat do not assume you're going to Joe's Crab Shack.  Do not dress down because you're afraid the crab shells on the floor will stick to your heels and you bring your sunnies with you because you're afraid the neon lights will hurt your eyes.    Yes, that happened to me AND my boss, because we are such geniuses.    Back to the crab, this was my first stone crab experience, and it was enlightening.  I am from SF so crab is something I know, but stone crab...yummm, uncharted territory.  So sweet, so indulgent, so tasty, and coupled with that tangy mustard sauce?  Oh sweet heavens!  I also ordered the scallop dish that's wrapped in bacon...you really can't go wrong with that combo.  The scallops were of a monstrous proportion, and they wrapped the bacon around the scallops to make the whole dish look like a filet mignon.  Weird, but good.  My colleague had the crab cakes, and it took all of my will power to not eat her food when she went to the bathroom.  There were 8 other people sitting around the table, but still, it took a lot of strength.",

First, you start off the dinner with an amazing basket of bread, there's a great variety and everything was yummy, but my favorite was the flatbread.  They make it fresh at the restaurant, and it is super crispy and tasty.  Oysters on the half shell - amazing!  I loved all the sauces that accompanied it and the miniature tabasco sauce was super cute.  Also loved the stone crabs but felt like it was a bit overpriced, the best thing about them was the sauce.  Their seabass was cooked perfectly.  The only thing mediocre was the pork chop.  I guess you should stick to seafood here.  Overall, great dining experience, I'd definitely come back.",

Desserts are big enough to share but you won't want to, we really enjoyed the Boston cream pie and just about the best Key Lime pie ever.

    "text": "We decided to go here for dinner before the show at Caesars that night. Everything is a la carte, so when you order a steak, that's all you get. Sides are ordered separately, but each side will easily serve two people. I was in a party of five so everyone ordered their entrees and we had three side dishes, which was more than enough for my table. Our server was spot on and courteous. I would probably put him near or at the top of the list of the servers I have had.   We ordered a Stone Crab appetizer for all of us to share. It was the first time for me having Stone Crab and I didn't think it was the greatest. But I knew what I had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. It probably isn't something I would order again. I absolutely had to order the table-side chilled Alaskan King Crab legs with melted butter. I died and went to heaven several times over! I normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am I to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? It was so delicious I'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. I normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but I made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my crab legs. The side dishes were good too, which ranged from french fries to baked potatoes to macaroni and cheese to green beans. It was a fairly good list so I don't remember all of them.   It is a bit on the expensive side (my crab legs were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks. If you're lucky enough, you'll be able to pay for the entire meal with casino winnings. If you like Alaskan King Crab, this is definitely the place for you.",

Having dined at both,  I was a little disappointed to find the Las Vegas branch more \"corporate\" - the typical look and feel for an upscale steakhouse.  The fillet itself was not particularly memorable and having not been particularly impressed with the Stone Crab at the Miami location, I figured that I would give it another try.  I was more impressed with the thickness of the shell of the crab, dumb I know, but I came away with this experience realizing that I did not have an appreciation for Stone Crab, I simply can't tell the difference between it and it's more simple sibling, the crab.  The only real highlight was the crab and artichoke gratin appetizer - quite rich and gooey and I would order it again if I opted to try stone crabs for a third time, but honestly, I think I'll pass on them for something tastier.",

Yes, crab legs.  I ordered said legs, and our waiter took the liberty of bringing me the smaller portion, with the explanation that he thought I might want to start with the smaller plate, as I could always order more if I wanted. He was so right, my eyes being much bigger than my stomach, even though the king crab was really excellent. (And nicely pre-cracked so I could maintain a delicate and girly demeanor while wielding the little crab fork.)  We shared a bottle of champagne, very nice, and the stone crab appetizer. Stone crab is the specialty and great, though I preferred my legs. Someone at my table ordered oysters, also very good.  Our waiter was fantastic. In conversation, we found out he was a philosophy major and had lived in Chicago, where we're from, so we could have a chat about Chicago winters in the desert.",

From San Diego, I can goto the docks and pickup stone crab for $2.50 per stone crab, and I eat the whole thing (not just the big claw).  Here they were essentially charging $5 per claw, and that's it.    So ignoring the ridiculous stone crab, we ate this family style.  We came with a party of 10.  We ordered a few 24oz dry aged rib eyes which were very tasty.  They pre-sliced them into strips for us which was great for sharing.   We ordered enough King Crab legs for everyone to get a leg and some knuckles.    We ordered pretty much 1 of every side, along with some pork belly, shrimps and scallops.  We made quite a dent.  Someone had gotten lucky at the tables and paid for dinner, but I'm going to guess we spent about $100/head, and the food was great and we all left extremely stuffed.   They comped us some free spring onions, which were also pretty tasty :)  From everything we tried, I'd definitely recommend the dry aged rib eye (although you can get good steak almost everywhere on the strip these days.. I'm not gonna lie and say their steak was better than what you could have gotten at CraftSteak, Carnevino, Cut, Delmonico, Prime, etc...) and the king crab was good.  For the sides, I wasn't a huge fan of the fried asparagus, but I did enjoy the spring onions and broccolini.   I guess this place would be close to a 3.5 to me, but I'm bumping it up because I had a great time.",

    "text": "Generally we don't even try chain restaurants when we are in Vegas, simply because we feel like we can get that food outside of Vegas & we're afraid of being sorely disappointed. But, this being Vegas, we took a gamble and won BIG time!  My husband and our friend got the steak (chop) & the lobster.  As our friend put it, the lobster was both sweet with just a tad bit of saltiness for flavoring; it was succulent, and when dipped into the butter, simply divine. So, they moved to the steak, both of them were skeptical that they'd be impressed at all well, they were wrong. As my husband put it, the steak was so tender you barely even needed a knife to cut it; you could've just used the edge of your fork. The steak was tender, savory, and made to perfection.  Wow, right?   We also had the stone crabs because that's Joe's signature dish;  it definitely did not disappoint. Meaty and flavorful.  I had the grilled seafood platter with shrimp, scallops, & lobster tails. The one major problem with it was that I finished all of it and then it was gone. . I suppose it gave me a chance to dive into our sides:  mac & cheese, sauteed spinach, and stuffed mushrooms. Mac & cheese:  shell pasta struck the balance of firmness but not too hard, and the shape (I discovered) handily scooped up & held the cheese so that everything landed into my mouth. Stuffed mushrooms were also nicely done with the mushrooms retaining the flavor from the buttery stuffing & let's be honest, that's always a good thing.  And the spinach was my one vegetable, made extra delicious with seasoned butter-/or something like that. The staff was very helpful, knowledgeable, & engaging. She knew a couple members of our party were on a tight schedule so she got our order going quickly to get them fed and  out the door.  I have to say that I very much appreciated that, even after those 2 left, we were still made to feel welcome to sit and stay. There was no pressure at all to leave even though it was busy. Of course we then ordered desserts and coffee. Desserts:  generously sized, delicious, 'nuf said.   All in all, this was a surprisingly delightful find. And, of course, we will be back",

We sat at the bar where Stephanie the bartender was just as friendly, nice, engaging, and helpful as could be.  My wife ordered a glass of wine and I had a Manhattan with Knob Creek.  They use Carpano Vermouth in their Manhattan's which gives them a great flavor.  When I commented on the vermouth Stephanie gave me a sample to try.  Suffice it to say I will be using Carpano at home from now on!    The food was delicious my wife got the grilled octopus salad and I the fish and chips, almost went with the stone crab claws instead.  When the meal was over Stephanie brought us a special dessert on the house, ( we are celebrating my 60th).  These types of experiences are the reason we come to Las Vegas and Joe's exceeded our expectations!  Also thanks to Stephanie's recommendation we booked the show Absinthe.",

The 20 minute walk through the shops was forever (take the shortcut outside the front of the casino - 5 minutes) but when we got there, it made it worthwhile. We were disappointed to hear that the Crab was out of season but our server suggested the steak - which we ordered. The service could not have been better - the drinks perfect and the steak.....I would order again and again and again! In my opinion, this is one of the top restaruants at Caesars - even though they are NOT affiliated with the hotel other than renting space (you cannot charge it to your room).",

    "text": "A lot of people have been asking lately why I listed Joe's as the place I want to visit for my last meal. 'Nuff said: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=b_U71SJ8gwneofsDXbzzZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always pay a vist to Joe's. The service is good and the food is awesome. I was even impressed with their bread basket full of warm pretzel bread (my favorite), fennel/sesame flatbread, rye and cheese bread.   Get the CRAB CAKE appetizer ($14.95 lunch, $15.95 dinner): All meat-no filler. Big chunks of sweet, succulent dungeness crab served with Joe's special garlicky mustard sauce. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=n6r04azWZWg9ffBImFPVug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  Their sweet STONE CRAB CLAWS are my favorite type of crab to eat (yes, I prefer them over alaskan king crab). They're served cold and pre-cracked, with both the cocktail and mustard sauce, simple but so good!!    I either get them as a 4-piece appetizer (varies, market price):   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=5ngQjeAYWk9ByzBr2JmX7g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  or the 7-piece medium sized claws as my main entree ($32.95):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=un9EM4lEFuH4ZztXftLXVw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  SEAFOOD CHOP SALAD ($16.95 lunch,$18.95 dinner):  It's a meal in itself, enough for 4 people to share. Yummy chunks of lobster, king crab and shrimp piled high on a lightly dressed salad. I hate raw red onions more than anything, but the fresh sweet lobster made up for it.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=u2NxFIR6JKtfSzgDXUgRKQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  The BACON-WRAPPED SCALLOPS ($23.95 lunch, $26.95 dinner) are also a must try. 4 large perfectly cooked scallops are wrapped with bacon to mimic a filet mignon. 2 \"filets\" per order.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=kgykWS4E17qRgC8GtkLqYA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  The CRAB-STUFFED SOLE ($42) with asparagus was also yums and portions were huge (two decent sized filets wrapped into medallions). The fish was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The lobster sauce was undetectable, I could only taste the browned butter.  The side orders are huge, great for sharing. We usually order one or two at the most: SWEET CORN ($7.95) is always a favorite of mine. It's pan-roasted in butter and yet it still had a nice crunch to it.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I6EDDi4-Eq_XlFghcDCUhw?select=Fgo5Ao_9QEEmEyTyubSPQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/I6ED...</a>  JENNIE/JENNY MASHED POTATOES ($7.95): Rich but very yummy! Asiago cheese is mixed into the mash, then its topped with even more cheese and breadcrumbs!  Reservations is recommended but out of all the times I've been there, we've only rsvp'd once. The rsvp was for the booth in the main dining area, we sat at the bar area all the other times.",

What could be worse than that? Well, let me mention one other thing--I had to settle on a horrible stake sandwich that tasted, well, horrible--So dry that it has no flavor.

    "text": "First stop during Restaurant Week 2012 was Joe's Seafood. The place has an old-school atmosphere and a menu full of classic dishes. And, of course, their specialty... stone crabs. We got an order of stone crabs to start. They're cracked before coming to the table, which makes it easy to dig in and eat. There wasn't a ton of meat, but the meat that was there was tender and succulent. Just don't expect it to be as sweet as king crabs or snow crabs.  I dove into the RW menu after that starting with a bowl of stone lobster bisque with plenty of flavor and a slight kick. The tiny bits of celery added a variation in texture that was refreshing. It came in a large bowl that would have been good enough to share.   The 8oz filet was lightly seasoned, very tender, and slightly undercooked. The quality of the prime beef was evident, but it lacked the finishing touches that would have made it exceptional.  Sides of \"Jennie's mashed potatoes\" and steamed asparagus were brought for the table. The cheesy and chunky potatoes were a nice variation of the classic side and the breadcrumbs on top were an added bonus. The asparagus were standard. Nothing special, but I guess you have to have some green on your plate, right?  For dessert, I went with Joe's signature key lime pie. I love key lime pies in any form, so this one satisfied my craving. It was far from perfect, though. Too tart and a thick and uneven crust... maybe Joe should take hi name off of this dessert. I also tried my wife's dessert -- the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. Pretty good and had me thinking about candy canes a few months too soon.",

I had called for a reservation and the manager was very cool asked for a nice table, ie. not near the bathrooms. He told me he would take care of me.  And he did the table was a private corner table and he remembered me too. Nice guy.  We ordered a side of the large Stone Crabs 5 for $59.95. No need to order the crab legs.   And then me and my sis split the lobster tail and filet combo. Her man had the crab legs and filet combo. We ordered a side of mac n cheese, creamed spinach, and brocollini. OKAYYYY I never like American styled lobster... (rubber dipped with butter no thx) however this was not the case. The lobster was the star of the nite. So flavorful and delicious. Even splitting the combo the portion was huge. Mac n Cheese awesome yumminess, better than Gordon Ramsey Steak and dare I say Mastro's. Ordered the dulce leche dessert which was surprising light and sooo yummy.   Ohhh I forgot the cocktails... I forget the name but it is made with fresh peaches. A signature drink. Forget all others only order this drink. You wont be disappointed. I would come back just to drink at this classy bar.  The waiter did give us a tip bc we raved about the lobster. Always order the size that comes with the combo bc the bigger one you can order itself is not goood. I guess good things do come in small sizes... Lolx!   What can I say one of the best steakhouses on my list!! Great service and even better food. Stick to my tips people! You will eat good and save money from my mistakes",

After placing our orders, the entrees came out minus the sides.  Thinking they would be following right behind the meals, we waited approx. 5-10 mins. before catching the waiters eye.  Stating he thought they had been brought out, he went and got one of them. when asked about the other 2, he returned to the kitchen and completed our dinners, expressing how sorry he was about the mix up.  I am not opposed to paying high prices for a good meal, but I do expect everything about the dinner to run smoothly.",

It was one of the best seasoned and perfectly cooked(medium rare) steaks I've ever had. This is from a guy who has had Ruth's Chris and Mortons countless times. The service was perfect, we sat in the good fellas booth in the corner and felt like some OG's for sure. It's def pricey, that comes with the territory and is all well worth it. Check it out, unless you have trouble getting a table I doubt you'll find any reason to dislike this place.",

I had blackend scallops with a side of fried green tomatoes, my friends ordered scallops wrapped in bacon and a miso glazed bass.  The bacon wrapped sallops and the miso glazed bass were excellent  - juicy, cooked perfectly.  My scallops.....  not so good.. they were smaller and dryer than the bacon wrapped scallops.  The fried green tomoatoes were thick and heavily breaded - almost looked like crab cakes.  For dessert I had banana creme pie - which was excellent!

The wait staff were all extremely nice, as a joke he asked us if we wanted to take some of the bread back (because it seemed like we liked it so much)...but we really loved it..so he ended up giving us an entire box to-go so we can have something to snack on to go along which came in handy later on with all the drinking we did.  Super nice guy.  Usually it's probably a really tacky thing to do..but they did it with all smiles and good times, totally not a stuffy atmosphere.",

The waiter did a good job on recommending the desert, however, he made a mistake by getting me wrong kind of wine without telling me until I checked the bill. I specifically asked for the kind I wanted but in the end I was charged by another one, the more expensive one of course. :( Also, when I was trying to decide whether to try stone crab or the grilled lobster tail, he mentioned to me that they could \"offer\" me a small stone crab for taste with the grilled lobster tail. Again, he didn't tell me that I'd be charged for that until I saw the bill. Well, you can tell how upset I would be without knowing the details. I guess he could've been more careful and explained to the customers more clearly. I don't mind to pay but I do mind being charged without letting me know first.  The stone crab was good, loved the mustard dipping sauce, quite fresh. The lobster tail was quite disappointing, it was over cooked, burned quite a bit actually. :-( The banana walnut pie was delicious!! A must try!!  Overall, hate to say this but I don't think I will go back there again.   V.F.",

    "text": "Had a 6:30 Saturday evening reservation for an anniversary celebration.  The host wished us a happy anniversary when he looked up our reservation.  We were seated right on time.   Waiter was attentive and helpful.  Ordered a bottle of champagne and started with crab-cake appetizer and Caesar salad.  The crab-cake was very good except for one piece of lump crab that was slightly fishy.  Caesar salad was excellent.  However before we finished half of the appetizers they delivered our main courses.  As soon as our waiter noticed (he did not deliver the main courses) he came over.  We mentioned that never in all of our dinning experiences in up scale restaurants had we had our main courses delivered while we were still eating our appetizers.  By the way, we are reasonably fast eaters and were not dawdling other than to enjoy the champagne with the appetizers.  Our waiter apologized and took the main courses away.  Once we finished the appetizers he brought our main courses- the large size stone crabs and Joe's famous scallops.  The stone crab claws were excellent, the scallops uninspired.  We finished with one of their key lime pies and one of their coconut pies.  Both excellent.  Though we were surprised that no mention was made of our anniversary by the waiter nor a token candled cupcake as was delivered to a few nearby tables in celebration of birthdays.  So all in all an OK experience marred by the rush delivery of our main course.  Certainly not what we expect when spending several hundred dollars on a dinner.",

    "text": "Living in Maryland, there is nothing better than some blue crabs (with Old Bay of course) and beer on a nice summer night at the shore.  So I was really excited to try Joe's Stone Crabs on my recent trip to Vegas (I never made it when I was in Miami last year).    I first asked the waiter what a stone crab tastes like.  His reply \"a mix of crab and lobster.\"  After trying them, I would say that is a fairly accurate description.  While good, I prefer blue crab meat, which is much sweeter but maybe I am biased.  The ambiance was very nice.  Much like a steakhouse, as opposed to some type of Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville type place I was originally expecting.  The service was excellent. Our waiter called me \"sir\" every time, which is a nice touch and took the time to answer all of our questions.  (There is nothing worse than having a waiter with an attitude)  The best part of the night: the key-lime pie.  For some reason, I could not stop eating it, even though I was so full from dinner. Perhaps there is better key-lime pie out there, and maybe when I go to Key West this winter I will find out, but for someone from the northeast, it worked for me.  Overall, a good place to try if you are in Vegas.",

One of the best seafood restaurants in Las Vegas Joe's always offers outstanding food, fantastic service, and a fabulous beer, wine, and  cocktail menu. My wife and I have been to Joe's several times and had the stone crab (of course!), the alaskan king crab, calamari steak, sauteed shrimp, and every time it has been utterly delicious. The wine menu is really decently priced for a higher end Las Vegas  restaurant. One of our favorite wines that complements seafood perfectly is the Conundrum which is a white wine varietal (blend). A unique feature of Joe's is the bar area. The bar offers everything the formal dining room offers but in a more casual and relaxed setting, thus making it a perfect spot if you want a great meal but are in flip flops and full casual attire. Try Joe's seafood you will be very glad you did. Cheers!",

    "text": "Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab is possibly my most favorite restaurant anywhere.  I've been eating here two or three times a year for many years now.  It's not uncommon to make a trip to Las Vegas just to dine at Joe's and turn around and go back.  Located in the Forum Shops at Ceasars Palace (did you know that there is no apostrophe used in Ceasars Palace because the owner when it opened said that all guests entering were Ceasar).  Joe's interior has the look of an old school but high-end steak house.   Booth's are located in dark corners; old photos of Joe's origin restaurant in Miami adorn the walls, low ceilings, ornate light fixtures and a sample of Joe's large selection on wine is displayed along one long wall as you enter.  Joe's has large and varied menu featuring a selection of prime steaks, crab, lobster, and salads.  Every thing is al a carte so sides are served family style and generally large enough to serve the table depending on the size of your party.  I've sampled the rib eye and lobster but the reason I keep going back to Joe's is for the Alaskan King Crab.  The dinner portion features a 1  1/2 lbs. of the largest crab legs I've ever seen.  Crab is usually tough meal due to the amount of work to free the sweet and succulent crabmeat from the spiny shell.  Once you're done leveraging your sheller and cracker you end up with a pile of crab flakes on your plate.  Not at Joe's they make it easy for you by cutting the shells open tableside.  It's a great show.  All you have to do is use your fork to pull out the meat, dip in the drawn butter and enjoy.  I've searched wide and far for other restaurants that serve crab in the same way and have failed miserably.    Joe's sides and desserts are good too.  There is a large selection of potato dishes to choose from and vegetables ranging from roasted corn, asparagus, Brussels spouts and Sauteed Spinach.  The dessert menu features Key Lime Pie and pie of the month (April 2016 was Strawberry Ice Cream Pie), sundae's and other baked confections.    The staff at Joe's is always friendly, knowledgeable and ready to help you make the right entree or wine selection.  You will never lack for a refill of any drink.  Meals are delivered promptly and prepared expertly to your specifications.  If you are enjoying red meat you'll find the temperature is perfect (medium-rare is really medium-rare).    There are a lot of dining in Las Vegas but for my money Joe's is hard to beat.",

The waiters are dressed in professional attire.  The pretzel bread was delicious along with the corn bread in the bread basket. We started with THE WHALE, which is shrimp, king crab, lobster, and shrimp & scallop ceviche all chilled served with drawn butter. Seriously the best seafood platter I've ever had. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly. The ceviche comes with chips that are seasoned so well I ate them all!  For our entrees we each got the filet with lobster tail. The filet was decent, but the lobster tail made this dish. Our server was kind enough to cut the meat from the shell. Our sides were the mac n cheese which was to die for. So cheesy and scrumptious! And a baked potato.   We were way too full for dessert, but Joe's has a long list of pies to choose from if you still have room! Overall the experience was good and the food delicious. I will definitely be back!",

They gave a variety of different breads for us to eat while we waited for our food. We went for my friend's birthday and we dropped off a cake earlier on in the day and they respected our requests. They take reservations and we were a little late for ours but they allow a 30 minute grace period which is generous considering how many ladies I was with and took forever to get ready. It didn't take long before the waiter took our orders and then an average wait time til we got our main courses. It was a bit pricey but I feel it's more for the presentation. The fried chicken I had was delicious and breaded evenly all around. The steaks my friends got were cooked to perfection so I would suggest getting it next time.",

My brother and I had the stone crab, my sister in law the crab stuff prawns. Everything is just outstanding. Fortunately my brother couldn't finish his claws, so I got 2 bonus claws!!!!  This is always my favorite place to eat, and I take visitors here as much as possible. I've been eating here since 2004 or so. Used to be my ex's and I's Anniversary place, but we got divorced so now its just me. And I couldn't be happier!!!  Thanks Joes for all the memorable and delicious meals.",

    "text": "On our vacation in Vegas, the boyfriend and I decided to have a nice romantic dinner at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  It was the perfect spot to go to for some alone time as we did come on this trip with a group of our friends. It was already kind of late but luckily Joe's was open till 11pm.  We walked in and they were able to take us right away thankfully.  We got served a nice hot basket of assorted bread.  It even had cornbread in it with chunks of corn in it!  That was the best bread basket I've seen (yes bread is my weakness).  Our waiter let us take our time in our orders but was a little slow with serving us and checking on our table.  Not a big deal though.  The food was delicious!  I ordered a seafood platter which came with a lobster tail, shrimp scampi and scallops.  It was surprisingly a good amount of seafood.  My boyfriend got the filet mignon and crab.  Honestly, the portion size was smaller than I expected but it all tasted good so not complaining.  We also ordered a side of broccoli and their baked potato with roasted onion sour cream which was pretty damn amazing. Something about that onion sour cream.    Their stone crab is what they are known for and honestly wish we had ordered it.  But we already had a pretty filling dinner.  I guess we'll just have to come back and try it next time!  The boyfriend and I enjoyed everything in our meal, including our dessert.  We opted for the gluten-free brownie sundae.  Sounds like an average dessert but it was oh so good and they give you not just 1 but 2 brownies!  It was very moist and chocolatey.. totally hit the spot :)  They also were very generous on the ice cream (I hate places that give you very little ice cream!).  Overall I enjoyed Joe's and would definitely come back here again if I were ever in Vegas again.  Yes this place is a fine dining restaurant but I thought the price was reasonable.  Even with our drinks it wasn't so bad!  Great spot to check out when you're in Vegas!",

No mention from server, etc of wishing my mother a Happy Birthday.  Why ask if you are celebrating a special occasion if you do nothing with the info? We ordered Jumbo Crab Claws, they were not great. In fact, we didn't even finish them. At $89, they should be perfect. In addition, I was up with an upset stomach quite a bit that night. Not sure if the crab was what made me sick or not. I was sorry to have this kind of experience at Joe's. I've been to the Miami location countless times and have always experienced excellent service and food. My mom has never been and I was really looking forward to sharing the Joe's experience with her. Really disappointed in the Vegas version of Joe's.",

Every bite of both meals was superb and well presented.  Our meals came with desserts as well, and were the Havana Pie and the Banana Cream pie, both incredibly good. My son said his Havana Pie (neither of us had ever heard of this type of pie) was now his new favorite dessert. He loved it so much. In short, ALL FOOD HERE IS INSANELY fresh, excellent quality, and delicious!!  Great food is always what we hope for in a new restaurant experience, but a server can also make such a difference. In our case, JOHN S, made our already wonderful experience, a MEMORABLE one as well!!!  In fact, every staff member we encountered was on top of their game and so professional. THANK YOU ALL at Joes Seafood for making a beautiful lifetime memory for us!!!!",

Our table was ready right when we arrived.  Once seated, the drinks and yummy complementary bread and butter came out.  All of the breads were so yummy we asked for another.  For dinner, we weren't super hungry so we shared a Crab Bisque ($10), Scallops ($37), and Selected Stone Crabs ($50).  The Crab Bisque was out of this world amazing.  The bowl came empty with just some celery and other ingredients in it.  The actual bisque was poured in our bowl by our friendly waiter.  It was full of flavor and was delicious with our complementary breadds.  It's definitely worth getting and actually cheap for what you get.  I highly recommend it.  The Seared Sea Scallops came out sitting on some sort of potato cake.  These were also amazing.  I think there were about six of them and all of them were seared perfectly.  I would totally order this again.  And lastly their famous Stone Crabs.  I love that it was broken for you so you all you need to do is dunk them in the sauce it came with and eat.  Yum!  The meat was super sweet and super fresh.  So good!  Our total was about $120.  I thought pricing was very reasonable.  Everything on the menu was fresh and delicious.  As for service, our waiter was very friendly.  He made great recommendations.  All our requests were made quickly.  I really want to come back to try their other items and maybe for lunch or happy hour.  Everyone needs to try this place if you love seafood.",

With a sweet English accent, she lovingly greeted everyone and ordered our meal to the delight of our British relatives that came in to celebrate Christmas with us. Halfway through dinner I received a sad phone call from my bestie who is suffering from throat cancer and I could hardly understand her. The tears flowed and Linda was right there with a box of tissues. She was intelligent, very funny and witty and empathetic. Thank you for having such a wonderful server in your dining room.

And that was the feel of the whole evening.  No class.  The waiter greeted us and then came back ten minutes later just barely remembering to ask if we had any questions. The bill was just north of $400 for two with no drinks.  Both of our steaks that we both ordered medium where still moving when they got to the table.  If you're charging $70 plus for a steak you should he know how to cook it.  We sent them back and got medium well not medium.  The guy who I guess was a manager gave a half hearted apology as he returned our now mutilated steaks. The crab legs where great.  The stone crab was mealy and the Madagascar shrimp as always was to die for.  We loved Joes before this but after this trip we don't see ourselves going back.  For the money we should've gone to Michaels at south point.",

Unless you're my date... then you'll need help with getting the meat out in one piece :P The dip it came with was so creamy and delicious. Perfect combination.  x Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - THE BEST crab cakes I've ever had in my life. SOOOO much flavor and SOOO much meat. Pretty much ZERO filler. Highly recommend for you crab lovers. This was probably my favorite of the night. x Chopped Seafood Salad - refreshing with lots and lots of fresh seafood. Generous amounts of each ingredient and was the perfect crunch to all the mush we were eating.

They are huge and there was SO much meat! Then we split a lobster tail which was also incredible. Our service was top notch as well, our waitress brought out a dessert with a candle because she saw on my husbands ID his birthday was the day before our visit, now THAT is proactive service, we were blown away that she took the time to notice that and make our dinner even more special. So glad we stopped here and will definitely be back next time we're in vegas",

My husband and I made reservations for our anniversary ahead of time to enjoy during our trip to Vegas. The staff was so attentive and phenomenal. We never had to ask for a refill and the recommendation of the Chilean Sea Bass was a hit with us both. The bass was so tender and buttery. It had a Asian flare to it with the spices and was so delicious. We ordered the Mac and Cheese and a sweet potato for sides. I wasn't a fan of the bok choy due to personal preference. Our server even provided a free dessert as a treat for our anniversary. I will definitely return when I visit the area again. Worth every penny!",

The complimentary bread was nice as well to start out. We started with the Caesar salad and the bone-in ribeye + the Mac & cheese for our entree/side. Finished off with the HALF ORDER (which was huge!) of apple pie + ice cream.   For all of that our bill was $112, which is very fair, especially for a Vegas steakhouse where you could spend that on just one person.   Pros: -good atmosphere  -great choices  -fairly priced   Cons: -seating is small and a bit uncomfortable",

I tried some of my boyfriend's mac and cheese and it was pretty good too. It was also buttery, creamy, and cheesy. Since the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese are both pretty big and heavy, I would recommend making sure that you have people to share it with.   Although I had a great time eating my food, my boyfriend's mom didn't. She got food poisoning from the raw oysters she ordered. I would rate the food I tried 4 stars, but I docked off a star because their oysters definitely were not fresh.",

I've heard of John Dori on Hell's Kitchen many times so when I saw it on the specials board I figured I should give it a try.  So I ordered it with their fried asparagus and for a potato to go with it I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said that Joe's is known for their hash browns.  I tought, \"Hash browns with fish?\", but the waitress said it was great.  The fish was served in a brown butter sauce that was quite heavy.  I think that my body being used to eating relatively clean most of the time meant that I was not ready for the richness of the food.  Butter sauce on the fish, fried asparagus and fried potatoes left me feeling a bit sick after the meal.  The service was good but I wasn't very impressed with the food this time.",

Tucked away into a deep and distant corner of the Forum mall is an 'old school'-feeling restaurant which throws down massive crab claws on your plate for appropriately high prices.  I have been two times, and haven't strayed beyond the crab, fried green tomatoes, and more crab.  Maybe I had a soup on my first visit, but if I did it was a mistake as it took up room better used on crab!  My first visit featured stone crab, my second was rock crab I think, whatever- I'm not sure I know the difference, and both were simply amazing portions of robust claws.  Most recently my 5 claw portion was so hefty I struggled to knock the $50ish entree out.  These weren't grimy crab dishes where you are doing lots of work on small obscure parts of the crab's back, hip, or spindly legs, etc- but instead these are BIG picture-perfect claws (only), pre-cracked, and filled with delicious meat.     I'm sure the other offerings are great, but I can get a steak many places, and the fish entrees were not so unique to catch my attention.  But come and eat crab, and I'm sure you will leave a happy camper.  I'll be back sooner or later.",

The Steaks are fantastic and don't forget to put some of the seasoning on that they bring to the table, it is a mixture of salt pepper and other seasonings.  My favorite side is the Mac & Cheese, WHICH IS THE BEST IN VEGAS!  Don't let the fancy digs fool you, they know how to make a great classic Mac & Cheese.",

    "text": "I got crabs this past weekend in Vegas...Joe's Stone Crabs, that is; what else did you think I was talking about?!   This was my first time having stone crab claws & I thought they were just so-so. The texture was a little like a flakey white fish, dense & less sweet than Dungeness crab meat (my fave kind.) At over $10 per Large claw (an order comes with five), a taste of Joe's does not come cheap. And the mustard sauce (spicy from the horseradish) was good, but I'm going to call 'overhyped' on their namesake dish.   The three of us also shared a crab cake entree ($24, too much breadcrumb filler), a salad & the 'Second Mortgage' appetizer ($16) which was the best thing we tried. I especially liked the jumbo prawn & shrimp & scallop ceviche that was included in the appetizer.   Service from everyone we encountered was five stars-- very professional, but given that I've had better crab cakes at The Palm a few doors down & the stone crabs hit my wallet pretty hard, I'm giving their food a lukewarm three stars.  Getting (stone) crabs in Vegas-- not so yummy.",

We did a late lunch on a Sunday and were presented the lunch menu as it was around 3 pm. I asked about the lunch special that I had read about before, and our server Greta informed us of the two options of tenderloin or king crab legs. We ordered one of each, and I couldn't wait for some claws. Greta told us that there were only jumbos available, $75 for 3 was just too much for me.  We did the 3 course lunch and it was phenomenal, possibly the best meal I have ever enjoyed! I had the king crab with lyonnaise potatoes and roasted corn. My sweetheart had the tenderloin with the Jennie's special potatoes. The lunches came with pie that we took back to the room but it didn't survive the night unfortunately. The service from Greta and team was right on the money. All this awesome food with a tequila and grapefruit type specialty drink and a soda came in under $70! Can't wait to go back again!!!!!!",

    "text": "Joe's is expensive but worth every penny, in our opinion. It was a great way for my husband and I to kick off our long weekend in Las Vegas.   Service was excellent. Our server was chatty but not intrusive. He went above and beyond not once, not twice, but THREE times when we could not make up our minds--first by showing us and explaining the different sizes of stone crab claws, second by asking the sommelier when we couldn't decide on a wine, and third by suggesting we could get half portions of 2 desserts instead of choosing 1.  Food was excellent. The stone crab appetizer was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and this is from a person who doesn't usually care for cold seafood. For dinner, I had a huge piece of bone-in halibut that was seared to perfection. My husband had the bone-in fillet and pronounced it one of the top 5 steaks he has ever eaten. The broccolini we shared as a side dish was cooked just right--not too crisp, not too soft. For dessert, we shared half portions of the key lime and banana cream pies. The dessert portions were just right, not to mention the generous pot of coffee they left on our table.  Ambiance was what you would expect for an upscale steakhouse. The only negative--and I'm being very nitpicky--would be the attire of our fellow restaurant patrons. We are not prudes by any means, and we know Vegas is a big vacation destination, but this is Joe's, not Steak & Shake. Don't you think you should change out of the shorts and t-shirts you've been walking around in all day before coming to a place like this?",

I still didn't gamble and I had TWO drinks at the lounge earlier tonight O_O  I thought to myself, at first, that Vegas should have decent food right???  After a couple days of culinary disappointment, I found myself very glad to have Saturday night dinner be at my place of choice.  The bread basket, though cold, was still enjoyable.  Appetizer: Crab bisque was delightful; rich, creamy, and filled with chunks of crab. I was thoroughly satisfied.  Entree: My 20 oz bone-in rib eye, per James L.'s recommendation, was the piece of culinary delight I had been waiting for since my trip began. I was even lucky enough to have at least two bites of that delicious, creamy steak fat with the crispy edges. I enjoyed the steak so much that I intentionally spilled some steak juices on my shirt so that I could enjoy my steak later that night.   Tip: Use the salt seasoning that accompanies the steak very conservatively! Our server offered me a side of bernaise sauce which complimented the steak rather nicely ^_^  Dessert: Oh my my... Key Lime Pie is one of my favorite desserts and Joe's is the best I've ever had! The perfectly balanced sweet and sour, lime filling was supported by the most perfectly crumbly graham cracker crust...  I moaned so loud that an older couple turned around in shock/abhorrence; I guess they did not deem such pleasured moans appropriate within of confines of the restaurant. My server, Darrel, however, was more than thrilled that we enjoyed our meals.  My friend got the \"Havanna Dream\" which was Joe's rendition of a Tres Leches cake that was almost as orgasmic as my key lime pie.  My portion of the bill only added up to about $80ish after tip... :) I was more than happy with what I paid for.  From this point on, trips to Vegas will never be complete without a proper meal at Joe's.",

I am not a huge fan of stone crab, but they do have a great selection of seafood from oysters to halibut. Always been happy with the dishes. Only disappointment I have had was the last server we had last week. She was very short and rude. Dropping the menu on the table and telling us the specials were on there. Very bad service. Until she saw that we were willing to spend money there. Both of us being servers, we were very disappointed.  Either way, I will be back for sure! Make sure I will go when Linda is there! ;)",

The sweet roasted corn, which we were told by the server was a house signature dish, was good, but nothing exciting.  The crab bisque soup was good, but not the best.  The prices were on the steep side, but very typical for a strip restaurant.  We will go back, but not anytime soon.  This was a good experience, but not a great one.  Maybe it's because we eat out a lot and have had the good fortune to experience some great food, but over all this place is good, but not great.",

The steak (m-r) was tender, tasty and indeed 16oz.  It was not the very best I've had, that distinction is firmly held by Kinzie Chophouse in Chicago.  But this was very, very good. (A-).  The king crab was also great.  Expertly cracked, plentiful and served with drawn butter. (Also an A-).  We had onion strings as a side.  OK, but I recommend something else. (C).  My wife had the fish tacos and they were very good. (A-).  We were seated immediately without reservations, so no issue there and our server was attentive and very helpful in getting me the off the menu combo I wanted. (A).",

Our table had the stone crab claws, the other parties had the seafood salad and shared my creamed spinach. Normally creamed spinach doesn't really sound appealing but this spinach was off the hook. Seriously, so delicious and I'm sure it's the most overlooked item on the menu.  My lunch special finished with the Havana dessert. So delicious with a caramel drizzle on top. Go for it!

All of the people who attended to our table, were very nice and courteous.  The restaurant was also very, very clean.  Now, I started with a bowl of Manhattan Clam Chowder, which is one of my favourites.  And it was one of the best I've ever had.  It tasted so fresh.  It had great flavour and it was loaded with veggies and clams.  Now for my entree, I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon.  It might have been the worst steak I've had in a restaurant of this caliber.  The outside of the steak was completed charred and tough.  And I ordered it Medium Well, which usually means mostly pink, but not red.  However, this steak was very \"well done\".  I wanted to send it back and had I been the one paying for the meal, I would have.  However, I did not want to cause an issue, or embarrass the person paying the check.  So, I just asked for some Sauce Bernaise.  At least that made the steak bearable.  One of the others in my party had a Grilled Seafood Platter, which looked incredible and he said it was.  I'll be getting that the next time I go.  My sister had the Halibut, and it was beautiful and she enjoyed that.  For dessert, I split the Boston Creme Pie with someone else in my party.  It was incredible.  It is so hard to find these days, and I don't know why?!  It's such a great desert.  My sister had the Pumpkin Chiffon, which also was great.  So, if you're going to go here (and I recommend it), stick with the seafood and stay away from the beef.",

    "text": "Before I start on everything that was unacceptable, I would like to mention that our server, Mindy, was outstanding and the steaks were good.  That being said, a great dinner experience requires that all aspects of the restaurant be on point.  We arrived early so we could all have a drink only to be told by the host at the front that we could not sit at any of the open tables in the bar; they were reserved for people wanting dinner.  Joe's, you disappointed me with your terrible customer service!  Those tables sat empty the entire time.  You could have made money if you had let us start our evening off right with a round or two of cocktails for 12.  My party of 12 was placed in seating for 8 - I made this reservation over a month ago!  I should not be crammed into my seat with a $1600 dinner bill.  The gentleman (?) who assisted our waitress was unbelievably rude to the females at the table.  He ignored our requests and questions and shoved his way through us to collect dishes and glasses.  If it had not been my daughter's birthday I would have walked out.  Better to have gone out another night of vacation, to another restaurant, with better service.  Joe's, you lost our future business.  Mindy, you are the only reason this review got one star as your service was the only bright spot.",

    "text": "Joe's Prime Steaks and Stone Crab in the new Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace is awesome!  The stone crab is incredible! We ordered 4 large for two people and they were fresh! The sauce on the side is really good on the crab meat.  But they are good on their own as well.  All of our dishes were extraordinary. The seafood is fresh and the prime steaks are delectable.   For appetizers we had Shrimp De Jonghe (Extra large shrimp roasted in seasonings) , Fried fisherman's platter (enough for 2 but too much for one) and Caesar's Salad. Dinner was even better.   PROS:   Stone Crab (Large) Bone in Filet  (mouthwatering Tempura Fried Lobster Tails (came with 2 tails dipped in a very light tempura batter served with a sweet sauce).  Ribeye Steak Peanut butter cheesecake with chocolate sauce and crust.   If you are torn between seafood and steak, Joe's is your place for both.   If you drive to Caesar's Palace there is valet parking right at the front door of Joe's from the new Forum Shop entrance. If you are taking a cab, tell the driver to drop you off there or you will walk a long way from the Forum Shop entrance by the casino.  The location is in the newest wing of the Forum Shops. They have patio seating (inside the mall) and a huge beautiful restuarant with dark woods giving it a classic contemporary look. I reccomend sitting on the patio for great people watching.",

It reminds me a bit of Musso and Franks in Hollywood, only with excellent food. Service is always friendly and professional. The interior is what I'd call a masculine upscale type of place. White table cloths, dark wood, black and white photos on the walls. I still haven't tried the stone crab claws. I keep ordering the steaks because they are perfect. yes, perfect. I recently tried the crab cakes and they are about as good as I've had. I'd really like to have them back to back with Vic and Anthonies. I also just tried the fish and chips at lunch, it's the best in town. They use halibut and it is perfectly fried, crispy outside, tender inside. I've never had better. Cocktails are excellent and they have one of the best bloody mary's in town and save room for desert, they are all excellent too. If you like coconut cream pie, I think theirs is one of the best ever.",

Stone crab was frozen and virtually inedible. Sent back some that were really bad and the replacements were just as bad. Service has been poor as well. I always ask for a high top in the bar yet they make you wait even when tables are available.

Overall the seafood was fresh and I would imagine most everything on the menu would be a safe bet.  Personally i'd avoid the non seafood items since this place is called Joe's SEAFOOD Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  We just ordered a single large crab claw to try it (it's really pricey like 5-7 bucks for one claw).   I have to say that it was delicious though, and it makes me wish I was rich and could just order a giant tub of the claws and go to town.  :P",

The waiter, Patrick, was an awesome server. He was very personable and recommended many dishes for us to try. The busser was just as awesome, as he was talking hockey with my brother and I. There was 5 of us, and although a lil pricey, it was worth every penny. The petit filet was cooked perfect and it melted in my mouth. The lobster tail was just as succulent. My mom and fiancee had the stone crab and they both enjoyed them very much. My son had the crab bisque, which was dynamite. Patrick sent us on our way with two free pieces of pie. We will be back very soon.",

The concierge at the Wynn recommended this restaurant. Excellent choice. Restaurant located in the Cesar hotel complex. Taxi driver dropped off directly in front of restaurant.   The maitre de was expecting me. Thank you concierge. I think I got better service because of it. Yes I did give him $10 to say thanks for looking after me.  Originally they were going to set me in the mall area but I declined and they moved me to the bar area.  I just did not want to sit next to a table with a couple of rough guys in tank tops. Come on this is an upscale restaurant. How about a collared shirt.  Ok menu is diverse lots to choose from. I could not make up my mind so I ordered the fishermans platter. Great suggestion by waitress Laurie.  You can get it grilled or fried  i was naughty  went for the fried option  i enjoyed  it  Crab bisque soup interesting needed a bit of salt and pepper.   Bottom line would I go back maybe so many places to explore here in Vegas   You won't go wrong here",

The staff here is not pretentious, is very friendly, and attentive. The service is what made my visit here extremely enjoyable (plus the stone crab mmmmmmmmmm)  Everything I ate here during my visit was delicious. We had some bread.. (ok, I normally don't eat bread so it was actually my partner who ate bread). It kind of disappoints me when some places serve cold bread :(. Well, it wasn't cold, but bread usually tastes better when it's warm in my opinion.  We got the Stone Crab appetizer I think. 7pc of deliciousness!! I wish I had some in front of me right now. I wonder, does the body of a Stone Crab taste good? Where is the body?? It'd be a waste of delicious crab meat if the Stone Crab body IS edible, yet not sold :(  Caesar salad was good. But it's just caesar salad.  My petite filet came out. It was a nice medium rare but for some reason I didn't like the sear on the edges of my steak, I think it was too tough for me or .. something. It was still good though.   The partner got a nice hunk of meat! NY Strip! Holy moly this piece of meat was THICK!!!!! He looked very satisfied when he devoured it.  2 Sides we ordered were the Broccolini and Mashed Potatoes. Broccolini will always be delicious.. sauteed in garlic. The Mashed Potatoes was alright... it was too cheesy for my liking. If you love potatoes and love cheese, then I think you'll definitely like this side dish.  I should have gotten the hash browns or something.   For dessert, le partner ordered the Banana Cream Pie because he has this undying love and addiction for bananas. The sauce they put on this dessert is freakin good! Tasted like toffee or something.  I just had a cup of berries, because well, I like berries.  Overall, fantastic dinner. Food was great and the service was impeccable.",

My wife and I went for lunch around noon and the restaurant was about half full.  We ordered our drinks/meals and everything was fine at that point.  That is when the trouble started.  First off, any Joe's veteran knows about the crack-crack-crack method for easily eatable crab when done correctly.  However, my order of stone crabs appeared to be just CRUSHED with a sledgehammer.  I spent almost my entire time removing teeny tiny bits of shell from each bite I took.  It was terrible.  Secondly, about the time our food arrived, the restaurant was completely filled.  Not sure if they understaffed on purpose or not, but that was the result.  Drinks went unfilled, napkins could not be obtained, and the check took forever.  Having been to Joe's enough to know the potential, this was a severely dissatisfying experience.  As a general rule, when I am paying a premium (and at Joe's, you WILL pay a premium) for my seafood, I expect a quality meal that simply put, was not delivered for many reasons.  I will probably try them again and see if this was an anomaly or not.",

    "text": "Joe's gets a solid 4 stars from me.    I agree with Keith, the food is a bit pricey--those little stone crab claws are reaching for the loot.  Though, I think $36 for a 12oz USDA Prime filet mignon is a great deal!  Starting from the beginning, we were seated immediately (being a Tuesday evening, things on the Strip aren't too lively).  The wait staff are very neatly dressed in suits with white linen napkins draped over their arms.  We were told the specials and were even given recommendations from our knowledgable waiter.  Let it be known, he never tried to up-sell us or push menu items on us, which I think is very professional.  We share a caesar which was nothing fancy.  It consisted of the normal chopped romaine, croutons, and large thin slices of parmesan, all tossed in a very light caesar dressing (almost similar to a vinigrette).  It seemed like a small portion, even for being the \"shared\" size.  My entree was the 12oz filet mignon which was cooked to perfection--medium.  It was at least an 1 1/2\" thick!  Todd ordered the petite filet with stone crab.  This was the first time Todd has eaten stone crab and he isn't quite sure what all the hype is about?  While he had his own petite filet, he also tried mine and said, \"I think my steak was better.\"  Overall, our entrees were plated very nicely but kind of lacked flavor.    Our sides with our meals consisted of: 1) pan roasted sweet corn--simple, yet good 2) steamed asparagus with lemon butter--needed seasoning, bland 3) macaroni & cheese--very good, baked, light crumb topping  I'm not sure if I'd revisit Joe's for the simple fact of the number of restaurants that out-flavor Joe's.  But how I do wish other restaurants of Joe's caliber had the same top-notch service!",

The waitress also suggested we  try the fried chicken bc it was a house speciality. It was decent, however for the price I would have rather tried something else.

We were starving because it was dinner time back in Brooklyn and we had flown through lunch. Thank the merciful heavens for the loveliness that is Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crabs. We started with a appetizer-size order of the claws themselves. They were perfectly fresh and sweet.  I ordered the fried chicken and it was all killer, no filler. You might need a friend to help you finish, though because it must have been half a five pounder. Not that I'm complaining. It was great.  The bar makes a nice cocktail and the prices are usual for a traditional steakhouse (think $30 entrees). If you want a real treat, Joe's is worth the splurge. We certainly felt like \"high rollers\".",

I also ordered the lamb chops, those had to be taken back. While it was juicy, it was so heavily salted (and I love my salt) I was still tasting the sodium minutes after having a bite.

We only have one suggestion when ordering the Alaskan King Crab it is automatically served chilled, we recommend that they inform the guest of how it's served by the chef and perhaps offer the option of having it steamed or chilled.  Our preference is served warm, not a big deal, however it's always nice to have a choice.  :)  We'll be back",

The maitre'd seemed like he had no idea what reservation I was talking about.  He said there were three Pharma companies present, but he didn't know what the names were, he invited one of my colleagues to peruse the dining area to see if she could find the group (incredibly tacky), but if you are visiting and you don't know who you're meeting, how is that helpful?  I've been to multiple Pharma dinners, including Joe's in Chicago, and they always leave the name of the company because an attendee may not know the name of the person who made the reservation.  Then when more of our party arrived, he told us we would have to wait because they were very busy.  The rest of the evening was good, but the opening experience just put a sour taste in my mouth.",

Prices were reasonable, but the food was nothing to write home about.  I have had much better at other steakhouse.  I ordered the filet and mac and cheese.  The filet was good, but nothing special...I could do better.  The mac and cheese had no flavor and was very basic.  Being that this is in the Caesars Palace shops, I would expect a lot more from this restaurant.  They are also known for their crab, which I did not have.  With all of the steak houses in Vegas, I will not return here.",

Appetizers: We had crab, oysters and calamari at the table.  I didn't eat the first two (not my thing) but others said crab was good, not mind-blowing.  The calamari was fantastic, no chewiness and cocktail sauce was great.    Main course:  I had grilled halibut steak, which was absolutely kickass; cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and HUGE. I could barely eat half of it.  Others had parmesan halibut (she loved it) Mahi (he liked it very much) and steak (she loved it).   Sides:  Everything here shined.  Roasted corn was BOMB, green beans were perfect, and their signature mashed taters with crunchy topping were great.  Why I don't make my mashed potatoes with a crunchy topping I don't know.   Dessert:  we each had a few bites of their tres-leches-like cake (not sure what the actual name was) with a caramel sauce on top which I could've eaten two servings of.  We also tried their key lime pie, which was good, but not out-of-this-world or anything.  Overall, very good experience and I would definitely go back!",

They are so meaty, served cold, and already cracked so you just have to find the right way to peel the shell so you can get that one masterful piece.  Ordered the 3 large stone crab claws + hash browns + coleslaw + key lime pie for just $29.99, and added the $1 bowl of stone crab bisque. Everything was really tasty.  Location was in the mall in Las Vegas and it was pretty chill during the Lunch hour. We ended up just eating at the bar, and you can people watch a little bit.  For drinks it was the south beach peach, and a sweet & salty dog... both i was pleased with.",

You can't go wrong with either the steaks or the crab. The leyonaise potatoes we ordered as a side for dinner were outstanding.  Service was quite good and attentive at lunch, but was far less impressive at dinner. It took 15 minutes to get a drink order in after being seated. The place was jammed, but this needs to be better.  The tab for dinner for the 8 of us was about $1900. One of our group had a rewards card, but management declined to apply any credit to the card because another of our group paid for the dinner, in spite of the fact that the person with the rewards card had eaten at this restaurant three times this past week, having spent a few thousand dollars there in that week. While I agree that this makes sense, it was not handled particularly well by the staff. The waitress stated flatly, \"I can't do that. I need to keep my job. I have two babies to feed at home.\" The manager did not really do any better- he just said flatly, no.  So, in summary, good food. Customer service needs to be better, especially when we bring thousands of dollars in business your way in a week.",

We both felt ill the next day, and was pretty sure it was from the 2nd morgage appetizer. It was delish- don't get me wrong, I even took pics!    Anyhow, after asking me a few questions, she asked me when was the last time I ate prior, and told her at Red Rock Buffet for breakfast. The manager then asked me \"How much did you two drink by the pool\". We are locals here- and I was highly offended. We live in Summerlin and went there for breakfast, you can't beat a made to order  ommelette  and  coffee for 5 bucks! So I wrote a note to corporate, and the Las Vegas General Mgr. got in touch with me and stuck up for his manager. Poor customer service, every single person I ran this by also stated this was offensive to them as well. It is a shame, it was our first experience there.  I'm from Cleveland, been in the biz, and been to lots of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants in Chicago. I will not be back at any of them. I felt they treated me rudely and should have just called the health department!",

Their roasted sweet corn, when in season, is a crowd pleaser. Can't come here without have a generous portion of their crab appetizer. Another favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass. They'll blacken for you if you wish. If you're there for lunch, the steak sandwich consists of filet mignon, it's a must. Even the French fries are awesome. I like that the drinks are in generous portions as well as the wine by the glass. I will say that the service here is top notch, from the charming & professional maitre D's, to the server & bus staff. Well trained, knowledgable & attentive. I always get exactly what I ordered & my steaks are cooked to perfection. I don't give 5 stars often but this place has earned it!!",

The waiter was fantastic until about 1/2 way through when he forgot about us totally.  Even the couple next to us got fed up waiting for him and demanded their check from someone else, stood up in the dining room and waited for it, announcing their frustration.  That's the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 because the food was really wonderful.  I had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Chopped Seafood salad with Alaskan King Crab, Lobster and Shrimp.  Really generous seafood on the really yummy salad.  My man had the 16 oz ribeye which was cooked to perfection, he loved it.  The Key Lime Pie, top notch, maybe the best I've ever had outside of Miami.    Disappointment, no mention of happy birthday from our waiter, and no desert or anything special besides the good seating.  Does everyone come to Vegas and say it's their birthday?  Go to Joe's for the food but the service, can't rely on it.  This is the slowest week of the year in Vegas....imagine when it's busy?",

They also give you a basket of different types of bread, which was also nice and tasty. Would definetly recommend.",

But I am writing this review to compliment Joe's bone in steak! Oh my goodness. It was to die for. I was not at all expecting a seafood joint to have such great steak. A must have at Joe's.   Their seared sea bass was also delicious. It was cooked just right so the fish melt in your mouth with just the right amount of flavor.   The service was also great. We were seated in the big dining room the first time we were there for my mom's birthday. The seating area was a bit crowded but tolerable. Our waiter was very attentive. The second time we were there we had about a party of nine and they sat us in the private room without our request, which I thought was very thoughtful of them.   Joe's is a great restaurant for a romantic dinner or to take clients or visiting friends to. This has became one of our favorite restaurants to go to!",

In the 4 years I have been eating here the seafood salad this year was the best one yet, and I have been having this same seafood salad each and every year.  The only downfall however this year was the fresh stone crab claws.  They were fresh-fresh and not fresh frozen, which was why we ordered them, but they were so-so (I would not have them again).  The claws seemed bogged down with water like they were stored in melting ice.  What made up for the so-so crab claws was the service we received from David and being recognized by the Maitre'D, Thomas, when we arrived.  Reservation time was 1:30 pm on Thursday, August 8, 2013.  I look forward to next time I visit LV and will certainly give Joe's another go around!  Oh and by the way, the Key Lime Pie is outstanding!",

We ordered other items such as Roasted Sweet Corn (bomb!), hash browns (can never go wrong w/ potatoes), Lyonnaise (bomb!), four cheese mac & cheese (okay), stone crab (I like seafood, but not a huge fan of this).  I also ordered the shrimp and scallop ceviche because I love ceviches, but I wasn't sure if I should order it because they only taste good by authentic Mexican restaurants.  But because it was a fancy restaurant I went for it.  In the end, I was disappointed...never again.  The shrimp and scallop tasted like shrimp and scallop alright.  It had a hint of lemon on it and lame junk.  They made it worse by serving it with the cheap salt crackers!  What happened to the tostatas?? Fail",

My husband and I always order the 8oz. filet mignon, and the jumbo Alaskan king crab legs... of course with a glass of Moscato. The perfect experience for a beautiful dinner. The restaurant itself is beautiful, a dining area in the front... then towards the back the lights are softly dimmed and more romantic. The music is subtle and charming.

Our guests paid for our meal. I added this restaurant based on what other yelpers had to say about this restaurant, and this place is a pleaser. Make sure you make a reservation. To do this you'll visit the person inside the restaurant who sits in a cubby hole work office outside the host's desk.   Once we arrived our seat was not ready (we didn't wait long 10 minutes), so the host suggested we grab a drink at the bar. The drinks hook you! I had about 4 lemon drop martinis.   The host is awesome...watch him as he greets people as if he's known him for a long time. The host on shift during our visit was an older guy, tall, whitish hair. He's fabulous.   Okay so now the food. Short and sweet-crab bisque (yum) and great presentation. I had scallops wrapped in bacon. Each bunch of 4 scallops were wrapped in bacon-so delicious. My husband had rib eye...and he wasn't disappointed. And, of'course the crabs...these were awesome! We had them as an appetizer, but I suggest ordering a full order (we had never had them so we ordered just an appetizer)...if you like crab at all...order a full order...and I would order the medium size-get more meat. And the mustard sauce is yummy!.   Stop by this place, the food won't disappoint.   Oh yeah-the waiter was great too...even let us take a corny love shot while we were there!",

I knew I just had to try a Stone Crab claw this time no matter what.  We were so stuffed and we definitely fit it in our schedule and came in JUST to try the claws.  We saw that there was an appetizer version with 2 claws and that was what we ordered... one for each of us. I WISH I had room to fit more because it was so yummy.  The mustard sauce that you dip the crab in is SOOOO delish!  I can slather it on everything and eat it.  You also get an awesome bread basket to start off with and unfortunately we couldn't even eat that!  I had a bite of a pretzel bread and I just couldn't eat anymore.  We also ordered blood orange gin fizzes... which were so refreshing and tasty.  I will definitely come back and have a real meal here and not just a crab claw at the bar.",

From the waitstaff in black tie, to the classiness of the decor, everything was 5 star. The crab claws were sweet and flavorful. The filet, lobster and crab cakes were wonderful. The broccolini with garlic was amazing. My wife had the Chilean Sea Bass, which melted on the tongue. And the pies! We had the Cuban and Peanut Butter. Both were fantastic. Get them by the half slice. It is plenty. Really, nothing could have been improved upon. That is not generally easy to say. Need to go back and try all the other amazing items I saw on the menu.",

The flavor was still amazing and that was the only, very small thing that was not perfect. Just to praise Al one more time, he brought us a complimentary piece of the havana dream dessert. It is one of my favorite all time desserts. We could not get enough of it. From making the reservation with Terence to saying goodnight to the staff, our experience was wonderful",

We arrived on time and were promptly greeted and seated in a quiet corner.  Our server, Linda, is English and a delightful person. I started with the crab bisque which was rich and creamy and sprinkled with chunks of crab.  My other partners split a medium order of stone crabs which they loved.  One of my partners also had the lump crab cake which he loved because of the large chunks of crab. For entrees, two of us had the shrimp scampi over linguini while the third person had the fisherman's platter.  He loved it but was disappointed there was no cod.  Linda apologized and explained they had run out of cod so they gave him extra shrimp. Oh, my two partners had a glass of '09 Kungfu Girl Riesling which they enjoyed. To finish, we split a slice of key lime pie which was too tart for me, but they loved. It was a wonderful meal - expensive, but worth it for a special occasion.",

We have been back to this restaurant in Las Vegas every time we are in town.  Dining in the Dining Room and on the patio (OK - not outside, but much cooler in the summer, and you can watch people strolling by) are both fantastic experiences, as the servers are VERY responsive, but we have taken to sitting in the bar.  The bartenders are excellent, we were there Nov 24th for lunch and sat at the bar this time.  The service was immediate, offering menus and drinks.  She was busy, but floated back and forth making drinks, while checking in with those of us sitting at the bar.   We get the same meals.  Crab Louis salad is the perfect size.  A little pricy, but they usually are and this one is loaded with crab.  My husband gets the lunch special of 5 medium claws with slaw (hand mixed at the table), hash browns, and key lime pie.  The mustard sauce is to die for.  The side dishes are too much to eat, as you need to focus on the claws.  We have always had great experiences at Joe's but the friendly, smart service of our bartender, gives this trip 5 stars!",

The prices were a little too much for the amount of crab you get, but the size of the sides made it worth it. I recommend the mac&cheese and the roasted corn were delicious.   The BEST dish I had at this place was the Stone Crab bisque. It is by far the BEST crab bisque I have ever had in my life and probably one of the best soups. I definitely recommend just going there for a bowl of soup and some free bread. It's a great and filling snack.   The atmosphere is boisterous and fun, with a bar in the front room and a nicer eating area in the back. You don't have to dress up for this place, but you can and you won't feel awkward, which makes for a nice balance.   Try it, you'll like it!",

So we expected the same quality at the Vegas location especially considering the fact you are spending at least $100-125 per person for your meal.   This is a very expensive restaurant in Vegas so get ready.  We both had their surf and turf special and the filet was dry and flavorless even though it was medium rare. (and choice not prime) The fish portion was good but small.  The corn special was pretty good as was the bread.  The salad was ok nothing special.   I would not go back as there are many other good steak or seafood places that are not that expensive.",

    "text": "After my first visit to Joe's in Chicago, I was hooked, yet also saddened that there was no Manhattan location.  So, imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw the Las Vegas destination listed on OpenTable.  I made a note of this exciting fact and convinced my friend to try it during our trip to the crazy city.  The lunch hour brought a substantial crowd to the outpost at Casear's Palace, and we had to wait quite a while only to grab two stools at the packed bar.  Our busy and bland waitress/bartender did little to speed up our dining adventure.  We dug through our varied bread basket, each new roll or flat bread an exciting discovery.    We each ordered the Seafood Chopped Salad, the dish that Joe's had won me over with.  The large bowl of mixed greens was topped with slices of hard-boiled egg, cubes of cheese, and various fresh vegetables.  Large succulent shrimp, flavorful lobster claw meat, and chunky Alaskan King Crab were scattered throughout the plate.  The shellfish tasted fresh from the sea, perfectly crisp and tender.  In terms of dressing, I had requested the Joe's Vinaigrette on the side, but was told that it usually comes with the creamy Italian instead.  However, the waitress offered to bring me a cup of each, which I was so thankful for.  The house dressing was more like an oily, garlicky salsa with chunks of ripe tomato.  The Italian vinaigrette was also delicious, with a light-bodied seasoning.  Since the Joe's version contained vegetable pieces, you could basically spice up your salad with drizzles of each.  This fresh meal was what health food dreams are made of, and the bread basket alone is reason enough to dine here.    Joe's is a fantastic chain seafood house that far surpasses expectations.  For all of its touristy, casual dining attributes, it will blow you away with its high-quality ingredients and traditional preparations.",

Definitely make reservations days in advance if you're trying to go on a weekend otherwise if you're lucky, there's first come first serve seating in the patio area (inside the mall but outside of the restaurant). Our waiter was very cordial as they should be for a restaurant of this scale. Get the grilled jumbo prawns on a sugarcane stick!! It's not on the menu, and if you're adventurous or just plain Asian, make sure you ask to keep the heads after they remove it tableside otherwise they'll take it away and if you love sucking crawfish or shrimp heads, you'll know what I'm talkin' about! The large stone crab claws are worth trying but the price tag is hefty.. Too hefty, but that's what you pay for eating on the Strip especially inside the Forum shops. Their dry aged bone in rib eye definitely hit the spot. I asked for medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. Their Chilean sea bass was also a great choice. Very tender! I didn't get to try the branzino but someone at our table ordered it and they were very disappointed. Overall, this is definitely a date night place or special celebration type of place. The bill will add up no matter what you order, especially when you add drinks into the mix.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.  My Hungarian waiter informed me that \"We have no stone crab, but we *may* have some at five.\"  I ordered scallops, only to see a neighboring table be served a pile of stone crab claws.  So thereafter, I called my waiter back over, only to be informed, \"It is now five, and we have them.  We never know before hand.\"  If you have \"stone crab\" in your restaurant's name, I suggest you get on top of the availability of primary menu items.  I felt like a character in the Monty Python cheese shop skit.  My waiter informed me he would comp me for the scallops (which were pretty meh... 15 or more on the plate, too tough, too salty).  When the bill arrived, I was comped instead for a slice of pie (Marie Callander style frozen pie with cardboard crust) and a cup of coffee.  I hope my experience was out of the ordinary, but I paid $80 for dinner for one, and felt like I could have had a better experience for that price at a dozen other places in Vegas.  If you enjoy eating salty scallops, 10 feet from people eating the stone crab claws you were not allowed to order, Joe's is your place.",

    "text": "$$$ is accurate, attire is not super dressy even though the staff is all fancied up ready for work. If you have Perry as your waiter, you are in luck, he'll take care of you.   Appetizers we had: Calamari = Excellent, possibly the best I've had, and the table of four I was with was saying the same. Not soft and chewy, and very easy to eat. If you're stuck on what to get but want *something*, this is a good choice. Crab bisque = first time I had it, and I guess I'm not a fan of it, because my friends thought very highly of it.  Joe's grilled tomato = Excellent, another great choice for an appetizer. Perry said even as a someone not a fan of tomatoes he really likes it. As a fan of tomatoes myself, I also really like it.  Petite 8 oz. filet mignon = I got mine medium, and I should have gotten it medium-rare, I think it would have made it better. They'll give you seasoning you can put on the steak which is quite good. Give it a shot.  Stone crab claws = Friends thought it was good, not great. I didn't think much of it. Very pricey, too, but, it's one of the things they're known for.  Chilean sea bass = Friend said it was excellent. Pretty sure they inhaled it because I barely remember seeing it on the table.  The Sundae (not sure what the real name was -- ice cream on top of a brownie) = Very, very good. High quality dessert that we had to celebrate my wife's birthday.  S'mores pie = Graham cracker crust, chocolate bottom half, roasted marshmallow top-half. This pie was the best pie we've ever had, the chocolate not over-powering or too rich, and the marshmallow does a lot to make this so good. As for me, this was the best part of the meal. It's so good that we're making plans to go to this place again just for the pie, and we were told this is a speciality pie only served in March. A different speciality pie for every month.   We made a reservation for our dinner here and I think that's a good idea, place was pretty packed. Would definitely go here again.",

The crab was not only fresh, but very generous for a salad.   The salad was crisp and very good. The steak was cooked to perfection.  It came with a nut and spice dip.

This is a pretty fancy restaurant, but it was well deserved for both of us!  I ordered the Stone Crabs, Red Wine and my boyfriend and I split the Corn and Mashed Potatoes. My boyfriend ordered the Steak. I LOVED my Crabs. Oh my goodness, so good! Melt in your mouth good to be exact! The Corn was equally as good, where as the Mashed Potatoes fell below par. My Wine was great too. My boyfriend said his Steak wasn't as good as he hoped, considering how much he paid for it.   The staff where wonderful and helpful. They made me feel comfortable as I made a mess while eating my Crab! Thanks for that Joe's Staff!!   Overall, I loved this place!

Also I am a total crab fiend so it's a winner for me. My husband ordered the filet mignon and it was really delicious - it ended up being so much meat that he couldn't even eat his side (which is his ideal predicament lol) and I too was too full of crab to eat my side so we got them to go and munched on them in the hotel while we watched something on tv because we were too fat to move. Also the servers are so well trained in allergy awareness that i was able to order exactly what I wanted and be totally confident that neither of us would end up sick. I told them I appreciated that and our server explained to us that the restaurant takes it so seriously that they even have daily paperwork which needs to be signed off otherwise they get written up - talk about accountability. Food allergy sufferers rejoice, you are in safe hands here",

I had been here before but it had been quite awhile so it was almost like it was my first visit again.  I had a grapefruit margarita that was excellent (it even was garnished with a big slice of fresh grapefruit).  Their bread basket contained pretzel bread which is one of my favorite breads ever so our meal was already off to a great start.  I had the filet which was cooked perfectly and my wife had a fish special of the day and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  My kids were very happy with their mac and cheese and sliders.  I know Joe's is more known for their key lime pie (which is great) but you need to have the peanut butter pie as it is life changing haha.  The service was awesome and our waiter was super friendly.  I would definitely come back to Joe's again.    Oh and beware of the baked sweet potato as it comes out looking like a woman's body part ;) my wife had to take awhile to stop laughing before she could eat it haha.",

I asked her which one of the eight sides was a must try..,she replied \" to many to choose from\"....OKAYYYY... I said what about Mac and cheese she replied with a bland face \"it's creamy\" I don't know if that's a good thing or not....

I rarely ever order crab on a menu because it is usually disappointing. Too salty and too stringy.  The king crab, however, was absolutely fantastic!  My husband and I followed the king crab as an appetizer with the wedge salad followed by our shared main entrees of the best fried chicken in the world and also the scallops. Our veggie side were the crispy brussels sprouts!  Based on recommendations on Yelp, we ordered the banana cream pie which was the most tantalizing combination of perfectly ripe bananas, cream, warm caramel sauce. The coffee is also something exceptional!  After you're finished eating, they bring you warm towels to wipe your hands with fresh lemons over the washcloths. It's the perfect duo of a fresh, real washcloth wipe with the natural lemon scent!  Many thanks to our server Steve G. for an overall 5+ star experience!",

We had a party of 6 and were easily able to make a reservation for Friday night. Out reservation was for 7:30 and we were seated on time by the hostess. (Super plus in my book!)   The decor of the restaurant is very classy and upscale. The mood is lounge-like due to ambient lighting and Dark-wood furniture. Our waiter was very nice and he reviewed all the specials, provided the wine list, bread, and informed us of crab selection (which Joe's is known for.) He was helpful in answering our questions about specific menu items and promptly took our order.  I personally had the crabcakes and the Joe's coleslaw. Both were amazing!!! The crabcakes had a nice big chunks of crab and it tasted super fresh! The coleslaw had vinegar base but it's still had a sweetness to it and then they added tomato which changed up the taste that it was still great! I also had a glass of Moscato which was smooth and sweet and very light just as I asked. (Additional notes on the food.... The sides typically come family-style, the grilled shrimp are huge, and the steak is especially tender!)   Over all the experience was great. This is definitely a fine dining restaurant so have your wallet handy. Other than that.... enjoy because the food is quite tasty!!!",

Nothing was as fantastic as the crab stuffed shrimp!  We did have an issue during our visit. Our waiter made me a little uncomfortable with his familiarity. I put this aside and enjoyed my dinner, it didn't end up mattering since we never saw him again. Someone else brought our food and refilled our water. We felt ignored even when we tried to get his attention. He was obviously very attentive to his other tables. We assumed maybe they'd added our table to his section and he wasn't used to it? The longer we waited after finishing our meals, the more we realized his tables were prioritized based on ticket price. My mother daughter trip didn't involve drinking, this shouldn't reduce our level of service.  We didn't let it ruin a delicious meal, however, this is Vegas, delicious food is everywhere. I will choose a place with service to match the food next time.",

They give you a Mustard/Mayo Dipping sauce which my Mom said was incredible but I dont like Mayo.   So they gave me a Malt Vinegar and their Red Wine Shallot vinigerette to dip the crabs in,  Both were sooo good!  We started with salads. I had the Chopped Veggie Salad which had a ton of veggies and was great. My parents had a Chopped Lettuce Tomato and Blue Cheese Salad which they loved.  My Dad did not get the Stone Crabs, he got Lobster Tail  Tempura. I tasted it, and it was also Melt in Your Mouth.  Sides we got: Lyonaisse Potatoes (I dont eat potatoes but they looked amazing if you do). They were  dome shape, crunchy, and had carmelized onions on top. Brocollini, which was simple with a garlic and olive oil, but very good.  They give you a good selection of breads beforehand that seem to be homemade.   I'm not really one to eat bread before a meal, but they had these really think cracker like things with parm cheese baked in and some intersesting seeds that we couldnt get enough of.  Parents split the Key Lime Pie for dessert.   I didnt eat it, but it looked good, they said it was very good and the homemade crust looked good.  Waiter was great.  Very informative and nice.  I'd 100% recommend. One of those places that, yes its pricey, but the food makes it totally worth the money.",

The seafood is as fresh and tasty as if they were cooked right from the net/cages they were caught in. Secondly, their customer service is outright stupendous. I booked the private room for a party of 8 and all our food came out perfect except for myself, which unfortunately was over cooked & then came back way under cooked. While everyone elses food was good and almost finished they apologized to me serveral times when I wasn't too mad anyways. They comp'ed the whole $600 meal, when I didn't even imply for it to get to that, without flinching. We were all floored and left a $200 tip anyways. I've been back a couple times afterwards and loved my steaks/seafood. Zero hesitation to go back.",

He's the best in the joint. This place is 'The Bomb\". You're going to love it!",

The mashed potatoes are so good, and the stone crab app with the mustard sauce, yum yum yum.  The only reason I am knocking off one star is because our server really rushed us.  She was super-efficient at her job which is great but this isn't a diner so she really needed to slow her roll.  She tried several times to take away plates before we were finished and also kept coming back for the check when we hadn't even looked at it yet.  If it was a little more leisurely, I'd give them 5 stars.  I would definitely come there again, though, and would recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "This was definitely the highlight of Vegas. It was Monday night and wasn't sure what we wanted to eat so after doing some Yelp searching, the hubby decided to go to Joe's. The hubby have been to the one in Miami and raved about the stone crab and the key lime for over a year now and knew this is the time for me to try it. Once you sit down, a basket of variety of bread comes to the table, even though it is not the warm kind, it is still tasty. I started out with a cup of stone crab bisque which is nothing too special. It tasted like the crab and asparagus soup my hubby made. Then we ate an order of the 7 medium stone crab and each bite was so deccadent. My main entree was the Fisherman's Platter which consist of prawns, scallop, calamari, and fish; you have a choice for fried or broiled and because I am on a healthy kick, I opted for the broiled. My hubby order the bone-in rib eye and he claims it is the best steak he had. It was cooked just right (medium well). I had a couple of bites, and the meat was so tender and it melted in my mouth just right with all its own juices (salavating while writing this). At the end, of course, we had to have the key lime pie and according to the hubby, it was the saem goodness back in Miami. Our tummies were definitely fulfilled and what a great way to end our Vegas trip. This is definitely a place to go for a special occassion while in Vegas or if you have some money to spend because it is not cheap. I didn't get it five stars because the service wasn't Great, it was just good.",

Everything tasted so refreshingly cold, fresh and succulent.  We were going to walk someplace else for dessert, but then our waiter gave us the key lime pie. Boy am I glad he did. This was THE BEST key lime pie I have ever eaten! Even better than the one we ate in Florida!! Not to be missed if you love key lime pie. Nice thick slice, served super cold - very tangy!  I also have to note that they give you a bread basket with assorted breads - the corn bread is amazing. So moist and the perfect amount of sweetness with fresh corn embedded throughout. I would like an entire basket of corn bread please.   Service: 5 Star all around, especially with the free pie!!  Location: if you are in Caesar's casino, you have to walk all the way to the end of the Forum Shops, then take the escalator down.   Seating: there is seating in the mall area, in the bar area, and all the way in the back of the restaurant there is more seating.",

Ordered 2 Bone in Ribeye steaks Medium and ordered a $20 glass of red wine. Told the server we wanted the wine when the steaks came out.   The steaks arrived and our wines were not served with it. I reminded the server that we ordered wine and it look 7min for her to get us our glasses... by then the steak started to cool down.   Then steaks came and it was medium rare and rare in the center. I don't mind a rare steak but for being a famous high end steak spot you would think they know how to cook a proper medium steak. I sent it back and they recooked it for us. We had to wait for it of course and in the mean time our side dishes became cold. The manager came by and apologized but that was it.  Not looking for freebies but the bill was $150 each and the service was slow and food wasn't cooked per ordered. I don't know if the lunch staff just doesn't care as much as the dinner staff or they were being trained but was not impressed",

(The corn muffins in the breadbasket are dangerous and will fill you up, so don't go overboard)  The steaks? An expensive afterthought.  I've had a better steak at Texas Roadhouse... real talk. Luckily, I didn't order one here, but my date did. It was beautiful and the seasoning was impeccable, but the meat was muscle-like, tough--even with a medium well sear.   Thank God for the seafood platter--which contained three of the best lobster tails I've ever eaten. Honestly, I didn't care for the stone crab claws, I understand why they aren't served warm, but they were extremely watery and kinda bland. Some steam heat and a little garlic butter would've taken the to another level.   I totally understand the attraction to this place-- reservations are necessary on the weekends and stick with the seafood--- crab cake, legs, lobster tails --you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I love this place! This is one of my top favorite Seafood restaurants of all times. It is difficult to make a reservation, because they are so popular. I highly recommend making reservation in advance (especially if you have a large party).   The Restaurant:  This elegant and cute restaurant is located at the Ceasar's forum shops. The place is big and pretty. It has an elegant yet traditional style. There are three areas: Bar, outdoor (but inside the mall) patio, and the dining section. The restaurant is roomy and has tables or booths depending on people's preference.       The Food and Drinks:  Food here and the first thing that comes to my mind is their delicious world famous \"Stone Crabs,\" best thing you would ever taste in your life! You can get is as an appetizer or as an entree. I normally get them as an appetizer and I share with the table. They are pricey but worth it.  The menu has a variety of seafood and bone-in steaks. I've had their \"Chilean Sea Bass,\" cooked with miso sauce -Very flavorful and nice fish portion. This is what I always get when I come here. But my husband had had the \"Lobster Tail,\" and the \"Alaskan King Crab\" and I had a bite of those and they were amazing!  During my last visit my party of 3 and I shared the stone crab and some oysters. The oysters have a dipping sauce made with champagne and it just makes the flavor of the oysters to pop! We had the \"Kumamoto oysters\" as a recommendation from the server. There are different sides that you can share with your table, but I think they run a little small. I've had their \"Four Cheese Mac & Cheese\" - Amazing and full of cheese! Love it.  \"Jennie's Mashed Potatoes\" -Delicious mashed potatoes with thick and crispy parmesan cheese on top! They were amazing!  \"Hashed Brown\" -Great side, a little different to have hash browns for dinner but they were really good! Dessert is always my favorite part of the meal, I just love sweets! This restaurant has the Best \"Key Lime Pie\" they are known for it and they have earn that right. Great pie, wonderful flavor! The crust is delicious and thick. I love it!  I've also had tasted the \"Banana Cream Pie\" -is a good dessert, it felt too rich to me but that's just my opinion.  Cocktails: In my last visit, I had the \"Hemingway Daiquiri\" - it tasted amazing! It was the right amount of sweet and a little bit of spices.   The rest of my party had a \"Blood Orange Paloma\" of course I had to try it and it was good!    The Service:  Service is amazing! The staff completes the whole dining experience. Bryan, the last server I had, was amazing! He took amazing care of our table. He brought us warm towels with lemon drop so we could clean our hands after eating the crab and then again after the dinner was over. He is a great guy. You can tell all the staff here is highly experienced and well trained. We had a couple more guys bringing us waters and other removing the plates and cleaning the croutons from the table. I made a reservation for 8:30 and when we arrive the place was packed, so I thought we had to wait to get seated but no, they respected the reservation and by 8:30 sharp we were walking to our table. I love that!",

The we ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, all filler, only found one oyster. Next the soups, Manhattan Clam Chowder and crab bisque, both excellent. For our entree my wife had the Crab Louie, I had the halibut.  Both were good, not great, just okay.  Our side dish was the hash brown potatoes; very good - too much for two people. For dessert we ordered the key lime pie - it should have been advertised as the key lime popsicle.  It was so cold, it hurt my wife's teeth. Our server was pretentious, and somewhat rude - but we muddled through.",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent Vegas a lot, and I mean A LOT. Last week, we were joined by our friends from Michigan and we wanted to take them to a nice place for a great steak. We actually had never been to Joe's before but risked it due to the rave reviews and availability for reservations. This was extremely worth the risk because we have found our new favorite steakhouse on the strip. From the minute we walked up to be seated down to the last bite of dessert, everything was wonderful. Our server, John Smart was INCREDIBLE. He was super informative about the menu, he checked in regularly to see what we needed, and he even went above what I have ever seen in service at a restaurant despite being to many top notch places on the strip. My husband started to not feel well once we sat down for dinner so we had to cancel his order sadly since he didn't feel like he could eat. John was super accommodating, said it was no problem at all, then proceeded to bring him seltzer water with bitters to help settle his stomach. That was so above and beyond of him, especially after just canceling his order. Our food was wonderful: calamari with tasty tartar sauce, steaks cooked perfectly as ordered, they even asked and took the tail from my lobster table side, and the sweet corn side dish was simply delicious. John even honored our coupon for free pie for both parties and those were so yummy. They even have Boston Cream Pie which is rare to find so I was all over that, but the Key Lime is what they are known for and I can see why. John even brought each of us couples bread baskets to go and we were so excited to have those because the corn bread was SO GOOD on top of the other awesome choices. Overall, one of the best experiences not just because of the good food, but the cutting edge service from John will keep us returning for all Vegas trips in the future when we want a nice steak dinner. Highly recommend Joe's!",

Gabriel was our amazing Mater Dei who was able to accommodate us for late night reservations (9:30pm). The theme continued with our amazing server, Danny, who was a wealth of knowledge with both the food & wine menu. We ended up choosing Oysters Rockefeller + Manhattan Chowder + Filets + Cote's du Rhone red wine = Wonderful dinner! Danny went on to assist us in S'mores Pie for dessert, what a delight! Overall, we sampled a small portion of Joe's amazing menu and look forward to coming back when we're in town again to experience the remainder. The food and staff made the experience well worth while! I HIGHLY recommend!",

I've only eaten one thing here I didn't like (the Manhattan chowder was too salty), but the pure seafood dishes (stone crab, etc) are exquisitely presented, fresh, and just make you feel like a million bucks when you order them.  I always sit at the bar when I go to Joe's, and when the restaurant isn't too busy the bar is very comfortable with a nice dark glow to it-- classic but not stuffy. The only issue I have had at the bar is that Joe's attracts a lot of older partiers (convention men and women, etc) who seem to have no sense of space, so I've had women literally spinning my seat around and leaning on me while trying to hug people and men reaching over me rudely, all while I'm trying to enjoy my $50 crab legs. Would be nice if they could lay the space out a bit better, or have a separate bar that's just for drinks or something, so the bar diners don't have to get mauled by the people waiting for dining room tables.",

We arrived and had to wait mean while we had reservations and they were told it was a special occasion ahead of time. 12/15/18.   GET OFF YOUR HIGH Your management team needs a class on customer service your food isn't that good and people pay good money, treat them kindly and with a little respect. This not the soup Nazi or is it ?  We were showed to our table  Which was a table in the middle of a walkway. We didnt see this table last time we ate here.  Everyone in our party was actually shocked and offended it was even offered. I was in a wedding dress and clearly with a wedding party. I also eat here every time I come from LA to visit.  We had to eat in the bar area. The soup came out cold. The salad seemed off. The steaks were just ok slightly over done, the 1.5 pound king crab legs were pretty good. The apps were mediocre. The stuffed shrimp was pretty good. We didn't get deserts nor did they offer us any.   We had bought gift cards and had purchased them online. They wouldn't allow us to use the gift cards till 2019 but there was no clear indication of that online and we were able to prove that.   We called a manager over and he offered us nothing, embarrassed us and him self. Rather than taking 20 bucks off and giving us a desert after treating us poorly he was acting like we should have been honored to spend our money there. I'm sure they are all nice people who made bad decisions. The food normally is not disappointing and half the food was pretty good. Just sucks you ruined my wedding and embarrassed us. Some days being a good loyal customer doesn't get you anything. At mastros they treat is well and at Del Frisco we are actually there number 1 customer we eat there 2 times a week. A little kindness guys and a little less snobbery. We frequently go to Stella and we are a rewards member they are always very kind. It wasn't my pleasure to eat here on my wedding night.",

We started off with a nice Pinot and Crab Claws. The crab claws were extremely fresh and the meat was sweet. Although, I feel the taste did not commensurate the cost. Perhaps, I'm just not a big fan of crab claws. Next time I will opt for the king crab legs. My husband had the prime filet and I had the bone-in filet. Both were cooked perfectly medium rare and had a nice sear on them. They were exquisite! We concluded the wonderful meal with my husband's favorite dessert: cheesecake.

The flavor and tenderness of the dry aged is worth the extra splurge.  I know this place is called stone crab, but the king crab legs are by far superior and they are well worth it.  Best crab legs in town and the meat is so much more flavorful in comparison to the stone crab. Brussel Sprouts are crispy, flavorful heaven. Salads are so fresh and delicious. Hash browned potatoes are mehhhh.  Service is always outstanding here.  Do yourself a favor and make a reservation for this place the next time you're in Vegas!  It is our favorite place to celebrate special occasions when we are in town!  Plus, they have menu items for all budgets.  You can get something delicious for $15-20/person or you can easily spend $100-150/person.  Our bill for two generally ends up being between $100-200.",

    "text": "First of all, the food was Great!, This has to do with Service, and it really only applies to Groups.  but....we went on a Friday night with a group of 13 for a surprise 40th birthday. We got the private back room which was great, and the waitress was ok. The problem started after our meal. The waitress brought out a bill for 13 people, we all sat next to our significant other and thought she had been paying attention to the orders but the bill came and she refused to separate it. To make it even worse we were only then informed that they can only take 3 credit cards and the rest had to be cash. We were all from Canada and don't carry that much cash as we spent around 125$ each.  We asked to speak to the Manager as there were 6 couples and 1 single that needed to pay and most needed cards. They wouldn't accept this and said there was nothing they could do about separating the bills. After 20 minutes of arguing with management one of our group members divided the bill into each member's total for their incompetent staff. We then had to figure out how to pay. After dealing with this absurd rule we eventually just told management we can only pay with credit for the most part and each group was separated. After sensing the frustration they reluctantly allowed more than 3 people to pay with credit.  When paying the waitress said to one of our group members, \"you university students must not eat at restaurants like this much\" and that \"you just don't know how its done\". First of all, after refusing to separate bills a waitress is not likely a mathematician and the room had multiple doctors and university lecturers. No students.  It is usually customary to inform the guests that there is an automatic 20% gratuity with groups, We realized this after closely examining our bills but she was sure fishing for an extra tip. I am always happy to pay for good service, but this was an absolute nightmare.   So needless to say all our other meals at \"nice\" restaurants started off with asking the wait staff, can we get separate bills and can we each pay with credit cards? To which the staff looked dumbfounded and replied: \"yes of course, why?\"  For a much better experience go to Toa or anywhere else.  I have made sure to tell everyone I know going to Vegas to avoid Joe's. I'm sure it would be great for couples, but a group of any size should avoid it at all costs.  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.ca%2FShowUserReviews-g45963-d583694-r541007166-Joe_s_Seafood_Prime_Steak_Stone_Crab-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html&s=7f41fa4354467465ba7dabdb377d4fe5466cb80c20e3b98ba9ac332c4985e366\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR...</a>",

I order the 16oz rib eye, the steak seamed way smaller than 16oz and it was over cooked  this steak was on par with a Outback steak that you will be paying half the price.  Service was great but I expected more for $56 steak.",

We both shared the sides which were creamed spinach, Mac and cheese, and jennys potatoes. My man had the chicken for his entree and stole some of my steak since it was his birthday, that was ok. For dessert I had the cheesecake and they gave him a complimentary brownie sundae with a candle which I thought was sweet.",

Nice bottle of Cakebread to start then came the shrimp cocktail, I swear they were 6ft long! Jk, but they were huge and served with a lovely horseradish infused cocktail sauce to dip in.  Next came the scallops and my oh my they are off the charts! Don't miss these gems, they are small but full of flavor.  I almost cried when they were gone. The Caesar salad was delish and next came the Alaskan King Crab Legs!  There was no Krusty Krab here! (SpongeBoB) 1 HUGE leg of the sweetest most tender crab, cracked open table side, and ready for a plunge into the drawn butter.   Service was superb ask for Darrell; very attentive, kind, and never let our wine or water get low!

    "text": "I picked this restaurant specifically for two reasons. One is because I felt this would be a \"people pleaser\" in terms of a solid steakhouse for a larger group. The other because it was a three dollar sign joint. I realize steakhouses can get pricey, so I wanted to find something that wasn't going to break the bank, but still be \"fine dinning.\"   The service is very good, I'll note right away. But please be wary, our server was a totally up-seller. She knew exactly what she was doing.... \"oh, if you're going to get a couple glasses of wine, get a bottle\" or \"what appetizers can I start you with\" almost as soon as we sat down. I kinda feel like they're probably all trained that way. Not necessarily annoying, but be wary!  Also, the food is all a la carte. So you'll get up there in price with what you order. We had a table of 8 and ordered 4 different sides and they were all gone by the end of dinner. But it was the perfect amount. The good: garlic roasted spinach, the lyonnaise, and my fave grilled tomatoes (wonderfully red tomatoes with pesto and melted mozzarella on top aka YUM!). The okay: broccolini.   I ordered a special, which was Filet Mignon with crab on top. I really wanted both the filet and crab, and the regular menu listed large pieces of both for much more. This was the perfect amount for $36. Plus asparagus! It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very flavorful. The crab was fantastic and I almost wished there was more. Maybe a bit more, but the portion was good still.   Best part is they brought the birthday boy, my dad, a free brownie sundae! All in all, a really excellent meal. Ended up being perfect for what I was looking for!",

    "text": "We had our trip planned to Las Vegas and all we needed was a good steak house to celebrate my wife's birthday.  I took to Yelp and started my research.  Joe's was one of the first restaurants that come up on my search.  With over 2,000 reviews and having a 4.5 star rating we decided to make reservations and give it a shot.  It's conveniently located within the Caesar's mall area and is very easy to find.  Once inside you don't even know you are in a mall.   The ambience reminded me of an old school steak house, dimly lit, dark wood decor and white table cloths.  One of the main reasons we chose this place was because of the Stone Crab.  We are big fans of crab but have never tried the Stone Crab.  We had the Stone Crab as an appetizer which was perfect.  They come in small, medium and large.  Your server will recommend the large because they are easier to handle but they are the most costly.  Speaking of cost you shouldn't go hear looking for moderate price tag.  It's a bit pricey (as is any decent steak house) but that's ok because the food is very high quality.  After the Stone Crab we were each served our main course.  My wife ordered a Petite Filet and I went with the Rib Eye (No bone).  We were both very pleased with our steaks from the flavor to how it was prepared to our liking.  I order all my steaks medium rare and my wife orders hers medium.  Both were perfect.  I had a baked potato and my wife had a sweet potato as a side.  Can't really mess those up and they didn't.  The only problem with our meal was the fact that we each could not finish our steaks.  We may have over indulged in the bread basket beforehand.  That's what happens when you starve yourself because you know you are going to have a great dinner.  The bread basket hit the table and like magic it disappeared.  Our service was pretty good although we kind of got the feeling our server was disappointed we didn't order a bottle of wine over just two glasses.  I could be completely wrong but that's the vibe we got.  Overall though I would not hesitate to come back to Joe's and probably will every time we come back to Vegas.",

And the horseradish mustard the crab is served with is absolutely perfect. I've never had crab with mustard before and it's a terrific idea.   The service was also exceptional which was surprising because this is a tourist joint. I mean, it's right next to the fountains in Caesars Palace. A millions thanks to Neil & Eric for making our night. We were here for my sissy's whirlwind bachelorette party and we only had time for one nice restaurant so I'm relieved Joe's exceeded expectations.   My only word of advice: don't get the steak. Trust me. I would complain about how dry my steak was if I wasn't so enamored with the stone crab.   Oh, actually, I have one more piece of advice: Get the mac n' cheese. It's probably the best mac n' cheese I've ever had. Perfect balance of cheeses and the gooeyness is stunning. I'm dying for the recipe!",

Since I was in town for my birthday, I specifically choose to dine here instead of my local Joe's...and it was everything I thought it would be. I ordered the Grilled seafood platter and everything was cooked to perfection. I would come to this establishment again! Not for the staff but for the food.  I'm keeping this review short & sweet!",

    "text": "One of the best meals I've had recently...  We showed up just at 10 o'clock, which is closing time, but were seated with no problem. Linda, our server, was warm and friendly and well informed about all the menu choices and steered us to some good options including the fresh roasted corn special  (side dish) which was delicious.  The New York strip was expertly prepared and had great flavor. The hamburger was terrific and the hamburger patty melted in your mouth. The stone crab was tasty, but we only got a few claws as an appetizer (better with cocktail sauce in my opinion than with the mustard-based sauce that comes with it).  I wish they had a little deeper selection of craft beers to choose from, but aside from that it was a perfect meal and we will go back... Joe's seems different to me than the typical Las Vegas \"flashy\" restaurant. They seem to actually care about your experience and food whereas a lot of the other restaurants in Vegas know they're only going to see you once and don't make much of an effort.   A straightforward menu, expertly prepared without a lot of nonsense... Perfect meal!",

We ordered a large, which was about $70, and it came with about 5-6 claws. The flavor was definitely great, but maybe I'm too used to eating crab claws at buffets in Vegas, so I was left hungry haha!   He got the sea bass, which was probably the biggest sea bass we've ever been served. He definitely enjoyed it!  But the Brussels sprouts... SO GOOD. Perfectly crispy. If you're a fan of Brussels sprouts, don't skip over these.  Overall, really good experience. The staff here is really friendly and helpful as well, which always enhances the experience. Would come back to try the whale, and the filet and tail!",

    "text": "Joe's is pretty much at the top of the list when I'm looking for a restaurant that has both quality steaks and seafood. I've never had a bad experience. The food has always been delicious and there's nothing that I've ordered that has been bad. Service has always been outstanding.  I came here on a Thursday afternoon for a lunch date with my mother. We walked up to the host stand and were seated  immediately in the \"patio\" area. Jon was our server and I do not have enough positive superlatives to describe his service. He was friendly, helpful, efficient, and funny. Without a doubt, five stars.  Make sure you take a good look at the market card that the server hands you at greeting. It has the market prices for oysters and stone crabs plus any seasonal entrees and sides that are available. We both ordered from the card with my mom receiving a generous, nicely cooked portion of Alaskan halibut ($28.95) and a side of white asparagus ($9.95) which my mother consumed so fast that I did not even get a taste. I started with 6 stellar bay oysters ($16.95) followed by the classic two course lunch ($34.95) which consisted of 5 medium stone crab claws, hash brown potatoes, cole slaw which was mixed table side by Jon, and key lime pie for dessert. The two course lunch is a steal in my book.  I've been here for dinner also and their steaks are just as satisfying as the seafood. Yes, it's pricey, but well worth it to pay extra for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert.",

I Had never been to this restaurant before, was a referral from a friend of mine, so we went. I let him order since I had no idea what to get :)  He ordered the Stone Crab and some Crab Legs. I was very happy with them all. As you guys can tell from some of my previous reviews, I am sure somewhere in there I have gone to AYCE buffets that have crab legs, and I will say I have honestly never had \"premium\" crab legs, and there is a difference.   I also had the Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon, that was excellent.  The stone crab got me going though. The taste was superb. I never had them before, and was really impress...to the point that I just placed my first order for Stone Crab yesterday since it is now Stone Crab season.  The Crab Legs were great as well. The meat was so thick I go full off maybe 2 or 3 of them. Usually at the buffet I will have many many plates of crab legs, but for some reason I was stuffed off only a few of these, the Stone Crabs and my ahi tuna steak.  Overall, paired with some good wine and people, this location got me. I don't know what the bill was, I am sure it was a pretty penny with a few bottles of wine flowing, but I am sure it was up there.  One thing is to know about Stone Crabs, if you don't is that seasons is from October 15th to May 15, so me eating here in September, I must have had frozen stock or they pulled the stone crab legs from another vendor, not sure. It was good either way.",

The decor is reminiscent of a refined private club, although it is not at all stuffy. There are televisions in the bar, but they are neither loud nor intrusive. Several time we have enjoyed the same bartender, who is just the right combination of friendly and professional.  I can see that dinner might be pricey, but lunch is reasonable, likely because we usually order two appetizers each, or a sandwich and an appetizer. My favourite is the \"Second Mortgage\", which includes stone crab, jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail and shrimp and scallop ceviche served cracked on ice. It was approximately sixteen dollars on our last trip.   As I have allergies and cannot eat the ceviche, they always put on the side for my dining companion. Allergy alert: I always explain it in detail, and they always get it right. Recognizing that we might share, when his food comes out,  they point out what I cannot have from his plate, unsolicited. Those of you with allergies will recognize these as two signs of a good restaurant. They will provide you with a lovely bread basket on request.   Do order a gin-and-tonic, as they use a premium tonic (Stirrings), and it does make a difference.  Certainly one of our favourite places in Vegas, and we highly recommend it.",

We sent it back. 10 minutes later he had a platter of cold king crab sent to the table to make up for the problem.  If you go ask if the crab is in season, if not, get the king crab. Their steaks are great, the sides very large & good, and probably has the best fried chicken on the west coast.  Key lime pie is a must. Try it, it is one of the top restaurants in Vegas.",

For sides I had read about the roasted sweet corn (it deserved all the hype) and the steamed asparagus.  We ALWAYS get the coleslaw - it is the best coleslaw around, prepared table side.  The coleslaw has two big slices of tomato and is light and flavorful.  This time we skipped desert - to full.  I would recommend all the deserts especially the Key Lime Pie.",

Two thumbs up for this since when we visited (week of July 9th) the temps were 115-116 during the day cooling down to 95-100 in the evenings!  The drinks are pricey... $15 for a cranberry & Grey Goose... but they're stiff!!!  The food is rather reasonably priced for a rather high end seafood/steak restaurant in Las Vegas.    I had the stone crab appetizer, my husband had the Joe's Cole Slaw, we split the 12oz filet and the Big Daddy's Potatoes (not on the menu so I'll describe... they're hashed browns sitting on a bed of caramelized onions then topped with loaded baked potato innards... must must must try!!!).  For dessert I had the Havana Dream Pie (white cake with a custard filling and an uber-thick drizzle of dulce de leche on top... again, a must must must try!!!)  and hubby had the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge.   Our food total was under $90 which is not expensive for the quantity and quality of food.  It was my birthday so they brought out a complimentary brick of flourless chocolate cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is then topped with hot fudge.  This was very tasty however since we had each ordered a dessert it was totally too much / OTT and we would have preferred they either comp the dessert I ordered or told me they'd be bringing that out so I would not have ordered something else.     Service was excellent... from the bar tender to the waitress to the maitre d.  No complaints whatsoever and we'll certainly be back!",

Don't get me wrong, they were pretty good, but really nothing special. Just scallops. Literally-- just. scallops. My mom enjoyed her stonecrab, but the steaks my dad and boyfriend ordered were both WAY undercooked. They ordered medium rare, and got steaks that were pretty much bleeding.   None of the entrees come with side dishes, so you order those and share. We found them all to be just okay.  It was a fine meal, but I'm not in any hurry to go back.",

Crab cake: excellent Drinks: not memorable. Caesar salad: good  12oz filet: ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. The meat was poor quality, with significant connective tissue in it, and the cook botched medium rare completely -- 2/3 completely raw core, and a burnt crust on the outside. Neither of us wanted to eat it. We sent it back and they took it off the bill, but there's NO excuse for a bad steak at a \"Prime Steak\" place. Fail. Automatic one star.  I would have fled the restaurant (after paying) at this point but fantastic hubby wanted the excellent key lime pie. I was so repulsed by the steak that I didn't even want my usual after-dinner coffee... I just wanted to get out of there.  I will say that the highlight of the dinner for me, besides the crab cake, was our waiter, who was attentive and helpful.  This was our anniversary dinner. We've decided on a redo somewhere else.",

Squeezing a lemon wedge on them saved them from nothingness. They came with a mustard sauce which obliterated the crab's lack of taste. Unlike this taste violation, their baked tomatoes with spinach puree and cheddar is a wonder to behold, and worth the long walk from the Excalibur. Even their tea was terrible. The service was surly and getting a towel to save my fingers from terminal crabbiness took some doing. I had walked by this restaurant a couple of years ago and thought they must do something wonderful with crabs to name their restaurant Joes Stone Crabs.. Maybe in Miami. Here it is all sauce, and sauceless crabs are tasteless crabs, and a waste of their lives and my dollars. Avoid the universe this restaurant is in.",

Had a Chardonnay and a Riesling that were fine. Service was spotty, appetizer plates and some cutlery were cleared and not replaced. Had to ask for a knife and fork again. Took a while to locate our server and get the bill to show up. All in all we left severely underwhelmed. $200 lunch for two should at least have the main proteins cooked to an edible state.",

The fact that it was still mobbed at that hour was instantly a good sign.  I opted to sit at the dark and richly appointed bar to avoid the 20 minute wait for a table, and got to work on ordering and eating.  The crab and artichoke gratin was rich and delicious, served with buttered toast rounds.  The lump crab cakes were more crab than cake, seasoned well and portioned generously.  Garlic spinach and mac'n'cheese rounded out the meal, and both were done in the style of the steakhouses of old.  This entire meal was served up, along with some good conversation, by Mark the bartender.  He must've been the hardest working man in Vegas that night, as he spent the duration of our meal pouring drinks of various descriptions for the patrons, serving up dinner to those at the bar, and keeping us entertained by chatting about books and travel.  Overall, we walked out of this wonderful place full and after paying less than what we would expect.  I cannot recommend Joe's enough for a nice, classy meal in a wonderful atmosphere.

Service was prompt and friendly, as usual. Bread basket is delivered to the table before any food orders are placed.  We each ordered shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. It was very good. The cocktail sauce has a dollop of horseradish which gives it more than the usual kick. My wife had the Copper River Sockeye Salmon special. Salmon was cooked as she requested and she rated the dish as excellent.   My favorite dish has always been the Parmesan Crusted Halibut with lemon butter sauce. The dish has been changed on the menu but our server told me he could have the halibut prepared as it was previously. The dish was as I remembered and was also excellent. We will continue to make this a must stop on our next trip in October.",

    "text": "Woohoo! As good as it gets! 5/5 EXCELLENT!  STOP! Beware the next comment may cause the reader to salivate  is exactly how I felt as I bit into my absolutely sinfully delectable and succulent Chilean Sea Bass with Miso ...(*mouth starts salivating).. glaze..   It's white mass was cooked to perfection. Presented center stage next to a neatly dressed soy-teriyaki bok choy reduction on a decadent flawless white serving plate, it is visually stunning.  The Miso glaze crust was flaky and crispy (almost lightly fried), but as you bit into the actual sea creature's flesh it starts to part into two as your teeth bite into it. The steamy, juicy flesh meat rushes to your taste buds and you totally fall in love it. It is soft, the texture akin'd to a firmer softened butter with a clean taste absent of any overpowering fishiness inexperienced restaurants suffer from. Oh no, this fish was absolutely PERFECT! This experience, which I've only had once, was only at this Joe's Seafood Restaurant!  If I had a final meal on this planet, It'd be the entire menu at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab Restaurant! Bar none!  You cannot go wrong with anything you order here, but DO NOT FORGET TO TRY THE SEABASS if you're a fish eater!  As expected for a restaurant of such reputation, the decor and staff is without a doubt FLAWLESS! Expect to tip the Matrie D' to take you seriously and receive a seat... otherwise wait for an obscene amount of time watching other people eat. They only take reservations for 8 or more.  PROS: EVERYTHING  CONS: Becareful, as this place is very expensive. The Chilean Sea Bass with Miso Glaze will go for $38.95 a'la carte!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!",

    "text": "We went here before our flight back home after a wedding in Vegas.  After all the great food (Four Seasons room service and catering, Sonic) I wasn't sure what we were going to do.  The Girl had to make a return to the James Perse store so we made our trek after checkout (amen for having a rental car this time) to the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  It was insanely crowded being Saturday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend so we had to park pretty far.  We had about 2 hours to find something to eat so after much deliberation we decided on Joe's Seafood because it was near James Perse.  The wait was long but when we went up the maitre'd looked at me and said \"You look familiar, have you been here a few times?\".  Of course, me being the honest fellow but not wanting to upset the dood and just wanting to get a leg up on everyone else, I said \"Yes!\"  So it APPEARS he put us at the bottom of the top sheet where there were clearly no open spots left.  w00t.  After about a 30-minute wait (by the time we got in, the wait was up to a hour ... this was 2pm), we got seated.  Service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good.  You have to get the stone crab claws.  They're served cold but with a little lemon and sauce and they are just fantastic.  They crack the claws for you so it's on hassle, just be careful not to inhale small pieces.  The bread is good as well and the onion strings are light and crispy and highly seasoned but insanely addictive.  We also shared a ribeye which looks amusing like Salisbury steak on a cafeteria plate but was decent.  The place is a bit pricey but it's pretty good.  You really should try it if you get the chance.  Stone crab claws: 5/5 Onion strings 4/5 Ribeye: 3/5 Service: 4/5",

The laynoise potato Are out of this world served with tasty caramelized onions on top. If I ever ordered a steak I would definitely get the onions on top of it.

    "text": "The original Joe's Stone Crab is in South Beach Miami. There was only one of them and as far back as the 1990's it was nearly impossible to get a table. They didn't take reservations and it was at least an hour to 2 hour wait for a table. It didn't matter what your celeb status or fame was. You waited in line just like everyone else.  Except for me thankfully. A distant cousin of mine used to be the Captain of that restaurant. The Captain is basically the main host and in charge of the staff.  I ate there many many times whenever I would visit and Joe would even give me a box of some stone crabs packed on ice to fly back home which was NYC back then. My friends and I would feast as soon as I got home...LOL...   The reviews I've read sound like it's the same ownership group or a very very good copy cat of the original.  The original Joe's was famous for the Key Lime Pie, crab cakes and other items mentioned in some of the reviews.  I will have to check this place out for myself as I'm only living here 3 weeks now. The original was always a 5 star rating and I would very very rarely rate any restaurant with 5 stars except for perhaps Peter Lugers in Brooklyn. Gosh....I so badly wish there was one here.",

It tops all my other Joe's experiences, also.  All the stars were aligned and EVERYTHING was perfectly cooked and tasted like a dream.    1.  Kushi Oysters on a half shell - These are my favorite type of oysters.  Slightly sweet with a firm meaty texture.  They were on the smaller side size wise, but the flavor was great. 2.  Select Stone Crabs with Joe's Mustard Sauce - Stone crabs are always awesome.  They're already cracked for you and you dip it in their rich and creamy mustard sauce.  With it being so creamy and rich, it's almost as if they whipped it with butter and cream. 3.  Bone-in Filet Mignon - We ordered this \"rare plus.\"  It was eye rolling fantastic.  Super tender and cooked to perfection. 4.  Sweet Corn (Pan Roasted) - the sweet corn just barely charred and tossed in oh so fabulous butter.  buttaaahhhhh 5.  Havana Dream Pie - This is not regular pie.  This is pie on crack.  It consisted of white cake soaked in sweet milk, topped with freshly whipped cream and drizzled with butterscotch syrup.    Conclusion:  Joe's out did themselves last night, and I am floored.  Eye rolling good.  Usually they're already fantastic, but last night was exceptional.  Hope the future experiences keep up with this one.",

    "text": "4 words:  Terrible service, great food.   Well, I don't stick to 4 words very well, so here's a few more.   The restaurant itself is very nice.  We dined in the main dining room, which was comfortable and cozy.  We had a reservation and on a Saturday night, we did not wait one minute to be seated.  Unfortunately, that's where the good service ended.  Our female server was haughty and condescending, and reluctant to offer any suggestions whatsoever.     So we decided on the Stone Crab Bisque, Bacon-Wrapped Scallops and Select Stone Crab Claws, with a side of mac n' cheese, which seems to be my current obsession.   With the exception of the mac n'cheese, the food was GREAT.  The bisque was better than GREAT, it was amazing!  Lick-your-bowl amazing.  The scallops were perfect, as was the crab.     Dessert?  Who knows?  It was never offered and we couldn't catch our server.  This seems to be happening to me a lot in LV, a less confidant (or less thin, hahahaha) woman would start to assume that the servers think I don't need dessert.  WhatEVER, there is dessert available elsewhere, in the form of cocktails served a little later during the REALLY GREAT Matt Goss show over at Cleopatra's Barge. *separate review posted*   Anyway, not bad value for GREAT food, except for that bad service thing.  I wrote a less than flattering comment about it on Open Table, and received an e-mail from the manager.  I provided him with the requested phone number to reach me, and he did call.  Left a voice mail, which I returned and it ended there.  Not too impressed.    Soooo, once again, a 5 star review becomes a 3 star review due to the bad service.",

Caesars own steak house has superior steak and don't get me started on the Carnevino's and Craftsteaks of the world just minutes away,.  Excellent, attentive service. 5 star experience in that regard. Stick to the crab if you're going here. Something tells me they aren't buying or aging the steaks the same way as when it first opened. Not nearly a hot ticket anymore, reservation and walk up were a snap even during a busy holiday weekend. The trendy and the famous have found other grounds I suppose.   Recommended for the crab. Skip the beef. Sophisticated wine list. Decent beer selection. Superb ice-box key lime pie. Vegas-Dressy. You'll feel out of place with out at least putting on a collar shirt and jeans. Very dressy will also feel comfortable here.   In the Forum Shops, a bit tricky to find if you're coming from Caesars, so worth looking touristy and consulting one of those map \"you are here\" displays.",

When I called to make the reservation the woman who helped me was so delightful, it made us excited for our visit!  The only reason I left off one star was because the night of our visit, we were running a little late, I called to inform them just so we wouldn't lose our reservation & since I am in the restaurant business, I know its a nice courtesy so they can plan for other reservations. When I called and spoke to the Maitre d , he seemed flustered. When I told him we apologized for us being late. He said, \"Just get here when you get here and we'll figure it out.\" He was abrupt and quite cold. I was kind of thrown off guard, and when we finally got there, when we approached the host stand, no one even looked at us for a good minute or two, they were busy having conversations amongst themselves.  Even though we weren't too happy with that,  we were seated right away, they brought over champaign to celebrate our Anniversary! We were soooo ecstatic and very grateful. Our server was SO knowledgable and very understanding when we took a while to order (Everything looked so good and we just couldn't decide!!)  Our food was absolutely amazing and I seriously cant say enough how great the server was.  I would definitely return. It is definitely a place to check out. :)",

I had the oysters on the half shell and the large stone crab.  The oysters were good but DO NOT get the stone crab....it's expensive and it's nothing special.  I have been to this chain in Miami and the stone crab there was much fresher- even then i would not recommend.  The ones here came out partially thawing...just blah!!!  You get 6 for $45 or so...go get yourself a good seafood buffet and you would enjoy it a whole lot more.  Like I said, I have good taste- and this is surly not it.   My friend really liked the steak and seafood bisque on the other hand so hence the 3 star.  I didn't taste either though.",

    "text": "Took the recommendation from Yelp viewers and couldn't be more pleased. Best meal during our 6 day stay in LAS Vegas. Food was as delicious as Yelpers claimed. Our waiter Magdaleno was fantastic. Because we were a party of four, he made suggestions that helped us try some of their best dishes in the most economical way.  For example, the Stone Crab comes in 6 pieces, he suggested we have it as an appetizer and order 2 additional pieces do we all had an equal share. For the entree, he suggested we share 2 steaks and have a plate of king crab legs in the center to share. It was perfect! Their steaks are so large, we could barely finish half so that was a great suggestion. They have the most delicious house cocktail, South Beach Peach. You can have it for dessert too. But, don't miss out on the Key Lime Pie. That was to die for! Just like the many Yelpers suggested. Check it out, you'll be glad you did. Ask for Magdaleno, tell him his friends from Hawaii sent you.",

Started with cocktails....very nice. Had salads & steaks and they were pretty darn good. Steaks cooked perfectly. Service was good and attentive.  Joe's of Las Vegas: You are A-OK in my book of places to eat. Not quite as good as my Chicago locale but very close. Good job!  Cheers to all",

We were greeted by an older gentleman who smiled and said he be happy to have us join them for dinner.  We were promptly seated at one of the \"outside\" tables that are in the mall.  Our server was named Joe.  I wondered if that was a coincidence given the restaurants name but forgot to ask.  Joe was super friendly and after some small talk gave us a rundown of the menu and specials for the evening.  He also told us that portions were large so sharing is recommended.  We wanted to keep it light so we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with a side of sauteed broccolini to share.  While we waited for the food we were sent out a bread basket and everything was delicious.  Our favorites were the pretzel bread, the cheese crisp and the corn bread.  The corn bread was amazing, you could taste the freshness.  Our fish was cooked perfectly and the Asian style sauce mixed with butter yielded some decadent mouthfuls that were perfectly balanced.  The broccolini was seasoned well served as a good compliment to the bass.  I would have loved to try a desert but we needed to head out.  Before we left Joe told us about a shortcut to get to Omnia that saved us a good deal of time in life.     Overall, I am at home in California thinking about how perfect that Sea Bass was and looking forward to when I might be able to head back and dine at Joe's again.",

I've never had stone crab before and it was so great (not to mention the info on how they take one claw from the crab and throw it back as it will regrow its missing claw--??thanks buddy???).  We had oysters which tasted wonderfully fresh for the desert! :)  Our sever made recommendations which were spot on and was present but not pushy.  Our table had the halibut special which was a the largest piece of fish I've seen served and has wonderful flavor & cooked to perfection. A few tips - get a reservation, and don't walk in from the main Caesar's entrance or Bellagio side as it will be a loooooooong walk to the entire other end of the Caesar's property.  Enjoy this dining treat!!!",

Asparagus was a bit overcooked and flavorless and bread wasn't homemade and was average. Stone crabs had great flavor but mine didn't \"peel like a hard boiled egg\" so it was hard to get the meat out (and not much meat). We tried three types of pie and all were great (key lime, peanut butter, banana creme).",

My fiance and I are considering hosting our wedding reception here and wanted to try out the food and check the place out.  Get the Crab cakes.  Two of them.  They are the best crab cakes I have ever had.  It's 95% crab, 5% cake.  Flavorful, light. and delicious.  I tried the stone crab (which they are famous for) and they were good.  Not great, but good.  We also tried their mac and cheese and a petit filet mignon.  Mac and cheese was creamy and great.  Filet was cooked perfectly and was amazing.  We had their key lime pie for dessert, it tasted homemade and was once again the best I've ever had.  You will not be disappointed in the food.  And the service was top-notch.",

I would skip the grilled shrimp appetizer. It was a lil greasy, nothing special. I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly to my liking. The side of dry house seasoning was a delish add!

    "text": "This restaurant is the PERFECT version of the great traditional American restaurant.  It is everything you want it to be.  It is confident, delicious, but not stuffy.  In Miami, Joe's has been around forever, but it doesn't suffer from the \"grand old favorite\" syndrome -- where everything feels tired and under glass.  This is classically-presented seafood, with exceptional service and stylish decor.  On a personal note, I still remember the delicious meal I had at Joe's in Miami, 18 years ago!  My mouth still waters.  When I discovered that Vegas had an outlet, we raced over.  I believe this is the only West Coast version of Joe's... so it's like a rare bird sighting.  Grab it if you can!      The food?  Ah!  The bread basket was crispy and delicious.  The Bloody Mary's were insane -- filled with shrimp and incredibly yummy.  A second round was called for!  The crab bisque is rich and wonderful, with the broth poured over a bowl stacked with crab.  Yum!  The Caesar Salad is fresh and terrific.   The oysters are fabulous, with a fine selection, and the server quite knowledgeable about their different qualities.  And the piece de resistance... the reason to travel to Joe's... are those Stone Crab Claws.  Joe's has some special technique for harvesting the crab claws, then tossing the crabs back in the water to grow another one!  It seems like black magic, but it's quite delicious.  We honestly thought we were stuffed and couldn't handle this final course, but the claws are quite truly the most delicious crab you'll ever have.  We ate and ate.  They come with a mustard dipping sauce, which is terrific, though they're wonderful just plain, too.  I assume they fly these crabs in every day from Florida, because the texture and quality was absolutely perfect.   Yes, this is a rave.  One tip: When I tried making an online reservation through Open Table, the system said the restaurant was sold out (a Saturday night on a holiday weekend).  But when I then called the restaurant, they were completely accommodating and fit us in.  So, the personal touch works!",

For about $27 bucks you can either choose filet mignon or alaskan king crab, two full size sides and dessert.  Portions are pretty big. I think two people can share one order. We ordered two and wasted a lot of food. The bread basket they give you is really good so you will fill up on that as well.  Stone crab just taste like crab but the claws have a lot more meat. And the shell is really hard, hence the name, I guess. They don't have the sweetness that the dungeness crab has so I do miss that.  They do run out of stone crab so go early and order early. The table that sat next to us came later and when they were ready to order, they already sold the last order.",

Joes is consistent, fresh, yummy, excellent, fulfilling, and fast....(i could go on longer but I'll refrain) I do not like crab. Ugh crab is just so foul, so what do you order when the place is known for crab... salmon! oh my goodness, I love love their salmon. Then again I love all salmon but there is spectacular. Do NOT get it with their buttery sauce, it is perfect with just a hint of lemon. Mmmmm. My father likes to try other things so I would nibble off his plate since I cannot stray from the salmon. I've had their steak, I don't know which kind but wow. For a seafood place they can make a steak. Let me explain: My dad likes to get steak cooked black and blue, literally only warm on the inside, disgusting, and when I still had a bite I was in love. I didn't feel that I was just eating a lab of undercooked meat, I was gourmet-ing. THe ambiance is nice, the food is awesome, the service is sufficient, the key lime pie is fantastic. Joes is the place to go. But don't just take my word for it, try it yourself",

(the sucker was BLOODY!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the \"customer is always right\" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice. but hopefully,hopefully, he was just having a really bad day and the 3rd times not the charm. maybe its changed to the 4th! ('cuz that crab was pretty good!)",

Service was excellent, wine was picked to the tastebuds delight as it was the Houghton cab/shiraz 06.  I had the Ribeye Steak and it was cooked perfect and the sauce for the steak was very different than what I have had for steaks and I really liked it.  My girlfriend had the halibut and it was cooked very good as well.  The main thing that made it appetizing were the stone crabs, they are served cold but the claws are definitely worth a try.  If you love those little crustaceans which are different from the dungeness crab, they are worth it.",

How many times have you spent way to much in a restaurant where the waiter could care a less about you, your meal or even know how things are prepared.  Well at Joe's the wait staff is a partner (in a good way) in your meal. We had all the best stuff here.  Stone crabs, sea bass, bone-in rib eye, wedge salad and a great pinot.  All were top shelf and when needed our waiter helped make ours minds up and steered us in the right direction.  Go to Joe's, yo will not be disappointed.",

The bf and I started out with their yummy crab cake. All meat and almost not bread filler. We passed on the stone crab because we like our seafood hot rather than chilled but everyone around us were cracking away. Perhaps another time. The bf then followed up with a killer 220z steak. I had sole but it wasn't anything to write about which is the reason I am giving it a 4 instead of 5 stars. Our desssert was the delicious banana foster pie. Very yummy and fresh. I was very appreciative of the service because they were great. They were always around to refill our drinks but not hovering incesstantly. They knew when to give us our privacy and when we were ready for the next part of the meal. Overall, it was a great start to a lovely weekend in Vegas.",

I was fortunate to go with the in-laws so I wasn't picking up the tab.....(thank god!).  The bad part now is I'm hooked, so next time I go to Vegas, I'm going to have to fork down my own money for this place.  I will do it though, because I had the best meal of my life when I went.  I started with a ceasar salad which was fresh, flavorful and prompt.  Followed by a bone-in filet mignon that was the best steak I'd ever had in my life (and this coming from a person who is a meat eater and loves her fancy steakhouses....Ruth Chris' doesn't compare!).  I also had rice pilaf that was tasty.  The rest of my party had the crabs / lobster and they said it was wonderful (\"The best they ever had\"!).  Didn't order any drinks (didn't want to put the in-laws in the poor house), but I'm sure they would have been good too.  Service was sufficient and knowledgable.  highly recommend, but be prepared to take out a small loan to pay for this meal.  My bone-in filet came with a $50 price tag (that's just for the meat, not the sides and etc) and the Lobster rolled in at $69.95 (Wow).  Well worth it though!",

    "text": "Joes Stone Crab is located in Caesar's Palace, in the Forum Shops.  Reservations are a must on weekends or you will likely have a long wait in the bar.  Service is always professional and attentive and the atmosphere is great- we always request a booth.  They have a nice bread basket with this pretzel bread that my husband loves.  The stone crabs come in several different sizes, the difference being the price and the amount of work you have to do (larger and more expensive crabs require less work, and come 5 to an order).  They are served with a yummy mustard sauce and sides are a la carte.  They have a delicious creamed spinach with roasted garlic cloves, and a super sweet roasted corn.  I have also had the parmesan crusted halibut here, which is delicious and is served in a lemon butter sauce.  Their dessert menu is extensive, featuring every traditional pie (strawberry rhubarb, apple, coconut cream, peanut butter, key lime, boston cream, etc) and they have an incredible peppermint ice cream that comes with hot fudge sauce.  It is the stone crab and that peppermint ice cream that keep me coming back here.  Definitely worth trying, especially if you have never had stone crab!",

    "text": "While I'm not normally a fan of restaurants transplanted from their original location, I must say that Joe's in Las Vegas is one of my favorites.  There are pictures in the restaurant from Miami Beach, FL however their website only mentions a sister restaurant in Chicago so I'm not sure if this is truly related to the Miami Beach location.  Regardless, I love it there and I eat there almost every time I visit Las Vegas.  I usually get a stone crab appetizer assuming its the proper season.  The crab is always delicious although this past visit there were a few small pieces of shell that I had to pick out as I removed the meat (maybe this is normal?)  For my main course I usually have some type of fish and whatever I've had always tastes fresh.  My dining companions had fried shrimp which was crispy and yummy and another companion had a steak which was also up to fine steakhouse standards.  Side dishes were corn (among the best corn I ever had) and two types of potatoes.  I had key lime pie for desert which tasted like what I've had in Key West.  I was told it was made with genuine key limes which isn't the case with most restaurant versions.  While ordering, our server gave us the option of having two 1/2 sides of two different kind of potatoes when she saw we were indecisive of which to order.  A small touch like this goes a long way.  On that note, something that differentiates this restaurant from the rest is the service.  The service here is always top notch.  Each time I eat here I feel welcome, and enjoy how the staff is efficient without hovering over us.  This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Great food and great service.",

The decor was very nice and the service was excellent!  Just as it should be - everything you need but not intrusive.  We started our dinner with my husband getting oysters and I got the shrimp cocktail.  Both were extremely fresh and delicious!  For dinner, my husband got the king crab legs special.  It was the best he ever had.  They cracked the legs for you right at the table.  I got the filet mignon since I do not eat most seafood.  The steak was so tender and delicious!  We had macaroni and cheese and sauted green beans for sides.  Yum, yum, yum.  Very rarely do I find macaroni & cheese as a side, so I jumped on the chance to order it since I just love mac & cheese!  For dessert we had the apple pie w/ vanilla ice cream.  Another cool thing that our waiter suggested was half orders on the sides and dessert.  We got the half size for the dessert and it was still enough for the two of us!  It was nice of him to offer that option.  The whole dinner was so fantastic, my husband rated it as one of the best meals he ever had.  I loved it as well.  I highly, highly recommend this restaurant.",

I have to say, THANK YOU Joe's for coming to Las Vegas.....but I hope one day you will come to Los Angeles!  I came here with my family for dinner and had such a great experience. With superb customer service and top notch seafood, I wish I could give this restaurants 10 stars!  Crab bisque- smooth buttery soup filled with crab pieces. Just perfect to share.  Ahi Tartare- chunky pieces of ahi that were not overwhleming or too puny. Perfect in size. The ahi just melted in your mouth; not overly seasoned.   Stone Crab- How can you not get stone crab here? It is famous...you almost want to bypass it, but you just can't resist. We got the select size since it wouldn't be too small nor too pricey! YOU MUST TRY THIS!  The crab piece just fell apart and it tasted so flavorful.   Crab Cakes- This has got to be the best crab cake or just in par with Boston's Legal Seafood crab cakes. I don't even know what to say, but it is just tons of crab pieces and not much of a filler. You hardly ever get that anywhere.   Alaskan King Crab Legs- You can technically buy this at any grocery store, but I wanted to see how different it would be in a restaurant. It is basically the same, serve chilled with a complementary dipping sauce.   Seared scallops- huge scallops seared perfectly with a slight crust on top! BAM. the potato puree was the perfect addition.  Sea Bass with bok choy- you can never go wrong with sea bass. Sea bass' texture is always flaky and buttery. The sea bass probably literally melted in my mouth with every bite.   Filet Mignon- you definitely can't go wrong with the filet mingon! perfectly grilled. Just enough tenderness and a smooth cut everytime you poke your knife in it! Flavor was on Fleek!  Key Lime Pie- Basically couldn't decide on which dessert. We heard raving reviews on the key lime pie, but their signature was the boston cream pie. The key lime flavor had the perfect balance of sweet and sour. Not one side was more overpowering than the other! I can just imagine eating another slice right now.   Boston Cream Pie- I usually hate all that creamy stuff, but this you will not regret! The cream was light and fluffy, the cake could have been smoother but all in all, every bite was consumed  We were a hungry family and ate literally everything on this menu! My favorite spot in Vegas and would love to come back again.",

To finish the meal we had the key lime pie with a side of melted chocolate for dessert. The melted chocolate was a suggestion that was made by Melanie because I told her about my trip to the Key West where they served chocolate covered key lime pie on a stick! Safe to say, it satisfied my craving. I'll be ordering that every time.    The food is excellent and the service is outstanding! Our server Melanie was able to anticipate every need prior to even asking for it. You don't get that with a lot of servers.   To give a place 5 stars it would require food, service, and ambiance. You really can't go wrong at Joe's. It's a classic!",

He made sure we always had a drink in front of us (Which is always important in Vegas), and educated the guests that had never visited Joe's before. Of course when our appetizer's came out, they were delicious and cooked to perfection. The Madagascar Shrimp is a MUST! My 12oz Filet was cooked exactly the way I asked for it.

If you go to Joe's you will be in for a 5 star steak and seafood dining experience from the quality of the food down to the service they are hands down the best. My favorite dishes are the Dover Sole and the king Crab. I generally order the Sole and the seafood well. We always order multiple entrees and split everything. The Dover Sole is always deboned tabled side with the butter sauce drizzled on top makes for a delicious dinner you won't regret.",

Good thing is it's a great shareable place to keep costs down. If you split the mid claw appetizer and steak you are super full and thoroughly full. Bread basket is awesome and salad selection is great. Great craft cocktails at the premium end. It's in the forum shops so not as intimate as you might like but once in the main dining room your in Miami chilling. Impeccable service with group support so never left wanting. Love the crab claws for appetizer then followed up with ribeye. While crab is the unique aspect - don't underestimate the steak. One of the best in a great steak town. Hefty bar with exceptional scotch selection. Great couple place (if you have an awesome women who loves steak - if not I will pray for you). Great business dinner place if on expense account with varied menu.",

We wee staying next door at the Bellagio, so we figured we would give Joe's a try because we we all seafood lovers.   We started with a half dozen of raw oysters and stone crab claws. The oysters were juicy and delicious to the point I didn't want anything except a dab of the vinegar ice to go along with them. We had an assortment of oysters, and I particularly liked the Stellar Bay and Naked Cowboy.   Our stone crab claws were also delicious. The shell was peeled away much like a hard boiled egg, leaving the juicy meat exposed for us to devour, which our group did pretty efficiently.   Appetizers consumed along with a half bottle of wine, we moved onto dinner. I had my sights set on the grouper, but our waiter made a gentle nudge to the Chilean Sea Bass, telling us it was flown in that morning. It was a great suggestion and I'm happy he recommended it, because it was outstanding.  It came by itself, but we ordered a variety of sides to go along with it, and it was plenty filling and perfectly prepared.   One person at the table ordered the scallops, and I have to admit I had a little bit of food envy. I sweet talked her into giving me a bite and almost took her plate. I was secretly hoping she ate too much bread and wouldn't be able to finish her dinner, but she did.  Joe's is known for their seafood, prime steak and stone crab. They definitely got the seafood and stone crab right!",

They have a main dining area where the bar is as well as a \"patio\" out front inside of the forum shops.   The Maitre D' is a man of few words, but runs the restaurant very well. We had a nice table for 6 set up on the patio for our 6 PM reservation. The service all around was excellent from our waiter and sommelier to the gentlemen who prepared our king crab legs.   We started off with classic wedge salads and chowder. We ordered a platter of the large stone crabs as well as Alaskan king crab legs. For our side we went with their hash brown potatoes (Sooo good!!), charred brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Everything we ordered was excellent.   The stone crabs were so fresh having been flown in that morning. I absolutely loved the mustard dipping sauce as well, perfect pairing. The king crab was also excellent. The large legs are already split, all you need to do is pull out the meat and dip it in that warm drawn butter. Heaven.   The hash browns were another favorite. So crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. For dessert we had Joe's famous Key lime pie. Probably the best I have had. Perfect balance of sweet and tart and the crust was fantastic.   Will definitely return soon!",

The bread basket had a nice variety of breads, but the onion bread was my favorite. For my appetizer I had the calamari on a bed of couscous. This was a very generous portion and had a very fresh taste. I'd surprisingly never had calamari that wasn't fried and really enjoyed that Joe's serves their calamari fresh without frying. My husband started with mussels which were plentiful and flavorful. The broth they were in was delicious. My entree was the steak au poivre which had a nice peppery topping with tasty mashed potatoes. My husband's Copper River salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. The corn on the plate was amazing, I have no idea what they did to it, but I couldn't stop stealing his corn. We wrapped up with key lime pie and blueberry pie. I liked the key lime filling flavor, but the crust was kind of bland. My blueberry pie wasn't amazing, but satisfied my sweet tooth.   We'll definitely be back as my husband has declared this his favorite seafood restaurant in town.",

    "text": "Stars 3.5  Located in the forum shops at Caesars Palace.  First impressions,  it was packed when we arrived for our 6pm reservation and there is a lot of seating.  They have \"patio style\" seating, then \"bar style\" seating inside the doors, then the formal seating in the back.  We had reservations for a party of 13 people. The table they had set up for us was for 10 people, they said there was nothing they could do, as the restaurant was fully booked.    I ordered:   Charred Octopus - very good flavour and melt in your mouth tenderness.  Bone-In Filet Mignon - cooked exactly how I asked for it, but to be honest, the quality of beef at home is much better.  Sauteed Broccolini - very small portion for a side  Hash Browns (Big Daddy Style) - it sounded better when the server was describing it.  It's a huge portion, so I would share it with 4 or 5 people.  It's hash browns mixed with bacon and sour cream, covered in cheese and baked.  Service was good, other then the seating arrangement.  Drinks were always refilled, answered all our questions, gave us ample time to decide.   Overall Experience: Service - 8.5/10 Cleanliness - 9/10 Food - 9/10 Value - 7.5/10 Parking - N/A",

    "text": "On the lower floor of Caesar's, near the entrance/exit facing Harrah's.   Pricy place but absolutely worth it. The 24oz medium-rare bone-in ribeye for $59.95 is one of the best steaks I've ever had! Excellent marbling and cooked consistently well. Perfectly seasoned and great crust, with melting extremely beefy meat on the inside.   Their large stone crabs that come with 5 per order are suuuuuper expensive at around $70 but it was extremely delicate, sweet, and delicious! Probably not worth it, but I enjoy splurging on it if I've had a good run on the tables.    Annoying but not unusual is that all sides are a la carte. They are about $10 each and are huge so you'll need to share. I tried the crispy onion strings, 4 cheese mac and cheese, and cottage potatoes. Try the onion strings, they are really crispy and have a great depth of garlicky/oniony flavor on them. This was the best side we tried. The mac and cheese was disappointing - not seasoned enough, and the sauce is a bit watery. The cottage potatoes are thinly sliced fried (or baked) crispy potatoes, very tasty as well.",

    "text": "You just won some cash in Caesar's?  First, take it and run.  As you pass all the shops in the Forum Mall, keep moving -- you don't need an Armani suit or a Breitling or whatever boxing memorabilia Mike Tyson is presently autographing in Field Of Dreams (plus, you don't give cash to rapists).    Keep moving past a variety of pretty good restaurants, and just before you reach the doors leading out to The Strip, head down the curved escalator  In the basement of the Forum, you'll find Joe's.  I try to make a stop at Joe's during every Vegas trip, big winning or no.  Often times it's my last stop out of town.  A plate of Stone Crab here, naturally, is a wonderful thing.  I like to start of with 6 of the Select ones.  They come with a dijon mustard sauce, which is great, but drawn butter is available.    I like to follow up the crab with a steak, usually a filet, medium rare.  While I recommend going during lunch for a guaranteed, immediate seat, I don't recommend the petite steaks served as lunch specials; get one of the thick, real cuts from the dinner menu.  I once shared an amazing porterhouse done black & blue style (blackened and pepper crusted on the outside, so rare almost blue on the inside).   Crab and steak, that's enough to make me happy, but it's easy to get distracted by the sides here.  They're a la carte, and they can be addictively delicious, like the grilled tomatoes topped with spinach and cheese and the baked mashed potatoes.      There's a variety of wine-by-the-glass available.  On my last visit, I had an excellent glass of Frog's Leap Merlot, which was soon followed by another.  Both the table and bar staff are attentive, extremely knowledgeable, and dressed impeccably.  There are at least 3 dining areas here -- \"outside\" in the mall, by the bar, and inside in the back.  But for lunch of solo dining, the bar is an excellent option.    After the full Joe's experience, you may find yourself with much less of your gambling winnings, but the happiness and satisfaction that comes from an excellent meal beats the futility of returning winnings to a casino or gifting them to a former athlete.",

The bread was not bad, comes in variety and my favorite was the cornbread.  I had my entree mixed up and they gave me halibut, which was fine because it's one of my top fishes. The sauce goes well with the fish since it's more plain.   The big joe potato was crazy, it's not on the menu and you can feed like 6 people. Comes with grilled onions, bacon, chives, cheese and sour cream and just mad flavor.   Skirt steak had Argentinan flare to it with peppers on the side. Chimmy sauce was salty so the line helped.  Basically, couldn't finish dinner and had to bag it all to go. Didn't get desert although I would of gotten the pumpkin pie.   Overall, service was nice, sorta busy and slow but food was not bad.",

    "text": "What an exceptional Restaurant!    I surprise my wife and take her out on a Saturday night.  Unfortunately it was the same weekend that the Billboard awards were in town and there was over a 2 hour wait.  Thomas, the Maitre D', humbly apologized, but there was no way to get us in sooner.  I explained to him that it was our first date night in a long time.  I surprised my wife with a sitter, we recently saw the Stone Crabs on T.V. and really craved it etc...He asked us to wait by the bar and he would see what he could do.  We figured we could see some industry people so we went to the bar and waited.  I think I see Carley Rae Jepsen here.  Darn, I have that song now in my head... \"Hey I just met you, call me crazy, so here's my number, so call me maybe...\"  20mins later, Thomas comes by and says he could seat us and thanked us for the wait.  He knows how it was to get out on a date night and wanted to accommodate us.  From the start, we were given the VIP treatment.  As our server, Ashley, was placing the napkins on our lap, she noticed I had dark pants.  I usually request a dark napkin, but she immediately said \"I'll go and get you a dark napkin\" without hesitation.  Knowing and predicting my needs before requesting, sign of great customer service.  Another mark of an exceptional restaurant is that they left my wife and I alone most of the time.  This gave us the opportunity to talk and spend time together without interruption.  This is not to say they were not attentive.  They were more than attentive, but they did it in the background.   They worked as a team.  The person filling our water, the person bringing our bread, the person clearing out table, everyone was exceptional.  They knew exactly what was needed at our table and would rarely need to ask.  I would look down and have a fresh glass of ice tea.  Working as  team to help each other to make sure the client experience was exceptional.  Obviously we were there for the Stone Crab Claws, but Ashley made a suggestion of their signature table side Cole Slaw.  Cole Slaw?  She said we would not regret it and she would make it personally.  The Stone Crab was obviously amazing.  Sweet, succulent and delectable, with a hint of tang and heat on the back of the palate from their homemade mustard sauce.   When I die, I want heaven to be made of marshmallows, rainbows and Stone Crab Claws from Joe's!  And she was right, I absolutely loved the table side Cole Slaw.   When the meal was finally over, Ashley comes over to the table and brings over 2 bowls with a hot towel and lemon in each bowl.  She squeezes the lemon on our hands for us and we proceed to clean our hands with the towels.  This was going above and beyond on the service.  As we were done with our dinner and leaving, Thomas asked \"Mr. & Mrs. Chan, where you happy with your experience here tonight?\"  I explained how it was one of the most exceptional times at a restaurant I've had and would be telling everyone about it.  He handed me his card and thanked us for joining them that night.    Needless to say, we've been back a few times, including my 40th birthday dinner.",

    "text": "Score a reservation for Mother's Day at this great restaurant. Our party of 5 was seated about 10 minutes after we arrived. The server was knowledgeable, friendly, and appeared to genuinely enjoy working at Joe's.  We started off the night with the special Stone Crab Claws. These are the famous claws from Florida that are harvested from the crabs without killing them. I saw an episode of Man Vs Food and put it on list of things to try if I was ever in Miami. Just think how excited I was when I learned that this restaurant was started by the owners of the Miami restaurant.  Back to the claws, one word - AMAZING -. Being Filipino, I have been exposed to some awesome seafood. The combination of salt water and sweet crab meat was incredible. Each of us has two claws each. I could have had more, but the meal had just started.  For my entree, I ordered the bone in Rib Eye \"Oscar Style\". Oscar style is when you add crab meat, steamed asparagus, and hollandaise sauce on top of your meal. The steak was cooked to order (Medium Rare) and the \"Oscar Style\" topped off the meal excellently.  Whenever I come back to Las Vegas, I will definitely stop by and have another meal at Joe's.",

    "text": "Service: 3/5; Food: 4/5; Location: 2/5 (only because the hostess didn't know where she worked - see below). Overall: 3.5/5 - Would come back for the food and to try the Stone Crab.  My friends and I came here pretty late with reservations at 9:30PM. (PS: Make sure to have reservations). I'll tell you now, but this restaurant is in Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. For some reason, when we called the restaurant to ask where the restaurant was, I was told it was in the Cosmopolitan. When I called a second time, I was told it was near Planet Hollywood. FINALLY, on the THIRD call, (keep in mind I was in a taxi the whole time) I was told that it was at Caesar's Palace. Ugh. Come on now. You don't even know where you're working at!? The service, even at 9:30PM, was just alright, which is a bit disappoint since it is Vegas. We had to flag down someone several times to get our water cups filled and the food came out slowly. Our server looked and acted doubtful toward us as if he was judging us by how young we looked. (Asians just naturally look younger, but we ARE legal!!)   The food itself is definitely high quality and somewhat small portions; on top of the fact that it is Vegas, the prices were definitely price-y. The Stone Crab was sold out (tip: come early if you want to try), so we settled for the king crab, six oysters, and salt and pepper shrimp. What I enjoyed was that with the crab, there was someone who would open the crab in front of you. Served with butter and lemon, the crab had a nice, sweet flavor with great texture. The oysters were creamy and came with a vinegarette and tabasco sauce. Lastly, our salt and pepper shrimp was fried and paired well with the creamy lemon aioli dip and lemon juice.  The ambiance is extremely classy and has an upscale vibe. The interior decor is beautiful and seems slightly antique. Suited for both groups or dates; it's both intimate and comfortable. It is dimly light, but somehow the room glows; I'm assuming the light bounces off the decor.   Overall, would return to try Stone Crab and steak, in addition to their seafood selection; although when I do come back, I hope service to be better considering their reputation is of high quality.",

Service was excellent. Love the pretzel rolls. We had six of the medium crabs - very good. I had the Salad Nicoise, which was good but not great. My friends all had the seafood salad and raved about it. The best part of meal was dessert. Their pies are over the top. We had coconut, peanut butter, the chocolate (mousse?) pie and a pie/cake item that no one can remember the name  of, but we all remember how good it was.  We didn't intend to eat them all-but we did. That good. We had a few glasses of wine and coffee. And the check with tip was almost $400. I took 11 people to Mon Abi Gabi three days later, as much food, more alcohol - and the tab was $540. Joe's is good, I like it a lot.  But, I wouldn't go there on my dime. The prices are out of whack. Even for Vegas.   I would go back for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee though.",

Have visited numerous times both for lunch and dinner.  Service has never failed.  Food has never failed.  They are awesome from the moment you are greeted to when you leave.  Typically I always ordered the Stone Crab claws for the main, but have decided in the last two visits to have the filet as the main and start with a lighter amount of Stone Crab to start.  Amazing beef, cooked to my asking, with a good seasoning.  Awesome!!!  Try to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas but is always busy so try to book a few days before.",

We made a reservation in advanced because we weren't sure how busy they get on the weekends.  We get there and we get seated, the light and atmosphere is very romantic.  Our waiter gave us complimentary champagne, which was really nice.  The staff was very friendly and professional.  He ordered the Fisherman's platter and it was delicious (yes I took a couple bites from him).  And I ordered a 3 large Pacific rock crab claws (unfortunately they ran out of the stone crabs but was not disappointed).  The meat was so sweet and so fresh, I was amazed by each bite!  The sauce that comes along with it compliments the sweetness of the crab meat so well!  We also ordered a Baked sweet potato and Mac & cheese.  They were both delicious!  The potato was so soft and the pecan butter it came with added a hint of sweetness I like.  The mac & cheese was not overpowering with a cheese taste (which I never find when I order mac & cheese).  And lastly for dessert, we ordered Banana cream pie.  It was excellent!  Not an overpowering banana taste with great sweetness from the foster sauce.  Overall our experience was wonderful and very relaxing.  Of course the bill is going to be high, but it was expected.  We'll definitely be back for more.  Next time, I will try the stone crab they are so famous for!",

To start : Dirty Martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.    Appetizer : Madagascar Shrimp - You can order just one, cause it's that BIG.  We shared it as an appetizer.  Sweet and tender.  Served with a side of aoili sauce, however, I didn't hardly use it as the shrimp was so delicious.  Entree - Large stone crab; Melts right in your mouth.  You don't need any dipping sauce or butter.  The taste is pure heaven.  Steaks - All steaks are perfecto.  They are lightly seasoned and then brought to the table with a side of herbs, pepper and salt for you to drizzle over yourself.  Sides - Lyonnaise Mashed potatoes.  Oh MY Yumminess.  Creamy, buttery and cheesy.  Dessert - Peanut Butter Cream pie - Good, but VERY rich.  I could seriously only have like 3-4 big bites and I was done.  SERVICE  here is top NOTCH.  I never have to ask twice or wave anybody down.  Each table comes with a server and like 2 other staff members to help take away plates and clean up bread crumbs.  I just LOVE IT HERE SO MUCH.  I could seriously fly in for a day just to each here.",

We love Joe's so much that we held our wedding reception here last Saturday in the Gigi Room and we were so thrilled with the entire event. The Joe's staff was amazing, attentive, on top of everything, and very friendly.   Joes' standard restaurant customer service is fantastic and down to a science, but they far exceeded our expectations with the private event service as well. Notable was how fantastic the lead server, Erica was. She was so attentive and really took care of things so well that the Groom and I were able to thoroughly enjoy our entire reception. Oh AND, the bartenders kept my glass full with VERY generous pours! Cheers to that!   The room set up was perfect and exceeded any vision I had. Nicole (the event coordinator) did a wonderful job bringing our wedding reception dreams to life.   Everyone at the wedding is STILL raving about how great the food was, how much they enjoyed their time at Joe's, and how much fun they had. We had the Salmon, Filet and Chicken all served for our guests and everybody loved everything they ordered. I had the salmon and it was honestly the most perfectly cooked salmon I have ever had. Sides were green beans and mashed potatoes. Apps were crab cakes, tenderloin, asparagus tips, scallops and stuffed mushrooms. ALL delish!   The REAL guest of honor: Stone Crab claws. If they're available, GET THEM.   Cheers to Joe's for making our big day the best day of our lives.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas for a conference recently and one of my favorite thing to do when I'm on business travel is try new cuisine.  I Yelp'd several places while I was there and was drawn in to Joe's by the pictures I saw of the stone crab claws.  I figured I would give it a try.  When I called to make a reservation they told me the first available reservation was 9:30pm.  That wasn't going to work (I called around 4:30pm and I was already getting hungry), so I decided to mosey over and see if I could do a walk in.  The wait was still about 30 minutes but I saw open seats at the bar and decided to go eat at the bar instead.  I started off my meal with a bread basket - MISTAKE - don't waste your stomach space with BREAD - and a Pimms cocktail.  Next I devoured a Jumbo Shrimp cocktail followed by my main meal which was two large stone crab, mac and cheese and the Chilean Sea Bass.  I was not disappointed here at all, everything was amazing and I quickly let my friends back home know that they have to go here when they are in Vegas.  As a side note the bartender that night (Mark) was fantastic!  He answered all my questions about the food, made great drinks, made sure my glass was never empty and was fun to talk to.  Overall a great experience and I will definitely be back!",

Both dinners took about the same amount of time yet here we never felt rushed.  Appetizer, small order of crab claws. Only issue was small bits of smashed shell. Would have loved melted butter for dipping. 9/10 Grilled seafood platter for main dish. Scallops were perfect, shrimp and lobster were overcooked but just barely. 9/10 King Louie crab salad, wife thought it was great but a bit too cold. 9/10 Desert, apple pie with ice cream. The vanilla ice cream was very good, apple pie was undercooked as apples were crunchy, had no bottom crust, and top crust was overdone. 5/10  Nice to visit a decent restaurant where you do not get an attitude if you only want tap water and if you do not order wine.",

    "text": "After walking around the seemingly endless walkways of Caesar's Palace shops trying to find somewhere good to eat, we found our way to Joe's Seafood Prime and Steak. This is one high class restaurant - you can tell by the variety of fresh breads they bring out as an appetizer. I'm sure Joe's would have been packed if we had been there on a weeknight but we were lucky enough to get seated very quickly for a late lunch.  The waiter recommended the fish and chips for me while my husband got the seafood salad. Of course, we had to just try their signature stone crab legs. They were quite pricey for 2 legs ($7 per leg I believe) but the meat inside was very fresh and the sauce it comes with is awesome. I would recommend getting 1 each just for the experience but not a whole plate full.  The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had. You could tell the fish was fresh and the batter very crispy but not overwhelming most of the fish. The truffle fries were also super tasty and my hubby kept stealing some. His salad had a good amount of seafood piled on top but for the price of $22, he would have been better off ordering fish.   Service was on par and our waiter checked in on us at the right times and didn't forget to fill our waters even though they were busy.   If you are wandering around Caesar's Palace looking for a great meal, don't pass up Joe's.",

Appetizers we had the popular crab claws, not sure of the actual name cuz that's not my thing, and fried oysters. I was told they were pretty good. For the main course we had mac & cheese, potatoes, asparagus and 30oz bone in rib eye. Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted great. The three sides and one 30oz steak was shared between four of us and was perfect amount. The 30oz rib eye is prolly more ideal to share between two if you're really hungry. Overall it was a great experience and will defiantly come back.",

The Stone Crab is delicious...the King crab is wonderful and the ribeye will make you wanna run across the street and slap the chef at Ruth's Chris.  For two I would recommend: stone crab appetizer, king crab appetizer, split a ribeye - with a side of sauteed asparagus a the mac and cheese.  Order a bottle and enjoy.",

They have an entire vegetarian and gluten free menu (that you do have to request to see) and the vegan options are labeled! I was happy as a clam.  Our waiter was Bradley - he has a wonderful sense of humor and service as well. He kept us laughing and made sure we were all taken care of. My husband and I had to dine pretty fast because we had reservations for a helicopter tour which Bradley did an excellent job of ensuring we made it out on time.  Now the question I'm sure you're all dying to know the answer to... What did I order?! My appetizer was the All Greens salad - a very simple salad, with literally just chopped greens and a few tomatoes. However that's all this salad needs... The dressing is really the star of the plate! It was incredible. For my entree, I got the Cauliflower Steak. I was in heaven! It was absolutely outstanding.  My husband got one of the crab plates, which I could tell he enjoyed since he didn't say a word while he was eating it.  Overall, this was a wonderful experience. I'm so impressed that there was a vegetarian menu, I thought for sure I would only be eating a salad and a few sides for my meal!",

Thank goodness the meal did not stop, we ordered bone in ribeye and sea bass as our entrees. The sea bass was super buttery, and melted in our mouths and the bone in ribeye was also delicious! And I'm usually not a steak person. We also ordered brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The only thing I could have done without was the mashed potatoes. They were good but nothing too spectacular like the rest of the meal. Lastly we finished the night off with banana cream pie and Havana cake (dulce de leches cake). I usually don't like banana either but wow I was in love with the banana cream pie! This place is slightly pricey but definitely worth it !",

Naturally we decided to eat at Joes for lunch today and unfortunately my dad had some medical issues shortly after we ordered (he's okay now). The staff were so nice and didn't make a big scene, but made sure someone was with us the whole time while we waited for medics to come and make sure my dad was okay. The staff member kept it light hearted and chatted with us, and when we went to pay for the bill he told us not to worry about it. They couldn't have handled the situation better and I'm grateful for the calmness and general niceness of their staff.",

We decided to skip the appetizer and go straight to the entree. My girlfriend had the salmon which I quote was \"the best salmon ever...\" It was tasty, light, and cooked perfectly.  I got the seafood platter which honestly had so much seafood I felt like the pacific ocean was inside my plate.   My favorite from the platter definitely had to be the scallops which went well with the white wine sauce and the Madagascar shrimps which was grilled and split in half like a lobster tail. It was delicious, meaty, delicious and so juicy. (Yes I repeated delicious purposely)  The staff is very professional and friendly. Great ambiance.

    "text": "Honestly, I was in the area to get some $1 oysters at PJ Clarke's but they've closed down!!!! :(  So the group and I took the next closest thing, even though we weren't looking to spend a bunch but it happens...  So I went through the cheaper route while dining here so I'm pretty sure I didn't get the full experience.  I ordered the filet mignon (6 oz) lunch special at I believe $27 which comes with Joes Grilled Tomato and Jennies Mashed Potatoes.  It also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which I chose the Havana.    The steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  Honestly, I would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  The tomato was topped with their famous creamed spinach and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  The spinach was very rich and I am glad I didn't get a full order of that.  The sampling was just enough for me.  The potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  A very rich meal that relies on comfort food.    That dessert though.... To sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  They make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  Each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  My friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  Damn. The dessert chef here knows his/her stuff.  Be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.  Service was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. They serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  Although I didn't get order oysters from here, I was still very satisfied. Next time, I'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the stone crabs. :)",

I was not impressed by the food, especially for the price. The Stonecrab was nothing special, so I wasn't sure why it was so highly priced at $75. I ordered the rib eye, and asked for it medium rare. Out of all the cuts of steak we all received, mine looked the shadiest and it was overcooked. However, the server did her best to accommodate me. I got a new steak. While this one was cooked better, it still was noy evenly cooked. For a rib eye, this cut was more lean. While that's not a bad thing for those who would enjoy a sirloin, I ordered a rib eye and expected it to be more marbled and tender. The sides also left much to be desired. I could've cooked a better deal than what I got for a fraction of the price. I do NOT recommend this place.",

We started out with a couple rounds of oysters followed by the seafood platter. Alaskan king crab legs... Need I say more. And cracked down he middle so you don't have to deal with the fuss of cracking the shells. The shrimp were huge. Probably the side of my palm. And we're cooked slash seasoned perfectly. I don't even remember what dipping sauces they gave us. I want to say one was this limey concoction. Don't ask questions just dip, eat and repeat.   We also ordered the stone crab because.. Joes stone crab. Cmon. It was DELICIOUS. Everything was so good my entire team was mmmm-ing and ahhh-ing the entire time we ate. Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach... Mmmmm. Ah man I want to go back now.",

    "text": "The family wanted to go to a seafood restaurant during our vacation. What we got at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab  on Saturday, April 14, 2018 was a surprise and a delight!        My son's shrimp and pasta dish were not only great tasting, but, unlike what happens all too often, filled with shrimp. My wife's crab cakes were almost entirely crabmeat, but still retained structural integrity. They were among the best she ever had.       I have to be honest-I don't eat seafood. I didn't want to be a party pooper, so I went along, praying I could find something-anything-palatable. I'm glad I did.       The New York Strip, medium rare, was among the half dozen best steaks I have ever eaten.      If you want an entrepreneurial opportunity, buy their recipe for steak seasoning. I understand they do bottle it and sell it in some stores. Get it into Giant, Acme, Gristede's, Publix, Winn-Dixie and a few others, and you can retire. I never use toppings on steak. Am I glad I decided to try it tonight-it was amazing!      The cottage fries took home fries up a quantum level. Shaped like potato chips but thicker, they were more seared as opposed to fried, trapping the moisture within. The fried tomatoes were out of this world-tomatoes layered with melted cheese and spinach.       The key lime pie convinced me I had never eaten key lime pie before. Every other piece in my life was a pathetic imitator of the magnificent creation on our table.A cleat, light taste of lime, not overly creamy nor too sweet, with a robust consistency-the recipe let the ingredients shine through.      Our server, Perry, enhanced the meal, from his assistance with the wine selection to dessert and coffee. His stories about the restaurant and about Las Vegas over the years were wonderful.        Five stars!",

    "text": "Outstanding restaurant!  Everytime we go here we are never disappointed.  I always get the colossal stone crab.  The meat is tender and flavorful.  They crack the shells so it's easy to get to the meat.  You can eat the crab straight, with lemon, or dip it into a mustard based sauce.  Either way is great!  It's chilled which makes it soothing against your tongue.  This is a must try!  They no longer dry-age their steak.  They now wet-age their steak.  This new method of vacuum sealing their meat does not hurt the taste or change the complexity of flavor.  There still is a rich meaty like taste.  The bone-in is the best cut, especially when you get to chew on the bone.  We also got Brocollini and Potatoes.  It was okay, but nothing special.  Finally, the Key Lime Pie is outstanding!  It's cold and it's creamy.  The flavors of the tart lime, creamy whipped cream, and textured graham cracker crust work in harmony together.  I cannot wait to go again!",

The bone in rib eye was melt in your mouth flavorful goodness.   Make sure to check this place out! Attire seems casual formal in the main dining area.",

    "text": "Wow...what a disappointment. And it's sad. Really it is. I've been to the Joes in Chicago numerous times and have NEVER had a bad experience there. At this location, however, it could not have been more different. Let's start from the beginning...  Upon entry I was met by this uptight and rude host named Tim. Despite having a reservation and arriving 5 minutes early, Tim did his absolute best to make sure we were treated like and felt like complete crap. He was demeaning and talked down to us. I wanted to leave. Unfortunately it was the only place we had a reservation so we could not go anywhere else. So I just sucked it up and sat down.   Our waiter was fine. He did a good job of explaining the various specials as well as making recommendations that fit our mood. While the food sounded good when he explained it, that was not the case when we ate it. I had the filet...YUCK. I'm not sure if they used old or bad meat but it tasted like an old shoe. It was over cooked and had no flavor. Disgusting. I also had the stone crab which was supposed to be an appetizer but it took forever to arrive. In fact, it arrived AFTER our main course. What a joke!   At this point I was so fed up I did not want to bother with dessert. So I left. I know for a fact I will NEVER come back to this location...at least not until that @$$ hole Tim is fired. What a prick.   Oh, and one more thing. After I complained to the manager about my experience, he LAUGHED at me in my face and refused to shake my hand after the whole ordeal. Disappointing and unprofessional.",

But, 6 hours later, I was deathly ill and spent the next 8 hours in my hotel restroom. It ruined the remainder of my Vegas vacation, as I was in bed for the next 24+ hours recovering. My brother also had the stone crabs, and felt sick, but didn't get it half as bad as me. Love this place, but will never go back to the Vegas location! :(",

Service is awesome with a really attentive staff, and the food is of course high quality in a very traditional way.  If you want something new and exciting this isn't the place for it, but if you want fresh, classic seafood and excellent steaks in a nice ambiance for some event, this is a great pick.  The waiter was very helpful with making wine recommendations for a white and a red.  Our group of 10 shared 2 of the Whale appetizer, each of which serves 4.  It comes with lobster tail, cocktail shrimp, crab, and scallop and shrimp ceviche.  No surprises here, just great classic chilled seafood.  The servings aren't too filling, but everything is super fresh.  The ribeye steak was also excellent.  Maybe not the best I've ever had in my life, but still really, really good and top tier.  Not much to say, just a very normal but perfectly executed steak.  For 3 bottles of wine, a few beers, 2 sides, 2 The Whale appetizer platters, and everyone getting their own steak or seafood entrees, it was $100/person for 10 people.  Expensive but still reasonable, and it was a very enjoyable meal.  I'd definitely recommend Joe's for any special occasion or date dinner in Vegas.",

They didn't inform us that this valet would be closed around midnight. When we returned at 1 am, no one was there. We trekked all the way to the other valet and back... TWICE and finally found a sleeping valet attendant at 1:30 am. (They close at 2 am) Thank goodness, or we would've been charged a $20 overnight fee.",

If I were to have made a comment back then, I probably would have given it a 5-star. But the reason why I'm giving it a 2-star today, is because the waiter that we had was very rude and should not be working there in my opinion. When people go out to eat, they want to feel relaxed you want to feel good and the last thing that you need is a waiter with an attitude. The guy we had was that way. His name is Patrick. A bald-headed man that must be around 70 years old. What is sad about most people, is it when they have a good experience they normally share it when someone asks about how the experience was. However, when someone has a bad experience, they go out of their way to tell people about it whether they get asked or not. And that is what I'm doing right now. I always tip on service not on the amount that I spend on the bill. When the server is good, I always leave a 40 or 50% tip. When they are bad, I want them to know that they are bad so I will only leave a 10% tip. That is exactly what I did with Patrick. I will return to this restaurant because the food is very good, I will just make sure that I do not ask for Patrick and neither should you.",

    "text": "I had to make a reservation for two about two weeks in advance to get a reservation at 5:30pm on a Saturday. That's how good this place is! I'm not sure how busy they are on the weekdays, but I couldn't get a reservation on a Friday night for four when I called earlier the same day.   We were sat right away when we arrived at the restaurant and service was impeccable the entire night. Our server was Bradley and he was amazing! He took great care of us and we were never left wanting. He even offered to take a picture of my Husband and I because he saw my camera out. Very sweet!  Stone Crab- My Husband said this was delicious and he could have ate a whole bowl filled with their claws! He ordered two claws and devoured them. He said it wasn't as rich as King or Snow Crab so he could easily eat a ton of it.  Black Bass- My Husband loved this as well! It was coated in philo dough and cooked perfectly. He said it has great flavor and was a good sized portion.  Cauliflower Gratin- This was cauliflower served with cheese and a little horseradish. I thought it was OK (I'm not a big cauliflower fan) but my Husband loved this too.  Macaroni and Cheese- So yummy! I really liked this and I almost finished the entire thing myself! A bowl of this is good enough for two or three people. Super cheesy with good flavor.  Tender Greens Salad- This was pretty much lettuce and dressing. It was good, and a huge portion. Vegetarians don't have too many options here!  Manhattan Clam Chowder-  My Husband's latest obsession. He thought this was amazing and put all the other chowders he has had to shame. Said the stuff that he buys in the can will forever be ruined after tasting this perfection.  Moscow Mule- Really good and mixed perfectly! I have never had a Moscow Mule before (shocking I know) but this was delicious. It tasted herbal. Yummmmmm.  We will definitely come back here next time we're in Las Vegas! They also have a location in Chicago which we now plan to visit too later this year too. Thank you Joe's!",

On my last visit with husband and another couple we had been walking around looking to eat somewhere. We saw Joes and I told them how amazing it is but I was sure we wouldn't be able to get in without a reservation. We asked and they sat us right then in the bar which was great.  We all opted for other options so no steak but wow everything was good! I had the lobster, shrimp, crab pasta (still dreaming of it) my husband had fried chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and he was also in heaven! We will be back next time in town!!! Super food and service thank you",

I then changed our order to the large claws at $80 per plate of 5, even though I was worried it would be too much food. Imagine my surprise when they bring out two plates of the smallest stone crab claws I have ever seen. After a bunch of nonsense excuses from the mealy mouthed manager, they changed the designation to Select from Large, thereby lowering the price to $60 per plate, which still did correct the mistake, and which certainly does not erase the fact that this was intentional and wishful misconduct, not a simple mistake. Shame on Joe's !!  I suggest you stay far away, as will I in the future.",

I rallied and was able to order a crabcake appetizer, yay, though it wasn't as good as the previous evening's crabcake appetizer---boo.  I ended up with the mahi mahi and it was excellent.  The sides that we went with were the mashed potatoes and the asparagus, the mashed potatoes were BLAND, one tablemate was pouring his clarified butter leftover from his lobster onto the potatoes and the rest of us were adding salt & pepper.  One person suggested that maybe they were instant.  I don't know about going that far, but they were blah.  Our waiter definitely had an attitude, just a \"holier than though\" type of person so it wasn't a great dining experience overall, too bad.    We had dessert too, but I've completely forgotten what it was.  Oh, and we were charged for the wrong glasses of scotch that we had at the end of the meal.  When you're paying $400 for dinner what's $4, but still---get it right.",

    "text": "This is not your average Joe. The food here is pretty spectacular.   Came here for the famous stone crabs and enjoyed them. I hear that stone crabs are a Florida thing so I bet they are better fresh there but these were pretty darn good. They give you a plate full of just the claws BINGO or should I say KENO since it's Vegas.  It's my favorite part of the crab and the meat has a nice sweetness to it.  To top it all off the crabs come already cracked for you. No more man vs. crab, a battle I've lost many times. You practically just slide the shell right off.   I left with no chipped teeth and without any scratches yea-ah.   Also had a nice ahi salad and the crab bisque. Both were delicious.  A nice light lunch except for the Bloody Mary.   The Bloody Mary here was the best I've ever had and I don't normally like bloody mary. It was like a meal in itself. Came with a large stalk of celery and these excellent tomato olives.  Asked for it spicy so it had a nice kick to it. Very flavorful and went well with the crab. No cocktail sauce needed after drinking that cocktail.  All in all a good place. It's not a hole in the wall type of place but it does burn a hole in your pocket. It's a bit on the pricy side but that's to be expected. I mean hey I don't see crab growing anywhere near Vegas. It's expensive to ship them in and I'll gladly pay anyone to crack my crabs for me.",

    "text": "I thought about stealing the container of salt from overseas so I could bathe myself in it later that night. I know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you sprinkled that happiness onto your perfectly cooked filet mignon, you'd want to bathe every inch of yourself with it too. Don't believe me? Try it. You won't complain.  We received a large gift certificate for being frequent diners at Lettuce Entertain You restaurants (see my review of Mon Ami Gabi), so we decided to try Joe's. Since we were starving, and all I could think of was cow and things that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, we dove straight in and ordered entrees...after 2 glasses of wine of course. The red malbec was FANTASTIC and went very well with my cow and sea creatures. My fiance ordered the fisherman's platter, fried, and I ordered the petite filet mignon and jumbo king crab. Our orders were perfection.  Fried seafood is difficult to make and to cook it well enough to maintain the freshness of the seafood and not the dry, overcooked nature of cheap frozen grocery seafood. Joe's doesn't fry their seafood. They lightly dip scallops, shrimp cod and calamari in an airy batter and then after brushing them through an oil bath they place them ever so delicately on your entree plate. They may as well just pop each piece in your mouth because that's what happens when the plate hits the table. This was not fried seafood, this was seafood done right with a blatant disregard for calories. I didn't even have to eat it to know that the look of content on my fiance's face had nothing to do with me.  Now onto the filet. Oh that filet. I love rare cow. If I am at a steakhouse, I will order the steak rare to see if they are truly a steakhouse. Oh yes, my friends, this is a steak house...more like a steak heaven. This petite filet was cooked PERFECTLY. No chewiness here, just soft, tender filet mignon drizzled in the salt mix (please see first paragraph for further loving of the salt mix). Even the waiter was doing a side glance of my cow, knowing that my senses were on overload. The crab? There's a reason they're known for snow crab, but their king crab made me want to do the Snoopy dance in the middle of the restaurant. No butter needed, absolutely no butter needed for this crab...but I did use some anyways because I can never decline butter. The crab was juicy, they cracked the crab for you so you didn't have to cut your hands open doing it yourself, and it melted in my mouth. That dinner was worth every penny we spent and then some. The service, hands down some of the best service I have ever received at a restaurant. Superb.  So while you go and go bananas on some crab legs and filet at Joe's now, I will go to bed and have sweet, sweet dreams of cow and crab. This can only end deliciously.",

The lack of attention by our server was somewhat of a let done.  He came by to take our order and seemed to be on auto-pilot as he went thru the motions of telling us a liitle about the menu.  He took our order and their were a few specifics that my wife had instructed for her entree. I don't think he passed on the info to the kitchen. He dropped the food and hadn't offered to refill any of our beverages and we had to tell the busboy of any further needs that we encountered.You would think when ordering a $65.00 steak that there would be concern about how everything was prepared.He did not stop by once as he was pre-occupied by a couple right next to our table!! Now I'm not saying that I need to be served on hand and foot but a little concern about our experience would be warrented.  Long story short, we summoned the manager who was very helpful and apoligized for the shortcomings and offered us to make the experience better . He lived up to his commitment and I will admit everyone has an off day and all was forgiven. I will be back!! One of the best steakhouses I have encountered and trust me I when I say the Dry aged Ribeye was a memory maker!!",

    "text": "My GF and I took a long overdue vacation to Sin City and when picking out restaurants came across Joe's Stone Crab!  Both of us absolutely love stone crab and based on the reviews and history, there apparently was no better place.  Well, after eating here, all we can say is that the Yelpers and historians are correct!  Our meal started out with a velvety bowl of bisque which if I kept a list of Top 5 bisques, this one would be on it and likely top it!    On the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered the Madagascar shrimp which was the size of a child's hand and could have easily served as the appetizer for both of us.  It was perfectly grilled and skewered with a sugar cane.  It was as succulent as a steak but light on the stomach!  Then, the main events came to the table and they left not one tastebud unturned.  My GF dined on the large stone crabs that were cracked to perfection for ease of eats and the meat was unbelievably sweet and perfectly steamed.  I have had stone crab at many restaurants around the Houston area including Truluck's and Pappas, and as much as it pains me to say this, the stone crab at Joe's made their stone crab feel like it was eaten at a chain restaurant.  I opted to have the stone crab for my appetizer and was definitely wow'd.  However, when a man is presented with a decision of stone crab or nearly two pounds of fresh Alaskan king crab legs, the choice it easy.  The legs were steamed, served cold, and hand cut tableside for ease of eating.  The meat was sweet and melted in my mouth and only needed a dab of the drawn lemon butter that was on the side.  And because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs, our waiter, Andrew, recommended the pan roasted corn.  The corn was fresh off the cob cut into a pan with butter, salt, pepper, and cilantro.  It had a nice bite feel, yet still tender and juicy in the center.  The best part about this side dish is that it had an aroma of fresh popcorn as you ate it.  WOW!  And as good as the food was, the service was far superior to most high end restaurants where we've dined.  Our waiter, Andrew, was extremely knowledgeable and made that great recommendation and the bus staff was extremely attentive to our drinks, and cleaning our tables.  The only thing that prevents me from giving this restaurant a full 5 stars is the $6 san pelegrino and the 2 weak woodford and diets that were ordered!  Otherwise, we say thank you Joe's for one of the best meals of all time!  Food (50%) 5 out of 5 stars Service (30%) 5 out of 5 stars Price (10%) 4 out of 5 stars Decor/Atmosphere (10%) 4 out of 5 stars  Final Score 4.8 Stars",

What made the experience so amazing was our waitress Christina!  Christina is amazing. She is funny, a great server, and knows the menu perfectly. I will absolutely go back again. Also, the overall service is outstanding. The host was super friendly. The bussers we on point, and we're all over it. They worked hard and were perfect. This was my 5th or 6th visit and will ask for Christina in the future. She is incredible. This place is perfect for business dinners, personal fun dinners, or dates. GREAT place!  This was the rest of my party's first time there and they were impressed with both the food and the service. It was my Mom's birthday and she was made to feel so special. I am ecstatic with the experience. Check it out the food is incredible.",

    "text": "After watching a number of shows on Vegas Eats and searching Yelp, I finally decided our fancy dinner night was going to be at Joes! Main reason was due to the combination of both a seafood grille and steak house! We made reservations through Open Table for 7:30 on a Thursday. And we arrived 30 minutes late, why you might ask?! Because the dam can driver dropped us off in front of Caesar's palace and Joe's is located on the other side in the mall! With extremely sore feet the staff at Joes had no problem seating our late party.   After being seated our waiter advised of specials and what stone crabs they had available. Just like many steak houses, items are served al carte and you can order side dishes to share. I settled on a Caesar Salad, Crab Bisque, and the 1 lb. of Stone Crab claws served with the famous Joe's mustard dipping sauce. Three people in our party ordered the bone in ribeye, while the other two ordered Crab stuffed Sole and Filet Mignon.   With glasses of vino in hand we all chatted while waiting for our food to arrive. To our surprise our wait was very short! Salads arrived 1st and shortly after all our food was being served! Caesar salad was tasty, I always love it when it's served with anchovy...adds a saltiness. My crab bisque was sweet and savory, lots of flavor but could have used a bit more crab on the top. Stone Crab stone crab... Where have you been all my life?! My brother in law and I dove in, though my belly was getting full I had to eat this sweet wonderful crab meat. The claws come cracked so after you pull a few shells away, the meat is exposed and dunk away in the mustard sauce. The sauce was tasty but I preferred the crab with a bit of lemon. The ribeye and filet eaters loved the sear on the cut and raved about not only the tenderness but also the perfect way each was cooked!  Service was wonderful. Our waiter knew his stuff and checked on us often. Lol he earned the mandatory 18% tip for our table of six! And Whoop Whoop, he brought us complimentary deserts to share since it was our 1st time!!!   Joe's is simple; the menu was not huge and the items are simple but the preparation along with the service was stellar! We agreed the meal was worth the kick to our pocket books! Very glad I was able to dine at Joe's!",

I wasn't a fan of a few appetizers being shared by everyone. I asked the waiter if I could have my own and he declined, saying that there will be enough for everyone to share. Well, there wasn't. I'd say, if a guest wants their own appetizer, bring them their own appetizer.   Other than that it was a good experience and we enjoyed our time there. Will consider it again in the future, though there are lots of good options in Vegas as most know.",

    "text": "Located at the end of Caesar's Palace near the shops on the first floor, I had a pretty good dining experience at Joe's seafood. I came with a group of 4 and we were all starving so we decided to just order a bunch of food and share it family style due to it being all put first time dining here.  Food   MAC & CHEESE - too cheesy imo and was mediocre at best. Definitely needs some hot sauce or something, but hard to eat just by itself. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)  SHRIMP AND SCALLOP CEVICHE - was pretty decent at first bite, but it has this exotic very strong tangy aftertaste that was too much for me. I'm not sure what flavors made it that tangy but it wasn't too delicious. (NOT RECOMMEND IT)  CRAB CAKE - this was simply delicious. has LOTS of crab and the flavors are amazing. only downfall is that the portion is small but I prefer quality over quantity at a higher end restaurant like this. Comes with their sauce and drizzle the lime on top to get the maximum flavor. (WOULD RECOMMEND)  STONE CRAB MEDIUM SIZE - these stone claw crabs, what they are known for, are not worth the price. It is abour $50 for I believe 6 pieces and it is not that good. Maybe it is because it is served cold, but I like my crab served warm. Taste is okay but would (NOT RECOMMEND IT)  RIBEYE STEAK - This is the holy grail along with the crab cake. It is about a $60 steak and it was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium rare and tasted 10x better than the stone crab legs. Steak is soft and does not need any sauce; just eat as served. (WOULD RECOMMEND)  TENDERLOIN SANDWICH - I was actually surprised by how good this was. The bread was tasty and the meat was extremely soft. Complemented by arugula and horseradish sauce, this dish was definitely my favorite if you consider price. For about $20 you get a delicious sandwich for a third of the price of the ribeye and almost just as yummy. (DEFINITELY RECOMMEND)  Lastly was the amazing service. Overall I think for the cost of the food doesn't match the quality of the food. Food wasn't so amazing that I would want to come back here. For how much I spent, I would rather eat at the Bacchanal Buffet for about the same price. I only rated this a 4 star instead of 3 because of the great service we had here.",

    "text": "I had a good time and enjoyed a good meal at Joe's.  The meal was a little pricey, but not exorbitantly so.  While I think Joe's is a nice place for a good meal, I don't get all the hype; it's not the finest seafood I ever had, and certainly not worth waiting in line over.  After hearing all the rave reviews.  We attempted to go on a Thursday night and called for reservations and were told they were certainly booked for Thursday through Sunday nights.  Our casino bartender told us not to try to walk up, unless we wanted to wait hours in line.  We called back and reserved for Saturday lunch.  Nice decor when we arrived, not crowded at all and plenty of seating both inside and what is technically the \"patio\", since you are still in side the Forum Shoppes.  Classic old wood steakhouse decor.  Basic fine dining prices -high for Las Vegas, but in line and even cheap by New York or LA Standards.  My seared octopus appetizer was very good and priced reasonably at $16 as was the $22 ahi salad.  My friend offered me a couple of his World Famous Joe's Stone Crab claws, and they were fine - sorta fresh, meaty crab legs.  I think he paid a pretty hefty $60 for his lunch.  Beer and wine selection OK and prices on point.  A nice meal for 3 with drinks for under $250 with tax and tip.  Not something I wanna do every day for lunch, but I didn't feel we got gouged. So if you are coming in from Des Moines or Cleveland, and think Red Lobster is fine seafood, Joe's is gonna knock your socks off.  But the best seafood ever, worth waiting an hour in line for?  Don't think so; Blue Point in San Diego or Pacific Cafe in San Fran far superior.",

    "text": "I introduced my son, Ben, to Joe's while he was here for an adult-league soccer tournament, and we and Diane all came away from the 2-hour experience happy diners.  In the distant past, I found the Florida Stone Crab Claws to not be that tasty or worth the work of searching through torn shells to scoop out the meat.  But we were in a stone-crab place, so introducing my son to stone crab claws seemed appropriate.  To make sure that we would have a pleasing appetizer course, I hedged by also ordering a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which I knew would be good.  This time the stone crab meat was an eye-opening experience.  I opted for the large claw variety, one for each of us, and wished I had ordered more as my son and I delighted in the sweet, fresh taste of our crab meat, while Diane did not.  I sampled her claw meat, which was light brown in color and not very tasty, while mine was snow white and delicious.  So, I now know that Stone Crab claws can vary in taste.  And, one is not enough.  But at over $13 a large claw, this is not for those with a low dining out budget!  The Shrimp Cocktail was fine and meaty, as expected.  A bowl of Crab Bisque was up next.  Very good with bits of crunchy garnish, but warm rather than hot.  I appreciated the pitted Black Olives in Joe's Chopped Salad, and liked the Feta Cheese-laced creation, but missed the prosciutto, pancetta, or ham commonly found in Chopped Salads served in Italian restaurants, which I realize Joe's is not.  So, next time I will revert to ordering a Caesar Salad here.    With all of the Surf & Turf combinations I had recently enjoyed on a cruise around South Africa and during the December holidays just past, I took an unusual detour, and swiveled instead to Chopped Steak for my entree, which is prime grade beef, ordered medium.  I should have ordered it medium-rare, because it arrived medium-well.  Yet showered with a carafe of brown au jus, the meaty dish was still quite tasty.  My son loved his Dover Sole, which was deboned tableside (but for 1 small bone), slathered with Buerre Blanc, and an absolutely huge double-sided fish fillet.  And Diane greatly enjoyed her medium-rare filet dipped in Bearnaise Sauce and 10 oz. Lobster Tail dunked in Drawn Butter.  Our server thought that we had ordered enough potato already before I added French Fries to orders of Crispy Hash Brown Potatoes and a Baked Sweet Potato adorned with of all things (Wait for this!) sweet and memorable Praline Pecan Butter.  But crispy Fries just go too well with Chopped Steak to forego.  And, after my son enjoyed a Caesar Salad, we rounded out these sides with tasty Roasted Cauliflower graced by Sage Brown Butter, and a dish of impeccably prepared Sauteed Spinach.  The huge order of slightly crunchy Hash Browns was superior in every sense, and the skin-on Fries fresh and a perfect mate to my Chopped Steak.  The delectable Baked Sweet Potato was just a delightful bonus!    After almost breaking the bank and the calorie count for a table of three, it made no sense not to order dessert.  So our trio split a large slice of Chocolate Fudge Pie topped by clearly homemade Whipped Cream.  Decadent and delicious, and enough for three to share!  Service by our head waiter and his assistant, formally clad in the customary Chi-Town black tux style, was impeccable, and our head waiter very patiently helped me add the Lettuce Entertain You app to my mobile phone, and noticed that my email address was not initially accepted because an undesired space lurked between letters.  Once the technical error was corrected, reward points were quickly awarded and a $20 future dining credit appeared.  This was as close to a 5-star dining experience as one could get without quite getting there.  Hot soup and even a medium Chopped Steak would have vaulted us over that bar.  So, 4-1/2 stars overall, and I will surely be back to order more Large Florida Stone Crab Claws and to afford Joe's another shot at providing me with a 5-star experience.",

    "text": "While looking for a dinner spot to go to before a show at Ceasars the next day, we came across Joes in the Forum Shopping area and were able to get a reservation for the time we needed the next day.    The food and service was great and though somewhat expensive, not nearly as much as other places that tout steaks and seafood in a quiet dining atmosphere.  Their Stone Crab and the King Crab legs are their specialty and we saw many patrons with plates full of them.  I on the other hand wanted a steak and I had the 12 oz filet and tried something different for my side dish instead of the tried and True baked potato, I had \"hash browns\".  Our waiter, Al, said it would be enough for 2, but I guess I didn't hear that.  According to my wife (I don't drink) they have a very good wine list and our waiter, Al, helped her come up with a keeper.  We were brought a nice bread assortment to begin things.  Needless to say my steak was done to perfection and the hash browns were served in a baking dish and were out of this world... even after sharing them with my wife, there was still at least a third of the dish left.  After dinner, Al presented us with a birthday desert (my birthday) and that topped off the evening.  If you are at Ceasar's or in the area, I strongly recommend taking in an evening at Joes then go walk it off at Ceasars or where ever you fancy along the strip.  Cheers....",

    "text": "AMAZING food. Best birthday meal hands down. I had the crab stuffed shrimp and creamed spinach. The restaurant is a la carte. I'm usually too cheap to go to a la carte restaurants, but Joe's was SO worth it.   Me and my girlfriends were in Vegas for my birthday, and the activity we did earlier that day pushed us into arriving at our Joe's reservation later. I called ahead and let them know about our later arrival time (about half an hour late).   When I arrived, I nicely asked if they could give us straight service since we will have no time to converse as friends. They were so kind about the request. We received quick seating, and the waiter notified me that she was alerted about our shortness on time. Her service was quick, friendly, and they even made time to bring me a birthday brownie with ice.   I will definitely be returning. Also, put their Sangria in your life. *drool*",

I came in on a Saturday night and was seated right away at the bar area.   Sad to say, this time around I was very disappointed with the stone crab. I opted for the 7 pcs medium sized claws. One claw was still frozen and few were a bit slimey. All seven didn't taste fresh at all. I had to douse it in their famous mustard dipping sauce & lemon. Not sure when and how often they get new shipments, but I suggest you call ahead of time to find out so you can eat them when they're relatively fresh.   The king crab louis salad was fresh, light, and tasted great. Only downside was that there were small pieces of shells in some bites. But my three stars goes to this dish.   Overall, I wouldn't discount this place. I've been here a couple times before and the food has been phenomenal. I unfortunately came on the wrong day for stone crab.",

The server was below average. He has not asked how my meal has been to this point. I would have let him know that my stone crab was sub par and seemed to have been in a fight with Mike Tyson. The shells were crushed so much that every bite was like chewing on gravel. At $60.00 I would have expected better. My filet was cooked very well but under seasoned.  The potatoes Loraine had a burnt taste to them. My wife skipped the onions on top and said they were good. So for $200.00 I got the same meal I could have at my local greasy spoon and pocketed $150.00. It's Vegas what do I expected. My wife commented that our bus boy has done more to serve us then our server. He seems to be busy with the larger table next to us. Want some potatoes with your grease?",

We ordered Joe's chopped salad,  the select stone crab, and the 24 oz bone-in ribeye cooked rare. The salad was really good, as they have bits of several different  elements in it. It was one of the best salads I ever had exploding with flavor in every bite. The stone crab was served cold. I normally don't like cold crab but this was an exception. It was unlike crab you get from a typical Buffet, as you could really taste the sweetness of the crab and the crab I usually eat at a buffet is normally heavily salted. The steak came to the table pre-cut and perfectly cooked and seasoned to show it's rare inside. The food was good and the bill reflected it as without tip it was $150.  The pictures were taken after we started eating.  The salad shown was half an order.  They also had a creamy sauce that tasted good with either the steak or the crab.",

    "text": "Fortunate to have visited the Miami landmark during a good season it wasn't until Friday that Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab was experienced here in Las Vegas, the 1913 building re-imagined inside Caesars Forum Shops bearing little resemblance to the original either in the heavily wooded main room or an upstairs space designed for private events.  No doubt targeting tourists and apparently doing well, the fact that Caesars' Joe's does not close during \"off season\" all the comment that is necessary regarding a focus on quantity over quality, it was after climbing stairs to a PDR already half-full with guests that sign-in took place, the prix-fixe menu not a bad collection though service was clearly of a \"get in and get out with the least interruption possible\" mindset.  Served in four courses with two offering a choice, Drink \"tickets\" handed out allowing for Domestic Beer or one of three budget Wines, it was with fairly good Prosecco that Appetizers were eaten, the Calamari pretty basic but thankfully not oily while overcooked Shrimp \"de Jonghe\" an basic stuffed Mushrooms both used plenty of Garlic and Breadcrumbs to help overcome their shortcomings in sourcing.   Offered Salad and Bread next, the latter highlighted by tender Corn Muffins that even warm could not melt pucks of icy Butter, it was with most Rolls inexplicably collected quickly that entrees arrived, the Crab Cakes thankfully all-Meat though not particularly memorable otherwise while Sashimi Grade Tuna atop fried Potatoes with convincing Bordelaise was certainly better and actually something worth seeking out in terms of taste and texture.  Rounding out the evening with Dessert, the effort to obtain Coffee deemed unjustified, it was from a fraction of Joe's Cakes and Pies that Key Lime and Banana Cream were selected, the former identical to its Miami counterpart but larger in portion while Bananas relied too much on sugary \"Foster Sauce\" for sweetness and fell far short of Emeril's version offered at MGM or The Venetian.  TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Probably not the ideal setting to experience Joe's Las Vegas outpost, though considering the sponsor's investment one would have at least expected gracious service, it seems as though this house of Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab prefers dollars to quality or execution and that is precisely why chains no matter how \"upscale\" are rarely worth visiting once one has already dined at the original.",

We even let her know we were going out after dinner and she even suggested plates that weren't too heavy! One of the girls ordered a soup and she wasn't too fond of it and our server was so nice to take it back.

Served cold, there'y really not much to this dish other than defrosting it and melting some butter. But king crab is tasty, and it was nicely split to make it easy to eat. Be careful though, I didn't specifically say I wanted the \"entree\" serving, and they upgraded to the \"cluster\" causing the bill to rise by $30 and creating more of a pile of crab than could reasonably eaten.   As a side, the Joe's Grilled Tomatoes really sucked, one bite was all I could stomach. They're slices of tomato topped with spinach and cheese. Big pass on these.   Lyonnaise potatoes were huge, the two of us barely scraped one corner off. They were reasonably tasty.   Service was professional and very fast. The oysters, for example, were clearly pre-shucked, though they'd not been sitting out very long.",

    "text": "Wow! This steak and seafood restaurant was such an amazing find.  The quality of their steak was fantastic and the service was equally great.  We had reservations but came in too early for their dining room to even open and the bar was fairly crowded so we decided to sit by their waiting area.  The staff were quite fantastic and treated everyone with respect.  It's a high-end restaurant and most people knew to dress up a bit but there were some in jeans and t-shirt but were treated nicely as far as I could tell.  Finally, when we were seated I ordered a glass of cabernet and my dining partner ordered a Moscow mule.  We skipped the appetizers because I really wanted their 25 oz bone-in ribeye. We shared 2 sides (huge sides and will definitely fill 2 people up and still have leftovers). I ordered my bone-in ribeye medium rare like I always do and they delivered! As if I wasn't already impressed! My steak was flavorful, tender, and juicy. Again... Wow! I wish there was a Joe's in my city.  My only regret is, I didn't take any photos because I didn't want to embarrass my dining partner with my photo-taking at a fancy place. I had dessert as well but everything else did not fair as well as the steak I had. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're in Vegas and are looking for a place with fantastic steaks.",

    "text": "The day has come where I finally tried out Joe's Seafood and their famous Stone Crab! We had a group of 6 people that came during the later lunch hours on a busy Memorial Day Weekend. Luckily, we were seated right away for a table for 6 in the bar area. The service was very good and attentive. The complimentary bread basket was also an unexpected treat.   // FOOD // Stone Crab: They have medium, select, and large sizes when it comes to the crab claws. We decided to go try out the select Stone Crabs. It came with 6 claws for $60. The Stone Crab wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be, but it was really good with the dipping sauce that it gets served with. Tasted like a mustard mayonnaise sauce. 3.5/5  Seared Sea Scallops: Sunchoke puree, pickled shallots. The scallops were large and cooked perfectly in the middle. I wish they had a harder sear on the outside, but it was still a really good scallop. The sunchoke puree was delicious, but the pickled shallots did not go well with the dish at all. It does provide the dish some color, but makes the scallops taste pretty bad so I just put the shallots off to the side. 4/5  BLT Wedge: Crispy pork belly, grape tomatoes, chopped egg, blue cheese, Joe's vinaigrette. I wish I could just order a plate of the cubed crispy pork belly! It was definitely the star of the salad. The rest of the salad was your standard wedge that you can find at many restaurants.   Overall, I was pretty satisfied with my experience at Joe's Seafood. Typically, when you wait so long to try a restaurant that you've been wanting to try it tends to fall short of your expectations, however, Joe's lived up to my expectations. I only wish the Stone Crabs were more flavorful, but the rest of the food was delicious! I will definitely be back again to try a couple of the other dishes on the menu that caught my eye.",

The crab roll was good but very bready vs it being about crab but did finish it. The chips were way too oily so left those back. The halibut fish stole the experience as it did taste fresh but had no real taste. The mashed peas here were not as good as Hell's Kitchen. Texture and taste off. That's a shame as I've cooked with halibut and it takes to seasoning very well. The breads here sucked. Most places we go like Bavette's the bread is out of this world but here we were disgusted with complimentary breads they put on our table but hey it's free so I digress. The desert was amazing. You have to get the key lime pie here. The pie simply was the best key lime pie I've ever had.",

Red flag number 2. The fact that I could not bring in my $14 cocktail was in itself inconvenient especially in a closed space such as Caesars Palace. I was piggy in the middle between one overpriced Caesars store complaining about another one and I'm not having it. I got cheapest food on the menu (burger) and that my way of telling this store to @uck off (corporate event or I would not have eaten here on principle). Will never come here again.",

They also had a crispy Brussels option, which was nice than your typical \"french fries/potatoes/carb\" options (which they still offered.

Upon arriving, we were warmly welcomed by several employees and were promptly seated.   The restaurant is beautiful and the valet parking is a plus - Especially since parking can be a mess when dining on the strip.   Our server Brad was absolutely ahhhhmazing. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, gave us really good suggestions and had a great personality.   We ordered the King Louis salad, Crag stuffed shrimp, King Crab Legs, sauteed spinach, roasted corn and wild sockeye salmon. Everything was surprisingly fresh! The King Crab tasted like it was snatched right out of the ocean, along with the salmon and shrimp. The servings aren't  \"skimpy\" either. Lol!! The shrimp was literally the size of my hand and cooked to perfection.   I highly recommend Joe's for ANY special occasion or if you're in the mood for THE BEST seafood in Vegas. Thanks for a superb experience!!!",

We basically ordered whatever our server told us to and I highly recommend everyone do the same. The people who work there know the menu inside and out and the bartenders are my kind of people.

Once you get past $30, the increase in taste is small but the cost is high. That said, I ordered the bone-in fillet and it was fantastic. I don't think it was anything remotely worth $55 but it was one of the better steaks that I've had at a restaurant. Personally, on my next trip I'll stick to the cheaper steaks as the low end fillet is half the cost with about 85% of the amount of deliciousness. But if you come to Joe's, expect to pay a lot for the high end steaks and forget about the costs because you'll enjoy the steak. The sides were varied - loved the calamari and potatoes but the mac and cheese was good but nothing special. Out of the desserts that I tasted, the turtle pie was OK but loved the tres leche cake.",

Lastly I closed out with a bone-in filet, the original they call it.  It was a thick piece of meat, so that meant the center was nice and rare, just the way I like it.

Ordered the following;  - The WHALE (Alaskan crab, Lobster tail, Jumbo shrimp, Shrimp & scallop ceviche) (fresh). - Crab cake (absolutely fantastic)! - Stone crab (Large) (this is a must!  juicy, sweet crab...What's not to love)!?  This place highly impressed me.  The only thing really lacking is the service.  Could use a little tweaking here and there but overall, fantastic place!  I will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "I wanted to surprise my husband for our anniversary and decide to take him here. When we checked in they couldn't find our reservation which scared me thinking our night is ruined already but they still honored our reservation and had us seated within minutes. Troy, our server, told us their special which was intimidating at first but he was very patient and gave us plenty of time.   We started our dinner with Crab Bisque which was warm and creamy. Then we had the seafood chopped salad it had good amount of shrimp, lobster and the king crab. The dressing was perfect and the greens were fresh and crunchy and with the cherry tomatoes it was so sweet. Hard to describe you just have to try it. For our course my husband had a filet mignon (medium) and I had the stone crabs and our sides were Jennie's mash potato, sweet grilled corn and grilled asparagus. Troy was great and recommended that we get our side as half instead of the full since there's only 2 of us sharing. The steak was soft and mouth watering seems like the meat just melts in your mouth. The stone crab is fresh because you can taste the sweet meat. And their sides so yummy. For our desert we had the key lime pie and the Havana dream pie. We liked the Havana better. It's hard to describe what a wonderful experience we had you just have to try it for yourself. Oh yeah and they gave us complimentary champaign for our anniversary. Love this place and will definitely come back!",

It will be pricey, but bear in mind you are fine dining in Vegas. The sides like the mash potatoes can easily be split between two people. We split the stone crab for appetizers. My recommendations Try the stone crab, what they're known for Crab bisque is the best you'll ever find (ask for extra crab meat) Steaks are massive, probably won't finish if you have an appetizer and been drinking for a while  PS IF you're new to Vegas, be prepared to walk long distances, I clocked our time from hotel room within Caesars at 28 minutes (0.6 miles). We were 5 minutes late and lost two of our guys. They won't let you sit down unless everyone's present!",

Ordered the whale appetizer, an order of the stone crab, and the crab legs. The stone crab, while yummy, was a lot of work for not a lot of meat. The rest, however, was awesome. The crab legs were quite simply the best I've ever had. I'm not normally a fan of cold seafood, but they were big, delicious, and easy to shell. The shrimp were huge and delicious as well. Heck, even the coffee was outstanding. I definitely recommend it.",

    "text": "Came here with Mom, and we shared the colossal lump crab cake appetizer, the stone crab bisque, and the seafood chop salad with creamy vinaigrette.  Everything was excellent.    The crab cakes are 95% crab chunks. And I mean chunks, none of those wimpy small pieces you get in normal crab cakes. The crabs they use must be huge! The meat was sweet and juicy, and the binding agent they use to hold it all together only added to the flavor. The cakes are roasted to a golden brown (not fried) and about the size of a tennis ball. One $16 serving comes with two cakes, making this an insanely good deal.  The crab bisque was very tasty and super rich, if a little salty. A small cup was $8, but it was so rich and filling that I could barely finish it.  The seafood salad comes with avocado, celery, asparagus, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, onions, and lobster, shrimp and crab meat. They were generous with the seafood,  and all the ingredients worked well together.  Service was excellent and the seating area is very pleasant.  The kitchen was nice enough to split both the crab cakes and the salad on two plates since we were sharing.  I will continue to return every time I'm in Vegas.",

My wife and I had our wedding reception here 5 years ago and celebrated by coming back for our anniversary (I also had it last month while here with friends for the NCAA tourney). Service is unbelievable, atmosphere and ambiance are unparalleled and of course the food is amazing. Steaks are off the charts (tonight's was possibly the best I've ever had, and I've been to plenty of Morton's, STK, Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, etc). Lobster was out of this world, bread was amazing, wedge salad awesome, wife loved the brussel sprouts. They also surprised us with a piece of key lime pie to help us celebrate and gave the kiddo a brownie sundae which she inhaled. I can't begin to describe how much I love Joe's, it really is the best.

To begin the service at this restaurant is the best in town. Very attentive but not overwhelming or hovering.  The food has to be the best seafood in town. Although there are meat dishes on the menu I have never had anything but seafood. We were there just yesterday for moms 91st birthday. Mom had a seafood pasta dish loaded with lobster crab and shrimp. I went for my favorite the grilled seafood platter. Lobster tails shrimp and scallops. And we split a huge sweet potato with praline butter. It was moms birthday so they brought out their brownie dessert with ice cream. And of course a candle.  The prices are high but worth every penny. Usually we go home with a to go box. Kudos also to our waiter Leno who made mom feel very special. Thanks for another great evening.",

To my surprise my friend Karen told me that there was one in Las Vegas.  So being the foodie that I am, I had to check it out.  Joe's decor is reminds me of a NYC steakhouse. Dark wood tables, chairs and floors.  The stone crabs are definitely the star in this place, hence the name.  The stone crabs come pre-cracked so the all the hard work is done for you.  The meat is sweat and very flavorful and pairing it with the honey mustard sauce is genius!  I had the scallops and the gf have the crab stuffed sole.  The scallops came out alone with a little green garnish and a little greasy.  For me, it was too plain.  I needed something to go along with the scallops, maybe a mixed green salad wtih balsamic vinegrette.  The crab stuffed sole was great, especially when dipped in the sauce.  The onion rings were good if you like them thin and stringy.  The mashed potatoes with the fontina cheese is to die for!  Granted were on a low-carb diet, but you have to try it.  You only live once!  As you can tell, we obviously weren't able to finish the meal so we brown-bagged it home.  What a night at Joe's!  I've been back many times and love their stone crab. I love this place!",

One row of tables stare at the waiter prep station, another at a blank wall.  The big issues is that you may not actually be able to get Stone Crabs here at Joe's Stone Crabs.  A combination of the oil spill in the gulf, a bad crab season and that the original Joe's in Miami (this isn't, its a distant partnership) hoardes the crabs means they may be out.  Their \"Steak and Stone Crabs\" (which is why I went) is on the menu but not being served.  The evening I was there they were out of every Stone Crab size EXCEPT the two most expensive ones so call ahead.  As a big Lettuce Entertain you fan (20 years now) I was surprised.  Food-wise the grilled corn, creamed spinach, and the key-lime pie were definite highlights and the good news is that NOT even BP or a poorly written service level agreement with the original Joe's Stone Crab can stop those from being available.",

What's not to love about eating with my hands and licking my fingers with my Love. Normally I order some claws, another appetizer and dessert. The latest dinner included the seafood chopped salad which was great. The seafood was fresh, perfectly cooked and chilled and abundant. Finished with my go to dessert, the peppermint gelato with hot fudge sauce. I would lick the bottom of the pitcher the sauce but that would be gauche. Until the next visit...I secretly dream of Joe's.",

I've never had stone crab before but it was succulent and buttery.  They provided a spicy honey mustard sauce to go along with the crab and it was such a great match to the sweetness of the crab!  The server made the coleslaw right at the table, fresh and it was quite good.  I opted for no hash browns as I had had hash browns the previous evening in my drunken state at Treasure Island.  Just the crab and coleslaw was enough to fill me but wasn't heavy at all.  If you're a dude, you have to get the hash browns to fill your tummy.  The key lime pie was tasty, quite chilled (frozen, I think) but good with fresh whipped cream.  All-in-all, it was a great lunch for $20.  I totally recommend it.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night in December, a party of 6.  We made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  It ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.  Decor: 4.5/5  Clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  We sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that I noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  The seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  Poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.  Service:  5/5 Service here was fantastic.  The waiters (I didn't see any waitresses) were all in Tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  Plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  Amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a Jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (Some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)  Surf: 4/5 I didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  The stone crab pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  The mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  I was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  I wouldn't feel the need to order that again.  Turf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the Petite Filet Mignon -- strangely I think only one of us finished it.  I guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  The meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  I think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  The fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)  Side Dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  Ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) The creamed spinach could have been entirely skipped.  It was flavorless.  2) The Mac n Cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  If you're in the mood for Mac N Cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  Then again I think I've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my Mac N Cheese now... 3.  Jennie's Mashed Potatoes.  The crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  It was strangely dry though.  My idea mashed potatoes have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  Worth ordering  4) The sweet corn was surprisingly great!  I usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  I think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.  Dessert 5/5: We ordered the Key Lime Pie.  All their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a Florida restaurant -- we decided on the Key Lime Pie.  It was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best Key Lime Pie I've ever had.  I finished most of the pie even though I couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person I am!).  The coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but I think starbucks is good so I wouldn't know.  Sorry!  Overall, it was a great meal.  If I went back to Vegas I'd probably want to try a different restaurant but I certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  The meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine).   I'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  Apparently, you can get Joe's delivered to your house.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to finally trying Joe's Stone Crab. I have seen on it TV shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought I was going to be in for a treat. Unfortunately I was sadly mistaken. I went with the big crab legs and we had the creamed spinach, pan roasted sweet corn, mashed potatoes, lyonnaise with some oysters on the half shell. The oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the stone crab was a flop. Now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case I will research and try them again when they are in season. What will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. We had two tables with a total of 15 people. For the two tables we were given one waitress who was VERY slow. Forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. Overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. My company is in Vegas twice a year and I was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.",

Gigantic portions, interesting & chatty waiters (ours was a chivalrous, old-school, Sinatra-type who provided impeccable service, dahlink).

Bone-in Dry Aged Rib Eye  If you don't order a steak, then you are missing out on something I can't quite describe. Life changing? Emotionally fulfilling? Scrumptious? Yeppers.  It was cooked to exactly medium rare. I think this is has to be the best cut there too.   Rock Crab It was great. To be honest, I'm not sure if I've ever had bad crab. We got the jumbo 3 piece to share, which was a good option to taste without fully committing your entree to seafood.  For sides, we had broccolini and lyonnaise. Nothing special with the broccolini, and the lyonnaise was better than I expected. We had so much other food, so we left most of these sides behind.  Malbec recommended if your informed enough to order a steak.",

Nuances that were so compatible, subtle, but dynamic~ They don't pan sear them like most I think, Seems they put this scoop on a broiler plate under the salamander, and gave the out side little bits of caramelization~ And I couldn't discern any filler at all!  Just Jumbo lump crab, maybe some mayo to hold it together, and seasoned perfectly~You'll have to forgive me... It was an experience I definitely have to do again soon~ As for the Claws, I Usually get the \"Select\" size~ Just amazing~ (And they did a better job than usual cracking the shells~ Just Awesome! And I don't think I have to add the service is always excellent when I go~ Even if something isn't perfect, they will take full responsibility and ownership, no matter what the problem was~ Just to pay them the compliments they deserve!",

    "text": "I hate giving this restaurant a poor review, but I feel like it's justified, as my overall expectations were not met.   I went to Joe's this past weekend to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  She loves crab, so I thought the perfect restaurant would be Joe's Stone Crab. Neither of us have ever had stone crabs before.  We had a 9PM reservation on Saturday night. After ordering, the waiter came back and informed us that they had run out of stone crabs. At first I thought he was joking, but then I realized he was completely serious.  I was initially shocked and then thoroughly disappointed that the special plans I made were now ruined.  So we canceled the stone crabs we had ordered, and the stone crabs that were in the \"Whale\" appetizer were substituted with a small piece of Alaskan King Crab (I felt they could have done a lot more than that).  Is a 9PM dinner in Las Vegas on a Saturday night really that late of a dinner - should I have anticipated this shortage? I don't think I should have. Let this be a warning to all that come for the claws - come early or else!  I understand that the logistics of flying in a perishable product fresh every day. I do get that - I'm a rational/logical person. It doesn't change the fact that I was initially very upset, which just turned into major disappointment on this special occasion.  I mean, it's called \"Joe's Stone Crab\".  It's in the freaking name!  How can you run out of the very product you're named after? (That's a tongue in cheek, rhetorical question by the way - I've already acknowledged understanding the logistics.)  For what it's worth, the food and service were good. Although my lobster was a bit dry on the edges (especially given the price), the sides and dessert were very good. The other food that I had sampled (NY Strip) was good as well, but if you can't cook a steak properly in Vegas, you may just as well shut your doors.  My friends all enjoyed their food and drink (although since I was footing the bill, they wouldn't have said otherwise so, who knows!). The highlights were the loaded roasted corn (excellent), hashbrowns, and the peanut butter pie (skip the banana cream pie).  They were nice enough to bring my girlfriend a dessert at the end for her birthday (although this was after we had ordered two desserts to share among five of us). I guess it was a nice gesture, but why didn't they offer that before we ordered dessert? We just took it with us, and it wasn't very good the next day.  The service was friendly and unobtrusive.  The waiter deterred us from getting two different versions of the hashbrowns as they portions are very large, and we were very glad he did. The restaurant added an automatic gratuity of 18% for our table of five, which I'm glad the waiter pointed out to me. I found this a little odd, because I think in the long run, automatic gratuity for small parties doesn't favor the waitstaff. I typically tip about 20% on the pre-tax subtotal because it's easy to calculate, so I wasn't taken back by it either.  I feel like I could have had the same steak and lobster type dinner at one of two dozen restaurants in Vegas, without the long walk through the Caesar's mall (ten-fifteen minute walk from taxi to restaurant) and the bitter disappointment at the beginning of the meal.  Would I have gone to this restaurant knowing they didn't have Stone Crabs? Certainly not.  Will I attempt to dine there again in the future?  Probably not at that location. I will wait until I make it to Miami so I can have reasonable assurance they will not run out of stone crabs.",

It was very disappointing.   It lacked the ambiance of old school elegance that Joe's portrays in Miami, the decor was similar but the service was not. Although good the Vegas servers did not carry off the spirit of \"old school\" as expected. The worse part was the stone crabs, why we where there. They where not great. Not really bad but not up to the Joe's name.  All in all the meal and experience where not worth it. If you are a Joe's Miami fan you will not be happy.  Finally this is not a value for the money and it is not hard to do much better in Vegas.",

The food is amazing, bone-in filet, the different types of oysters, the fresh cold seafood platter, all to die for and I would definetely return for those items, but its hit or miss with service and staff, if they \"know\" you meaning you come often and tip well, I notice you get the best of the best service and interaction, but I've eaten there on other occasions and its clear that the servers treat you differently based on their initial impression of you and how you'll tip. Prime example, eating there with a frequent diner and the female server suggests we get a platter of each type of oyster raving about where they're from and why she loves them each differently, but that same server at our large company party sadly suggested we stick to one type, I want to say Maryland and gave a look of disgust towards some of the others on the menu, it was disappointing because I told guests how amazing they were and then it was a total let down.",

The waitstaff is in tuxedos and the decor is really nice. The service is top notch and the waitstaff was very knowledgable about the menu and all of our waiters recommendations were spot one.  I had a Caesar salad and the grilled seafood platter. The table had some of the cracked crab as an appetizer. The crab is served cold with s mustard sauce for dipping so it's better as an appetizer than an entree in my opinion.  The seafood platter consisted of lobster tail, shrimp snd bay scallops and they were grilled perfectly.  The table shared a few sides; asparagus and potatoes and they were excellent as well.  I had to try the Key Lime pie for dessert and it was as advertised. A couple in our party had the banana cream pie and said it was amazing. Stellar meal all the way around!! Joe's is all they say they are.",

Crabs at Joe's are to die for...and so are their bone-in steaks. I got the bone-in filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly and super tasty. OH don't forget about their potato dishes! I am not a big fan of potato but I just can't get my fork off the plate! And I don't mean ordinary potato dishes like baked potato or mashed potato, try Lyonnaise Potato or Jennie's potato! And considering how big the portions are with great flavors, it definitely worth every penny. One thing about the clam chowder though...is that it's not the white-creamy chowder that you get, it was more like...borshch-tomato style soup. Besides that, everything else was perfect and I will definitely go back again when I visit Vegas next time!",

Their service has always been great and the restaurant is a little brighter (ie less romatic) so it's great for casual dining.  They also have a seating area that extends out the front into the forum shops so you can people watch if you want.  Crab claws are basically what they are known for but what makes me want to go back is the beef.  I always get a NY strip and it's always done to perfection.  Sides are great and perfect for sharing.  French fried sweets, roasted sweet corn, asparagus, it's all very tasty.    Their banana cream pie is also a winner.    The thing that sets this place above others though is the seasoning mix they give you to put on your steak.  It is quite simply the perfect blend of seasonings that bring out the flavor of your steak.  5 Stars!!",

    "text": "HORRIBLE FROZEN STONE CRAB. The main reason why people come to Joe's is the stone crab which is phenomenal when super fresh. When I got my order of stone crab claws last week, they were horrible and not fresh.  Basically it was a plate of 5 stone crab claws that had been frozen and thawed. They were still rather cold, there was no seasoning or special preparation except for a side of their mustard dip, and it purely sucked. SO FREAKIN DISAPPOINTING. Joe's should know better than to offer stone crab when the stone crab is out of season and serve it thawed from the freezer and still charge so much. 0 STARS FOR THE FROZEN STONE CRAB. There's a reason why Joe's Stone Crab in Miami used to shut down for months when stone crab was not in season. I believe the waiter should have at least warned us how much they suck frozen.  Luckily, the rest of the food was decent - the salad with seafood was good and had nice portion of shrimps, crab, and other seafood. However, I would have preferred the dressing to be less creamy and for it to be a lighter salad. The cole slaw was average. The key lime pie was pretty good but not as good the stuff you get from Joe's Miami.  Service was attentive and professional.  Bottom line: Thawed frozen stone crab claws = YUCK. Wait until stone crab is back in season. Rest of the food is decent with good service but there are better seafood places.",

First off the crab claws are awesome and meaty and the serve them with a creamy spicy mustard sauce and it all works real good.   Ok now the reason I gave this place 5 stars is because they serve the best steak I have ever had (three times), it is there signature cut 16oz aged bone in prime filet. I mean big, super tender, and a great aged flavor. Being bone in it is more flavorful than others. Their sides are all the standards but all are excellent and of course plenty big enought to share.   By todays strip standards this place has pretty good prices.  Sides are between 5 and 8 bucks and the signature bone in steaks between 42 and 49  so all considered this place is about as reasonable as a steak house gets nowadays.  They have a selection of regular steaks for under 40 plus other chops, chicken, and seafood I have never tried.  This is not some hoity toity steak house that serves duck fat fries or tuna tartare taco appetizers, this is a great traditional classic American steak house.   They have some 24 dollar steak or crab lunch specials that are worth checking out, I did and it was real good.    We went to the one in Chicago and it was too excelent.",

    "text": "Fantastic establishment.  Start your meal with their stone crab claws. They're the best. Melt in your mouth, butter texture with great flavor. The sauce they serve it with is also excellent.  Now entrees. Chilean Sea Bass with a miso glaze. SO GOOD. Cooked perfectly to the point where the sauce caramelizes on the fish. Fish texture is great as well.  Dry aged bone-in rib-eye. Pretty bomb piece of steak. I'd say it is my second favorite next to Nick and Stef's. Comes with a dry seasoning composed of salt, pepper, garlic, and corriander.   Filet Mignon. I'd stay away from this one. Wasn't that great in my opinion.  FINISH YOUR MEAL with the Boston Cream Pie. It is SO GOOD. Take my word for it, the main reason I came back was not the crab claws... it was this slice of heaven. Try it. Love it. Thank me. You're welcome.",

My father's medium rib eye steak was tough, did not have a good flavor and was served blood red rare.  My lobster tail was both mushy and stringy.  Very, very disappointed.

I took the 5pm and we were seated right away in a large comfy booth.  Promptly greeted and ordered drinks.  I ordered a Cosmopolitan. Not overly sweet.  In fact, I switched to Riesling when we ordered.  We split the salad: CHOPPED LETTUCE, TOMATO, ONION & BLEU CHEESE- $12 .95 *Good. Nothing special. I think this was a wedge? STONE CRABS *My first time having stone crabs.  Delicious and full of flavor.  They serve it with a mustard dipping sauce that is creamy and perfect with the crab. KING CRAB LEGS *Fell right out of the shell. Served with melted butter. Again, full of flavor and perfect!  I almost ordered scallops but our server advised us to their crab and I'm so glad they did!  We were not rushed after dinner and ordered a few more drinks before making our way to the bar.  Hopefully next time I will save room for dessert!",

    "text": "I've passed by Joe's plenty of times on my many expeditions through the Forum Shops.  It wasn't until I saw a segment on the Travel Channel about stone crabs that I took interest in the restaurant.  When stone crabs are caught, one claw is torn off and the crab thrown back in the ocean.  It's mean but stone crabs have the ability to grow back their claw in about 12 to 24 months.  Three friends and I dined here on a Saturday night at 7pm for our friend's birthday.  The restaurant is more than what meets the eye, there's also a back room with a good amount of seating.  I'm not sure if it's for reservations only but making reservations is always suggested.  APPETIZERS: *Oysters Rockefeller (4 pieces/order) - Okay.  Though the oyster shells were good size, the oysters were small and the creamy mixture overpowered the dish. *Stone Crabs - You can't dine here and NOT order the crabs.  I though the crabs were delicious.  They were a bit on the sweet side and tasted perfect with the accompanied special mustard sauce.  The only downer was that it seemed the claws were cracked too much making it tougher to eat trying to pick out the tiny shells.  Do note: stone crabs are more expensive than your normal crab and will cost up to $10/claw depending on how you order (you can order medium, large, or select). *BLT Wedge Salad - Good, but bacon makes everything taste better.  Our waiter was nice enough to split the salads so it could end up on each side of the table to be shared.  The salad consisted of blue cheese, onions, tomatoes, bacon, and topped off with a vinaigrette dressing.   ENTREE: *Veal Cutlets \"Oscar Style\" - Pass, I should've stuck to seafood.  The dish was comprised of two small veal cutlets which were breaded and fried, then sprinkled with crabmeat and chopped asparagus, and then doused with a hollandaise sauce.  The main reason this dish failed with me was the overcooked veal cutlets.  The crabmeat was deliciously sweet and the hollandaise sauce helped with the dryness of the veal.    SIDES: *Garlic Creamed Spinach - Delicious!  The dish was creamy and full of flavor.  I thought the garlic would be chopped into the spinach, but garlic cloves were cooked on top of the dish.   *Sugar Snap Peas - Good and extremely fresh.  The peas were had a nice sweet crisp to them.  SERVICE: Good and extremely professional.",

Actually, I can't remember if they were prepared to recipe, but they were both delicious.  Also, I like the ambiance of the place.  It feels like an east coast or chicago type place; Even though it's in a busy mall, it feels more like an independent restaurant.",

Our server Laura was AMAZING, she had great recommendations accommodated some special requests and truly engaged us in the experience setting up jokes for us and finishing jokes we pitched to her.   We had an order of stone crab claws and king crab legs for the table to share. Call me crazy but I didn't see what all the fuss is about the stone crab. In our collective opinion the king crab legs were far more delectable than the stone crab. The stone crab was ok, just not as good as the king crab.  I had the seafood feast grilled (I hate ruining good seafood with breading) which was really good. Upon Laura's recommendation we had the sweet corn and several other sides. The mushrooms and sweet corn were the best sides in my opinion. And just in case you are afraid of the sweet in sweet corn, the corn itself is sweet but it is grilled and seasoned so you get a perfect balance of sweet and savory. Others at the table ordered the rib eye and a filet, both of which looked like perfectly cooked pieces of meat, and both men reported that his steak was among the best he had ever eaten in his life.  This is an expensive meal but the service and the quality of food here justify the price. Come prepared for a luxurious dining experience!",

It's my ultimate comfort food. The batter was a bit to thick for my liking but the fish was fresh.    Grilled chicken club-pretty standard, but the chicken was moist and flavored well.   Beet salad-Yet another thing I'm currently obsessed with. I highly recommend it!  The food was good but definitely not worthy of 5 stars. So, why did I post them? The service was outstanding!  Let me set the scene...  Our server brought us another round of drinks halfway through our meal. As the server lifted the glass, about to put it on the table, I notice a rush of liquid coming from the bottom of the glass dousing my mom's purse and her leg in soda. The staff at Joe's moved quickly. Before I knew it, there were five servers around us, mopping and cleaning off the table and bringing us towels to wipe off. My mother has a sense of humor and what's a bit of soda? No biggie. We just wanted to finish our meal. Our server was apologetic and there wasn't really a need. Accidents happen. Then the GM came out and offered us a personal apology, then came the chef. Incredible! They offered a complimentary dessert which wasn't necessary but appreciated. I expected a slice of key lime pie but they brought out not only the key lime pie, but the bananas fosters a delicious chocolate packed cake that was heaven! With the care they took with us, I'll definitely come back anytime I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Since posting my initial review I was able to meet the Manager and he was understanding enough to offer me reimbursement for the bill and the tip.  He did offer us a dining coupon for a future visit but I declined as I most likely will not be back in Vegas for a long while. I changed this review to reflect the consideration I was given upon my return to the establishment and meeting with management.  Eat at Joe's !?  I think not.  This is one of those \"upscale dining establishments\" that prepares good food at ridiculously high prices. A tourist trap in one respect, a \"posh and trendy\" destination where locals who have more money than brains desperately desire to be noticed. We were visiting Las Vegas to see some good friends and offered to take them to dinner. My wife saw this restaurant online, and being impressed by the vast amount of multi-starred reviews, booked a table for that evening. Okay, so we were seated 1/2 hour after the reservation time, which can happen. As I said earlier, the food was good. Unfortunately, it was also tainted. I had the crab bisque which I shared with my wife. All of us at the table enjoyed our meals. I knew it was going to be a bit expensive, but honestly, the food wasn't THAT good. And when the waitress came with our check she announced that she had already included an 18 % tip to our bill, saying \"All the other waiters do it and it was expected.\"  Excuse me? As the patron, shouldn't I be the person who dictates what the tip should be? It was bad enough the meals were overpriced, but to be told BY THE WAITRESS what to tip is downright rude and out of place!  Now for the worst part- later that night, at about 2 AM, I start to feel pain in my stomach. \"Too much \"good\" food\" I thought. But the pain continued, and increased to the point that I was throwing up my meal. And then my wife also was throwing up her meal during the early morning hours. This may not have been the most memorable night I have spent in Las Vegas- just one of the worst.   The next morning my wife calls the restaurant and the manager tells her we should visit a doctor. I can barely get out of bed and my wife thinks we are going to die from food poisoning. Our hotel sends an EMT to check us out, finds we are still breathing, and leaves us with an address to a clinic that can't be found via Mapquest or GPS.  Wife and I huddle in our hotel room for the remainder of the last day of our vacation and the stomach cramps, vomiting, and nausea eventually subside. What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.",

The service is very good, the stone crab appetizer is nice, I'm more of a Dungeness guy myself, but it seemed fresh, interesting mustard sauce served with it, not real enthused about that one.  My meal was decent, a seafood chop salad.  In all, not somewhere I would rave about or tell anyone it's a must.  There's a place about 50 feet away that has a great rawbar, good seafood, less crowds and a better vibe.  I'll review that place later!",

Tried the stone crab and it was good, but for me it was not as flavorful as king crab.  Maybe it was because I had the medium claws.  The mustard sauce made the meal.  Also had the seafood chopped salad and the seabass, both of which were very good.  All in all I had a nice time at the restaurant and  would go back.",

It's just great and more affordable for the food and experience you get than some of the other pricier seafood and steak places on the strip - still not cheap but not overpriced.  I used opentable both times and this time the host - four years later - was super friendly with the welcome back greetings and gave us a great table.  The waitstaff are fabulous and very professional and friendly without being overbearing.  I ordered the filet Oscar and my boyfriend ordered the grilled seafood platter.  The steak was a perfect medium rare and came with huge chunks of delicious crab and asparagus.  I was asked if I wanted the bernaise drizzled over everything which I thought was nice and of course I did!  My boyfriend loved his seafood as well and the scallops were impeccable.  We split the key lime pie for dessert and it was incredible.  We were stuffed and needed the walk back to our hotel and then some.  I debated on coming back here or trying something new but we were glad we went back to Joes because it did not disappoint.",

Everything else Joe's does is simply average - there are better restaurants for steak, for chicken, or even for chicken, bar food and the like in Vegas.

We started with a crab cake appetizer which was full of crab meat delicately seasoned. 2 of us ordered the Joe's lunch special for $24.95 which included a 6oz filet, grilled tomato topped with creamed spinach, Jennie's potatoes and desert.  What a great deal that was. The other person in our party ordered the fish & chips (with sweet potato chips) and a side dish of macaroni & cheese. The fish was very good with a light batter. He did not care for the sweet potato chips they were a little greasy and cold. The macaroni & cheese was hot and delicious. For desert we had the banana cream pie, tres leeches cake and the brownie sundae topped with ice cream. The banana cream pie and the tres leeches cake were both something we will have again. Our waitress was very helpful picking out wine and checked back frequently to see if we needed anything. Service was great and the food was great-  We will definitely be back and will ask for Hope. Lunch is very casual, we all wore jeans and nice shirts-there were people eating in shorts. Dinner is much more formal and expensive.",

This is by far one of the best meals I have ever had and was probably the best meal we ate in Vegas during our stay. Our server (I forget her name) was fantastic! Super friendly and professional, made suggestions when appropriate but wasn't overly pushy. We started our meal off with the calamari to start which was great. For entrees I had the 8oz filet mignon and my boyfriend had the crab stuffed shrimp. He initially was not sure about whether or not to get the crab stuffed shrimp or the grilled seafood platter but our server recommended the crab stuffed shrimp and I am glad he followed her recommendation because they were delicious! For our side we had Jennie's mashed potatoes which were also great. Food was amazing, well cooked and well presented and very flavourful. Service was professional and on point. Will definitely recommend to others and will definitely return next time we are back. Highlight of the night was our server bringing us out a complimentary brownie dessert for celebrating our anniversary which was so thoughtful and appreciated! Dinner for two with drinks was around $115 which was not bad at all given the high quality in both food and service.",

    "text": "Ehh....  Quite overrated for what it is, a mall restaurant in an upscale mall. I'm not big into Stone Crab to begin with, but it was OK... They pre cracked them well so that was a plus (not too many shell injuries), but the mustardy-sauce for dipping was bland and tasted like Hellman's Dijonaise. There's not a ton of meat on the stone crab claw, and i personally don't see what all the hype is about.   Perhaps it stems from the fact that when stone crabs are harvested, they just rip their arm off and throw it back to live on in the sea and re-generate another one in time. I suppose that makes it less cruel (Though I don't agree, sounds like virtual hell to me).  I didn't eat the steak though the fillet looked decent. I got Crab cakes and they were mediocre at best.  Biggest disappointment, when eating a $300 dinner for 3 (with a mediocre 4X markup wine), I don't like sitting at high-rise bar tables, even if they are disguised with a white table cloth and a napkin ring.   If you need Stone Crab, try Del Frisco's instead! It's not a far cab-ride from Caesars, and the stone crab (which is not their specialty) comes with a WAY better version of the mustard sauce. Plus it's way classier for your money and not much if at all pricier.",

    "text": "Joes is old-timey. It's an old warhorse of Vegas, and well....it might not be at the top trend of 'look how cool we are' but it still kicks ass when it comes to delivering a meal. I've only been once and that night was with my family and a few family friends. We'd started at the bar drinking and had spent the entire day drinking and continued drinking...so there might be a bit of a memory lapse here...because we ended up drinking at Casa Fuente right after too.   Joe's is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas thus far, and absolutely one of my favorite steakhouses I've ever been too (I'd say second favorite behind a Kansas City place). We did just about everything off the menu. Everyone save for myself got crab appetizers (I don't do seafood)   By then, I'd had a few scotches in me and we were opening up the wine. This was a big trip for everyone; trade show for me, trade show for dad, youngest brother just turned 21. We'd been planning on this trip for over a year as it was the first time all of us had been together since last Thanksgiving.   Joe's is the go-to place for many in workspace my dad is in; they've been going here for close to 20 years. Hilariously enough everyone in the industry basically was there, either eating on the 'exterior' area or in the actual restaurant. I'd wager some of the staff probably got to see really expensive knives :/. I was in town for SHOT, so I was exhausted as hell.   This place basically propelled what was an amazing trip into one of the best family vacations any of us had been on, and that's including trips to the Caribbean and the EU. Why, you ask?   Service put up with us because half of us were well-dressed inebriated mid-20-something kids hanging during trade show season on a Saturday night. Our server, who's name I do forget, was fantastic and she did her job well. Right up there with what you expect for this town, if not more.   The steak is the best steak in Vegas I've had thus far. Sure, haven't been to Robuchon or Delmonico...but hearing anecdotal stories from family/friends most everyone continues to talk up Joe's. Every single male at our table ordered the NY Strip because that's how you do a damn steakhouse. We ordered about every potato option I think, and most of the veggies.   Nothing made it out alive. I seriously watched my brother cry happily in the corner as we were all having a meal none of us were going to forget. Mind you, we're from KC and we eat out a lot....we've had it nice and it's hard to impress every member of my family. This place was nothing new to the older crowd, who were all having their favorite steak in Vegas already, but my two brothers and I were having an experience.   Basically; Joe's definitely is one of the best steaks in the country.   Going to Casa Fuente afterwards and then to some electronica concert at the MGM made this one of the best nights ever.   10/10 will eat at drunkenly again after playing with guns and knives and stuff all day.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on a Monday evening. Walked up at 7pm and it was a 2 hour wait for the \"restaurant\" section, and was advised to try the \"bar/casual\" area.... where we were sat immediately. Same menu... Same food....No wait.  Happy to see that you can get a sandwich or salad... not just steak or crab. And... they had steaks starting at $25.... which on the strip is pretty hard to do at a nice restaurant.  So, this was a happy surprise.    Started with Bread... good bread too.  :)  Then we tarted with stone crab as an appetizer.  I was surprised at how sweet these were.  They serve it with a cream dipping sauce which is totally not needed as the crab is good on its own.  I had Bacon wrapped Scallops for dinner.  Something about bacon and scallops.... a great combo.  The scallops were tender and grilled nicely.  The husband had the special Stripe Bass which was moist and flavorful, and topped with yummy mushrooms.  Our friends each had a steak cooked perfectly to their order.  They looked really good and they both said they were really good.  For sides, we got the Mac n Cheese, Potatoes Lyonnaisse, Mashed Potatoes, Broccolini. The Mac n Cheese was more creamy than cheesy. I like the Potatoes Lyonnaisse better than the Mashed.... the Lyon one came with carmelized onions on top of cubed, hash brown like potatoes. Broccolini was nice and crunchy which is how I like my veggies so this was perfect for me.  Service was good... our water glasses were refilled regularly. Sitting in the bar area was nice since you got to people watch or watch a game on one of their TVs.  For 4 people... plus a bottle of wine, our total before tip was $295.  In Vegas, on the strip... for a nice steak/seafood dinner..to me that is reasonable.  I may be jaded but I like to eat out and try different places so I'm glad we went here.  (Note, this is not.... IMO... the best steak place but this is a really solid steak / seafood restaurant.  Would be a really good place for business lunch or people wanting a nice dinner but may be a bit price sensitive.)",

    "text": "I have to admit, the key lime pie ($6.95) was terrific.  But the seafood, which I thought was their specialty, was just so so.  The scallops ($24.95) tasted kind of dirty.  And the stone crab ($42.95) was nothing special.  I'm not a big fan of their mushroom sauce, so maybe that has something to do with it.  If I go again, I'm going to try to get some good, old melted butter.  We also tried the vegetable chopped salad ($13.95), which was a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but chock full of vegetables and pretty tasty.  The pretzel bread was pretty good, but cold.  :(  Keep in mind, about half the tables are high-top so you may have to sit at one of those.  Also, they could use some dual service technique or something.  We did have a guy come down and randomly wipe down our table at odd intervals, but he didn't seem interested in helping with anything else.  So our only waitress was occupied and we had to wait longer than we wanted to order dessert and get the check.  All in all, just A-OK.",

    "text": "NYE specials out of this world! Best steak in the universe. ===  So we're wandering the endless halls of Caesar's looking for a spot to chill for several hours before the countdown begins. The halls are a bustle of screaming children and many people. The host stand and its tailored dude greet you alongside the display menu and a few tables out in the mall for the noisy customers. The real restaurant is back two rooms behind the bar and is like a secret treasure room for the deserving. We were lucky!  The NYE special surf and turf themed card included jumbo stone crab claws (4), king crab legs, 3lb lobster and a \"side\" of 8oz filet mignon. I won't say which one I didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the stone crab claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. Add to that a special price on the Tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.  The bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and Parmesean lahvosh. Stuffed mushrooms were excellent.  The service was prompt and professional and I loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun. The menu tells the story of the restaurant, founded in Florida, and I remember it well; this location honors the original in proper Vegas style.",

It is definitely going to be on my to-do list whenever I visit Las Vegas.  To start off, it's fancy. Don't show up in random clothes. The staff is formal, proper, polite, and extremely informative. They all know what they're talking about and help in every way. I would recommend this place to everyone, however, it's not cheap. You definitely pay for what you get! A good meal, at a good spot, with some great company. Make a reservation, save some time since they can get swamped with people. I ate here on my birthday and they even threw in some dessert no charge!  At this place, I've had many things but only listing what I can remember:  Bread: They serve bread once you sit. DON'T over-stuff yourself with it. I know it's beyond yummy but save your appetite, it gets better!  New England Clam Chowder: I'm not a fan of seafood whatsoever but I don't think this was bad. My bf loves this and orders it all the time. It's a nice portion and fulfilling.   Caesar Salad: By far one of the best salads I've had. They split it to share if you ask and it's extremely light. The dressing isn't over-powering which I love, and they never drench it either.   Crab Claws: Personally, I don't like them but that's only cause I don't like seafood too much. Once again, my bf LOVES them. They come with lemon to add onto them and bring you everything you need to eat them. I love how they bring out hot towels once you're done to clean your hands with. Big plus!  Filet Mignon: Ordered a Medium piece of meat. Wow! SOO good and they cooked it just the way I like it. It wasn't dry at all, very similar to Medium rare, without all the blood oozing out.  Mashed Potatoes: OMG! This is to die for! I ordered a half order, the portion is quite large with the rest of my meal. They layer them with cheese which gives it a little extra umph!  Parmesan Crusted Halibut: WIN! I LOVE this dish, everyone should try it. The crisp in each bite is to die for. My favorite thing to get!  I never know the name, but ladies, if you want some alcohol without it being overpowering and overwhelming, try ordering one of their special martini drinks. I always tell the server that I want their \"special peach martini..but I can't think of the name\" and they ALWAYS know what I'm talking about. The rim is covered in sugar and it is beyond refreshing and tasty. You can't even tell there's alcohol in there... based on the taste! I always get two when I eat here!  I cannot wait to visit this place again. It's a must if you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "The BEST filet mignon EVER!   This is it folks! When you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at Joe's. I generally do not order filet mignon because they always seem to lack flavor. Delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet. Thank God for Joe's that a sista can finally enjoy a figure friendly cut of steak that is out of this world. I ordered the lunch special and for $21.99 here's whatcha girl got:   Petite Filet - Awesome!   Jenny's Potatoes - Not the greatest. I would never order this again. The hashed brown potatoes didn't look any better. They looked like an over-sized overcooked baked potato.   Grilled Tomato - Phenomenal. Never had anything like this I'm my life. One slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it.   Two Crab Claws - My awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that I at least experienced the famous crab claws. He was honest about stating they were not in season. They were a bit frozen, but still okay. I was glad I didn't order them as my main course.   Key Lime Pie - The Bomb! The lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up.   The service here is the BEST. Everyone is there to ensure you leave extremely happy. My server went as far as to squeeze lemon juice over my hands prior to handing me a hot towel...OMG!!!   Overall, this place was outstanding!. I would highly recommend.",

I have never seen a green veg like asparagus fried so well. Desert was peanut butter pie and Havana cake. Both unreal. I suggest 1/2 pieces so you can try more than one. Great food.

I have been to Joe's numerous times, special dates, birthdays, girls day out, or just to have some really tasty food!   Food pros: The food is delicious, fresh, perfectly prepared, hot, and filled with flavor every time! I love going during lunch for their specials. Entree, two sides and dessert! What more could you ask for? I am OBSESSED with their roasted corn side dish. It is my favorite thing on the menu. I have to have it every time I go. The lyonnaise potatoes are also at the top of my list for sides. Crispy hot potatoes with sweet savory caramelized onions on the bottom, yummmmyy!! Their crab legs are always amazing and fresh. I appreciate them being cut already. The dipping sauce is tasty and a perfect compliment. Their filet mignon is bursting with True beef flavor and always a perfect medium rare. They have the best bread bowl. The pretzel bread is my fave. I know they have a huge menu, but I always come back for the same amazing dishes every time.   Food cons: None!   Service: The service is beyond impeccable each and every time! I don't know if they have a special training just for their servers but you can't find better service anywhere. I wish I could remember his name, possibly matt or mark. But he was the best server I've had in my dining experiences at any restaurant. Fast but not too fast, attentive but not overbearing, professional but fun, and extremely accommodating. My mom and I love the pretzel bread in the bread bowl. We asked if we could have more. So he brought back another bread bowl filled with just pretzel bread! Plus a yummy mustard sauce.   I will continue to dine at Joe's as long as I live in Las Vegas. It will be the first place I recommend to friends in town and the first place I take anyone for a delicious meal. My friend is trying to overcome her shellfish allergy. When she is cleared by her doctor I am taking her here to celebrate!",

My boyfriend got the peanut butter pie and one slice could have feed a small family.  Back to why you're probably interested in Joe's, the seafood. The Stone Crab is always cold and fresh and the mustard dipping sauce it on point. But do be warned that if you make a late reservation they can and do run out of it. The rest of the menu like King crab legs, seafood platters, steaks and salads are pretty solid offerings as well. Last time I had the Filet oscar- steak topped with crab- and it was delicious.  I find the prices to be very fair for the strip but not overly inflated like most strip steakhouses. If you're solo, there is a great bar area where you can dine and Stephanie makes some amazing cocktails at the bar.",

This guy knows the menu, the wines, and the local scene inside and out. Balancing super-friendly with professional, we really couldn't have asked for better service! He made our evening very special.  The food was amazing - every bite.   We started with Oysters (perfect) and Stone Crab Claws (super tasty, if a little messy).   For an entree, we split the Dover Sole - and let me tell you, there is no better fish when it is done right. This was done better than right. De-boned at the table (bar), and served with a very light butter sauce, I ate as slowly as I could, so as to enjoy every bite. With a side of the roasted cauliflower (which we also dipped in the sauce) it was a perfect dinner for two.   But we didn't stop there.  For desert, he had the Banana Cream Pie, which was surprisingly *not* overly sweet; just creamy and delicious with a glass of Tawny Port. I had the Marscapone pie, which was perfect with my Compass Box Scotch.  I've eaten in a lot of *fancy* restaurants that didn't have the fantastic food and service that we received here. This was worth every penny. Five Very Strong Stars!",

Just don't be on a budget and trust your servers!   Last trips: this review is based off our last 2 visits. We just had a trip here on July 12 (John was our awesome server!) and the previous trip was with Susanne (again, another best server)   Food: everything is fantastic and that is not an exaggeration. We've been to some of the finest restaurants around the world (at least for us lol), and this place is top notch!   Our favorites?: STONE CRABS (although the meat was a little harder to get out of shells at times...), Bone-in Rib-eye , Chilean sea bass, AND the 1.5 pounds (yes 1.5 pounds gets you bigger chunks of crab meat... seriously)!  Service: come for the food and stay because of the service. This was our 4th trip to Joe's in the past 2 years and cannot wait for our 5th. From the moment a person walks in, they are greeted by a very professional and friendly host!   Ambiance: it's Vegas and it's at the Caesars... totally stylish and very steakhouse/seafood looking with a classic spin (don't really know if that means anything but it's really nice inside). Everything is also always being cleaned by staff... amazing...  Conclusion: you won't go wrong! Can you tell I love this place! Only con I guess would be that restrooms are upstairs (eh not a big deal)....",

    "text": "So this is a slam dunk from the old school vegas host to the wait staff that has been there forever to the amazing food.  If you have not experienced stone crab then you are missing one of life's delicacies. They are small crab and the meat is sweet.  Its also a more sustainable harvest as they simply remove 1 leg/claw per crab and then let them live to grow it back!  From my standpoint you have stone crab as an appetizer and then move on to bigger things...ribeye, amazing fried chicken, king crab, blackened halibut (this is a great option) or lamb chops.  Everything is always perfectly cooked and this is a dining experience for sure!  Don't go without a reservation and tip the host for a better seat (I LOVE OLD VEGAS BABY!!).  Enjoy!",

The staff a d service was impeccable  We had about 20 people and everyone raved about the food. We shared multiple appetizers and each one outdid the other, especially those fried oysters!!! The sommelier was very helpful. I enjoyed my filet with crab so much I wanted it the next day, but alas, I left that day. We also bought two of the crab pins to support the great staff.   Definitely the spot for an upscale dining experience in Vegas! Dont miss it!",

The restaurant is located at the bottom floor of the Ceasar Palace Mall for anyone who is looking for it. Employees of the mall are not super happy when you're asking for directions instead of buying something.  We had reservations and was immediately seated outside of the restaurant, so I can't really say anything about aesthetics. The waiters were extremely attentive and helped explain any discrepancies in the menu about market price.   We ordered a lot of dishes including the baked mushrooms, the calamari, the lobster bisque and the stone crabs. The food came out extremely fast and was pretty delicious over all (especially the crabs). I'm pretty indifferent about the other dishes. We probably ate so fast that the waiters though we've been starving ourselves!   Would recommend a visit to this restaurant if you're ever visiting Vegas.",

    "text": "We had a celebration dinner here with family. 14 adults and 2 children in our group. I was able to get reservations for us on Saturday at 6PM just the day before. You do have to sign a contract, as well as provide a credit card to reserve tables for a group this large, and you will be charged a fee if you no-show your reservations. I was glad they were able to accommodate us on short notice.  The service by our primary server was decent. His ancillary team was always around so our 2 large tables was always able to request what they needed. I took off a star because the woman who brought our wines (we got 3 bottles) did not even give us an opportunity to taste/smell them prior to being served. I told our primary server that we wanted a big buttery white wine, and naturally he suggested an expensive bottle from France, unfortunately it was more sweet, and not buttery or oaky at all.  The food was hit and miss. I would avoid the Lyonnaise potatoes, and most of the sides were just okay. We had the fried asparagus, creamed spinach, Jennie's mashed potatoes, and grilled corn. The seafood tower was good, filet was meh, get the bone-in ribeye if you want meat.  Overall, it was a good dinner, but I think our group would have enjoyed eating at Bacchanal more, and it would have cost the same if not less. You also do not accrue any Total Rewards credits here, nor can you use city-wide dining credits, it's one of only three on the Caesars property that do not participate in Total Rewards, bummer.",

The restaurant looks and feels fancy, but the staff are so easygoing and friendly that you don't feel TOO fancy... does that make sense? Anyway...  We ordered a number of seafood dishes as well as vegetable sides, and everything was sooooooo yummy.  Then came dessert.   Our server recommended the Havana Cream Pie and one other dish, but since the hubs LOVES bananas, we decided to go with Banana Cream Pie.  O... M... G...  They are both so creamy, soft, velvety, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. They are sweet enough to bring a yummy end to your meal, but they're not cloyingly sweet so you don't feel like you need a large cup of black coffee to balance it out.  So, in conclusion: Go for the food, but DON'T LEAVE WITHOUT THE DESSERT!  Now, the hubs are I are on the lookout for anywhere in LA that will do Banana Cream Pie justice like Joe's.",

The one out of British Columbia were the smallest bit they had an amazing sweetness that I really liked. My other half liked the cowboy the best.  We also got a bowl of the crab bisque and the Manhattan clam chowder.   Both were very good. I liked the clam chowder the best but I love soup and it is more of a soup. And the bisque was rich and lots of flavor like a bisque should be, it didn't have a lot of crab but there was some.  They also are part of the app lettuce eats and so I was able to add some points. The rest of the food around us looked fantastic I hope to come back for dinner sometime.",

    "text": "We were celebrating our youngest daughter's 21st birthday, so it was my wife and I, our two daughters, and two of their friends. We had a wonderful time. Our dinner started with the appetizers of Stuffed Mushrooms, Oysters Rockefeller, and the pound and a half cluster of Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs. Wow, the appetizers alone were amazing. Our waiter said they were the best crab legs in Vegas, and we all think he was right: nice and big, and the server expertly cut the legs in half so all we needed to do was split them apart and dig the sweet chunks of meat out with the crab pick.   Our waiter helped pick out a wine, and everyone in our group thought it was great (I couldn't give you a personal opinion because I don't drink alcohol).  For our main course, I had the Seared Scallops, my wife had the Seafood Chopped Salad, my oldest daughter had the Chilean Sea Bass, her boyfriend and my youngest daughter split the 30 oz Porterhouse, and my youngest daughter's friend had the King Crab Louis salad. For our sides, we had the mashed potatoes, the crispy Brussels Sprouts, and  the steamed asparagus.   My Seared Scallops came with \"bacon jam,\" which was tasty, but the four scallops seemed a little meager. The salads were big; I helped my wife finish hers, and it was nice to see some edamame mixed in with the greens. Everyone else enjoyed their main course. The mashed potatoes were good, but the steamed asparagus was just average (maybe we should have tried the fried asparagus, instead). The Brussels Sprouts I thought were a bit too well done. I know they're supposed to be crispy, but there was no \"meat\" to them since they were so overcooked. It was like eating dried leaves.  Service was very attentive, and the atmosphere reminded my daughter's boyfriend of the old restaurants in New York City. The restaurant is located at the very far end of the Caesar's Palace Forum shops, so if you parked at self parking, you're going to do a lot of walking to get to the restaurant (and a nice long walk back). Once you get to the end of the shops, take the elevators downstairs.",

Food - love the grilled seafood platter, stone and Alaskan crab. Succulent and sweet and quite fresh. Price is not too bad for what it is..  Ambiance - service is great, typical old school dining. Dining room is usually always packed.  Quick tip: tell the taxi to drop you off at the valet at forum shops closer to the strip; otherwise it's a long trek from the main forum shop drop off.

The rib-eye is beautifully fatty and well-marbled so together they are out of this world.  I went with my best friends and shared the perfectly cooked Lyonnaise potatoes as a side, which are hash browns with caramelized onions and is enough to share between four people.  This is a destination because they are so attentive and very accomodating while serving you lavishly hearty food.  My friend started getting meat sweats finishing the 20 oz steak but he cannot help clean his plate especially when you sprinkle it with the special rub that they provide.  Did I mention that they served delicious bread as soon as we sat down?  We felt so pampered and full as we trundled out of this joint.

We ordered a few sides.  The cream corn was average and had way too many ingredients in it.  The hash browns were bland and over cooked.  We also ordered the green beens amandine which were good.  All of the sides you can order as half sides for $4.95 instead of $7.95 for a full order.  We had the wedge salad which was good.  For dinner we ordered the select 6 stone crabs, the surf and turf with filet and three stone crab legs.  The stone crab legs were very average and not very sweet.  I was suggested to order the 6 premium for $40 instead of the $30 for six medium.  Not a great suggestion at all.  We had the key lime pie and the havana cream pie.  The key lime pie came out too cold.  Get that thing to room temp first before presenting it to customers!  All in all, I had talked up this restaurant to my gf and her sister and we were very disappointed.  To top this, we didn't have any alcohol and the total bill came to $190!!!!  How did that happen.",

We had an 8:30 reservation so tables were clearing out as we were dining, so there should of been no need for the rush.  The food quality seemed to decline since our last visit also, the Jeenies Mashed Potatoes were dry, and the asparagus was undercooked.  Although I did have the Bone-in Filet, and it was perfect.  By 8:30 they were sold out of the large claws so we ordered the Selects, and they were extremely tough, my suggestion is if that the large claws are sold out, save your money and order something else.

    "text": "we ended our vegas trip with a last dinner at Joe's. It was awesome. The stone crab claws were really yummy...don't need the sauce that comes with it, but the sauce is good too. My crab stuffed sole was fantastic and my mom's salmon was really good...not stingy with the portion. The salmon was actually like a huge steak in size! Sides: jenny's potatoes - nothing to write home about but good. the pan roasted corn: OMG pure heaven. Delicious! How good can corn be? This good! We almost passed on dessert but wisely we opted to split the Key Lime Pie, which is understandably, their signature dessert. Your meal is not complete here without capping off with this dreamy heavenly pie. Really awesome. Service was good, little bread basket wonderful. Will come again!",

    "text": "We went to Joe's in Chicago last October and loved it!  We were happy to find there was one on the West coast.  One of the reasons why our evening was so memorable there was because we had a wonderful waiter.  On planning our trip to Las Vegas, we immediately made reservations at Joe's.  Unfortunately our experience wasn't the same because of our waitress.  I noticed the table next to us had a waiter very similar to our Chicago one in that he explained so much to the diners.  The food was  still delicious though!",

I usually order they lunch special which includes 4 claws, hash browned potatoes, cole slaw and a slice of key lime pie.  It's the best overall deal for lunch.  The potatoes are pretty bad however.  Too salty and dry.  Everything else is great especially the key lime pie.  The key lime pie is the best I've ever had.  Perfect blend of sweetness and tart.  They somehow manage to serve this at the perfect temperature also, just below freezing.   Definitely worth the visit.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Joe's Seafood, but we won't be returning -- there are many other steak and seafood restaurants in the city to choose from.  We booked an early reservation because we had tickets to a Cirque show afterwards, so the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived.  Despite this, they seated our party of 7 at the worst possible table in the room, right outside the noisy kitchen.  That's one of my pet peeves about restaurants, and major points off for that.  But the worst was my steak, which was one of the worst-trimmed steaks I've ever had the misfortune to be served in a restaurant, rife with gristle that I had to spit out more than once, and then take care to trim around.  Their menu says they serve prime steaks, and believe me, this was no prime steak.  For $46 (just for the steak) I deserved a lot better.  They have a great bread basket but points off for the cold rolls in it.  Thankfully, most of the other food was fine and the service was adequate.  They screwed up a couple of the orders but it was a large table, and they corrected everything when we pointed it out to them.  Still, our table dropped $800 for dinner, wine, tax, and tip, and for that kind of money we believe we can do better.  So can you -- look elsewhere.",

It took us forever to get our food and before we even finish eating they started to clear out our table. The waiters were horrible, all they do was stand around and staring down customers. I guess they feel that they don't need to wait on people that are not of their kind (non-whites) and their automatic 18% gratuity gives him the incentive not to treat all customers the same. It was not worth the walk down the strip. Although this may be the most horrible experience during the whole trip, I still enjoyed myself in sunny Las Vegas.",

My wife enjoyed an above-average petite filet. Fortunately, she had me eat some of it, because she had  enjoyed too much of that great bread basket. For our apetizer and my John Dory, we ordered a '09  Chateau Perenchere Bordeaux blanc -- and our fine server, John Lucas, said it was an unappreciated bottle. It went very well with the crab and my fish. For the filet, and after some discussion with John, we ordered a glass of a nice Bethel Heights pinot noir, ' 08 (as I recall). Their wine list is reasonable and a lot of fun. I will be back.",

And from what we could see from the entrance, nothing looked worth waiting that long.    So on a whim we Yelped and found Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  And we were so glad we ended up at Joe's rather than at Bacchanal.    Food was sooo good.  First off, fresh oysters were amazing.  Stone crabs were good, although they were not as sweet as I had hoped.  Mustard sauce they served alongside was really good though.  What I enjoyed the most was the ribeye.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  Loved it.  Key lime pie was a perfect ending to a wonderful dinner.    The place had good energy all around, and I loved that we didn't have to talk over loud music or rowdy people near by.    Service was awesome.  The whole team was super friendly and professional.",

Although they're known for their stone crab legs, they're Alaskan king crab legs is where it's at! You can also eat low carb if you skip the bread.

Although it's hard to believe, it's all keto friendly (I checked). I was at once relieved and excited to keep a personal favorite eatery despite my now strict dietary restrictions. Service was great as usual, and my partner and I had a young woman as my server(which is unusual for joes seafood). I've always had older gentlemen servers here l. I was happy to see lettuce entertain Keep up with the times and be progressive with their hiring practices. This is and will continue to be a staple of mine when I'm feeling real extra and in dire need of a kings feast! Joe's is ideal for a special date or occasion.

    "text": "I came here for dinner last weekend, and it was my first time visiting. One of my friends recommended this restaurant and made a reservation for our group. In all my past trips to Vegas and the Forum Shops, I somehow managed to overlook this restaurant, but to be fair, it's on the bottom floor of the more quiet section of the Forum. Once we checked in, I was surprised at how large this restaurant is with several dining rooms in the back. The restaurant was full-it was about 8:30pm on a Saturday. Thank goodness we had reservations!   I had studied the menu before coming so I had an idea of what I wanted to order. I was in a party of 8 so we decided to share an appetizer and side dishes and have everyone order their own entrees. The side dishes here are a la carte. I ordered the seafood platter, which was a plate of grilled seafood-scallops, shrimp, and a small lobster tail. The seafood was tasty and just what I wanted with the exception of the lobster tail being over grilled. The calamari, mac and cheese, fries, and mashed potatoes were all very delicious! Also, they have an amazing bread basket here, I especially loved the jalapeno corn bread. We ordered two bottles of sauvignon blanc to pair with our seafood, and it was refreshing and complemented our meal perfectly. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert, although it would have been a nice touch if the restaurant provided our bride to be with a little celebratory dessert (I was here for a bachelorette party).   Also, service was a bit slow and I often had to look/flag down a server. Not the top notch service I was expecting for such a top notch place, but that's okay-we all enjoyed our experience here, and I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Joe's is a classic steak house in both food and atmosphere.  We sat in the \"patio\" section of the restaurant looking out to the Forum Shops.  There is super easy valet parking right outside of the restaurant.  My mom's fried oysters were definitely the best thing my party of 5 ordered.  They were delectable!  We all LOVED them.  My hubby really liked his fried chicken.  I found it tasty, but nothing special.  I would skip this dish.  I like meat rare.  My dad ordered his steaks medium-well, so I cannot judge this overcooked piece of meet.  He was happy with it.  My crab cake was tasty, but nothing amazing.  I was coveting the fried oysters.  The key lime pie is a skip it.  It was served almost frozen.  The brownie sundae was also a skip it.  It had a traditional taste to it with a rich brownie, but it was a 3/5 at best.  Our waitress was nice, but I felt we had to hunt her down.  We went very long stretches without seeing her.  I ordered my son's dessert and paid my bill through someone else because I could not find her.  (-1 star)  Bottom Line:  This was NOT my favorite meal on this trip to Vegas.  The food is good with a nice atmosphere, but Bacchanal is just so much better!!",

Traditional key lime pie if you want to be True to the Miami theme.  I however am addicted to their peppermint stick ice cream with fudge sauce...simply the best!",

I like my meat on the rarer side so that there's more juice but since my order came medium the filet was dry dry dry!! There wasn't even au jius :(   I resulted in drowning my filet in the butter they gave me for the lobster.

We had dinner reservations at 10:30 pm and when we got there we were greeted by the host and got seated right away in a very cozy booth.  When the waiter came around he brought us a basket of assorted bread, butter and water. As we looked over the menu we both decided that we were gonna get the Steak Tartare for our appetizer and our main course we both got the 24oz Bone-in Ribeye (medium rare of course), and our sides of sauteed Broccolini, Crispy Brussel Sprouts and Crispy Onion Strings...   What can I say, EVERYTHING was so damn good!!! I felt like I've died and gone to heaven!!! The ribeye was cooked to perfection and was so juicy and it came with the house salt which had salt, pepper coriander, shallots, and garlic...I think my eyes rolled back when I tasted the first slice I cut! And the sides, boy oh boy my friend and I picked some really good sides... My favorite one was the Crispy Brussel Sprouts... Lastly, dessert! Banana Cream Pie with Foster Sauce... Best decadent Banana Cream Pie I ever had!  The service was TOP NOTCH!!! Everyone was lovely! I will surely come back!!! Trust me on that!!!",

Not rated higher because of host service. Once we were basically ignored by the host who was too busy broing it up with other dudes. The other time we were seated at a table that had water dripping on it from the cieling. When we asked about it they didn't immediately move us but asked if it was a problem.",

    "text": "Went here in Late Dec.  It was my 2nd time visiting this restaurant.  Our waiter Neil was great(at first).  He was attentive and knowledgable and nice.  My wife and ordered cocktails, a Ribeye ($60), and the stone crab.  Steak was absolutely excellent.  Really good steak.  Stone crab was very disappointing for the price.  Five small pre-cooked cold claws for $70 that did not have much meat. Definitely skip those in my opinion. Sides are what you would expect, nothing out of this world but definitely satisfactory.    Halfway through the dinner the waiters demeanor totally changed.  He was short and seemed upset.  We even asked him what happened and he mentioned another table was being problematic.  I understand this can be tough as a waiter but when I'm spending $280(with tip) for a dinner for two and tipping $50 I would think he would have figured out how to not let this affect his other tables.  Anyway.  Great steak, service this time was .. meh... and stone crab a complete rip off.  Over all a 2 star.  If I could just rate the steak it would be 5 stars all the way.  We are going back to Vegas in a couple months, after the first trip here it became our go to place for our nice dinner, after this experience we will probably look around for something else(or just go get a steak and get in and get out) rather than it being our big dinner when in town for a weekend.",

When I first viewed the menu I became like a kid in a candy store. Everything on the menu was what we were looking for. King crab, Lobster, Oysters Rockefeller,  Crab cakes and it goes on and on,  besides the prime beef.  As it would happen, I ordered it all. First the appetizer with King Crab, Shrimp and lobster. Then the Oysters, then a pound of King Crab Legs and then a lobster tail. I know what you are thinking, yet, I did finish it all,  but my Fiance' could barely finish the crab cakes that were all crab. I helped finish them. Yes, I was happily distressed.  The food was perfect, the service was perfect and the check was a bit high. Our next visit to Las Vegas will definitely include Joes Seafood and Prime Steak Restaurant with a more moderate appetite. Do not miss it, but make a reservation when we are not there.",

The prices are very good for a steak and seafood restaurant too!

They never came to clean the crumbs off the table, never refilled our water, took the bread off the table to refill, never returned.  Filet was supposed to be midrare, came out cold and raw.  Ahi tuna was supposed to be seared, came out grey and completely unseasoned.  Gave the sides to the wrong people.  Took 20 minutes to get a beer at the table.  The wine came in reasonable time.

Starving for something delicious and meaty we stumbled across Joe's tucked just inside the Forum shops and decided to give it a go.  Although we were a little put off by the pricing, which was expensive at best, my hopes perked up when I checked out some earlier yelp reviews.    In short \"food delicious, service not so much.\"  I would have to agree when I was forced to pull out my trusty \"eyebrow raise/foot tap\" to call one of the hosts over to the front desk.  If am I preparing to spend over $100 on a meal for two lets at least get the front lines ready with a \"hello and how many?\"  We sat in the bar at a high top table and were given with a small varietal bread basket to nosh on. We ordered two medium rib eyes, which came out perfectly cooked, and small side order of green beans.  The steaks had a delicious crusty exterior but were a bit salty in my opinion, as were the beans.  Instead of giving a side sauce they included a small ramekin of \"steak seasoning\" which I believe was just extra kosher salt mixed with dried shallot, oregano etc...unnecessary.  Was it good? Yes. Will I be back? Probably not.  For all the hype that surrounds this place I would have expected something darker, more sexy.  The food was just ok and the old Frank Sinatra-ish vibe could have improved with some shorter tables and/or booths.  I wasn't unhappy but I wasn't completely satisfied overall.  Go, yes and pass your own judgment.",

The ambiance was nice for Vegas and we had a great night service wise.  We started with the Caesar salad, stone crab bisque, and the stone crab appetizer.  The salad and the bisque were not notch!  Thinking about the soup makes me want to go back!  The crab claw was good but I felt like it was a little overpriced.  I get that it's Vegas but still.  For the entree my husband did the filet mignon and I did the scallops (I don't eat red meat).  The filet was the perfect size given all sour starters and smash husband thought it was cooked well.  My scallops were goodbut very rich.  Beware that they are battered and then pan fried.  I'm not used to the battered part.  The portion was huge and I just couldn't get through it.  For sides the table got the creamed spinachs, hash browns, and a seasonal corn dish.  I woud order all of them again.  Some of our friends opted for the Filet/lobster combo for dinner.  While they loved the filets, they did not rave about the lobster.  My recommendation would be to skip the lobster and get more sides.",

Me and my boy ordered medium-rare while another one of us ordered medium-well.  The steaks all came medium-well.  Then to top it all off it took FOREVER to get our food in a place that wasn't even half full.  If you're looking for stone crabs, I'd recommend this place, but don't come here looking for a good steak.  I've made better steaks on my grill at home buying the beef at Costco.",

We were treated absurdly well by our waiter, John, who was really the kind of waiter you'd expect and want in an old-school, classy restaurant like this.   The food was delicious and, of course, the stone crab was amazing. They serve it with a dijon sauce (I am used to butter with crab usually) and that was a great addition. I also really, really loved the green beans (which they have a far fancier name for) and my dinner, the crab-stuffed sole, was a new food to me and I loved it.   I was particularly pleased with how accommodating they were of my dietary needs -- I couldn't have the lobster sauce that comes with the sole so they put it on the side and offered me several other choices. It sounds small, but it was a gracious gesture and they did not make a big deal out of it.

    "text": "Stone crabs: love!  sweet and succulent.   When I have Alaskan king crab legs at buffets, the meat tastes salted; there is no taste of artificial flavors in these!  If you like a steak (filet) at Flemings or Maestros; pass on the filet here.  It's still a USDA prime cut, the filet really lacks in flavor.  Consider it \"healthy\".  Don't expect a buttery dish or a steak full of flavor.  Take a pass on the mac and cheese and corn.  The server will sell you on these items; making them appear to be the best thing in the world; but I beg to differ.  Great service!",

    "text": "Wow, this place is really great.  Of course, it is pricey but definitely worth it.  To save some money, you can order off of the Bar Menu selection.  This is what the people in my party did, and the food was no less delicious for it.  To start, the bread was quite tasty.  For dinner, I ordered the Beef Tenderloin Sandwich and substituted sweet potato fries for regular (at no additional cost).  Joe's serves this sandwich akin to sliders, with three small sandwiches on the plate.  The tenderloin was excellent quality, and the bread it was served on was phenomenal.  One other person in my party ordered the Ribeye Sandwich, also from the Bar Menu, and was able to substitute a salad for fries.  This sandwich is served on a sub-type roll.  A very good quality sandwich as well.  We ordered grilled asparagus as a side, which I would say was the only disappointing part of the meal.  It's not that the asparagus was bad, but I feel they charge too much for the quantity given.  When it came time for dessert, the waitress explained they are all homemade.  I had several questions, which she patiently answered and described in further detail the desserts I asked about.  She also explained that each dessert is large enough to share, and they also have \"half sizes\" not listed on the menu.  I decided to share the Chocolate Fudge cake, which was heavenly.  The other person in my group had the Key Lime Pie, which was not a portion large enough to share, but was described by them as the best they've ever had.  I was thrilled with this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Every now and then a girl has to treat herself.   A nice new pair of shoes, some pretty undies, a decadent spa treatment, etc....these are all things a lady will do for herself sometimes.    Yesterday I decided my treat was to get some crabs.  Ok, Ok, get your mind out of the gutter, even if I am in \"Sin City\"  you know that is not where I am going with this.   Joe's has a dark wood interior with a large patio and all the servers in their crisp black and whites, I felt a little underdressed in my no-makeup-tennis-shoe look.  This was not to stop me, however from getting my crabs.  For those that don't know, stone crab is only really in season for three months and usually comes from the Gulf in Florida.  It's a rare treat, these little claws of perfection, so you have to get them while the getting is good.   I sat down and the server immediately came over. She was pleasant and helped me find an excellent medium bodied glass of white wine to complement my seafood. Throughout my whole meal she was attentive, polite, and personable.     I chose an appetizer for my lunch, but this was no mere starter - this was the \"2nd Mortgage\".  A stone crab claw, a jumbo shrimp, a small lobster tail and a small portion of shrimp/scallop cerviche, all chilled with cocktail and mustard sauces for dipping.  This was a dish to relish so I took my time. All the seafood was cooked and chilled to perfection with that just caught fresh taste. I really wish I had just gotten a plate of the stone crab because that one claw was so good I am already having major cravings for more.  All in all a perfect dining experience - a girl has to treat herself and to borrow from a certain ad campanign - \"I'm worth it\"",

I still want to try stone crab though since its in their name so it must be what they're known for.  we got 24 oysters. wow they were soo good and fresh! must get if you come here.  we also got like a seafood sampler.  the seafood tasted fresh and I really liked the scallops cerviche.  I also got the bone in rib eye. it was soo good!! very tender and the seasoning was really good.  also got the mashed potatoes.  it looked pretty fancy.  came with cheese and the crunchy bread crumbs on top.  I didn't like how the cheese got stuck together so I would get this without the cheese on top, or less cheese if you can?  overall pretty good food",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price  We went to Joe's Seafood while we were in Vegas for a friend's 40th birthday.   FOOD  The food was really tasty.  We had crab bisque, seafood pasta and a Filet & Tail.  We were not hungry enough for sides but the rest of the table enjoyed the selection.   The Crab Bisque was prepared better than the majority of restaurants. The only thing it was lacking was a little extra Crab.  I had the Filet & Tail.  The steak was prepared medium rare how I like it and had an excellent side seasoning which you don't need to much of but is good to bring the flavor together. The Lobster tail was good but a little over salted.  My girlfriend has the Seafood pasta and said it tasted too healthy.  That is not a real complaint unless you are anti healthy options.  The pasta had a subtle pesto flavor and was cooked perfectly. The Seafood was also prepared very well and combined with the pasta to bring the tastes together very well.   Overall the food was about 3/4 of a star. I am taking a little off for the over salting of the lobster and lack of crab in the bisque.   ALCOHOL  The alcohol was pretty good. We are big Bourbon drinkers and they had a good selection of bourbons and my girlfriend had Amador neat which was the first time we tried it and it was a great sipping Bourbon.    I had an Old Fashioned which was made very well. My girlfriend found it a tad too sweet. However it was one of the better Old Fashioned I have had compared to other seafood and steak houses.   Our friend had their version of a Cosmo and said it was very good.    Overall I would give the restaurant 1/2 a star for alcohol.   CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE   The restaurant was very clean which is to be expected since it is a Seafood and Steak place in Las Vegas. Since I complained about the restroom in a previous review I will note that this one was very clean.   The ambiance is great although a little loud but that is to be expected in a steakhouse with a large dining area.  This is not the romantic dinner for two stop.    Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets one star.   SERVICE  The service was great the waitress was excellent and gave good suggestions when asked.  She was also patient with me when I was breaking down the bill for three different payments.  Since I end up doing this at every outing, her patience was very much appreciated.   Overall the service deserves one star.   VALUE/PRICE  The restaurant is priced appropriately for being a Seafood and Steak Restaurant in Las Vegas. We had four drink, two meals and a appetizer and with tip the check came to $200 which is absolutely reasonable.  My one comment on this though would be for that money there are better options in Las Vegas.  If I was at their D.C. location I might visit again.    Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.   In conclusion the restaurant is about 4 stars.   There are far better options in Las Vegas and I probably won't be back unless someone reserves there again. However, the food, drinks and service were very good and should be recognized and rated appropriately.",

    "text": "We had an amazing time at Joe's! The service, food and atmosphere (dinning area) were on point.   For food we had:    - jumbo Alaskan king crap: it comes chilled served with drawn butter. They also cut it so that it is extremely easy to remove the crab from the shell, there is no mess at all. The crab was perfect and buttery. It was delicious and look forward to eating this again!!!   -the miso sea bass: seriously beyond phenomenal! I have had miso before but put together with the sea bass and the way they prepared it it was hands down the best we have ever had.   - 16oz sirloin: cook medium, husband thought it was good and cooked perfectly. It was served with a sea salt herb mix on the side that was a great addition to a typical ribeye.   - lyonnaise side dish: if I were to describe this in simple terms it is a large hash brown with caramelized onions. However, it was the crunchiest hash brown (outside only) I have ever had...in a good way. Then it is topped with an amazingly sweet caramelized pile of onions. In all honesty I won't be getting this again because it want spectacular like the other Items we had. However, I did eat all the onions because they were that good. Also just to mention the portion was huge! We probably are 1/5 of the side. Although I can see a couple eating 1/3 if they were really hungry.   -key lime pie: if you have never had real key lime pie made from real key lime juice then this is going to be similar to what you have had except that I notice it was more sweet than tart. The crust was extremely rich and buttery. If you have never had True key lime pie then you have to try this be it is really good.   -banana fosters cream pie: this was my favorite dessert between the two (but only because the key lime I have had at other restaurants that were equally as good) it was a banana cream pie that was more cream than bananas topped with thick Carmel and candied pecans. For both desserts they offered half portions and between the two pies it was more than enough.   We plan on returning and trying more items from their menu!",

This is an old school establishment -- you know the kind where the waiters are dressed in suits, are attentive but not hounding you every 2 seconds and don't reach over you to grab dishes?  You can tell that these waiters take their job seriously and they are all pros at it - they move around the restaurant like a well oiled machine.  It's hard to find places like that anymore but Joe's is one of them.  The stone crab is delicious and we always get them as an appetizer.  I usually get lobster or shrimp for dinner there, but found out that they are also known for their fried chicken so that will be on the list to try the next time.  Everything I've had has been fantastic.  I'll be back Joe's!",

We made a reservation same day for lunch with the wonderful gentlemen at the front who was very accommodating.  After being seated, a wonderful warm bread assortment was served with butter.  We enjoyed oysters Rockefeller appetizer and the king crab lunch special that comes with two full sides and a choice of pie for dessert!  The key lime pie lived up to the other reviews for sure!  The 10 oz of king crab was delicious and very filling...just be sure to tell them you'd like it steamed, not cold.  Overall, a very pleasant ambiance and experience.  Fair price and so much better than waiting in long buffet lines for crab legs.  The wait from our appetizer to main entry was a bit long, but it was quite busy.  It was a full house on Saturday, so just be prepared.",

    "text": "Unbelievable meal. Especially for Vegas, Joe's shines above and beyond. It offers that ridiculously high end and casual all in one. They have a back room for that fine dining experience in the Forum and the outside and bar area for a more casual fling.   I usually don't go to the high scale restaurants on the strip, but I happened to have a discount and decided to splurge. I went with a few other people and we decided to basically taste the entire menu, - drinks to dessert.   Our total meal left us filled to the brim. Everything was great, while some dishes were simply outstanding. We began with calamari, oysters, tartare and some bread. The oysters came with some type of crystal horseradish that was simply delicious. The tartare was perfect. We then had a few salads to cross the bridge to dinner. Dinner handed us stone crab, king crab, and steak. I had never had stone crab and was actually a little disappointed in the flavor, but no doubt it was perfectly prepared. The king crab was just outstanding and the best tasting crab legs I have ever had. The steak was fantastic but I'd still go with seafood first and foremost. Finally to dessert. I don't usually venture to the dessert menu but when splurging might as well open up the belt bucket. The key lime pie, their flagship, was great. Get it - doesn't matter if you like key lime pie or not. And try one of their dessert mix drinks as well.   Overall one of the best meals I have ever had, not just in Vegas. Perfect food, perfect staff, and pretty secluded at the bottom of the shops so you can people watch but not be thrown into the life of the Forum Shoppes like other restaurants in Caesar's. The bill will be expensive but for a nice meal you can't go wrong with Joe's.",

But the salad left something to be desired. Portion was relatively small and the lettuce was an iceberg mix. I probably should've ordered something else, but it was decent nonetheless.

    "text": "5 stars - hands down!!!  My husband, cousins and I decided to go here for dinner while in Las Vegas (based on the Yelp reviews) to celebrate my birthday and our wedding anniversary and it was also our cousins mini honeymoon.  It was a little hard to find from where we parked - it's on the 1st floor at the far end but we asked around and were finally pointed in the right direction.  Our server, David, was awesome!!!! Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, funny. Couldn't have been better. Our water glasses never emptied, he gave us excellent recommendations when we asked, he checked on us multiple times to be sure everything was perfect - he was just great!  We ended up ordering way too much food! The side dishes are separate from the entrees and, although we found out you can order 1/2 orders of the side dishes, they were still big enough to be shared between the 4 of us.  We ordered the Filet Mignon and King Crab, Filet Mignon and Lobster and the fried chicken. As sides we shared 1/2 portions of the Lyonnaise potatoes, Big Daddy potatoes, roasted sweet corn, Mac and cheese, steamed asparagus, fried asparagus with lemon sauce, creamed spinach. We had SO much left over but oh my Lord the food was SO SO SO good! We all agreed it was one of, if not THE, best meal we'd ever had. The food was excellent!!!! Every item was absolutely delicious!  David also talked us into dessert (even though we were SO full) so we ordered 1/2 portions of the Banana Cream Pie with Foster sauce and Key Lime Pie to share and he also brought us Brownie a la mode for our celebration. All 3 were excellent but the Banana Cream Pie was our fav.  This place is fancy but it's not overwhelming so. We all felt that, for a fine dining experience, this place is very reasonably priced. You get fairly large portions and the even the half sides are pretty large.  Reservations recommended. When we got there for our 6:30pm reservation, their next availability was 9:30pm.  Our entire experience from start to finish was wonderful! 5 stars - highly recommend!!!",

This is what we ordered: - Crab bisque I am so glad that I found another place in town that has awesome crab bisque because my favorite is actually a lobster bisque that I had once at Treasures (Yeah...not someplace don't find myself returning to just for bisque =P ) It is super rich and flavors are just right.  I loved dipping some of the bread from the bread basket in it. My husband had a few spoonfuls and loved it.  - BLT Wedge salad From what I tasted, it was OK. Definitely had better.  Still love the \"bacon salad\" at Del Frisco's Double Eagle steakhouse though.  - Stone crab (medium) You get 7 nice size claws. Definitely enough to share between two people.  The best part was the mustard dipping sauce!  - Copper river sockeye salmon w/ key lime butter Ever since I had this kind of salmon in Alaska, I've been hooked.  It has just the right amount of fat and is not dry.  Mine was cooked to perfection at medium.  - Dry aged bone in rib eye Delicious, no complaints here.   After all of that, there was barely any room for dessert; however, we were presented with a complimentary anniversary dessert.  The brownie and vanilla ice cream was basic, nothing special.  We did ask our server about dessert recommendations for next time.  The key lime pie is a gimme and we were intrigued our servers description of the Havana pie (like tres leches!!).  Reservations highly recommended! We look forward to coming back =)",

Creamed spinach was flavorful and filling for two in addition to the simple veggies plated with the meal. Looking forward to my next visit.",

The claws, tails, and crab legs were also top notch. The servers are very friendly, as is the staff at the door. Overall great experience. You must go here if you enjoy seafood.  They also have private rooms if you want to bring a large group there. I was recently there for a bachelor party and it was a very nice set up.",

    "text": "Don't waste your money on this place.  Go to Del Frisco's instead.  Way better quality.  Joe's has a nice ambience; it is conveniently located in Caesar's and the after-dinner coffee was tasty but the positives end there.  I can't believe this place gets so many 4* reviews.  Although a variety of bread is presented in the basket, the bread lacks freshness and isn't served warm.  The butter was hard too.  My husband and I order calamari everywhere we go and this was pretty poor- small skinny pieces, chewy and nothing special or tasty about it at all.  The breading wasn't hot and crispy like one would expect.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes from a box.  My husband got the dover, which was deboned tableside, but it was relatively tasteless.  He also had oysters and they were \"meh\" according to a guy who eats them often.    I had scallops and shrimp as my main course and both were overcooked which really impacts the flavor and texture of those foods.  I let my husband try some and he concurred that they were overcooked.  It's pretty bad to get that wrong when you are a steak and SEAFOOD restaurant.  The service was good although our table remained covered in crumbs and even though I brushed the table off in front of the waitress, she never scraped the crumbs between courses or when clearing the table like they do in a lot of \"better\" restaurants.  For the money I really expected better food and slightly more from the service.",

This place is high end in decor, service and quality, so expect to lay out about $100/person for drinks, salads, entree, etc.  But if you have never had a stone crab (I hadn't), it was a great experience.  Had to go with the 4 piece appetizer crab, which comes peeled like a hard boiled egg.  Really superior crab and you get their secret or not so secret mustard sauce, which was so good, I wouldn't let them take it after the appetizer.  Plenty of other things to dip in that sauce.  I had their BLT Wedge for a salad.  Nice portion, great mix of tastes, highly refreshing on a hot Vegas night.  For entree, I tried the Coho Salmon, as it has a short season, so you can't always find it.  No room for extra sides for me, as the crab, salad and salmon did me in.  Wish I had room for one of their famous pie desserts, but had to run off to see The Who at Cesar's, so saving that treat for a future trip.  Top line service.  We did originally get sat by the kitchen, but after lousy tables all weekend (and we had reservations for all the restaurants), I wasn't going to put out that kind of money for a lousy table.  Those can be for the stray walk ups, thank you very much.  I'll be back.  Hold my booth!",

While the service is not quite as good as you will get at some of the other higher priced restaurants ($60-100 per entree), Joe's provides better value ($30-60 entrees), with very good service.  For example, I arrived with black slacks on, but my white napkin was not replaced with a black napkin.  Service was certainly attentive, but not quite perfection.  However, the food was the star.  My wife and I tried a couple of the signature crab legs for an appetizer (they are listed as an order, but you are free to just get one or two if you want), and they were delicious.  For dinner, she ordered the sea bass, and I ordered the filet (oscar style), medium rare.  The sea bass was buttery and delicious, with a wonderful sauce that complemented it well.  The filet, I ordered medium rare - AND IT WAS!  That should not be a spectacular accomplishment, but having spent the week in Vegas and been to 3 higher price (celebrity-chef-associated) steakhouses who all over-cooked my steaks to medium, it was great to see a place who could cook a steak to order properly.  The filet was delicious.  For sides, we got the fried asparagus and macaroni and cheese.  Both were great, and the macaroni and cheese in particular was very rich and very satisfying.  I'd love to report on the desserts, but the food was so good that we were simply stuffed and could eat no more.",

Potato selection was impressive, you can't go wrong with any of them. And last but not least... I'm not a Key Lime Pie guy, but this is the best dessert I have ever had. Absolutely amazing experience!",

We frequent the one in Las Vegas as that's where we live but have also been to the one in Chicago and the original Joe's in Miami but lately we have been very disappointed. Like I said we eat at this location often and they know us but this week my husband tried to make a reservation for our 25th anniversary and they were so rude! They wouldn't accommodate us even after he told them we were celebrating a special occasion. I understand that they're busy but the receptionist was very rude and flippant!  Guess we'll be eating at our other favorite Mastro's Ocean Club (which we had no problem getting a reservation) The food is just as good and they're always friendly and accommodating!",

    "text": "Stone crab is served chilled and there are several different quality grades (regular, medium and large).  The server mentioned that large is not necessarily the best.  I just get the regular and they are sweet and meaty and don't feel like I'm missing anything by going large.    If you want stone crab, I think a good way to go is to get either their Seafood Chopped Salad or the Stone Crab Louie.  The helping of seafood is generous and you get a salad to break up the flavors.  Calamari was fine and the cocktail sauce with straight horseradish made it good.  The bread basket is filled with assorted breads (pretzel, rustic, crispy flat and wheat. The dessert that should not be missed (when it is in season) is the Blueberry Pie a la mode.  It was not available during this visit so I did the OK Havana Pie (tres leches cake style).  Service was friendly, excellent and exceeded my expectations: 1. Never having to ask for a drink refill 2. Water glasses always full 3. Additional bread offered 4. Checking in on our table at least 6 times during the meal 5. Engaged in pleasant conversation 6. Offered coffee and dessert without rushing the bill on us 7. Genuinely friendly server 8. Manager followed-up to see how things were going  They do <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a>  Try to sit outside if you are a large group of 5 or more.

For appetizers we tried the ceviche which was delicious and we all ordered a cup of the creamy crab bisque. Oh my goodness this was the best tasting soup I've ever had in my 24yrs.  Dinner I order a combination of a petite filet mignon and kind crab legs. The crab was fresh and delicious and don't get me started on that filet. Perfectly cooked and so tender. Melted in your mouth like butter. Our server gave us a complimentary brownie for my friends birthday which was a nice ending to the meal.  Overall it was one of the best meals that I've had in a while and I'm glad to know there is one in Chicago!",

    "text": "My husband was very happy with their lobster and steak combo meal, definitely worth the $65 he says, well, everyone is entitled with his or her opinions.  I tasted it.  They are good but not phenomenal.     My 9 year old had 3 of their baked potatoes with chives and butter, they are good but then what doesn't taste good with load of butter?   My older son scored!  his caesar salad was the best to me.  It had the perfect balance of flavors, delicious.    I was the least lucky one for the night.  I had a TERRIBLE TIME!  All because I started with the half-dozen oysters, which were not what I had expected.  First of all, they tasted bitter! The flavor didn't improve after I dipped them in the sauce it came with.  As a seasoned oyster sampler, I know the good fresh oysters don't need any sauce or dipping, they are good on their own.  Secondly, they were tiny. I'm talking about the actual meat part.  One of them was the size of my thumb nail, no kidding.    And worse of all, I had a very bad tummy ache right after I ate the oysters.  Ouch, ouch!  At this point I ordered their lobster bisque, thinking it might ease my tummy ache.  But the bisque tasted so weird, it was too salty, and too sweet at same time.  And my tummy ache got worse now, I had to let my son get up so I can lay down.  That didn't help, so I asked for some very hot water. Then another pot, and another.  I was sweating profusely after 3 pots of hot piping water by now, and I was a royal mess regretting ordering that wretched oysters.  But at least I could get up and walk back to our room at the end, thank God, we are not staying at Augustus tower this time, or I have to walk more.  I am thankful to that nice bus boy who brought me hot water. God bless u for ur sweet tender heart.  All this time, our waitress, a well-weathered one, witnessed my pain with such an indifference as if she has seen the world of suffering.  I think she was afraid if she admit i got ill from their oysters we may not pay her.  I know there are people who do that, but not us.  The bill was almost $200 with the wine, nothing was comped even with  my terrible plight.  She was very glad to take the hefty tip from us though.    I have never had reactions like this to the oysters before, and oysters are my favorite food if u read my profile.  It was just not my night.  Since the rest of my family did have good meal, I am giving them a very generous 3 stars.  I would have rated them higher if the waitress didn't retort me bitterly after I gave her my feedback of the oysters and the lobster bisque each time.  Hey, waitress lady, everyone else may prefer ur tiny bitter taste oyster but I don't, is that a crime?  Also, please don't look aghast when I tell u I didn't care the lobster bisque as if I am not refined enough to appriciate ur \"fine\" dinning.  A decent and graceful hostess would have taken it back right away.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that this is really more of a 3.5 than a straight 3 (Silly Yelp and it's refusal to allow for half-stars...)  I really enjoyed our evening at Joe's. I had never had stone crabs, and the claws we ordered were good, and the dipping sauce was completely addictive.  I ordered the salmon au poivre, and it was truly lovely. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the fennel and radish salad was refreshing and the perfect complement to the salmon. Other dishes at our table included two filets (perfectly cooked and seasoned) and one liver-and-onions. There's not a lot to be done about the texture, but the flavor of the liver and sauce was nice.  We decided on the pan roasted sweet corn, cole slaw, and celery root au gratin for the side dishes. The best part of the corn was all the smokey flavor of grilled corn without all the crap that gets caught in your teeth. The cole slaw is bright and vinegary, something I appreciated since I don't love mayo. The au gratin was a nice change from potato.  We concluded our meal with a slice of the signature key lime pie, which had one of the best graham cracker crusts I've ever had.   It was a nice meal, and everything was satisfying, so why three stars? Overall, it was a delicious meal, but a few things stuck out. For one, the crabs were great, but I'm not sure I felt like they were worth the $60. The au gratin was definitely under-seasoned, and I suspect that the pie was previously frozen because it certainly seemed frosty in the middle. Our server was nice, but he seemed to be reading from a script at times, and I was a little frustrated in his answers at points.   I would consider coming back to Joe's, but there are other places I'd rather try in the meantime.",

They have their own valet parking so if you aren't staying at Caesars, you should use their valet.  I had the bone in rib eye. So tasty. Very good portion. Would order it again. We also had some stone crab claws for an appetizer. They crack the crab for you so eating it is simple. Tastes fresh and the dipping sauce also adds to it. We had sides to share: mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. These are definitely for sharing. One order should feed at least four people easy. They do give you a free dessert on your birthday with a candle, But no singing at this classy establishment.  Overall great food. On the pricy side, so best reserved for a special occasion.",

    "text": "4.5 stars  I had dinner here on Sunday (1/22/12).  I made a reservation for 4 PM and was seated promptly.  I was asked by the maitre d' for my choice of watching football or watching people.  When I chose football, he showed me to a high top table in the front of the bar area.  Directly in front of me was a flat screen with the 49ers/Giants game.  During commercials, I could look out to the patio in the Forum Shoppes and people watch.  Since I chose this early time, the menu given me was the lunch menu.  I was told I could order from the dinner menu if I wanted, but the server didn't go to get a dinner menu.  It was just as well.  I ordered a cup of Stone Crab Bisque, the 12 ounce New York Strip Steak, and an individual portion of sauteed garlic spinach as my side.  For dessert, I got a half portion of their Peanut Butter Pie with hot fudge.  The soup was quite good.  The cup was just the right size.  The steak was superb!  It was charred on both sides and very rare inside--just as I ordered.  With it, they brought a small container of seasonings--ground salt, dried garlic, and other spices--to add to the steak.  It was great!!  The garlic spinach was also excellent.  Finally, the server told me that they had half-sized portions of dessert.  That's what I got, and it was more than enough to finish the meal.  Two reasons for the 1/2 star deduction from a full five.  One, since it was lunch, I guess, the bread selection wasn't a selection.  I was brought 2 small rolls, something I could buy in any grocery section.  That was quite disappointing.  Also, I waited about 10 minutes before the server first came to talk to me about ordering.  Since I was in no hurry, and I was watching the game, this was no problem.  Still, someone should have stopped by to assure me my server would be along.  It was busy, but not that busy.",

The claws are bigger than i thought they would be and very delicious. They come with a good mustard type dipping sauce. The Oysters Rockafella is the best that i ever had and I have had alot over the years.   For the main course we had the King Crab Legs which they cut with a scissors for you a the table making them very easy to eat. They are so big and so much of them that i couldnt even finish and needed to get some to go. Every piece of crab is at least the size of a hotdog. You don't have to work to hard to enjoy them. The other main course was crab stuffed shrimp. Needless to say that was great also.   For cocktails we had the Reisling and the Bloody Mary. Best Bloody Mary I have had that I can remember. It comes with a large shrimp in the glass and the rim is a great mixture giving it that extra flavor.   The service was great. Very professional yet friendly to joke around with.  Make sure you ask for Troy if you want good service. He took great care of us and we will make sure to see him again next time.",

    "text": "We went here in a pinch, after Celine Dion. We had talked about making reservations somewhere but ended up winging it.   I've been to the Miami location and Chicago (is it even there anymore?). SO had never been.  We ordered Pacific crab claws (completely disappointed that there were no stone crab claws...why do they keep them on the menu when they don't have them?) which were pretty good with the traditional mustard sauce, the 12 oz filet medium rare and the spinach.   The filet was the winner this night. It was cooked well and the seasoning salt that accompanies it was delicious.   We really liked the crab claws, they were tasty. We just wished for traditional stone crab as SO had never had them before and they are so hard to come by.  The spinach: frankly, I make better sauteed spinach at home.   I loved that they had Albarino and Sancerre by the glass. The wine list was nice and not exorbitantly marked up like everywhere else in Vegas.   For dessert we had peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. It was standard.   Joes reminds me a lot of Ruths Chris but add crab and minus some of the more delicious sides like sweet potatoes.   The service was excellent, as expected.  All in, it was $160 for two of us, splitting the filet, crab, 1 side, 1 glass of wine, a soda and ice cream. Pretty reasonable for Vegas!  Its a great restaurant if you aren't looking for the most favorite meal experience of your life  which you can also find in Las Vegas by just trying out your most favorite chef's restaurants.   Great late night option after a show at Caesars.",

I've definitely eaten better crab claws that are meatier, juicier and more fresh elsewhere in the world; namely Japan and Vancouver. I think it's overrated and not worth the money.  Dry aged rib-eye - not bad, cooked to medium as requested.   Service - waiter is attentive. However I don't like how they brought all the dishes at the same time when I clearly told him that we will eat the stone crabs as an appetiser. By the time we were finished with the crabs the rib-eye got cold, think it would have tasted better warmer.   Overall the quality of food and service they offer is not bad, but not worth this price. I personally think there are many restaurants that offer better food and service at a lower price in Las Vegas . I wouldn't come here again",

At first I was wondering how good crab can really be, but when the stone crab came with it already pre cracked so I just need to peal off the shells and eat the meat, I was in shock! The meat was so fresh and flavorfujust right, it was seriously the best stone crab, in fact the best crab I've never had!  We also ordered the rib eye steak and fillet mignon and both was really good and flavorful! I like my steak with fat so the rib eye was my favorite.  Not to forget the dessert we ordered banana cream pie it was also fantastic!  Just the right sweetness with good amount of crust.",

    "text": "Wow... It's as if Las Vegas was right next to the ocean. I say that because this has to be one of the best seafood places I have ever tried. Talk about fresh seafood.  I was here with 4 other colleagues of mine. We started off with some drinks and a 15 oyster platter. We got 3 different types of oysters and each one tasted absolutely amazing. Hands down those were by far the freshest, tastiest oysters I have ever had. Adding a hint of lemon juice just had to put it over the top. We had the steak tartare and that was pretty good.   Up next were 15 medium sized stone crab claws. I saw this on the menu \"Fresh stone crabs are found in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. They are hand-harvested, one claw at a time, and thrown back to the sea.\" and had to jump on it. When they came out, we started cracking. The table went silent and then was followed by \"mmms\" and \"ahhhhs\". I was in seafood heaven.  After that, we had the Alaskan king crab legs. We were told by the waitress that these legs are most fresh during these few weeks. Guess what? It was that time of the year.  We had a total of 2 orders and each bite was indescribable. Okay... let me describe it to you. They come pre-cracked. As you pull the flesh off of the shell, you dip the chilled crab meat into a small butter dish. Give it a few seconds for the butter to soak onto the surface of the crab meat. Take a bit and you'll find yourself in seafood heaven yet again. I died and was reincarnated at least 3 times that night.   The bill came out to around $600 with gratuity included. It was well worth it because one of our managers comped the meal for us! Sometimes you do get lucky in Vegas.",

I didn't send my food back because I was scared the cooks would spit in it or something. So I asked for the check so I can pay and leave.  The waiter was extremely nice and extremely handsome.

I didn't get to try the stone crab, but I got the rib eye and it was one of the best steaks I have eaten in my life. The cut was definitely their best. The steak itself was juicy and cooked to perfection. The flavors were delicately balanced and the seasoning was just right in that it did not overpower the meat and still let the steak be the star. The portion was massive, and I still couldn't stop eating it. Goes really well with a glass of red (I got the Merlot). Splendid experience and I can't wait to go back!",

For our entree, we shared a bone-in filet mignon and HUGE meaty crab legs (pre-cracked).  The meal was spectacular.  My only \"complainant\" is that the pop/soda was sold by the tiny bottle for $3.95 each.  We each drank 2, that's pricey!  The picture is deceiving.  I would guess they were 6oz bottles.",

Salt and pepper only for seasoning, and does not need anything else.  We shared a side of cream spinach, was a great addition.  The dessert menu is something to behold.

So glad we decided to dine here for dinner because we were blown away with the seafood here.  Staff are attentive, dressed very smart but there's no imposed dress code so we turned up in causal wear and felt comfortable dining here.   We ordered The Whale and Select Stone Crab for appetiser, very fresh seafood. The stone crab was cracked well enough for us to peel away the shell and devour the deliciousness! Best way to enjoy crustaceans is definitely with good ole lemon juice, there were plenty of lemon slices for us. Love and highly recommend both dishes!  Mains we ordered the Filet and Tail along with a seafood pasta dish, the past was pretty average in my opinion and bland. I needed to salt it quite often, I wouldn't recommend the pasta.   The filet and tail however was absolutely delicious, great portions of tail and filet and cooked to our liking of medium rare. Highly recommend the filet and tail!   I'd definitely be back for more next time I'm in Las Vegas, very happy with our meal and service!",

    "text": "Signature Item: Stone crab imported from Florida/Gulf Coast. They break one claw off and throw the rest of the crab back to regrow the claw so the harvesting is sustainable. They don't server other parts of the stone crab. The claws are very meaty compared to other species wiht a delicate sweetness unique and different from snow and dungeness. Stone crab claws paired with a Sancerre was a mind blowing experience. The flavors are different when chewing the crab with some Sancerre in the mouth at the same time. Changes the flavor of the crab. Excellent pairing. Without the wine pairing I wouldn't have enjoyed the crab. Cold crab claws with mayo based sauce wasn't that appealing to my palate. I echo what other reviews say about this.   Signature Item: Sole with browned butter. Reminds me of the burned butter taste in creme brulee without the sugary sweetness. Excellent sauce. Unique on fish. Never had it before Fantastic presentation. They have one person specially trained to debone the whole fish in front of you.  The server counts the bones to make sure they don't leave anything behind. Never seen this before.  I thought the sole was too salty. Couldn't eat it after a couple bites.   Signature Item: Key lime pie: very memorable. Ordered from the waiter's suggestion. The serve it ice cold so it doesn't melt. Almost like a custard or panne cotta in texture signature item. All about the texture. Must try. The tartness lingers and evolves as the custard is warmed up in your mouth.   Great experience. A lot cheaper than flying to Florida. I have a small understanding why this place is famous. Great people/service running the operation. Food may not appeal to all palates/styles. I can understand the variation in reviews. $150.00/person. Couldn't finish everything.",

Older, prob in his 60's Caucasian male. I cannot say enough to the level of customer service Troy is on. Listen, if the food was horrible I'd still come here because the customer service, again, is amazing. From the moment you walk I to the door until you exit you are treated with top caliber service. Highly recommend Joe's.",

Joes is located in the Forum Shop area of Cesar's Palace which we happened to have spent a lot of time in. I wanted to find an authentic fresh seafood restaurant for our last night in Vegas and Yelp helped guide the way. All of the positive reviews are spot on with food quality, service and ambiance. When we arrived the host commented on what a beautiful dress my fiancee was wearing (she had been getting looks all night). We were seated immediately for our 9 pm reservation. After careful consideration of the menu options we started with the half dozen oysters and a bottle of Red Spanish Wine. For dinner I ordered the seafood grilled platter which came with Madagascar shrimp, scallops, and lobster tails. My fiancee ordered the crab cakes that were just stuff with fresh crab. The sides Joes grilled tomatoes and the 4 Mac n cheese. Everything was outstanding, cooked and seasoned perfectly. We would have passed on dessert but they are known for their key lime pie and it was spot on. Crunchy graham cracker crust with the just the right amount of lime.  If you are in Vegas and looking to spend some dollars on great food, I highly recommend coming here. Just amazing!!",

    "text": "One of my top 5 Restaurants period. I always make it a priority to dine here when I'm in Vegas.   What I love about this place is that you can make it a casual affair or you can make it a special night to celebrate. I've gone in the evenings all gussied up for a romantic time. I've sat at the bar and relaxed from a day of working a convention. This time, I brought my 8 year old son and sat in the Forum Shops outdoor piazza area. I always have excellent food and service.  Food: They have a lovely bread basket of assorted rolls, bread slices, pretzels, crackers. c'est magnifique!  If they have it, always stone crab claws. Yes, they are frozen for shipment but still good. And you have to have their mustard sauce to accompany them. This last time they only had the large size. I only wanted a couple of claws and they were large for my appetizer.  If I'm there at lunch, I like to get their 3 course meals. They will usually have two choices - one with beef and another with seafood. I usually get seafood. This last time, they had King Crab Legs. OMG - so generous with the portions. It came with two huge sides of potato lyonnaise and roasted corn.   Finished with 1/2 slice of their delicious Havana pie. It reminds me of tres leches cake but with dulce de leche. one of my favorite desserts.  The kids meals are fabulous and at a great price!  Service: Always stellar  Ambiance: Can be romantic to very casual depending on where you're sitting.",

Joe's is no cheap date but their service is impeccable, their wait staff is not only professional but very polite, helpful and knowledgable!! Now let's get to the real part.  The food!! Their steaks (the boys both had filets) are always cooked to perfection and the girls last night we each had ahi steaks. Which were also some of the finest tuna steaks around and again cooked to perfection!! My ahi was more customized for a more Asian flare upon request and my friend had the tuna off the menu and both were excellent!! We also both shared salads (which is easy to do as their salads are huge) so for the table we had a Joe's chop and a regular chop salad and both were perfectly dressed and delicious! Martinis were excellent and not too tiny glasses and their wine selection is great as well. All in all a must is you have to eat in the strip in Vegas!  Oh and don't forget their pretzel bread. An absolute table favorite!!   You will never go wrong with Joe's!!! Oh and make a reservation! Apparently everyone else in Vegas also knows this is the best meal in town. As they are busy!! And rightfully so! Now go enjoy!!!",

Apparently people that visit here are wild about soggy croissants.   I was alone so I sat at the bar.  Asked for an entree and wine recommendation.  The bartender was super friendly (and nice to look at).  My food came out quickly.  I had fries, crab stuffed shrimp, and a glass of white wine.  It was absolutely amazing.  One of the best meals I've had in a long time.  And I live in San Francisco.  I have high standards when it comes to food.  To top it off I actually felt the price was a bargain with all things considered. At one point at lady sat next to me.  She was in a hurry.  And the bartender did everything in his control to accommodate her and get her out as quickly as possible.  He was so friendly and professional.   I honestly can't wait to come back to this place.  Hands down one of the highlights of my trip.  Thanks Joe's!",

Service was top notch all night.  My colleague really wanted some crab until he saw the prices, but it's Vegas so I wasn't too surprised. Usually the restaurants are very good and to some extent justify the higher prices. Our waiter confessed that the stone crab was not fresh too so in the end none of us had crab.  My colleagues had the Mahi Mahi which was a daily special and I went with a seafood salad. We split some sauteed spinach and onion rings as sides. The food was \"nice\" - I hate that adjective as its so non descriptive but so was the meal. It was hard to remember and was my most disappointing meal of the week.  We left room for dessert and I had the banana pie as recommended by our waiter. My colleagues had the key lime pie and apple pie too. The latter was way, way too big for one person but tasted good. The key lime and banana pie's were the highlight of the meal but that's not saying much. With all Vegas has to offer I wouldn't go back here in the future.",

It has been a corporate \"gift meal\" to high-performance employees and partners for the past 5-6 years.  Whether it's a light meal alone, with a partner, or with a group, Joe's Las Vegas never has failed to impress me. Patrick, Tim, Diane always seem to make it a experience vs merely a meal. I've discovered new wines and new foods here.  Always allow your server to select which stone crab you'll have. They generally know what's best on any given day.  I heartily recommend any of the bone-in steaks vs the standard steaks. Joe's specializes in bone-in. The Chilean sea bass is the only seafood I'll eat, and I was cajoled into trying it by Patrick at Joe's. As usual, he was right. I love it.  Sides: they're huge. Share them. My faves are the Sweet Potato with Maple Pecan sauce, Mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes with cheese, and asparagus.   Can't wait to return.",

Server charged me for two $20 appetizers because HE miscommunicated that only one crab came with the app portion  (I asked beforehand and he said two). When the app came out there's only one on the plate and I'm confused. So he apologizes for the miscommunication and brings us another crab cake, insinuating he will take care of the mistake and not charge us for the extra one. On top of that, he bought out a THIRD app, shrimp cocktail, to apologize for the mistake yet again, which we didn't ask for! When we get the bill we were charged $40 for the two crab cakes, even though it was his mistake for misspeaking about the portion size AND saying he'll \"just bring out another one\" without my consent! It was completely manipulating. Why not just comp the the crab cake, what was the point of bringing a free shrimp cocktail? This was the first time I ever wanted to tip someone ZERO dollars, although I still tipped $20. Just all around a not good experience. I had to ask three times for a straw, server was not engaged at all. And this is coming for a fellow server!! Steak was okay, kinda salty. Not a good experience at all. Not worth my time and money",

( at no additional charge ). Felt very VIP.  My group ordered filet steak, seafood cocktail, pasta and Stone crab claws of course! Everything was delicious! Crab claws were pricy but it's fine dining- what do you expect? Nice full hearty claws.   The staff were very pleasant and professional! Great recommendations on wine and brought me a huge birthday dessert ice cream treat to share among my friends  Definitely recommend if you win $$ from the slots ;) you won't be disappointed !",

We only ordered main entrees as we had appetizers at another place beforehand. The bread basket was a great way to start off a meal here. Great variety and glad butter is served room temperature.   Me and my colleague both got branzino. It was so good we devoured it. Great entree. The best entree that my other colleague got was their mixed seafood grill. I was so happy he gave me one of his scallops. From other reviews, I must say one of the best I've had.   The entrees ain't cheap ($32-$39 range) and it doesn't come with any sides. We got sweet corn and asparagus. The corn was so flavorful I've could have eaten the side dish on my own.   For dessert, we all split a banana cream pie. It was also probably the best one I've ever tasted too.  Great choice for people that want a good seafood place near Caesars and the Mirage.",

My personal favorite is the crab bisque made with King Crab.  We usually get the 1 1/2 lb. Of King crab legs which we prefer over the stone crabs. The steaks here are pretty lackluster and are served with a really salty mix that does nothing really for the steak.  As for drinks, espresso martini and cucumber martinis are some of our favorites.  Their 'wines by the glass' are great as well.... we usually enjoy their sparkling rose and the Sancerre they carry is my wife's favorite.",

For entree's, I ordered the grilled seafood platter and my friend ordered the filet. Both were very tasty and well prepared. We ordered the steamed asparagus and the grilled tomatoes as side dishes. The grilled tomatoes come with spinach and cheese on top, even though that's not listed on the menu. We were too stuffed to order dessert, which I was truly sad about, because I was dying to try their key lime pie. A truly excellent place to eat with a classy, old school feel. If you are trying to decide where to spend a nice night out in Vegas, add Joe's to the top of your list!",

Kind of dry and had lost a lot of the flavor and tenderness you expect from a properly cooked filet.  I didn't send it back since it had already taken a while and we had a show reservation after dinner.  I didn't want to risk the time.  The price is commensurate with any top-end steak house, but the result wasn't.  We also had some of their famous crabs and they were very good.  The claws were pre-cut enough to make it pretty easy to get the meat out.  Their mustard sauce for the crab was very good, though honestly I prefer them with just butter.  Service was very friendly, and she was really helpful on picking out menu items and her knowledge of the ingredients was perfect.  I don't think I'd try it again since for the price, I don't want to risk another blah over-cooked steak.",

    "text": "Decent service but good seafood and meat to satisfy your needs. Make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. I made reservations and though I was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. Be sure to use the Valet Parking where the Forum shop is near Las Vegas Blvd. Easier to navigate right to Joe's.   First came the free bread. None are the same and you get 5 different types to try. In my opinion, all were great. The one with sesame I liked the most. We started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, I've had better. We then ordered 7 Stone Crab claws to split with my wife. Great part about this is that they come cracked already and I definitely recommend getting it. Great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  For the main, I got their Bone-In Filet Mignon. Priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. Nice huge sized filet mignon that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. Bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which I don't think any of those do. You will have to order their sides separately. Good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. I recommend ordering the mashed potatoes. One of the best I've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. Place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. Service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad. Just that we waited for about 20-30 mins before our main dishes came out. I would probably come back again and try something else on their menu but can't go wrong with the bone-in filet mignon, stone crab claws and mash potato.",

We had a party of 6 to celebrate two people's 40th birthday.  5 of us had the bone in rib-eye and 1 person had the fish and chip.   All of us ordered the ribeye to be medium. We skipped the appetizers, and shared a number of sides: regular fries, sweet potato fries, creamed spinach, fried asparagus and a special corn side.   The rib eye was simply fantastic, as good as any top steakhouse in the country.   The sides were all great as well.  And the end of it, he gave the two of us having birthday a free dessert, which is large enough portion for everyone to share.  Our waiter was very efficient, attentive without being over bearing.

Hash brown was overly hyped by our waiter-- it was literally just a pile of potatoes and nothing special about it.  My ribeye was salty, but was cooked to medium rare just as requested. Saltiness was a little over bearing and disappointing.   I'm will definitely not return as there are far better steak and seafood places in Vegas.",

    "text": "Steak, Stone Crabs, and Bread!!!  You can't go wrong with Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab if steak, crab, and carbs is on your meal plan.  The gf and I came here for a Halloween dinner date.  This wasn't our original pick, but I'm glad we ended at Joe's for dinner.  From start to finish, the service was excellent.  We had reservations, which meant no wait.  Our orders were taken care of quick.  But most importantly, we were taken care of good.    Like most restaurants, we started with a bread basket.  Their mix of bread and carbs didn't have a chance. We killed every piece of bread in that basket.  Then there was our meals.  I had their Petite Filet Mignon, but this was not petite at all.  Here at Joe's, they do everything big. A petite filet here is 8 oz and cooked to my liking (medium-well).  The filet was tender, juicy, and so so good. I'm not stating that this is the best steak that I ever had, but it's still good enough for me to want to come back.  My gf had their Florida based Stone Crabs.  You know, the parrot beaks that you see on the billboards off our freeways.  I think she loved it because she finished her plate. For our sides, I got the mash potatoes and my gf got the mac n' cheese.  And of course she did.  The mash potatoes and mac n' cheese, like the bread, didn't have a chance.  Both were good and a must if you're having steak and crabs.   Overall (ie. long story short)...Joe's Seafood Prime Steak & Stone Crab has good steak, fresh crabs, and great service.  Prices are decent as well.   Parking Tip:  Valet at Joe's.  If you're going through the main Caesar's entrance, it's the first right after the Caesar's and Forum split.  Sure beats having to walk through the Forum Shops to get here.    PS:  I've been told that the Alaskan King Crab is the best at Joe's.  I have never been a huge Alaskan King Crab fan. But those that are, should give them a try.    YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (476/500)",

    "text": "For my 100th review, I figured I can't just write about anything.  I have to write about something life altering.  I needed to share with the rest of the world my experience at Joe's.    We begin the dinner with an appetizer of stone crabs.  If you have never eaten stone crabs before...think crab with a hint of sweetness.  The stone crabs are cracked, so you just have to peel away with ease and enjoy.  For our main entrees husband and I are all business and get steaks.  Please note that all menu items are a la carte, so any kind of side must be ordered seperately.  My husband opts for the ribeye cooked medium, and I get the filet mignon (also cooked medium).  I took one bite of my steak, closed my eyes, and I swear the restaurant went quiet. It was one of those moments. For our sides we share a serving of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach with garlic.  Both were very delicious and complimented the steak really well.  Lastly for dessert we were unsure of what to choose from because they had such a long list of pies.  Our waiter Ben suggested we share a slice of banana creme pie with fosters sauce (apparently his favorite).  Ben..if you are reading this review...you are a genius!  If I lived in Las Vegas I would be totally broke.  Not because I would gamble my savings away.  It would be because I would have a permanent seat at Joe's.  The food is on another level, and the service is incredible.  If you're ever in Vegas and want a real good meal without the Legassi or Flay name stamped onto it, dine at Joe's...you won't regret it.",

For the entree we had the rib eye with a baked sweet potato and I swear I could hear my taste  buds singing from joy!  Finally came the key lime pie which was truly the best I have ever had.  To top off the food the service was top notch!  In the end I left with a feeling of euphoria that stayed for hours.  I would totally come back and I would give a serious recommendation for anyone who wants to have a very nice meal while they're in Vegas.  Once again WOW!!",

Last time we had the fisherman's platter and rib-eye steak. Both were fantastic! The fried scallops and fried shrimp were amazing with the dipping sauce they give. The only thing that irritated me was the fact the waiter wasn't paying attention to our drinks. I like for a waiter to notice when I finish my drink so I can get another one. I guess it was a busy night so he was running around. However, he gave us two free desserts at the end. One was chocolate cake and the other was the key lime pie. The chocolate fudge cake was a bit too rich for me but the key lime pie was AMAZING! This is definitely a place to visit when you are in Vegas!",

I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fish tacos. The fish served with the fish and chips was horribly over cooked, there were 3 pieces of fish each weighed maybe an ounce each, they were full size pieces, just over cooked so badly that there was nothing left, the chips were just the standard steak fries that are served at about every nickel and dime restaurant across the country, nothing special. At $21.95 I expected something better than this. My wife said the fish tacos were just ok, there were 2 tacos and some broccoli, nothing special, you can get better at Applebee's or Denny's for about $8.00, we paid $17.95 at Joe's. Add in $3.50 each for a couple of iced teas and our bill came to $50.70 less tip. Bottom line: Joe's might be good for dinner, but if your looking for a good place for lunch, this isn't it.",

    "text": "I'm really not a crab lover, so my wife and I usually come here to satisfy her own unusual craving for crab. That said, we've been here three times now, and I think I'm finally beginning to understand the hype.  First - the service is great. To me, service is what makes or breaks a great dining experience. Even if the food is amazing, bad service can make you leave a restaurant feeling like it was terrible. That's not the case here. We're usually served by Brian (who was recently moved up to a somellier) - and he has been nothing short of helpful, friendly, and attentive. Honestly, my wife and I both waited our fair share of tables in our lives, and Brian has far exceeded what we consider \"good service\".   Ok - so the crab - I'll admit that while it took me a while to get into, I'm starting to love it. The mustard that it comes with is quite nice as well. Really yummy stuff, and it feels good to eat something so out-of-the-ordinary when we're in Vegas.  I've also had their Filet - which was, to my opinion, a little too much on the \"Pittsburgh\" style for my tastes. I know a lot of Yelpers like it, but it didn't blow me away. Super tasty, it's just a personal preference for cooking style.  I had the pork chop most recently - the portion was HUGE - like a dinosaur pork chop - really yummy stuff. We also had the crab cakes, which were epic - almost nothing but lump Blue Crab - delicious in ways I never thought crab could be.  Finally - the dessert - Brian recommended the Banana's Foster pie to us on our first visit nearly 6 months ago, and we haven't been able to find a better dessert anywhere ever since. I've read the key lime pie is great, but I honestly don't know how on earth you could top the Banana's Foster pie. Decadent, creamy, with a homemade caramel sauce on top - there aren't many better ways to end a night in Vegas (ok, maybe a few ;)).   Joe's has now become one of our Vegas staples - and for good reason.",

Compared to the Joe's Stone Crab at South Beach in Miami, Florida, this place has a lot more room for improvement.    The jumbo claws they serve is only as big as the large ones served in the Miami location, and their large stone crab claws may not even pass the medium size test by Miami's standard.  As for sweetness of the crab claw meat, there is no comparison between the two places.  The location in Miami beats this place hands down.  All in all, if you really crave for Stone Crab, then you could get yourself a quick fix here, but do not have your expectation set too high if you have already tried those jumbo stone crab claws in Florida.",

    "text": "Don't ever order the Dover Sole.  Joe's has been upselling that crap for years.  The reason why the waiters always recommend it is because Dover Sole is $6 per pound, and it represents their highest profit margin, selling it for $45 per plate.  Do yourself a favor and order a truly expensive piece of fish, crab, or steak.  Also don't ever order Stone Crab when it's not stone crab season !  If it's not stone crab season, then you'll enjoy frozen crap.  Stone crab season is between 15 OCT - 15 MAY.",

    "text": "We were looking for a good seafood place outside of the Mirage Hotel because the restarants at the hotel are terible and pricey.  I found Joes' on yelp, which is only a two minute walk from the Mirage inside the Forum Shops.  The food was amazing, even for Vegas standards.  We had the shrimp cocktail served on a bed of ice.  It came with four large shrimps and one of the best cocktail sauces I have ever had.  Perfect combination of spices..  The bread basket assortment was so good too, some sweet, some soft, some crunchy and some salty.    The main course I had the seabass with tomato confit.  It was awesome to say the least.  The side I had was the rice and the grilled tomatoes.  The tomaotes had a real rich and creamy cheddar cheese on top which was a little much for me, but most would probably like it.  And finally for desert we shared a boston cream pie.  Everything was fantastic and the service was top notch as well.  Greta was our server and she was very friendly and provided great table service.    Joe's will be a regular Vegas restaurant destination for us.",

    "text": "Upon arriving we were seated immediately. Because there was limited seating, my cousin and I were seated in the bar area which we didn't mind. We immediately received menus, and were ready to order within a few minutes. About 10 minutes later we gave the waiter our drink orders (a glass of wine and a Manhattan). It took 30 minutes to receive our drinks. By the time this happened, another table (party of 6) near us that arrived after we did had already received their drinks, bread, and had ordered appetizers. It took another 20 minutes for our bread to show up, and an additional 10 after that for our waiter to take our order. At that point we just paid the bill and left. As we were leaving the table seating 6 near us was already eating their appetizers. It's also important to note that we saw the waiter BS'ing with bartender multiple times during this experience. If anyone cares, he was a heavy-set fellow, with a goatee; avoid this man. I'm not a picky person when it comes to restaurants, but when in a city like Las Vegas in an upscale restaurant where I'm going to spend $60+, the service should be decent at least. The highlight was that they make a mean Manhattan.  TL;DR: It took a half hour for drinks and an hour just to order food. Tables in other sections were getting their food before we even ordered. We left the restaurant only with drinks but without eating. The Manhattan was good. Overall, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had.",

What can beat waiters in tuxedos with expedient at the ready service, spectacular king crab and oysters as well as killer deserts and an excellent wine list? Not much in this town! Love this place!! 5 stars doesn't do it justice!!!",

It started with our AMAZING server, Linda. Not only was she fricken hilarious, she made the perfect recommendations for what we were looking for with food and drink and also gave us tips on which clubs to go to and what to check out of the strip.  The food was phenomenal! You must get the stone crab!!! We wanted to keep it on the light side since we were going clubbing after. We split the stone crab, asparagus, Brussels sprouts and Joe Cobb Salad. It was perfect.   We will absolutely be making a stop back here next time we're in Vegas. And fingers crossed Linda will be our server again!",

    "text": "Overpriced bad food.  I had the pleasure of coordinatiing the office xmas party as did every year.  The firm decided to take the staff and their spouses to LV for the weekend.  I decided to book the dinner party at Joe's.  The photos on the website is oh so mouth-watering.  Everyone couldn't wait to taste the food.  We decided on a pre-fix menu.  Course 1:  The 2nd Mortgage It's probably the best course, but it was just so so.  It was a medley of 2 inch king crab legs, 1 jumbo shrimp, half of a very small lobster, and a ceviche of shrimp and scaIlop.  I am used to having at least 3 sauces with my seafood medley.  it came with just cocktail sauce.  Course 2:  Vegetable Chopped Salad A mix of celery, lettuce, cheese.....  it was flavorless.  Course 3:  filet mignon My was medium rare and hers was medium.  I came close to choking to death on the first bite bc it was so dry.  I decided to cut down the center and saw that it was red and not overcooked.  I started eating it from the inside.  It was dry and powdery with no beef flavor.  I left a third of it bc I couldn't take it anymore.  Her steak was dry and she left half uneaten.  The sides were mash and grille tomatos.  Both were mediocre.  Course 4:  Dessert After all that, I decided to play safe.  I got the chocolate fudge pie.  You can't go wrong with chocolate.  With that said, it was nothing to write home about.  She got the banana cream pie.  That was just okay.  I would not go here again.  I discourage anyone to go there.  At close to 80 bucks per person, I can eat a lot better than that.  I was so disappointed.  The staff will have to wait a year for me to make up to them.",

Great food and great service.  One of my favorite items here is the Madagascar Shrimp. This is a large (and I mean large) grilled shrimp and they have a delicious key lime ailoi sauce. This sauce with the shrimp is heavenly. That is until you try the Stone Crab and Joes 'secret' mustard sauce. This is one of the best combinations ever. The only thing I would say is make sure you get the 'Stone Crab' and not the 'Rock Crab' they tried to tell us it was the same thing and it's not. Besides that everything else we've tried is also good. Make sure you call ahead or use open table to get reservations. This place is always packed and that is for a reason. They are one of the best restaurants in the country.",

    "text": "This is, of course, an off-shoot of the famed Joe's Stone Crab of Miami Beach, FL. I had the pleasure of eating at the original establishment twice and the experience remains part of the rush I get whenever I ponder the concept of  \"fine dining.\"  The Las Vegas location is exceptional. The dining areas are upscale white table-clothed spaces with a clubby feel. You can go with a jacket or without and fit right in.  I had the famed stone crab for an appetizer. It was good, but I may have experienced a little chalky flavor/consistency at the extreme tips of the claws. I would attribute this to the fact that the height of stone crab season is January/February and I had my visit in April (frozen?).  For the entree I had salmon drizzled with a maple glaze that jumped off the menu at me immediately. (I never would have thought of maple on salmon). It was very interesting - and good - with the salmon cooked medium (perfect). The table shared hash browns (for which Joe's is also known - and rightly so) and corn.   Service was up to the standard you would expect. The staff is friendly, helpful and efficient.  This place is a little pricey - perfect for a special occasion (or expense account).",
