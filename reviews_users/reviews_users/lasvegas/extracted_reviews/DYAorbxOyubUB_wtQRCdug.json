I will definitely be back again ;) maybe at another point in the day.",

Update: 04.07.16 After multiple visits here, i will never again order anything after what happened last night. They served wrong drinks and I saw that these customers sipped and drank some of it and that same drinks were given to me. Exactly the same drinks! It was so disgusting. I assume they just changed the straw and the lid. Yuck. The hot drink was obviously consumed because it's not full anymore. After these drinks were given to me I told them that those are the same drinks that were given to the previous customer. No apologies, and just told me that they will make \"new\" drinks. But this time how would I really know that they really made new ones? Oh well, never again.",

I certainly enjoyed a sip of the Kyoto style coffee (it's a slow drip brew...therefore super strong). I asked for a mocha and added black coffee and I love it!  The drinks tend to be sweet/sugary... So I ask for half everything!   Madhouse coffee offers deserts and foods as well!  It's a cool vibe. You see a lot of street art when walking in. None are offensive but some are just very.. Strange to look at.   This is a 24hour place where people can also go to smoke Hookah. Which attracts people from different places/countries/cultures.",

I've tried coffee bean, cowgirl espresso, Starbucks, Dutch bros., etc. and have yet to have an iced vanilla latte as good as madhouse coffee. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and creaminess. They are a little pricey, but with food and coffee as good as theirs, it's completely worth it.",

No big deal, but the girl that waited on me seemed really annoyed that she had to stop cleaning and come and sell me a cup of coffee. Also I would recommend that they have a separate station to dress the coffee. I like to do it myself and asking for a coffee stirrer, Splenda, milk etc... seemed like it was too much for the staff and had there been other people in line they would have been annoyed as it would have increased their wait.

The coffe I received was kinda sour. So I asked lady on the front(her name was Alison) what kind of milk did they use? Was it a skim milk ? Alison showed me all her attitude to my question and made her face like I just offended her. So she said it was a whole milk. When I said that coffee tastes like sour and bittershe kept look at me with the same attitude on the beginning. When I start moving to leave the window she finally asked me\"do you want me to change it?\" It was too late already , so I answered \"no, I don't \", in a moment I heard like someone yelling \"you are f**king bi*ch!!\"( check back cameras to see who was so creative) I was in shock!! Really it SHOCKED me. I just bought a coffe and was not satisfied with it.. I came back to the window but no one come there. I was running behind to my work so I didn't go directly inside the cafe.. when i called by mentioned phone number the same lady pick up the phone and was talking to me. She didn't give me a chance to tell nothing.She was talking and yelling on me. And all the time she interrupted me. At the end she just hang up. I tried to find the owner of this establishment..Marco.  Hope he will read this post and realize what is going on in his business. It's a shame for owner to have employees like they are.  They offended me . Just because I didn't like the coffee they made for me.. Unfortunately i will not go there any more. And it's really sad. I really liked that place.",

    "text": "Had a Groupon Now special for a $3 artisan bread sandwich. Brought a tiramisu obsessed friend. We ordered the Gobbler, Nutella tiramisu, and a red velvet mocha (blended).  My only complaint... My mouth was bright red after that mocha. Was it worth it? YES. I don't like coffee at all, but this was delicious. The sandwich was much better than any of the other Turkey/cranberry sandwiches I've had around town; probably because of the delicious bread and the melted cheese. I contemplated ordering another one but didn't want to be a total pig about it.  The tiramisu was good and I'm not a fan of tiramisu. It had a little too much of the creamy stuff on it for my taste but it was still good and my friend was very happy with it. The service was good and helpful. Will be back for another sandwich!!!",

    "text": "I used to love this place. Madhouse was my go-to spot for pre work coffee. They used to have a set up where you would go buy a cup for coffee, then fill it yourself at the coffee bar area that had about 8 different choices of coffee. This is perfect for me because I am entirely too picky about my coffee. They usually had bold, mild, decaf, flavored, etc. My favorite was when they had the southern pecan flavored coffee out. Then you would take your coffee to the cream and sugar station to fix it how you like.  After my job location switched, I wasn't able to go very often. I'm not sure exactly when they changed their entire set up, but it's completely different now. I went in awhile ago and saw that they didn't have their coffees out so I ordered tried to order a decaf at the counter. They said they didn't have decaf. Um. No decaf coffee at a coffee house?? They said I could get a decaf americano. If I wanted an americano I would have ordered it. I ended just walking out shaking my head.  Then, about a week ago, I decided to give it another try. I was with my boyfriend and we happened to be passing by in the early afternoon. I asked them what coffees they had brewing. They had one coffee they could give me. ONE choice. Even Starbucks has more options and their coffee is awful. So I bought it, hoping it would be good. I start looking around for the cream and sugar station and it was nowhere to be found. The girl behind the counter told me they didn't have one so I had to stand at the ordering counter and tell the girl which sugar I wanted and how much cream, which she handed over to me. And then I stood there waiting for something to stir it with, because there was nary a stirring utensil to be found. I had to wait for the counter girl to come back to ask her to get me one. How does this not slow down the line on a busy day? No, I don't want you to put cream and sugar in for me, I want to do it myself because this is America, dammit. Anyway, it was super inconvenient that they don't have a system in place for this kind of thing. And the coffee was awful. And lukewarm. I hate dark brews, but that was all they had. My boyfriend got some fancy ass blended drink that was awful and tasted like ash flavored ice chunks. He had about two sips and threw it away. What a waste of $10 and 15 minutes.  I'm a straight coffee drinker. And this used to be the place to go for variety. Sadly, I won't be back, much like the southern pecan coffee.",

    "text": "TLDR: 24 hours. Has food and drinks. Moderately priced. Owner is pleasant and grateful. Employees friendly, but not necessarily competent. Sells hookah. Free wifi with purchase. Has a drive-thru. Takes credit. Uses square trade.   I've been going to this quaint little coffee shop for quite some time off and on for about 5 years. As you know, I do enjoy supporting my small business owners, so I'm happy to give my business to modest workers. I've met the owner several times now as each time he introduces himself to me. He appears grateful and humbled for any business and potential marketing that customers have to offer. I would describe him as eccentric and a definite night-owl. He enjoys what he does and he treats his employees with respect. He has even noticed when we post things to Instagram. A great person all-around.   Let's get to the drinks. The matcha tea latte is very good. It's a little pricey, but it's well worth the price. Since I'm cheap, I wouldn't get it but that shouldn't deter you from getting one. The Nutella Mocha and red velvet mocha is great hot or iced. Word of caution: really sweet, especially towards the end of the drink. Ask for a water cup. In fact, get some food to wash it down with. I recommend the island of capri or the 4 x 4.   Speaking of food, their macaroons are pretty good and so are their chocolate croissants, especially warmed up. As for cost, their food is also moderately priced. Hey, someone's gotta make money, right?  Everything or mostly everything is made on-location so you're getting the real deal.   Let me know what you think!",

Then he brings the iced coffee over and it was the worst iced coffee I've ever had. It was so watered down. It tasted like a cup of water with some sugar in it. It seemed like it was really old because he \"remade\" it very fast. I ask for the same thing at Starbucks and at Dutch Bros and it's always consistent. So I decided to go inside and ask them to remake it. The cashier just said \"Oh that's just how we make it\". Horrible customer service. Didn't even offer to make another one. You're better off getting coffee from the McDonald's down the street and will receive better service. Don't waste your time and pay for overpriced drinks at this place. The worst.",

I almost always get the Monkey Mocha or Mustachio, they are flavorful, filling, and pack a heavy caffeine punch once I've added some espresso shots.    I wish they made the drinks a little less sweet though, and some of the workers are even more heavy-handed with the syrups so the drinks aren't totally consistent.  The prices are a little high, although the drinks are also available in giant size.  The food is just so-so, overall.  The menu is kind of interesting for a coffeehouse but too bland for my taste.",

Service is really casual and friendly.  Workers seem like they're all buddies outside of work.    I think I'm also becoming what I eat... an Innocent Bystander.

    "text": "It looks cute. You only get free wifi if you order something, which is fine, I had planned on ordering a vegan treat but the vegan section was empty so I didn't get anything. I wanted the wifi, so I bought a tea- it was $3.75. Wifi or not, that's too much for a cup of tea. Then the login didn't even work on our iPad. Even the employee couldn't get it. So I wasted $3.75.  But the worst part, is that in the case, there were penis shaped chocolates with a sign that read \"Dicks made by lesbians\" What the heck is that all about? I'm not a prude but I didn't think that was really appropriate. I guess I didn't realize it was that kind of establishment. I'm glad I didn't have my 8 year old nephew with me who likes to read everything. I won't be returning here.",

We loved the impossible vegan burger it was delicious (sorry no photo, we were too excited to eat it) it tasted just like beef too, juicy and cooked perfectly! We had the walnut date salad with fresh mozzarella as well as a cold brew and coconut blended mocha! It was sooo good. Everyone who works there is kind and attentive. We enjoyed the decor as well. Defiantly will be be back!",

    "text": "Came down here based off recommendations from a couple of friends.  First, I'll start off with the service. It was give and take. Both guys up front were a little awkward, especially after offering some recommendations. Payment process was easy, and our food was brought to our table, which was nice.  Secondly, and most importantly: the food. I ordered a green tea with peach sweetener. The tea was very watered down and bitter. It didn't taste like it had any flavor: just tasted like water! After mulling over the menu after what seemed like forever, I made my choice, but was still unsure. I admire the quirky theme of this cafe, but the menu is all different styles and fonts: it's hard to read, so it's hard to make a decision. My OCD was going off from this one. Ultimately, I chose the rabbit habit sandwich with pesto, sun dried tomatoes, and lettuce. The sandwich was nice, but nothing special. I felt like I've had this sort of thing at many places, but there was no wow factor. Couldn't even stomach the whole sandwich.   Lastly, I'll leave this on a positive note about the atmosphere. This cafe is cute and quirky. People look like they're genuinely having fun. Seating is very sparse and close together, which is my only complaint about that.  Overall, Madhouse is just an average cafe. It has a very hipster vibe. But I was so outraged by the lack of anything that I left this place in a bad mood. When it comes down to it, I won't be coming back here.",

    "text": "Gibraltar Review  The Pour: They don't roast their own, according to the barista, but use Intelligentsia, which is fine. However, the milk was scorching hot (gibraltars should be much cooler) which negatively affects the taste of the milk, as well as the espresso. I had to wait over 5 minutes until the coffee was drinkable.  Service: Barista was friendly, but as mentioned above tragically over-steamed the milk.  Ambiance: Not particularly hipster, average coffeeshop vibe. Clean. Cool wall art.  Conclusion: To be honest, it was probably the worst coffee experience I've had at a craft coffee shop. I'd (grudgingly) be willing to go back to see if the drink I had was an anomaly or not.   About Me / Review Criteria: -I only review \"Third Wave\"/artisanal/craft coffee shops (whatever you want to call them) -Nobody gets a 1 or a 5 star rating until I've gone several times -Reviews can't be based on just a select group of baristas, they all have to be equally skilled, or at least must all have a minimum level of skill -My star ratings are solely based on the drink, never on food, ambiance, or if the barista is emo or snobby (because that would bring down more than 50% of the shops), although I do mention those in the review -I don't claim to be a trained coffee connoisseur -My reviews are generally based on gibraltar/cortados (or cappuccinos), not espresso or drip/pourover coffee",

If you are me, you head to the Mad House, and relax in peaceful bliss with a massive caffeinated drink! My choice is latte with almond milk but I encourage you to be more adventurous.   Plus, after flying for many hours, I'm usually a bit hungry having avoided the dreaded \"airplane food\". Problem solved! The sandwiches here are absolutely delicious, and available on your choice of three fresh baked rolls. Yum!  Finally, being a likely obvious first time customer, the service here was enthusiastic and friendly, helping us select from the varied menu! They brought our food out to us as we relaxed and surfed on free wifi (ask for the code after you spend a few bucks). Truly, we were lucky to find a spot to sit as this cool Oasis in Vegas was quite full, even at 1am on a Monday.",

(Hence the space between \"mad\" and \"house\"). Review... Same menu as mad house but this one is more extensive with a larger dessert selection and delicious sandwiches to choose from. They don't have my usual lox & bagel but they do have \"another cowbell\". Being a garlic fiend, I had to try.   Disclaimer: They have tv screens to coy you into ordering a five course meal. Just look away, you can fight the urge.   Back to it.. Cheddar, lettuce, tomato, garlic aioli with layered tender roast beef on focaccia was holy god good. Served on a cute cutting board too. Presentation A+ , sandwich A++ (insert Michael Scott reference here). I had it with a blended mad MAX instead of my usual mad COW. It's 9 pm and I'm feeling audacious. Blended coffee and chocolate covered expresso beans yum! This was the perfect savory meal. Rosemary in the focaccia and a mild bite from the chocolate expresso beans.. Can we all vote for madhouse to provide delivery??   Being open 24/7, I have a love/ hate relationship with this place. But mostly love. A must try and bring friends too. Nice patio area and cool art on the walls. I loved the spiritual bump signs.",

We always order through post mates or uber eats at work and I love the blended nutella. Definitely wakes me up for a 12 hour shift. However if I'm hungry or want dessert, I always get annoyed for paying for an over priced sandwich. The sandwiches are small, bland, and basic. If they were cheap it'd be fine but they are like 1/3 of the size of a subway sandwich and you're paying 9 to 12 bucks! I've had the bread pudding, creme brulee, and nutella creme brulee which were all disappointing. I definitely don't consider those creme brulee OR bread pudding, and I've had my fair share. I've tried so hard to like this place but the only thing I ever enjoy is that blended nutella white mocha. And that's only on nights I'm okay being diabetic.",

The baristas are working as fast as they can, they're super nice and efficient, but as a barista myself, I can say this shop is set up in a very dumb way. The baristas have to walk all over the store for cups, to ice, to their espresso maker... The owners to this place need to focus more on setting up their baristas for success and then this would be truly great and fast coffee.",

The Nutella drink was a bit watery for me upon the first sip, but when I got to the good stuff, it was indulging enough--although if I didn't know it was Nutella, I might not have guessed so. My roomie said something along the same lines about his red velvet drink. He couldn't exactly distinguish the red velvet flavor, but agreed he had an enjoyable drink. Overall good experience, and I would definitely like to sit down inside that artsy area with a book someday!",

Plus, the coffee is really tasty too.  I tried the famous \"Mad Cow\", a hazelnut latte, and it was delicious.  But, the items that were calling my name were the freshly baked/ made in-house desserts and pastries. I ordered the pumpkin tiramisu (which is probably a seasonal item), and not only was the serving very generous, it was fan-tas-tic.   The place is quite small, but a cozy and artistic atmosphere. There are colorful paintings and modern art to inspire and simply take in.  And like many Vegas establishments, it is open 24 hours a day.  It is nice to know that if I need a caffeine fix or have a late night craving for some awesome dessert, MadHouse will be there. Plus, there is a drive-thru, so I don't even have to get out of my PJs.",

I usually go with the Michael Jackson or a caramel macchiato with hemp or almond milk. I absolutely love that they give you dairy free options other than soy milk. Their monkey mocha is also super yummy as well. I usually have to grab a sweet treat along with my coffee. They have a gluten free double chocolate muffin that I am obsessed with. They warm it up so the chocolate is all gooey inside. I love their pine nut cookies and macarons too. My only complaint is that the macarons are way too overly dyed with food coloring. I've had dye get in my teeth before lol. Also, I really wish they had gluten free bread so I can order sandwiches, but other than that, I love this place! They are awesome and the service is always on point.",

Pulled up to the drive thru around 11pm, score for them being open 24/7, and ordered the red velvet mocha, medium, blended. That's it. My total was $6.74!! I thought this drink must come in a gold cup, but that was not the case. I liked the drink, but they used wayy too much dye and my tongue, teeth and lips were stained red. Not so much a problem at 11pm, but be forewarned if you happen to get this drink on your way to work or something, it stains! So the drink had a little but of a red velvet flavor, but nothing too distinct. It was mostly a sweet, red, blended drink. I would probably come back here because they have some interesting drinks that I want to try like the monkey mocha which is pb and banana, and the nutella white chocolate. Also I like to support local businesses.",

    "text": "What a fun place to grab some coffee. Basquiat on the walls, fresh goodies in the case, and some darn good coffee to boot.  My husband and I continued our LV coffee tour with a morning stop at Madhouse. I initially was just going to get their iced coffee but when I walked in and saw some people OOOing & AHHHing over their blended beverages, I had a change of heart.  The atmosphere was fun & funky. While the space was small, every square foot had strategically-placed personality pieces. I love that have the most random items for sale - like clove cigarettes and random candy items. Sweet touch.  I asked the two baristas what they recommend. They said the white chocolate nutella flavor and the monkey mocha ice blended drinks were the most popular. We obliged and ordered one of each.  The super sweet ladies brought our order out to us and whoa - we were amazed. These are not your mama's frappucinos... there was a distinct coffee flavor and a combination of flavors that rocked my world. I cannot pick a favorite between the two - they were both equally satisfying.  This is a place we are sure to come back to even if it's a pretty good distance from us. If their tiramisus and sandwiches are anything like their coffee, madhouse might be one of our favorite spots in the city.  I think it would be a pretentious assumption to think this is some gimmicky coffee house BUT that is thrown out the window once the 1st sip is taken.... this is the real deal and I want some more.",

This one is on DI and is 24 hours which really works out with my work schedule. I've brought a couple dates here for coffee and dessert, after the bar to sober up, but I'm a regular with Tiffany. Madhouse is a great place to unwind after work or get your day started. I usually order the iced green tea and the Ron Jeremy to munch on. Tiff gets the iced passion tea (non sweetened, because she's already sweet enough as she states) and the BLT. The sandwiches are amazing! A tad over priced, but yummy. The crowd here is very young and hip and the owner always showcases art on the walls that you can buy. I've fallen in love with this one painting of a masked monster standing over a maze, but I won't pay $2,500 for it lol. Overall I love this place, and will continue to be a regular here with Tiff.",

I've recently been hooked on The Very Charming Pig (black forest ham, bacon, swiss, and marscapone) on ciabatta... probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  I've had no issues getting custom orders (drinks and food) here and all of the employees and owners are very nice and accommodating.",

My obituary will show that I spent a not-insignificant fraction of my breathing hours studying or doing research in cafes, so getting a hookup like this on Yelp while randomly looking for a place to work in town is a huge win. I love MadHouse's aesthetic: It's grunge-artsy with weathered homages to famous street artists such as Keith Haring and Jean-Michael Basquiat. Even the bathroom is an exhibit (won't spoil it by adding photos--you need to check it out yourself).   And the coffee is outstanding as well. Their pourover is an Intelligentsia Coffee single origin which is well-worth the sticker price. If you're in the area, do check it out!",

Sometimes when I walk into a coffee shop I get overwhelmed at the menu because of all the different choices and substitutes and add ones that I can't even make a choice.  They have a good amount of choices that you can have hot, blended, or over ice.  They have milk substitutes such as coconut milk, almond milk, hemp milk, and soy milk.  They also have smoothies and teas.    Since it's kind of late in the day for me I went with the 24 oz passion fruit tea with added peach flavor.  It was refreshing!  It was the perfect amount of sweetness.    When I paid it asked if I wanted to join their rewards program and I did just as simple as adding my phone number.  The person at the cash registered explained that every time you visit and use the same card it will automatically give you a star when your total is $5 or more.  When you reach 13 stars you get a free sandwich!  Anything free is great!   I will definitely be coming back to try the blended red velvet!  Ohhhh by the way they also have Italian hot cocoa!!!",

Omg every time I go it's literally a 15-20 min wait, not even exaggerating, even when I'm the only one in the drive thru. And I swear the staff is always high or something.  But other than that I love the coffee and that it's different than most coffee places! The Monkey Mocha is my favorite - must try! I've yet to try the hookah there but it does looks like a chill place to hang out.  I live all the way by the M Resort and I drive this one because me and my boyfriend love getting coffee at 2am for no reason and the one nearest to me isn't 24/7  but I'll still make the trip to drive here!  Suggestion: Larger hot drink cups! And make Eastern location 24/7!   Other than that, this is one of my favorite place to get coffee.",

We came here just a little after midnight to grab our Red Velvet mocha, was not able to get his name but the guy behind the stand made our drink perfect. We are usually skeptical about ordering from here because our drinks often comes out tooo sweet but this time it was just right.  It's usually a packed house especially at night, they serve hookah sessions with limited flavors. Not to sure about the food though, we saw a few unproperly stored items which probably gave us a red flag but thats just us. Spacious parking area and wonderful customer service.",

The menu, which is posted on a blackboard above the register, is cute, but a bit too crowded. It makes it a little hard to read. They do have a pretty good variety of food and drinks though.  I've tried a couple of their mochas and lattes, and they're either too sweet or too watered down. The hot matcha and hot chai are pretty good even though they are really sweet. They're really thick and creamy, a classic comfort drink for the wintertime. The pour over is decent. The food is good, but a little pricey. I do like how they have plenty of vegan friendly options as far as drinks go.  All in all, definitely worth seeing, but nothing to write home about.",

They also have Vegan options which is great, because I'm Vegan and late night food is usually a extra challenge as a Vegan.  The reason why I'm giving them only 3 stars is because of two things:  1.  Prices are a bit high for both drinks and food.  There are definitely other places closeby where you can get more food for the money charged.    2.  I love getting salads at MadHouse but at least 3 x now they have messed up on my salad, rather than using Vegan cheese they've used real cheese.  These days it can be hard to tell dairy from vegan cheese, and the times I have accidentally had dairy cheese my stomach has suffered from it.

Coffee was lukewarm again, too much chocolate in first cup of coffee mocha, second cup was so so. I invited 2 friends to introduce to place..they said they make better coffee at home.  Our croissants were not very good either.  Sad. But reason for one star, all of us got diarreah after going there.  That's an issue  that has finished future business.",

And by that I mean arrogant , and truly a despicable human being that will treat his employees and customers like garbage because like I said he's arrogant . Seen him make an employee re use a cup that fell on the floor simply because he wants to save that 3 cents. Just an FYI that is not acceptable health code. Disgusting. Hope no ones supports this disgusting establishment. Once I tried my coffee they denied me a refund even though it was barley warm. All the employees are SCARED to do a refund or re make something because the owner is EXTREMELY cheap and will save money before providing GOOD/ DECENT service. They don't follow simple health codes yet people continue to go there because it seems trendy and everyone would rather follow a trend than support a decent business run by a decent person. Just a warning to hard working individuals. Put your money into a decent establishment. Not run by a man who will literally call his customers \"pigs\". Sorry but you Marco are the pig.",

I'm used to seeing big Chain coffee shops with drive thrus but never a cute, artsy, hole in the wall type shop like this before. *Insert clapping emoji*  Loved all the artwork that was for sale, and in all honestly if I wasn't headed straight to work I probably would've bought a couple of the pieces.  I got a blended Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Banana drink that was too die for. and I also got a scrambled egg, cheese and bacon croissant sandwich.  Everything was very good, my only complaint was that halfway through eating my sandwich i noticed the eggs were grey in color and that kind of ruined my appetite.   Over all I will definitely be returning even if only to buy some art pieces.",

If they didn't have a \"one hour of internets for $4 purchase\" thing I'd give them five stars.  Oh, what the hell, I can round up instead of down.  I was here five years ago when it had another name.  A little warm inside, but they must have massive A/C bills.  The house-made (nice to see someone that's careful enough to avoid the ubiquitous lie \"homemade\") \"Nutella-misu\" was interesting, but I'd have the tiramisu next time.  In Chicago or Minneapolis they'd have a solid four stars but in the great coffee desert that's Las Vegas I rate accordingly.  Also, they're really friendly and nice, though they didn't say much until I did.  Businesslike.",

    "text": "I worked at Starbucks for almost three years so for a while I've boycotted any coffee shop other than Starbucks, or if I did step foot in a non-Starbucks coffee shop, I critiqued everything...  Putting aside my biases...  I went with a friend around 8pm last Monday. Once you walk in, you are surrounded by the delicious scent of coffee & a chill vibe. The coffee shop is pretty small so all the seats in the cafe were occupied, but they do have a spacious patio area **good thing I'm a smoker :)**  I was eyeing the pastries the whole time we were standing in line and was VERY tempted to try one but couldn't decide which. Seriously they have some of the most unique-looking, almost delicate, pretty pastries that I'm sure if I were to pick any of them, they would live up or surpass my expectations. Maybe next time ;P But actually, everything from the mugs, books, decor, etc. was unique. It gave the place it's own spunk =)  Well since that was my first time there, I was browsing the menu above for a good few minutes. The barista asked me if there was anything in particular he could make me even if it wasn't on the menu. I absolutely LOVE iced green tea lattes at Starbucks & I guess at MadHouse he's never made it iced only hot because the matcha wouldn't melt correctly but he would try.   So I settled with a small Iced Soy Green Tea Latte. He took a couple minutes to make it only because he took the initiative to melt the matcha with a little hot water THEN mixing it with cold soy, then icing it. It was superb! Starbucks doesn't even melt it for customers first --they just put the matcha, milk, and ice in a shaker and mix it the best they can with chunks of unmixed matcha powder sitting on the bottom of the cup in the end. But I will say the small size here is the same price as a Venti at Starbucks, for all those that complain Starbucks is over-priced =P  Customer service is HUGE for me so I definitely give MadHouse props for being so customer-oriented. I loved that the barista did the best he could for me. I also loved that he offered to remake it or make me something else if it didn't meet up to par, though I assured him it was fantastic.   I will be visiting every so often :)",

Via drive through too, so its not like he recognizes me either. Anything we get from there taste great. Our order has only been wrong with him and we visit daily. As well as consistently assures that our order is right when it is wrong. The first time this happened we brushed it off figuring every one has their bad days but we tip always as well. He has nothing to complain about but his poor attitude and lack of respect for the customer knowing what they ordered. Ive been a loyal customer for 7 years and he is the only one who I've ever had an issue with. Fix your customer service or leave the customer service industry. If it weren't for the closest vegan coffee house I could go to I wouldn't return just due to his poor service.  Edited: just want to say the coffee, smoothies, and what ever we order is amazing. I guess the time i go there daily is when he is scheduled and its awful service from the beginning. other staff is amazing, welcoming, and on point. I will say five stars to the rest for not arguing that what I ordered was wrong when it was served to me.",

    "text": "Ordered: Iced-Blended White Mocha 16oz - $4.35 Iced Cafe Mocha on the rocks 24oz - $4.75 Truffle - .99  I had a $10 Groupon for Madhouse, so we went here to study. The place is painted orange and has random tribal style paintings on the walls and lamps. I don't care for the layout very much. All the tables are two seaters, so there is barely any room for your laptops and drinks (beware of knocking something over). There are only 6 tables. That sounds like a lot, but many people take up one table for themselves, so Don and I had to sit at the counter top area along the wall in very wobbly bar stools. We weren't greeted when we came in and no one helped us for about 5 minutes (2 of which was spent just looking at the menu and pastries). One of the girls came up and took my order. She was very friendly and suggested a I get a truffle when my total came up to just $9.10 and didn't charge me for the extra ten cents (truffle was .99). I'm guessing the wifi code must come on the receipts, but I wasn't given one so I didn't get a code. I went up to ask for the wifi code so Don and I could both use the internet, but was only given one card. When we both typed the code into our comps, it said only one can use it at a time, so I just let Don use it. I was just a little annoyed though because we were both customers, even if it was under the same purchase. I guess they're just overly protective of their wifi here. The drinks were very good though. I don't ever order blended beverages because they tend to be expensive and a little too fattening for my taste, but I decided to splurge since I had a Groupon and it's Thanksgiving week anyway ;) The blended iced mocha wasn't too sweet and tasted like it had a hint of hazelnut in it. It was perfectly blended (no ice chunks) and very refreshing. The truffle i picked out was Pralina con tartufo and it tasted just like Polveron! It didn't really strike me as a truffle, but I still enjoyed it and it was only 99 cents.  Overall, I wasn't very impressed with this place. Coffee shop layouts and ambiance are very important to me since I spend most of my time studying in them and I just didn't like the overall feel of this one. When we went in they were playing some sort of experimental shoegaze and it was a little too loud and distracting for my taste. The bright orange on the walls and furry lamp was also too loud, but I understand it's part of their \"Madhouse\" theme. Since the drinks are good, I was thinking it'd be nice to just sit outside if I ever come back, but only one of the tables outside is covered by an umbrella. The rest of them are all out in the sun, covered by nothing. If anything, I'd come back and use the drive-thru to order a drink and maybe a pastry, but this isn't the type of place I see myself going to so I could study or do work.   Tip *Make sure you really PULL the bathroom door closed before you lock it. Don thought he closed and locked the door...until he got walked in on by one of the baristas. Then he came out and they were all whispering, giggling, and looking at him.",

A large iced coffee is supposed to be 4.70. Time #1 the guy argued with me that it's 5.79... He thinks I didn't know he was adding his own tip and not telling me? What's worse is he was so flippant about it and quite frankly a brat. The second time I went through it was 5.70. Again, adding a tip without telling me. Let's be real I always tip a dollar anyway, but the fact that they are now doing this and lying about the price of coffee and then also doing it for personal gain is bs. I order the same thing every single time so the price shouldn't be changing. If I go inside and see the usual baristas who are awesome - it's always the same 4.70. Quit lying to me and trying to pull one over on me as well. If you question the price as well the cashier will just bald-face lie. I have no tolerance for that. Don't know if I'll ever go back. There are lots of other coffee joints in the area that will be checking out now.",

    "text": "There aren't a lot of smaller/mom and pop style coffee houses in Las Vegas (Compared to the Pac. NW where I'm from where is one on almost every corner) so Mad House is a nice choice if you want a break from Starbucks.   They have a ton of options and many more flavors than say Starbucks, which is great if you want to change it up. The reason I'm giving them three stars instead of more is the service. The people are friendly and all but they really, really, I mean REALLY, need some more training. Ordering there is a huge task and they mess up frequently. In fact, the only saving grace is the kids are the window are nice so it's hard to get super fed up with them always making mistakes.   My last two times there my order has been messed up. My second time there my order was messed up... it's happened several times.   They also don't seem to keen on the common coffee lingo. \"I want a medium iced-latte or a medium coconut latte\" usually turns into them asking a dozen questions just to get the order right. If I order an 'iced latte' they then ask, 'what flavor did you want?' 'you wanted that iced?'... last time I ordered a non-fat coconut latte I got 'so you want a latte with coconut syrup?'... um, yes, when someone orders a latte with a flavor, that means they want that flavor of syrup. Trying to order multiple drinks at once is even worse.   I would like to think the kids just haven't been trained that well, but it really makes me just want to hit Starbucks when ordering is such a hassle. But the coffee is good and they have a drive through window, which is nice in the morning on the way to work, but even that is loosing it's charm.  When I first went there, the drive through was quick. But that also seems to be slowing down. Not sure if it's due to, again, staff just isn't trained well and it takes them a long time to make the drinks, or if like this AM, the girl at the window was busy flirting with the guy in his car after handing him his drink. It's cool to be friendly, but when someone goes through a drive through, they are doing so to be quick. Not sit there for 10 minutes while you have a giggle session with the cute guy ordering coffee.   This place could be a go-to if they just fixed a few things.",

    "text": "Situated across the street from the sprawling Desert Breeze park off Desert Inn Road, MadHouse Coffee is certainly a spot to indulge in your coffee cravings.  The best part?  You can do it at any time.  This cozy little spot is open 24 hours a day and if you somehow happen to end up in the mood for one of their red velvet mochas or a \"More Cowbell\" sandwich at 3 a.m., then fret not, for your solution is down the road.  The Only downside? The second MadHouse spot, off of Eastern and Pebble stays open from 6 a.m. - 10 p.m., but that's still good enough for most.  The atmosphere of MadHouse certainly lives up to its namesake -- or at least the interior decorations do.  Ranging from bizarrely painted tables to hairy lampshades hanging from above and a very odd rendering of the Mona Lisa, even the hookah placed off on a shelf adds to it all. I'm only left wondering where the Cheshire cat has run off to.  The best part of MadHouse comes in the form of their decadently delicious drinks. I had the \"Monkey Mocha\", which is made up of a blend of peanut butter, banana and mocha, then topped with whipped cream and some chocolate syrup. Yes, it was just as perfect as it sounds.  Other indulgent offerings are on the menu as well, ranging from the red velvet mocha to the \"Mad Cow,\" a hazelnut latte.  Since the coffee shop also emphasizes its bakery and sandwich creations, I decided to give one a try and went with the \"Island of Capri.\" Featuring the wholesome goodness of focaccia bread, freshly sliced mozzarella, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and oregano, I suddenly felt like I was at some cafe off the coast of Italy, before looking out the window and remembering the sad truth  of, well, being stuck in Vegas.  While there isn't much space for studying, nor any tables fit for a large group study session, this is the perfect spot to quickly grab a drink (its drive-thru equipped!) at any time of day, and if you're hungry too, well, look no further.

One kid, who may have been new, made a few mistakes on my order and was frantically trying to correct them. This is acceptable.   Another kids, with a bully attitude, aggressively bossed the kid around. I tried to lighten the mood with \"Oh, he's just new, he'll get it\", the bossy brat got sarcastic with me. Handed me my coffee, and I said, \"Oh, is this the medium?\" He said \"I DON'T KNOW, I didn't take your order. \"  I gave up, got my crappy bagel and wrong size coffee, all of which I was over charged for, and left to draft this review. I waited a week to see if I'd get over it, but I'm not going back for a least a few Saturdays.  It's a decent place, the owner is nice and most of the staff is great. However, I have now had 3 experiences where a real brat employee treated me like my business wasn't worth his trouble.  See you again in March or so madhouse.",

There doesn't seem to be many people during the day, but this place is definitely popular at night. The music and people can be quite loud in there. So if you're planning to focus without really high noise, then I wouldn't recommend it.   I personally did not like how loud it got and how I felt like I was yelling to my friend sitting next to me. LOL but other than that, it is a really good place to catch up with friends like all cafes, especially if you're planning to stay there for the whole entire night because of their late hours!",

Looked at the bowl and it was like ashes from one coal. Whose fault was it ordering a hookah at a coffee shop, mine.   The drink I got was the Crushed Coconut Mocha which was fire and had what felt like those dried coconut and chocolate crunches.  Food I got was the Prosciutto which was done well with a green tomatoe and mozerella drizzled with vinaigrette.  Besides the bowl...this place is nice with it. Most def gonna try out more stuff espcially since they are open 24hrs and with a drive thru for all you lazy and lonely people like me.",

I walked up to the counter multiple times and they ignored me, would look me in the eye and not even ask what I needed... we ordered a hookah and they said they were \"looking for the flavor\" and they would bring it out to us, even though people outside already had hookahs, idk how they managed to lose the flavor. 30 minutes go by and we notice people after us had a hookah so we go in and ask and they say the found it so we pay then wait another 30 minutes, to which we go and ask how long and the guy just says the coals are still heating up... I'm like ok do you have an estimate on how long to which he says no, hes smiling at me the entire, but in a way that said I literally don't  give a crap about the fact that you've been waiting. there's no manager here. I think they just completely  forgot about us, just say that if you did. We all know it doesn't take 40 mins to heat up to coals. Honestly coming here gave me anxiety. The drinks are ok, very sugary. My friend said the burger was disgusting she had the day prior.",

When it was my turn to order, I stepped up and the male employee did not acknowledge me or even looked at me. He started a conversation with another male co-worker while getting the ladies order before me. He could have at least said \"I'll be right with you\" or something. I patiently waited until he was ready. He came up to take my order without even looking at me. I gave him my order and he was talking over me and I heard him say the order but was wrong. So I repeated the order and he said \"I got it I got it\".   While waiting for our order, I was talking to my husband and I told him how expensive two cups of coffee and two pastries. My husband asked for the receipt, but I usually don't ask for one specially when I pay for cash, to save on paper.  He did not even offer to give me a receipt.    Our order finally was ready. Lo and behold our order was too much. We usually don't say anything, but I wanted to make sure he knew that \"he didnt get it\".  Definitely not going back!",

They claimed that cappuccinos are traditionally prepared without foam and went on to describe the differences between a Starbucks cappuccino and a traditional cappuccino, condescending to me like I was some coffee-commoner. I asked them to make the cappuccino correctly with foam and they corrected me again.   ACTUALLY a cappuccino is traditionally 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk, and 1/3 wet foamed milk. The difference between a latte and a cappuccino is the milk content. Latte has a lot of milk, whereas cappuccino is a strong coffee\" They kept asking if I was confused and I wanted a latte with extra foam (uh a latte should have NO FOAM) which is not a cappuccino and that is what I ultimately received.  It's pretty pathetic that they don't know what a cappuccino is, and that they have the gaul to act like they do and correct customers.  The pistachio drink is full of some awful green syrup, artificially flavoured. They offer a lot of these sort of awful artificially flavoured frappuccino types drinks. If they were flavoured with real ingredients instead of cheap syrups I bet they'd be delicious! Their sandwiches are pretty good. Not a great quality of bread or meat. They're not great at getting orders right.",

A burger I wouldn't want to place in just my top Impossible Burgers category, because they served me one of the best burgers I've ever had period. The patty was cooked to perfection, had hand sliced tomatoes & vegan cheese, fresh arugula, with an incredible sauce that tasted like a garlic aioli on a perfectly home-baked bun. It was so good that we forgot about our drink which was actually heavenly, but that just goes to show how good this burger was! I'm still in awe as I'm driving away writing this review. All in all, I don't like Drake but, Top 5 Top 5 Top 5   Oh, also the fries slapped as well, all the employees were very nice, & if you rocking with the avocados like that, they do offer sliced avocado on the impossible burger!",

The venue gets quite cramped and stuffy with loud music inside...Patio outside is a rad place to relax with nice night air and great view facing Desert Inn Rd. They also provide hookah to chill out which is pretty creative.  I like how they incorporated pop art into details, including Recycled Propaganda you see at First Fridays. The shop also got a rich cultural undertone. Love how the owner is not afraid to speak his mind by introducing political views into art and coffee. That's what makes coffee tasteful, the cultural undertone and a daring challenge to spark great debate without fear.",

I ordered a breakfast crossaint and it was drowning in butter. I got cake here for my birthday and got stomach ache both times. The drinks are way too sweet. The to go cups look like lesbian porn. I'm not against gays the the imagine is very sexual and inappropriate. For the price id rather just go to Starbucks. It seemed like a cool spot with potential next to the park, open 24 hours and just after I get sick.  Here to your comment I tasted butter or some greasy let me rephrase that and yes you do have came unless you don't know your antilock tiramisu is cake. Also you are an extremely rude manager instead of apologizing or fixing things or rewriting your statement in a more professional manner I hope you go out of business. A good manager can take criticism or reply in a more appropriate way. I have nothing against gays most my friends are gay you can have girls holding hands or something geniune. It's cool you want to promote gays but the picture looks like they are porn stars which does look unprofessional. You most likely are a crackhead because you run a business and you are shit at it. :)",

If you are looking for a nice quite coffee shop this is not your place.  They had funky, upbeat music playing.  The decor is great for the place but could be loud and distracting if you're trying to focus on a book or work.  I wasn't there long but it seems like a great place to meet up with friends and enjoy the company paired with a wide variety of foods and drinks.  I had a Nutella white chocolate mocha blended drink.  It wasn't too bad, but definitely sweet.  If I didn't have diabetes, I do now! My friend got a regular coffee and carrot cake.  That was one of the best carrot cakes I have tried in years.   If you're looking for a new and fun place to try, take a step inside Madhouse coffee and enjoy the sites and sounds it has to offer.",

I believe I was accidentally overcharged since the burger should have only cost $13.99 + tax but we all make mistakes, right?   However, THAT is what a great business owner is all about, hence the reason for my new 4/5 star review. It seems he truly cares about the overall customer experience and wants to understand how to be better, I love that.   ***Original Review 3/5 Stars***  I drove 20 minutes out of my way to visit this place because I heard through the grape vine that they had the impossible burger here. I should have read most of the reviews about the price - eek!  PROS: + They carry the impossible burger + It was pretty tasty 3.5/5 + Non-vegan place with vegan options  CONS: - $18 for ONE impossible burger  - Out of my way (I live in Hender-tucky, ah-hem I mean Henderson) - Drive-thru lady overcharged me at first (seemed like an honest mistake) - Not that I need more fries but it only comes with like five lol  I always love when non-vegan places have vegan options so cudos to you for that; however, I definitely wouldn't go out of my way again for the impossible burger, especially when Vegenation is right around the corner.",

They even had a naked trump sitting on the counter in front of where you drink and eat.  Plus what kind of owner thinks its a tastefull decision to sell chocolate penis desserts in their display case?  It seems stupid to me owners will interject their business into politics when all you're looking to do is buy a quality product at a fair price.  I think a business owner can put any sign up he wants and make any political stands he wants.  I have no problem with that.

    "text": "This 24 hour coffee house has great potential but falls short where it matters, consistent quality of drinks and customer service.  Madhouse does offer a wide selection of non-dairy milks, great for people with allergies. I usually opt for coconut milk but they also have almond, hemp and of course the ubiquitous soy. These options are great to see and I wish more coffee shops would follow suit.  Prices for some items are a bit steep, something that would be perfectly acceptable if the quality was consistently high and service on point.  Unfortunately the dodgy employee training and high turnover rate here result in drink quality that is hit or miss at best and customer service that is essentially nonexistent.   My usual drink here for months has been a blended Matcha with coconut milk. When made properly it's excellent. When ordering at Madhouse the barista's do not usually repeat the order back to you to confirm, they simply say \"ok\" and start making your drinks. After getting several Matchas made with regular milk when I ordered coconut milk (and paid the upcharge for it), I started asking the person who made the drink if they used coconut milk before accepting it. After I started asking I found that they used regular milk by mistake more than half the time. If you get the wrong milk the drink has to be remade and it's done in a hurry. Every time that I've had drinks remade here they are not properly blended until smooth, filled with obnoxious chunks of ice.  After getting three drinks in a row on three separate visits made with the wrong milk by mistake and then remade without being properly blended, I decided to go back and raise the issue with management.  My last drink at madhouse was a blended matcha that I was unable to drink because it had large chunks of ice that got stuck in the straw every time I tried to take a drink. I happened to get the drink at the drive through on a Friday morning with some friends on our way out of town for a road trip. After already holding everyone up by getting my drink remade due to the wrong milk being used by mistake, I wasn't about to drive back and have them re-blend it yet again. Instead, I went back with my receipt on the following Monday when I was back in Vegas to see if I could get a replacement. I was told by \"Ricky\" who claimed to be an owner (I have no idea if he really was) that there was nothing they could do. He said that if they replaced drinks with just a receipt that everyone would take advantage of it to get free drinks. Maybe some people would do that, but what about the rest of us? This kind of policy will just alienate their paying customers whenever they encounter a problem and have a legitimate complaint.  With better employee training and a more customer-centric approach to service, this would be a great little coffee shop. As is, Madhouse is probably best avoided, especially if you have dairy allergies. I'll be making my matchas at home now and saving the $11 I was normally paying to Madhouse for them so regularly. Shame.",

They are individuals who speak freely, wear their own clothes, and are permitted to wear there piercings and hair how they like---though it is a 'madhouse' it's never excessively wild. I find it entertaining when a car comes through the drive thru and one of the guys puts on a silly voice for the customer on the other end. It is all good fun--- Marco, the owner is Genovese and his northern Italian styles have proved he is savvy in coffee, music, decor, and more importantly; business. He has hired a great staff. The girls are all cute and sweet. The guys are all friendly and hard working. Though the girls work harder :) Several of them are getting good at following Marcos expectation of \"Latte Art\"  Looser and tastier than Starbucks, (the closest Starbucks is inside of a Grocery store) Madhouse is quaint and available. The drive thru is quick. The table arrangement is comfy and flowing.. I never feel boxed in when I am in the dining room. The patio is also a nice place to relax. The occasional rush of cars west or eastbound on DI generally leaves more silence around than traffic noise. Basking in the sun overlooking Desert Breeze Soccer Park, sometimes a hookah bowl might help to pepper a warm moment.",

This place is cute, crafts some great coffee & tea beverages, knowledgeable staff, and some fun/tasty food.  I was here for the CMYE and enjoyed a cup of basic coffee & an almond croissant.  The coffee was strong but medium in character, which is good for the \"house\" coffee.  The barista asked if I needed room for cream; always good.  The croissant was almost perfection: flaky, lightly sweet, buttery, & with good almond flavor without being overpowering.  FYI, my benchmark is the almond croissant from the Orange Inn in Laguna Beach.    I believe there is free WiFi, but that may now be de rigueur in most coffee shops.  Marco, the owner, is very friendly & pleasant & works nights (mostly).    This may be my new 4am drive thru spot if I continue this downward spiral of staying out late on school nights.  If you're in the neighborhood, it is late, and you come across all peckish, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

I got the Green Card on ciabatta, and my wife got The Madhouse on focaccia. They were both pretty decent. My wife also got a Mad Max blended coffee drink which was quite tasty.  It's a pretty small place and the seats are only moderately comfortable. However, I like the interior and the workers were very friendly. They have a selection of several board games as well.",

Yes, the prices are on the high end of the spectrum, but they're totally worth it.   Why two stars you ask?  I loved this place so much, I decided that I wanted to work here. I thought I was hired when I was asked to come in to start training. Three days of training for two hours went by. After the third day, nobody told me when to come in again. What ruined the whole thing for me was how I felt so out of place from the rest of the baristas. I asked twice without a reply when to come in without receiving a response until a week later. Without letting me finish my training, I was let go. Very unprofessional.  They claim to care so much about their customers. At the end of the day, we're all customers, whether we're employed by them or not. I'm not coming back here.",

There are only a few things that didn't go so well.they messed up 3 things on our order all of which were fixed as soon as they were told, there was no high chair, & my friend said the chicken in the sandwich she ordered tasted & had the texture of pre-made frozen chicken. For the price of the sandwiches the chicken should have been fresh in my opinion. The last thing to happen is, we were given the wrong sandwich, when the server realized what he did after going back inside the cafe, he came out and grabbed it from my table, apologized and took it to the correct table. I had not touched the sandwich yet, but he did not know that because he went back inside. I would have been upset if I was the other customer getting the sandwich. All in all service needs a little work but, I will defiantly go back for the coffee it's seriously delicious!",

After ordering an iced coffee (we were presented with large and medium as choices), a red velvet mocha iced in small, an egg cheddar and sausage croissant and a chocolate croissant.... And paying $20 bucks.... I'm going to have to file this under \"when I have too much money to spend on a big coffee and small breakfast\"  Everything was delicious, employees were friendly, good atmosphere... But man, we were shocked by the 20 bucks. I guess it probably almost on par with Starbucks, but they're quite brilliant at not offering up the prices on the food. All food items don't have prices, whereas in Starbucks you can purposely avoid crazily prices items. We thought, how much could this be? Our jaw dropped at $20, and with the iPad they use for checkout, no receipt was provided... Too bad. (I later found out my girlfriend accidentally chose the \"no receipt\" button when choosing options on the iPad).  Could have asked separately for the receipt, but we were still sticker shocked and just walked away.   If you have the money, want to pay Starbucks like prices for some better specialty drinks, and don't mind paying a lot for small amounts of pretty good food, this is your place!  Like Starbucks, I'm sure if you come in and keep it mega basic like a coffee and a muffin, you'll be alright, but what was I thinking agreeing to a hot egg sandwich?!  My biggest drawback, and why I give this 3 instead of 4 stars, is the VALUE of the place. We spent 20 some bucks at Babystacks Cafe and got a huge breakfast with unlimited coffee refills. Delicious pancakes, a server to take care of us, all for similar price as madhouse. Even worse, at the German Bread Bakery, we got double the food with a coffee and spent more than 60% less than at Madhouse. For awesome quality pastries.   I just can't justify spending this amount on coffee and small sandwiches. Also, we spent 20 bucks and got a voucher for 2 hours on wifi... I thought ok great, girlfriend put it in her iPhone to skype with her family, and I went to put it in mine... And apparently one user was all it was good for. I probably could have asked for another code, but why so stingy on wifi?",

    "text": "REVIEW UPDATE:  (Typing fast. Apologies for grammar)   -why is every negative review (143 to be precise) under the \"Reviews Not Currently Recommended\" section? Are businesses able to pay for this?-   The owners of this place need to provide their contact information (an email, etc.) I just spent 14 minutes in the drive through for a cup of coffee. Clearly, the only thing they care about is profit and not the quality of their service. This is unreal. If I could have, I would have left the drive through but I was stuck in between cars and now, because of your absolutely shite slow service, I am later for work. What exactly do you plan on doing for your EVERY DAY customers for this inconvenience? These delays are not isolations; they are every day issues. Even your employees do not care to apologize because as the gentleman said: \"I ask for help every day and they just ignore me. Sometimes I am here by myself. Talk to Rose.\" Well, ROSE, for the money we throw on the $5 coffees and $9 croissants here, you can afford to hire another person!   WHY are your employees taking Uber orders when the have a drive through full of angry customers already?  By the way, if you can't tell, I'm PISSED off and I am especially pissed off that I managed to sleep 2 hours, leave for work 15 min earlier than usual and now be late. I come to Madhouse almost ever my morning and this was my last.   Original Review:  Admittedly, the 1 star is not for the quality but for the service, rather. It is just WAY TOO SLOW. I come here way too often and know it's not just an isolated incident here or there on busy day. It's slow on slow days! There is just no sense of urgency it seems like or perhaps the owner needs to put more people on during rush hours.   Also, the prices are just outrageous. One size latte or cappuccino is $5 and $7 for a breakfast item. Those are Strip prices. Granted, every now and then they send a $5 coupon.   I love the staff and the quality but I just dread waiting at that window and my bill.",

Americano coffee for him. - The drinks hit the spot. - Funky little coffee house at Desert Inn and Durango in the Von's shopping plaza. - They have hookahs here! - Keith Haring theme is kinda retro and very cool. - I'll be back to try the \"Michael Jackson\" drink:  white chocolate and regular chocolate coffee drink. - I'm a fan of the red velvet mocha.",

    "text": "Delightful little coffee house- get your caffeine and sugar fix here, 24/7, complete with free wifi. Fairly creative coffee offerings, pastries and desserts made in-house, cheerful and friendly staff, and great music.  Decor is colorful and welcoming, lots of patrons sitting around using the wifi with their various devices. Would feel comfortable coming here on a weekend to get some grading or lesson planning out of the way, but I imagine it may be difficult to find a seat sometimes- seems to be a popular place and it's a bit small.  Went for the red velvet mocha- tasty and unique but a bit too sweet for me. Raided the dessert case and snagged 3 different macarons and (at BF's insistence) a small order of the tira-mousse. The macarons were large and perfect, and I really appreciated the bright colors and variety of flavors- green tea machta, white chocolate raspberry, and mint chocolate chip, in order of preference. Kind of a sugar overkill for me, could not have more than a nibble of each but really liked what I had. The tira-mousse was too much. I didn't like the texture or flavor, but BF and his friend really liked it and could have had more.   Though I liked this place, I'm not big on sugar or caffeine, and found this place a little pricey- for the above order, with a moderate tip, came to over $20. Ouch.",

Even the staff seemed to fit the mood. They were nice enough but not super friendly.   The matcha green tea blended was good, tasted like green tea ice cream which I love. My fiance's monkey mocha was very flavorful and a nice blend of chocolate, peanut butter and bananas. Though it was good I did think it was pretty pricey. Two 16 oz. drinks for almost $13. A bit much in my book.",

Wifi isn't convenient - have to get an Internet card with a time limit, based on dollar amount spent. Sometimes they add a key to the bathrooms and sometimes the music is straight bass. I've always assumed they were trying to make it less accommodating so people don't stay too long. We don't have many coffee spots 24/7 in Vegas - esp not good coffee... so I tend find myself back at Madhouse when Sambalatte is closed. I've been coming here for over 10 years, back when it was an It's A Grind without the odd decor and the loads of people. Writing a review now because they'll give me 50% off my next coffee and I want a next coffee.",

Usually I have a VERY hard time studying in public places, and I stay away from parking at coffee shops for hours on end. Madhouse has a great vibe, and everything about the shop is just right.  I also never order blended drinks, but Madhouse has THE BEST blended Nutella drink on the menu, so it's hard to be \"good\" and not order it. My friends all ordered food, and for a small coffee shop, I was super impressed with the presentation and how tasty everything was.   The only thing that I don't like is that you have to keep asking for a new wifi password every two hours. I'm bummed that I didn't find this place at the beginning of the school year!!",

At beginning I can tell he employee was bit annoyed by our presence(how I can tell? From my one of my line of work as hiring behavioral assessment) I hd a feeling this one is going for an argument later for some oddly reason. (Keep reading...)  After the coffee comes in paper cups.. I was kind of wonder did't we ask for the ceramic cup? We kind of just let it slide this time. Later, since pastries never really show, we went to the counter and pick them up ourself  shortly later my partner asked for plastic cutlery and napkins, the employee went and accusing my partner been wrongfully and rudely asking for it!  If I am not mistaken this is a food and beverage establishment?! And asking for plastic cutlery is been rude to employee like \"Do you hv silverware and napkins?\"  The employee went fully engaged with my partner. Saying something about we hv to be nice to him because he is serving us!?   I told my parent let's go and leave and never come back here and not forget to let the world knows what hd happen here.   All and all, pastries were good, coffee is bit on the warm side but good, customer service is a zero or negative. Table service? got a bit of it.   The employee never brought us the food other than two paper cups coffee which we did request ceramic cup he agreed during the order and forgot during the delivery.   For the quality of pastries , I might consider go back for it. For quality of services of any kind, I don't think I ever go back nor recommend anyone to experience the level of customer service that my partner and I received today.",

This place used to be my favorite place to get coffee and a quick bite to eat but recently my experience with them hasn't been the best. Whenever I go through the drive through it seems like they do not listen when you are ordering and make you repeat the order at the window more than once because they seemingly can't understand it the first time. I went to madhouse recently and the girl at the window got our order mixed up even though we repeated it like three times. She gave us ALOT of attitude when we told her and said \"I guess I'll remake it\" with a lot of attitude. I do not know where they hire these people but they definitely do not belong in customer service.",

All I have to say is her customer service needs to be worked on. She couldn't remember which drink was which, and threw one of sandwiches in the trash so we had to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for our other sandwich. Then as we drove away we realized we never got our card back, so when I called, she hung up with, \"K bye.\" These might not seem like a big deal, but when you work in the hospitality industry, the little things matter. And all of these were very annoying. They definitely need to work on their customer service skills a little more.",

The food is delicious and the drinks are superb and the people are absolutely wonderful, and unbelievably sweet. The owner is an absolute sweetheart and loves his customers.  I couldn't love the atmosphere here more. Between the music, the people, and the beautiful art they feature, it's the perfect spot to just sit for hours. It's completely unique and refreshing, and being here is a relaxing experience.  The Japanese matcha green tea smoothie is my favorite, and I order it every time. Every sandwich on the menus is delicious, but I have a soft spot for their Tiramisu and French macaroons. It's open 24/7, perfect for late night cramming or a night out with friends. Everyone that I've brought here loves it. This is my go-to spot, and has been for about 2 years now.",

    "text": "Formerly known as It's A Grind Coffee, the MadHouse Coffee shop has a ring to it's name and if it does to you as well, it doesn't mean you're clinically insane, it just means that you heard what I heard when it was mentioned it was under new management. We're told never to judge a book by it's cover, even if it's good or bad, but what's the reality of things? We always do. For MHC's sake, I judged it by it's cover (the front of the store) and thought it to be a real chill spot to share caffeine with some friends, chat, and let time pass with smiles and laughter! There's even a little game (courtesy of Irish G.) that you can use as an icebreaker too, but I'll get to that in a little later...  When MHC was IAGC, I had their chai tea latte and it was a pleasant cup of spice! Glad to say that it hasn't changed along with the name.  Miriam C. and I enjoyed a chai tea latte a late evening some moons ago (open really late! get the schedule here: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheMadHouseCoffee%3Fsk%3Dinfo&s=fc435945be665554ce08b0f2111e683e7b0c108ea62589a2c35f06b402b48d05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/TheMadHouse...</a>, their website is down) and it was the same spicy chai tea latte that I got the last time I was there.  There are a ton of new things inside the coffee house like mugs for purchase and board games to complete this coffee house jubilee! Unfortunately, their website is down so I'm unable to post their current menu. The space is a smidgen too tight for huge groups to come and kick it, but the patio is equipped with chairs and tables to occupy, but majority of the time it's crowded. Free during the winter to freeze your toots off though!  I've enjoyed spending a few hours galavanting here and look forward to more occasions to come back! The coffee house has a real artsy feel to it with original paintings on the walls and tables which authenticates it as a real \"hip\" joint to be at. With the new management's changes, MHC has some potential to be \"hipper\" than the downtown coffee houses that's been springing up like gophers in the spring if they can provide entertainment there. I think that would brand it as the hippest coffee shoppe off the strip! Oh, and about that little game...  Irish G. noticed there are a few crowns hidden all over the coffee shop in the paintings, on the furniture, EVERYWHERE! I believe she counted 4, but I counted 6! Can you beat 6? I'll be back for another unique cup of whatever's brewin' at The MHC shop soon!",

It's also pretty cool that you can experiment with menu options and order online, although I do wish that they would include nutritional information. (The one thing I prefer about Starbucks is that I know approximately how many calories I'm consuming with each order, because their website has a nutritional calculator.)   The drinks are good. There's a lot of variety, including some pretty unique options that you can't find elsewhere. I also appreciate that they carry almond milk, since most other coffee shops don't.   The selection of pastries seems pretty standard.   I wish they had more seating. But aside from that, I think this is a pretty cool place (and, hey, there's always the drive thru...).",

The seating area is smaller but they have a decent sized outdoor patio area. I love their selection of drinks and usually bounce around between their Red Velvet, Grasshopper, and Monkey Mocha drinks. They have a good selection of sandwiches, muffins, and a couple desserts. I just love the vibe in this place and of course, there is free WIFI available. The staff is friendly and they do a great job maintaining the cleanliness of the shop. This place does tend to get busy towards the evening when they break out the hookah. It's a great place for me to come in the mornings and work from my laptop for a couple hours and have a drink along with a muffin.",

    "text": "I'm not in the mood for bitter invective, ad hominem attacks or sporting a split bill between Juvenalian bathos and a sustained coloratura soprano of high brow.  The espresso I ordered was not only sour, but also very acidic. I'm not a scientist, but I'd place the pH level between hydrochloric acid and the battery variety.   Upon reaching my lips I was obliged to not recognize it as any form of liquid suitable for human consumption. My appetite became permanently dead as the horrid filth sifted through my mouth and proceeded down my gullet.  To simulate my ordeal simply imagine this: you are about to vomit, a teaser dose comes lurching out of your esophagus so fast that the epiglottal warning consonant fails to sound and you are forced to swallow (perhaps you're in good company and wish not to embarrass yourself). That taste and that feeling is the Madhouse espresso experience.  So let's say you don't really drink coffee, and you're more into supporting mom and pop businesses just because it's not an evil corporate giant. Fair enough.  The owner was walking around barefoot that night. Last year I saw the man, Marco is his name, dusting an unboxed loaf of panettone with powdered sugar and the fugitive dandruff flake or two. I don't fault a man for accidents, but please, do not give Intelligentsia Coffee a bad reputation, hire some competent workers and upkeep your machines on a regular basis.  The macarons are delicious, however, though not without some Head and Shoulders.",

I tried to do this for Madhouse, but their website didn't work.   -1 Star: When I pulled up to the drive thru, their menu is posted so high up, that I actually could barely read the first few items from my car.  I had my head out the window.  When the guy asked for my order, I asked about the red velvet mocha. (apparently it was at the top of the menu, in which I couldn't see).  I asked for a medium with no whipped cream.  I think the total was $6 something.  Out comes this ginormous red blood coffee drink with a bunch of whipped cream.  Whatevs.  I drank it and it was DELICIOUS!  It's like eating a red velvet cake in liquid format.  Sooooo good!  This was definitely more like dessert  than a coffee drink.  I won't take a star off for this, but the red coloring dyes your teeth red.  So before you go to a meeting after drinking this, swig down some water or brush your teeth, otherwise you might look like you've been sucking blood all day.   If I want a dessert with some caffeine, I will definitely head back for the red velvet mocha.  The drive thru peeps were nice too!",

They use coconut coals which is good but I feel like if they got an $80 Khalil Mamoon instead of a $40 one, this would be a 5/5 instead of a 3/5. You're going to get people who don't know anything about hookah, and people who know very much so it's nice to have at least one or two nice hookahs there, just for those people. $13 for a bowl is ridiculous when it's coming from a crappy hookah. I can't even enjoy it. Also, instead of wrapping it in foil which just isolates the heat and makes it hard real easily, they should get net cages so that way if it drops, it wont go every where and it won't get so harsh. You can tell the owner doesn't know anything about hookah and it's not a good move in their part if they're selling it. I'll be back, but not for the hookah.",

LOL! the drive-thru takes a LONGGG time though & I was the only car in it. So if you plan on getting a quick coffee before work, you might wanna leave your house a little early.  Overall it's all an alright place. So if you have the money to pay for overpriced coffee & you enjoy \"know it all\" hipsters then this is the place for you!

    "text": "Drink prices are a bit higher here than at other coffee locations in town. Their blended drink menu was impressive and pretty tempting but my friend and I needed a caffeine boost so we stuck with lattes instead. We were greeted with a what's up by one of the workers and then we proceeded to order a medium green tea latte with an added shot of espresso (our current favorite drink) & a medium hazelnut latte with one less pump of sweetener. The green tea latte came out to be around $6.50-7 and the hazelnut latte was about $5.   I liked how drinks are brought out to you. There were a bunch of people sitting outside and their food and drinks were brought out to them. Some people were studying inside but I felt that the music was too loud and it was too dark.   2/5: The green tea latte was ok, it lacked a strong matcha flavor in my opinion but wasn't overly sweet like other places I've been to. My friend said that this drink was a lot better at Starbucks... and I had to agree with her.  1/5: hazelnut latte. Not sure if it's because I ordered it less sweet, but it almost had no flavor. I felt like I was drinking hot milk with a hint of sugar. The espresso shots (not sure how many they put in a medium) wasn't aromatic, smooth or strong. I was extremely disappointed.   I think I saw a few cars in their drive through so it's nice that they have that option. There were about 4-5 people working and they all seemed pretty busy. I also saw that they had some baked goods available for sale but their macaron was really cracked but it was still on display. I liked how a worker gave a patrons dog a treat.   Although it's a far drive and I probably won't be ordering anymore lattes here in the future, their blended drinks look promising.",

It's too much for me, but at least you've got options.  4. Fantastic baked goods/desserts. 5. Open 24/7. 6. They occasionally send coupons via e-mail.  7. Cool vibe/environment. 8. Super speedy service at night. 9. Free wi-fi. It seems like the majority of people come here to work.   Cons:  1. Really expensive. I buy Starbucks every day, and this place is too rich even for my blood. I mostly only visit at night when everything else is closed.  2. If you do go during the day, especially through the drive-thru, the service can be super slow. I suspect the owner is there at night and keeps everyone on their toes. 3. I don't love the sandwiches.   Highly recommend: Red Velvet Latte or Matcha Latte/Frappe   Overall, I think this is a great coffee joint, but it's just too expensive to be a daily habit for me.",

The large is HUGE, so it definitely will last you a while. It is 100x tastier than Starbucks's passion tea, especially with a pump of mango sweetener!  Also, their coffee is pretty decent too. I would recommend the drip blend (Ethiopian). It's absolutely delicious! I would say Madhouse brews some of the best coffee in Vegas.   The service here is always good. The people who work here are really friendly and personable. Plus, whenever my dogs come with me in the drive thru, the people taking my order always give them treats!",

In my opinion, the Grasshopper (mint & mocha) was pretty good, Mad Max was too bitter and I didn't get a jolt from eating the coffee beans, and the Monkey Mocha was good (the first time) with lots of banana and peanut butter flavors mixed in with the mocha.  Buuuttt the next few subsequent orders of the Monkey Mocha just tasted like mocha and ice.  I think $8  for a medium (plus a tip is encouraged by the jar and space on the cc payment system) is just too much.  Also, be advised even though they have healthy desserts, they don't use real ingredients like banana in the Monkey Mocha... it's all syrups which I confirmed with the barista.  Unfortunately, I won't be back even though I very much wanted to become a regular since it's right on my way to work. ... Why was my review removed?",

    "text": "Members of The Yelp Book Club discussed the book \"Argo\" by Antonio Mendez and Matt Baglio, which was made into a motion picture that recently played at theaters nationwide, starring Ben Affleck in the role of CIA agent Mendez, who led a group of Americans out of a hostile country and to safety.  The book is about what until now was a little known tale of 6 U.S. Embassy workers in Iran who, with the help of the Canadian ambassador to Iran and some stagecraft by the CIA, escaped being taken as hostages like their fellow workers after the overthrow and flight from Iran of the Shah.  In pleasant surroundings those in attendance noted how the Iran hostage crisis came to be, and observed how ironic it was that over 30 years later, Iran is back as arguably the U.S.'s chief adversary.  It was clear to all assembled that the 6 Americans would all have been taken into captivity as additional hostages had they not been hidden from sight for over 2 months and later spirited out of Iran on an airplane following implementation of a bizarre film production cover story that worked, with the assistance of some very professionally prepared False papers.  It was difficult to not make some comparisons between the book and the movie, including how the film gratuitously added some Hollywood-type hyped up action scenes that did not really occur, like dramatic security delays inside the airport, and a last-minute chase of a commercial jetliner by crazed armed revolutionaries in motorized vehicles on an airport runway desperately trying to block the plane holding the escaping Americans from taking off.  We also found it to be ironic that the freed Americans were told that they could never write a book about what they experienced, only for former spymaster Mendez to write one himself several years later.    But times change, and there was no longer a valid reason for this interesting and heartening tale of multi-state collaboration and cooperation, misdirection, courage, and fulfilled hope to remain untold!",

The whole crew always makes you feel comfortable and I've never had a drink I was unsatisfied with here. I just tried the Wannabe and just the aroma of it was mouthwatering. I recently learned that everything on the menu is handcrafted, which is a giant thumbs up for them.  At first I wasn't a fan of having to purchase a certain dollar amount in return for a couple hours of free wifi, but it was actually a clever idea for them to do.",

    "text": "I tried the Nutella white mocha iced with almond milk and the Green Card sandwich.  The REAL Nutella adds a fantastic thickness to the iced drink, the white mocha rounds out the choco-fab flavor.  The smaller size was still HUGE.  The sandwich was thin sliced turkey with lettuce, tomato, and fresh avocado smashed into the beautifully fresh focaccia (don't worry they have other delicious sounding options).  Good portion, very fresh, definitely not pre-made and sitting there.     Now I'm sure the 24 hr/driveway thing is tough to staff, but it was a little quiet on the greeting side of things when I came in. I get it. Hipster coffee shop, no need for the fake smile and small talk. Just pop your head up when you hear the door maybe.   Also the pricing is kind of vague. I was starving (my bad, I know) so I didn't question it until later when I was charged $15 for my drink and sandwich. In my travels, I have yet to spend quite that much on lil ol me at a cafe. I think perhaps the barista was sleep deprived and rang me for something extra. Eh. Yolo.   Lots of seating, nooks and crannies galore. I could get some studying done there.",

My boyfriend and I were expecting a bit more out of the experience and service but all in all the green card on a baguette is really delish! They also have a drive thru which makes everything so much easier when wanting to order on the go! The only sad thing to say would be that they do not have enough room to suite all the guests that could come here! It's more of a young urban feel. If a family of 4-5 came in, they would have difficulty seating them. BUT!! Besides the seating food is good. Most def will stop by for another sandwich or something else to try! Thank you Corey for the suggestion!! Super good. ^_^!!",

Updated review: Make sure you know that they put garlic aioli on the ungrateful dead and they will ruin your sandwich after a long night of work. Thanks to the girl on the phone who kept telling me \"yeah so I don't know what you want me to do it's not my fault it's not on the menu and that the first time you ordered a sandwich here they forgot to put in on\" then hangs up on me. We even tipped $3 for the incompetent workers that don't know how to make a sandwich. Stay away from this place unless you want to be around immature kids. If I could leave no stars I would. Awful service and horrible food on 5/21/19.",

The food is spectacular, the coffee is amazing. The wait is skittle long sometimes but it's worth it.   Unfortunately my favorite baristas are no longer working there :( Andy and Janet were by far the BEST employees: they made this place feel like a home, and I always get so warm. Nothing ever felt transactional with them. They knew my name, my order with all the specialities to it with the first time meeting them. They had my drink ready as soon as they saw me walk through the door.  I literally would spend hundreds of dollars here, get 5 or 6 coffees in one night, not even REALIZING what I've spent, because they made this place such a welcoming environment. They ALWAYS put the customer first.  The rest of the baristas are nice, but they don't make this place feel the way Andy and Janet did.  I will continue to come here on a daily basis. It's the only coffee shop open with the hours I work. I will forever love this place. I just hope I can make that connection with the baristas again, because I think it's a HUGE contribution to the overall atmosphere of the place.",

For awhile now they've had black lights in the bathroom, for \"aesthetic\" purposes, I'm assuming. The bathroom is not the place. Bathrooms are about function. When entering, its impossible to tell if the bathroom is clean or not. Earlier today I went in to use the bathroom and I'm so glad I used my phone to check the toilet, because the seat was COVERED in urine. I looked on the floor and there was also urine everywhere. I've seen dive bar bathrooms in better shape than this. I don't know what happened to this place. I really enjoy coming here and spending my money, however I don't know if I can deal with the uncleanliness. Management seriously needs to crackdown on employees and the maintenance around here. I'm here for hours at a time, and can honestly say it is seldom that I see an employee check the bathroom to ensure it's clean. This cafe is always busy and cleaning the bathroom throughout the day should be standard. Especially for an establishment that serves food. This is disgusting and unacceptable. Overall things seem to be rather untidy. Overflowing trash cans, tables left dirty with dishes that sit for several hours. I've worked in food service and in retail for years. I know things get busy and sometimes there just aren't enough hands to get everything done, but most customers are here studying, not actively ordering food/drinks and there's always plenty of staff. Having someone in charge of running through and cleaning isn't that tall of an order.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this location since it was ITS A GRIND! Lol that makes me feel old. It has definitely changed for the better and seems to continue being a great hangout/study spot and my favorite 24 hour drive through coffee spot... come to think of it, I don't know of any other 24 hour drive through coffee shops! They definitely have an edge there. Their food is seriously good for such a small coffee shop and I'd highly recommend getting one of their sandwiches. I can't remember the name of the one I got last time but it had chicken, pesto and arugula and it was DIVINE!!! Service is super. Everyone is a gem and you can tell they love their jobs.  The reason I only give 4 stars is because the past few times I have gotten iced lattes they just... didn't taste good. It had sort of a watered down day old pot of coffee taste. I've even tried different milks/flavoring to see if that was the problem but it didn't make any difference. I'll keep tryin'. P.S. thanks for changing the provocative logo on your cups! It was very sexy but not appropriate for the schools I was substitute teaching at! Yikes",

    "text": "So decided wanted try different coffee shop this week. MadHouse Coffee is one that been on the radar. I know not much left to review. My first impression was like different vibe in no way feel like your traditional coffee shop. Not only do they have traditional pastries in really display case, also have glass jars of pastries, and then comes to food. They really have nice variety of sandwiches from hot or cold. The 24/7. I know of one Starbucks that open 24/7 so having more then one option plus with more food options. MadHouse Mahalos! The decor hard described modern with twist...maybe. The two monkeys in suit straight out of pulp fiction cool decoration. Original artwork that believe you can buy if you want. The counter area next to barista making all the java art. Different spot chill at not only do you get see all the magic happen but relaxing spot read good book. Me coffee and good book go hand in hand.   The menu like that chalkboard. I know they have few signature drinks. I figure start with the matcha green tea. It was awesome. One thing that feel stood out compare other coffee spots same one. The color was vibrant green, smooth, and flavor amazing. The red velvet that one need try next cause never heard of that one before. So like the creative MadHouse offers for java lovers!!   The staff is five stars awesome. The gentlemen took my order explaining the menu being my first time. Notice wearing my Colorado Avalanche Forsberg jersey. Next thing know talking hockey stories. It was cool. I think of great coffee shop not only about great java, great spot random conversations, read great book mention earlier, and MadHouse definitely has all of those things. They also have drive-thru.   No doubt will be back and just make rotation of coffee shops on my days off now.",

As soon as you walk in you are hit with a quick wave of heat, it's super warm and cozy inside. So warm that there's kids smoking outside with their tshirts. It's 35 degrees outside. This coffee joint feels like a Brooklyn hipster cafe. I can dig it, inside pretty much resembles everything you see in Brooklyn and much more.   I jumped in around 11pm and was served instantly. Ordered three desserts and a cappuccino. The desserts beyond awesome just like the speed of the entire staff. The tiramisu x2 and the macaroon. Mind blowing how good the tiramisu was, I knew I had to order two right away just by looking at it I knew. Did not regret ordering two before I even tried them. Especially the pudding inside, probably my favorite part of the whole experience.   The cappuccino, now that's very basic. Beans, poor and the milk was cold. Only looked pretty for a photo.   I still recommend it, I like this place. I know I'm coming. Can say I'm definitely returning to try more on their menu. PS I also tried the blend strawberry smoothie. It's cold but damn that thing was bomb.",

Then, he proceeded to throw another bag of bread to another one of his employees sitting outside, who was off the clock. I don't care how badly an employee has messed up, an owner or manager should NEVER treat their employees the way he just treated her. It makes me wonder if he can treat them like that in front of customers, how does he treat them behind closed doors? The only good thing about this place was the coconut cold brew that those nice employees made for us. I will NEVER return to this place in my life, and I hope no one does. A person that treats people that way does not deserve any business from anyone. I hope all of his employees find somewhere else to work.",

I mean it depends how much you like coffee but I'm more of a tea drinker so I'm more hesitant to spend when I come here. I always come in the early morning so it's either incredibly full and busy or it's empty. The service is pretty spot on but that's because I see the same barista for the early morning shift :-)  He's very nice and super quick so I never wait too long for my drink.  Now for the drinks, they're pretty good. I recall ordering a red velvet latte once and then I stuck to a mint mocha afterwards. Both are delicious drinks and I do also recommend trying out the other desserts. They have vegan desserts and the drinks can be substituted with soy or almond milk!  There's plenty of seating inside and outside and the decor is majestic, very.  You really can't go wrong with doing homework here either. Overall I'd still come here to hang out with friends, do homework, or eat my tiramisu by myself.",

Very hip Urban vibe with a fair amount of indoor seating and plenty of outdoor setting.  Love the decor!  The art on the walls that were made by local artists, kinda Urban hipster...very cool.  I've noticed plenty of locals come here to chill.  Being 24/7 makes it more inviting, and par for a city that never sleeps.  Madhouse has a great selection of goodies such as hot/cold coffee drinks(including the water drip cold brew), sandwiches, and various desserts(made in house), even macaroons. They also have Hookah to Relax you while you get Jolted from your coffee...hmm              One Vegas scorching summer day (is there any other?), when I first laid eyes on you, I mean Madhouse.  You know, Vegas=my ### is on fire=something COLD to drink.  I chose the NUTTELA WHITE CHOCOLATE MOCHA.  Later finding out it was a local favorite.  I can taste why...outstanding drink...an absolute must try!   I also had the LOONEY TUNA, which I wasn't too crazy mad about.  It was good, just not great.  Didn't taste the red apples, almonds, and for sure couldn't tell what 'few secret ingredients' they're talking about on the menu item description.  I like my tuna very looney, creamy with a lot of flavor and texture. The CROISSANT BREAD PUDDING was a tiny bit dry, but good.  I like my puddings tender and moist to the touch, yet firm enough to keep its shape.  Now I know why I'm mad about you.              What a great coffee house!

    "text": "Came here after eating at Sen to pick up some pastries for my folks who were watching The Kid at my brother's house while The Wife and I were on a date.  The place looks like a college coffee shop set way the hell of off campus (UNLV was a good 10 miles away).  The crowd was grungy, they all had their computers, and pompously sipped away while writing their blog praises of the OWS movement.  Ok, I'm stereotyping.  But hell, it's my review.  To the pastries...the tiramisu was good - I liked how light the dessert was and how it didn't try to overpower anything with an excess of amaretto or espresso dust.  The ricotta version of the same dish was meh - I didn't like how the cheese taste came back into the dish so easily.  The apricot pastry and cherry turnovers were good - they even heated them up in a spot oven like the Subway folks.  The aroma filled up the car and tempted us to tear into them in the car.  We didn't though - we wanted to give the 'rents first crack at the goodies.  Didn't try the coffee as it was already 9:30pm and I wanted to make sure The Wife could sleep so I could sneak out and go gambling with my bro - but maybe next time if I'm back in the area.  Prices were tad high but hell, when you're on vacation, you try to pretend not to notice.",

    "text": "With expresso running through my veins...I guess it would be an understatement to say that I am always in search of a good coffee shop to make my next destination.    A friend has been telling me to try this awesome place out...of the 5 mins i was in this place..I was terribly disappointed at the customer service they provided.     I ordered 3 shots of expresso with 3 pumps of toffee nut over ice.  Seeing the price of the triple shot (2.50 + flavor shots)...I questioned the girl helping me when she quoted Over 3.50...She told me that if i order this over ice...it costs more than if i ordered it hot. (#1 reason I didn't think it was right).  So i told her to just give me a cup of ice on the side.  She charged me $2.81.  i was fine with that... I got my drink and poured about 2 tablespoons of half/half in my espresso.    Then the owner came up to my table, and said that if i poured milk in my drink next time and poured it over ice, he'll have to charge me more.  (#2 reason i didn't appreciate this place) I was a bit confused so i asked for clarification about my drink and to my disbelief, he said the next time i came in his shop and ordered my three expresso shots with flavor shots, I'd need to pay for if I add a splash of milk to my drink since he has something on the menu like that.   First of all, The amount of half/half i added was nothing amounting to the 80-90% of milk which goes into a latte (its was literally only a splash), I order the drink I wanted like any good customer would and used a bit of the condements (which i thought was free to customers who purchased something from the menu) on the side...and to have the owner come over and haggling me about it was unacceptable to me. Although there might have been a small difference in price (0.50), I didn't order the latte because it wasn't what i wanted.  He rudely made it a point to tell me that he'll be charging me for a drink i won't be ordering.      I was upset so i returned the drink to the girl who helped me and told her that although the expresso was good, I wasn't coming back.    Totally no sense of customer service...for a $0.50 difference...He lost must more since I won't be bringing them any business.   I recommend Saxbys in Henderson.  I live only 2 miles from this coffee shop and I drove over 30 minutes to visit madhouse coffee.  NEVER AGAIN.  ******   Update 8/18/2011*****************************8  I honestly don't think the owner was trying to be a pest....in retrospect, he was trying to ensure that his place stays in business.  But a tip for a consumer would be, there are better ways to approach the situation.  It really isn't good business to charge someone more for ordering expresso over ice vs. Expresso hot.    Secondly,  I order what i order with coffee because I like the taste of it.  if there was a stipulation as to how i should order my drinks because management doesn't like it simply because he isn't able to weed a penny more from me, I just don't come back.    This only employs other coffee shops that don't do that.  I pay less, but in return, I give quite a bit of tip. :)",

My family & our dogs have come here for the four and one half years since it was \"It's a Grind,\" when my Mom went through the drive thru to order catering for her party, the next day. The barista had her drinks made that day, not Halloween, as she asked. On Halloween Day, mom had gone through the drive thru just an hour before the party, buying more drinks for early party goers with out any mention by Madhouse employees that she wouldn't get her party order. My husband & I called just before we went to pick up the drinks...we were told that my Mother could get credit for half of what she paid?? She paid full retail for each of the $6.75 chai lattes, now Madhouse wants more money? That was inexcusable! As my husband and I walked away from the counter, a barista taunted us with either \"we leave, or he'd have to call the police.\" Mom ordered & paid, their barista got the date wrong, we got nothing & were insulted...dudes, you have forever lost good customers who tip.

I took a look behind the counter and all the stuff they use to blend drinks , steam milk, cut meat/food, was literally all piled in a tiny sink. They literally didn't even fully wash out a blender before starting another drink!! The owner is also a reason I would not go back. He gave me just a not good feeling and I have heard my friends say he is rude and arrogant . Wifi is NOT free so you have to spend a certain amount just to get an hour of wifi, and whn that hour ends you have to purchase something els from there dirty coffee shop. I've tried about three pastries. The tiramisu (sour), crossant (incredibly dry) and a macaroon (only decent thing ) . I even know someone personally who went here and got instant diarrhea . Will not be coming back although the people and hookas and young crowd make it look like the place to be. All I can say is they have nice employees . That is all.",

Coffee house sadly needs a good cleaning as  floors and tables were dirty last few times we visited .My salads are always good not great and portions have seemed to get smaller while prices are still a bit high compared to other coffee houses. Service slow and hardly no customers . Plus every time we go in they are always out of an ingredient on the menu. The staff seems more concerned with giving free stuff to their friends than actually waiting on real customers. My drink was made incorrectly and extremely rude female employee argued with me and said she would have to charge me for a new one .Employee went on to say that the drink was fine and  continued to argue her point.My huband's iced coffee tasted like coffee was brewed day prior but after awful attitude from employee over my drink we gave up and left. Well they lost my business and my  family's as well I have many choices and Mad House will not be one of them.

    "text": "I've been looking for a 24 hour coffee shop ever since I moved to Las Vegas.  Going to the strip for coffee is just to far out of my way. My sister wanted some coffee and I wanted something hot, so I decided to try the mudhouse hot chocolate which was recommended to me by one of there very nice baristas. They brought it to my table which was nice, I didn't have to stand around waiting to pick up my order, or hear my name; and they brought it to me in a ceramic mug, which gave it an extra nice touch! It was heaven in a cup, very delicious! I also got a chocolate croissant. They warmed it up in the oven and it was very tasty and complimented my mudhouse hot chocolate fabulously! My sister tried there new peppermint bark , which is made with white chocolate and peppermint. She isn't a peppermint fan, but loves white mocha, so she gave it a try. She loved it, it was rather sweet but says she would order it again. They also brought that over in a ceramic mug with whip cream and candy cane sprinkles! She had the Chicken Parmesan sandwich, I had a bite it was so warm and tasty. The bread was very soft!  We are defenitely  making this our spot. The owner came over and introduced himself, and all the staff was really nice, they seem to enjoy what they do and were great with welcoming us and making suggestions, cause in a new place I don't always know what I want. I thought the ambiance was very chic, it was a True coffee shop, not some chain that all look a like and the staff has to be nice to you! which all feels so fake anyway. This place was real and down to earth. I heard they are pet friendly, so I will be bringing both my dogs over. It's cool cause the dog park is right across the street. I can get a hot coffee before heading over to the park!",

Comfortable seating, but can get crowded pretty quickly inside. Usually always enough patio space though. Lots of students seem to frequent it and I see familiar faces most every weekend.  The coffee & tea isn't all that fantastic however (though where is it that good in this city?).  Standard shake tea bags (loose leaf should be a standard by now) and coffee that's been sitting too long in their carafes.  However, their friendly atmosphere and eclectic music make up for this shortcoming in my opinion.",

The little ones had a hot chocolate and it wasn't too chocolatey. So..my verdict..it's 24 hours.  How can you beat that?",

    "text": "I've been going here for many, many moons.This place was great for awhile, then it got a little shady (I watched a barista do some pretty gnarly stuff foodhandling-wise, not malicious but obviously the result of poor or no training), and now I'm a pretty big fan again. I gave it another try after staying away for awhile and I'm pleased I came back.  The drinks are good - yeah, they're not cheap, but the quality justifies the prices IMO. Food is good but a bit pricey for what you get. An $8 sandwich should come with some chips or fruit or something and the prep is often inconsistent. The presentation (wooden boards) is cool. If I get hungry while I'm there I'm generally satisfied but if I can wait til I leave I will.  Pros: Vegan options (they even have a raw vegan brownie and truffle at times), alternative milks (coconut, hemp, cashew, almond, soy), freshly made gourmet chocolates (apparently the owner is learning the craft, which is pretty awesome IMO), good quality coffee (the coffee actually tastes yummy, not burnt like SOME places...), nice mix of people, friendly vibe, nice employees, local and not chain/huge coffee conglomerate  Cons: Seating is ragingly uncomfortable and the internet is only accessible via 4-hour codes you get by request after you've purchased something (this policy seems to change all the time though - sometimes there are codes, sometimes there aren't). Clearly the owner doesn't like squatters, which is and understandable concern but still funny since there are always people hanging out for hours anyways, they're just smoking hookah instead of staring at their laptops. Oh, and the music is borderline awful at times. Setting a vibe is one thing; earsplitting EDM is not. If I wanted to be at a club, I'd go to one. Used to have actually coffee cups and plates, now most stuff comes out in paper to-go cups and food containers. It's also really crowded sometimes but that's good for Madhouse, just not so great when you get there late and there's nary a stool to be had  Overall, I recommend it, even if I want to say I don't so people like you will stay out of my seat. :D",

Late Thursday afternoon and pretty tired out from schoolwork, I came here for a More Cowbell sandwich treat - roast beef folded into a slice of herb infused focaccia bread and topped with cheddar, lettuce and tomatoes - and a Nutella white chocolate frappe.   As if they weren't filling enough, I made an effort to take myself out of study mode to appreciate the cool artworks around the cafe and random funny deets on the cashier. That fed my artsy soul pretty well and I came out of there physically and spiritually refreshed. For $10 or more spent, you get a wifi code. There's a patio out for peeps in need of a smoke and did I say this cafe is open 24 hours?   Coming here to study again soon and get things done!",

I thought they were associated with the one in Henderson but I learned they were their own entity. Either way they are open 24 hours, the staff is awesome and they serve intelligentsia brew which is one of the Better brews available in the las Vegas coffee shop market.  I love the coziness of the place, the quick and quality brews as well as the drive through. And don't be shocked by the lower prices for stuff that other coffee shops overcharge for. You can get homemade desserts like tiramisu here for as little as 5 bucks. Plus they have nutella tiramisu for all you nutella lovers- as well as a nutella latte or red velvet latte.   They have a cute outdoor patio too so when the weather is nice you can always hang out there and enjoy your coffee. I thought it was a nice touch. Not all places have  that.  So I've been here a few time now and I'm enjoying it so I will continue to go back until it becomes trendy......",

Upon walking in i liked how cozy the place felt and spotted a nice comfortable chair to sit in after ordering.  I am a sucker for a Caramel Macchiato, so when i saw it on their menu i immediately knew what i wanted.  The lady who took my order was incredibly nice and easy going. Also you can choose to have your coffee in a ceramic cup too! pretty snazzy!  I find it kind of interesting they sell smokes and hookah tobacco here. I saw they were selling a hookah setup in the front along with packs of cigarettes and other smokes behind the counter.  The man who handed me my caramel macchiato saw my vape and said i was able to vape inside. I said \"really?\" in a surprised look and he said as long as there's no drugs, there is no problem. Now, i wouldn't be filling the whole cafe with vapor but i love to vape with a good cup of coffee and since there's no problem vaping here i believe this is my favorite cafe.  Short but sweet. Definitely give their coffee a good go if you're in the area. Friendly customer service and great tasting coffee in a home-y and comfortable shop. Will definitely be back",

The ladies behind the counter were helpful, even though the one who took my order seem to be new. However, she rang up my order quickly and was very friendly. Unlike Starbucks, if you order regular coffee, they have a few selections off to the side you can pour yourself. That's when I saw that you can even purchase cigarettes from them. I'm not a smoker myself, but just thought that was definitely unique. I guess for the late-night coffee drinkers...  After getting my coffee and sesame bagel, I thought I'd definitely come back here. It's a nice change up from the chains coffee/bagel shops we see so often.",

Went through the drive thru and ordered a blended mocha monkey, hot matcha latte and a \"Usual Suspect\" sandwich on baguette to split.  The mocha monkey had real peanut butter blended into the drink which you can definitely taste and the matcha tea latte (which is my go to drink) was nice and smooth and not too sweet.  I usually like ordering the matcha either after dinner when I am looking for something not too heavy and/or sweet or in this case something light to go with my breakfast sandwich, the matcha delivers every time!  This was the first time we ordered a sandwich and decided to split it just to hold us over until lunch.    The usual suspect included scrambled eggs, cream cheese,cheddar cheese and bacon.  We decided to order the sandwich on baguette, the baguette was soft and crusty on the outside and the combination of the fillings made this a perfect breakfast sandwich.  Definitely want to come back and try more of the sandwiches there.  *The Large blended drinks are really big, we were surprised of how big it was, probably could've split this between 2 people.",

So, here I am at It's A Grind, which is a chain. Sunrise Coffee is just too far for a lazy afternoon.   This location has a charming Las Vegas patio, and every time we drive by, there are at least 20 caffeine fiends living it up in the sunshine. I always say, \"What is going on there?\" Today, we found out. I think part of the secret is that this is a fiend's paradise; they sell both coffee and cigarettes, including American Spirit for all of you health conscious smokers. They also sell cigars, flavored cigars, and hookahs! If you have a legal mind-altering addiction, um, I think they have it, but just to clarify, despite the name, they do not offer lap dances.   The vices they do offer are pretty much all wasted on me because I generally don't do coffee, and I don't smoke. Still, there is something for everyone, and my something happened to be a 50/50 today. If you covet creamsicles, this is the spot. A 50/50 is fresh squeezed OJ blended with Ghiradelli White Chocolate, and it is genius blended with goodness. Yum. They also have some sandwiches, breakfast bagels and Nutella.  The crowd is cool. The service is friendly. I wish it were a little bigger, and I wish they had couches. Also, the WiFi is not limitless. You have 4-hours to get in and get done. Still, the patio is nice; they are open 24-hours, and the 50/50 might be habit-forming.",

I asked if I could have a shot of Espresso and told them my latte didn't taste anything but milk and they told me the espresso machine wasn't on. They turned it on and gave me a shot of espresso and charged me for it, not to mentioned I tipped the associate for my latte. Worst customer service!!!!!! Especially that we had to wait 10 min before to order because the 2 associates were chatting in the back. Will not go back there......",

Their food is made to order and right in front of you so you know it's fresh. I felt comfortable enough with here to bring my ferret with me, and as soon as I did the crew was happy to see him and greet him when we come in.  They have a great little outside patio for smokers or people who want to sit outside. At this point it is sort of my second home. The prices are also really good, coffee or tea and a healthy sandwich is under $10.",

The large iced coffee was humongous, and coming from Chicago, the intelligentsia coffee with soy milk tasted familiar and was a great surprise I enjoyed all the way to flagstaff! I also ordered the turkey, ham, pepperoni, provolone, and lettuce sandwich (can't remember the name, something like the \"Vito\") and I was asked what kind of bread I wanted. Nice...

There is a distinct difference in the food and drink quality here. You can tell the pastries are actually  homemade unlike the packaged thawed out baked goods at most chain shops. The Almond Crossaint is to die for. I am addicted to the Red Velvet blended mocha as it is not too sweet or overwhelming as I expected it might be. It definitely hits the spot. Only disappointment I have was with the sandwiches. I expected the bread to be alot fresher or at least toasted with some sort of olive oil coating or something. I opted for the Ron Jeremy the first time and an egg and cheese the second. I noticed my bread was cold and hard and did not seem to be the freshest both times. I think I might give it another try with maybe a different bread or ask for my bread warmed up. The Coconut blended Mocha is also yummy but a bit too sweet for my taste. The Peanut Butter blended mocha was interesting but again, maybe a bit too much for my taste buds. Try a Macaroon. They have a new flavor daily and are really good.",

The coffee, if I can even call it that, is way too sweet. I was taken back from my first sip and I couldn't take any more sips after the fourth one because there was just too much sugar. The macaroons were okay, again, too sweet. The service were average, but you'll always see the what seems to be French guy there at night and he is rather friendly. They gave me the wrong drink once and insisted that I ordered it wrong rather than admitting that they got the order wrong, which really bothered me. I took the drink anyways as I didn't want to cause any trouble but that is not the customer service I, or anyone, would want upon. The best thing about Madhouse is the fact that they are 24 hours, living up to the Vegas name because not a lot of place nearby is 24 hours.

    "text": "I would give this place no stars at all if it were possible. As a college student, I spend a lot of time (and money) in coffee shops, and I can honestly say that I will never be going back to this particular coffee shop ever again. I will also be informing everyone that I know about how TERRIBLE their service is, and how extremely RUDE their store owner is. My first experience with MadHouse Coffee was alright. I ordered a spiced chai tea latte (that happened to be nothing special) and stayed for about 15 minutes to study. Their decor is odd, for lack of a better word. You also have to be careful about using their bathroom since the door does not lock properly. My second experience occurred the very next day, and it was by far the WORST customer experience I've ever had in my entire 22 years of life! My best friend and I were in need of a place to study near my school and her home. Seeing as I had another class that night, and wanting a change of scenery, I suggested MadHouse Coffee...BIG MISTAKE, we should have just gone to a Starbucks instead. We were planning on studying for 3 hours there, but promptly left after their store owner was extremely rude to us. We had grabbed a couple of subs before going to this coffee shop and had brought them in with the intention of eating them and ordering coffee and possibly a pastry after wards. This is usually our routine when we go to Starbucks as well. So, when we get there, they have the door propped open, and the owner is sitting outside with whom I assume is a friend, smoking a cigar, resulting in the inside seating area smelling strongly of smoke. So we politely asked if we could close the door, and the guy behind the counter said that \"it's your choice.\" So, instead of subjecting ourselves to second hand smoke, and 45 degree temperature, we close the door. Not long after we settle in, the store manager comes inside and informs us that they do not allow outside food in their shop. So, I respond that we will be buying drinks from them, and store that info in my memory bank for next time. I understand that some places are hurting for business, and therefore make such rules, and I completely understand. It's not like our economy is doing great lately. So, I finish my sub, thinking that's the end of that, but he comes back inside to re-inform my best friend of their no outside food policy (she was still finishing her food up). So she responds with, \"Do you want me to throw it away?\" And he rudely replies that it's her choice, and pretty much states that if we aren't going to purchase anything then we must leave. This being after we have already informed him that we will be making a purchase and are here to study. So, after he spends time staring her down and flat out humiliating her in front of other customers, she shoves the rest of her food in her backpack, and he walks away, but that's not the end of it. He walks away to gossip with his employees, point at us angrily, and this of course results in some very rude stares. We didn't stay much longer after that, but in the short time period that we were there, there were at least 4 people who do not work there, hanging out behind the counter with there friends, and I noticed hookah, cigarette, and cigar products. Mind you, many of his employees look much to young to be selling any such products. So, if you have small children, STAY AWAY. I am a part-time nanny and regular babysitter. The environment is terrible for kids. Unless you're a parent who is willing to explain the concept of smoking and hookah at a young age, and alright with subjecting them to an extremely rude owner's second hand cigar smoke.  In the end, we ended up at the Starbucks on Fort Apache and Sahara. The employees and manager there are extremely kind. This entire experience has taught me that I should just stick with Starbucks.  Seeing as the owner responded, I'd just like to point out that his reply is obviously RUDE and proves my point. Apparently, he does not want people who buy from Starbucks, McDonalds (which I do not, by the way), and Walmart to stop at his location. I wish he'd advertise that on his door, because I'm sure that he'd lose 80% of his business. We DID NOT bring outside drinks, just a sub, and we had specifically told him that we were planning on buying not only drinks, but most likely would be purchasing pastries as well. I would also like to point out the fact that he states that MadHouse is always busy. Both times that I have been there, there have been no more than 4 people at this location, excluding the people hanging out behind the counter. Now, I am not saying that it is never busy. I'm sure it gets busy especially since it is one of the few 24 hour coffee shops in Vegas, and any 24 hour study location is sure to get busy once the other shops are closed. Just saying.",

    "text": "It's a Grind is a nice little coffee house off Desert Inn. It's located in a strip mall which takes away some of the appeal. But in Vegas, what isnt located in a strip mall??? LOL  Anyway, they have great free internet if you purchase from them, a wide variety of coffee and blended drinks, and a good selection of tasty pastries. Except for the extra high prices, I enjoy going there. The music is usually not the typical canned variety, the decor is urban chic, and chairs are comfy, and the staff is always nice and knowledgeable about their products.  Good outdoor seating as well.  Basically everything you hate about Starbucks has been fixed here, except the prices LOL.  Oh and to all the Starbucks employees out there: You guys are a bunch of pretentious fucking assholes who wouldnt know good coffee or service if it spilled in your lap. I pray for the day Star-chucks goes under.  Oh yeah, and unlike so many other things here, they are open 24/7!!!!",

    "text": "MadHouse coffee is a solid, un-cookie cutter coffee place in Vegas. I really appreciate places that aren't a Starbucks or a Coffee Bean or a Seattles Best. I try to avoid chains as much as possible unless it's a gas station.  MadHouse is located next to one of my favorite nail shops in town. Usually before a pedi on Sundays, I'll stop in at MadHouse which is never too busy. Service is always friendly and they offer some unique flavors: Nutella, Red Velvet, and a few other that are escaping me at the moment.Trust me, these drinks are sweet. I feel like I may get diabetuuus every time I indulge.  MadHouse offers homemade sandwiches and baked item. All of which have been decent, nothing that has me running back or craving. MadHouse has a drive-thru (which doesn't encompass their huge menu - go inside people, especially if you're ording the diabetuuuus lattes and whatnot), offers free Wifi, and has open mic nights, which are odd because the place isn't really built to hold more than I'd say 10-15 comfortably and the tables are like huge slabs of cement.   My ordered a big iced here once and when I noticed she wasn't drinking it, she said it was sour, and it was. I told her to stop by on the way back to her house, I ran in, they replaced it and apologized and offered me a free cookie (which I declined because it's FESTIVAL SEASON, baby).  MadHouse is good, not great, and certainly not the best coffee house in Vegas, but a nice change of pace from the landscape of so many Starbucks.",

    "text": "I love coffee shops but I can think of a few off the top of my head that I'd rather frequent.  And no I'm not including any major chains like Starbucks or Coffee Bean.  I have been here twice.    COFFEE: I'm not a fan of their drinks.  The first time I tried some mint mocha latte.  Meh.  It was mediocre.  The second time I tried the white chocolate hazelnut... gah.  Just terrible.  This leads me to my other point...they're not cheap.  Since I spent like 6 dollars on this latte I decided to finish it but it was SO SWEET that I felt like I was going to gag for the next three hours after it.  I've never experienced that with coffee. My boyfriend seemed to like his drinks both times.  He seems okay with coffee drinks being somewhat of a dessert; I, however, do not like my drinks to taste like a dessert.  AMBIANCE: I like to study in coffee shops so ambiance is important to me.  Too small inside and nothing special.  Their music is better than most though.    WIFI, GRR: The way they do their wifi is just annoying to me.  As someone else said, they're greedy.  Why come here when other coffee shops with better coffee have unlimited wifi with purchase?  I guess their only appeal is being open 24 hours.  Last time I went I was studying from my textbook but my boyfriend wanted to use their wifi.  He spent 12 dollars because he got a pastry and latte; when he asked the lady for a wifi slip she gave him the \"4$-7$ One hour\" slip, even though he paid more and should have received more wifi time.  Even typing that makes me so peeved because this shouldn't even be an issue.  Not only did she short him but I also spent 6 dollars on my subpar drink so we really should have gotten additional time.  Like I said though... why is this even a thing?!  The place isn't even big enough to have a ton of people slowing down the wifi.  SILVER LINING/TL;DR: They have a wide array of sandwich choices which is a nice option to have.  They also have a drive through, which is convenient.  It's not terrible but two stars means, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that is a perfect way to describe my sentiment about this place.",

My second time here  Came here yesterday for a break away from my daughter with the great company of my grandmother. it was super packed, which I had never seen before. especially at 1pm. Great sign that business is booming!  Walking in, I knew I wanted something cool and refreshing since it was over 80 degrees out. So i ordered a 16 oz carmel mocha frap. On the other hand my gram is old fashion and was craving coffee so she got a plain old black coffee. I like that when you order plain coffee, you receive as much as you like. Which is a great deal you cant sway from.   Since it was lunch time we wanted something small and filling. Looking at the top, far menu behind the counter we couldnt read well. Yes, I have bad eyes :P The young lady at the counter was sweet and helpful and handed us larger, clearer menus that said the sandwiches and what was in them. We finally decided upon the Turkey, bacon, guac. I was watching my carb intake, so I couldnt decide between their two options listed. The girl was kind enough to offer a third, hidden choice.. it was their healthy spinach wrap. that was what we went with. I being the fatty asked for a side of mayo.   Sitting, the coffee was ready within five minutes or so. The sandwich took another five or so and they made it fresh in front of us. It was the most delicious wrap I had ever had no joke. The bacon was extremely crunchy. The guac wasnt overwhelming and there was a huge amount of turkey. I was impressed. They had cut it in half and it was a generous size sandwich wrap.   Love that this place is 24 hours, dogs are allowed out on the patio (they have doggie water bowls outside), free wifi (with code), has a drive through, tasty coffee and reasonably priced breakfast and lunch sandwiches. sounds like a winner to me. This is def going to be my favorite spot from now on!!",

Madhouse has always been my local cafe for hanging out late with friends or having a lunch date during the day when you want to catch up with an old friend. I usually love the environment, and the drink/food options is delectable.  BUT I was given the worst service I've ever received by and girl named Haley tonight in the drive thru.  H: \"Hi, my name is Haley, Welcome to Madhouse\"  Me: Hi Haley, I need just a moment to order.  H: \"Ok.\"  Me: Ok, I'm ready to order.  Me: Okay, she wants a Italian Hot Chocolate.  H: \"Okay\"  Me: Can you make that with soy?  H: (raising her voice) \"I thought that's what you originally ordered?\"  Me: Yes but I didn't say with soy, so can you make it with soy please?  H: (impatiently) \"So you want a White Nutella Hot Chocolate?\"  Me: No, I just want an Italian Hot Chocolate made with soy.  H: (irritated) \"Just the one drink?\"  Me: No, I'll take-  H: (Rudely) What else do you want?  Me: i said I'll take a-  H: (interrupting) \"Pull up to the window\"  Me: (Drive passed her window angry)  I was so upset that she was rude that I just left and I've never skipped out on coffee.

    "text": "Items selected:  Croissant Bread Pudding White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron Almond Croissant Nutellamisu Americano  With 9 on the Plate not yet serving up sweets and myself running low on caffeine it was to MadHouse Coffee that I walked after dinner and always hoping to find a new, local coffee shop to love and support I'll simply say that save for the kitschy decor and 24-hour service there isn't a whole lot to like about MadHouse at all.  Locally owned and operated with a menu of drinks both classic and novel plus a collection of \"pastries baked fresh on the premises\" it with a simple Americano that my experience began and faring well enough at a mere $2.50 it was onward to pastry that I moved, the promise of '100% Charent Butter' ostensibly promising the quality of Echire but not a single item better than average, with one in particular an early contender for worst thing I'll eat in 2014.  Starting first with a $3.24 Almond Croissant it would be hard to imagine something more doughy and less crisp coming from 7-Eleven and moving right along to a $2.50 White Chocolate Raspberry Macaron with decent crackle yielding gummy crumb and sweet 'frosting' of a non-descript flavor I sat and wondered exactly what was going on; a brief reprieve found in admirable, albeit microwave-heated bread pudding drizzled in light caramel.  At this point sitting with half a macaron and 2/3 of the croissant unfinished it was last, and certainly least that I moved to the 'nutellamisu\" and while certainly not the prettiest presentation nothing could have prepared me for the taste - an acrid, sour, and questionably spoiled cream cheese 'pudding' debauchery of the Italian classic that tasted nothing of Nutella or Tiramisu, a second bite of the $3.95 cup yielding similar results and landing it plus the remaining pastries in the trash as I left the store thankful I'd not yet finished my coffee so as to cleanse my palate.",

This place is also 24hours, so it's great for college students and night owls. At this coffee shop, the owner comes around often and he is super nice as well. With the music, it suits the coffee shop since it is upbeat and helps with productivity (to me). Overall, I enjoy the energy of Madhouse and it will possibly remain my favorite coffee shop in Vegas.",

It's a very cool, edgy environment to get some work done in or hang with friends, but I won't come here much because of how pricey their drinks are, and because I can only handle so much anti Trump/anti establishment decorations.",

    "text": "First off, I couldn't have been more excited to find the much-raved about (vegan) \"Impossible Burger\", since when Impossible Foods first rolled it out, it was only available at very high-end restaurants in SF, LA, NYC... Madhouse owner Marco's take on it is absolutely exquisite--the burger buns tasted lightly pan-grilled to perfection creating a slight crunch on the inner side yet smooth, soft and warm on the outer sandwiching the mouth-watering vegan patty (the flavor and texture of which is impossible to discern from the finest beef burger) superbly cooked and topped with arugula (et al) and uniquely served with delicious yucca fries. All for the unbeatable price of $13.99. It is definitely worth every morsel, but add to that, Madhouse serves Intelligentsia coffee! Who knew!? What a pairing. Anyone with a discriminating taste for coffee/espresso knows that nearly all others don't come close. It's like I was back at Venice Beach on Abbott Kinney ordering my favorite cappuccino from the (always crowded) Intelligentsia cafe. I must say that Marco and his wife Kimberly (both vegans so they know...) were incredibly hospitable, went out of their way to be engaging with customers as well as with their employees as they helped right along side them behind the counter. I loved the creative, thought-provoking liberal art and energy that is Madhouse Coffee. It brought me back to the places I used to frequent in Greenwich Village, SoHo, Venice Beach, Silverlake, Hollywood, etc. Overall, I highly recommend this place; hands down, there's no place quite like it in all of Las Vegas.",

Of their sandwiches, I really enjoy the pasquale, on focaccia with extra pesto. It comes with three different meats, and they fuse together perfectly.

The green tea latte was good but including everything else it was a complete disaster and I have no intent to return.",

It was awesome, like expected. The service was flawless.  My only concern is when I went to the restroom, I was reminded of the red velvet I had consumed earlier. I was a bit concerned. It was the only thing I had all day at the point.  Heck it's still good, but I'm wondering what's in it?",

The service was also very helpful and accomodating. The guy seemed very interested in helping us out with our order and even gave us a menu to look at as the menu you view when you drive through the \"drive thru\" is VERY tall and you CANNOT see it unless you stick your head out the window. Definately a design flaw!!!!",

The owner, Marco, is a great guy, he cares about his customers and he takes care of any concerns one might have. Andrea is my fave barista- thanks to her natural sincerity and jolliness! Every morning before work, this is where I'd be found. And on my days off, my system still asks for some madhouse! I'm so madly in love with this place. No one will understand my obsession...",

However, I have had a consistent issue with their mocha coffee; it is lukewarm, which is a criminal offense in the coffee world that should be prosecutable!

Until they gave my order to an UberEATS driver with a dead cell phone so I never received it. Normally great food, great service!  But whoever the \"manager\" is on duty this morning at 6am on 6/26 dropped the ball. Your employees have better customer service than you do and would've done more to make this right.

Their menu has everything from food, drinks & hookah :)  There are outlets throughout the store and different seatings from the bar, tables and outdoor tables. Make sure to sign up for their rewards program if you plan on visiting often or making this place the go-to study spot.  Love all the stickers they have throughout the store and their bathrooms are black lights lit.  Came in with a friend and didn't even have to order anything since they gave me their previous mistake order. It ended up being the red velvet mocha blended. She ended up ordering the same thing but iced (the iced version looked questionable since it was really red, but so much better)  If you plan on renting hookah, they pack everything and give you disposable tips. (They'll mix AS many flavors as you want, so go ahead treat yo self! I tried the lemon, mint & guava....so good )",

No, you mean you couldn't read a ticket and made a sausage breakfast sandwich and passed on the sandwich to me under the guise of doing a good deed rather than just screwed up.

    "text": "I've been going to Madhouse on the regular for a couple years, and it's the kind of place where you run into friends you haven't seen for a while or make new ones. I've had several things on the menu, and my faves are Monkey Mocha, the new Avocado toast, chia seed pudding (try it- so good!), vegan bowl (the chick peas are my fav), and I've tried most of the sandwiches and honestly I have a hard time choosing every time. Full disclosure: I'm now friends with the owner, Marco, and he develops his own recipes and seeks out special ingredients like the Calabrian pepper stuff on the avocado toast-- it has a unique flavor you won't find everywhere. He caters to his clientele (who usually want sweet drinks), but he knows his coffee, so ask some questions and you'll get what you're looking for. The quality of the coffee is very important to him, and I'm a person who usually uses sweetener in the crappy coffee I have at home, but prefer to go without when I get it at Madhouse, because it's less bitter than mine and doesn't really need it. Italian hot chocolate = amazing. I lived in Italy and used to bring back packets of it from the grocery store in my luggage. No joke. What you get at Madhouse is a higher quality version of that, and my ITALIAN friends order it on the regular. Best part: it's open late! So when everything else on the west side is closed, Madhouse is open for meeting with friends or the \"after party\". Plus it will totally impress that first date (as long as they're not your grandma. But maybe even your grandma, if she's cool. LOL).",

They make their croissants from scratch (the only way it should be done) and they are crispy, flaky, buttery, and delicious.   The breakfast croissant comes with egg and cheddar cheese and while it's delicious, the cheese and butter combined makes it pretty heavy. Would prefer an egg croissant with vegetables instead. But I guess if it's late (and maybe I'm a lil tipsy), an egg and cheddar croissant will suffice!",

They have great breakfast sandwiches, my new obsession is the  avocado toast!   Nice and friendly staff however I could not justify a 5th star because the prices are pretty high and when I was asked if I wanted chili on my avocado toast apparently it must have been an extra charge which was not clarified when I was asked if I wanted  it. $6.50 for Toast I thought was steep but when I looked at my receipt and saw $7.50 for Toast that is a bit much. In addition I believe that the first time I came in I ordered a Large ice blended matcha green tea and it was $7.00. The third visit I asked for a medium and received a medium but I believe the price was still $7.00.",

I have ordered many sandwiches, and my only complaint is that the baguette is very tough, so I recommend getting the focaccia. I have come here many times to do homework and I am able to get a lot done.   My only downside here is that the space is small compared to others, so it fills up quick. I sometimes find it hard to find a seat but it is all worth it in the end. It can also get a bit hot from time to time, so don't dress too heavy because you will sweat lol.

My only qualm is that the wifi is only accessible with a code for 2 hours and they keep printing out new codes. To me this doesn't seem cost effective nor healthy for the environment. Also if the shop is open 24 hours people will be inclined to stay longer and would need to use the internet for longer than 2 hours. Maybe they have this system in effect to reduce the amount of people in the shop? I am not sure. The bathroom is one for the books!",

    "text": "The highlight of this joint is the atmosphere, too bad the rest of our experience didn't live up to the aesthetic.  We ordered two servings of the gnocchi pesto, one with pine nuts and one without due to an allergy. The dishes arrived seemingly as ordered, we both dig in only to find pine nuts hidden in the dish. Luckily, I didn't need my epi-pen (those things are expensive). I return the dish explaining that I need it without nuts and the manager/owner/guy in charge informs me that the pesto also has walnuts.  It would have been nice to know upon my initial order that the dish had nuts regardless of the pine nut situation.  So, instead I order the prosciutto salad. I wait, drinking my coffee before the waitress brings me my meal. She plops down a caprese salad instead of prosciutto. I was pretty hungry by this point so I just shut up and ate it. You know what? It wasn't bad - just not what I ordered... for the second time.  The coffee was okay. Ordered a pour over that was a bit thin. My dining partner ordered a coffee drink that the staff forgot about and didn't arrive until midway through her meal after I received my make-up dish.   Let this be a lesson to those who would toss a few bucks into the tip jar BEFORE service. Now that I think about it, the caprese salad probably cost less than my initial order. Damn, more money down the drain.",

It's a nice place inside and they were friendly.  They said \"Sit anywhere and we'll bring you your food.\" I chose to sit outside. Bad move apparently. When the girl brought my breakfast croissant, half of it slipped off the plate onto the metal table. All she did was say \"Sorry about that.\" and walked inside. There was no offer to make another or even a \"Would you like another half made?\" Nothing.  The sandwich itself was not the best either. It was bacon, egg and cheese. The egg was still a little drippy and not cooked fully. The bacon was limp. While I personally don't like crispy bacon, I know I'm still cooking it properly. I have no idea whether all of this was undercooked or not, but my stomach became upset after eating most of it. The green matcha iced latte was tasty, but incredibly heavy on the dairy. Did they use milk or full cream? It took a few hours for my stomach to settle down.  The ambiance and location is nice but I won't be coming back.",

The coffee is still too bitter for my taste but the salad was good!   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Someone was talking about this place so I decided to stop by here on the way home today for a hot caramel macchiato. I'm sad to say I'm a little disappointed at this drink. It was dull, bitter and reminded me a lot of Starbuck's caramel macchiato. I've gotten used to the real caramel flavor that Sunrise and even Sambalatte uses and that's what I like to taste in a caramel macchiato. You know when you heat up sugar and water on the stove and it boils down into this golden color with a slightly smokey caramel flavor? That's the real caramel flavor one should taste in a caramel macchiato, in which this drink lacks.   I'm moving to this side of town in a few weeks and Sunrise will be too far for me to frequent. It's unfortunate that I don't like Madhouse's Coffee shop for the only coffee drink that I really like.",

I just ended up getting my coffee & leaving. The place is very trendy but not at all what is displayed on website when it comes to food/pastries. i understand if i came midday, it was barely 9:30a. Even their tv with images of their menu was wrong, they don't have turn around to be considered 24hr service unless all you want is a coffee. this is a saturday morning, should have stock.",

In the end, I settled for a regular iced latte and it tasted like 95% milk and 5% coffee. Not so good.  I bought a two drinks, which amounted to 1 hour of wifi (why isn't wifi free in the first place?) and the cashier insisted that I could only get the 30 minute wifi code. What even.  I only tried this place out because so many people told me it was amazing. I really don't see it. The only thing I like is that it's open 24/7 and has a nice vibe to it. However, the whole drink ordeal and the customer service put me off - the employees only really talked to the people they already knew and the cashier was the opposite of friendly. I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. Maybe if I were a smoker I would appreciate the expansive outdoor patio more, but I couldn't even take advantage of that feature.  Bumping this up to two stars because my friend got tea that tasted decent. If I ever go back, I'd probably stick to the tea.",

The service is always amazing. You'll never walk into a Starbucks and they'll ask if you want your pastry warmed or they'll never off to bring you drink out to where you're sitting when it's ready.   The art is funky, there is free Wi-Fi, and if you sit on their tiny patio there is even a bit of a Strip view.  Their mango ice tea is my favorite. There are little things that make this place different such as using crushed ice instead of cubed ice, and the fact you can get your ice drink (whatever it is) in a 32 OUNCE size! It's overload but who cares?  Also, this is an extremely dog-friendly coffee shop. Not sure if you can bring them inside, but you can definately have them on the patio. Whether at the counter or the drive-thru, the staff will provide a doggie treat. They can even provide a water bowl. Not to mention it's across the street from the biggest and probably most popular dog park in all of Vegas.  DId I mention they have a drive-thru?",

Wonderful place to come with friends and just chill, especially late afternoon and early evening before it gets too busy. It's sometimes packed at 2am! Atmosphere is really relaxing. You sometimes wait a long time for orders, and orders are not correct, but this does not happen frequently, so it's definitely worth over-looking and coming anyway!",

I'm all about coffee in a ceramic mug and while I'm usually a purist sometimes I like to mix it up and add a bit of flavored coffee in with my bold black coffee.  While I admit I also frequent chains that are walking or running distance from my home, the independent Madhouse - located on Desert Inn and Durango in  Vons shopping center - certainly wins rave reviews from me as a spot to meet up with a friend, colleague or client.  I believe this was formerly an It's  A Grind? While I didn't indulge - the pastries looked fabulous.",

The Free Wifi is awesome (take note starbucks, you cheap monsters) and the coffee is brewed nice and strong.  Fear not lovers of frappe's and sweet drinks, they do those very well too.  Looking around the shop, its clear that the owner put his heart into this place.  I love when the personality of the owners shine through in a business, and the artwork on the wall demonstrates this well.  Work by the street artists Space Invader and Bansky adorn the walls, along with some Keith Herring designs.  Not to rain on the Las Vegas establishments sense of art, but it was really refreshing to be in a place where Georgia O'Keefe prints or neon beer signs were no where to be seen.  The pastries here are very tasty.  I sat down to a pumpkin tirmasu and an espresso recently.  The espresso was wonderfully bold and satisfying.  The pumpkin tiramisu was creamy, rich, and fun.  I wished I wasn't by myself, as the slice was huge and I couldn't finish it.    There is also a drive-thru and this place is 24 hours!  I forget the owner's name, but he was very nice.  He told me a lot of the artwork had special importance to him and his wife.  Things like this make a simple cup of espresso taste refreshingly fantastic.    They say the pasta in Italy is so much better because you're in Italy.  I found the coffee to follow suit here, since the atmosphere is so warm, welcoming, and wonderful.",

Quoting a friend \"OMGGGGG why did they change it! I want It's a Grind back, MadHouse is so stupid!\". Alright... crazy girl. Aside from some minor aesthetics such as a new sign, a new paint job, some contemporary art, some new tables, a few more sandwiches, I wouldn't say much has changed. It's still the same owner (they wrote in big letters on the window), mostly the same menu, same store layout, still 24 hours, free wi-fi, and all the other IAG amenities.   I wouldn't consider their baked goods as gourmet as it says in the title, but.. some of them are tasty. Their coffee is not the greatest coffee ever, but it will get your coffee fixed satisfied.   I must admit though ever since they changed their name I do enjoy coming here more often because its less jam packed and I actually have a chance to sit down inside 2am in the morning.   Oh yeah drive thru service is relatively quick, out of the 6 or so times I've used it I haven't had to wait more than 3 minutes to get my order.",

That's pretty darned important for a cafe and sadly many other cafes can't say that. 2 - There is usually seating 3 - OPEN 24 HOURS! Seriously, with Vegas's reputation as the all day, all night city I thought everything would be open 24 hours. Not even close! Thankful for this place at odd hours 4 - Staff is mostly friendly and usually get the order correct 5 - Outside seating is available. Nice when it's not a hundred and hell degrees. 6 - There's a park right across the street so with that and the mountains, they have a nice view  Cons: 1 - Despite what everyone says, Wi-fi in NOT free. You have to buy a minimum amount and then get a code for a set amount of hours. Come on guys! I get it, you want people to buy and not stay if they aren't spending, but it's not costing you anything to let people use the internet. This isn't 1998.  2 - It's expensive. A large iced white mocha is about $7. That's kind of ridiculous, and yet, I pay... 3 - The owner is always around. That's not bad, per se, but he has loud conversations, plays on his laptop with the sound up, that kind of stuff.  4 - Pastries aren't too yummy. They're okay, but that's as excited as I'm going to get about it.  So, if you have the money come on over! You can not go wrong with any of the \"all time favorite\" drinks...unless you're diabetic, then just say no.  *Friend recommends the Red Velvet Mocha *I recommend the entire Cold Drink menu, but specifically the Nutella White Mocha",

I mean c'mon now- 5 stars belong to well, FIVE star businesses who represent FIVE star standards.  I'm not going to rate establishments on Forbes or AAA ratings by any means (unless it's a fine dining restaurant or a Resort), but I'm not going to just hit the five or four star button for giggles.    With that being said, I think I'm actually quite generous with MadHouse Coffee.  I'll give them the extra star based on the fact that the cafe latte that I ordered was actually pretty good.  Not EXCELLENT but good.    I would give them two stars based on the fact that the \"barista\" didn't really know what when into what.  You should really know if a certain beverage has sugar in it or not or the type of milk that goes in it.    Also when we walked in they were mopping the floors and didn't even bother to remove the bucket that was right in the middle of the place.  In such a small area - anything on the floor takes up way too much room and extremely dangerous.  Cleanliness is top notch in my book, and I appreciate the efforts to provide a clean store, however- please remove the bucket when you're done!  I didn't realize that it was still behind me when I took a step back and almost fell over it.    Aside from that, the place is pretty hip, and I'd choose their latte over Starbucks any day, but I was far from overly impressed.",

    "text": "Herbivore Review We were here about two days ago and ordered delicious (giant blended drinks), Herby asked which blended drinks were vegan and the dude behind the counter said they had a vegan powder so pretty much everything was available except a few syrups. Herby ordered a Vegan Michael Jackson, which was delicious!!  We came back to work here for the day and drink lots of coffee. Herby asked the girl behind the counter which of the flavors were vegan again and she said 'NO BLENDED DRINKS CAN BE MADE VEGAN'. Herby mentioned that we were here the other day and served vegan blended drinks, to which she just repeated that wasn't possible. So we left and drank delicious blended drinks at The Cuppa in Downtown Summerlin.  So, either MadHouse does not have vegan blended drink options and lied about it or their employees aren't properly trained about the dietary options of what they are serving. Either way, we're taking our coffee needs elsewhere.  Overall This used to be our go-to spot in Vegas for working late. We won't be back again.",

I stopped here last night because coffee bean was closed and I was getting my sick friend a chai latte. When I was ordering at the drive thru I asked if they could give me a chai latte hot and a caffe mocha also hot. The girl decided to reply pretty abruptly by informing me \" yea, both things you ordered come hot already.\" I'm not sure where this girl got her experience but people order ice mochas and chai lattes cold ALL the time which is why I specified what I wanted. Yeah thanks for the tip attitude & burnt coffee. I wont be helping pay your rude ass anymore though. Desert Wind it will stay lol",

    "text": "Great coffee, down to earth Barista's, very friendly owners (I personally met both, I was a frequent flyer though #GraduateSchoolStruggle), great food selection with *delicious* vegetarian options, down-to-earth customers, and awesome thought-provoking artwork.   When I decided to leave Las Vegas, I knew that I was also leaving a second \"home,\" I was a regular, and I always felt comfortable getting work done. There were a few times when I would get into really great conversations with Las Vegas locals, and I actually bought a good deal of artwork from Recycled Propaganda whose work you'll see around the cafe. Now that I'm settled back on the East coast, I miss my West coast staple. However, I know that it's a place that I can go to where I can feel at peace and be around good people. I even ran into friends here (and I hadn't told them about Madhouse), though people love it and they have the business to prove it.  I say all this to say that I miss Mad House, I miss the Barista's, I miss Marco and his wife, and they made it that much more difficult to move when I left. However, they will always be a shining star during my 2 years in Las Vegas. With that said, when I'm back in town vacationing, I will definitely go out of my way to drop by and say hello, and absorb the good vibes of Mad House.",

The staff did an excellent job at suggesting some of their most popular coffees abs and at explaining some of the details between drinks.  I ended up getting a white chocolate Nutella latte that was super tasty.  The guy who made it seemed to really enjoy trying to make it well too.  When he swerved it to me, he asked for me to let him know how I liked it. It's that extra care and attention and consideration that goes a long way and he seemed to sincerely want to make me a good cup of Joe. And I gotta say, he didn't disappoint. Coffee was terrific.    Next time I'm gonna try the red velvet cake latte.",

It wasn't busy when we came in so it was easier to study cause there weren't a lot of noises. So I ordered the Jasmine Tea Latte. Yes, they have tea lattes. It won't be on their menu but just ask the front for it. The latte is okay, priced pretty good. For a large (32 oz) - $4.50. The drink lacked sweetness and it was mostly milk so I was pretty disappointed about that. The staff are nice though. I forgot to tell the cashier to make it iced so he delivered a hot drink. But he was glad to replace it for the right one with a smile on his face. Overall, a great environment. They're open early. I'd come back and maybe try their fraps, especially the Nutella frap",

I personally love warm pudding, but I can buy a pack and some milk for $3. Just buy the Nutella stuff instead.",

They have a comical menu names that make it fun   I always get the Monkey Mocha and try a new menu item each time. I like how simple the menu is but yet as a lot of flavor. Sometimes cafes get to fancy and you have no idea what you are ordering   There is art all around the cafe that you can buy. Usually they are political but tasteful.  If you aren't \"hipster\" don't worry. Everyone is really nice and welcoming. All types of people come here. You people reading books, to having keyboards hooked up to a Mac making music, people doing homework or just a quick in an out. It's a fun hang out area and Has a small patio outside as well.   Wish they would open more locations up around the valley but I always stop by when I am in the area.",

    "text": "Right on Desert Inn, I made a visit at Madhouse Coffee just to cool down for awhile and order a drink. This is a casual and hip environment. I can't help but noticed the monkeys in suits and a dolly of a naked trump, haha. It made me feel like I'm in someone's dormitory. The atmosphere does feel laid back and this place gets a little more lively closer to 6. I love the music variety. They were playing hit songs like Billie Jean, Get Down On It, and there's a bit of jazz.   It's a small coffeehouse and finding a place to sit can be tricky. If it's available, they have a couple of small tables, there's also a window seating, and a counter seating. If you're getting something for to-go, they have a bench seating for you while you wait for your order. They also have one large table with cool swiveled chairs that can seat up to 8 people. This table is wide enough to have space for your laptop and do some work.  From hot and cold drinks, they also have a menu for snacks and hot food. I was in the mood for something light. I placed my order to dine in, but they had mistakenly delivered the food to my table in a to-go box. The person had offered to plate it and was very accommodating and polite. I had the Avocado Toast ($10.95), it's two sourdough bread topped with fresh sliced avocados, a calabrian red hot chili paste, and black pepper. Avocado is perfectly ripe and has no blemishes, it taste great with the mild chili paste, but it would be nice to have the bread toasted.   For drink, I tried the Japanese Matcha Blended Green Tea with no foam ($7.00), it is nicely sweetened but nothing really special. I've actually had better matcha elsewhere. And they have a dessert case with an assortment of pastry and sweet treats. I got the Croissant Bread Pudding ($4.50) which is drizzled generously with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was like a sponge bread cake, it taste soft and not overly sweet.   Overall, this is a good place to have a small group meeting, they offer free wifi, it's a cool hangout to pass time with friends and just relax. I would come here again simply because the service is friendly. My only concern is the price. On the takeout menu, it showed $7.99 for an Avocado Toast and I was charged $10.95. Not sure why the food cost is so steep for an avocado on bread.",

I ordered the Caramel Latte and Ed a cold brew w vanilla syrup. We waited a few moments and out comes the order.  I take a sip of E's cold brew....ICK.  Is there vanilla in here?  No sweetness at all and it wasnt strong.  I take a sip of my caramel latte and WTH, did they stick the entire bottle of caramel in here? I asked for 5 more pumps of vanilla for E.  Still weak but we left. Tried to mix our two together to balance it out and we just ended up pitching it.  I wanted to love this place, esp the cold brew bc that is my jam and we kinda go past it every two weeks to go to Sams Club on DI. Nope...guess I'll have to find somewhere else.",

The food is always good, the baked goods are baked fresh and always delicious as well. And for the coffee, well, I haven't been disappointed yet. Their chocolate croissants and the Nutella White Chocolate Mocha are my favorite. We love the guy Andrew that is always working there late night! He's always friendly and more than happy to answer any questions you have. Definitely going to continue coming back!!!",

I've never been over in the late hour but it turns into a hookah spot with lots of heads. Pretty funny vibe but Madhouse is a great fixture of the neighborhood.",

One great thing is they are on post mates plus which knocks the delivery fee down dramatically if your an avid post mates user like myself. There open 24 hours and the quality of there food through the am hours of ordering never changes. It's a lot better in my opinion if your a late night eater to stop by here then frequent a  24 hour McDonald's. The looney tuna sandwich on a soft croissant is lovely comfort food. There ravioli is great too. I really like island of Capri on focaccia as well. They also have fruit smoothies if your not looking for coffee and an ever changing bakery selection. I just love that there open 24 hours, have awesome food, prices, and on post mates plus. The red velvet frap is Delish and gets you moving.",

    "text": "Like a lot of places these days, the menu caters to a millennial crowd looking to try that \"something different\" food item.  The interior decor is nice and is a refreshing change from the other major coffee shops.  Free wifi.  And there are a lot of unique, interesting sounding items on the menu.   But \"sounding\" interesting is about as interesting as it gets.  I'm going to call them out on one of their signature items -- the Red Velvet Frappe.  So many Yelpers praised this unique item so highly that it naturally had to be the first thing I try -- overlooking the very high price.  YOLO, right?  What did I get -- let's call it what it is -- it is a Vanilla frappe with red dye in it.  Nothing more.  So I pay over $5 for a Vanilla frappe with red dye -- suddenly the outrageous prices by the other well known coffee chain don't look so outrageous.  As for the taste of the Frappe, it was good -- for a vanilla frappe with red dye in it.  So given that I was expecting something so much more unique and unusual, I was somewhat disappointed -- and add on that the outrageous price for the very bland, common frappe, I was left with the impression that I would not order that item again.  At first I was interested in trying all of their unusual frappe flavors -- but after experience the red velvet, I was suddenly less interested.   I also tried a couple of their macaroons and a tiramisu. Both were also good, but not so great that I would go out of my way to this place just to eat again.  Not sure I will go back.  Still think its a cool place to meet over coffee and someplace different.  But they need to maybe rethink either the pricing of their not-so-special items or make them indeed special and worth the price.  Just a friendly suggestion.",

I have been often used this cafe for deliveries, so one day my husband and I tried to visit for the first time. Maybe it's just that day for others but first impression lasts, I was disappointed and quite embarrassed for being a loyal customer, my expectations wasn't right. Attendant: The guy with the curly hair was impatient, he may had a moody day but that doesn't applied to your job! I ordered my favorite Cappuccino and then after being confused with the overwhelming menu I chose Looney Tuna. My cappuccino has no sugar, and was looking around to find but saw it inside their counter, I ended up eating first and when I got an opportunity I ask the girl to hand me sugar, it's a feeling of Finally. They look busy into something simple and they panic, I caught the two guys gossip while staring at me, how's that? At the end of the day, it's a fail, unfortunately. Not a Cool business.",

I've only been after midnight and it's usually pretty crowded, but you can find a seat. When you walk in, the first thing you'll notice is the artwork on the walls. Very interesting and gives the atmosphere a quirky and relaxed vibe. There are board games and the staff is pretty knowledgable. Everyone seems to have a good time and enjoys what they're doing.

They have an outdoor patio with a nice number of tables and seats that can accommodate big groups of people. To top it off, they're open 24/7.

The blended red velvet mocha is amazing, not to sweet and the Michael Jackson is better iced rather than hot.

We got the mad cow( hazelnut) and a white mocha. Each was very good.  This place seemed like a hangout area for people in their mid 20's to do homework and hangout. They had a nice patio to sit out and enjoy the night.  I can't wait to come back and try the red velvet mocha.",

The person in front of the register stuck out her middle finger right before we started our order.  Uhh, that's not something you do in front of customers! My brother almost thought that was towards him, but we realized she was actually talking to another employee beside us. Yup. Talking to her coworker that's off the clock while we were waiting to state our order.   Finally getting what we wanted, I was not satisfied at all.  My vanilla latte had no taste. Well, hot milk with a shot of coffee is how I'd describe it.  Tiramisu was almost okay.   It's a very small venue so there's not a lot of seating. Most of the tables and chairs are outside the coffee house. The decorations are okay and it suits the \"mad house\" concept. I guess it got the high rating cuz of the hipster feel of it which attracts people.  And everyone wants to be a damn hipster these days..",

I crave coffee at all hours and it is amazing here. Prices are fair compared to Starbucks and the flavors are different. I love a place with Monkey Mocha and Red Velvet. Oh BTW, hot red velvet mocha just stole first place as my favorite of all time hot coffees. It used to belong to Starbuck's marble mocha macchiato. The drive thru is rarely busy, which is how I order most of the time, but they do have some stellar food here. I've had a couple things and they are all made in house. Try it out, I love it.",

I like it when their music is chill or jazz, anything without lyrics so you can hear each other talking better and be able to read/work better too. :) ......The drinks are delicious, from light and refreshing Italian sodas to succulent hot coffee drinks (served in glass mugs if you wish) to decadent blended coffee(or not) drinks  I don't find it a small thing that they use the tiny, almost crushed, ice cubes (No pun intended.)  It makes iced drinks so much more delicious to me. Lots of sweets/pastries, including chocolates made in house.(but the treats are priced quite high.).   The Green Card sandwich (turkey, cheddar, bacon and guacamole) was delish....  Various healthy and vegan choices, even almond , coconut, and hemp milk for your drinks.   The coffee beans' flavor is so rich and not bitter.....Lots of outdoor seating (but see \"cons\")...... They allow dogs (not just service dogs), even inside.  And will provide water for them if asked.    Cons:  a ridiculously hard to read menu because of how it's organized.  You are charged for water, even if you order plenty of other things too.... And the prices are a little high, especially for the quality/quantity of the food.  The pics on the monitor that show the food have a lot more meat on the sandwiches, etc.  The tuna sandwich is tasteless and dripping in mayo-type spread.  The herbal tea choices are sparse....Although the outdoor seating is plentiful, there is almost no shade, so if it's hot out, it's pretty miserable.  You are also quite squeezed in next to other tables.....The hookah service/coal changes is very slow or nonexistant.  And even for everything else, you usually have to go to the counter to get any new items, etc.  It's not that the servers don't want to help you; they are just understaffed, so the staff is either very friendly or slightly annoyed.  Wish they had board games like the Eastern location.  If they do, I've never seen them.... If you are expecting to always get out of the drive-thru quick, you shouldn't.  These people make delicious drinks and have attention to detail.   This isn't McDonald's or that other place with the burnt beans.  ;)",

With art covering the walls and a quirky type of jazz coming out of the speakers, the atmosphere is simultaneously fun and mellow with friendly baristas to match. Small groups will find it more spacious outside on the patio, but there are a few tables inside. Solo sippers have more freedom with all the counters and barstools along the walls. If you don't intend to get cozy, MadHouse also has a drive-thru; if you do, it's open all day and all night.  Their sizes have normal names! A medium blended drink comes in a 24-ounce cup, the equivalent of a Starbucks venti in size, but its contents are full of creativity and taste. Their grasshopper is a subtly minty mocha combination. I like their crushed coconut mocha, but have much more of their menu to try. I've only indulged in their blended drinks, but their brewed coffees and sandwiches tempt me every time!   If you want to use their internet, let them know when you order and you'll receive a one-time use code. The time limit is based on how much you spend (e.g. $4-7 = one hour of WiFi, $10+ = four hours), so the more you pay, the longer your WiFi privileges stay.   I haven't settled on a favorite drink yet, but I've discovered my new perch.",

It's also cool that they have milk alternatives for those who are allergic or just looking for something different (almond, hemp, coconut).  UPDATE. I decided to try a medium iced vanilla coconut latte, and it was WAY too sweet for me.

The whole cup was filled with flakes, I thought I could skim them off the top, no such luck. I tip because I know it's American standard, but this cup was not worth the 6 minutes of wait and the 8 dollars I paid for it. If it was a few flakes, I could understand. But when she served me the cup she was laughing,  I thought nothing of it until I started to drink it. Clearly intentional, since I been to the only one in Vegas,  at around the same time and the cups just got worse and worse until this, Just pathetic. Never going back.",

    "text": "Eh, I'll probably give them another try at least, but I am not super impressed.  Did the drive through yesterday, ordered the Nutella White Chocolate blended mocha. Came to $5.98 for the smallest size which I thought was way high even for coffee house prices. Worst part, is I don't actually think I got the right drink. It tasted nothing like Nutella or White Chocolate. It tasted like a regular mocha and had chucks of milk chocolate throughout the whole drink. It wasn't bad, but just seemed nothing like what I was supposed to get??  The reason I think I will probably come back is I didn't actually realize you could get different milks. I missed that on the menu, and I am lactose intolerant (took a pill to have the drink I got) and it would have been great to not have to worry about that. Not sure if there is an upcharge for that through. If so, I am not really sure these drinks would be worth an even higher price.",

    "text": "So, we're leaving lunch when the coffee craving hits me and I pull up Yelp to find MadHouse Coffee. The whole way there, I'm thinking I have been here before, and not until we pulled up did I realize we came here a few years back when it was It's A Grind. From what I remember, it's definitely changed. It's a fairly small spot and even though it's a little hipsterish, I dig the art on the walls and some of the quirky little knick-knacks lining the counter.  The menu here is pretty big and naturally, the first thing that caught my eye was the mention of Nutella in multiple items. They've got quite a few unique items too like mocha frappes in Cake Batter, Red Velvet and my pick, the Monkey Mocha, which is peanut butter and banana. While both the peanut butter and banana flavor were really good in the drink, it was a way too watered down for me. The wifey had the Cake Batter Mocha and it was so insanely sweet, I don't even know how she drank it. I also got what they call the Nutellamisu and wasn't a huge fan. It didn't taste anything like Nutella and I think it may have been old. It was ok, but the taste just wasn't right and the ladyfinger portion of it was super soggy.  My biggest reasoning for the two stars is the employees. Whenever I go somewhere that has an open kitchen or whatever you call it in a coffee shop, I tend to watch what everyone's doing. Not because I want to nitpick, but because I'm legitimately interested and intrigued by what goes on back there. So, as I'm sitting there watching the two people back there work, I notice the girl keeps eating food behind the counter. And she kept doing that thing where when you eat something crumbly, you're almost putting your fingers in your mouth to catch it. Well, after she does that...she goes right to making something else and touching other food that was for a customer in the drive thru. Coupled with their not so friendly attitudes, it seemed weird and gross to me that she's back there eating, but not washing her hands. It was enough for me not to want to try anything else on the menu, including the sandwiches, which looked pretty good too by the way.  Prices aren't terrible, but they aren't great either. A medium blended drink will set you back about $6, which made our total bill just under $18 with two mochas and the Nutellamisu. For me, there was very little to like here and unless I was in the area at some weird hour craving coffee, I probably won't be coming back.",

But, time and time again (and I am talking like more than 10 times) when I order a medium drink, they have made and charged me for a large and passed it off as an accident.  That wasn't really a big enough problem to steer me away until an incident today..  I found some old Free Drink vouchers that was given to me by the owner when the coffee shop was just opening. It specifically said \"No Strings Attached\", and there was also no expiration date on it.   I gave it to the cashier girl who said she would be back with my percentage total. I was confused as there was no \"percentage off\" on it. It was point blank FREE DRINK NO STRINGS ATTACHED.    So an older man appeared and asked where I got them, I said the owner gave them to us. He said he is the owner. I told him it was a female. He said that the vouchers were a few years old. I said there is no expiration on it. He left and then the female owner came to window.  She was nice. She asked where/when those were given to us. I definitely didn't expect her to remember us, she gave them to us in passing at Paymons Hookah Lounge, years ago. We reminded her, and she remembered and apologized.   Another cashier girl came to the window and said that our total was $8.45. And I said again the vouchers were for free drinks, and she said that those were made for drinks under $4. (Again reminder, NO STRINGS ATTACHED, and no fine print at all). We canceled the order, and she was annoyed and about to tell me they couldn't do that, but then the female owner appeared again and apologized.. But super quietly and said she gets I'm trouble for those all the time.  Man I felt bad for having put her through that, and I feel awful she has to deal with whomever the male owner is to her..   But I let them keep the vouchers because I truly have no more intentions of ever returning. There are too many other cool coffee shops in this town with nice owners. Makers & Finders for instance. And they just opened up their second shop over at the Summerlin mall.",

Food I was not a fan of but gotta give credit to the management it has improved in the past years. The new toasts with avocado, if served freshly, are quite yummy and healthy. Management is very lively experimenting with candies and pastries coming up with some eclectic fusion forms that are surprising in its appearance but not much in the taste. It's on the level though. Don't get me wrong. You can feel a creative drive there. Local artist's Recycled Propaganda little exhibition is there permanently with sporadic painting rotations. Unique Vegas vibe with nice view of the Valley and extravagant European influence. Excuse typos. Written using voice to text.",

Probably the best thing about MadHouse is the atmosphere and the fact that they are open late. If you're not going here for one of those two things then I'm not sure I see the point. You might be better off just going to the Starbucks across the street. Hope this place goes back to the way I remember it being soon!",

(Clark county library system, I'll return those books soon.)   Ok, so Madhouse has a great vibe from the art work on the wall to the friendly and colorful people who work there. When I first started going, I'd go through their drive thru and R2D2 would great me! Being a STAR WARS geek, that was THE BEST THING EVER!!! I'm not gonna lie, that may have been the main reason I kept returning. But seriously, their coffee is scrumptious. I've tried their red velvet, their mad max, their white mocha, mad cow and cake batter. All good, but I am a repeat offender of their mad max. It has blended coffee beans in it so its got more texture than your usual blended drinks. Like I said, all drinks are good.   So if you're ever in the vicinity of this place, definitely stop by and try their drinks!",

We bought the last two blue berry muffins from the display box but because our server didn't put them aside while making our pour overs, and so some other lucky customer bought them.  The explanation, not an apology, was that they sold out and asked if banana nut would do. Oh well, we reluctantly agreed since the pour over is still waiting to be made.  Finally we got our pour over coffee and it wasn't anything to write home about, and our banana nut muffin was no where in sight.  We inquired at the counter and the cashier was clueless.  Then we heard someone yelled it is in the oven.  They were brought out to our table immediately.  The bottom of the muffin are burnt and the parchment paper wrapper was so crispy dry that it breaks in your hands.  It is a mad house alright and enter at your own risk....",

I got the Nutella white choc mocha (pictured) based on the reviews and the crushed coconut mocha the next day because anything coconut is delicious. Both didn't disappoint. I went in the first day and was so intrigued with the witty art. Didn't get to take photos or explore much due to my daughter being hurt, we rushed out of there. Went to the drive thru the next day and they were super friendly and quick. Will come back again to try their other coffees. Also, curious if their food is good. Will update. So far, 5 stars for me!",

It doesn't have the best coffee drinks I've ever tasted in my life, but he atmosphere is worth it. It's just very... chill. The baristas are always friendly and so are the patrons. You can almost always find someone interesting to talk to when you're bored. Has very limited seating on the inside, but also offers an outdoor patio - with plenty more space to sit.   Obviously being one of the only 24 hour coffee shops in the area, it gets pretty busy at night.",

I love the fact that you can turn any sandwich into a salad, but the portions seem to vary depending who makes your order. A 24hr joint is always cool in my book though I never really find myself anywhere in the wee hours these days. But no matter the hour, there's always some people in here of any age group.. especially college kids gettin' their study on. They used to have those Man Beefcake protein snacks. Kiiiiiiinda wish they'd have them again, but at the same time I don't come here often enough to take advantage of it either--nor does the rest of their food really go with the fitness/protein bit anyway. Four stars because I don't really believe a 20oz iced Nutella almond milk latte should really cost almost $8 but then again..

Just somewhere to hang out and have a conversation.   I had never been to MadHouse but having it be 24 hours and relatively close to our location, it sounded like a good choice. As we parked in front of the shop, the first thing we saw was a crowd of about ten high schoolers who looked like they just turned eighteen and were celebrating the fact they could now buy cigarettes. After walking through their cloud of smoke and having to reach around someone to try to reach the door handle to open the door because they were blocking the entrance, we were greeted with bright, artistically modern colors and designs that reminded me of the old nineties stick figure character with his \"box\" like dog.   The staff was very friendly towards everyone, including the drunk teen who had come stumbling in and just wanted to use the restroom. We were told suggestions of what was popular and I ordered the coconut mocha which was excellent. We decided to sit inside due to the cloud of smoke and teenagers outside. Overall, a nice place to hang out and order a different kind of coffee. Expect a younger crowd with a few older peeps thrown in. I would definitely go again.",

    "text": "First of all, wow. That is the first word that popped into my head when I saw there was a 24-hour coffee shop a mile from my house. That small \"wow\" soon turned into a caps-locked, bolded, underscored \"WOW!!!\" after I actually got there. When I got there the first thing that caught my affection was the atmosphere. They had some light alternative rock playing (Goo Goo Dolls to be specific..) which I really enjoy. Even at this very moment that have some light vocal jazz playing, both are great choices to just come in, chill, and sip on a delicious drink. There is ample seating to accommodate everyone for the most part, even when it was really busy I had a seat at the window.  I didn't even make it to the menu before noticing the desert counter. Homemade French macaroons, muffins, tiramisu, croissants, plenty of delicious choices to satisfy anyones' tastes. Also any bakery that can appreciate the value of Nutella in deserts is boss, so kudos for the Nutellamisu! Very creative! They also have a few bagels too, and some branded products available for purchase.  Where do I even begin with the drinks? Well for starters they have a larger, more inventive selection than ANY other coffee shop I have seen, especially dumpy corporate chain stores like Starbucks and Coffee Bean. Iced coffee is my usual poison, and they do it deliciously. They have some iced teas, blended drinks, everything you can imagine! The Japanese Matcha Green Tea is a tad pricey, but done beautifully. Definitely worth it in my book.  I have only tried one sandwich, and I am unable to tear myself away from it to try anything else, the Chicken Parmigiana is too good to be True! I can only imagine the other sandwiches are just as good, this one just hits all of the right spots! Fresh ingredients and a real homemade feel make the food what it is.  There are a few downfalls, but they are just personal preferences so I cant take off any points, but I feel they are worth a mention:  1) No iced coffee/tea refills on same day, same stay visits. Iced coffee and tea are pretty cheap, and I enjoy sitting here all day sipping on some, and it is kind of a drag to have to pay full price each time I want to get some more. Maybe a half off discount for same day visits? I would be more tempted to spend the extra cash on a treat for myself anyways, so it isn't like the profit wouldn't be there.  2) All-day internet restrictions. I understand the space crunch during peak hours, but the time I tend to come there isn't anyone ever here. Most of the time I am not sitting on the internet anyways, I am working on something on my laptop. My one hour card I get usually merits me about 5 minutes of use total during this time. Again, not a big deal.   3) Music volume, as some other people have said. I like a little ambiance, turn it down maybe just a little? It just seems a tad too loud during the day, but again, this is just me. I don't mind just throwing in my own headphones and continuing to work away!  Other than those three things, the staff is amazing, atmosphere is top-notch, and product is absolutely delicious. I will be moving in a week or so, and I couldn't be more sad to not be living a mile from this place. I will be sure to come back and visit and bring friends as much as I can! Keep up the good work guys! :)  To anyone who reviewed this place at 3 stars or less, pull the stick out of your ass, you'll never find another place this amazing in Las Vegas, or all of Nevada for that matter.",

Only gripe is it's small, usually busy and can be hard to find a table to get some work done.  I guess that is a good problem to have!",

    "text": "This is my first review so please bare with my inexperience.   My 5 star rating comes from multiple factors: service, taste, environment, hours, and convenience.  Service is talkative, quick, and precise. All the staff are willing to make weird concoctions I dream up of. For example, hot chocolate over ice with a caramel topping bottomed cup (greatest invention since I'm extremely sensitive to caffeine and usually show up here at 3am). Marco the manager always talks to customers, asking for opinions, and looking for ways to make the place a little more comfortable.  The taste of the coffee here is a well balance of savory, bitter, and sweet. Desserts here are made in-house and very fresh. The sandwiches are always great. But what brings me here is the Tiramisu and Nutellamisu, both made in house. Perfect accompaniment to a hot drink in the twilight hours.   I really love the environment here: lounge-ish, calm, hip hop, dance, trance music always playing in the background provides a mildly serene vibe for me. I'm usually here in the wee-hours of the night to study, normal hours are usually crowded so you might have to find your niche in time slots. 24/7 cafe and free wifi with purchase really make this place the perfect package. I'd recommend In The Grind on W. Desert Inn to EVERYONE.",

For those coffee lovers, try their Red Velvet or Nutella White Chocolate, either hot or cold blended is great. For US tea drinkers, I love their iced mango green tea. Not as sweet as the ones you get at Spring Mountain. I also love their Mango and Green Tea smoothie. They have great desserts. I remembered ordering a blueberry muffin and after tasting it, ordered a second one for my boyfriend because I didn't wanna share mine. Their french macaroons were great too - bigger than the ones you get in other coffee houses. All their desserts are made-in-house. Their sandwiches are filling, reasonably priced at $5.75, and made in-house too. Not some reheated pre-made sandwich. They have indoor, outdoor, and drive-thru. Open 24 hours and has free wi-fi. They also have hookah - outdoors only and they have doggie treats and bowl for your four-legged best friend - outdoors only too. What else can you ask for?",

The staff is friendly, and accommodating.  I love to patronize local coffee shops, but often without the corporate training program what you get are a couple of teenage employees more interested in talking about the latest MTV reality show than making your coffee.  That is not the case here.  They are quick and professional.  This morning the cashier was straightening some product, and apologized for making me wait.  They always make my drink correctly, and bring it to me rather than calling my name to pick it up at the counter.  I don't come here often enough to be a regular so I assume they do this for everybody.  The radio is at a normal level, and typically tuned to a non-offensive jazz station.  Again I have been to independents where the employees are apt to have something on the radio that makes me want to leave ASAP.  Obviously management at this place has a clue.  They also carry cigarettes.  While I don't smoke, and find it disgusting I think it is awesome that they carry something that includes everybody.  Where I grew up all independent coffee house carried cigarettes.  This is a great bonus, and adds to the authenticity of the place.  I don't live close by, but I do go out of my way to be her.  I almost forgot to mention the product.  It is far superior to what you would get at the corporate concept places.  They have numerous dairy substitutes as well rather than just nasty soy milk.  This is a huge bonus.  I recommend this place all the time.",

The food is always good. I have truly NEVER sampled anything I have not enjoyed. The staff is diverse. Always a pleasure to deal with and very personable. The owner always has time for a little conversation between making sure everything is up to par. Great place , great staff. You will see some reviews by people who are just negative people and do not get the concept of business. It is a great place to relax and enjoy eats and drinks with friends. Some ignorant people however believe it is acceptable to spend 3 dollars on a drink and take up space for multiple hours, limiting space for other patrons to purchase, causing some to go elsewhere. How can a great place stay opened with those types frequenting an establishment? Then again no one ever said the world was filled with intelligent people. My overall review is this is a must stop by for those looking for something that separates itself from the corporate norm of coffee houses. A True 5 star! Thank you Marco for bring a truly unique place to Vegas!",

After meeting friends and sitting for about 10 minutes, a man with glasses who described himself as the owner asks my friends if they are ready to order. No menu was given, no greeting or any form of hospitality. They decided they fight wan to order right then, and although I happened to be waiting for a menu or options, he decided to ask us all to leave. Stating he has \"a business to run\"while having plenty of open seating around us was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. Extremely unprofessional, rude, and downright nasty business etiquette.",

The atmosphere is that of something one would see at Life is Beautiful, with pieces of Recycled Propaganda art hanging everywhere (most available for purchase), and a very crowded but cozy nature. I purchased an Earl Grey tea with honey, nothing very special, and it was good, as Earl Grey would be. This place looks and feels much better than a Starbucks, and for both the experience of the place and the options of food (they have coffee, tea, and food like sandwiches and salads!) that they provide, I would pick this over Starbucks any day. Definitely will be coming back.",

    "text": "Not sure what to make of this place. I decided to head to MadHouse last night after getting crappy information from Sambalatte that they were open until 10pm (Yelp had the right info, stating they close at 8pm on Sun/Mon/Tue).  For some strange reason, I ordered a medium Monkey Mocha. It's basically mocha with banana and peanut butter. Extremely sweet, but that was to be expected. The peanut butter dominated the drink's flavor. Their medium size is 24oz - the same as the oddly named \"venti\" at Star$. Their large is 32oz; that's one whole ounce more than the also oddly named \"trenta\" at Star$!  Anyway, the place has a cool vibe. For 9pm on a Monday night, it was full of people, both inside and outside. Many of the patrons were on their laptops taking advantage of the free wi-fi. I'd probably return simply for the fact that they are open 24 hours and it's a good place to have a nice conversation. It's also closer to my place than Sambalatte.  I do like me some tiramisu and they have an interesting variation on it - Nutellamisu. Hmm. Maybe I should try making that.",

It's only like $17.95 for the hookah. And they have quite a variety of coffee and drinks. My FAV here is the mad cow (hazelnut latte) or the blended monkey drink I don't really remember the name but it was SO GOOD OMG like I wanted to buy another after I finished it LOL but they do offer almond milk alternatives or soy or just regular . They also have a bunch Of sandwiches you can order to eat if you're Hungry or even macaroons or Nutella tiramisu as desserts but this place has a variety of stuff and there's tons of places to sit so you don't have to worry about standing to drink your coffee and that's what I love about this place the most besides how friendly all the staff always are so I'd definitely recommend. This is always my go to place if i ever crave sweets in the middle of the night",

Wifi is made available only to paying customers (understandable), but on an incremental system. Spend $4-$7 and get 1 hour.   Value has been shifted from the customer to the customer's wallet and has made madhouse more of a \"get in and get out\" coffee shop than a \"come enjoy a drink and get some work done\" shop.  Madhouse has lost much of its appeal and I have switched to nearby competitors, independent and corporate, who offer a relaxed atmosphere, fair coffee, and unlimited wifi.",

The mad cow latte and the red velvet mocha are the ones to definitely try; if you don't want something out of the ordinary. When it comes to their sandwiches I would recommend the innocent bystander (turkey, chipotle mayo, lettuce, melted mozzarella) and the madhouse which is similar but, instead of turkey it has chicken breast and mushrooms in it. The drive thru service is so-so but, they do seem to get very busy even at nights. It's a pretty cool place to get a quick grab to eat or to just chill and hang out with friends.",

It was great, sandwich was delicious and filling, coffee was rich and delicious. What was not so great was those two items together cost 13$ and some change. A little on the expensive side if you ask me.   However, if you are looking for a great cup of coffee or a delicious sandwich, and do not mind the prices, I highly recommend this groovy joint.

I ordered a red velvet drink and was disappointed at how basic it tasted. Starbucks provides better tasting drinks for actually a cheaper price. The reason I came here was to study and do HW and to switch it up since I usually go to Starbucks or Coffee Bean to do my studies. SO, I go to do my hw on my laptop and the wifi password they told me wasn't working. I tried about 20 times doing capital letters lowercase etc., but it just wasn't connecting. I asked the guy up front if the wifi was working and he kind of gave me attitude and was like \"uhh it should be working?!!\" I told him the password wasn't working both on my laptop and on my phone and so he went to the back to check if the wifi was on and it was. He basically told me \"sucks to suck\" and there was nothing he could do for me to get the wifi working for my devices. He didn't even try to make sure everything was connected right on his end. So I drove all the way across town bought a 7 dollar drink, tipped them, and couldn't even do any of my homework and ended up going to Starbucks and spending more money buying drinks so that I could use their wifi.",

I said NOT for what you just put me through! Further the disgusting owner did not tell me it was more money before he prepared it to give to me! Then I asked for my money back and he refused to refund me or to replace the food item which I already gave back to him. I basically had nothing and he stole the amount of money that I paid him for my order! This man is a PIG! He was also harassing me in the drive through verbally when I told him I was calling the police! I am also going to press charges against this sick man for harassment with the intent to defraud a customer and steel money and not deliver a product in exchange! After I called the police and left the drive through, I hit a curb and ruined my wheel on my car because I was so angry and distraught!

Looks like they have a good selection of sweets. I'll try their pastries next time. Hopefully the cashier will be much friendlier. Seems like it's also a very nice place to just hang out or do your school stuff. Looks like there are outlets everywhere for laptops and phones.",

We even pulled around for a cop who only ordered one drink lol. We ordered 2 sandwiches which were great and also a vegan sweet potato. It comes with a sauce that's usually the best part, but i was really disappointed when i opened it to see there was no sauce, just a dry sweet potato that they threw tomatoes on lol. I never like pointing stuff like this out and i know they work really hard, I just wish they would've at least said something like they were out of the sauce instead of having us wait 20 minutes in the drive thru for a dry, not even seasoned with salt or pepper potato :/",

I went in a couple of months ago and they weren't very friendly but the other day I had a bad experience. The guy taking our order(red head) didn't offer a smile or anything and was rushing us to finish. We ordered our things and most of it came out within ten minutes. Five minutes after they arrived I went up to ask for our croissant and bread pudding and one of the workers apologetically said he'd get it. As he walked behind the counter, the guy who'd taken our order says, \"it's already being warmed up!!!!\" 1. He saw me waiting there to ask and avoided me so 2. Why didn't he help me? 5 minutes later(it's already been 20 minutes since we've ordered and half my coffee is gone) I go up and ask if we can have our stuff. He says, \"it's already warmed up we've just been busy!!!\" He proceeds to roll his eyes, slam things around while looking for the croissant then hands it to me with a, \"here you go!\"   I was appalled at his actions and upset that we spent our money there for such horrible service and even more upset we'd tipped them $4.   I will never go to Mad House again.   PS: this is the first bad review I've ever written",

So, I thought dammit!  One Star already.  I sucked everything up and just drove to their cafe.  I picked up the menu and looked around.  The employee asked if I called earlier and I said yes.  He apologized that he gave me the wrong website.  I could've been a douche and kept digging in to him but decided not to.  Luckily, I didn't because he and all his colleagues were all very kind and easy going, not just with me but with other patrons.  I ordered a white chocolate mocha frappaccino and boy was it what I needed on a hot day like Friday.  My boss ordered the Madhouse sandwich but turned it in to a wrap.  That's another awesome thing is that they will make what you want and how you want it.  That, I thought, was reason enough to come back again.  My boss really liked the wrap and asked how much it all cost.  She said it all tasted expensive, which is a good thing.  Majority of the time expensive means yumm-o!",

The Mad Cow coffee is delicious and not comparable to Starbucks but the prices are higher than Starbucks but worth it if you are a coffee drinker. The staff is also nice and the big plus is that it is open 24 hours a day.",

Also food is over priced I get a small croissant sandwich with just egg and cheese for $11... that's ridiculous. Also ordered ice Nutella coffee and it was extremely sweet and wasn't cold it was warm and I asked for an ICED coffee. The only good thing I like here is the red velvet mocha. Staff can sometimes be rude depending who it is but this place is okay. Also If they keep your ID for the hookah you won't get it back unless you remember. My friend left her ID with them and they don't even call you to let you know they just keep it and when she went back in to get it the guy pulled it out of a stack of ID's and credit cards. Like you should give back the ID when they are done with the hookah or don't ask for it if they are just going to keep it for their collection.",

I appreciate the milk alternatives: Almond, soy, hemp, and coconut - thank you!   There's a house blend and drip which is okay, anything expresso will have you bouncing off the walls and that's ok for me :) most drinks are super sweet, the pastries look promising but I've only had a blueberry muffin which was just ok. The service is slow and sometimes the staff is unorganized, so I dunno, it's an ok spot to have coffee I guess and chill out for a bit.",

They have whatever coffee and tea options you would be interested in. They also offer breakfast sandwiches and other pastries. You may also order a hookah although I didn't see anyone smoking hookah there.  Overall, just an average coffee shop.",

    "text": "This place is a dream come True! A seriously cute neighborhood coffee shop that is open 24 hours and offers unique and incredible coffee, drinks, food and bakery goods - enough said!   I ordered the iced coconut latte (which is not even on the menu), but the cashier and the barista were very friendly and more than happy to oblige.  Love at first sip! It was super icy, cold, and deep in flavor! Delicious hint of decadent coconut, just the right amount of creamy milk, and the perfect amount of expresso. It wasn't too sweet - it was refreshing and perfect. The caffeine packed a punch and I was jumping off the walls in a good way!  I was extremely happy with my drink. I had to get up and compliment and thank my barista multiple times before we left. She mentioned that she added a few dashes of mocha in it as well, so that I can tell the barista how to make it the next time I come in. I'm so in love with this drink!   The Japanese matcha green tea smoothie is also too legit to quit. I can agree with the other yelpers when they say it's pricey ($6 small/ $9 large) but man, is it sweet, icy cold and addicting. The matcha flavor is bold and it's right up there with Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's (CBTL) green tea ice blended drink. They both taste like rich, creamy and dreamy matcha ice cream. It's about $3 cheaper at CBTL, but still, whichever is closer is the winner in my opinion. Though, Madhouse is open 24/7 so it's great for after hour cravings.   We also ordered a matcha white chocolate macaroon. It was huge, sweet and yummy. I didn't really taste the matcha, but the white chocolate flavor came through strong.  Thank you Madhouse for being wonderful and a diamond in the rough.  Super PRO TIP: They have Affogato! Made with supremely rich and luscious Intelligentsia Expresso - we had it with  Sugar Glider Intelligentsia Expresso which is a once a year kind of deal and it is exquisite. Try it!",

Which is a large ice americano with splash of coconut milk and 2 pumps of sugar free vanilla. Went to the paying window the lady ask for $8.50 i was like u joking right??? $8.50 do u realize i can get 2 large coffee in that price anywhere else??!! So i change my mind and ask for a small that cost $4.60 also way too much. Than a different lady came super rude and racist said next look at the price list cause it waist of coffee and she slame the window at my face! I understand u a small place need to make money but it dosen't mean u need to be rude over charge Pepole for tiny coffee! Charging Pepole $1 for splash of coconut milk cause I'm allergic to regular milak products. I'm a business women too and a fly all the time never paid $8 for a coffee not even at the airport when they over charged!! U guys are definitely a madhouse and unbelievable Pepole go there and pay this prices. NEVER AGAIN OR AND JUST FOR U TOO KNOW THE CLIENTS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT!! so u can waist your coffee if a client ask for a different size to make him happy!!",

I asked if it was supposed to be that watery and she said she can remake it so I asked for more ice in it so it's thicker, well it came back even more watered down and less ice! For Pete's sake, how hard is it to make an ice blended beverage?!? Add more ice like I asked. Geezuz! I'm so tired of wasting money at this place. Always driving out of my way for this is just ridiculous.  Waste of time, waste of a drive and waste of money! I threw that thing in the garbage!",

Told them and they poured into a paper cup. Easy enough. Then I drink it. It's a regular white mocha. I let them know. And dude literally just puts pistachio powder on top and stirs and says here you go. Wtf let's be real. I just waited 15 minutes and paid 7 bucks for that drink. You ain't half assing nothing. Give me money. I'm out. I Don't want the $5 off next visit. If y'all don't care about my order this time around, why would I come back?",

It's a very small place so if you plan to study with more than 3 people you should either be there early or sit outside.   They do have a drive thru so be aware of your order. We ordered a green tea and it took almost one hour to even get it. We had to ask a couple of the workers about it since we had already been seated for quite sometime.   To get the wifi you need to make a purchase. Which we all did, but the downside to this is it only lasts two hours. With so many rules plus the forgetting of the green tea and the kid music, I don't recommend this coffee shop to come and study to if you're studying for an important exam or with a big group of people.",

    "text": "First impression of this place was NOT my style. This is a place for hipsters in my opinion.  However, the staff was friendly and the place was clean-ish. I took my grandma there for lunch.  She ordered a Mango Smoothie and a vegetarian burger. I ordered the BLT and a vanilla blended drink.  When I got to the table I was taken back that it was almost $50!!!!! For a coffee shop?!?!?! I thought that was insane. They didn't give me a receipt so i went back up to ask for a receipt. They dont print them, so i opted for a texted receipt. I was charged for an extra drink. What seemed to be the owner (who took our order) apologized and had someone else fix the mistake. He blamed it on the staff saying that they did it. You could tell the rest of the staff was annoyed with him. I'm sure if I worked there I would be annoyed with him as well (you'll understand why further on in the review) Just apologize and fix the problem, dont blame your staff or point fingers. That's just bad for business.  My grandma got her burger first and then about five minutes later I got my BLT. I had to ask about the drinks because we still had not received them. This place was not busy enough to be forgetting to make drinks. A few minutes later the drinks were there. We took a couple bites of each and a few sips... Man, everything was DELICIOUS! I was not expecting that. (The major reason for so many stars) The owner (I think, because of his attitude) came over to apologize for charging me for an extra drink. He said that they took off the more expensive one and charged me for the cheaper one which wasn't the drink I  ordered. Implying that i got a discount. I was looking straight at the receipt in black and white and they were the same price. He then corrected me and said he gave me a deal. Ummm... NO, i am literally looking at the receipt. But, I didn't feel like arguing so i just said thanks. Grandma's smoothie didn't have whipped cream on it. He had asked her if she wanted it when we ordered, and she said yesssssss please. (That too was on the receipt) So they fixed that and came back with a tiramisu for us to take home. Grandma LOVES her sweets, so she was excited. But when we got home, she tried it and said it was stale and no good.  Our lunch was delicious, overpriced but delicious. Unfortunately, we probably will not be returning. Too many negatives. But I did give 3 stars for the great sandwiches.",

Some of the food, though, are a bit hit and miss, like the pastries. The vegan brownie left an odd aftertaste and the tiramisu had a weird texture. It is a small venue and the place can get packed, especially late night.",

I would say the artworks were Satirical street art about Political and Social commentary.  It was an interesting place look at all the artwork.  They have sandwiches, pastries, and some specialty drinks.  I ordered the Italian Hot Chocolate. It was thicker than regular hot chocolate.  It taste a little bit like Fudge, but not as sweet.  A story when I first went to Madhouse Coffee. A man walk into the cafe late at night.  He probably wanted to escape the cold that night.  He had a sandwich with him so he ate that and sat around.  From his appearance, he didn't seem like he had a lot to his name.  I saw two of the Cafe's Workers come over and give him a sandwich, a hot beverage, and pastries.  The man look a little taken aback and wasn't sure what to do.  It was so nice of the Workers to do that act of kindness for him~^_^",

I mean, a vegetarian burger that bleeds? I must experience this.  The service was pretty subpar. No smile. I can't settle for no smile. I ordered an almond milk latte to enjoy in the space. When it was brought out the latte art was disappointing. Maybe they aren't known for that, but with so many cafes throughout town that do, I was expecting it. The espresso blend was a bit bitter and overall. It was also really pricey. With tip, I paid over $6 for my latte.   They do offer free wi-fi for a few hours, so that's a plus. MadHouse isn't on my must go back list, but it's not out of the running.",

The chocolate \"gluten-free\" muffins are worthy of breaking your diet for. The potato gnocchi dish is pretty decent.  But dishes and drinks are pretty uneven. You might get an AMAZING coffee or sandwich one day, but the next week, it is \"meh.\" They made me an extraordinary Americano with chocolate but then could not reproduce it, no matter how many times I gave the same instructions. It is a hip place with interesting people working and coming through there. And it is a fine place to study (if loud music does not bother you). But it is not without imperfections.",

One experience I'd like to share is when I drank their Matcha Latte everyday for a month. I gained 3 pounds in a month, yet that was the only change to my prior diet. It's a high calorie drink, at I think around 500-700 calories per drink. So beware of the matcha latte - I wish i had known.  Also it's open 24/7. I can't even count the amount of  times I've gone to pick up their raw vegan brownies in the wee hours of the night..",

So why is my drink over $8.00 add in a $2.00 tip because I'm not a cheapskate and one drink costs over $10.00.  I don't care what I have in it, the kind of milk, how much syrup, no drink has any excuse to be that expensive. With those prices I expect that the espresso being used has been walked over from Ethiopia.  I will from now on as my personal mission find local places I can get a large latte and a croissant for around $10. I used to love this place but makes no sense when I can go to The Bucks and get the same drink for HALF the price.",

It does really have that \"madhouse\" feel, but as for a coffee shop to do some studying or work in... I would never get anything done. The area is too small filled with many tables. I did notice that there were a lot of outlets which had USB ports.   As for the menu... it was so clustered I couldn't really understand it and some of the writing was so small I couldn't read it!  The lady who took my order was very nice and I ordered a coconut mocha. I ordered mine with non fat milk and no whip cream. The drinks were good!  I feel like this coffee shop would be great near a college or in a college town as it seems to be for that age group (especially since there's hookah).",

I've tried some macarons and I think they are mediocre. The best thing I like about MadHouse Coffee is the ambience of their coffee shop.

I now can compare this shop to other coffee shops and chains around town, and hands down this is some of the best coffee I've ever had. One time I went to Dunkin's right around the corner, took a few sips and it was bad. I like Dunkin's but something wasn't right. They tried to remake it and were so nice but I pulled out of their parking lot and came straight to Mad House and that's when I learned.   Mad House offers so many flavors and milk alternatives. The milk alternatives include soy, almond, coconut, & Hemp. They also make their pastries and desserts in house and can I highly recommend the Vegan Brownie!! AMAZING! They also offer hookah, open 24 hours, have WiFi for customers and a patio that is puppy friendly!",

It's a very \"hip\" place with all the cool decorations and food creations. Even the bathroom is awesome! It's black light and the walls are covered in glowing art. It gets very busy here especially in the evening but the workers are very good at getting your order out fast. I've tried the red velvet, the Nutella, the caramel, and the monkey mocha and they're all very good. My all time favorite is the monkey mocha! It's a chocolate peanut butter banana mocha and it comes blended. None of the flavors are overpowering it's a nice blend and the flavors complimented each other well. I have yet to try any of their food but I plan on it next time. Also, you can rent hookah from them and it's pretty cool to just chill at night with some friends, coffee, and hookah. Highly recommend this place as a spot to chill and just for their great coffee.",

Because I don't eat meat, I ordered the RABBIT HABIT sandwich which has pesto, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, and provolone cheese. It was really good. I drink coffee from time to time but today I had the Italian hot chocolate which is the best hot chocolate I've ever had. My friend had the Nutella white chocolate iced coffee. I had a sip and it was delicious. The staff was friendly and the place was clean.",

Pretty good, but it wasn't until I stopped in for a white mocha that I became truly addicted. I've since apologized to my friends & family, and now only drink a medium one here and there.

We stayed after reading the menu, it LOOKED good. ( who doesn't like to look at a nice chalkboard menu, with pretty font....???) We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited just for microwaved food. Who puts lettuce in a microwave ? Funny thing ! The staff even fought over who was going to make our tiny sandwiches- that (let's be real) should have only taken 5 seconds anyways (because they were being NUKED, ending up inedible). A small mocha frap was 5 dollars, ha....ha....ha.... it was mediocre at best.  We sat squished in the corner by the window surrounded by an uncomfortable silence, almost afraid to make any sudden movements that might have caught the attention of the zombified students who filled the entire place (which is saying a lot being that I'm a college student myself). Does anyone eat here or do you just sip your overpriced drinks while you pretend to study?  Sometimes we can even overlook average food for a good environment but, we ran out of there ....To this day we like to keep at least a 5 mile radius of distance between us, needless to say, we don't plan on going back.",

One night I ordered a 16 oz. latte but upon receiving it, the cup felt quite light. Opened up the lid only to find out that they filled my cup up barely halfway. I could not believe I was charged $4 for barely even 8 oz. of a drink! Also, when I went through the drive thru, I was not once told my total. I expected to view my total on my receipt, but they failed to hand that to me too. They just charged me blindly. Now, I'm not particularly picky when it comes to most things, but with this, I just had to say it.  EDIT: I received a response not to long after my post, and I must say -- it's nice to see owners who take time to respond and attempt to solve an issue. I had no idea people actually read through all of these. It's nice to see an owner who cares about their customers as well as business. Although these may have been a couple iffy experiences, I'm still a Madhouse fan!",

Yes, we are addicted to a sandwich at this coffee shop.

Factor in the 24-hour drive-thru, and you have  my perfect \"pretend I'm an in-the-know local\" spot.  I have dreams about this sandwich - it's that good.

I felt that even the popular flavors were not very flavorful..in fact, the taste was a little too subtle for me. Often, my cup is too sweet and sugary to drink and just tastes like regular coffee (sometimes with a hint of chocolate) and a huge sugar rush to keep me going for an hour and a half into the night!   Because they are open 24/7, it is a place that I frequent when I need that pick-me-up and I'm on the go.

Although the indoor area is small, the large windows give a spacious feel.  Patio: three of the eight tables have umbrellas  The food options are unique, good in quality and quantity.

(Caution, if you're afraid of too sweet, get their opinion first.)  Some of these drinks are like whoaaaa $$$, but their ingredients are really quality. No funny review here to write. Just that this place is awesome and reliable.",

    "text": "I definitely enjoy the drinks here, especially if I want a super sweet, blended coffee.  I love their espresso in iced/hot lattes as long as they don't overload with syrup. It's a big PLUS that they are 24/7. Every girl's dream, right?   I do think their prices are pretty steep, but hey you pay the price if you want it..  I actually understand the pricing, and I don't think it is fair to compare their blended coffees to Starbucks because Starbucks uses regular coffee and coffee syrups in their blended \"frappuccinos,\" not espresso. Madhouse actually gives you the real deal for the blended coffees!    I just think they lack consistency. You will come in and order the same drink for 3 days and on the 4th day a different employee makes it differently and it's not what you wanted. You want what you had originally, you know? Maybe that's because they ran out of certain ingredients, but it shouldn't be that hard to keep up with stock if you make it a priority. Besides that minor detail, it's a great ambience with pretty good drinks.",

Well there is a reason Starbucks is in business it's because these places do not help the customer and this would never happen there.  There are 24 hour Starbucks 3 miles away I can go to adios madhouse.

    "text": "ok, I don't like leaving a bad review, because I like a few people who work there, but saw something that I just can't un-see.  I've been there dozens of times over the last year or so, the cold brew is great!  The last several times the service has been, sorry to say rather poor. And the very last time was the reason why I will never step foot in that place again.   First of all it seems that now every time I go in, there is a new person who is in training and the old people no longer work there, high turnover rate? My price for the same cold brew drink I get every visit, fluctuates at times depending on who's working.   Second, some of the last few times I've been in, the music is just so loud while you're trying to order that you have to repeat yourself a few times just so the barista can hear what you're saying.  I mentioned one time that perhaps they should lower the volume since it was 7:30ish in the am and the techno music blasting was a bit much for as early as it was.  I was told that they had no control over the volume and that the owner is the only one who can control it and that he gets mad when they used to adjust the volume.   I don't like having to yell my order at people.  Third and final reason, while I was waiting for my cold brew to be poured, a barista was out in the table area cleaning up.  I saw him sort of stomp at something on the floor out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look at what he was doing. He started cleaning something brown off of the floor.  I didn't think anything of it, I thought it was weird, but I thought he dropped something? Anyhoo, I got my drink and started to walk towards the door.  His back was turned to me so he didn't see me coming up.  This time I saw what he was stomping at.  Cockroaches.  He stomped again, and he got it.  He noticed me, then tried to hide it from me by keeping his foot on it while I walked past him, but it was too late, the damage was done.  So gross.  He had just killed two cockroaches.  I left immediately and promptly discarded my drink.  Its been a couple of weeks and I have not been back.  It was so gross.  My coworkers told me that I should call in, but there is nothing more that I want from that place.  It really started to go down hill over the last several times for me, but the cockroaches was the icing on the cake.  I will NEVER return.",

I was lucky enough to convince the family to drive off strip before we caught our plane home, brother had a hot chocolate that he loved and mom had some banana coffee that she was impressed with also. So many neat flavors and then lots of choice pastries that are made in house... If I lived there... I'd have to make a habit out of this place. Even it's small scale and colorfully funky decor had me smitten, I was even wowed that they didn't have a register, but used an iPad and credit card square to take payment. Awesome!  All in all, come to the east coast please, mostly northern va, because when it comes to choices for coffee there are only two and they aren't hip, young, nor have that hangout quality.",

Hi, my name is Cynthia and I'm a HUGE COFFEE ADDICT! O_O I love coffee!!! Esp iced coffee. When I'm having my gloomy and \"blah\" days...once delicious iced coffee touches the tip of my tongue, I'm as happy as a fat kid holding a two-scooped ice cream cone.  Not only does this place have plenty of drinks to offer, they have what it seems an endless amount of flavoring to add to your drinks too. You got your usual caramel, vanilla, hazlenut, chocolate, sugar free...etc. AND THEN...you got your passion fruit, your coconut, peppermint and other syrup that slipped my mind because the word COCONUT instantly won me over.  So what did i end up getting? An iced coconut latte. Now, not only is this different...it is a good, different, delicious drink!!!! Ahhh....love at first taste!! My boyfriend got some triple chocolate blended mocha drink in a large size. Probably equivalent to a venti at starbucks.  Only negative thing about MadHouse is that it IS on the pricey side. Both our drinks came out to be $11!!!!! Granted he got a large drink and mine was a small but damn....Unless you got money to throw around, this is definitely an indulgence special treat.  I'll still probably stick to my True love, Starbucks since there's more locations around where I live plus I got a never ending supply of giftcards to use....haha =)  However....if it's ever 12midnight and I got a super bad craving for a coffee drink...I won't hesitate to drive my ass to MadHouse and get myself some yummy-goodness!",

Loved that type of attitude, just brightened up our day! We ordered a cappuccino and a few pastries - the nutella-misu (isn't that brilliant!?) as well as the brightly colored, oversized coconut and strawberry macarons. We sat down in some leather chairs - was pleased that there were plenty of places to sit.   Of all the things, the coffee was to die-for. Strong, earthy, delicious. I absolutely loved it.   However, the pastries were not my favorite. As someone who regularly makes tiramisu and has made macarons numerous times, the Nutella-misu cream was delicious but the cake was dry, and that totally ruined it for me. The french macarons were artificial tasting and there were huge air bubbles - the crust needs to not shatter when you try to bite into them. We threw them away.   I highly recommend the coffee, and the service was awesome - just maybe they should re-work the pastries I described.",

They have raised their prices a bit, but it's understandable given the amount of foot traffic and 24 hr service. Everyone is always so friendly and the drink are consistent.   Iced white, the threesome or more cowbell sandwiches, and fresh desserts make this place great!",

Play a variety of laid back music and have out door seating, though the smoking outside could go but you can't control everyone. Amazing variety of sandwiches with alternative varieties for diet restrictions.....just have to ask and they'll try to accommodate you.   Good stuff!",

Both are great drinks. MH is always a fun environment instead of going for drinks my guy and I go out for coffee even late at night. I love that it's open later than most coffee spots. Employees are always on it and we always get our drinks lighting fast! MH is the spot",

My boyfriend and I like to go get coffee together on date night and often have trouble finding places that are open past 8! This place is open 24 hours to sit inside/outside OR go through the drive-thru!  Lots of different coffee kinds that I have yet to try.. But their pour over's are great. :) they also have a good sized menu for food/small dessert bites.  Overall I thought the ambience of the place is awesome and matches with what is served. Good music, good lighting, friendly staff, delicious drinks.. It did not disappoint and we will be back. :)",

The only complaint I have I that I wish there was more space for individual seating (for studying). I wasn't sure on what to get, so I just got a regular Americano & it was alright. I think I'm gonna get something with a little more flavor... Finally, I LOVE how it's open 24hrs :)",

    "text": "The place is probably the worst non-Starbucks coffee shop I've ever been to. And I love non-Starbucks coffee shops.  The seating is horrible. You have this steampunk cafeteria table with these awful seats with no back support to them. So you literally have to just drink your coffee and leave quickly before you have to see a chiropractor. The sad thing is that everything there is just stupid good too. But I saw one of the employees microwaving the meat in plastic when making the sandwich and I have a huge problem with that when a good bing or google search will show you that burnt plastic causes cancer. The chicken also tastes like a wet sponge.  The inside of it looks like a watered down Starbucks. If your idea of a Starbucks alternative is to just make your shop look like a dollar store bootleg of Starbucks then just don't. Also, what is up with that cafeteria table? And the music is flat out horrid as well. Sounds exactly like the music played at Starbucks. How many times I gotta hear that stupid Take Me To Church song in one day? We get it, your child is more likely to get molested at church than anywhere else on the planet. You don't have to tell me, I'm a devout atheist. I personally find it quite pathetic that they can't even get the order right half the time or even remember that I order anything at all. Then they do that upcharge crap. If you're not careful you can end up spending 30 dollars+ on a meal for two. And I can go to a nice restaurant or grill steaks at home for that price. So spending that much on a sandwich I could make at home and a cup of ice with a shot of tea? Never again  I also notice that quite a few of the patrons are very sketchy. Although with these prices, you would have to sell coke and have a good hustle to afford this stuff. I came in expecting hipster millennials, got a handful of European immigrants staring at me like I came to the wrong neighborhood. They seemed sketchy because they were wearing windsuits with leather sandals. There was also a guy driving around the parking lot offering to repaint my car. He then asked if I knew where I could get some \"black\". I had to google what he meant by that. Then there was that one guy with 4 flip phones. Gee, I wonder what he does for a living.",

It's so great because the atmosphere conjoins with the happiness of seeing my old buddies that it just enhances the overall experience tenfold! Jesse has to be my favorite barista. He's so charismatic and so good at recommending drinks. All I have to do is come in, say make me something good, and he takes care of the rest and makes it amazing. The owner Marco is great as well, I was just standing by the register and he included me in deciding whether or not to bring a new food item in! The workers make you feel at home and the ambience is just fantastic. Foods great, drinks are tantalizing, and this place makes my late nights worth going through the troubles of the day. Thank you guys so much for everything you do.",
