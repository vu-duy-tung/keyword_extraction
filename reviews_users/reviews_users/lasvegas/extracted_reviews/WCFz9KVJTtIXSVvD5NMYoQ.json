    "text": "Went to the Chart House with the wifey a bit back to celebrate our 3rd year Anniversary!  Anyone who can be married to me for that long deserves a nice hunk of beef (her 2nd...if I'm considered her 1st...heh heh heh)!  Located in the Golden Nugget near the hotel registration.  Looks pretty unassuming on the outside because the restaurant is rather open-spaced and housed with a LARGE salt water fish tank, no real sign, only way to tell for sure is the menu stand posted near the steps!  Walk up the steps to find the host/hostess, you will notice that the front of the restaurant is all bar and lounge type seating.  The real restaurant is around the fish tank to the back.  Chart House, there you are!  For our Anniversary we were given a more intimate table for two in the corner directly facing the fish tank.  What a view!  Our reservation also came with personalized menus for the two of us, celebrating our Anniversary on top!  Nice touch.    Our server was excellent, super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable on the Chart House menu!  She even knew we were celebrating our Anniversary!  After ordering some drinks and perusing the menu, our server led us to some great recommendations for dinner.  For a light appetizer we ordered the Hummus Trio - classic combination of traditional, roasted red pepper, and edamame (yes, edamame!) hummus all served with grilled pita and plantain chips.  Delightful!  Thankfully the hummus seemed to be fresh made (hopefully in-house) and was ripe with Mediterranean flavor.  Good quality olive oil, fresh beans.  The surprise was the edamame hummus, it was delicious.  Fresh, refreshing, light, it went great with the plantain chips.  I could eat a huge bowl of the stuff by myself.  I highly recommend.  For dinner the wifey and I went with what else?  Meat!  Chart House Prime Rib 10 oz. cut to be exact.  I asked our server if I should go with a bigger cut because you know, I'm a bigger dude, but she suggested that with the smaller cut the meat would be slightly more tender.  She was correct!  The 10 oz. cut of prime rib was no slouch, it was really a good size portion.  But the flavor was WOW!  Succulent, tender, salty, peppery, overall yummy piece of meat.  The extra au jus on the side was a nice addition as well.  I always (yes always) ask to my better judgment if there is a house steak sauce.  Yes, in a good steakhouse, this is sacrilege!  Our server, being gracious said they don't have a house steak sauce, but A1 if it's necessary.  But she did say to please trust them when they say the prime rib doesn't need any sauce.  Thankfully she was right.  Prime rib was juicy, oozing with fatty flavor!   Cooked perfectly for my liking.  A touch of horseradish, a smatter of au jus, and I was set.  Yummville, population - ME!  Our prime rib also came with a serving of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes.  Buttery goodness!  Creamy!  Did I mention the extensive use of butter?  For an additional side we got the Asian Green Beans.  They were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have created at home.  Fresh green beans, stir fried with soy sauce, sugar, possibly some rice wine or mirin, topped with sesame seeds.   Can't go to a fancy place like the Chart House and not try a dessert!  OK, if you're a diabetic I guess you can.  Wifey and I topped off the evening with their signature Hot Chocolate Lava Cake - chocolate cake with a molten center consisting of Godiva liquer.  Then it's topped with chocolate sauce, Heath bar, and vanilla ice cream.  Whoa!  Talk about punch to your gut!  Luckily I saved some room by getting the smaller prime rib cut.  This dessert was rich, rich, rich!  Chocolate everywhere.  Cake was warm, and the molten center was divine.  Heath bar added some great texture, and the the vanilla ice cream helped to cut through everything.  Piggy us, we finished it up!  Lovely evening celebrating our Anniversary, after dinner we lounged in our booth and took in the fish tank sights.  Just relaxed and relished the rest of our night.  We must have been there an extra 30 minutes, and our server was more than polite and told us not to rush at all.  Rather enjoyed that.  Chart House, overall no complaints.  Wait...bring in a house steak sauce!  Nah, just kidding.  Keep up the food and service, and I'll be back.  Save me some prime rib.",

Even the sides of green beans and the delicious mushrooms were amazing. But the capper was the Chocolate Lava cake! Definitely order the Peanut Butter ice cream to go with it. So worth it! Wonderful service as we had a lot to discuss and weren't rushed through the meal. Loved the Pinot Grigio our waiter recommended to go with the fish. Speaking of which, the fish in the tank were very entertaining to watch. Will definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.",

I had the fish tacos and my husband had the Ahi tuna nachos with an order of the plantain chips for us both.  Everything was delicious, including our drinks from the happy hour menu.    Even though the bar was full, they allowed us to sit at one of the booths on the side of the dining room and order from the happy hour menu.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant even though we were only only ordering the appetizers on special and couple of drinks each.  I really enjoyed both the atmosphere and food and will most certainly return for a full dinner in the near future.",

His recommended menu items were all perfect from the  Ssamjang Shrimp appetizer through our entrees: Mac Nut Mahi for me and Cuban Spiced Scallops & Shrimp for Patrick. The Chart House Souffle we had for dessert was a first for us and was also excellent.   The dining room atmosphere was a welcome grotto of calm in the craziness that is a LV Casino floor which went unseen and unheard just around the corner.  This was the second time we've eaten at the Chart House and I can't say enough about the amazing service Harris provided. He even went above and beyond in consulting with his coworkers to provide us with recommendations for the best night clubs to visit on our final evening in town.  Note: I'm marking the Ambience as \"Upscale\" and \"Classy\" but as with just about anywhere in Las Vegas, customers can dress casually without feeling out of place.",

The restaurant is located inside the Golden Nugget,  and has a beautiful, large aquarium display. Everytime we have been there we have gotten in without reservations, but they highly recommend them. The food is pretty awesome! For appetizer we usually get the crab, avocado, mango stack. I mean, how can you go wrong with that combo. It's light and refreshing and gets ur tastebuds ready for the next course. They give a complimentary bread basket, they are all delicious! Sometimes, depending on the waiter they will ask you if you'd like more. For salad ive gotten both the chopped and roasted beet salad. The roasted beet salad is the way to go. The dressing and candied walnuts are a-ma-zing! Don't think there is anything healthy about it, haha. My go to entree is the 9 pz filet mignon, what can I say your girl is a carnivore, always get it medium rare and it comes out cooked to perfection. I also add the mushroom truffle butter, because why not? The yukon mashed potatoes are sooo freaking good. My bf gets the wok-fried fish and he says its pretty good. For dessert we've had their famous lava cake, but it's not something to write home to your mother about :).",

It was our last day in Vegas and before we hit the road we stopped at Fremont DTLV, we wondered around a bit, and walked in a casino to use the restroom, at the same time  we were deciding on what to eat. We walked around the casino and the first thing I saw was this beautiful aquarium, one glance at the menu and we were sold, although the aquarium alone made you want to eat there .. The host was very nice, and our waiter was even nicer, I wish I could remember his name! Anyway I ordered the coconut shrimp and it came with 3 dipping sauces and every last one of the sauces were exceptional!! My friends were very pleased with their food choices as well. Now it's a absolute must to eat here whenever we are in Vegas .. Not to mention everything was reasonably priced!!! #Win !",

We made reservations, so there was no wait and we were seated quickly.   We were seated at a very comfortable table near a television, which was important as the LA Clippers were playing. The restaurant is simply gorgeous, with a massive aquarium in the center of the restaurant, and everyone gets a great view of the marine life.   Our party of 5 ordered several different appetizers to share: Crispy Coconut Shrimp, Cold Shrimp and Lobster Egg Rolls, and Fish Tacos, all of which were excellent. The group went through quite a bit of wine and liquor, and although I don't typically drink, I certainly enjoyed the Fleur de Lis on the cocktail menu!  I had the Chilean Sea Bass, a first for me, and it was delectable. Tender, flaky and the port wine sauce was stellar. Everyone in the group was very pleased with the quality and taste of the food.   If there was ONE negative thing to say about the Chart House, it was the Souffle. Very, very boring and unimpressive. Tasted like egg whites, and that's it. But aside from that, we had nothing else to complain about!  We had never been to the Chart House before, but I can assure you it will NOT be our last visit. Well worth every penny!",

It's deep fried and as Harris put it \"kind of put together like a rubics cube\". It's a square! If you have room for dessert, spend the extra $1 and get the house-made strawberry ice cream with your lava cake. It's fantastic. My husband got the swordfish and I'm not a huge fan of seafood but I tried a bite and it was also pretty good! If you're worried...just know that there is not a dress code here. We went in shorts and tank tops. Ask for a seat by the fish tank! The fish are beautiful! For $300 you can pick one and they'll cook it for you! Just kidding....you can't do that.

This was THE most dry and chewy lobster I have EVER had! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend had ordered the crab, and while it was ok, it was cold when we got it.   The service wasn't the best but its wasn't the worst. (I have to say though for a meal that ended up costing us $200 plus dollars I feel we should've had a little better service.) I was pretty upset cause it ended our night on a bad note and I felt terrible for wasting money on a meal like this! Even the vegetables that came on the side were overcooked and mushy with no flavor. So bad that even my boyfriend said that the hot dogs at the (Viva Las Vegas) show were WAY better than his crab legs!   The only nice thing I have to say about this place is that the aquarium was pretty cool.   They also don't have their own restroom. Its a little ways down in the casino so just a heads up on that as well.",

They did not rush us like most places do when it's closing time. Appetizers were fantastic the \"crab cake\" to die for; try it, you'll love it! Very accommodating to my tired daughter who reminded me that she only had one meal all day. LOL  Great food, AMAZING staff, definitely eating here again.",

The food takes a little while to come out of the kitchen,  but they are using fresh ingredients and cooking everything to order. I wouldn't expect a quick lunch or dinner here, this is more for leisure than for dining and dashing.   The food was cooked to perfection. You can rely on having a romantic date or relaxed business meal here.  If you want to check out the place, but you don't want to spend your baby's Gerber life plan money away,  just pop in at lunch time or during happy hour.",

I like pesto, but I should be able to taste the seafood first and foremost. The server didn't really leave us alone. I would suggest just going for a cocktail and checking out the sea-life.",

    "text": "Huge aquarium, great drinks, excellent service and fantastic food - does it get any better?  We arrived at the Golden Nugget late Saturday night and were looking for a decent place to eat. We had no idea what the Chart House was all about when we sat down, but we quickly noticed how everything was top-notch. As I was unfolding my white napkin to place on my lap, the hostess stopped me and handed me a black napkin - so the napkin wouldn't leave white lint on my black dress. How attentive and thoughtful!  Drinks: ultimate margarita and strawberry daiquiri - Both were excellent.  Appetizer: hummus sampler - Regular, red pepper and edamame hummus served with bread pieces and plantain chips. I really loved the green taste of the edamame. This was probably enough for three people.  Entree: filet mignon - This comes with mashed potatoes, though they're not mentioned on the menu. I also ordered a loaded baked potato. Everything was excellent, especially the filet which was exactly medium well as requested.  Dessert: chocolate lava cake - This is out of this world. It takes 30 minutes to create after ordering, so order before you're done with your meal. The cake comes with ice cream, hot fudge and Heath bar pieces. Ah-mazing!  This would be a great place for a romantic dinner, but it was also perfect for the large wedding party sitting behind us.",

    "text": "We were staying in the Golden Nugget and one of the first things you see is this amazing restaurant with its huge floor-to-ceiling fish tank. We started with the oysters on the half shell- Fanny Bay oysters just bursting with briny juice and went on to the seafood tower for two. Those oysters are to date the best my husband and I have ever eaten and they were huge. The seafood tower tasted fresh-caught and included more oysters, shrimp, a split lobster tail and split king crab legs. For our entree, we got the grilled swordfish topped with crab, asparagus and bearnaise. He loved it, I was less crazy about it because it came on top of some kind of spicy sauce that was not on the menu. We could not stop dreaming of those oysters, so we actually went back the next evening for dinner and sadly, they were out of them. We ordered the seafood tower and the waitress told us they only had saved enough for the towers! Score! I probably could have eaten a bucket of those, they were so delicious .My husband got an order of kimchi calamari and I could not stop eating it. We also had the coconut shrimp which come butterflied in an edible rice paper \"clamshell\" and they were delicious too. The sauces were especially good. The hot chocolate lava cake comes with vanilla heathbar toffee ice cream and is too big for one person- split it!  It is a lovely room with the aquarium-quality fish tank dominating the decor. The service was excellent. I am in a wheelchair and every accommodation was made for me. They did not try to give me a less desirable table or shunt me off into a corner like other restaurants have done. This is the first place we are eating at when we go back to Las Vegas!",

Maybe that is what threw me off but I remember having very negative memories of Chart House. Fast forward 2 years later and my husband and I decide to do Fremont Street for our Saturday night and we thought we would give CH another try. They seated us at a table for 2 that was directly against the beautiful aquarium. Everything from the moment we walked in was perfect!! Our server was truly a Pro and hit every note just right. I dont drink so I just ordered a Coke. My husband ordered a glass of wine and a beer. We started out with the Beet Salad. I am a sucker for a good Beet Salad and it was Spectacular!! I had the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband had the Prime Rib. I dont eat meat but his meal looked....well, Prime. My Sea Bass was perfectly cooked! Like Butter... The gorgonzola risotto was delish and the fish was garnished with a red wine reduction and cranberry relish. The red wine reduction complimented the fish so well that it was amazing! Everything was so perfect and our server was such an angel. We are definitely going to bring the entire family back here in summer...",

I've been to a lot of Chart House restaurants before, so when I saw this one at the Golden Nugget, I thought, heck, why not...And oooo let's sit at the bar cuz the fish tank is so freaking cool!  We ordered: Calamari, app: fantastic. Crisp, delicious and this sweet chili dipping sauce was absolutely amazing. Little fried pieces of jalapeno and bell peppers complimented it perfectly.  Fried asparagus, app: delicious. It had this hollandaise with it that was awesome with it....whole fried but still tender spears of asparagus. Yummy!  Menage soups: sampler of three soups. OMB (b for Buddha...I'm buddhist!)! definitely the highlight of the meal! Trio of lobster bisque, clam chowder and gazpacho. Bisque was rich and savory yet light....like a souffle almost. The clam chowder had huge fresh chunks of clam and potatoes. And the gazpacho....wow. Fresh fresh fresh, delicious! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!  Spinach salad: beautiful presentation. But bland. Nothing special.  Seared scallops: overcooked, bland and unimpressive.  Filet mignon with blue cheese: delicious tender meat, topped with melted blue cheese and an oniony demiglaze ....absolutely delicious. But we ordered medium and got medium well.   Bartender, Caroline, was very attentive even though she was super busy.   She even made a drink we wanted and was on it step by step! Some bartenders won't even make this drink...super chavelas!  The wait staff that aided her were lax, lazy, slow and had an air of rudeness to the bartender. I didn't appreciate that at all. Spoke to the manager, Michael, to that regard and he was an even bigger douche than the servers!  Great apps, soups and steaks....awesome bartender, breathtaking view of a huge fish tank...everything else was mediocre at best.  Would I come here again? Yes....too bad the wait staff and manager suck.",

Unfortunately, that was not the case on this visit  I started with the soup sampler and while the clam chowder was good, the gazpacho and lobster bisque were underwhelming. After waiting around 40 minutes for the pan seared scallops entree, I questioned the bartender and he admitted he forgot to tell the kitchen. It appeared 10 minutes later and seemed fresh, but the scallops were slightly undercooked and not browned enough for me.   Overall, a decent dish for the price paid, but not memorable. Possibly the fresh fish options are better than some dishes from the standard menu  I'll come back to try again soon, and also to enjoy the fantastic view of that fish tank",

    "text": "The Chart House - Las Vegas  The 5 of us hadn't been together since the Costa Rica trip in 13.  Moonshine had a hankering for golf, cigars, gambling and hookers and he wanted his friends with him. With Moonshine, myself, Montana (he's Cuban...you'll figure it out eventually), Jericho and Sissy (named as such because of the larger then normal sissy bars he puts on all his motorcycles) in tow we all loaded up in Nova's van and headed west. Now I know what your thinking, Preach, why not fly?  Flights to Vegas are dirt cheap.  I hear ya but every since the NDE Montana experienced in the prop plane when flying into Key West he refuses to fly, thus the road trip.  Pussy.   Moonshine set us up at the Golden Nugget because according to him the \"payouts\" in downtown Vegas hotels were far more generous then those on the strip, as are the ladies. Personally I'd prefer the El Cortez but this was Moonshines trip.   We arrived after 10pm, already behind schedule and pissed off because of the frequent stops as a result of way to alcohol consumed and Sissy's abnormally small bladder. Now before you launch into the evils of drinking and driving, all of the driving was done by Jericho and myself as we both drew the short straws. No laws of any consequence were broken during this road trip. At least while the vehicle was in motion. Fine, I lied. I may have had a Stroh's or two.   After a stop at the Commonwealth and thanks to Jericho, time in the \"secret\" bar it was back to the Nugget and a visit to the Chart House.    I never knew this place existed, probably because my normal diet when in Vegas consists mainly of  wings and Bloody Mary's from the Parlour, plus prices to eat at a place like the Chart House leaves me with a lot less for roulette and professional women. Chill, Nova's fine with sharing. As a professional woman herself she gets it.   Dinner consist of coconut shrimp (this ain't Margaritaville for piss sake), lobster & shrimp spring rolls, stone crab claws and calamari for appetizers. The calamari was useless, tasteless and basically nothing more then breading and paled in comparison to the other appetizers. The stone crab was meaty and damn delicious. My dinner consisted of Lobster Bisque which could best be described as creamy liquid sin and Bronzed Swordfish. My fish was perfectly cooked and it came with a side of fried rice which I'm sure came from the closest Chinese buffet...yeah it was that exciting.  The actual highlight of my meal, and loved by all of us was the side of creamed spinach I ordered. God damn delicious. Throw in drinks and I lost count of the number of bottles of wine we killed and our bill exceeded 1K. Shine didn't bat an eye when presented with the bill...rich bastard.   The Chart House is not my kind of place. Although the food was good and in some cases very good, in my mind it's the kind of place you take someone when you are trying to impress someone which I could give a shit about.  However, just because it's not for me doesn't mean shit and I've got to give it high marks  based upon the servers who were outstanding and very attentive, the food which was superb based upon the oohs and aahs of those with me, the atmosphere which is cool as fuck and the fact that it personally cost me nothing. Thanks Shine.   4 stars",

    "text": "I visited on a Tuesday evening for a 6:45 PM reservation with a party of 10 = 1 toddler + 9 adults of which 5 of them act like toddlers sometimes. =)  I was excited to visit because of other friend's previous visits and the Yelp reviews.  Service: 4.5/5 Our waitress was fantastic from beginning to end.  She kept checking on us as the food kept coming for our party and handle our party of 10 easily.  She explained how we can surf and turf our dinner even though it wasn't listed on the menu as an option.  We were celebrating a birthday that evening and they personalized our menus with a Birthday greeting for the celebrant.  Great personal touch we loved  Food: 2/5 The brown bread in the bread basket is excellent, very tasty with butter.  The Iced Seafood Tower was very good.  All the items were fresh and I loved the Tuna Poke. That was my first time seeing poke in a seafood tower, good stuff.  The lobster bisque was disappointing.  Very thin and not very tasty but the pieces of lobster in the bisque was plentiful but couldn't save the bisque overall. My friends were clowning me for ordering a filet at restaurant known for their seafood but I had seafood the other day and figured it'd be fine. I ordered the 9 oz Filet Mignon (medium rare) topped with the Mushroom Truffle Butter and I was unfortunately disappointed.  The filet was bland and the truffle topping was too buttery.   I split the Fried Mac & Cheese and while visually pleasing, the cheese utilized tasted something similar you could buy at a grocery store off the shelf.  My friend who shared this side with me agreed. The key lime pie was a very big slice and was very good.  Highly recommended.  I ended the night with a Baileys Coffee drink that wasn't tasty due to the quality of the coffee.  On a positive note, my friends who ordered the fish dishes were pleased.  I had another friend who ordered the prime rib medium rare and he mentioned it was tasty and cooked perfectly.    Value: 2/5  Overall for me, it seemed like the ingredients used for the dishes were not of the quality I would expect from the prices charged for the dishes.  However, the presentation of the plates was visually pleasing in design and presentation.  Ambiance: 4.5/5 There's an amazing aquarium at the entrance with so many different types of cool fish to see.  The tables, seats and silverware were high quality and the table and booths were spaced perfectly.    Summary: As a Vegas local, there are so many great food options in the city and from my first experience here they seem to be behind the curve in terms of what is offered for price and the quality of food received.  If I happen to visit again I'll most likely check out one of their seafood entrees or the awesome prime rib my friend had.  The staff was fantastic and definitely enhanced the dining experience.",

Service is also stellar, unlike most Strip and Downtown spots that are too tourist unfriendly. Always treated right here at the Chart House.  The big downer is the noise level. It's too clubby to begin with, but the large groups they get tend to really ruin the atmosphere. Be prepared if you are seeking an intimate setting.  The seafood is where it's at on their menu, but everything is just outstanding. The seafood tower and King Crab claws are excellent. Their beet salad is also expertly prepared. If seafood isn't your thing, their meat menu is par for the course compared to other steakhouse. Finally, preorder the chocolate lava cake, it's worth it.",

The rest is whatever.  My parents and wife really like this place but I am just not that convinced. The seats in their lounge area are super small, and the tables they have (not at the booth) are even smaller. We ordered 3 happy hour dishes and couldn't fit them on the table. I had to put my drink on the ground and eat from a small dish over my lap. The booths that we sit in sometimes are very comfortable and can hold enough appetizers for the four of us. But the \"table\" by the bar are meant more to set a few drinks down on and look at the aquarium.   As mentioned above I only really like those apps. I have had the firecracker shrimp and don't think it is spicy enough to warrant \"firecracker\" in the title, and doesn't give off enough kim chee flavor. The prime rib sliders are good, but I am not a fan of the horseradish sauce. Way too much horseradish for my liking. The Humus platter is tasty, but... who goes anywhere just for the humus.   Maybe I should come in and try the regular menu, but the happy hour is worth the price of drinks and a view of the aquarium. I will say that the $7 cocktails are all well made, and the servers are excellent! See you soon Golden Nugget... and maybe Chart House.",

I love that you can watch them and even sit up close to all the action!  The food had some serious misses and this place is pricey. The shrimp cocktail was ok but the high price reflected much larger shrimp. The short ribs weren't as tender as they should be and were accompanied by dry & tasteless mashed potatoes. The lobster grilled cheese sandwich was ok but the lobster bisque it came with was too salty. Overall it was a disappointing meal and the $75 lunch tag didn't make it any better. We also ordered 2 cocktails that were good but I wasn't impressed with the mediocre food. I have no desire to come back and gamble on better tasting dishes however I would come back for the bar and simply order drinks and watch the fish swim by.",

Their know of both wine and food was on par with an establishment that is world class.    Secondly I would like all to know is the food, especially the sea food, is what it is supposed to be.  Simple, the items spoke for themselves and were not masked with too much spices or marinades.   The aquarium is impressive.  It is clean,  healthy looking fish and very active.  One thing that isa bit confusing is that there is a tv playing sports constantly hung on one of its walls.    Lastly I will say the wine list was phenomenal and the staff knew the protocol on how to pitch, serve, and refill.  Staff was well educated and trained,  a rarity in this time and age.    This is being critical but one must know a few things that don't make this a Five Star experience.  I will say the noise level is a bit too high for my liking.  Also,  there are no rest rooms located in the restaurant so one has to circumnavigate the casino floor for refreshing and relief.",

She recommended the shrimp cocktail appetizer, one of the best I've ever had. Our filet mignon was cooked to the right temperature and prepared to our liking. The Ultimate margarita was such a good drink. They even put together a \"HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY, FROM CHART HOUSE\" on the menus. Never had this type of service, and I'm so glad we chose to go here to celebrate. Not to mention, the huge 75,000 gallon fish tank filled with huge fish! Definitely a place you should check out!",

We picked the CH because we figured that out of all the restaurants in Vegas to choose from, it was a guaranteed safe bet that everyone in our family would be satisfied.  The setup this location is very nice.  It has a beautiful aquarium that can be seen throughout and the tables along the wall were more than accommodating for our large group.  We had two of the best waiters (Paul and Edward) you could ask for.  They were very knowlegeble of the menu and knew the details of how the food choices would be prepared.  Also, can't forget their fun factor.  They joked with us and fit in like they were family all while providing excellent service.  Everyone enjoyed their food and experience at this location.  I definitely recommend and will be returing the next time I'm on this side of Vegas.",

The 75,000 gallon aquarium is the center piece of this restaurant and there is not a bad seat in the house for viewing it!  You can even ask the server for a fish identification chart if you are so inclined to learn what types of fish are swimming around in it.    It is absolutely amazing!  The food too is great.  The shrimp cocktail is firm and fresh, served with a great cocktail sauce.  The \"Calamari and Friends\" was delicious!  I highly recommend.  It was lightly fried and very fresh. The \"friends\" included lightly fried veggies -- carrots, peppers, and sweet potatoes.    The Chopped Spinach Salad with warm bacon dressing, chopped egg, bacon, radishes & mushrooms wash beautifully presented and then chopped by our server.  The dressing was just enough and not overwhelming like can often be with this type of salad.  Since I am not a seafood lover, I got the 12 oz. prime rib and it was melt in your mouth!  The baked potato that I ordered as a side was also perfectly done.  My partner had the Stuffed Flounder filled with jumbo lump crab drizzled with lemon butter and served with Yukon golden mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The stuffing was good but the fish lacked some flavor and was rather bland.    The prices are right in line with this type of high end restaurant with main dishes costing between $25 and $40.  Dress is business casual to casual (it is Vegas after all).",

Dinner was awkward. Aside from the weird vibe the food was truly not good. The seasonal salad contained figs that were not ripe and hardly a blue cheese chunk to be found. The salad was heavy on the prosciutto but so heavy it felt greasy. Sadly the salad was still the best part of the dinner. The oysters were pricey ($17 for 6) and definitely not my favorite. I did not finish them (thankfully but I will get to that later). I had my suspicions so I opted for something that seemed difficult to mess up for my entree. Wrong. I had the Mac nut crusted mahi. It was so over cooked it chewed like chicken. The vegetables were tough and the asparagus looked old. Let's just say after spending over $200 on dinner we weren't happy. Icing on the cake was two hours later I began vomiting from food poisoning. Still in bed as I write this review.!",

The ambiance was great, loved the lighting coming from the aquarium. We have a Chart House in Honolulu, but the ambiance is nothing like this.  Our appetizers were good. I really loved our East Meets West, sliced seared ahi and ahi tartare with plantain chips with some sort of slaw. The bruschetta sliders were good, but not super memorable. However, the crab cake in my entree (the Mixed Seafood Platter, I believe...?) was one of the best. Like, actual chunks of crab and lighter on the bread crumbs.   And when your server encourages you to order dessert at the same time as the rest of the meal, you do it. They say that the dessert takes a bit of time to make. Our molten cake (with Heath crumbles!) came out and we. Mopped. It. Up.  Overall, this was a great place and really adds to the Golden Nugget experience. Would definitely go back!",

We were seated in front of the large fish tank. It was beautiful. The atmosphere was bright, lively, and clean. Our two servers were very polite and attentive to our needs.                                               I had ordered chopped salad. It was very good. The lobster bisque soup was average in flavor. All they did was add lobster bits on top of the soup as garnish. That was kind of disappointing and a lazy way of preparing soup. At least put larger chunks of lobster pieces. We both ordered the grilled salmon fish, it was very good. Although the cut portion of the fish was on the small side. Overall our check totaled to $37.00 prior to tipping out. That's with one glass of wine, 2 salads, cup of lobster bisque soup, and 2 grilled salmon entrees. Humm...not bad. Next time I'll try eating at the bar area in front of the fish tank.",

    "text": "My boss assigned me the task to lead our Western Regional Meeting so I took full advantage of this, and instead of booking some generic conference room for the five of us to meet. I walked into the bar at the Chart House and with the help of the super nice bartender, put two two tables together and WA LA! Instant meeting space!   During our three hour \"meeting\" our bartender made frequent trips to our table and made sure to keep us \"hydrated'. There were plenty of dirty Ketel One martini's, Hendricks gimlets and refreshing Caipirinhas being served that helped accomplish this. We were so impressed that we booked a 9:00 table for dinner.   We arrived a little before 9PM and our table was ready. We were seated in full view of one of the most impressive aquariums I have ever seen, full of sharks, moray eels and a bunch of other dangerous looking critters. Our waiter took the time to explain some of his favorite dishes and how they were prepared. But of course we needed to have a few drinks poured first, just to make sure that they were still as good as they were earlier that afternoon.   The menu is seafood heavy as one would expect, but me who only eats normal food was not left out in the cold. There are plenty of land animals included on the menu as well as a nice selection vegetarian options. When it came time to order I went with the prime rib which came with a side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes and a side of creamed spinach. Our waiter asked how I would like it prepared which I responded \"rare\". Since we were dining later in the evening, he was not sure if this would be possible and would check with the kitchen. When my dish arrived I can tell you, it was without question rare and bloody just like I wanted. It was also served with a a side of jus and horseradish. The cut of meat was very tasty and tender and about as good as I have had anywhere. The creamed spinach was a healthy portion and more than enough to share with the six people at our table.   Another pleasant surprise was the wine list that actually included many selections that were moderately priced and several even under $40. Typically at nicer restaurants in LV I struggle to find decent wine for under $60.   It's hard for me to say which I liked more, the restaurant or the bar. The bar here is staffed by some of the most efficient and friendly bartenders in LV who never dare to water down a drink or the restaurant where you are treated to some great food in a comfortable setting.",

My friend wanted to try the Stone Crabs. I'm not a crab person so I can't really comment- we got 5 claws for $50. Presentation was nice, sauces for dipping were good- what went wrong? My salad. I ordered the beet and arugula salad- but I am allergic to peanuts and shrimp. So I made sure to tell the server about my allergy. (Chart House does not keep any peanuts in the restaurant). That is when the manager came over and informed me what i could order that was free from shrimp and what could be a potential reaction. I told him I was ordering the beet salad- he said that was safe.  The beet salad includes prosciutto crisps, blue cheese, mandarin oranges, red onions, caramelized pecans and the dressing. All I asked was for the cheese the onions on the side. I do not know why we were served a salad with only beets on top of spinach! No arugula. No prosciutto, no pecans, no mandarin oranges- idk what happens from my order being \"I would like the roasted beet salad but can the onions and cheese be on the side?\" When she brought the salad out I wanted to ask \"so where is the rest of it?\" I ended up just eating it- which I regret I should have sent it back. Not worth regular prices for beets on spinach.   I will probably not return to this restaurant with so many choices in Las Vegas, there is no room for a repeat.",

The calamari with friends was awesome with fried bell peppers and jalapenos mixid up with the perfectly battered squid. The caesar salad was rfg and my rare-medium rare filet was spot on.",

I also tried their hummus trio and it was pretty tasty. The service was just so, so.   I wish they had more substantial vegetarian choices, eating salad without a good protein only goes so far. I would like to see a pasta or a sandwich on the menu, but for what it is the food was great.  My coworkers ordered different dishes and everyone liked what they had.  I will probably go again because that is the go to place if you are in the area, but not because I am super impressed with the menu.",

    "text": "Located in the Golden Nugget Casino on Fremont Street.  What a cool restaurant!  It has a huge fish tank in the middle of it!    Obviously, they specialize in seafood but also serve up some good land lovers food.  An assortment of breads were served immediately after we were seated (no reservations needed on the Thursday night we dined there).  Shortly, afterwards we were presented our bottle of wine.  Everything is al a carte at Chart House, so be careful not to over-order like us!  We start off our hunger excursion with two salads.  My fiance ordered a caesar* which was average tasting, and I devoured a spinach salad* (YUMMO)!  The salads were both quite large, so you may want to split some of your dishes up.    And because my fiance's eyes are larger than his stomach, he ordered a bowl of clam chowder*.  This too was quite large.  He said it was one of the best clam chowders he's ever had!  (*Pictures of items)  As most of you Yelpers know, I am a steak lover!  More to the point, a filet mignon lover.  Chart House served a decent filet for a seafood place, though defintely NOT the best I've ever had.  It was large, plump, and cooked near perfectly.  For sides, we ordered the asparagus and fried mac and cheese.  I didn't try the asparagus but did try the fried mac.  It was good but way too big and heavy.  It could've been a meal in itself.  I guess we were hungrier than we thought that night because we had to take a doggy bag home...    Chart House is a beautiful restaurant that is well-kept.  Service was on par and prices were average for a restaurant of this caliber.",

In the lobby of the Golden Nugget but secluded with a great entrance design. We were seated next to the two story aquarium which was great. Our server was profressional and pleasant. My wife had the shrimp linquine and I decided on fish and chips after the server said they were the best in town. Both dishes were superb. The fish and chips could be the best I've ever had anywhere. We were sincerely thanked at our table for coming in by the manager and he also handled a small problem with our Landry's Club card (caused by no internet connection, not anything to do with Chart House) by simply handling it the old fashioned way, pen and paper. A great experience.",

    "text": "Christmas day and my wife and I didn't want to make dinner. Our requirements for eating out: 1) no buffets and 2) it had to have a kid menu. After calling around and finding out that many \"good\" restaurants weren't kid-friendly we ended up making reservations at the Chart House, located in the Golden Nugget.  Walking into the lobby of the  hotel it was easy to spot the restaurant. Just look for the large aquarium behind the registration desk. The entrance to the Chart House is a small set of steps to the right of registration. There really isn't a hostess stand so if there's no one to greet you chances are you'll wander around the lounge trying to figure out where to check in. My first impression of the restaurant was that I thought it was going to be bigger. Sure, the aquarium looks cool, but I pictured something bigger with a much larger dining room surrounding it. The reality is that the room feels cramped and poorly laid out.  As far as the food, many of the seafood dishes were the weakest ones we tried. Isn't seafood supposed to be their specialty?   //Appetizers// - East meets west tuna: a duo of tuna tartare with a wasabi sauce and plantain chips and seared tuna with sliced avocado and cole slaw. It wasn't bad, but the slightly mushy texture made me think it wasn't the freshest fish around. - Menage Soup: three small cups of gazpacho, lobster bisque and clam chowder. All were good with the lobster bisque being the best of the three.  //Entrees// - New wave surf and turf: short ribs with a cabernet demi-glaze and seared scallops in a ginger soy sauce. The short ribs were fork tender and delicious but the three tiny scallops were gritty. - Alaskan king crabs: 1.5 lbs of steamed crab legs. My wife didn't like the taste at all. I didn't think they were that bad, but the quality definitely seemed to be comparable to crab legs at a buffet. - grilled chicken breast and fries. This was my kid's order. He was hoping for chicken tenders but had to settle for this, which turned out to be over cooked and dry. But he enjoyed the fries.  Our server was good. He was a slightly older guy who was friendly, very attentive, and even made all of us feel welcome even though we were the only ones with a kid in the restaurant.  I thought the place was a-ok. My wife, on the other hand, was extremely disappointed and couldn't wait to get out. Although her opinion may have been influenced by the fact that she used to work at a Chart House back east. I always liked the chain. They're not the fanciest places and don't have Michelin quality food, but for a chain you could do a lot worse.",

We had just come from some LVMMA fights at the Hilton and were kind of tipsy... I mean, hungry.  The general consensus: We should have just ordered apps.... not entrees.  Once again we went with the calamari and fried mac and cheese as well as lobster spring rolls that were on their special 40th or 50th anniversary menu (like I said... we were too .... hungry.... to remember the details).  The spring rolls were more like massive egg rolls, but tasty nonetheless. I ordered the amazing beet salad again and was stuffed before entrees came out.  As for the entrees, we ordered 2 Chart House platters, free range chicken and the shrimp scampi. The platters were huge and greasy (lobster tail, coconut shrimp, more calamari, french fries.... all deep fried and chewy).  The chicken was small but I guess it was good enough for my lover (who's watching his weight haha) and the scampi \"tasted like Pasta Roni\".  Our server was a nice enough guy but  I probably won't be coming back here for dinner for at least another year... we'll stick to the 99cent foot longs and fried oreos from Mermaids across the street.

Started with the seafood tower for 2 and what my wife called the best clam chowder she ever had--we're from New England so that's saying something/I had sea bass/she had shrimp trio/side of mushroom risotto. PERFECT, everything was PERFECT.   Had an issue with my second pour of Herradura reposado (think they tried to pull a fast one so returned it and got a Sculpin IPA in a bottle).   Harris was the best--very energetic. Our server was so/so, seemed disinterested.  I'll be back",

Sitting at the granite-bar top gives you a front row seat looking at their gorgeous aquarium while sipping down a well crafted cocktail.  My server was friendly, prompt, and helpful.      All elements of the meal were delicious...try the menage soup that gives you a small tasting of Clam Chowder, Lobster Bisque, and Gespacho.    My main entree was blackened swordfish served Oscar style with a delicious side of spicy fried rice.     And dessert was their famous Chocolate Lava cake.   Not a single imperfection with any of it.      And to top it off the price was sane.   You can easily pay double the price on the strip for an equal quality dinner.      Also, look for discounted gift cards at Costco (its part of the Landry's group).",

    "text": "Chart house is an amazing dining experience.  In short, the staff communicates and works well together from the front of the house to the back of the house, increasing the odds of an excellent customer experience with well set expectations.  As you enter the business, the Chart House's huge aquarium greets its guests.  If you're lucky enough, you'll sit next to the aquarium and ponder when feeding time is for the fish, if the fish are upset about me eating seafood, and where their eel is hiding.  Harris, our server, was nothing short of exceptional.  He was conversational, an expert in the menu, and catered perfectly to our dietary needs. Beyond the food menu, they boast an fantastic cocktail menu and wine selection - and Harris was great at making drink recommendations based on our specific tastes.  When my wife and I eat seafood, the volume typically gets out of hand.  This visit is no exception.  We had the large tower: not so \"shrimpy\" shrimp, British Columbia oysters, lobster tail, king crab, and tuna.  It's all fresh and enough to feed 4, helping my wife and I exceed the menu's expectations only needing 2 people.  The tuna had a soy sauce accompaniment that the kitchen was kind enough to keep separate due to my gluten free dietary restriction.  For our entrees, my wife had the lobster tail and I had the surf and turf, also with a lobster tail.  They brought my steak and her lobster tail out first both cooked perfectly.  To prove how well they communicate, almost every member of their staff was sure to let me know that my lobster tail was on the way.  It's even nicer to know that the kitchen stopped the delivery of the first tail based on quality - a nice touch to know they're looking out for their customers.  For dessert, we had another cocktail.  There wasn't a chance that these two individuals bursting at the seems and lacking a sweet tooth of any kind would plow down dessert, but there's always room for more alcohol.  Beginning to end an amazing experience that I'd be sure to go out of my way to repeat any time in Las Vegas. It's possibly the best dining experience available off Fremont Street.",

From start to finish the meal was spectacular. We all ordered different entrees, and two of us ordered the chopped salad to accompany our entree. Our server was fantastic.

I can't remember our waiters name, but he was absolutely amazing. He was very helpful in going over wine pairings and drink recommendations- I ended up having the fleur de lis, which tasted amazing! Like a tropical vacation. I believe it's one of their most popular beverages. I had the special shrimp pasta. The buttery sauce was perfect, not too heavy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly as well. I almost ate the entire thing (It was 1400 calories and I'm a small person!)  My boyfriend tried their chart house platter which came with a bunch of lobster and shrimp and he said it was amazing as well.  The environment is great for a family and friends dinner or a romantic one, like the one we enjoyed. The fish tank provides a beautiful cast to the lighting. The restaurant was loud but not annoyingly so, it was ambient almost. Like white noise.   Overall, Chart House made my birthday a wonderful one. Their staff, service, and food is impeccable and I hope I get to come back soon.",

Finally, I waved both arms, but she walked past us until my other sister, yelled \"HEY!\". Waitress said she thought we had already cashed out. Hoo Boy! She needs more customer service training. We ordered, but a different person served us. We wondered if it was because we're Asian, that she couldn't serve us. We won't go there again. We were blatantly ignored. We spent $50 on drinks and left a 20% tip with \"Service Sucked\" on the receipt. Hope Chart House trains their wait staff to be more gracious and attentive.",

    "text": "We came in for an impromptu dinner, completely sloppy from house hunting all day long.  Their hostesses and waitresses were nothing but accommodating and polite, and they didn't make us feel bad for our appearance.    We ordered salads (garden salad was just okay, caprese salad very good) and filet/lobster with a side of mushrooms.  I thought the veggies were just okay but the mashed potatoes were great!  Also, the mushrooms were very good.  The steak was just okay but the lobster was delicious, some of the best  I've had recently.  So if you go, I wouldn't recommend surf and turf, just go for the seafood straight up.  We got one of their special heated chocolate desserts--it was just okay, we probably should have passed, seeing as how we were so full and it was mediocre, but we were celebrating!  We got a table right next to the tank and it's really cool, to sit next to and for pictures.  Two thumbs up!",

I was close at getting my last drink, but the rest of my party was denied.  Bartender said Verizon time and we all had Verizon phones, so we looked.  It was 12 min before the hour. I had asked for a drink TWICE already so I got mine, but the others were S.O.L.  We still had more and then closed out the tab and proceeded on to the dining area for $350.00.  Oysters were YUM, bread was good, main meal was just ok.  Atmosphere is amazing with the unicorn fish, especially.  Honestly, I would rather go back to Triple Sevens Brewery at Main Street Station though for more Pumpkin Ale and good sandwiches.  Anyhow....  It's vegas so you are paying high dollar for mediocre food.  It's just what it is.  Enjoy!!!  Didnt get to try a desert, but they looked fab!",

There's a huge fish tank and I saw people sitting around but I always assumed it was a lounge.    I had the raw oysters to start and they were delicious.  The presentation was very pretty and I was a bit skeptical because when dishes look pretty, they don't typically taste too good.  But that wasn't the case here.  I then moved on to my trio of soups which was also very good.  My main course were the scallops and I substituted the starch for fried rice, which came in the shape of a pyramid.    Overall the service was great, the atmosphere was great and the food was delicious.  Now that I know this place exists, I'll be back more often!",

We had a snob in our group of 10 that was perfectly neutralized by our server Ott. He indulged her every complaint and criticism with a smile which saved the night. I was personally embarrassed for our snob's behavior but Ott rolled with the punches. He brought out several glasses of wine for her to taste. He also exchanged a perfectly good salad. The food was good, as expected. The setting is very cool because of a gigantic saltwater fish tank with more than 100 fish.  Thanks Ott!",

In the lobby of the Rush Tower is the gorgeous Chart House restaurant.  We have eaten here every time we've stayed and it has always been excellent!  This trip was our wedding/honeymoon trip and we couldn't let it go by without a visit to this fine establishment.  The ambience is casual but elegant.  The service is impeccable.  We began our meal with the lobster bisque.  This was strongly recommended to us by a staff member of another GN restaurant and I am SO glad we tried it!  It is heaven!  We followed with the spinach salad.  This salad was so beautiful upon presentation that it was almost a shame to have our server toss it and for us to eat it.  However, we did and were not disappointed!  For my entree I enjoyed the mixed seafood grill; grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi and a lump crab cake.  Delicious!  My husband thoroughly enjoyed the seared Mahi topped with lobster and jumbo lump crab. I tried a taste of the Mahi and it was great!  We ended the meal with one of their signature desserts, Hot Lava Chocolate Cake (another highly recommended item) and it was spectacular!  The chocolate \"lava\" inside is extremely rich and decadent and is complimented by the vanilla ice cream.    Thank you, Chart House, for yet another lovely dining experience!",

I would recommend the mango mojito. The server brought out warm bread with butter and that was delicious. For appetizers, we ordered the chilled lobster and shrimp spring rolls. It was quite disappointing for the price because I've had much better spring rolls at Asian restaurants. This one was cold and somewhat bland. The lobster bisque was creamy and delicious. Finish it while its hot or it won't be as enjoyable. For the main course, I got the Mac Nut Mahi because it was a high recommendation. I wasn't very impressed by the dish because the flavor combination was not my preference. The purple yams had a strange taste and were too sweet and steered away from its natural flavors. The fish didn't seem to go well with the peanut sauce. However, my boyfriend enjoyed it so it's personal preference. He ordered the filet mignon and it was perfectly cook. You pay for the quality of meat, not the quantity. Overall it was a great experience, but a few misses on the dishes we ordered. The ambiance is a hit.",

We all had experienced the food at many CH restaurants across California.  The several person tall fish tank was the most amazing thing to see right away. We were seated several rows away from it but observed it the entire night. The server was very nice and came back many times more than other waitresses usually do.  The coupon ended up being a bit of a hassle, as no one knew how to deal with something they had never seen. The manager had to get involved, but he visited the corporate website to confirm the details.  After this, everything was fine and we ordered dessert. I remember the dessert was prepared well and everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  I have not once had a bad experience at a Chart House since visiting many over the past 10 years, this one included.",

He started out immediately telling us that nearly everything on the menu would be the best we ever had. He likes to use the phrase \"flavor profile\" and it was his suggestion that the Filet would be the best I'd tasted that caused me to order it.  It wasn't. Not even close. Not only was the stake just ok, it was undercooked (I ordered medium rare, not bloody). In addition, I'd asked for a glass of the Pinot Noir that he suggested to be delivered just prior to my meal so I could enjoy the two together. After another waiter brought our entrees and I was 1/2 way through my mediocre steak, Harris showed up to ask how things were. \"Just ok. And where is my wine?\" That led to his over explaining about the pain of splitting a check at another table... blah blah blah.   I was within 1-2 bites of finishing my steak when Harris appeared again with my wine. \"No thanks, Harris. It's just too late.\"  My SO's chicken was dry and tasteless. If it weren't for the lovely, large aquarium nearby the meal would have been a total bust. Harris would be better served to promise less greatness. I wouldn't have been so disappointed if he hadn't been so certain in his glowing recommendations.   Given this experience and the many other options in Vegas, I'll likely not return.",

Everything was really good. The prime rib was a little salty however still tasted really good. Also some of the green beans were a bit too hard.

It was really really good!   The waiter was very nice. the manager Also came Over to check if everything was going well. Great place.",

Our waitress was a leader in customer service, her name was Lyneet (might be spelled with an extra e or t). She also explained the rewards program and all the benefits it provides people like us who tend to dine out often. The location also provides an amazing happy hour with a variety of options that include wine, beer and specialty drinks (mango mojito is a must try). Cant wait to return!!!",

    "text": "Some people come to enjoy their huge aquarium. We came to escape the Downtown madness...oh, and the food!  I frequented the Chart House on Oahu many times. I had fond memories of their happy hour, great view, and amazing food. I did learn that many of them are now Landry's, including the one here in Vegas. However, upon viewing the menu, I was happy to see it was similar to the Chart House menu I remember.   I was very happy to have included a meal here during my Downtown staycation for Valentine's weekend this year. Here's what our table had to eat, devoured is more like it!  Kim Chee Calamari Spanish Blues Mussels Filet Mignon Lobster Tail Tour de Shrimp Chocolate Lava Cake. Ordered. Got full. Vowed to attempt next visit!  The food was great. Kim Chee Calamari was recommended to us, it's very different than your typical calamari appetizer, but delicious! I would probably pass on the mussels, it was prepared well but nothing spectacular. My boyfriend enjoyed his perfectly cooked filet, but noted that the 4oz lobster tail add-on wasn't worth the price. My favorite shrimp preparation for my Tour de Shrimp entree was with the cedar plank chimichurri. As you can imagine, this was a classic case of \"Your eyes are bigger than your stomachs.\" We had pre-ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake (takes about 30mins), however, we didn't come close to having room for it. Leaving with our doggy-bags, we promised to return for dessert another night!  I'd have to say that Chart House is more casual than I anticipated. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic night, I'm not sure if it's kid-friendly, but definitely a great choice for dinner with friends and family.   Last but not least, we had the pleasure of having one of the best servers ever, Valerie. She was amazing! She made great menu recommendations, timely and efficient, great personality, and at the same time, let us have our evening without hovering the table. We didn't think our entrees took a long time to arrive, but she said it had been delayed in the kitchen. The manager came by to apologize for the wait, and Valerie still checked up on us. As we apologized for cancelling our dessert, she was quick to say it was no problem and effortlessly sold it to her other table. We will definitely request Valerie for our next dinner there!  Chart House, you fed us well. We will be back!",

    "text": "Using the term \"fine dining\" here is a bit of stretch. The service here was lackluster to say the least, but the food was good enough to keep me in high spirits.   I brought my family here for a little Valentine's Day late afternoon lunch. When we showed up, the place was empty. Literally, we were the only people sitting in the restaurant which was a little awkward. We were sat promptly and we immediately were in awe of the enormous fish tank. This floor to ceiling is an aquarium lovers wet dream is amazing, ha! It's placed right in the middle of the restaurant and gives diners a great place to rest their eyes and thoughts during lulls in dinner conversation.  We ordered apps and drinks and so far so good. A bottle of wine for the table and I opted for Moscow Mule. It was ok, a little heavy on the ginger beer and light on the vodka. I prefer it the other way around. The apps were amazing; the Kim Chee Calamari was like crack, I would smoke it if allowed. The Kim Chee added that vinegar flavor that went great with lightly fried calamari. There fried veggies and a amazing sauce that accompanied this dish. I highly recommend ordering this dish, but be ready to share because this plate of food is huge! We also ordered the Coconut Crunchy Shrimp and these were great. A little outshined after the Kim Chee dish, but still very good. The shrimp was still juicy and not over cooked and the coconut breading was light and just a tad sweet. Yummers.   At this point in the meal we were all talking, plates were licked clean, and starting to stack up. Just as the restaurant was just starting to get busy our soup and salads were arriving, so you'd think the server would remove the plates that were stacked up, but nope, they stayed on the table. After salads and soups were finished (BTW - Lobster Bisque was quite delicious) this new set of plates and bowls were now added to already decent pile of tableware. There were five of us, so lets do that math... 5 plates for apps + 2 bowls of soup + 2 large salad plates + 2 bread baskets + 5 bread plates +1 bottle of wine + 3 wine glasses + 2 cocktail glasses, and a partridge in a pear tree. That's about 23 items on a table, half of which were dirty and no longer being used. Now, in a normal fine dining restaurant, these items would be cleared immediately and the table would be re-dressed with silverware and napkins. This did not happen.   The main course showed up and the food runners realized there was absolutely no space for anything on the table. They placed our food off to the side and cleared the table, this took about three minutes. This just shows the amount of stuff that had piled up. Finally, the table is cleared and the food is delivered.   I'll mainly focus on my meal, but I did try a little bit of everyone's and it all was very good. I ordered the Stuffed Flounder: Crab-stuffed with lemon shallot butter and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. This was delicious, the flounder was perfectly cooked. The tender fish was juicy and just flaked apart when cut into with my fork. The crab was a like an amazing edible surprise, that I had forgot about it until it poured out on to the plate. This plate was not only gorgeous, but a giant seafood flavor bomb. The carb lovers side dish was the beautiful golden mashed potatoes. Buttery, creamy goodness!   To close out the meal we tried their dessert specials... Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Chart House Souffle. These were both meh, but I'm not a sweet person. So don't take my word for it.   Wow. I feel like I just had a brain baby with this review. Even though the service was weak, The Chart House's food is stellar and definitely worth the price.    FOODIE NOTE: The food prices here almost triple once the lunch menu is done being served. So, if you're a baller on budget you might want to lunch it up.",

    "text": "We enjoyed a nice Valentine's dinner at Chart House before heading across the tracks to The Smith Center. I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.  We started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).  As for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.  Ever since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a souffle but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Souffle. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Creme Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the souffle.  A note on parking: It seems like you now need to stay at the hotel or dine at one of their restaurants in order to get validated.",

Never heard of edamame hummus, will be looking for it from now on.  The fried mac and cheese, presentation takes it over the top. A hint of bacon flavor, smokey cheese flavor, and the crispy and creamy texture make for deliciousness. Not a fan of bacon, but my sister enjoyed it.",

    "text": "UGH! I'm on the fence about this one folks.  First of all, I ordered a drink while I waited for my room.  Whoa pricey margarita.... But then I found out that my S.O. requested top shelf tequila while I stepped away. So sticker shocked subsided and it was seemingly reasonable.  The restaurant itself is interesting.  You can see a floor to ceiling tank at the bar.  Its huge and bright and its certainly entertaining to watch.   From the lobby, it looks tight and cramped but get passed to the dining area and its quite nice.   Then we come to happy hour.  This is a bit of a sour note for me.  Most happy hours are in the bar lounge area.  We came in and went to a table next to the booth we were just sitting at, and apparently happy hour seating is whatever they decide cause apparently, we weren't sitting at it.  The hostess was quite short with our little group of 3.  We said we will just take our chances and wait for a table to open at the bar.  A nice family signaled for us to take their table.  Great.  Mind you we realized it was pushing on last call for happy hour but we were prepping for a late dinner.  It took them a long time to clear the table. When I asked to pre order my happy hour drinks and food I was brushed off.  I think I might have made the server mad because suddenly another server said she would take care of me.  She was excellent!! Got our food orders in and preordered a few cocktails.  Crisis adverted.  So this happy hour that brought families together, made strangers friends, and tested the limits of patience and compassion?  Pretty neat..... the prices and for what those prices were the food was pretty swell.   $5, $6, $7 ...... get a bunch for the table or get a bunch for you.  Drinks were pretty cheap as well.  And pretty strong.  I'm not sure if I would make it for dinner although I hear it is great.  But if you are staying at the hotel you need to come down early for this happy hour.  Stay for the whole time or prepay your drinks and stay a little later!",

We had lunch of Prime Rib French Dip with delicious caramelized onions as well as an amazing Chicken Franchise topped with mushrooms and artichokes on a bed of angel hair pasta.  It was superb. We ended with the Grand Mariner Souffle which is a purely merengue based souffle which is incredibly light and flavorful topped with a creme, raspberry or chocolate sauce.   Heavenly!!",

I asked if I could sit next to the fish tank she had no problem with that. I like that, accommodating the customer that's what it's all about customer experience. Joanne was my waitress she was very nice and I saw that she was very nice to the other guest she was waiting on. She took the time out to show a young boy the fish around the tank. That's awesome! She really cares about the customer experience. There's another waiter I forgot his name I believe he has blonde hair he was really nice as well he checked on the table. I asked for honey mustard and thousand Island dressing. Joanne brought all the sauces for me and actually made my honey mustard from scratch. Amazing. I had a simple burger because it was an early lunch. The burger tasted really good and so did the fries. I recommend coming here, the food is great and so is the atmosphere. If I owned this restaurant I would be extremely happy with my staff. If I own this casino I'd be very happy this restaurant was apart of my establishment.",

I took my wife to the Chart house because we've enjoyed their restaurant in Dana Point Ca....from the moment we arrived at 5.45 for our 6pm reservation it started off bad and got worse.  The hostess suggested we go to the bar and order some drinks for happy hour pricing and we could take our drinks to our table...my wife ordered a martini and I ordered a Stella...the bar tender said that would be $23.00! We looked at each other like WTF? We asked the bar tenderer why so high for happy hour? She says those drinks aren't on the \"Happy Hour Menu\". Wow...    Then dinner...Don't sit next to fish tank...it's weird. We ordered the lobster bisque, waiter did his best to \"up sell\" us on more expensive specials and dessert...we'll split the large prime rib with asparagus and some bread with the soup.    Soup and bread good,  he brings prime rib out when we're half way through the friggin soup!!! Prime rib was average....we ate half and asked to wrap it up. We sat there for 10 to 15 min with our dirty plates in front of us. Buss boy walks by...nothing...we were not pleased at all with what was amateurish service/food.   Waiter brings bill, we pay him, I ask, \"where's my to go\"? Oh ya...he brings that back...we joke that he's got to retrieve from trash can...he brings my to go so we go to Bellagio for Crepes and to see Christmas Decorations and piano music...which saved my wife's Birthday.  I'll not go back to this Chart House. Sad service, Sad Food and experience for $135.00 meal/drinks.  What's really sad is we're not wealthy people and this night out was a real sacrifice for our Dec. budget. Ah well.",

    "text": "A quaint seafood restaurant located in the Golden Nugget. Upon approach the entry is bit confusing and uninviting. The hostess stand is more just the end peice of the bar, which would make sense because to your left is the lounge seating area and to the right is seating for the actual bar.  As for ambiance and decor, there is a large aquarium in the center of the restaurant which is filled with beautiful fish. Creates an illustrious allure.  At first we were a bit taken back we were brought to a table that was in the middle of the bar/lounge area. We asked to be reseated in the main dinning room. We were really sure why we would be seated in the noisy bar that was filled with groups of people just drinking vs the actual dining room since we were there for dinner. Nonetheless, that was a bit of a upsetting start.  After being sat at our table, someone offered us water but spilled it on the table and never wiped it up. We ended up wiping it up ourselves. We were greeted and welcomed by our server and offered cocktails. We tried the infused dill drink. Presentation was unique and new. The drink itself was good, not too strong and a great pre-dinner drink.   We started with the oysters. First thought, they were huge. Unfortunately, not the tastiest. They weren't amongst the freshest and required extra lemons to be squeezed over them. Next we had the lobster bisque and chopped salad. The bisque was good only thing is it wasn't very warm upon being served, more like room temp so that was a bit disappointing. Chopped salad on the other hand was crazy good!  Side note: they had this brown bread (forgot the name) that was Delicious!!   As we moved onto our entree we ordered a bottle of Paraduxx wine. One of my absolute favorite wines. I ordered the lamb chops with fingerling vegetables and a side of creamed spinach. The lamb chops were prepared medium rare. Probably one of the best lamb chops I have had. The sauce served over it was a little strong however it didn't take away from the meal itself.   I love creamed spinach and always get it when I see it on the menu so I had to have it. They serve it with crushed bread crumbs over it, different.   Food overall was acceptable. It is a pretty average menu restaurant with no real special items or distinct flavors. For the price I feel there are other seafood restaurants  that are much more worth it.   So why 4 stars, simple...our server Julie was amazing! Seriously if it wasn't for her I probably would have given 2 or 3 stars. Julie was all smiles from start to finish. She had quality suggestions, was extremely pleasant and best of all she connected with us throughout our dining experience. We had a couple small 30 second chats here and there which left us forgetting about our unsatisfactory moments.   I love trying new places, living in Las Vegas there are tons of spots to try and I'm always up for new experiences. If we ever come back I'm definitely going to ask for Julie.",

That being said, we did have a few problems with our waitress. Her name was Kim. She was bitter, catty & completely unprofessional. However, the excellent manager, by the name of Mark, apologized on her behalf & made everything perfect for us.  We started off with some drinks. My pomegranate martini was delicious. We also ordered the port of Manhattan, it looked very pretty because of all the cherries. It was very strong because of the bourbon. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail. It is always fresh & it comes with that dry ice affect which looks very interesting. I have ordered other appetizers. The coconut shrimp is also very delicious & crispy. And, I really love their beet salad & lobster bisque.   I wasn't very hungry this time. But, I have never been disappointed with anything that I have ordered as an entree, either for lunch or dinner.   We did have an appetite for their chocolate lava cake. Which looks beautiful, but it tastes even better than it looks! Also, the view of the giant beautiful aquarium is always a treat! Even though, we had a rocky start this time... Thanks to Mark & all the other wonderful people that work there, we ended up having an amazing time!",

SHORTS RIBS ($19): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2i0RwX7&s=9edacef889547df2d250b3a8919b8963dd62d1363bbd550b9ed3bc049e2329ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2i0RwX7</a> This is by far the best braised short ribs I've had to date.  This massive piece of boneless short rib was so juicy and fork tender. The rich velverty cabernet demi-glace was also quite delicious. The garlicky yukon gold mashed potatoes was velvety and smooth that I finished the whole thing (and I'm not a mashed potato fan at all, so that says a lot). Tis dish is a must-order.   SEAFOOD SALAD TRIO ($20): This was my half-ass lazy attempt at trying to be healthy while pigging out in Vegas....it had the word \"salad\" in it, so it counts. Yep...that's a fried tortilla on the side, lol!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2hEyOUc&s=32efdee4e0540a5fcdbfaf7b1828a930edab03695212fdafa638d0f18010f2b2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2hEyOUc</a> - The \"shrimp napoleon\" was basically 2 cocktail-styled jumbo shrimps butterflied and laid criss-cross over each other. Perfectly cooked shrimp, nothing fancy.  - 2 slices of pepper seared tuna - A spoonful of jumbo lump crab meat The rest of the plate consisted of a couple pieces each of tomatoes, hearts of palm, prosciutto crisps and a scoop of avocado-kimchee slaw with ranch dressing.   The bf and I split this deconstructed salad as an appetizer.  It didn't look or sound like a lot of seafood, but it was definitely filling and something I wouldn't mind ordering again.   FISH TACOS (2 tacos for $12.50): Fish of the day was mahi mahi.  The bf fully enjoyed his plate of tacos. The cajun-spiced mahi was juicy and tender. The jack cheese, fresh cabbage, pico de gallo and ranch dressing was the perfect accompaniment to this filling plate of food.   Our server that day was a hella fun guy name Randy. He was so bubbly and friendly, love him! He was so engaging and even offered suggestions of which museums to check out because it was my bf's first time in Vegas.Hopefully we get to see him again the time we visit because we'll definitely be back!",

The entrees and wine suggestions were paired perfectly. I can truly say that it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and we visit Vegas a lot. Give this restaurant a try. You will rave as we did! Some of the appetizers/entrees that I have had elsewhere but the best at this restaurant were: Crab, Avocado, and Mango Stack, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Coconut Crunchy Shrimp, Prime Rib, Fish and Chips, Hot Lava Cake, Warm Bread. I am sure this is not all we loved!",

    "text": "Chart House is a chain in the Landry's family of restaurants, but don't let the fact it's a chain dissuade you from checking it out. In a town of celebrity chefs, and literally thousands of dining options, the Chart House at the Golden Nugget holds its own.  This is not the first visit to the Chart House. I live in close proximity to the one in Marina Del Rey, and my wife and I dine at the Las Vegas location whenever we stay at the Nugget. I can honestly say I do not remember a bad experience at the Las Vegas location, and this weekend was no exception. Both the service and the food were top notch. This particular evening we were in the mood for steak, and did not want to pay Vic and Anthony's inflated prices.  We started with the crab, shrimp, and vegetable fritters, a diversion from our usual lobster bisque. These were great, and the kimchee sauce is a nice twist. Our entrees were the prime rib for myself (Callahan cut, of course) and the filet medallions for my wife. Both were cooked perfectly to our preference, and satisfied our carnivorous cravings. Service was great, and our waitress was friendly and very accommodating.  My only gripe is the beer selection. VERY limited. These days everyone is into these craft brews and etc, to only offer the usual junk seems like a misstep. I wanted some kind of amber, and best I could get was a Sam Adams. While annoying, I didn't deduct any stars for this.   TIP: Sign up for the Landry's Select Club. You'll get a $25 reward once you spend $250 in a year. I believe you also get $25 just for signing up, but I can't remember if it has to be used on a future visit.  Thanks Chart House, for another great and reasonably priced meal. Will repeat!",

Only ordered one entree per person.   Service: really pushy. They force you to have everything and make it rather embarrassing to reject it.   Food: it's mediocre. My mother ordered shrimp entree. It was hard and not juicy. I don't know why/how they overcook shrimp so much. On the other hand, rice was undercooked. Caesar salad was really terrible. It was ultra salty. Lobster was ok, but rather mediocre for $72 entree.   What I found kinda interesting was just fish tank. But you can see fish tank in the swimming pool too, so why bother?  If you want to waste your money because you won in casino, go ahead and eat here.  Otherwise, I recommend to check out Paradise buffet in downtown. It is only $16 per person w drink. There are tons of better deals in buffet in las vegas hotels. Bellagio is good and even Caesars palace buffet costs less than this.   I believe if I pay extra money like more than $50 per person, I expect a better return and quality food, and unfortunately, this restaurant failed my expectation miserably. Never returning here.

The Scallops were well cooked, and the mashed potatoes ensure that you have enough food and won't go home hungry. As an added bonus, the green beans are well seasoned and taste more like a treat than a boring vegetable.  We ordered the oysters for appetizers. The oysters themselves were good, but the shell still had salt water in it. Fresh is good. Salt water is not good. It was a little disappointing and damaged the taste of the oysters. But, again, you can taste the quality.  The service was great, they checked in with us regularly, kept our drinks full, and made sure there was always fresh bread and butter on the table.

The seating was probably the worst part, we were seated in a boot really close to three other couples! We could literally hear the other couples conversations. Now the food, to be frankly honest the only thing we liked and enjoyed of the whole meal was the calamari appetizer! My wife and I both had the Prime Rib and it was really chewy and flavorless.

Our server, Valerie was also brilliant, she was attentive, knowledgeable and also human, which always adds to the experience. I have been there a few times now and every time it has been brilliant. This is now going on my list of Vegas recommendations.",

We ordered and shared the fried calamari and stone crab claws.  Everyone that ate the crab were very pleased, and the fried calamari was cooked perfectly not chewy and the sauce that came with it was delish.  There were a variety of entrees ordered, and served as ordered and everyone was pleased.   Our service was impeccable from start to finish, they were there just enough not overly attentive but our drinks were kept full as well as our belly:) What a great place to celebrate or just enjoy a wonderful dinner.",

    "text": "Decent little place to grab happy hour if you are Downtown. This review is only of the happy hour sitting in the lounge area.  The HH menu is pretty good for a group of people to order off of, although not everything is really shareable. My group just asked the server which would be best to share and she obliged.  Hummus was great - three different styles (traditional, red pepper, and edamame), but I wish there had been more grilled pita. The addition of plantain chips for dipping was very nice!  Spinach & Artichoke Dip - Meh. Not very good, and a small portion (the dish is very shallow!). Plus there were just a lot of fillers on top of the dish, making it hard to get to what you actually want - the spinach and artichoke dip, of course!   Lettuce Wraps - Comes with seared chicken, cucumbers, carrots and a soy sauce glaze. These were OK - but the lettuce was a bit wilted when it came out making these a bit less appetizing than they should have been.   Chart House Sampler - This one is a weird one, and you'd think it would come with more than just a few items considering it is called a \"sampler\", but the portions were kind of meager and the lobster/shrimp spring roll (1) is not good for sharing.   My group also imbibed on numerous drinks (I did not), but they looked delicious and were decently priced.  Bonus - make sure to sit in view of the fish tank and watch the colorful fish swim in the glass tube of emotion. (Ron Burgundy...)",

Came here for my husband's birthday, we were so disappointed with the service an food. The lettuce on my salad was brown and small for $10, we ordered asparagus it was soggy and stringy we also ordered the prime rib which came cooked to death after we had order it to be cooked rare. The manager came over and tried to make things right by giving us a different prime rib. The problem with the prime rib is it has zero flavor and it was sizzler quality. . I told the waitress on a couple times that it was my husband's birthday, she made no effort to even say happy birthday. The martinis were weak and tiny.  I do not recommend this place unless you enjoy sizzler  quality  meat, old salad and tiny martinis that are watered down",

My mother in law, would jokingly point and say, \"i would like this one, and that one!\" Although I am not sure if she meant on her plate, or to take home? We particularly had good service. Altogether the ambiance was fun, but I would not suggest for small children as it is a quieter restaurant in a rather big casino environment.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their appetizers on the table. My MIL had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, which came stunningly on a vapor-like dry-ice display. Very cool. I turned to the Menage soups, which were size proportionate. In this moment I realized I am not fond of tomato based gazpacho, in general, as this a second attempt - but you may like it. However, the lobster bisque was extremely creamy,  and the clam chowder was the same with many small pieces of clam.  My main dish was the mixed seafood grill, which again was proportionate. I was definately rooting for the grilled citrus salmon on the plate- delicious!. The asperagus was perfect as a refesher when moving between the crab cakes, shrimp & Salmon. My husband had the  Spiced Yellowfin Ahi to Chef recommendation (Slightly seared & rare), which was also delish. In fact I would have been greedy and jealous had I not had a good plate myself.  The apple crisp was good, with a slight sweetness. Not what you would want for a sweettooth (i would go for the creme brulee if so), it was perfect to my taste- but once again, not super sweet.  Overall, a thumbs up!",

They tie it with a ribbon and present it to you, before you leave. They also give you a yummy piece of mud pie.  The huge fish tank is awesome, but it apparently dictated the set up of the entry, which is confusing. The entry isn't marked, and you have to guess that you are supposed to wait on the right side, if the hostess has stepped away.   The food was not as good as I expected, for the price. I believe my crab stuffed flounder or sole filet was around $25-30. It was a bit bland. The most disappointing part was that I bit into three large bones, on my very first bite. I've filleted fish, and the chef or whoever stuffed the fish, should have felt those bones.  My boyfriend was happy with his coconut shrimp. I tasted it and thought it was good, but not wonderful.  All in all, it was a relaxing meal in a nice atmosphere, with good service. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't quite enough to make me return. In a city where there are so many fantastic restaurants, there are places I like better.",

    "text": "I hate to write this, but this Chart House location is fair at best.  I frequent a Chart House near my home and love it so I had high expectations for the Las Vegas location. Let's start off with the positive -- I heard that they recently renovated the restaurant and it shows.  There is a large fish tank that is the center of the restaurant -- so pretty.  The restaurant is rather small so you feel cramped in depending on where your table is located.  Janea was our server for the night -- we had some questions on the menu and she had to leave and ask someone else each time.  Doesn't really give you a vibe that she knows what she's doing.  She also didn't come around enough to check if we needed anything like drink refills etc.  One of the appetizers that Chart House is known for is their crab avocado mango stack.  It's an appetizer that I get every time I go to the location near my home because it's so good.  This appetizer in the Las Vegas Charthouse?  Not that great.  One of my friends had the prime rib and it was loaded with fat -- should you expect that for an entree that cost $32.00?  I don't think so.  I had the stuffed shrimp which was nothing to write home about and someone else had the shrimp pasta entree -- they didn't like theirs either.  How could this location be so different?  I don't know but it is.  I do know one thing -- we won't be back to the Las Vegas location.",

Reality: Snobbish employees, sloooow service and poor customer relations!  Party of five, drinks were ordered and came in a reasonable time.  Ordered appetizers and waited and waited and waited, four clam chowders and one lobster bisque took over 30 minutes to serve.  During this time, no one checked on us or let us know what the delay could possibly be.  More waiting for charcuterie & cheese plate and spring rolls, finally the server comes back and says your plates will be out in just a few minutes. We tell her never mind and speak to the manager, she comps the four clam chowders but the damage is done. Not once during this marathon did the server or anyone check to see if we wanted more drinks or to let us know they realized we were still there. I expected and have received much more from other Landry's restaurants. Went over to California Noodle House, welcomed with open arms, excellent service and delicious food.",

    "text": "I really liked the ambiance of the Chart House.  From our comfortable, contemporary booth unusual looking fish swirled about before our eyes in a large and tall tube-type aquarium while we dined.  The place was sleek and modern, beginning with two 6-foot hostesses in black miniskirts, appearing much like human bookends, who confirmed our reservation and gave us a friendly greeting when we arrived.  The aqua floor upon entry looked like water, which added to the sea mystique.  Our first dish was dramatic, with a nice presentation of True meaty jumbo shrimp that were shooting off steam from dry ice.  A complimentary bread basket was small, but it was ample for 2 diners, and contained good brown and white bread, as well as tasty rolls.  New England Clam Chowder was good but unusually crunchy from celery, while Diane dealt with a Lobster Bisque that was rather heavy on the brandy.  Sauteed Mushrooms were juicy, and this side was very large and lasted all the way to dessert, but the sauce on the sizzling skillet was not that tasty.  However, a lovely chopped Spinach Salad with egg, mushrooms, and red onion was.  What I particularly liked about this dish is that the various parts were presented in side by side fields of color: a column of yellow egg placed next to a column of green lettuce, and so forth.  Then it was left up to the diner to toss all ingredients and the fine dressing together as desired, which I found to be fun rather than an annoyance.  I then enjoyed a good pan-fried pink Salmon enhanced by a blanket of crisp prosciutto, while Diane ultimately enjoyed  very tasty Stuffed Flounder.  I know, because I tried it too!  But, the Flounder that was originally brought to the table had to be sent back, because the first batch was too spicy for my spouse's delicate palate.  I appreciated that the request for a less spicy breaded Flounder was cheerfully accommodated, and although it took awhile for a new entree to be cooked, the manager personally brought out the replacement, and it was made just as requested.  We also shared a side of great Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, and I had fine Green Beans presented on my plate.  Our dessert of a Chocolate Souffle that had properly risen was good but not what we expected to receive.  It was real airy--more like a tasty meringue than a sumptuous souffle.  Service was impeccable!  It was attentive, and there was not one service error by our very competent female server.  In fact, the worst thing that occurred happened days after the meal when all photos of the food but one were lost in a failed effort to store them in a backup drive.  Hence, the single photo that appears with this review.  But at least that photo was taken just after a slew of dishes had been placed on the table.  This was the first and only time my photos for a Yelp review were totally lost before they were loaded on the restaurant's site.  May it be the last!",

It started out good with drinks and we ordered appetizers of fried calamari.  We ordered dinner and the waiter took the order for half the table and then said, \"oh sorry we are all out of prime rib\". REALLY?!  this is what the restaurant says it is know for and yet you don't have any!  I think that they should have let us know that when we sat down.  Of the 13 people in the party, 9 people had ordered prime rib.  Then in a weird way, the waiter came out and said they found 3 pieces of prime rib.  Where was the prime rib?!  Hidden?!  I spoke to the manager on duty and he didn't seem to be concerned. He told me, \"sorry.\"  I mentioned that it should have been shared with us prior to sitting down and he said, \"once I heard your table was ordering prime rib I went to the kitchen and found 3 pieces.  The waiter said that it wasn't a big deal, they had other cuts of meat.  It doesn't sit well when we came in for prime rib. We were provided 3 pieces of ice cream pie for our inconvenience.  Hum and bill of over $800 and we are suppose to feel special because we got 3 pieces of ice cream pie.  It was a disappointing experience.",

Both the salmon and the Mahi were pretty bland and not worth what they charged for them. The short ribs were very tender but the sauce it was in just wasn't palatable. I noticed that everyone else that got the short ribs had not taken more than a couple of bites.   The lobster bisque and the calamari & friends to start were the best dishes we had, but it may have just seemed that way because after soup and appetizers the dinner went downhill.  2 stars go to the entrees but since the appetizers were good, this place gets 3 stars.",

    "text": "It is 5 years since my first review of the Chart House. We have been back many times and enjoyed it each and every time. Despite being a chain restaurant in a downtown hotel, this is a restaurant that just does everything right. Unlike most restaurants in Strip hotels, valet parking for the Chart House is convenient and free. Use the rear valet and the Chart House is right inside the doors. They honor their reservations. We have never had to wait more than a couple of minutes. The ambiance is terrific with the giant aquarium in the center. Plus the tables are nicely spaced - no hearing the conversation at the next table. The service is close to perfect. And the food is 5 star. We shared the shrimp cocktail - 5 large shrimp, very fresh and very cold with a tangy cocktail sauce. Yummm. Then we shared the ahi. Seared to perfection, very fresh, cut with a fork, melt in your mouth tender. It is not inexpensive but it is worth it.",

By 5 pm, this area was fully occupied, so be sure to come early like we did if you want your pick of seating. Maggie, our bartender, was a darling. Everything from making suggestions to taking a picture of us in front of the famed aquarium, she executed with a smile. The happy hour prices for this restaurant are unbeatable. Prices for drinks and small bites start at $5. For a mere $36 (including tip), we had 3 drinks and two appetizers!! I highly recommend the Fleur D'lis, which was my drink of choice. It is on the sweeter side, which I loved, and has in it: Malibu coconut rum, Midori melon liqueur, peachtree schnapps, orange and pineapple juices. My boyfriend had two perfect pour Blue Moons. And for our small bites, we enjoyed the lettuce wraps and the spinach and artichoke dip. Both appetizers were fantastic, and enjoyed with such a wonderful view of the aquarium. We will certainly be back on our next trip to Vegas, and a big thank you to Maggie!!",

Great prices on food and drinks, but while the drinks were a steal, the food was a bit disappointing.  My husband had a $3 Miller Lite, and I had two $4 Beefeaters and soda. Healthy pours on that gin! For snacks, we chose the $6 lettuce wraps and $7 firecracker shrimp. Surprisingly, for a place known for its seafood, I much preferred the lettuce wraps, which had a nice combination of chicken and vegetables with a sweet soy glaze. The shrimp were touted as being \"tossed in a spicy kim chee sauce,\" which sounded great, but the sauce was more like the \"spicy\" (not spicy) mayo served on sushi rolls, and the shrimp themselves were flaccid and flavorless.  The fish tank is worth a visit itself, and you really can't beat those HH prices in the downtown tourist corridor. But next time I'll stick with the drinks and maybe an order of lettuce wraps if I'm hungry.",

    "text": "My wife and I came in here on Christmas eve about 930 we were amazed by the awesome attentive service we got from Paul and his crew. This made our night just that much more special. All our food and cocktails and dessert came out in a timely manner and Paul was very personal with us. I would recommend the calamari which is tossed in a kimchee sauce it's why we decided to go out I had been craving it for months now. We also ordered the prime rib and my wife got her seafood dish. We ended the night with the chocolate lava cake which was good, we  also tried their house made peanut butter ice cream which by its self was good too rich for the lava cake though. We will defiantly be back and I would definitely recommend this place for all celebrating occasions.",

    "text": "not great for the money.  So, we were comp'd (the waitress did not know this) so we ordered freely.   The service was quite pleasant but the quality of the food was very average.  Specialty cocktails: bloody may (no flavor?) and a their version of a moscow mule (they ran out of proper glassware with apologies - this version was a fruity sweet drink.   The oysters were good.  The orange / avacado salad was killed with red onion (a seasonal special?) and no other flavor in the dressing. The ceasar salad very good.  brick chicken was a dry flat piece of jerky with no seasoning. Her marinated tomahawk lamb chops (again no salt or pepper) overcooked and flavorless.  Finally, decaf coffee absolutely the worst coffee in LV - they didn't offer to take it off the bill (again they had no idea of our comp)  They are now owned by \"the Billion Buyer\" who is a restaurant magnet. So, the wait staff did push the $25 Landry's Club card. We bought figuring the waitress got points for selling it - she was very pleasant.  When in LV I am sure a trip to the bar at happy hour with fried appetizers would have been better.   Based on the previous reviews I suppose your experience will be hit or miss - we were a miss.",

The combination of food quality, atmosphere and especially service is unbelievable. My girlfriend stated to our server (James ) that she has some food allergies and he immediately started taking notes of everything she said, He then leaned in and said \"we take food allergies very seriously here, i will bring out the chef to ensure that there are no issues\" It felt really nice for someone to finally understand. Food was incredible and we were seated right next to the tank per my request. At the end of my meal, James brought over a card that he personally wrote to wish us a happy anniversary.  I look forward to my return,",

It was ok. I wouldn't really order it again.  Then I got the chips and dip, which were homemade potato chips and green onion dip. This was delicious and I would absolutely order this again. Lastly, we got the pan seared scallops which did not disappoint.  The bartender was super friendly and the atmosphere was cool.  If I'm ever in this casino again, which is not very likely, due to location, I would stop in this place again for their happy hour!",

Portion was big, and we even had leftovers.  The calamari included both rings and tentacles and some veggies, all fried up to a golden color.  Underneath the calamari was loads of white, puffy rice noodles.  That was a pleasant surprise!  Service was great and we even got to share a small slice of their mud pie for our anniversary.

Secondly, when I made the reservation, they asked if we were celebrating anything... I thought it was just a common question, but no! They put \"Happy Birthday, Mercedes!\" on the menu! All 4 of our menu's had that message on the top. What a nice, personal touch. Now the food... oooooooooooh the food. I wished I had 4 stomachs so I could eat it all. The lobster bisque was sooo tasty, so was the gazpacho! For my entree, I had the filet mignon with sizzling mushrooms. Everything was delicious. My mom got the stuffed shrimp and let me try - that was also incredible. And the pomegranate mojito tasted like candy!! I would definitely come back to the Chart House again!",

That being said, they definitely price and shape their dishes and sides to encourage \"3 dollar sign\" or over food bills. I've had expensive filet minion elsewhere and was given good veggie and carb choices included in the meals whereas here you'll have to get your own veggies. My young hen dish, although on the cheaper side, came with meager veggie sides (burn and shriveled) and two sad little potatoes. Then hen was also basically four small, if at least flavorful, roasted leg pieces.  Ok ignoring the overpriced food, they do have a large menu selection and also seem to specialize in cooked seafood dishes. And I must say their service is exceptional as the staff works tirelessly to make sure you are taken care of.  Despite being disappointed with my food quantities, the flavors of the main dish was there and the potato mash and crab cake sides were good. That and the huge souffle option made the meal interesting and deserving of 3 stars. Honestly I would go elsewhere and spend money to get the most out of it.  To be fair, I'll mention that their seafood platter is huge and you definitely get what you pay for.",

    "text": "I don't like to give reviews this bad but when everyone at the table comments on the food wasn't as expected & the service was really bad, I can't justify a 3-star.  The meal did not even start well with the appetizers. They looked good but flavor of hummus plate was fair, others got the ahi tuna & one bite was enough for that. Trying not to be overly critical so didn't complain about it but the rest of the meal didn't get any better. The entrees - mezzo plate rice was flavorful but only slightly warm and grilled veggies were barely warm which was all because of the service, the carrots were hard as if they had only been grilled for a minute- plus no seasoning or sauce for the veggies, only the rice. The prime rib was full of gristle & not tender.  Service was so bad I felt compelled to let the manager know. The guy who was delivering the plates told one of our party who was still eating her salad - \"you need to move your salad because otherwise there's no room to put your plate\". Set down a couple other plates - mine he put down on top of my utensils and pushed the appetizer plate. When someone tried to ask a question \"I'm not your server, don't ask my questions\". That's not even good enough to work at Denny's.  I tried to be fair about the server but even he was in need of improvement. When appetizers were ordered to share at the table, he went around and took an order from each person. There are 2 sizes of hummus plates, never did he ask which size was requested NOR did he mention that there had already been one ordered. He just placed the order for two large plates. We ended up changing to a larger table before the appetizers were served & found out that the person next to me had ordered one. Tried to cancel the second but \"it's already prepared and will be right out\". Glad this was a dinner meeting & not on a time constraint because appetizers weren't served for another 15 minutes or longer.  When the $700 bill came, noticed that we were charged for 6 bottles of water. Granted there were 8 of us, but other than pouring water for each person when first seated, others were drinking cocktails so 2 bottles & maybe a 3rd that I had to continue to refill my glass with. At dessert time we did need another bottle and when that was poured in one person's glass- she couldn't drink it because there was too much floating around. So obviously the server was trying to get as high of a ticket as possible even through dishonesty and yet couldn't even be sure to use a clean glass. Some of us do not like to be taken advantage of and so brought up the discrepancy to the manager. Her reply of \"I'll check with him\" followed by \"he said you did use 6 bottles but I'll take 2 off\". Better would have been to simply say \"I'll take 2 of the bottles off\". I know how to count so either it was an insult or an accusation that we were just trying to get something free. We just didn't want to be charged for items not received. We didn't question any of the charges for foods that we ordered & tried but didn't care for.   Maybe this was a bad night but I have no reason to try again. Food- 3 stars.    Service - 1 star",

Luckily we scored a lovely table right next to the amazing fish tank.  Started off with a Fiery Cucumber Martini and a Crowned cocktail, both were delish. My martini was rimmed with a spicy cayenne pepper seasoning that paired well with the refreshing taste of cucumber vodka.   My date and I enjoyed a half dozen oysters, 7oz Filet Mignon, and the Everything King Salmon. The steak was tender, the salmon was fresh, and the oysters are the best I've ever had.   If you're near Fremont, stopping by the Chart House for dinner will be a meal to remember.",

Their version of the moscow mule was fabulous. My husband had the bourbon peach scallops and shrimp and it was amazing. My filet and lobster was cooked perfectly and melt in your mouth good. My husband got the dessert spiked coffee and loved it. Two of the three creme brulee sampler were equally as delicious, one not so much. Loved our dinner so much we went back for lunch the next day and their soups and salads are great too!",

We'r walked up at about 6pm and dressed really casually asked for a table for 2 and without no hesitation we'r got seated right away.  We didn't need any reservations which was great.   Our server Chrisallyn was fantastic she made sure we were treated great.  We asked for the ceaser salad to strat and she told us it's not like the normal ceaser salad it's different but the chefs can make it the way we want to.  PERFECT.. it came split for 2, it tasted fantastic just the way I like it.   We got the bread to it came with an assortment to choose from it was most and warm.  Now my favorite part the main course oh my I got the filet mignon and it wad fantastic i got it well done she explained to me what it will come out to be and i was satisfied with that.  I don't like my meat pink at all hehe... it came with aside i chose the green beans it was delicious. My mom order the same thing but she ordered it medium and it was perfect for her she chose the 3 mashed potatoes. She said it wad good.   Chrisallyn checked on us just the right amount if times if we needed anything or if we wanted more to drink.  I highly reccomend this restaurant if your visiting in the area you will love the view of the fishes swimming right by you.  You will be amazed.  Service is top notch. We chose no dessert as we were stuffed.   We had a $20 comp on our food so we gave her the players card and it was deducted off the bill.. perfect.  So if you have a player's card for the Golden Nugget check if you have any comps on food use it here!!",

Our server, Lynnette, was great, and was very helpful. We've been to Chart House in Portland once, but it was a few years ago, so we weren't at all familiar with their menu.   We tried to get in the first night we arrived in town but they had no tables available so we made a reservation for a later date. Being on vacation, we ate out for every meal, and while I wasn't particularly disappointed in any of them, this was by far the best. My husband had lobster, and while I'm not usually a seafood person, I made an exception and was delightfully surprised. This was the best seafood I've ever had in my life.   Even though I tried to save room for dessert, I barely managed a few bites of the lava cake. It was delicious and I wished I could have saved it for later.   Our birthday vacation got off to a rocky start due to a cancelled flight leaving us stranded in San Francisco, but if not for that fiasco, we would not have had this experience, so this was a nice reward.",

The only disappointments are it frequently comes out kinda lukewarm as well as the au jus. So lately, I have worked with the server, to make sure that both come out hot... why would I have to do that??  One time, I came in and substituted a baked potato for the mashed... it literally came out raw... I could barely cut into it....sent it back! But, when the rib is hot, it is possible to have the best one ever occasionally, and I will deal with the other issues as they come up.",

I appreciate that it was something different. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it either. For our meal, we had the tomahawk lamb chop and the Alaskan king crab. This lamb chop was a disappointment, on the small side and very bland. The king crab was incredibly salty. For the price point, I had hoped it would've been a lot better.",

I am a king crab freak, so I ordered the pound and a half king crab.  We devoured everything and everyone enjoyed their meals.

The service was a little too fancy for me but if you like fancy then this is the place. My prime rib was cooked perfectly but on the other hand my wife's NY steak was a little over cooked but still tasted good.",

It was absolutely the best steak I've ever had. Added to that was garlic mashed potatoes and they were excellent as well. The drawback for the main meal was the salad.   We finished with a souffle and it melted in your mouth. This place deserves five stars. Our waiter, Paris, was as good as the meal.",

Some left with leftovers.   I will say we did order a lot.   We had 8 appetizers,  The main course and 4 desserts that we shared.   Since work paid the bill,  I would have to guess that the average bill for a couple would cost around $150 with drinks.   I will say the service made it very pleasant,  I know I spoke of that already, but good service makes a world of difference.    Only one thing that I feel should be changed,  in a place of this level having tv's playing the spring events was or off place and detracted from the ambience.",

For the size $34 is waaaaay too damn much. They know they unfroze it. Argh.   The only veggies that didn't have butter or some sort of dairy product on them were the green beans. And that meant that they served them plain. How come they couldn't get a little creative?   The fiance had chicken and it wasn't seasoned well. Salt pepper cooked in olive oil is not seasoning. Dark meat or not.   Waste of $80 and they don't have a bathroom inside you have to go through the cigarette stank filled casino to use the rest room.",

To make matters worst we ordered their famous lava cake 30 min prior as recommended and when it was time for dessert the waitress came and told us the chef forgot to put the lava in the cake.  No joke!!!  What's makes things more frustrating is the fact the I mentioned all this to the waitress and nothing was done to make our visit any better.  Not even a free drink.

    "text": "In LV with the in-laws who requested a good seafood dinner. Naturally, we thought Chart House would be a good choice.  First, we arrived fairly early for dinner so it was nowhere near packed inside, but we were seated at the worst table in the house. A corner seat next to the kitchen with way too much in/out traffic to ensure a relaxing meal. We moved to a much nicer inside table closer to the fish tank.   Our server was a nice guy with a  sense of humor who seemed happy to be serving us but would've been happier if we'd ordered cocktails.  But then the food arrived...  Pop had Seared Scallops with green beans, delicious and perfect in every way.  Mom had a combo plate with Salmon and shrimp scampi served with a side of mashed potatoes and a crab cake (loaded with crab and hardly, if any, bread crumbs). The sides were cold to the touch and sent back.  Wife had the CH Special with calamari, tempura lobster and fish&chips. She didn't want fries so she ordered the green beans instead. The only items served hot were the lobster and the fish. Unfortunately, the fish were two tiny \"fish sticks\" like you'd get from a Gorton's box. If you choose this combo you'll see \"fries and more\" listed. The \"more\" is a delcious melange of fried jalapeno and bell peppers and carrots. We had the green beans and calamari served again but fresh out of the fryer the 2nd time.  I had the clam chowder, which was fan-freaking-tastic with tons of clams and very little potato. Would've liked it even more if it had been served piping hot. Also had the shrimp with garlic pasta, which should have been better than it was. I ate the shrimp and left the tasteless carb pile of pasta.  This dinner for four was $160.00 with no drinks or cocktails. At these prices we should NOT have had to return anything to the kitchen and nothing was comp'd.",

    "text": "My wife and I had our wedding reception dinner here. We actually got married in the Golden Nugget and preceded the ceremony with our wedding party at the restaurant. It was very important in our minds to have a nice dinner after with all our friends and family. To start we had a party of 35, so their event planner said we had to choose a set menu. They sent us a few sample menus and were helpful in allowing us to customize the meat and poultry options.   They do not have a banquet room but were able to comfortably seat us.  Right off the bat I knew we had chosen the right restaurant. When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation it was as if they were waiting for us, and other than our reserved seat the restaurant was filled. The event planner quickly sat us and a team of waiters and waitresses immediately started taking drink orders and bringing bread. Hors d'oeuvres came next: Bruschietta sliders, fried asparagus, and jumbo shrimp cocktail. I highly recommend all three. Soup and salad was next: the finely chopped salad was a pleaser for all but the pickiest, but i was pleased, and it seemed that the clam chowder worked well for the kids. Entrees we next: I enjoyed the 12oz. prime rib and it was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered the fillet mignon and it was also very delicious. Our other choices were sea bass and range chicken and everyone that ordered them were pleased.   For dessert we had the hotel make a wedding cake and The Chart House graciously facilitated us, we were able to cut and feed our cake to eachother right in the restaurant.  The service was top-notch and professional. The food was absolutely amazing and timely. They kept drinks flowing and quickly cleared the tables after each course. I was so impressed that my wife and I took my parents back the next night to thank them for picking up the 35 person tab.haha.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and I already went back as a testament to that.",

It looked great and she said it tasted awesome.  She got it for $30. Not bad considering what you pay at a steak house.  My husband had the fish tacos and he said they were pretty dang good.  The cocktails were excellent!  Those girls at the bar know how to make a drink!  We all walked away full and with enough alcohol in us to enjoy the \"show\" out on Fremont Street.",

    "text": "Since I have been to other Chart Houses, I expected more. This was the worse of all I have visited. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Lets mention the good first. The fish tank was beautiful and position of the restaurant in the Casino is excellent , close to a side entrance.  The service was good but average for this grade of restaurant.  Now the bad,  the entire restaurant is tiny and looks like an add on to what was a nice aquarium bar. Because of that, the seating is terrible, everyone is right on top of one another.  Some of the seating is right at the check out in the way of the entrance and exit of customer creeping by. The entrance is hard to find, really looks like you are going to the bar. Now the food, is C-, it would be an A if you were at McDonalds, but not for the prices they charge. The lamb chops were small and underccooked and not well seasoned.  My Chilian Sea Bass was good but small and not seasoned well. Sides were separate.  Worse yet I have often bragged of the excellent Caesar salad, hand made with anchovies at the Chart House. Well not at this one!. No anchovies, no hand made, no signature dish. There are so many excellent restaurants in Las Vegas, there is no need to drop several hundred dollars at this after thought.",

I made a reservation the night before the race at this restaurant b/c it was convienent and figured our 6 yr old would like the huge aquarium. Glad, we made a reservation b/c it was busy! They sat us right next to the aquarium, which was thoughtful for the little one. She loved it! Surprisingly, the food we ordered was actually pretty good! The East meets West Tuna appetizer was both unique and tasted great (high quality tuna). The little one was all over the calamari, which had a mix of peppers & tempura style veggies added. Our entrees were on par, had the halibut & hubby had a surf & turf dish, both cooked & presented well. Pleasantly surprised by this place! The cocktail menu was great too, has something for everyone. Prices aren't that bad either for what you get. Hopefully it's consistent when we come back.",

    "text": "Always pains me to give this good of a review to a chain but Chart House  held up thier end of the bargin. I showed up with my 3 year old daughter early for our 6:30 reservation. They offered to seat us at our table or a nice lounge booth. We chose the booth quickly served us a Corona and Shirley Temple with Extra cherrys. My daughter thought the Corona was perfectly chilled:) We were seated in a timely manner when the rest of the party arrived. They had no issue with a partial order so we got app's in. Ordered the 2007 Willamette Valley Vinyards Pinot Noir. Waiter came back with 08 he didn't notice the difference. Once I brought it to his attention he offered a Cali Pinot that was slightly more expensive. I stuck with the 08 it was still  good pretty light but the second half of the bottle opened up and had a little better finish. Apps were great Spring Rolls, Avacado crab mango stack, and Prosciutto-Fontina- rocket -balsamic- sliders. They were all great but those Sliders were the Belle of the Ball.....Damn tasty!  Entrees were two Blue cheese filets, one Fish-n-Chips(I just had a craving), and one kids menu Co Co Shrimp. Steaks were cooked right with plenty of bleu and carmelized onions. Fish-n-Chips were a little disappointing not entirely crisp and the chips was a melange of fries, plantains, and other random stuff. The CoCo Shrimps were a big hit with The Bean. All in all a solid dinner in beautiful setting(Love the huge aquarium)",

My guest had the braised short ribs which tasted like high school hot lunch pot roast with a sauce drizzled on top. Even the server said a lot of guests complain about it. The Oysters and the Menage soup were definitely the highlights and had I not dropped almost $200 on the meal, I would have scored it higher. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but I should have been blown away by my experience and it was lackluster at best. Service was mediocre as it took almost 10 minutes just to get greeted. 2 different managers walked by our table multiple times and never stopped once to make sure we had been helped (out water glasses were empty and the extra place setting had not been taken away so it was obvous nobody had greeted us yet). It felt like a typical Vegas restaurant that can afford to be crappy b/c they have a great location with a ton of tourist traffic. Too bad for them this local won't be back nor will I ever recommend this place to anybody.",

They now offer all this new cuisine which basically adds up to smaller portions for more money. They used to serve humungous Australian Lobster tail...now it's iny \"cold water lobster\". The Chart House would be a place for hungry sailors and surfers. Now it's more of a corporate chain trying to compete with the McCormicks and Shmidts of the world.",

When the menu was given to us her name and special birthday greeting was printed at the top of the page.   I highly recommend the Bruschetta Sliders and the Hummus Trio as an appetizer. The Chilean Sea Bass was the best cooked fish I've ever had.   The service was great. Our waiter was very attentive, every time he cleared our plates he also cleared our table cloth of crumbs. When I asked him for a wine suggestion he recommended two and brought out two samples for me to try.   The atmosphere is like most nice restaurants, but there is a huge fish tank for you to enjoy.",

The restaraunt was very crowded and the tables are practically on top of each other. Our server was nice but a little too eager, always asking how we were doing. I guess some people like that but i felt rushed. They did print my name on the menu which was nice and I appreciated and they wrapped it up at the end and provided to me. I took a photo but don't really care to keep a copy of their menu. I had the yellowfin Tuna, lobster bisque and oysters. My husband just had the swordfish. My husband liked his food and everything tasted ok as we were eating. We finished pretty fast with a $175 check for 2 drinks, 1 app, a soup and 2 entrees. We were excited about walking around Freemont street after to hit up some of the bars. We walked around after and about an hour and a half after dinner I started sweating and ended up getting majorly sick. My husband did not get sick but he did not eat the same items. We ended up having to leave and I spent the rest of the night in bed so freaking sick. I emailed Chart House on their website to let them know that I had been sick and was 100% positive it was from the food as I had felt great before I ate and had nothing after I ate. No response from the site. Overall, I was highly disappointed that they would not even respond. Who knows if other people got sick as well as Im sure the restaraunt was not even notified by the website and I was too sick to call them. Overall, highly disappointed in this experience as there are so many other great places in Vegas to eat. I just happened to pick the place with the unfresh seafood. Eat with Caution!",

The modern decor and attentive, professional staff lends itself to a rewarding meal.  We were there for a business dinner with clients from out of town.  The wait was minimal and the reservation time was met spot-on.    No alchohol involved, but the ice water and tea were served with smiles and efficiency.  Appetizers of calemari (and friends/thin sliced sweet potato fries and other tasty things) and bruschetta sliders got the talk started on the tasty tidbits.  For my entre',   I selected the 8oz filet that came with a side of mashed potatos that I wish I could make at home.  The beet was perfectly seasoned, perfectly grilled to a nicely pink medium and was as tender as it needed to be.  My co-horts selected prime-ribs and a variety of the seafood plates, including the mixed seafood grill (which is on my \"next time\" list).    To cap off a great main course, we wrapped things up with a totally awesome slice of mud-pie that was meant to feed at least the seven of us.  Portioned nicely by our server, everyone was able to leave the table totally satisfied with a slightly mocha aftertaste.  Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike, this was quite the enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "There is no doubt this is a beautiful restaurant.  Nice plush location just inside the lobby of the new Rush Tower at the Golden Nugget.  Very casual/contemporary and comfortable.  It sits beautifully surrounding a large aquarium.  Service was as good as can be expected for this type of establishment.  Service staff were friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quite good.  Started with a Mojito for me and a Mango Mojito for my lovely spouse.  We were both very pleased, these were 5 star drinks.  Also had the crab stack and it was another home run.  Then onto the main meal...the CH Specialty and the Mixed Plate.  Let's just say, we are both seafood snobs having lived a long time in Vancouver, BC and Seattle.  Sadly, the main courses were just average.  Really not too much better than a Red Lobster or similar chain place.  That's kind of sad.  But with the great location, super drinks, friendly and helpful staff we came away pleased.  Just would like to report that the main course was superb, but it just wasn't , so only 3 stars for me.",

If you're seated at the bar, it'd be quite a view.   The menu was similar to other Chart House restaurants I've been to. We had the Hummus appetizer, which was perfect to share while we had our cocktails. We shared 3 salads: the chopped, heirloom tomato, and roasted beet. We liked them all. For dinner: 2 pasta/seafood combinations, sea bass, lamb chops, and a twist on surf & turf (seared scallop and short ribs). The only disappointment was the short ribs (tender but flavorless). The portions were so generous, no room for dessert.   All in all an enjoyable meal.",

If we had known that those soups were that good we would have ordered bowls of the stuff and skipped the salads.  The bisque had a great lobster flavor and nice chunks of lobster meat. The clam to potato ratio in the chowder was spot on and also had that creamy chunky texture that makes a chowder special.  I had the roasted beet salad which was slightly disappointing in that the beet pieces were small and overwhelmed by the onions and mandarin orange slices. I would have liked to have seen more feta and less dressing. My Boyfriend had the Asian Chicken salad, it looked ok, but nothing special about it either.  Food was good but nothing spectacular.",

His dish was huge and cooked perfectly. My platter had fried calimari, fried fish, fries, coconut shrimp, tempura fried lobster tail with tempura battered veggies. It was all wonderful and not greasy at all. A wonderful dining experience! I would definitely recommend this place. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth what you get for the price!",

The orange vinaigrette, cranberries and apples garnishing the sea bass provided the perfect combo of sweet and savory.  Something I was not expecting.  We also enjoyed a signature chocolate lava cake. It takes 30 minutes to prepare so order early. Decadent but the red wine recommended by our waiter helped to make it the perfect end to dinner.",

    "text": "Normally I love this place. It WAS my favorite restaurant downtown, but the only thing that is worse than bad service in a restaurant, is bad service management.   The meal almost started good. We had to wait a while to order, but maybe there was an issue.   After we were able to order, the server kept talking over me, but we were able to order our appetizer: oysters.   Then the entrees: here's where service and managerial failures collide. I ordered the wok fried fish- I got baked fish (which was caught by another server who was great- seriously we may have had the one bad server in the room). We were going to a show, so we didn't have time for another entree, plus they ruined the last fish anyway.   Then the manager came over and gave the obligatory apology. It would've been ok at Applebee's, but come on, it's a fine dining restaurant.   Ordered dessert which was supposed to be \"lemon cucumber ice cream\". Unfortunately, the server forgot to mention the heavy amount of basil, so it was inedible.   I tried to stay positive, but everything just added up.   I went to talk to the manager, because $170 is a lot  to spend on some oysters and a crab cake.   She didn't care. She gave another fake apology and said, \" I wasn't aware of the other issues.\" I didn't realize there was a number of issues that had to happen before a manager did anything. I just figured that if I went out to dinner, I'd actually get to eat dinner.   Now I can't go back, because of this.   But it's vegas, and I can have great seafood anywhere.   And at other fine dining places, the managers understand service.",

We were talking about it all year.  We naturally made a reservation for this year.  My husband made a note in the reservation that it was our anniversary.  We were treated by the hostess and promptly seated at a table for two right next to the fish tank.  Amazing view.  Edward was our waiter and incredible helpful and personable.  We had the poke as an appetizer and it was so beautifully played, I had to take a picture.  This was my first experience with poke and I will certainly have it again!  It filled all the flavor and textures I could want.  For dinner my hubby ordered the Tour de Shrimp and it consisted of coconut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, and shrimp with a chimichurri sauce.  He ate every bite!  I had the sea bass.  It was so perfectly cooked!  Fresh and flavorful.  During our meal the executive chef came by to see if everything was to our liking and it certainly was!  Then the manager came by with an anniversary card signed by our entire waitstaff!!!!  I couldn't believe it!  THEN, Edward presented us with menus that were made just for us and it said Happy 5th anniversary!!!!  I was blown away.  The topper to the whole night was when Edward came back and gave us a complimentary dessert of a peanut butter pie with a cookie crust.  My husband and I left there feeling like celebrities.  I have never had this level of service and I can't thank Edward and the staff at the Chart House enough for making our 5th anniversary as memorable as our wedding day.",

I ordered blackened Halibut with the fruit/mango topping. It was absolutely amazing and the kick of the blackened seasoning with the mango was fabulous. Various vegetables and appetizers were pretty basic, but tasty. Yummy shrooms! A little fresh creativity would be wonderful in the appetizers and \"sides\" departments, but that's just my preference, not the quality overall.  The only negative was the hostesses. They moved us from a small table right by the fish tank, to a booth, when we requested it..... Instead of the two open booths with a perfect view of the tank, our new table was tucked in the corner by the makeshift \"water station\" for the waitstaff with a huge pillar blocking our view of the tank. As a bonus, someone was coming or going constantly, and it killed any privacy or relaxation we got in between.   It appears that it was not the designed intent of that little area....Management needs to step it up and relocate the water pitcher area elsewhere and  amend the dress code so it prohibits the hostesses from wearing outfits off clearance rack at Hot Topic. Chart House may be inside the Golden Nugget in old Vegas, but it doesn't have look like the hostesses are the offspring of their cocktail waitresses.   When I asked for a wine glass to take with my bottle back to our suite upstairs, I was graciously offered a juice glass by one of girls...really? This is what comes of hiring girls that aspire to be...nothing.",

    "text": "Chart House was never on my radar.  I used Yelp to find a place to have dinner before the book club meeting and up popped Chart House.  It turns out that I've walked by it a number of times and never knew it was a restaurant.  I only thought it was a bar/lounge.  But, behind that large fish tank is another side and that's where the restaurant is.  I was seated promptly right along the glass of the fish tank.  It's a great place to sit because you are almost constantly watching the fish swim when you're not eating--eating seafood even.  I wonder if anyone would like an enclosed, sealed calf range in a steak house.    My server was Haley and she was good.  She took my order after answering a few questions.  I was brought my iced tea (blackberry, bottled Republic of Tea) and a runner brought some bread and butter.  The bread was OK.  The rye roll was good.  It was brought warm.  The flat bread, soda wafers were quite dry and not as good.  For a started, I ordered the menage soup.  It's a trio of small cups of their three soups--lobster bisque, gazpacho, and clam chowder.  The gazpacho was hands down the best.  The clam chowder was good.  The lobster bisque was average.  For the main course, I got their spicy yellowfin ahi served with a ginger soy sauce and wasabi cream and accompanied by wasabi mashed potatoes.  The ahi was cooked very rare--just seared and off the grill.  It was excellent and the wasabi sauce was very good.  The wasabi mashed potatoes were also very good.  For dessert, I had ordered the hot chocolate lava cake.  The menu states to leave 30 minutes prep time for specialty desserts and when I was ordering dinner in the beginning, Haley asked me about this.  I ordered the cake then so there'd be plenty of time to make it at the correct time during my meal.  The cake was excellent.  Chocolate goodness topped with Heath bar crunch and vanilla ice cream.  The meal and service were very good and the fish tank is lots of fun.  It was a hoot watching the people watch the fish.  The tank is 75,000 gallons and has dozens of fish.  Haley told me that a diver is in the tank daily for cleaning and feeding.  The only drawback was that I was at the first table in from the lounge and some of the happy hour people were quite loud when they got some alcohol in them.",

I saw the other happy hour food items others ordered and they were just as generous with the portion size. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at my first tasty mojito in a long time in Vegas. Mostly Vegas bartenders make mojitos too sweet or not minty enough. Then there is the spectacular view of a fish tank teeming with tropical fish that adds a lovely atmosphere to the dining experience. the staff was friendly as well. I can't wait to come back and share this experience with more friends.",

    "text": "Wow, what a beautiful display of tropical fish in the middle of a dining experience. Is it morbid to be eating seafood while watching it swim around in circles... whatever, I don't care lol  My sister, mom, and I decided to share a couple appetizers. We were going to sit and have dinner but realized we weren't  that hungry and didn't want to take up a table, so we just sat in the bar area.  We ordered calamari and lobster shrimp rolls. The calamari we all agreed was the best we have ever had but the rolls just didn't hit the mark, why I only have 4 stars. They needed some more flavor and meat in the wrap and we got mostly cabbage mix... oh well maybe they aren't always that bad, and we got an off order. The sweet citrus chili sauce that was served along the side was very good, and maybe we are suppose to look passed the roll and focus on the sauce? Not for $16. Will be back for calamari",

The tender ribs were delicious the potatoes were on point and the lobster...well it hit it out of the park.

We came here one night on my golden birthday celebration weekend in Las Vegas. This place is amazing. My wife and I love seafood, so this was a no brainer when we were looking for places to eat in downtown Las Vegas. Although it was pricey, it had won some cool awards and the atmosphere drew us in (who can resist a HUGE fish tank in the middle of the place??).  We got lucky and scored a table right next to the fish tank. Our waiter was super, super friendly and cordial. The restaurant had printed out custom menus for the two of us for my birthday (we had made reservations beforehand). I ordered the Tour De Shrimp and my wife ordered the Coconut Shrimp. We also ordered a crab cake for an appetizer and a few drinks. The crab cake was amazing, full of fresh shelled crab no doubt. Our food was simply amazing tasting and looking. Every detail was of the highest quality. Not only did the food taste delicious, it looked delicious too.   At the end of the meal, our waiter brought out a complimentary dessert and card signed by the chefs for my birthday. I don't think I have ever been treated so well at any other restaurant. Nice finishing touch to a wonderful meal.  Yes, the food is pricey. But this is one of those rare times that I can literally say it was worth every single dollar spent.   *Also make sure to make reservations here. Since this place is so good, it is very popular and fills up very fast during dinner time.",

The ambience is amazing I LOVE the big fish tank in the center of the restaurant. So relaxing to sit and watch the fish before dinner with a drink.   Their food is delicious I get the scallops every time. My mom got the coconut shrimp she said they were delicious and the presentation wow'd us all. Grandpa got the steak, cooked to perfection with a side of their green beans (these green beans are a must order!) and grandma got the salmon which was delicious and a large portion.   All the staff is friendly the manager goes out of his way to thank you for coming and is a very nice guy. I would recommend making a reservation if your going for dinner as it gets busy!

We go out to eat at least once a day and have been to tons and tons of restaurants around the world, and my dad even said the waiter was probably the best he's ever had. The guy should definitely be working somewhere on the strip, maybe even at Twist in Mandarin Oriental or something.

The hostess asked where I wanted to sit and I told here anywhere I could get a good view of the fish tank. She told me that there was no wait at the bar and it was still full service so, being a party of 1, I opted for the bar. It was happy hour, so the bar tender gave me a happy hour menu and asked if I wanted a full menu as well. The bar tender was terrific! Super friendly and attentive and made sure everyone knew when happy hour was ending so they could get better pricing. The drinks were excellent - I had 2 fleur d'lis. For food, I had the sampler plate for an appetizer - lobster rolls, plantains chips, and tuna tower - and the prime rib for an entree - both were excellent and the steak was cooked to perfection! The ambiance was great! They have a giant fish tank that wraps around the restaurant and it is so pleasant to watch while sipping drinks and eating your meal. And the prices were reasonable for a steak house - for the 2 drinks, appetizer and dinner, it was just under $60 (got drinks and app. on happy hour price). The next time I'm in Vegas I will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I made our lunch reservations weeks ahead of our 50th wedding anniversary. I had requested a booth on the aquarium side of the restaurant as we've been there before. Upon checking in with the hostess, she seated us in the main dining room right next to the drafty/noisy entrance.  I told her about our anniversary and the reservation.....offered another table and that was that. My wife was very upset and walked out to settle down...I again asked the hostess about the booth 'How long until one opens up?' She checked and said 'two tables are finishing up but no one has dropped a check' and walked off....could care less. I saw her mention us to the manager on the far side of the dining room. He looked up at us and continued his conversation with some customers. He did so through out our meal and never once came over to chat with us, BTW he visited every other table. Our server saved the day and was very nice, knew the menu and the specialty drinks too. Kept in touch throughout the meal, very attentive. As we were finishing up I mentioned our 50th anniversary and the reservation SNAFU with the hostess...to put it mildly she was shocked and very upset. Note: the hostess never mentioned our anniversary to the server. She,our server, offered a dessert, on the house, as the least they could do. She and the manager brought out the dessert and a card signed by the staff, very nice touch. However the manager did not offer one word....nothing. The food was very good as was the wine and cocktails...but in all sincerity, the moment was lost on an inattentive hostess. So...the bottom line is do not celebrate any significant life events at The Chart House in the Golden Nugget. You will receive much more personal care at Denny's. I know....as that's where we went for dinner.",

The location: located inside The Golden Nugget hotel right off of Fremont Street this elegant location is a welcome surprise tucked in the corner away from cigarettes and noise. Beautiful floral arrangements offset the AMAZING fish tank that has a serious *wow* factor. Candle light, nice flatware.  Drinks: I had the tastiest mango mojito in Las Vegas,  sweet and minty, light ice, refreshing. My husband said the IPA was *nutty* and bold.  I ordered the seafood platter. Outstanding,tempura tilapia, shrimp, lobster, grilled scallops with skinny fries and plantain chips, served three sauces, a sweet chili, cocktail and tartar.  My husband had the steak, perfectly prepared medium rare,  fully loaded potatoes w/bacon, cheese, butter, sour cream, scallions and a side of veggies.  The girls both had the shrimp tempura with fries they gobbled up happily before we could get a sample! Shirley Temples, extra cherries.   The dessert was a DESSERT!!! It states on the menu that each chocolate molten lava cake is prepared individually and that you must allow 30 minutes for your order. Great decision to order before dinner, large cake served with hand churned peanut butter chocolate iced cream drizzled with fudge.  Oh yeah,  we will be back! Five star service, no holes to speak of.  Thanks Chart House, faith in restaurant excellence,  restored.",

    "text": "Some friends and I were in town for CosmoProf, the largest convention in the beauty industry. Let me start off by saying our service was wonderful. Our waiter was a nice man (I am completely blanking on his name right now but will update this review if any of my friends remember) who was very catering to myself, my husband, our little one and another couple (5 dinners in total).  We loved the ambiance. The aquarium is quite impressive and left my 5 month old son something very interactive to stare at. The restaurant itself isn't too large but very open while still portraying a modern feel. We started with a calamari appetizer, 3 mojitos and a glass of Malbec. The Calamari was cooked to perfection and had a nice crunch to it.  The mojitos were delish and the Malbec hit the spot. We wanted to really enjoy our evening so next we ordered some soups and salads and another round of drinks. The Clam Chowder was nice, it wasn't too salty and had a smooth texture. The Brie and Berry Salad was divine. It had just the right balance of acidity along with very tasty candied pistachios. The Roasted Beet Salad was also delish! The vinaigrette wasn't too overpowering letting all the ingredients in the salad still stand out. We then ordered Swordfish, Shrimp Pasta, Filet Mignon and Prime Rib. Now here comes the 2 star part, and it's not because the entrees were horrible but the whole ordeal in what it took to even getting our entrees.  HERE GOES: About 20 minutes after we placed our entree orders our server came up to us and told us they were \"out of mashed potatoes\" We of coarse were shocked, like what do you mean you're out of mashed potatoes, half our party ordered them to go with their steaks. He then continued to offer us a rice instead....that's a no, I mean C'mon it's steak. Then he comes back and tells us \"wait!.... I can have the mashed potatoes ready in 45 minutes\".  What is this??? POTATOEGATE?? First the potatoes are there, then they are out, then they can be ready in 45 minutes??? We agree to wait (over an hour at this point) and simply ask that we receive a free lava cake in compensation for our time. We are a reasonable bunch and understand that miscommunication happens. Well almost an hour goes by and finally our long awaited entrees arrive, they were all tasty except for one little thing. OUR MASHED POTATOES WERE COLD. Which was extremely surprising since we waited almost an hour for them. Clearly they were frozen and just thawed to the plate. We then asked to speak to a manager, we told her the ordeal and let her know that our server was not at fault and that he had been extremely kind. She however was very RUDE. It was clear she has not had much experience in the industry and offered us no explanation as to why our food was cold and didn't even offer an apology. I have never seen such disregard for the customer. When our lava cake arrived our server let us know that the manager did not approve for it to be comped. Which was an even more telling sign that she simply has no regard for customer experience. Our bill was almost $400 and she couldn't comp a $12 cake. Definitely not the level of service you expect when going to fine dining restaurant.  Overall Vegas has a plethora of fine dining restaurants so there is no need for us to bring our business back here.",

    "text": "Five-star service.  Shout out to Jeanette.  We were seated across from the amazing floor-to-ceiling aquarium per request at the time I made reservations.  That was pleasant.  Jeanette seemed to have a firm grasp of the menu and specials.  I picked a wine but sent it back before it was opened. And this is a peeve of mine and it just doesn't happen here:  Order a modest-medium price bottle of wine, say 50-$70, and it comes with a metal screw-cap.  Could probably pick it up from Trader Joe's for about $7.  Was offered other suggestions, more than I wanted to spend.  Ordered a couple of glasses from a label I knew and trusted.  Our menu was personalized to recognize our anniversary.    I had the Roasted Beet Salad which may be one of the best salads I ever had.  Arugula, roasted beets (tastier than I expected) pickled onions, candied pecans, blue cheese, all perfectly dressed in a vinaigrette.  My wife had the Ceasar.  She is a Ceasar connoisseur (she makes a damned good one, herself).  She didn't complain or compliment, only to say it was a decent sized salad.  They both were.   Fresh sourdough rolls were served right out of the oven and we had to fight the urge not to ask for more.  The entrees came out a shade too early, but that sure beats coming out late.  I had the Seafood Specialty plate:  coconut shrimp, calamari, fish, and lobster tail -- all fried. The calamari was good, cooked right with a decent breading.  The shrimp was way overcooked.   The type of fish was unknown, but it was almost inedible because of the greasy batter.  The lobster (which I suspect was a prawn) should probably never be prepared in this fashion to begin with.  Texture ok, but no flavor.  I fault myself for ordering a fried dish.  Even still, it certainly could have been better.  My wife had the Shrimp and Scallop dish.  Served with spinach gnocchi and corn in a heavy sauce.  The seafood was cooked well.  The rest of the dish seemed overly heavy and rich with little to offer the palate.    We had ordered the Gran Marnier souffle early on and it came out right on time looking gorgeous. Turned heads on its way to the table.  Served with little pitchers of raspberry and chocolate sauces.   It might have benefitted with a few more minutes in the oven, but it was very tasty.  No hint of Gran Marnier, however.    We agree that we probably should have just stuck with the salads and maybe an appetizer (or another Roasted Beet Salad!!).  We've had much better seafood dishes which cost less.  We did not expect this from a restaurant associated with the largest seafood restaurant chain in the free world.",

    "text": "This restaurant is INCREDIBLE! The restaurant is small and intimate with the giant aquarium in the middle. It provides amazing ambiance and it is entertaining to watch during dinner service.   We started off with the charcuterie board to nosh on. I loved all of it except one of the salamis and one of the cheeses were very dry and difficult to chew. Everything else was delicious and I especially loved the smoked ghouda.   I ordered the 7 oz filet topped with crab, lobster, and lemon shallot butter. The meat was perfectly tender and the lobster and crab meat on top was so tasty! I didn't get any sense of the lemon shallot butter though.   We decided to order the Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert. It was so light, fluffy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The sauce on the side was a nice touch of extra sweetness for the eggy flavor of the souffle that was here and there throughout parts of the souffle.   All in all, will definitely be back to try more of the menu!",

We stuck to the fish dishes as that was their specialty. Overall pretty well done, but their Ahi Tuna plate could use some work. The fish was too warm, it should be seared on the outside and cold on the inside. The sauces served with it were very bland, even the Wasabi sauce had no zing. One of our party had the Prime Rib, it was stringy, under done. He could only eat about half of it, the rest was trim. Another had the deep fried seafood combo plate. Greasy and over cooked. Other two mains were okay, but not spectacular. The Creme Brule for dessert was their best dish by far.  At an average of $40 per entree, not cheap and I am convinced the quality of the food does not warrant the prices they charge.  The service was exemplary. Someone spent a lot of time training the staff to provide top notch European type service.",

Therefore, this place is likely better for dinner. There are very limited selections for entrees and they were all pretty boring, with the best one being the fish of the day. Therefore, my friend and I decided to order two appetizers: the lobster and shrimp spring rolls and we also ordered the hummus platter, which comes with three types of hummus: avocado, mildly spicy red pepper, and olive, along with plantain chips and some pita. Just ok... I then ordered the farmers market salad which was good. My friend ordered the new England clam chowder which was also good. We had water. Overall, the food was OK but nothing to write home about or want to try again. The service is very friendly and the prices are reasonable. The restaurant is cute with a large aquarium and a pretty clean atmosphere.",

    "text": "We visited the Chart House for my 30th birthday. As Vegas locals we were wary of a restaurant downtown, but once inside we completely forgot we were in a casino. The aquarium was amazing and kept my 9 year old entertained the entire time. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and one staff member even took my daughter to go see the moray eel in the tank.   The food was very good, not the best I've ever had, but very appropriate for the prices. The calamari and ssanjang shrimp appetizers were delicious, the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing, the prime rib was adequate, the ahi was great, and the fish and chips was perfect. The souffle wasn't my favorite, mainly due to the texture, but the chocolate lava cake with the house special peanut butter swirl ice cream was to die for.   The staff really made this place amazing and made our experience one of a kind. Our server was so friendly and attentive. They also gave us specially printed menus wishing me a happy birthday along with a card signed with all of the staff who helped us. The atmosphere is pretty loud but that was perfect for our boisterous party of 8.   In all, I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a celebration or for a romantic date out. Just be sure to make a reservation and request a seat next to the tank.",

I was looking forward to my holiday crab leg dinner but soon realized it wasn't the place I wanted to drop $100. on a meal. Sitting at the bar for 20 minutes, two people in our party didn't have drinks. 1 other person sitting in the bar.. there's no excuse for this. I ordered a far less expensive item which came out and half of it slid off the plate onto the floor as the hostess stood there and shoved bread into her mouth laughing saying... I saw that but I'm too hungry to care. It sat on the floor the whole time. Very unprofessional, mediocre food, awful service for high prices. You'd have better luck, service and attitude at joes crab shack. I've tipped less than 15% once in my life.. this was the second. It's a shame because the aquarium behind the bar is amazing!! They need to have the service an attention to detail that their prices demand. Maybe the tables are a different story. Front of the house is a dog and pony show. The bartenders friend brought a pizza and everyone ran to get a piece. Is this high school hour or the first thing patrons see and bar patrons see at a supposed high end restaurant. Please hire people that care and are good at their jobs. I recommend that you don't go here if you expect a nice dinner with good service.",

I'm glad I did - it's easily one of my new favorites in Las Vegas.  My friend ordered the chopped spinach salad  for $10 w/  bacon, egg, radishes, mushrooms, warm bacon dressing.  It looked delicious and she really enjoyed it.  I ordered the Chopped Salad for $8 w/ cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, radishes, hearts of palm, pepperoncinis in balsamic vinaigrette and the Wicked Tuna for $17 which came as ahi tacos, tartare & pepper seared.  It was a huge serving and was displayed well.  I was happy with it.   Service was fairly decent but we did wait a long time to place ordered, get drinks, and get the final check.  We sat late in the evening and it was about 1.5 hours and none of us ordered anything of any particular length of cooking time - like steak - so it was a lengthy meal.   But for the cost, the ambiance with the fish in the glass aquariums all around, freemont street, and healthy menu options - it's a big win for me.  I can see us coming back next time we're in town.",

A steak came out well done, rather than medium rare, so it was sent back. Around thirty minutes later, after everyone else was done eating, the steak finally came back out. Mind you, we had to ask the server and the manager twice for it.  When the server handed my mom the bill I checked to see if the steak was on there. It was! I asked the server for this to be removed since he sat there and watched us eat while his medium rare steak took 30 minutes to come back out. She went to ask the manager and he agreed, finally!  Since the tip was automatically factored in for a party of 8, we didn't leave her anything extra. She was rude, slow and unattentive.

It is sad because the Golden Nugget is awesome and Vic and Anthony's is amazingly great food and service!  Wayne Gorsek",

    "text": "We were staying at the Golden Nugget, which has been completely re done. The pool area is sick, but let's talk food.  We went here for dinner and to start off we got the Calamari, which was different they any other Calamari, it was more like tempura, which veggies and other deep fried items along with calamari  Next my wife and I split the Clam Chowder, i wish we didn't i wanted it all to myself. But i know we couldn't take anything home so i didn't want to be stuff for dinner, but the Clam Chowder was great. I would almost say award winning  For dinner i got the Seared Chilean Sea bass one of the best Chilean Sea bass ever, the risotto was cooked to perfection and the lobster and jumbo lump crab was just the icing on the cake. The Sea Bass didn't have a fishy taste and just fell apart with the fork. I'm getting hungry just writing this.  My wife got the Miso Glazed Salmon she loved it, i tried a bit, but i felt that my dish was so superior that her dish just tasted ok. But my wife had the same passion for her dish as i did for mine.  Even if you are on the strip this place is worth the drive just to eat here.",

The Mixed Grill is always good, and my favorite entree is the Macadamia Encrusted Mahi-Mahi.  It was still awesome.  I usually try the award-winning clam chowder for an appetizer, but this time I went with the soup trio to still get the chowder as well as the bisque and the gazpacho.  While all Chart House locations are usually built around some water-related view, I had read that this Las Vegas location was built with a view of the shark tank.  It wasn't.  It's True there was a view of a large salt water aquarium but not a view of the shark tank that makes up the middle of the Golden Nugget swimming pool, which was very disappointing.  It's a much smaller version of the other Chart Houses I've been to, and the server didn't ask us if we wanted to order the Chocolate Lava Cake when we placed our original order (which you have to do since it takes so long to make), so I forgot to order it and was a little bummed, but the food was still awesome nevertheless.  Park in the Golden Nugget parking garage and make sure to hit the left end of the Cashier Cage to push your parking ticket under the validator before you leave, so you don't have to pay for parking.",

The last of the reviews for this week in Vegas . . . the Chart House . . . Seafood or Meat . . . No choice to be made here  . . . This is a MEAT week.  Ribeye for me, but more on that later.  I sat at the bar waiting for my business associate to arrive.  Contemplated having my choices in cocktails, which for me centers on bourbon or cachaca . . . Leblon or Bookers.  No choice . . . cachaca distilled by a Frenchman aged in American oak by a company that had no sales presence in Brasil prior to the Cabana cachaca beating . . . ask if you want the detail . . . or Bookers uncut Kentucky Straight Bourbon.  I am an American in the larger sense . . . I try to drink spirits from here . . . tonight is bourbon time.    Side note . . . Some one please import good aged cachaca to the USA.  Sagatiba has their velha but it is not in the same league as Armazem Veiera Onyx for example.    Two sips and off to the table.  I order my typical steakhouse meal - beefsteak tomato salad, ribeye steak (love the fat of the cut) and sauteed mushrooms.  The slices of the beefsteaks were too thin, but the chef gives the salad a twist . . . instead of raw onion he supplements it with an onion ring on each, sadly thin, beefsteak slice.  HE SHOTS, HE SCORES.  Nice twist.  The steak is really good, but not up to the same level as the other ribeye of the week.  Shared bottle of merlot with my associate . . . I prefer wines with more balls . . . a Malbec or a Zinfindel perhaps.  But I did not order the wine . . . so who am I to complain . . . wait I just did . . . What a jerk.  Finish the meal with a cup of coffee, yeah those of you that know me are not surprised.    On the walk back to my room, there is that fish tank by the pool . . . Those redfish look like groupers . . . forget the restaurant tank I want to fish this tank from above from the bar.   In the end, would I return?  HELL YES . . . Chart House is a chain but there is innovation and dependable meat and seafood . . . high quality and excellent relaxed service . . . if only they had some cachaca velha.",

We were meeting a photographer at the Golden Nugget this time, though, so we decided to explore a little.  The Chart House lured us in with their gorgeous decor and particularly their giant aquarium in the middle.  What was going to just be a drink and apps turned into dinner.   We started out with a yummy Hummus trio- I especially liked the Edamame flavor, which was refreshingly different.  For dinner, I had the seafood mixed grill: mahi, mediterrenean shrimp, and a crab cake.  It was all fantastic, especially the shrimp.  I could eat that shrimp every day for the rest of my life.  The fiance had a NY Strip- beautifully cooked and tender.  We also got a side of fried mac n' cheese and it was heavenly.  Service was top-notch.  The mango mojito was fantastic, too.  This is just a great place for a really nice, but not pretentious, meal on Fremont Street.",

The lobster bisque had so much sherry in it my stomach started rebelling and there was very little lobster taste...I've had much better elsewhere.  The lava cake was more like luke warm chocolate pudding cake...not even close to the quality I expect when charged 11 dollars!!!  Go to Olives...better food better atmosphere and a fair price for high quality fare.  Sure...Chart house has a cool aquarium. ..but Olives has the Bellagio fountain :-).

Lobster bisque was delicious (though the temperature could have been warmer).  The bread basket had some very nice selections - the brown bread was our favorite.  Husbands fish and chips were cooked to perfection with lots of extra \"crumblies\" along with the fried haddock and french fries that included some fried slivers of sweet potato and plantains to make the dish truly interesting.  My Halibut La Griglia with champagne grape sauce was topped with a generous portion of lump crabmeat and came with a side of saffron risotto, grilled asparagus and roasted tomato.  The halibut was cooked to perfection - moist and flaky and the sauce was not overpowering.  The saffron risotto had a beautiful flowery taste and the grilled vegetables were a perfect accompaniment.   Good wine and cocktail selection and service.  Definitely the place to eat downtown.",

Having dinner in front of the fish tank was awesome but made me wonder if the fish I was eating was the lucky one to get plucked outta the tank.   I was surprised that they had made a personalized menu for my table. Apparently they ask if anyone is celebrating a special occasion when you call to make reservations. I thought this was pretty cool. Plus they let me keep the personalized menus. A very nice gesture.  Ok on to the food, the sea bass with saffron risotto was tasty. I think I enjoyed that better than my dish. I had the stuffed flounder, which was good but the flounder had no flavor and a little dry until you mixed it with the crab. The sea bass though, mmm. I also heard that the jumbo stuffed shrimp, surf & turf, and fish & chips were very enjoyable.   Overall the experience was awesome especially since it was in downtown. Our waiter Eddie was funny, very helpful and willing to split our checks. Towards the end of our dining experience, they brought out their Hot Chocolate Lava Cake and Eddie initiated the Happy Birthday song. Kudos to this guy! I heart Downtown Vegas and find it appealing when you find these hidden gems in that area.",

    "text": "Maybe they were short staffed, but ate here for the first time last weekend and wasn't impressed.  Hostess and wait staff weren't attentive and very slow...for the price of dinner for two, I expected more.  Food wasn't that great either.  We had crab claws, sword fish and scallops.  Didn't taste very fresh...Have had much better at this chain else where.  Atmosphere was 5 stars...fish tank is amazing.  Will give them another chance in future in hopes that food and service will match atmosphere next time!",

If you want to see the most amazing fish tank you've ever seen, this is the place.  Even though it is an open restaurant in the Golden Nugget, the noise level isn't noticeable.",
