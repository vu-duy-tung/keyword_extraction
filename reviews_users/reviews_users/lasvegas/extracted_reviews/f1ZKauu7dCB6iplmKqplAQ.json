We liked the banquet menue since the fish dish and the other seafood dish were very fresh. Overall great experience.  It's definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants off the strip in Vegas.",

I came to this spot a couple of times when it was Cathay house and it was just ok. I decided to come here because of the ratings not knowing it use to be Cathay house since my friend was the one who yelped it. It looked almost the same and the carpet is dirty hence semi remodeled. Anyway, we sat down and the lady with the short bob like haircut gave us our drinks and I asked for straws (majority of places automatically brings you straws), with her bland face seemingly irritated, she walks off without a word, comes back and throws the straws on the table as I was reaching thinking she was going to hand them to me so I'm like ok, rude. Then we sat there waiting, like where's the cart? This other customer sitting right next to us over hears and says, you have to order off of this and shows us the menu. So we asked the our waitress( the lady with the bob) and she says oh sorry and brings us one. After all that we decided to leave because we were expecting a cart and wanted to see the food not read the food. Lol. I know this review is long but I wanted to be detailed. We didn't even get a chance to try the food because we were turned off by the unfriendly service. I'm definitely not coming back.",

As usual, we were the only two non-orientals in the restaurant, a good way to know the food is  authentic.  The servers come by with carts filled with metal steamers containing 2 or 3 pieces of each item. If you see something you want, get it then as you may not see it again.  When you realize the time involved in making these dishes, you can understand why your bill will be higher than at a traditional Chinese restaurant but it's well worth it.  Turnover is slow so if you want to make sure you don't have a wait, come soon after it opens or 1 to 1 1/2 hours later.  If your children don't like trying new foods, leave them at home.",

It was a bad sign when we walked in and saw people sitting at about 8 of the tables, and maybe 2 of them had food. And not a lot of food - just one or two plates. The rest of the tables were completely empty and all the customers looked bored and angry. Not a single dim sum cart to be seen. I was so confused that I actually asked the waiter, \"Is this dim sum?\" He said yes. It was almost ten minutes before we saw one cart, and it was mostly sesame balls and other desserts. More and more customers kept coming in, but no food to be seen. We could tell that we were not going to be fed if we stayed, so we got up and walked out. As we left, I saw the main dining room and it was the exact same situation.  One cart, room full of tables with no food. Nobody seemed to care when we left. It must be a common occurrence.",

All of the dishes come out and almost finished, then the steam fresh fish come out.  A fish comer with lot of ginger and green onion, we put ginger and green onion on side.  We noticed the fish is freeze fish, not fresh fish.   Fresh fish is taste completed difference of freeze fish. I think every one knows how is fresh fish and how is freeze fish taste. We told waiter about.  He was sorry about and  willing to take $10 off from our bill.  I said the fish cost $57.00 dollars, only took $10 off is better not take off.  We paid full price for freeze fish $57.00.  After that, I never go back to this terrible restaurant again.  I am local.  There are many Chinese restaurant in China town Las Vegas.  I prefer go to other restaurant rather go to Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum Cafe because it is not honor to customer.",

They have a variety here, and the service is fast, but the taste was average. We had soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and the the skin was so thick, it was chewy. They serve it in small tin foil so it is easier to eat, but they are disappointing. The combination dumpling was huge and good. The hai gaow was just so-so. Again the wrapper was more thick glutinous mass but the shrimp filling was okay. It was neither good or bad. Just so. After those dishes, we decided to leave. We had one other dish but I can't remember it now. On the other hand, we haven't found great dim sum here yet that is in this price range. I think the dishes were about $4-5 per dish.",

We had a fairly big party and 5 minutes after we were seated, the server came over and just asked \"ready?\" without introducing herself or offering drinks. She was just not very welcoming. I asked for waters around the table, Tom Yum soup to start for the table, and also asked if we can have just a couple minutes to get our order together (as we were ordering a lot of dishes and eating family style). The server just nodded her head and walked away with an attitude. Once waters came around the table, a different server came by to take our order. After ordering, we sat there waiting for the soup and after about 15 minutes pass, we notice every other table who were seated after us received their soups and dishes. When the first server walked by, my dad said \"excuse me\" to get her attention & ask about the soup, and she literally paced off, waving her hand saying \"yeah, yeah, soups coming.\" It's somewhat understandable when there's a language barrier, but it honestly felt like she was purposely being rude because she had a bad day or just didn't want to be there.  Now, on to the food. The portions for some of the dishes are decent for the pricing. A lot of the main meat dishes that had vegetables and onions (like the Mongolian beef we ordered) had too much peppers and onions and not enough meat..if I wanted a vegetarian dish, I would have ordered it. The dish we did enjoy was the crispy pan fried noodles and that's about it. Overall, the food is just alright and well, their service.....not so much.",

The parking lot is pretty  damned small so I can imagine it being bananas on weekends.  I also like that they open at 9am when most dim sum places in town open at 10am. I highly  recommend  this spot but if you're  looking  for friendly warm service than  look elsewhere.",

Is it possible that they have the greatest dim sum ever made? I suppose. It's not that their service was bad. It's that there was no service at all. Never coming back here. If I were you, unless disappointment tastes good to you, I would just go to another dim sum place. There are plenty of them here in Vegas.",

Everything we got was very respectable (think the typical grew-up-with-immigrant-Canto-parents order: ha gao, siu mai, fong jao, pai gwut, etc.); the unanimous standout item was the dan tat (egg tart). The crust was a great kind of flakey, and the custard was the right amount of sweet. The best part for us was the price point: the six of us ate for $48, after tax and tip. I was honestly pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, and would recommend it if you're feeling dimsum in the Vegas area.   Further notes: My dim sum credentials, if you care: I grew up in the Bay, college and onward in LA, have eaten at all of the go-to SGV dim sum places, and have had solid HK dimsum.  And miscellaneous comments: the bathroom smells like a Chinese restaurant bathroom, the cart aunties speak Canto and Mandarin as expected, the baked/fried food cart (e.g. cha siu chan bao, jeen loh bak go) is served barely warm (but i mean, what do you expect?), and the service is as you should expect in a legit Chinese restaurant.",

When I used to live in California they would only push the carts with dim sum on Saturday and Sundays and on weekdays you would just have to order. Here at Hong Kong's they do it everyday and all day! It's great! Dim sum consists of small shareable plates usually with steamed dumplings, buns, and meats. We love to get the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, pork buns, and steamed spare ribs. (just to name a few) It is usually always bustling but you never have to wait very long to be seated. Quality of the dim sum is good and price is super cheap! If you never tried dim sum, give it a try. Just take a look and pick what you want. Oh and don't forget to pair it with some tea! :)",

There was a mass of people inside and a couple outside had me thinking it would be a long wait. But it moved pretty fast. We went at around 9ish so it was a pretty busy time but we got seated after like 15mins. The food was good! My favorites were the honey bbq pork buns and the pork spare ribs. Everything else was pretty solid and couldn't complain. Service was not bad but they were busy so it seemed like the waiting staff was spread pretty thin.

Food was ok, and selection was pretty limited but has all the usual like chicken feet, shumai, and others.  Service here was pretty quick as expected with most dim sum restaurants anywhere you go. Getting in is usually the difficult part as lines are always long. That's what you'd expect if you go to other places here in town but this one had lots of open seating available. The food wasn't bad enough to stay away so it's definitely worth the go if you want to skip all the pleasantries of other more popular places.   Be warned though, it is a Chinese owned restaurant so most of the employees speak very little English. You'll be fine as long as you can point at what you want to eat but don't ask questions because they most likely won't understand what you're asking.",

Usually the tea pots have a catcher for the tea leaves. Ours did not. So every time we poured, we basically got a cup of tea leaves. The tea was sooo dark. We asked for oolong and it looked like we got gook bo.   The food was alright.  The fried taro puffs, wu gok, were tasty. Definately used more taro than most restaurants that substitute potatoes. Most items came out hot. The egg tarts were fresh but they were taken out too soon, and were not set in the center.   The paigwat tasted more like jalapeno, no black beans that I could remember. But maybe that's just how my Yeh Yeh used to make them.   The rice noodle wrapped char siu, was bland. Not a lot of flavor at all in the BBQ pork.   Decent cost, but forgot to use the Yelp discount.

I didn't know where it was because it is actually the old Cathay House location off of Lindell.   I was already meh because Cathay House was an okay dim sum place with junky service and a rep for being closed down repeatedly. I think they just re-vamped the decor and changed the name because staff was mostly the same.   As for food, the food was good. Nothing that blew me out of the water but definitely satisfying for a dim sum craving. Staff seemed generally more tentative than I'm uses to for dim sum.. and continuously cleared plates and refilled our hot tea. This will more than likely continue to be my go to dim sum place whenever the craving hits. Good food and busy but nice atmosphere.",

What in her right mind she have the right to say that to guests dining in this establishment.   I tried ordering food, before I can order a second plate they pushed the dim sum carts and ran. So I had to shout for them to return so I can properly order my dim sum. Secondly I ordered my pork bun to be reheated, 20 minutes. That lady went MIA with it. For god sake she stamped my card for it too !!!   The food is always good, but the service is a joke. Probably one of the worst service I've seen in Las Vegas. Poor management needs to get their stuff straighten out.   May or may not return, still deciding on that. But my temper with this place is leaning towards the no as of right now. If you're from Vegas or not a local it's probably not worth your time and stress walking into this place.",

You know it's the best when the only people eating here are actual Chinese people.  We were seated in a side room so I was naturally worried that we wouldn't be served by the carts.  Yes carts, which a lot of places don't use anymore.  As soon as we were seated, we ordered traditional green tea.  The steamed shumai and haw gow were perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The steamed chasu bao reminded me of the ounces I ate as a child.  The piece de resistance were the dan taat- egg custards have gotten minuscule and tasteless and yet these happy little tarts were amazing. We tried a few other favorites all just as good as I ate when I was a child.  So take the time to indulge in these happy little flavors in Sin City!",

(They have another branch by Jones close to 168).  They have complimentary soup during dinner time which is nice especially in a cold winter night. I ordered foie gras with truffles with an Asian twist and that was excellent. Creamy foie gras melts in your mouth and amazingly good. Will probably order this again.  Hubby wanted the tried and True seafood tofu hotpot and salt pepper pork chop, and they did not disappoint.  Service was excellent which is unusual in a real Chinese place. Our server checked on us several times and refilled our teapot without us asking. They also offered complimentary sweet red bean dessert after our meal.   I'm docking one star as the place itself is old and dated although they tried hard to renovate it. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I want with trash can almost full to the brim. Maybe because we came late night almost closing time for our meal?  Overall, the food and service are excellent and the price is reasonable. I will come back to try their dimsum next time.",

    "text": "This restaurant is one of the places to go if you crave for authentic and very good dim sum at a very affordable price. It was originally named Cathay Seafood & Dim Sum Restaurant. It was renamed As Jade Restaurant under a different management, sadly, the taste of their food changed also, which turned off many regular patrons of the former.   Luckily the current name offered the same quality of dim sum they once had. After avoiding to eat at this place for two years, we are back at dining here again. The only downside of this restaurant is the service which needs a lot of improvements  I only rated this 4 stars due to their not so good service. Other than that, we can't complain because of the deliciousness of their dim sums.  So regular patrons! You can comeback now!",

This place blew us away!  The first dumpling we ate was the chive dumpling and it was so flavorful and juicy  I couldn't believe it was so delicious.  The shu mai was one of the best I had and the baked char Sui bar was light and flavorful.  The Hong Kong style noodle was also amazing-- I would highly recommend it.  It wasn't greasy and there was no MSG residual after effects.  My dad declared this as better than any dim sum place in Northern CA (where he now lives) and even better than any in San Francisco and Hong Kong.  Also, I need to add that the service was attentive and impeccable (both times) which is a rarity in a Chinese restaurant.  My only feedback is the Xiao Lin Bao is not a specialty here, although the meatball is tasty and juicy, the dumpling is served on a little metal cup and has the tendency to stick.  I think if they served it in a bamboo steamer it might work well, but they way it is now it's not worth it to order.  Nonetheless, this place has amazing dim sum!",

This is our go to spot for dimsum, though I do wish they had more carts circulating. Go-to dishes are the bbq pork with rice noodles, turnip cake, and the clay pot noodles and bean curd sheets. Yummmm  Dinner prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity you get! You get a complimentary bowl of soup along with your meal, as well as a dessert at the end. We always order a meat, veggie, rice, and poultry dish, and the tab always ends up being below $45 with 3 boxes of leftovers for the next morning :) The food is fantastic, and is as close to authentic Chinese food as you can get in Vegas. The service during dinner is also extremely attentive, especially if you have Gordon, the tall gentleman with the glasses or the young man with the left ear piercing as your server. Salted Fish and Chicken fried rice, and half an order of duck are my go-to's here.",

I visited this place on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch and the place was packed with locals.  Seeing many local Chinese at a Chinese restaurant is a good sign that the food is good to great.  I was not disappointed as the variety of dim sum was plentiful and everything tasted freshly made and delicious.  The atmosphere was bustling, and noisy as can be expected in a popular dim sum restaurant.  Carts circled around tables frequently so there were no dead spots where you sat waiting to see what was next in offerings.  You won't be disappointed at this place.  This will be my \"go to\" place when I'm in Vegas for sure.  Oh yes, and don't forget the Jin Dui (fried seseme balls with red beans inside), and the egg tarts.  These were PERFECT!",

    "text": "TLDR : This building is a relic, pre-dating myself; however, over the years it has gone through different owners but now I have to say that the resident chef has his food on lockdown for dinner. The dim sum, is so so.  I ideally would prefer to just come for dinner.   -----------------  Dim Sum:  Almost all of the dim sum choices were par for the course.  The individual reviews are going to be super picky but for a dim sum place with that many small portions of food it was good.   1) The shrimp dumplings were correctly sized, although one problem was the skin broke away on the bottom.    2) The turnip cake was ok, but I generally like them with a bit of texture from the solid turnip cuts. the one here was either just all flour or very very well processed turnip.   3) Shiu Mai was par for the course and just down right good.  4) Lotus Sticky Rice was good, but could have used a bit more meat inside.  5) The yellow bean custard buns were solid, could have used a bit lighter coloring but overall good.  6) The egg tarts, were the star of dim sum.  I have never eaten an egg tart that tasted like that one did, butter.  It's clear that the chef loves butter and egg tarts because the aromatics were there, which enhanced the overall experience.   All in all, there might be better dim sum but this is a good choice in Las Vegas right now  Dinner:  For dinner get the pork belly and pickled vegetables and here's one for adventurous souls who want to try a traditional home cooked dish, try the steamed minced pork cake and salted fish.  For those who know how to speak canto the direct literal translation is (salted fish + steamed + pork meat + cake)  After one bite of the minced pork cake and salted fish I felt like I was the reviewer in movie Ratatouille.  The flavor was on point and the pork cake was tender and juicy just like when my aunt had cooked for me when I was 5. There truly is no comparison but be prepared the chef does have a very good salted fish and well..it's salty and flavorful, which is rare these days.  I will be coming back the next time someone asks where I want to eat in Las Vegas!",

We also ordered the fried crab balls that we love so much and expect to be juicy and bouncy. Theirs was tougher than usual and tokenly moist. My Husband ordered walnut shrimp and they came draped- literally draped- in a slightly watery mayo sauce. Given he wasn't enjoying the dim sum and ordered the a la carts item out of desperation, he ate it anyway. If this were dim sum place in the middle of nowhere, UT, perhaps it might be a 3 or 4 given the lack of competition.

I would say the only downfall to this place is that it is pretty small so if you do have a large party to accommodate to I would recommend a larger location. You are kind of crammed for space in there, the back of people's chairs are hitting the back of yours, etc... In addition to that, the dim sum carts do not come around as often as you'd like because it is so small. If you are not a patient person I would recommend ordering from their menu.   Overall, for a small family like mine I do not mind too much.",

After getting seating in what seems to feel like a back overflow room we waited for service. They only had 3 carts going around and you had to wait or waive them down to get dim sum delivered to your table. The servers were nice but you had to get their attention to get service as they didn't come around to check up on our table.   Food wasn't as great from what I remember,  service was aight, and just not what it used to be. Will not be coming here again and will need to look for a new spot.",

I see they try to keep the place clean but I hope they will try more and more especially minor detail like utensil, dishes and tea cup. Otherwise they might get shut down like Orchid Garden.   I will come back again with my friends and try more next time. Let's see if it will be better ..   2nd visit  Maybe we know how it works here this time. We got food!! lol I like it.

Here's the lowdown ~  THE GOOD: - price point is cheaper than most - custard buns with salted egg  THE DECENT: - food quality and flavor is okay  THE BAD: - the service is extremely rude  When I come to Chinatown, I by no means expect stellar service. But this place dips below indifferent efficiency. Flagging someone down is not only difficult, but they'll often walk away while you're talking to them. Plus, they're not very subtle once you've paid the bill to get you out the door. If you add on how uncomfortably hot and humid it is in the restaurant, it could be a real deal breaker during Vegas summers.  Overall, I don't mind paying a lil' more for some polite service and better quality dim sum. And if you share that sentiment, I'd recommend you too skip Hong Kong Garden.",

We got chinese vegetables and they were over cooked. There was this platter with chicken, roast pork, and crispy pork. Also disappointing I feel like the crispy pork was old. It was not very crunchy at all. There was this jelly fish stuff below it that was good but that's bought. I've bought it before. No one was in here when we got here and should've taken that as a sign. Plenty of parking outside and a lot of seating inside. Overall #kevindoesnotwant",

We came in for Dim Sum at 11:30 am and the food was fresh and \"GUCCI!\" The food carts were on clock work.  The ladies were loud and pushy.  You get a good workout standing up and down looking at their selection.  The food here has low msg.  I only felt half sleepy but maybe because I ate too much beef balls and turnip cake.  This place is good and clean.  I highly recommend this for lunch and big parties.

And so...  Breakfast:  Hong Kong Garden Seafood  Summary - Good and perhaps the second best in Vegas.  Har Gao Benchmark - Relatively thin, translucent, highly glutinous crystal skin with good moisture content.  Shrimp within a good blend of previously frozen paste and pieces, well seasoned, MSG evident.  Service - Carts.   Price - In line.  Inexpensive.  Authenticity - 90% Asian / majority of that, Cantonese speaking clientele with a few misspellings in the menu.  Selection - All the standards.  Shu mai - Good blend of coarse and finely ground pork and shrimp paste.  MSG heavy (a good thing).  Wrapper, tough.  Very little crab eggs on top. Beef ball - Spongy texture, somewhat airy, slightly sweet. Steamed BBQ pork bun - Reheated?  Outside dry.  Filling very sweet.  Chicken feet - Tender, pull apart.  Lots of flavor. Beef tripe - Very tender.  Good ginger, sesame flavor punched up by MSG. Beef tendon - Clean, tender, but not packing much flavor. Egg tart - Flaky, lardy crust.  Custard sweetness well controlled. Baked sweet cream bun - Warm. Crisp on the outside.  Cream filling overly sweet. *Fried items not sampled.  All looked oily and as if they were sitting for a while.  Note - Cantonese not English is the language of choice.  Off menu special items and larger portions of favorites (ie tendon and tripe) offered only to ummm, \"preferred customers\".    Hawaii yeeps, this doesn't surpass what we have at home.  Solid by Vegas standards.",

Order a load of group plates from their massive menu, get a big bowl of soup and some white rice, and you can feed a family for a fraction of the cost it'd run you elsewhere. Staff is attentive, hard working and friendly. Also, the dining area is super spacious and the seating is plentiful.  I haven't had the dim sum but I imagine it's just as good.  You may find a better spot if by yourself or with another person, but if you've got a group of 3 or more this is definitely a great spot.",

The restaurant had only one occupied table which could mean we were going to have a poor experience but we pressed on and ordered from both the Dim Sum and regular menus. Our lives have been changed!  I can't remember everything we ordered, but I certainly remember the Chicken Fried Rice, the Dumplings and tofu wraps!  How have we not known about this place?  Seriously great food!  While we were eating, suddenly the restaurant began filling up. We had just gotten there too early it seems. I'm gonna post pics but I can't remember everything. Sorry.

We were spoiled when our friends in LA took us to lunasia for the first time and have been trying to find a comparable place in Vegas. They have all your typical dim sum dished and also crab congee - which was new to me. It had pretty good flavor to it and actually had a whole crab in it. If you're into that kind of stuff - you should at least try it. 1 server and 1 busser were there serving probably 7 tables but they were hauling ass. Good job guys! Keep up the food quality.",

One time we walked in forgetting both of our wallets, the cart lady offered to pay for our meal. Being Chinese I had to make my husband drive home to pick up money, but the gesture was super sweet.",

We ate their crispy chow mein with bean sprouts, sticky rice with scrambled egg, xiao mai, rice porridge, white radish cake, pork spareribs, and small egg custard tarts (my favorite dessert).

I really enjoyed this beef tendon and rice noodle dish that I've never seen at other dim sum places. It's more of a normal lunch dish, but was good to share among a large group. Beef tendon was really soft and savory.  shumai - Really savory and juicy, somehow significantly better than other versions I've had. Really standout.   egg tarts - They are amazing. Seriously get them, really nice flaky crust and soft egg custard center.   seaweed salad - Surprised to see this at dim sum, looks like seaweed salad from Japanese restaurants, but it was really good. Nice of have some \"veggies\" in the otherwise meat/seafood and fried foods heavy dim sum meal.   tofu skin wrap - This was also very juicy and delicious.   thousand year egg congee - a bit watery and underwhelming. Wouldn't recommend.   In general everything we tried was really good. Plus it was really cheap, with our bill (after stuffing our faces) coming out to less than $10 after tax and tip.",

    "text": "Having tried just about every dim sum place in town, there's no doubt I had to try this place out. I did hold some type of expectation for this place as this is a sister restaurant of the one on Jones (but this location serves dim sum).   Overall, I would say this place has potential.   SERVICE; 4/5 Came in on a late Monday afternoon, after the lunch rush. Not packed, but not empty either. We did run into a problem with not being asked what tea we wanted (one of the first things they ask you when you are seated), and we notified them after sitting around. They were sincerely apologetic, and I was surprised because most dim sum places wouldn't think twice about it. The ladies pushing the cart were also friendly. Didn't give us that \"whatever\" attitude. At one point, we finished all our food and no more carts were pushed out. Again, sat around then flagged someone down. Service was great as they were also apologetic, and the guy offered to bring over the dishes we wanted.   ENVIRONMENT; 2/5 I definitely think they could work on how the place looks. Maybe they are still in the process of decorating since they are new? I felt like I was eating in a prison room as there were nothing on the walls at all. Oh well...I am here for the food.  FOOD; 3.5/5 Unfortunately, I realized that I did not get to try more of what they had to offer which is why I'm docking off stars. Maybe because we came after peak lunch hours, but still disappointing. They should've been prepared.  I heard good things about their flowing custard bun (lau sa bao), but they said they were out. Wanted to try as it is one of my favorites, and good ones are nonexistent in Vegas. They apparently have soup dumplings too (xiao long bao) but none were available.  Shrimp dumplings (ha gow), rice noodle roll (cheung fan), and egg tarts (dan tat) were very good. Shrimp dumplings were juicy and loved the soy sauce they use for their rice noodle roll though I'll admit that noodle was not as silky as I would have wanted it. I would say that their egg tarts are more True to Hong Kong style aka flaky crust!",

I ordered several dim sum items, including fried shrimp & pork wontons, har gao, steamed pork buns & lotus rice and about 5 other dumpling type items. The service despite there being only 2 other customers when I arrived was quite slow & unfriendly. My server seemed annoyed at the presence of customers. Overall, the food was just ok. Nothing to write home about for most items I ordered. However, the fried shrimp wontons were fried a bit too long so they were dark brown & crunchy as opposed to golden & crispy as you'd want them, the har gao was a little on the cold side, and the steamed pork buns had been steamed so long they exploded. Also, despite not asking me if I was done & before everything I'd ordered came out, the server brought me a check for the items she'd brought out. While I appreciate them not attempting to charge me for food I hadn't gotten, she again seemed annoyed when I pointed out I hadn't gotten all my food yet. Ultimately they came out, buns blown out as mentioned. Overall the place was mediocre & unfriendly and I couldn't help but wonder why food cooked in steamer baskets came out so slowly. The food wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. I'd only come here again late night if I couldn't find another option to try.",

We sat there for almost 10 minutes without beverages, and we only got some because we had to flag down one of the workers. Oh and the hot green tea we ordered was filled with a bunch of leaves at the top (more than what's usually in the pot), we had to pour out excess tea and scoop out the leaves. I also felt like we got skipped a lot with the carts even though we tried making eye contact and calling them over.",

Read review that said it is flaky, well, that is what it is supposed to be. Takes a lot of work to make it like that (the crust).  Price, clearly the best you can find in Vegas. About half the price of Ping pang Pong whose food quality is sporadic anyway (stuffed pepper barely warm and nowhere near hot by the time you get it off the cart). Service? definitely depends on how busy it is (like any other restaurants). I don't find the service to be anywhere as bad as what other reviewers described. If there is a plumbing problem (which can happen anywhere), clearly the workers would be a lot busier and service won't be up to par. I think it is unfair to hold that against any restaurant unless the plumbing problem is frequent. Service is usually much better around dinner time when they are less busy.",

Sure, they have 2 giant banquet rooms, with lots of seating and tables available, but what's the point of all the tables if you can't turn the food around?  My family and I arrived at 6:30pm last night for dinner--my brother was craving some Chinese food.  We had our order in by 6:45... by 7:30pm, we only had 1 of our 6 dishes arrive.  It was the roasted pork, which is usually a pre-made dish-- and we only got this after my parents asked the wait staff if they could rush our order because we were trying to get to Wynn for our 9:30pm showing of Le Reve.  We looked all around us and there were numerous tables waiting for their food-- it looked like those who ordered simple dishes all got their food, while the ones who ordered slightly more complex dishes never saw their food.  In the end, after waiting for a full 50 min w/ only a measly roasted pork dish, we cancelled our whole order-- it was obvious that even though the waiters tried rushing our order for us, the kitchen was completely backed up and still hadnt' worked on our table.  We left pretty hangry and went to Urth Caffe for dinner prior to the show instead.  So... I can't really comment on the food, but not because I don't want to, but because the service was so bad that I never even got to try it.",

It's been a dim sum restaurant for decades so I was a little relieved. We know to go on a weekday and to get there early. Arrived at 11:00, was seated immediately for a party of 5. Turns out they're not crazy busy on a weekday. Carts were full and had plenty to choose from. Everything was fresh, hot and tasty. Servers were friendly and they didn't rush us even though we sat for a while just talking. I noticed once we paid the bill, the busboy comes over to clear the table, so I told my family, it's time to go. No problem!  I've read past reviews and about some concerns when dining there in the early morning hours since they're opened 9am - 6am. The servers then were not customer oriented and there was concerns about what was in the food, etc.  Based upon that, I'll only come here for dim sum before noon and on a weekday.  I can make this a regular stop for me when I'm in Vegas!",

My family and I come here often and our favorite are so many...like beef bittermelon,  fried flounder, chowfun, preserved pork, and schezuan eggplant. So YUMMY!!! Prices are also very reasonable. Every time we have visitors, there is no problem where to eat coz we know HK Garden will be open. THANK YOU HK GARDEN! We will see you soon again.",

Other than that cleanliness, we had a great time and the staff was very nice.  They give free dessert if you say it's your birthday.  Checking through yelp and you can get 10% off your bill, or don't so they can use that money to remodel.  Cheers!",

    "text": "I keep coming back because the prices are way cheaper than most restaurants. However...is it worth it? I receive food poisoning from this place 2/5 times. It's Russian roulette with this place. You can either get a delicious soul satisfying meal, or a 5 hour session on the toilet. From what I've learned from this place is that the older servers seem to have something against younger patrons, they are very rude, but are nice to older customers. I usually eat there twice a week and I see the same routine every time. The younger servers are way nicer, and always take care of the me. However, I'm writing this because of the food. I've had diarrhea 3 days straight now, and I'm barely recovered today. I believe it was the House Special chicken, it's usually served cold. I expect that chicken was way past it's expiration date, so I advice to ignore it. The road duck and crispy chicken are usually good, but as of right now I'm going to take a 3 month hiatus from this place and try Capital Seafood located in the Chinatown Plaza. AND yes I am aware of Hong Kong Garden's reputation. They've changed their name several times probably to avoid low star reviews, and moving onto a new yelp page...(Cathay House, Jade w/e, Hongkong etc etc) I wouldn't be surprised of the cooks are smoking while they make your food either lol",

We came close to midnight (they're open till 6am) but we felt so uncomfortable and so unwelcomed that we almost left. Service with NO smiles, the food and drinks were pretty much dropped on the table and they walked away.   They seemed to be inconvenienced when we asked for water.  And when half of our food was cold we sent it back and asked to cancel it but they brought it back out. When we declined it they walked away chatting in Chinese.     The food itself was nothing to be excited about. The house soup that they served, which is complimentary, looked and tasted like old soup that they didn't want to waste.  The pork spare ribs looked unappetizing.   Not to mention the tanks full of \"live\" seafood looked fine until you see the 2 dead fish floating. And the oral excrement left sitting in the bathroom sink didn't help with my already unsettled stomach.",

Food was ok at reasonable price ($25 before the tip), but there was not much dim sum to choose from (probably because it was a holiday?)  Spare ribs in black bean sauce (4/5): tasty, slightly spicy. Not much fat meat in spare ribs, which was good.  Chicken feet (4/5): well-cooked, great flavor with the sauce.  Fried taro dumpling (3.5/5): taste was good and was fried into nice shape, except that the dumpling was too large.  Tofu dessert (3.5/5): the syrup was too sweet, but overall it was good. Would be better if they offered brown sugar on it.   BBQ pork pastry (2.5/5): the pastry was too thick, so that I could barely taste the pork.  Shrimp paste stuffed peppers (2/5): again the whole thing was huge and not much flavor added.   Fried leek dumplings: I didn't try it, but my family did not seem to like it.  Seating was quite compact, but they still managed to leave out space for cart to go around lol. Overall the dim sum is of great value, the place is suitable for yum cha with family and friends, but I won't come for dim sum if I got other choices.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Hong Kong Garden. Visited about 1 o'clock on a Friday afternoon with a regular stream of dim sum carts passing by.  While not the size of a dim sum parlor in New York City San Francisco or even Hong Kong, there was a fine variety of offerings and a fairly full dining room made up of mostly Asians.  In the beginning I was asked if we wanted tea and I asked if they had jasmine or chrysanthemum available. \"Both\" was the answer and we enjoyed some lovely chrysanthemum tea along with with rock sugar to sweeten.  All the food was good and we particularly enjoyed dry sauteed shrimp, pan fried noodles, fish balls, shui mai,  shrimp wontons, steamed pork buns and especially the egg custard tarts at the end.  When I inquired about the tarts, one of the servers advised \"later\" and then grabbed a plate for us, still hot from the oven.  I can't think of a thing that wasn't a good experience there.",

Last night we went there with great expectation and.... the old owner sold the place. Now they cater to low cost chinese tourists apparently. I don't like the food anymore, and this make me sad. Service is still good, a bit rushed but the food is not for people that like good chinese food. I want to be clear, we went for dinner when Dim-Sum are not available. May be dim-sum are good but I will not try considering how bad as the dinner.",

SO UNPROFESSIONAL. anyways, i did restate when i was there and what i ordered per their request. didn't even bother to respond to my reply and it's been over a week. poor service matches the quality of the food.   definitely a disappointment, literally came here ready to eat decent dim sum at 5:00 AM. prices were pretty affordable however, when it came to the food it was basically edible food poisoning. The seafood in all the dishes we had made both me and my boyfriend's stomach curdle with its overpowering fishy taste (a sign of old seafood) the pork and chive dumpling had such a terrible mushy texture i couldn't even swallow. even the tea had a soapy taste but i tried to drink it anyways. also didn't even get water when we were served but we saw everyone else got some. I was very disappointed because the servers were very kind and it seemed promising however, will not be returning to avoid a sour stomach.",

The wontons, shumai (pork dumpling), and congee come in a close second. I don't think there is anything here I don't like besides personal preference. I also like their salt and pepper pork chops which you do have to order through the kitchen, are to die for!  The hargow (shrimp dumpling) tends to always break and that would be my only \"complaint\" if there's one to be had.

Had to flag someone down to order yang chow fried rice separately.  If you're looking for smiles and courteous service, this won't be the place for you.

The dim sum is $2.29 (S), $3.19 (M) and $3.39 (L).  They roll out the dim sum in carts, they come by and show you what is available.  Don't worry if you can't speak Cantonese, you just need to point to what you what.  For folks who are not familiar with dim sum, I suggest trying the steamed shrimp balls (har gau ) and beef balls ().  Avoid the chicken feet, could be too exotic for most folks.  The dry beef chow fun () for $7.95 has a great wok flavor, not too greasy, and a generous portion.  This like many of their other dishes are great values, it's hard to beat the quality and price.  This is my favorite dim sum restaurant in Vegas by far, would highly recommend.  There is a Yelp check in discount.",

So we said we'd drive up to Koreatown and go east towards Chinatown until something looked good. That's when we stopped at Hong Kong Garden.  Located on Spring Mountain Road, it's no more than 15 minutes from The Strip. When I tell you that we were well taken care of, that's an understatement.  For our appetizer, we enjoyed the spring rolls (very light!) and the soft shell crab. The crab was some of the very best I've ever experienced.  Then we had a very light vegetable soup, followed by scrambled eggs and prawns, along with sweet and sour whitefish. The eggs were very fluffy and seasoned to perfection, and the fish was expertly fried with just enough sauce to coat it, yet not too heavy.  For dessert we were brought a sweet red bean and tapioca soup. Looking at it you wouldn't think it would work...but it did! It was not too sweet, but sweet enough.  Generous portions and a relaxing atmosphere, it's worth driving across town or catching a rideshare from The Strip to enjoy! Needless to say, but we'll definitely return soon!",

As a Chinese/American who frequently eats at Dim Sum places in both China & America, I feel like I've been developing the ability to locate solid Dim Sum places.   The atmosphere feels very authentic. Everyone, when we went, were Chinese people and the workers were Chinese as well. And the food tasted super authentic as well.  My standard for comparing Dim Sum places is usually comparing their chicken feet dish, since it's my favorite. Now, I don't say this lightly, but this was the best chicken feet I've ever had, in both America and China. Yes, I know, a crazy statement that defies the logic of \"its so much better in China\" which is usually totally True.  The chicken feet is meaty, a bit spicy, and served hot.   So, in short, if you wanna enjoy some Dim Sum before hitting the casinos, come here. It'll be the least risky gamble you make in Vegas.",

The buns is a must, that egg tart more like egg heaven, and everything is just that good. Service is great too and they're so nice and friendly. If you're not already here eating while reading this review then you better put your phone down, drive over here and munch your heart away. Good vibes go there now :D  PS: it's open from 9am to 6am so those late night munchies heck yeah!",

    "text": "Our last meal in Las Vegas was dim sum, shared with Jean C.  She is such a fun, energetic person!  I was so happy for my friends to meet each other!  We selected this restaurant because it opened at 9am and we had to get to the airport by 11am... It's good to be early because we had our choice of free parking stalls! There was no line, so we were seated right away!   The steaming carts rolled past us and we chose all of the regular items: shrimp dumplings, siu mai, chicken feet, mochi rice wrapped in Lotus leaf, Chinese broccoli, jin dui, and char siu bao.  We asked for noodles, but there was no cook onsite, so we settled for jook (congee).    The Hom sui gok and Don tot took a while longer to come out of the kitchen.  The outer layer of the fried hom sui gok was on the thicker side - shucks. The middle of the don tat was mushy, but the crust had flakey layers of crispness!  Yum!  This is a typical dim sum restaurant with an adequate restroom and \"normal\" service. If you have limited time, this might be a good choice since it's quick. I still need to go to KJ's at the Rio...to compare...",

With this last trip, I was craving some onolicious dim sum...BADLY.  Hong Kong Garden Seafood answered the call.  The service is fast and they're very attentive to when the plates begin to look too clean.  We had the char siu bao, mochi rice in lotus leaf, fried taro dumplings, shrimp siu-mai, shrimp/chive dumpling, tofu skin roll, chicken feet (mmmm) and shrimp har-gau.  Needless to say that the 3 of us were stuffed...  Conveniently located right on Spring Mountain Road, there's lots of parking, a clean dining area and did I say excellent service?  This is not a high-end sort of restaurant, so the prices are very reasonable.  If you want to satiate your craving for some solid, traditional dim sum, I recommend Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum...",

For those like me that aren't able to speak chinese, there may be a chance that you'll have a tough time here and basically be ignored.  We got here right around lunch time on a Saturday and were seated quickly even though it was pretty packed.  First question from the young hostess was what kind of tea we'd like.  I asked her if they had black tea and she said she had no idea what black tea was...really?  She said they have oolong tea so that's what we ended up with.  First few minutes, the ladies rolling carts noticed we just arrived and had an empty table so the carts quickly came by and stopped to see if we were interested.  After about 4-5 cart visits, we had some pork shu mai, a char siu pork in sort of a pastry, some rice noodles with bbq beef, and some fishcake balls with chives in them.  These all were so-so, not good, not bad, but pretty much just OK.  I was really hoping for some xiao long bao and some char siu bao but no carts had any.  I asked one of the cart ladies if we could just order them but she said those would be coming around soon so we waited.   After about 10 minutes with the same carts with the same food going by we got the attention of one of the servers in black and tried to order them from her.  An attempt at a discussion went back and forth between us for a bit and it was finally revealed that she can't speak english so she gave up and walked away.  A few more minutes go by and all the same cart ladies with all the same food go back and forth by us and they know we're not interested in the food they have so they don't look our way.   Busboys scurry to and fro clearing plates and turning over tables.  Servers in black shuffle around the dining room bantering with diners lucky enough to speak the language. And we kind of just sat there feeling invisible for what was a good 20 minutes.  I see a guy who I think was the manager and ask for the check.  He notices we don't have too much to total up  and asks \"is this all you guys are having?\"  I answer back, \"yep, we're definitely done here\" and that was definitely the truth.  One thing to add, the table of four behind us was having the same problem as we were...difficulty communicating and no one coming by.  After a long time, one of them actually got up and chased down one of the speedy busboys that didn't already have his hands full so I know I'm not just being an overly picky diner.  I've had A LOT of dim sum in my time, some good and some not so good and sadly this place is at the bottom of the rung.  Dim sum that's just so-so but with some really bad service.",

Hong Kong Garden Seafood & Dim Sum Cafe was close to one of my favorite tea shops, so I decided to try it.   Hong Kong Garden was quite large and quite filled, so I knew that it was popular within the Chinese community. My friends and I were welcomed by the multitude of dim sum carts that frequently passed by our table. They had a large selection of dim sum choices, including shrimp rice rolls and custard buns. The service was fast, and the food was delightful. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to try a new dim sum place in Las Vegas.",

Both of us were stuffed and had leftovers to go for around $30, so not ridiculous in price, either! My husband asked me to bookmark this place for our next Vegas trip, so good time had by all.

    "text": "I've come here a total of three times and each time gets worse and worse. I was here on a Saturday afternoon around 1pm. It was super busy. There wasn't a very long wait, which I was surprised at first. However, after realizing how closely they pack all the tables together I wasn't surprised anymore. We got seated in the dining area to the right of the restaurant. I was really disgusted at how unsanitary the bathroom was. There were two stalls and I took the smaller one of the two. There was a small trash can next to the toilet that was overflowing with toilet paper and tissues. I went to wash my hands and one of the women who worked there came out after me and finished washing her hands before me- it makes me question if she even used soap. Then, to top it off, they had no paper towels.   The food was alright. It's your typical dishes and nothing special. The lady pushing around the cart with the fried shrimp came back to give me a fresh batch, which was nice. Service wasn't spectacular. I asked one lady for a fork and a couple of sodas, and she didn't quite understand me and went to grab another lady. Apparently I was tending to my son and my back was to her, so I had to wave her down again.   The price is a little cheaper than other places, but you're paying for quality. I'd rather pay a little more for a better quality restaurant.",

This used to be Cathay House, it's now Hong King Garden so we decided to try. Got a large table immediately, as the hostess sat us she was arguing with a co-worker! They were literally standing where I sat and yelled at each other.   We got our food before your drinks, terrible service which is typical of most Dim Sum places. Serve the same type of food, nothing unique from other places. I did not pay so can't tell you if it is cheaper or more expensive than other places.   Food was decent, not disappointing but not impressed either. Service was terrible, I did not expect great service but at least don't be yelling at each other while seating the guests!!",

The only nice staff member was this young man who felt bad and at an hour and a half later he brought us rice while we waited. Whomever the owners are I saw your reviews from the year before on Christmas and it was just as bad. People walked out on Christmas last year and we saw at least 3 tables get up last night too after hours of not being served. At least go to your tables and apologize for it and not ignore your customers.",

    "text": "We came here because of a dim sum craving awe got to our favorite spot l, ping pang pong, too late to get dim sum. What a terrible mistake coming to this place was. Now for those new to Las Vegas, this is the old Cathay House, home to the best dim sum in Vegas for probably around 20 years.   The dim sum here is below average at best. Sugar cane shrimp was super greasy smelling of old oil, siu mai had a freezer taste to it, the fun noodles are supposed to be super slippery and tender, but these had a store bought thickness or toughness to it. The chicken feet were decent though.   We were totally dissatisfied with the dim sum, but we weren't full yet so we decided to order off the menu. The snow pea leaves we're actually very good, so we thought to try the geoduck sashimi soup combo. They brought out a dead looking 5 pound geoduck at $55 a pound... So I got up to inspect the live tanks and man oh man.. all the seafood looked dead, not a single thing was moving(see the video) So we immediately cancelled that order. Then we ordered a braised bird's nest soup at $31 a bowl, which isn't a bad price... But when there are no traces of the bird nest strings in the soup and they just tried to mask it by mixing in a ton of corn starch to thicken the soup so you can't tell, I'm gonna be upset.  The service here is bad. \"Thank you's\" were not met with \"you're welcome's\". Napkin requests were not acknowledged, they kinda just showed back up a few minutes later and slammed them on the table. It was bad.   From the lackluster food to the abysmal service, this was without a doubt, one of the worst experiences I've had in this city.",

Dim sum was good, they don't have exotic items but do have normal dim sum like shrimp dumplings, pork shumai, chicken feet, pork spareribs, etc. It wasn't as fresh as it could be since it had been in the carts (the skins on the dumplings were a bit rough) but the taste was ok.",

Well OK, not that extreme, but our visit to Vegas was past the mid-night point and waiting at a casino bar hoping to get served right away was getting impossible. So we looked up the nearest Chinese restaurant by us that's still open and ever so grateful for Yelp, we found this one!  My carnivorous friends and vegetarian bestie both raved the dishes they had (pork belly and buddha's delight, respectively). While I quietly but quickly devoured my Conch with Yellow Chives. Oh, Yellow Chives, they were so tender and fragrant, really elevate any seafood dishes! The only setback was the Conch was a bit too chewy, almost like dried, preserved seafood kind of texture...  There were quite a few tables of non-gambling ('cause why else would they be here this time of day!) Chinese just eating, shooting the breeze and having a good time. Made it really feel like an authentic Chinese restaurant. Did I say I appreciated their hours of operation? Yeah, I think they stay open for 20 hours of the day!",

Another with veggies.  Some chicken. Some pork. A taro one and more.  Anyway we tried a wide variety of dimsums from the cart. And Chinese brocalli.   The brocalli was the best part of the meal. The dumplings all fell short. Some had barely any fillings, others tasted stale.  Tea was okay hard to mess that up.  Service was okay at first. 1 cart lady came to us twice. The other passed by 4 times before we found a waitress and ask her to send us the cart lady.  We were unable to order anything from dim sum the menu. Because they were put of the things we tried to order. But we were okay with cart only dim sum. It was underwhelming because of sparse fillings and stale dumplings.   Anyway. I don't recommend this place. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Prologue: It was lunch time on a Monday and my fiancee and I were in the mood for some good Chinese food to satisfy our craving. A previous online search of restaurants in the vicinity of Chinatown yielded this result along with several good reviews.  The Plot: This restaurant offers dim sum every day and it had been awhile since we'd had dim sum so we decided to do that. Our selections included a good assortment of traditional steamed items as well as pastry.  The Scene: We felt reassured about our decision to try this restaurant when, upon arrival, we discovered that nearly one hundred percent of the patrons were Asian, most of whom were probably locals.  All of our selections were as good as they should be to satisfy any fan of dim sum.  The highlights for us were the Braised Beef Tendon, which just melted in my mouth, and the Pork Ribs, which were extra meaty and steamed with a few small pieces of pumpkin that enhanced the flavor wonderfully.  The Egg Yolk Buns were soft, warm, with melted yellow custard inside, and were also very yummy. My fiancee requested two extra orders to take home.  The Rest of the Story: Our only minor disappointment was that the dim sum menu did not include any items that were different or unique. However, we were there on a Monday and it is likely that their weekend menu has more variety.  The service was prompt, not too pushy, and the prices were average.  Epilogue: I expect we will return on one of our future trips to Las Vegas so we can try their dim sum on a weekend.  Photo Design By: Billie Z.",

The dining area is not as big as the dim sum places I'm used to in the 626 area but it was still pretty crowded at Hong Kong Garden. The pros (or maybe cons) of having a small dining space is that the dim sum carts gets to you a lot faster. I wasn't used to the dim sum cart speed over here but we managed to get what we needed in the first 10 minutes of dining.   The staff was nice and was on top of everything, but the dim sum here is just average. It's nothing special, but it wasn't bad. It'll satisfy your dim sum craving but that's it. I don't know if there is any other dim sum spots in Vegas, but if there isn't any, this spot would do just fine.",

Wide selection of hot and fresh dim sum, desserts brought around the room on carts. Absolutely delicious and tasty!!! The price is reasonable compare to other dim sum restaurants in town. Weekends usually get pretty busy but the wait is never too long. The only problem is hard to get the server around the table. They tend to forget easily after they talk to me or mostly it takes a while for them to get back to my table. I totally understand how busy they are but it would be nice if they could pay more attention to their customers. Anyway...it doesn't really bother me at all because their food is always amazing, never get disappointed when I eat there. Definitely recommend it!!!!!",

    "text": "My favorite dim sum place in Vegas, thus far. I came here back in the early 2000's. It looked a little different and I still remember this old couple arguing about the lobster being a male or a female. I also spilled hot tea all over my lap.  If you don't know what dim sum is, think of it kind of like tapas. Small portions with the intent to share and have a variety to create your own meal. Have (and spend) as much or as little as you want. Order the same thing 4 times if you wish. But the variety is what makes it a thing of beauty.   It's affordable without sacrificing quality or quantity. It's comfortable even though it's a pretty large space with two separate rooms. I've come for dinner and for lunch. It seems like both rooms are only open for lunch and the dim sum carts. Dinner service is in the main room with no carts. I'm not super well versed in etiquette so I don't know if this is expected, but I thought it worth mentioning because I was still expecting the carts at dinner and all we received were separate menus.   The carts are filled with such a lovely variety of dishes! Congee, bao, shaomai, lotus leaf wraps, veggies, desserts of all different kinds. You can also place orders for different BBQ pork, duck and other kitchen items. A few of my favorites are the lotus leaf wraps, the shaomai, duck and egg tarts. I have never had a more delicious egg tart. It's so flaky! The custard is a sweet, creamy consistency. It's perfect. I love the egg tart here more than anywhere else in Vegas.  I prefer to go at lunch time because I feel that the carts are more convenient. I love that tea is served in pots instead of by the cup. It's so busy at all times of operating hours, which I like, because I don't feel like I'm being gawked at. That being said, service is still attentive.   Parking can be a bit of a pain because this plaza is poppin' so don't get discouraged if you can't immediately find a spot.",

    "text": "This is one of my aunt's favorite places in Vegas to grab dim sum, and when compared to the other local dim sum joints in the area, I can see why. This place is open from 9 AM to 6 AM - almost 24 hours, and the restaurant is pretty big. It does get busy on weekends, but with people coming and going so often, you won't have to wait too long.   They still have the traditional cart wheeling dim sum, which I appreciate. I've never seen them run out of items, and if they don't have a specific item just yet, they'll be able to get it for you in a few minutes.   The standard dim sum items have always been pretty good - radish cakes, chicken feet, siu mai, etc. I don't think they have the egg yolk buns here, which is a little disappointing; however, their egg tarts are pretty delicious - flaky crust and very ooey and soft center.   I've also been able to try some of their other dishes like the Singapore style noodle, broken rice soup, etc. All have been really tasty and at a pretty affordable price.   The interior of the place isn't the newest or cleanest, but you're basically getting an above average dim sum meal in Las Vegas. I would have to say that the dim sum here does not compare to the SGV area, but you make do with what you have.   Workers are friendly and will help you whenever you let them know you need something. They offer a Yelp check-in, which is pretty nice. Parking lot can get crowded as it's in a busy plaza, but so far we haven't had trouble parking.   tl;dr - Above average dim sum at an affordable price. Hours are very good and service is above average.",

    "text": "I've never been to other dim sum places in Las Vegas Chinatown...so I can only compare to what I've eaten before.   I came here with a party of 7 on a Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 pm. I had called earlier to make sure they still served dim sum and they also took my reservation!   We came at 12:15 pm and they were in a scurry to clean our table and seat is. Okay, that's fine. But the whole point of \"\" is to drink tea along with your food! We didn't get any service for tea 20 minutes into dining even though the cart ladies were already bombarding us with options.   We ordered quite a bit!  -Fung Zhao (chicken feet) // classic dish. Pretty sweet, not spicy enough. But not bad for what they had!   -Har gau (steamed shrimp dumpling) // Okay, this was butchered. Not so crystal skin and it was cold and falling apart.   -Siu Mai (open topped steamed pork or shrimp dumplings) // a bit too oily for the pork! But still yummy. *Be warned, we found a piece of hair in this. Luckily we could exchange it...*  -Jiu Cai Bau (fried wheat starch skin dumpling with chives) // yum! I would get again. It was a bit on the oily side but stuffed with good amount of meat and thin skin.   -Cha Siu Bao (steamed BBQ pork stuffed buns) // Mehhh. I'm not a huge fan of this item regardless of where I get it.   -Cheong Fan (rolled rice noodles) // errrr. Probably one of the worst I've had. Not big and soft like other places! This was tiny and stale....too much soy sauce added and really cold! The beef one was gross, shrimp was doable. Luckily we didn't order too many!   -Pei Guen (steamed tofu skin roll) // Classic dish that I love! They did okay with this- you seriously can screw up steaming this. But the only complaint I have is that the stuffing inside was way too little and did not have the classic bamboo shoots.   -Lo Mai Gai (steamed glutinous rice) // Not flavorful at all, and barely half a teaspoon of stuffing in the center. Regret!   -Daan taat (egg custard tart) // This was a disappointment (like everything else). But I guess it's good for the kiddos!   -bowl of intestine soup // too sweet, but I love intestines regardless.   -bowl of pig blood soup // not a super clean taste- can still taste some of the \"freshness\". Good portion though!   -plate of stir fried beef and rice noodles // Good! Pretty decent potion, not too oily and enough beef for everyone.   Pros:  -Helpful service. They were patient and helpful with out questions and needs.  -cheap? I would say for 8 people, we only paid $85 before tax.   Cons:  -Not a lot of options rolling around. And I mean, literally, rolling around. The classic Cheong fan wasn't being served unless you requested it!  -No menus. It's nearing lunch time and I would think that you'd give us a lung menu too since the cart ladies were taking off! You'd have to be a frequent here to be able to understand what they are doing...  Tips/Observations:  -parking lot is small! Be prepared to circle around.   Overall, never again....I would check out other places besides here.",

Everything was great!   However, The restaurant is so unsanitary. Especially the restrooms. I saw toilet tissue all over the floor, mold on the sink, no paper towels, hand soap stains in the sink. It was filthy! Before looking at the bathroom, I felt a little iffy so I didn't even want to drink out of their cups and wanted to buy a fresh bottle of water instead. I hope the new owners know that this could ruin their business reputation. I don't know about you but I like to eat in a spotless clean, sanitary restaurant.. I really do enjoy eating here, but I just don't think I can handle knowing the restaurant's employees are filthy and dirty :(",

Once walking through the doors I smelled the wreaking of a wet mop slapping me in the face. Very sour and pungent smell and lurks around. Everything else around wasn't opened till later so I still decided to sit down and eat. The tea we ordered wasn't even hot, Luke warm at its best.  Once ordering a few dishes I was just making sure this dish I ordered was warm, the waitress comments back saying \"then don't eat it if it isn't warm\" this got me furious. Just a simple question making sure the dish I wanted was warm but she decided to be very rude. Probably won't be coming back here or suggesting a place like this to people I call friends or family.   The waitress also brings the food to the table and after setting it down she decides to wipe down her hands on the table cloth that we were eating at.",

We waited 20 minutes before we were acknowledged and given menus since we did not want the Dim Sum option. The fire emergency exist was deadbolted shut and stacks of chairs and high chairs crammed in front of it.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were annoying and kept circling and grunting if we wanted whatever unidentifiable item was on their cart. Also English is not the first second or third language used here.  After ordering they brought  our entrees separately 15 minutes apart! No fortune cookie.  Also this in an authentic Chinese restaurant so some of the menu items are interesting to say the least. Now the good.  The portions were large and the food was good.",

Now the service was just horrible. I've given them a two star review before for the same reason. But back then I thought just maybe we should give them another try. When we did ended up coming back, the service had changed. Their customer service was back on point. But after our show tonight we decided we wanted some Chinese food and  decided on here.  The staff looked tired and agitated. No greeting, no smile. When we ordered our food, the waitress seemed unhappy. We had to ask a waitress twice for my husband's drink.

The salt and pepper calamari is my favorite dish - nicely cooked and season - eat it while it's hot!  The Peking Duck is presented nicely on steamed buns and the rest of the duck is served on a platter.  Spare ribs, pan fried noodles, and broccoli oh yes!  The broccoli has a nice crunch to it and the black bean sauce on the ribs is outstanding, not too salty.  My Pops always orders the sweet and sour pork, and I have to give him props for actually trying the other dishes this time.  Way to go Pops!    The Tsing Tao and Sapporo is icy cold and served in chilled glasses.  Why only four stars?  The bathroom.  I can't wait for the new location to open because the bathroom was bad.  Yuck.

    "text": "AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!!  Made reservations for 13 for dinner and was seated in the private \"VIP\" room but everything about the meal here was far from that experience...  Waiters didn't know anything about the menu and dishes at this restaurant. My family asked about the fresh/live seafood selection but all questions went completely over their heads. The wait staff made zero effort to serve us other than dropping off the dishes. They even left a thermos of hot water for us to refill tea ourselves. When time came for the check, we had to go outside to flag down a waiter and bring the check/payment to the front desk. The hostess at the front desk didn't talk or even make eye contact when ringing me up; no \"thank you\" nada. We just spent more than $500 dollars on this terrible dinner with no service at all...  The service MIGHT be tolerable if the food was delicious BUT IT MOST CERTAINLY WAS NOT!! Either no salt/flavor or too heavy handed with some dishes. The quality of their \"live\" seafood is also unacceptable for the price in addition to the way they prepared the dishes completely ruined the sub-par fish quality. Some dishes were just thrown together with all the vegetables they found in the kitchen to mask their complete lack of understanding for that particular dish; just random pops of colored veggies to \"brighten up\" the dish, no cohesive taste or reason for the selections. Other dishes were completely forgotten, even when the waiters repeated our large order several times to us.   Save yourself the trip and eat something else, anything else in Vegas Chinatown. It will be probably be a better meal...",

We over partied and decided to stay in, so around 11 we were famished and saw that there was a china town near by. So needless to say we headed over. We saw that Hong Kong Garden had a wild verity of dim sum, soups, noodles and rice which was the perfect heavy hang over remedy.   It does a while for the waitresses to help you out but I guess you can use that time to go over the menu. I was dying for egg drop soup so we got an order that was def more than enough for two, we actually took a large container back with us because there was so much left over. We also ordered some Shrimp har gow, a few order and some sweet shrimp.  While we waited for everything to come out we were handed some yummy green tea to sip on. About half way into the first cup of tea the egg drop soup was dropped off. We dove it, it was good, eggy and just as it should taste. Again very soon after the shrimp har gow was dropped off. It was so delicious I loved it so much, I added some chili and soy sauce to make it a little spicy. YUM.   But the def go to for the night was the sweet shrimp. It is minced shrimp rolled into a ball and fried with a piece of sugar cane. It was so savory, sweet and crispy. I loved it!! Over all I was very happy with Hong Kong Garden, i know i will def be back when i visit Vegas.",

    "text": "I came here for Dim Sum with family members Sunday morning at around 11:00 A.M PST. It's pretty easy to get to, towards Spring Mountain and Jones, about 10 minutes from the Strip.  The place was packed! The whole front entry had people standing inside and you could barely move around.  Our party, since it was relatively large, had the private room inside the restaurant. Because the private room is separate from the main restaurant, the carts do not come by the private room. You have to pre-order off of the menu.   The food came out quick and everything was hot. We had a variety of foods, Hong Kong Chow Mein, Jian Dui, Char Sui Bao, White Rice, Bok Choy, and Fried Tofu. I ended up just eating the Jian Dui, but my daughter loved the Bok Choy and the Hong Kong Chow Mein! We didn't receive much service outside of the initial plating of the food. Our party had to ask for waters, and when we finally received it, we waited about 10 minutes or so for the drinks to come out. During the Dim Sum, we never had any refills on the water. Service was sub-par.  The women's bathrooms when I came here on Sunday were atrocious. It was quite the experience.The trash was over-flowing in the stall. The toilets were dirty. The sinks were rusted and not properly working. It was very unsanitary.   Overall this is a decent Dim Sum place, but I won't be back here anytime soon. I'll check out some other Dim Sum places in Las Vegas.",

They have a lot of seating but can get crowded in the morning with a bit of a wait time (~ 30 mins). They push carts (until 3pm) filled with all sort of dishes that you can choose from. It's definitely an experience you must try. You can still order other non dim sum dishes as well. It's better to come as a large group so you can have more of a variety to eat but nothing wrong if it's just you and another person.",

Only a few miles away from the strip which is a plus and lots of parking too. Clearly this is a popular restaurant because people kept coming in.   When you walk in someone will greet you and take you to a seat. Left side has a view with large windows and the right side is just regular looking dining room.  Push carts going by fast and keep in mind some do not speak English.  Great selections for Dim Sum.  Although service was fast, my shumai was cold.  I get it that they push the cart around and it can get cold but that was my only disappointment.  I still ate it.  Prices are reasonable and not overly priced.   I will definitely return and recommend this place.",

Please don't go here you guys!!   A party of 5 of us came around 1AM and were the only ones in the restaurant. There were 2 servers who were eating their meal at the table behind us and when 1 of them came to take our order, she was still chewing her food! We ordered wonton soup, chow fun, fried rice, and fried tofu. The food came out and this is when it went all bad...  Our wonton soup came out and my bf noticed 2 black bugs floating around in it. We told the server right away and she offered to make us a new one. Next came the chow fun and this one was the worst - there were little bugs all over it! We counted AT LEAST five and that's just on the surface! The server finally came back with the new wonton soup and when we told her there were bugs in our chow fun she rolled her eyes! THEN she continued to deny that they were bugs and said it came from the meat.. gross. She started getting extremely defensive and making excuses for why there are bugs in their food. The replacement wonton soup that came out ended up having more bugs floating in it as well. Imagine the bug infestation in that kitchen!!   We knew they were bugs because they had little legs and little wings. They didn't even apologize. In fact, they took the wonton soup and chow fun and put it on their table and ate it. If they want to eat bugs, cool!! But don't serve it to your customers. Smh. NEVER COMING BACK!",

She is the thin woman with a ponytail and wears all black.  A few weeks ago, I ordered chat leong, but the waitress brought over jasmine tea. Also, there were only two of us, but she gave us two tea pots. That was really weird.  The following Wednesday morning around 9:20 am, we got the same waitress again. I was with my father, and I had wanted to order chat leong, but I did not because of what happened last time. Chat Leong was my dad's favorite, but I was afraid the waitress would mess it up again.  I can only come on Wednesdays, and everytime I come to the restaurant I see that same waitress again. If you want me and my family to come back, GET RID OF THAT THIN WAITRESS. She does not know what she is doing. She never understands what I am asking! If you want to keep the waitress, then I will never come back.  I am tired of asking for a different waiter or waitress everytime I eat here.",

    "text": "We were on this side of town and had some time to kill, so what better way than to order some dim sum to go? Parking lot is tiny and it seems like nearly every space is labeled for which business you can park in, but we found a spot. Packed at 9:40 AM on a Wednesday.  It was pretty crowded inside and even while we were waiting, nearly 15 people came in. Their hours said 9AM to an adjusted 6AM so they must have steady business. I wish they had a menu that had pictures to make sure I got exactly what I wanted; just a title of the food without a description and a S M L next to it which seemed to coincide with a price. Ended up getting: hargow, shumai, shrimp rice noodle, Chinese sausage bun, fried potstickers, and an order of gailan (Chinese broccoli). Total came to about $25. We waited in the corner on some chairs surrounded by old stereo equipment and signs. We might as well have been put in a closet . It took about 15 minutes for our food to be ready; they placed it on the divider wall behind us and never said anything. At one point I noticed it and stood up and had to ask if that was ours. So customer service isn't the best but prices were reasonable; now let's look at flavor. I really enjoyed my dim sum from here. It was packed with flavor and still tasted fresh even after the 30 minute trek home. The rice noodle and gailan both came with sauces which was nice. I was very happy with the portion size of the gailan which was a large size to go box, rather than the smaller ones. All in all I would go back the next time I'm in the area!",

I'm glad the new owners still make this an easy place to get dim sum during the work week lunch and that's the standpoint I'll be reviewing from.  HK Service:  There's plenty of tables in the main dining room as well as the banquet room which they open up for additional seating when necessary.  The staff gets you seated immediately after you enter.  The Dim Sum carts are stocked well and the crew moves quickly hrough the restaurant.  If you were looking for something in particular, just wave one a cart down and they'd find the right cart to send over.  Classic old school Chinese restaurant decor is what you'll find here with a nice view of the Strip in the main dining room.  HK Dim Sum:  They have the classics and all the dishes I've had have been freshly made and pretty tasty overall.  Here are my \"go to\" for business lunch Dim Sum meetings: Pork Bun, Shumai, Shrimp Rice Noodle, Shrimp Dumplings, Chinese Broccoli (to feel healthy af), Crispy Shrimp (with sweet mayo) and noodles for the side.  Dessert orders:  The Sesame balls and the egg custard are my favorites.     Even during a weekday lunch rush, I'm able to get parties of 6+ seated immediately and the table full of yummy dim sum dishes quickly.  This is the main reason why I visit frequently when the topic of dim sum come up at work.  Enjoy! =)",

    "text": "Was craving dim sum for lunch so my mom and I decided to give this place a try. We came on a busy Friday afternoon so parking was very difficult to find.   Surprisingly, we had no wait and were seated right away. They're constantly pushing the carts around so you don't really have to wait long to order what you want.  My go to dim dum choices are: tripe, chicken feet, shrimp rice noodle, shrimp dumplings and shiu mai. I order at least two of each because they're SOOOO good.   Although the food was really good and service was great, I couldn't rate this place a full 5 stars because the shrimp dumplings were way overcooked because it was very dry. I couldn't even chew it because it felt like rubber. I had to throw away most of the shrimp dumplings because of that.   Overall, I really liked this place. Great atmosphere and the food was good (despite the shrimp dumpling issue) haha.",

My nieces has a craving for Dim Sum and wanted to try this place out. Upon walking in you see a lot of server pushing carts with several food options. It's a little difficult when the server doesn't speak English very well and you can't really understand what that are offering .   My sister and I decided to order off the a menu, we kept asking the ladies who would push the carts if we could get menus and it felt like they were just brushing us off, like one lady would tell they other on in their language and then she would tell someone else and our request was just being bumped around.   We finally got our menus and ordered off them. Within 15 min, I got sick, I had to excuse myself to rush over to the ladies room and it all quickly came up! Luckily when I returned, most of our party had finished eating and I didn't have to wait long to leave.   I HIGHLY doubt that I will ever come back to this spot again. Luckily the rest of my family, said their food was okay, they would rate is as a 6 1/2 out of 10.",

    "text": "YEEEEESSSS! I think we found ourselves a new dim sum place. ONLY downside is - the carts take a break lol.  If I'm not mistaken, the dim sum carts are available between 9am-3pm and then are not available until 9pm-3am (or was it 6am). Between the hours of 3pm-9pm, I am told that dim sum items are still available for order off the menu.  The carts are more fun in my opinion.  We used to frequent another establishment because we thought we finally narrowed it down to one of the best in last vegas. BUT, I think we stand corrected.   When we were here, we just felt like we were more welcomed. The people who worked there were so patient and kind to explain over and over what I didn't understand. And the ones we normally order from other places, we found had better quality here. Like the shrimp ball and shrimp har gow. I was really excited when I ordered the Chinese broccoli and they cut it in half! Made it easier for me to eat the stems and leave the tops for my hubs. The noodles on the dim sum tray was also a good size and was soft and delicious. Other places I've ordered it were crunchy. This was enjoyable and not greasy.  It seemed we were brought into a private room that was opened up to accommodate additional parties that had come to dine for lunch so I inquired about it with our server. The private room we were in could accommodate about 120 people. And when I inquired if they allow for reservations for smaller parties, he told me there were other rooms also available that can accommodate smaller parties as well. He was so kind as to show us. One room was small enough to accommodate 12-16. Another room could accommodate 36-40.   We got excited! It is definitely one we could consider if we have family in town.  On top of dim sum, they also have a full menu of Chinese food.  We will definitely be back for more!",

    "text": "I must say, there is a lot of potential here.  I love me some old school dim sum with the carts being pushed around by the ladies.    The decor, simple, fresh and clean without any clutter on the walls.  The cleanliness of the place including the tea pots (though mismatched) offers a sense of hope that my food will be wonderful.  The price point is just right, not too cheap and for pretty decent quality.  We didn't get charged for water or tea, so that was really cool.  I'm used to paying per person for tea in California.  If I had to nit-pick, the food is not covered. They walk around with the food completely exposed and the chances of the top ones getting cold by the time it reaches my table was pretty high. The likelihood of germs getting on them was pretty high too. It's a little cumbersome to lift all the covers, but it's all part of the cart process.  Am I the only one who got cold food even during peak lunch hour on a Monday?  That was a big factor for my 3 stars.   Har gow- the dough was ripping off exposing the shrimp, had a really doughy taste so we'll have to pass next time.  Not my favorite dish to order and that fact it wasn't good made it worse.  Siu mai- Just like what it should taste like, meaty and never salty.   Cheong fun- My husband enjoyed it, by the time I got to the last one, it was a folded too thick and the meat (never in abundance) was not quite the right ratio.  Char siu bao- The dough again for me wasn't on par.  It wasn't terrible, but the mixture of the red char siu is a mixture of sweet and salty and just ends my meal on a good note.  Chicken feet- oh yeah!! Not only it's considered a small dish price, it was delicious with the right amount of spice and the ooey gooey sauce that is lathered all over 4-5 pieces of this tender dish.  Bean curd vegetarian- Usually an awesome dish. A mixture of vegetables, water chestnuts and beautifully folded in bean curd. My lady gave me the top one and that is what left me with a sour note to my review.  I hate luke warm dim sum. Since I didn't have time to complain, I'll have to ask for a warmer batch next time.",

My top dishes that I would eat again (and in fact, ate again) were the egg tarts(the second best egg tarts I've had), the broccoli, the shrimp hargow, and the tofu(without the sugar). I also enjoyed the experience of people pushing around carts and letting us choose what we wanted. The environment was a little crowded in my opinion. The reason I rate this restaurant a three is because those four dishes, out of EVERYTHING my friends and I ordered, were the only dishes I generally liked. Hope this helped!",

Don't let the hole-in-the-wall appearance fool you, the service is good and the food even better.  Prices were very reasonable with our party of 10 easily accommodated, portion sizes of all dishes were decent and our bill landing just shy of $100USD.  They treat you to a house soup to start, which is a \"soup of the day\" bone broth. Food came out hot and fresh and flavored well.  We had seafood dishes which included clams, scallops, shrimp all were fresh (the have live tanks displaying some fish and lobster as well).  After the meal, there was a dessert soup offered.   All in all if you're looking for a great meal out without breaking the bank in Vegas, this is a great choice!   *their hours of operation are great opening 9am to 6am daily; lots of parking;  ***lots of locals eating there**",

It is True that while this may not be the best dim sum in the world, it is pretty darn good for what you get in Las Vegas.  Quick too, if you want to avoid long waits, this is the spot.  We went during the lunch hour on Sunday (prime time) and were seated in less than 5 minutes.  In less than ten minutes after that, we had food on the table.  Everything came out hot and fresh, and I'm so glad it reopened after having been closed for a while.

However, walking in on a weekday (Tuesday) at 11:30am, the place was packed. But more importantly, packed with native Chinese speakers. That's a very very good sign. The authenticity was on point, and the service was very courteous and fast. Carts came around very often, and we got terrific service even though they were packed.   The parking situation in front is troublesome, but after talking to the employees we learned that there was parking in the back. If you're craving dim sum in Las Vegas, this is the place to go!",

They were a little pushy with the food though. Like they would literally put food on your table when you didnt request for it. They were cool about it if we did decline.  If we wanted something that wasnt in the cart because it was all gone, they made sure that more was on the way. My favorite dim sum dishes was the sui mai, and the garlicky broccoli.  Really every thing was fresh and good. Place is small, I think there was like only 15 tables in the room we were in. I cant imagine going here on a weekend like it be mad busy. Also the parking lot is small. I think I would be stress out looking for a parking spot when eating here. This place hit the spot and definitely my go too place for dim sum when in vegas.",

We used to come here when it was the Cathay House and decided to come back.  The member of our group who is going to Taiwan stopped in the week before and reserved the private room for us.  The place has been renovated a bit with the main part of the restaurant now all on one floor.  Opposite the entrance and down a few steps is the private room with its large, round table with lazy Susan for easy sharing.  One problem with the room though is the carts have no way of coming down the steps to the room so you order what you want but you can't see it like we used to as the carts are wheeled around.  A few times one of the women brought a dish to the room to see if we wanted but for the most part, our Asian friend ordered for us.  We got the standard pork shumai, steamed pork buns, sesame balls, and rice noodle rolls.  In addition, there was an order for Singapore noodles and chow fun.  The Singapore noodles were quite good with a good amount of curry.  The food was OK for our lunch.  Service was good but we needed to ask for water which came as we were nearing the end of our meal.  I like the restaurant and it was almost filled.  I'm sure we'll be back another time to enjoy lunch.",

No manager or owner in the restaurant. Waitress said the manager doesn't come in until the afternoon and there's no one in charge.  She also said that it's a constant issue (filthy dishes) and management is aware. Then the waitress shrugs like it's a normal occurrence, that this happens all the time.   She even said the manager won't say anything new but that their sorry. Don't bother coming to this restaurant the dim sum isn't even all that great to jeopardize your health.",

I was salivating watching the carts pass me by as dim sum would be my death row last supper. I've had it all over the world and in my opinion Hong Kong and Vancouver have the absolute best. When he finally arrived we order items 107 steamed shrimp & pork dumplings, 108 shrimp har gow, 109 steamed chicken feet w/black bean sauce. It was honestly disgusting and frigid. I took a bite and literally spat it out. The inside of the shumai was still pink and the typical hot juicy clear liquids bursting with flavor was no where to be found. Not only did these 3 items sit at the table for our entire meal without anyone acknowledging it (even as we pointed out how there was no steam and they were cold to the touch to multiple cart ladies), they had the audacity to send out the manager to argue with us and say the only reason it was cold was because we let it sit there the whole meal! I was so appalled that I wanted it thrown away and she insists she wants to make us another batch. Uhm suck it. They refused to take it off our check even then! I had to stop the check before the cashier tallied it up. It was THE worst dim sum experience I've ever had and I've had Michelin Star down to the hole in the walls in Kowloon.",

The 4 stars are based solely on the food experience.  The pork shumai was great as well as the sticky rice in banana leaves.  Highly recommend the hum bao.  The \"scallop\" dumplings, ended up being  shrimp so that was a little bit of a let down, but still tasted delicious.  We (a party of 4) were there on a Sunday for lunch and though crowded, was seated right away.  One thing to keep in mind, that we experienced, was that it was either all the carts show up to your table at the same time or no carts stop by your table.  There was no in-between.   Over all, I would recommend this restaurant.",

The food is above average and its a hit and miss at times but pretty consistent. They expanded the restaurant in area by opening up a section on the side which I dont recommend due to lack of ventilation. The temperature between the two dining room is about 5 degrees difference. I would ask to wait until seats open up in the main dining area if Im told only seating is the new expansion area. The food cart doesnt come around as often since its makes its turn in the main dining room first and then heads into the new area on the side. The wine and liquor selection have significantly expanded its inventory by added a dozen California reds, Moutai and some premium selection of liquor. Since the Dim Sum portions are not as large as in other cities, you are able to taste more items. Few items are not always available for some reason such as Chives dumpling or Shark fin dumpling and the flavors of your standard items are not consistent.",

So we just pointed to what we wanted but she brushed our hands away from her cart. We had to wait for her to finish the conversation. So the 4 stars is for the food & other employees. Zero stars to the cart lady.",

The dim sum carts were OK..choices were OK. Pretty standard. Nothing stood out that I would need to come back for.  The table of 2 next to us, got up and stomped out of the restaurant because they only got one dish in the 20 minutes they sat down. Apparently, not enough food choices and the restaurant didn't seem to care.   Will continue to look for a decent dim sum place in Vegas the next time I'm there.",

I ordered Hot &  Sour Soup and Kung Pao Shrimp.  The soup is only served in large bowls as they do not have individual (small) bowls.  The soup was okay, but I have had better and as for my tastes, I probably wouldn't order it again.  (I am very picky about Hot & Sour Soup)  The Kung Pao Shrimp was good and I asked for extra spicy and only got average.  This seems to happen a lot to me and I find it strange that I ask for extra spicy and seem to only get mediocre spicy.  The  wait staff was polite, courteous, and seemed to be overworked and they were constantly being talked to in Chinese Loudly.  They did not seem happy to be talked to in that manner and I found it to be unsettling but it didn't seem to bother customers.  The loud instructions to wait staff was not helpful in having a relaxing meal and it gave a rushed, chaotic atmosphere.  Again, the customers were engaged in conversation and seemed to pay no notice to the loud instructions. This was my only experience at Hong Kong Garden and I would return to try other dishes.  I would recommend trying this place as long as you were prepared for a similar experience.",

    "text": "So I haven't had dim sum in a while and the only place I had tried in Vegas prior to HK was Ping Pang Pong, which was as far as I can remember, decent but nothing extremely WOW. I'm no super expert on dim sum but being from the Bay Area and eating at many of the places there like Yank Sing, I'd like to think I know at least a bit.  First of all, I'm used to there being a wait. I don't know why but no matter what place you went to in the Bay Area, there was ALWAYS a line. Especially on Sunday. The place was fairly full but thankfully there was a table open for myself and 2 others ready to go! Just be aware that the girl behind the front counter is more there to ring you out at the end of the meal than to greet/seat you. We waited for a few beats before someone came and got us.  Service was good, the carts stopped often, gracefully passed us when it looked like our table was pretty full already, stopped when we asked and we had people clearing plates/filling drinks/asking if things were okay. Our drink orders were taken as soon as we sat down and came out promptly. Just beware, they serve their tea HOT. You may want to wait for it to cool down a bit and pouring from the side instead of straight ahead helps. Our tablecloth still got a bit wet in the process though.  Everything tasted pretty on point, though I was sad they didn't seem to have any xiaolongbao, and to me, had just enough oil to help my cousin with his hangover, lol! We had:  1 kai lan/Chinese broccoli 1 har cheung/shrimp noodle rolls 2 har gow/shrimp dumplings 2 siu mai/pork & shrimp dumplings 1 lohr bahk go/pan fried turnip cake 1 daan taat/egg tart 1 bo luo bao/pineapple custard bun  And one dish stood out to me because I don't ever remember seeing it at any other places. and if I have and just didn't order it before, well shame on me because I've been missing out! It's basically like a sesame ball but it's filled with char siu instead of red bean paste, only the bottom has sesame seeds and it's mostly steamed with only the bottom being pan fried a bit. It's then covered with green onions and just tasted DIVINE! It's a bit funny getting through the mochi exterior but as it's fairly plain flavored, it compliments the sweetie and meaty taste of the char siu well. Both my cousin and I were really happy with it!  All together, was $55 before tip. Not bad, if you ask me! Overall, a very solid dim sum place! Took home what we couldn't finish and am happy to have leftovers for later! Will happily come back again and share this place with others!",

The restaurant was a good size to fit lots of patrons so the waiting is not very long. 10 -15 mins max at 1 PM on a Sunday. Then again there was only 2 of us but they sat us at a table that was enough for 6.  The dim sum was great. My son's fav was the shrimp dumpling with cilantro. he could not get enough of those. Mine had to have been the beef tendon with rice noodle, (Ngow Lam). Doubt that I spelt that correctly. In any case, it had been years since I had had this dish and it was awesome. I had the steamed tripe, salt and pepper shrimp, BBQ Pork buns, (little bit too sticky and needed more filling - East West on Eastern Ave. rivals this one for sure), shrimp dumplings and steamed pork ribs.   Yes, it was a lot of food and we took a lot home and had it for dinner that night.  Wait staff was your typical Chinese Dim Sum Staff, but it was good there nonetheless. We will be coming back to try more!",

NO not recommended at all, first time to place a comment, I respect servers and everybody because I'm also working in a field that requires customer service, I know how hard it is too but atleast give equal treatment, one last our order is simple and not extravagant doesn't need extravagant plating so I dont think it'll take that much time to prepare.",

The food overall is very well cooked and nothing was a bit cold or  too hot. I really the atmosphere here because it's really not that busy and you can bring some friends for a quick bite and head for the road. When you get here, the whole experience is fast and easy. Process is smooth as well, parking somewhat relatively hard and fast at the same time.",

We finally were seated and were given a teapot for complimentary tea... ordered shrimp dumplings (Har gow) and fried noodles with chicken which included carrots and bok choy... the server was quick to take our order and serve our food... the food came out quick, hot and your average Chinese food... when the waitress saw we were done, gave us the check and didn't ask if we wanted anything else.  I do have to note that had the dining room was full and there were only two servers and a manager.  Maybe there was a language barrier but service was decent, an easy in and out cheap dim sum... and yes they have forks for those that are not chopsticks friendly.",

They did not bring a menu which was a little odd but every 2-3 minutes a new food cart with different types of Dim Sum plates rolled by to pick and choose what you want. The steamed bbq pork buns, crispy fried calamari, steamed and fried shrimp dumplings are types of dishes of what you can get here.  The food was not greasy and tasted like it had just been made minutes prior to reaching our table. It appears to be a place for locals as I noticed my friend and I were the only non Chinese customers.  The servers don't speak a lot of English, but I thought it just added more authenticity and flare to this place seeing how we were in Chinatown.  The staff was also friendly.  For two people splitting  3 small dim sum, 3 big dim sum, 1 medium dim sum, 1 special dim sum, 2 chef dim sum plates (10 total items) and a pot of green tea it was approximately 44 dollars.  However, we each enough leftovers for a full second meal.  It is super casual at this spot and you could wear shorts or sandals if you want.  I went at 10:30 am and it was busy enough but didn't have to wait for a table.  They don't take American Express so bring your Visa card or cash. I would recommend this place and plan on going back.",

This isn't my fave spot to get Dim Sum (my fave is in san fran!!) but this place will do just fine! This place is a close second! They have variety of food choices being pushed around in carts, and i think ive tried every single dishes they have to offer lol! They also have a menu for regular dine in if you aren't feeling Dim Sum as well. I always get carried away when i pick and order because it's so overwhelming with all the yummy food options so our table usually look like it's ready to feed a family of 10 when it's usually just me and my mom eating.   The service here was quick and they're pretty packed in the morning so there's usually people rushing a lot and a lot of workers don't speak english so it's a bit hard so i just point and choose!! The actual place isn't really sanitary but that's fine because i'm just here for the food! There's some of my recommendation below, but there's a couple of more dishes i don't remember the name of that's also my faves! This is located off the strip down spring mountain, and this location and orchid garden (i think that's what it's called) are pretty tasty but i recommend this place more!   My recommendations:  Har gow- Chewy with a lot of shrimps!  Shu Mai- Moist and flavorful (chili & soy sauce)  Pai Gwut- Yummy moist steamed pork ribs  Gohk Char Siu Bao- Soft sweet gooey red Pork buns Hom Sui Gok- So soft and glutinous savory pork buns  Ngau Paak Yip- (soupy) with potatoes and hot tripes!! Djeen Dui- Hot Sesame balls with red beans   Crab Balls- W/ Mayo, w Sugar cane stick to munch! Egg Tarts- So BUTTERY AND FLAKEY it's my fave here!!",

The shrimp dumpling (ha cao) was old, shrimp was not fresh it was mushy and the rice wrapper was over steamed and fell apart. The steamed beef rice rolls (churng fun) with soy sauce was awful! It was old and not fresh. It seems like they just re-steamed old left over and the beef had a rubbery texture super chewy for (churng fun). The last thing I had was the fried savory dumpling (ham sui kok), it was cold, super greasy and the filling was under season. I was done ordering after 3 awful dishes and didnt want to waste money and be disappointed some more. The only good thing was the servers pushing the carts, they were nice and came around often. There's much better dim sum places in town! Will not come back.",

So quickly looking up another dim sum place since we were only a few streets over from Spring Mountain, we found this place.  We pulled into the parking lot and it was packed. My husband dropped me off so he could find parking. This place was crazy, but of course because it was Chinese New Year. We ended up getting seated in the \"party\" room which was almost full.   I'm just going to list what was wrong... 1. We were seated next to a door that I thought was locked, but the smokers kept going in and out of. Eventually an employee locked the door for me as I made a motion that I was cold. As one of the smokers tried to re-enter, he was startled that the door was locked. My husband gave him the look and hand motion, Go Around! 2. The table linen was soiled from the previous diners. Ugh! 3. The tea pot! Was it someone elses tea pot and they just refilled it with more tea leaves and hot water! Their was tea leaves stuck to the top of the lid. As I looked around the other tables, they had nice clean tea pots!. 4. Wait time. I know, it was Chinese New Years.  And because the list of things above made me feel icky, so did the utensils and dishes. Even though they appeared and felt clean, unless I knew it was fresh and hot out of the wash, it was still icky for me.  Our server did apologize for the wait and thanked us for our patience.  We ordered house pan fried noodles, honey walnut shrimp, sweet sour pork, and opted for house fried rice instead of white rice. At least the food was good.  Unfortunately, we didn't get the dim sum we was hoping for.  Icky experience + icky ambience = 1-icky star :(",

There were not many people in there at all, but that just means they have more time to give you attention . They have an extensive Dim Sum menu to choose from and a regular menu you may order from. It was kind of like when you get sushi, you choose from a list indicating the quantities you would like to receive. Next to the orders it tells you if it's a Small, Medium, Large, Specialty or Chef special. Each category is associated with a price point along the bottom of the Dim Sum selections page.   We got Snails, Singapore Noodles, Beef Roll, Shrimp Dumplings, Baked Pork Buns, and more. Way to much food! It came out quick and they bring things as you finish them up so your table doesn't get full. The waitresses was really nice and helpful with selecting new things to try.   From an aesthetics point of view, the restaurant did look a bit run down. The table was wobbly and the tea kept spilling on the table cloth. The waitresses did fix it by placing something underneath one of the legs but the table clothes was half wet after the fix.  If you are in the China Town area off the strip or just looking to try some Dim Sum I would recommend this place to stop into!",

If you want to avoid casinos or long waits at ping pang pong, then I definitely recommend this joint as an alternative.  This place has push carts. They have very traditional, reliable favorites. Not too many fancy or innovative items but I'm fine with that - I usually like the OG items the best. Their pricing is not too bad either. I particularly like their bbq pork rice noodle roll as well as their egg told custard buns.  It's soo good!  Their spareribs are also solid. The only thing that wasn't the best were the shrimp dumplings (har gow). I've had better and fresher shrimp.  I've been here three times already and each time the food is solid!  The best way to enjoy dim sum is with multiple people so you can try one of each!",

    "text": "Took my grandparents here for some dim sum since it's their absolute favorite thing in the world! We've been to all the dim sum spots around town, and this is the place we frequent most. It gets extremely busy here, even on weekdays, so plan for a bit of a wait on weekends and especially during holidays.  The dim sum is served traditionally, rolled out on carts categorized by steamed, stewed, or baked and fried. I prefer this style way more over the menu cards with check mark selections. You can usually pick out what's hot and fresh, but the ladies pushing the carts are always awesome and will tell you what's good. I can tell you right now that buns straight out the oven, esp the custard pineapple buns, are sinfully delicious.  The food here seems to be hit or miss depending on the day, and on the really busy days when you've got continuous fresh dim sum being rolled out, it's the best dim sum you'll find in Vegas. Today we picked out a couple of our favorites and most were just average but some were really good. A breakdown of what we got based on today's quality: -Shrimp dumplings (har gow)- 5/10 dim sum classic, they usually do it right but today the crystal wrapper was a tad undercooked -Pork siu mai- 6/10 again a classic and highly recommend here, but skimping on shrimp today -BBQ pork pastry (char siu su)- 8/10 bangin'! Perfectly flakey crust with tons of BBQ pork filling -Fried dough wrapped in rice noodle (zha liang)- 10/10 always good and our absolute favorite here!!! You gotta put in a special order request for it and they make it to order, which is awesome bc that means the you tiao is crunchy! Secret it menu tip: add cilantro to the cheung fun! Comes with hot sauce, peanut sauce, hoisin, and soy sauce -Chicken feet- 7/10 huge chicken feet today, I love their sauce and the flavor penetrated to the bone -Baked BBQ pork bun (char siu bao)- 8/10 you gotta catch these fresh out the oven and we got 'em fresh. Maybe they changed their dough recipe but it's airier than usual -Radish cake (lo bak go)- 7/10 perfect texture and taste, full of shredded radish goodness, missing the crisp exterior as it was the last one sitting on the cart for a while -Sesame balls- 9/10 can't go wrong with these. Soft, chewy dough, heavy on the sesame flavor. Lovely red bean filling -Water chestnut cake- 10/10 some of the best water chestnut cake I've ever had! Slightly sweet and lightly pan fried for a hint of crisp  Overall a wonderful dim sum experience today as always. This is really one of the best spots for dim sum here in Vegas, and if you want authentic food look no further than here. Prices are great and portions are on par with other dim sum places. I really don't understand the reviews on the bad service. It is typical of Chinese restaurants to leave you to enjoy your food in peace and get you in and out ASAP, so if you walk into any traditional spot, don't expect 5 star service. The service here is fast if you can flag someone down, and the people are always friendly and love to chat with my grandparents",

We had a large round w a large lazy Susan to move the dishes around. Chicken corn chowder soup, wonton noodle soup to start with. Both very hot and fresh. 3.5 lb lobster on a bed of noodles, excellent dish. A roast duck, extremely flavorful. Mao Po Tofu good but a little too runny IMO. Salt and Pepper Squid. Nice flavor, battered and deep fried with green onions and hot peppers. Hong Kong pork chops, ok, but pieces cut too small to retain any of the sweet and sour sauce. Beef chow fun standard. Pea pod tips w garlic, excellent. Meal was very authentic, staff attentive, though no plate changes during dinner.  Definitely will keep on my list for return visits after tiring of the Vegas strip food.",

They removed them and didn't wipe the table down. The menu and table had streaks of water and dirt that could be easily removed with my finger nail and napkin. Why not even try to clean the menus?  Food may be 4-5 star but cleanliness and service were both very lacking.   Server took my order and didn't come back at all! Not once to even drop off a check.   My table was right beside the back cashier and had no kidding 25 times a server rushed by to ring up others. 4-5 servers even nudged me while squeezing by the cramped tables and not one of them said sorry! Lol.   No one cleared plates or refilled the tea.   Needed another napkin which I never got.   Went to wash my hands and found a dirty bathroom and no paper towels.   Didn't get a small to go box I needed just left the food there. Paid a different server in front and left confused and bummed.   Spring rolls were good but sweet and sour pork was little undercooked and to many for my chewy pieces and sauce for my liking.",

I went into this restaurant with several of my friends whom were visiting from another country. The first big turn-off was when they seated us, we requested to be by the window. The response our waiter said was, \"Sorry we reserve those tables for larger parties.\" Mind you, the restaurant was empty at this time. So I told my friends let's just eat elsewhere. As we were walking out, the waiter changed his mind and sat us by the window. We were a party of 5.   The main reason why we stayed is because they advertise how good their dim sum is. Well, wouldn't you know, according to the waiter They don't serve dim sum during dinner hours at least on that day anyway. Our waiter was extremely condescending and overly sarcastic when we would ask him about the menu items.  Apparently, from looking at some of the recent reviews here I'm not the only one that experiences rudeness from this location. there's not much more to say. Except that if you enjoy very greasy food, and terrible service, this is the place to go.",

    "text": "If you've been to other dim sum restaurants, you're not missing much here!  My family and I absolutely love dim sum, so when I saw this new place we had to give it a shot. When walking in, we could already tell the ambiance change compared to when it was Cathay house. Much cleaner, however very compact when it came to the seating.  Whenever we go eat dim sum, we usually order the Yang Chow fried rice from the actual menu to accompany the dim sum. There was nothing too special for the fried rice, and it was very very greasy.  The menu breaks down their prices based on the size of the dish, and it was very confusing considering some of the items weren't even provided on the break down. Because dim sum is pay per order, we usually calculate how much we are getting so we know what to expect when the bill comes. Due to the confusion in pricing, we spent over budget.  The actual dim sum itself wasn't as satisfying as we hoped it would be. We ordered the shumai, steamed pork bun, shrimp ball, and chicken feet. The best item was in fact the shrimp ball! It definitely took me back to when I use to get authentic dim sum in downtown California.   The water was obviously from the tap, and the taste was so bad we had to order other refreshments to accompany our meal...  Overall, I would never go out of my way to come back here because there are other establishments  I enjoy like Orchid Garden. The staff was very nice in general, but it didn't compensate for the lack of flavor in the dim sum. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't mind coming here if a friend ever suggested to do so, but I myself wouldn't make the trip.",

    "text": "We went for lunch at noon, on a Sunday. It was crowded and wait time is acceptable for busy weekend lunch hour. We were seated in the main dining area, so the carts came around frequently.  Food: Overall the food came out freah and hot. The common dim sum dishes was acceptable. Shiu Mai (Pork dumpling), Sticky rice in lotus leaf, Beef ball, and Steamed Rice Rolls was good. Egg Custard Tarts had a very good filling, the tart crust however needs improvement, it's a bit too flaky and falls apart. Turnip cake was too soft and fell apart, if they added a little more flour or starch to make it solid, then fry it, the outcome will be much better. Their Coconut Pudding was great, smooth coconut flavor and chewy.  Service: Grand opening, so the service is still smoothing out, which is underatandable. They servers did tey their beat to stay on top of things and went around frequently to check on refills, clear empty dishes, etc.  Atmosphere: The new owners remodeled the inside, closed out the old unused bar and moved it over to the fish tanks, which ia easier for servers to deliver drinks to us. The old bar location has been converted into a private VIP room. Leveled out the entire main dining room intl a single level, which made it better for access and looked nicer. New lighter shade of paint definitely brightened up the place. Flooring has been redone, tiles throughout the hallways and waiting area, carpet has been cleaned. Overall, no old food smell anymore.  We will come back again.",

We were almost ready to get up and leave! Once we ordered from the regular and the dim sum menus, they got confused. OK, then some food arrived in 25 minutes and the dim sum took forever.  The dim sum was horrible but the fried noodles was ok. The drinking water tasted weird and we started joking that it must be toxic. Finally, when we asked for the check, they could not figure out what we had ordered! That was funny to a point but sad. This is a messy place. So it took even longer to get the check.  For those who gave this place 5 stars: go to a good dim sum places and think.  Bottom line: we will never return to this place.",

This is definitely one of the better Dim Sum restaurants you'll find in Vegas. The whole experience is right on point as it should be. Such a great variety of food and its all delicious from the Noodles to the Tea! You'll want to come back after eating here because like me I was way too full to try everything. We had fried noodles, fried fish, shrimp balls, shumai, coconut bread, custard pie, sesame balls & more. The best thing, this place is so reasonable! Only $50 for all that food & a few more plates after. I've noticed a lot of the bad reviews are about the lack of service. Honestly it's a Dim sum restaurant not fine dining. So if you're looking for a place where one server checks on you every 5 minutes this ain't the place for you. Although, I had no issues getting help when needed from different staff members. It's a fast pace environment where they will help you all you have to do is ask. I will be coming here again & again.",

We tried other dishes, but really their shu mai was my favorite. I also liked the sticky rice and their egg tarts. Yum!  They push the carts around for dim sum - one with fried foods, steamed dim sum, noodles/veggies, and rice porridge. They don't all come out at the same time. We found out they had a noodle cart just about when we were too full to eat anymore.  Recommend highly for some good dim sum.",

Not sure if that's just Chinese service, but I'm used to it. Ordered from the regular menu and got old ass food. I was thinking the roast duck would be soooo good, but when it came it looked dried out and bloody. The looks of it spoke diarrhea and food poisoning all over it. I pushed that aside not wanting to get sick, and after that we got a calamari. There's no way you could f that up, but I guess somehow you can. The calamari tasted a little funny, like either it was rotten or old. Like refried? The only thing that was served to us fresh was the chow fun with gravy and the fried rice, but even then the fried rice wasn't even that good. It had chopped up chicken which was old also lol. Nothing served here had fresh anything. I think Darcy Spears needs to come re-evaluate the cleanliness of this restaurant. Everything in here was disgusting. Never coming back again.",

If you been to any dim sum obviously you start ordering like crazy. The food was amazing, but it seemed like they were very limited on what they had. There were a few items I wanted like egg tart, but they didn't seem to have it. Give this place a try! It's good but not perfect. :)",

Good dim sum options although some of the portions are massive!!  With a HK milk tea and more than enough food, we paid $26. A good option if looking for a dim sum fix and have a vehicle. Definitely better value than eating anywhere on the strip.",

My favorite part of today is that literally the whole staff had lunch at the same time and I counted 20 people swarming to grab a portion of their hot pot meal....not one server to help customers.  They were like rats coming out of no where for them selves a bite to eat but non to keep their business running.  This facility is disgusting.   I have never been so disgusted.  I consider myself a happy go lucky Yelper...but this is the WORST.",

Everything tastes better, it's like there was more quality control, more attention on the ingredients, texture and flavor. The service was better than the other Dim Sum houses I been to.  At the end, we all know that service is really what is expected at a Dim Sum place. I'm NOT saying this place is the best. In saying it's worth going to.",

Just noticed the name change and new owner, so I though I'd give it a try and I was impressed with the clean look and the new decor. I was even more surprised at the selection and how quickly the full carts came by our table. Everything we ordered was tasty good. I'd stay away from the beef tendon noodle hot clay pot as it was deceiving. It was few morsels of beef on top and a whole lot of noodles. So disappointed with that dish. However, everything else is pretty awesome. You know you are in an authentic Asian restaurant when there's no music and you can hardly communicate because everyone is talking Cantonese with outside voices. Bring ear plugs or be prepared to do some repeating and yelling. It's loud but you know it's a great place because of the clientele. Bring your friends.",
