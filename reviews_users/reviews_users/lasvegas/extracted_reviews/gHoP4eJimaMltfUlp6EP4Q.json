    "text": "Vegan, gluten-free pizza. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that doesn't taste like sickly sweet cardboard covered in greasy plastic. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that is delicious and something you'd share with friends if you didn't already burn your palate shoving it in to your face?  This is a great place off the strip with delicious thin-crust pizza, with any of the options easily made vegan with their Daiya mozarella. And unlike a lot of places, they know how to get that bubbly, golden crust on the Daiya, so it doesn't turn in to a weird, goopy, oily and sweet mess that happens at a lot of other pizza places that so kindly offer it on their menus. I got the Truffle Oil and Mushroom Pizza, swapping the brie for Daiya, and it was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time. Easily in my top five for vegan pizzas.  Also a winner? Their \"Wok'd\" Sesame Shishito Peppers. It would've probably been something I would've glossed over by myself, but I'm so glad that my friend ordered them because I nearly polished off the plate. So good, and simple. Now that I'm back home, I daydream about them.  Great service, a lovely patio, and amazing vegan options? Love.",

I have to say that our server, I believe her name is Jennifer did an amazing job! I've waited on tables before and I can't imagine handling a big party with kids running around and keeping it as professional and calm as she did. Even though the kids were at times loud and all over the place she waited on us so well and didn't show the frustration I know she must have felt specially when her and the sections  around her were not getting seated. I also appreciate the servers around her that were affected by a big party keeping costumes away. I know my friend had a great time because of the the amazing food and service. Thank you Jennifer for being so great at your job.",

There's multiple TVs. There's also tables you can sit at. You can order food too, of course. It's like a dive-y Sammy's restaurant you can gamble and smoke in. Definitely not a bad spot to kill time, have a drink, and/or grab a late night bite.",

    "text": "They would've gotten 5-stars, but because they gave me the regular pizza crust when I asked for the gluten free crust, and I didn't notice until I already consumed a bite, that's a big red flag for me.  1.  I asked for gluten free crust. 2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.  HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!  First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.  Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!  Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)  They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!  Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.  I'm hoping the staff learned to be more attentive to dietary restrictions.  NOTE TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS:  Make sure you DOUBLE CHECK your order once you receive it and ask to speak with a manager.  This is True anywhere you go.",

    "text": "I'm so sad! I wish I could give a better review but today's experience was so disappointing.  I love Sammy's! The food today was perfect and exactly as expected. This review is aimed to the poor service we received.  I am in town to visit with my mother whom I rarely get a chance to see. We came here to relax and have a nice late lunch and chat. We came in around 2 and the floor was empty. It was a perfect setting to visit and chat.   My issue is with the pressure we received from the waitress. Her name is Alexandra. She was in such a rush to push us in and out. She was very rude. As soon as we got food she seemed to be rushing to clear our table. As soon as she could she was offering us to go boxes and trying to take our empty plates. She was in such a rush for us to hand her plates that a water glass got knocked over. I asked for some more tea with an agenda to finish our visit and she pushed us to take it in plastic to go cups. After she brought us tea in plastic cups she ignored us completely. I had to yell out to her for attention to get a little more tea.   In total we were only sitting in the restaurant for under an hour of time. Our bill was nearly $100 and we were treated like we had no value. I see no reason to feel so pressured and rushed to leave. This really spoiled my visit with my mother and I can't believe the disrespect during such a slow time on the restaurant floor. This was really inappropriate and I hope that no one has to endure this experience.",

The pepperoni pizza had a dry crust, too little sauce, too little cheese, and lacked flavor.  I didn't particularly enjoy it.  The duck tacos 'tapas' was okay, but lacking in flavor.  The ceasar salad had very little dressing on it, and some of the lettuce was wilted.  I had the second-worst hurricane (a mixed-drink made with rum and fruit-juice) I've had to date here.  It included a straw that was shorter than the glass it was in.  I didn't leave hungry, but wasn't terribly pleased about that.  I also spent more than I was happy with for what I got.  I would have been fine with the cost had the food been as good as I had been led to believe it should have been from the other reviews.",

The food here is always amazing. Everything is great. Never had a dish we didn't like. We have been into this location before and the other one before moving to it's new GV location. Taylor usually takes care of us when we are in this location (Sahara) and he is an outstanding bertender. Honestly we come back because of him....and the delicious food. But we really enjoyed meeting Cher and will probably dine in the restaurant next time so she can be our server.   I hear their late night happy hour is a great deal. Nearly all the appetizers are half price! And the apps are pretty much al we order from. Big selection. Duck tacos, hummus, coconut shrimp, lobster bisque, etc. The pizzas are great too. Really like the options they have for gluten free and vegans. Open 24 hours with the full menu available. Just a great place!",

They have a variety of tapas to start you off, a lot of specialty pizzas, pstas, sandwiches, etc.  And starting at about $10 a pie (these are individuals with lots of leftovers imminent) they're not too expensive.   This location houses an attached bar that is a secluded and surprisingly awesome place to hang out at, whether you're having a meal or not.",

We also tried their new desert which was warm donuts. The waiter said since it was our first time trying it it was on him. Cant beat it. Will defiantly be back very soon for more tapas.",

You don't know how many times at other restaurants I'm confronted by a waiter's bewildered expression like i'm speaking foreign or they don't know what to do, so they try  to charge you double. Let's  face it, if you're trying to eat right by incorporating salads in the usual method of trying to fill up on protein not fatty foods when you're dining, then i strongly recommend this place. There's only a handful of restaurants I can count where sometimes I can't eat the whole salad and these extra large portions can be a challenge. I wish they had these in Los Angeles, my other part time residence.",

I was bummed because I ordered these in the past and I don't remember them being stuffed with all that lettuce. Seriously, not very good. My daughter ordered the cheese pizza. She told me it was spicy. At first I didn't believe her, so I tried it.  To my shock, the pizza sauce was spicy. A little odd for a kids pizza. I'll return, I'll just order differently.",

    "text": "I was disappointed with my latest trip to Sammy's.  I've eaten there at least 6 times before, but this time everything seems to have gone downhill.  To start, there was no host or hostess around, for a while.  It took forever to even get water, and we were seated outside when it was warm out, so the wait seemed even worse.  It wasn't busy inside, so I'm not quite sure what the hold up was.  Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed to disappear for long stretches, and when our food finally came and we had problems with our orders, he was no where to be found, so another server handled the problems. As far as the food, the lebni was great as always.  We tried the new White Tuna and Spinach salad, it was very good.  I wanted to try something other than my usual entree, but I couldn't decide what to order.  The waiter recommended the Organic Arugala and Pear Pizza.  I instead ordered the new Diavola Pizza, wanting to try something different.  What a mistake.  It was horrible.  Slabs of hard salami on spinach, with gouda and peppers.  Just too much of a mish mash of tastes for me.  My boyfriend tried the new Sicilian Pizza, and hated it almost just as much.  They replaced our pizza's with a 5 Cheese and a Mozzerella Pizza at no charge, but at that point both of us had lost our appetite.  Next time I'll stick with something tried and True like the LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza or try the waiters recommendation for the Arugala & Pear.",

The pizza was good, it's not something I am going to crave, I got plain pepperoni.  The crisp Brussels sprouts that I got as an appetizer were okay.  They weren't very crispy. They were hot and mushy.  I have only had Brussels sprouts once before in my life so maybe they are supposed to be like that? They had a very \"toasty\" burnt taste and a truckload of balsamic. They also STUNK! Holy moly.  I had the salted caramel pudding but it didn't taste salty to me at all.  Is there some sea salt that should have been sprinkled or was the top layer of sauce supposed to be salted caramel sauce?  It tasted super buttery.  I am not complaining believe me I nearly licked the glass clean. The service from my server was great.  I didn't catch her name.  I did see the manager on her floor using her smart phone and one of the kitchen employees was giving the to go guy a back massage in full view of patrons.  Hey I am for sneaking peaks at your phone and we all need a stress relief sometime anyone who's worked in the food service industry knows that to be True, but maybe those things can take place in the BOH.",

This place is very nostalgic to me, because it was my first \"gourmet\" pizza experience as a child, and tonight I was reminded of why I used to love this place.   My family and I shared a Chinese chicken salad, the bbq chicken pizza, garlic chicken pizza, garlic shrimp pizza, the New York style, and the Thai chicken pizza. Talk about pizza galore. The ingredients on the pizzas were all very fresh, and the dough was so soft. The cheese was also really thick and chewy which I am fond of. My favorites were the garlic chicken and shrimp and the bbq chicken pizza. I forgot how large the pizzas actually were so we ended up taking half of the pizzas home. IMO, this place is still better than CPK (CPK is overrated and overpriced).  Server was nice and accommodating.  Will definitely be back if we're in the mood for wood fired pizza.",

We ordered the Asian Sampler platter. Shrimp skewers, pot stickers, and chicken satay, two of each. First issue is that the portions were tiny. Like...bite sized. Small bite sized tiny. And at $13, it's like $2 a bite. So overpriced. Also under seasoned, pretty badly. We had to drown the food in sauce to taste much at all. So bummer.   The pizza was mostly good. We had the garlic chicken, thin crust. The chicken was also a little under seasoned both in terms of salt and the garlic itself. Very little of both. But the thin crust was amazing, and the cheese...to die for. Like...I'd line my casket with it. Simply delicious.   In summary...fair food, just under seasoned. Some is a little over priced and/or under sized, but some are also just right and even good deals. More like a 3.5 overall.",

The last time I ate here, they forgot one of our drinks, forgot to put dressing on the side of a salad, and then when the brought out the remade salad undressed, they didn't bring any dressing on the side, I had to ask three times for salt (we sat outside and there wasn't any on the table), and had to ask twice for simple syrup for my iced tea. Some of these were special requests, but a restaurant like this should be able to handle that.   One of the strange things was that there were a total of 5 different people that came to the table. I'm sure this contributed to the inconsistencies we endured.   It's such a shame because the food here is actually really good. Once we eventually get our food how we ordered it, I've never not enjoyed it. If the service was better, I'd be much happier dining here.",

I ordered the flat iron steak with fries and my Brother ordered a petite filet with fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts. The steaks were not seasoned and were tasteless. They were both very small with very little sides. We payed $19.50 for the flat iron steak and $27.99 for the petite filet. Very disappointed with the food for the amount of money we payed. We weren't even the bit satisfied, so after we left we went for a pizza. Besides, we usually go on a Friday or Saturday night and there are never many people in the restaurant. We won't be returning.",

My server never came up to ask how I am or if I wanted to start with an appetizer just nothing and asked if I was ready to take my order. Normally I'm a patient person and totally understand if they're super busy but at least let me know that you'll be right with me or know I was acknowledged I was waiting. I've been in the food industry for almost 8 years and I've never pulled this especially if I ever did that I would be in trouble for having my guest wait that long. I would give them 3 stars for keeping up with my refills but at least have a good time at work and smile!",

After a night of drinks and karaoke (where one guy thought Linkin Park was some sort of Death Metal group the way he sang \"In The End\"), we were convinced to come here by Cheska at the mere mention of \"tacos\". Oh, not just ordinary tacos mind you, but duck tacos. Yes, the aquatic fowl that is wildly enjoyed by this Yelper.  Lo and behold to our surprise, after hours, they have their own set of Happy Hour type pricing and serve tapas (which the duck tacos are a part of).  You'll have to excuse my lapse in memory, I had more than a couple of beers prior to getting here and then some when we did get here, heh.   Sirloin Skewers, drizzled with a sweet teriyaki glaze - it was bit on the sweet side, and the beef being a little tough, but it was still good and wasn't overly sweet/drowned out by the sauce  Mousakka - with nicey spiced lamb (which I normally don't care for) and melted cheese, but this was really good served with pita bread  Duck Tacos - shredded duck meat, in a small hard corn shell, served with chopped up veggies and a cilantro type sauce; it was good, a bit on the small side, but it wasn't something that would knock you off your feet, still one of my favorite things we got  I also believe we got other dishes, but again, my mind was too cloudy to remember. I do remember, that everything was decently good (I know I was drunk, but even I know what tastes good or not). I wouldn't mind coming back here in the wee hours of the night/morning to meet up with Dave again. Good food, GREAT company (friends and Dave). I had no problem that when we did leave, the sun was coming up and I wouldn't mind doing that again.",

    "text": "Loved this place. Their pizza and salads are so good. There was five of us so we decided to order 3 salads and share since they are huge and ordered 2 woodfired pizza's (Margherita and Pepperoni).   I really enjoyed the salad I picked: the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp. My sister ordered the Caesar salad which was average and the other one we ordered was the Red Quinoa which I wasn't crazy about. I didn't like the quinoa and it was kind of spicy but that is more my personal preference. Everyone else loved it but hands down everyone loved the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp.   The pizza was good...nice and thin for the woodfired. I wonder how thin their thin pizza's are. I thought the pizza's would be a little bigger though but after eating the salads first, it was a good amount of pizza to eat...not too much.   The service was good...friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable too.   The best part had to be the dessert: all five of us shared the Messy Sundae (vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel sauce with walnuts and whip cream). Soooo good. There was even some left over after all five of us digged in. However, the ice cream was put in this weird plastic like wine cup which made it kind of hard to get the ice cream out and the chocolate fudge on the bottom didn't make it easier because it made the cup slide. I would recommend they change the presentation of the sundae into a bowl to make it easier for sharing.",

The pizza wasn't bad but not one of the best in Vegas.  I do like that they offer fat free mozzerella as a choice.  The thin crust pizzas tasted better than the wood fired ones.  They have a TON of different cheeses for pizza including gouda, goat and bulgarian cheese.     The atmosphere is nothing to go crazy about...standard small bar but who cares with a menu like this?

    "text": "This place is garbage.  Every few years I end up here for some reason and by the end of the meal every time I think to myself, \"why did I come back here?\"  The epitome of bad chain-restaurant food.  Their namesake pizza is all dough and the crust is soft.  Crust should be crusty, not like a big slab of white bread.  The menu is a bland sampling of everything popular at other restaurants.  Tapas?  Really?  Those are not tapas.  They're appetizers.  Chicken Lettuce Wraps stolen from Pf Chang are not tapas.  Garlic bread, dumplings, baba ghanoush, thai chicken skewers.  What the hell is this menu?  These are appetizers, not tapas.  Also this is a crappy, bready-ass pizza place with wilted lettuce salads and bottled dressings and surely no real chef anywhere near the kitchen.  They want to please all of the suburban happy-hour housewives out there sipping an overpriced glass of grocery-store chardonnay so they lay out every bs thing that is trendy on someone else's menu.  Sliders and tapas and wraps and hummus and chicken lettuce wraps and pizza and tacos and burgers and doughnuts.  Enough.  If you want sliders, hit slidin thru.  If you want tapas, go to Firefly.  If you have a hankering for pizza, go to Settebello or Aurelio's or Due Forni.  Hungry for tacos?  Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo.  This place specializes in bad renditions of food done way better elsewhere, made for people who don't know any better or don't care.  Just do one thing well!  Your namesake pizza is a disgrace.  Start there.  Another warning sign of a crummy restaurant is when you see trademark signs after their menu items.  Welcome to Chili's or Applebee's or Sammy's or whatever other pre-made frozen garbage restaurant with sauces that show up at the backdoor every monday in a  bag.  Everything heated up to order!  Bleccch.  So bad I get mad.",

I was out and about Las Vegas with my parents and they tend to be picky eaters. So I thought back to some of my friends who have special meal requests, and I lovingly thought of my friend Katie K. who introduced me to Sammy's a while back.   Katie has a distinguished palate when it comes to food, so I figured this would be a good, safe place to bring my parents.  We were in the area, so I hopped on Yelp, got some directions, and Boom Boom Pow....we were at Sammy's.  Between the three of us, we shared two pizzas. Enough food for everyone on this light afternoon lunch. The vegetarian pizza (eggplant, peppers, onions, and such), and my all time favorite pizza (goat cheese, sauteed wild mushrooms and spinach).  Everything was fantastic. Fairly healthy, not overly greasy, full of flavor, and a meal that just makes you happy.  Service is very good, and the menu is quite diverse.   I can't wait to come back for the Tapas menu!  Sammy's is going to be my \"go-to\" before big night's out in Vegas!  P.S. For you chain hater's....yeah, it's a chain. Mostly in San Diego, but it's a great one. Not a major one like CPK though. Local vibe still!  P.P.S. There is a 24 Hour Bar attached to this location! Score!",

(As well as beer specials). The duck tacos, chicken satays, and steak skewers are a must try. So bomb!   I've had two different bartenders/servers. One is alright, the other is great! Super friendly and cheerful. One person in our group was trying to pick a song with their jukebox which wasn't working at the time, so our server gave us a list of stations we could choose from. Although we didn't change it, it was very thoughtful of him. Wish I could remember his name.  We will be back!",

I had the chicken chopped which was delicious as always. I couldn't eat 1/2 of it because there was so much. One person with us had a pizza. I don't remember which one, but it was tasty. I usually have the BBQ pizza which is GREAT. Another friend had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was delicious. I'm not so sure about the grits. The texture was more like polenta.  If it really is polenta, they should call it Shrimp and Polenta. If they really are using grits, they definitely need to find a better way to cook them. Overall though, it was a good experience. Service was really good.",

    "text": "Sitting here trying to think of what to say in my review for Sammy's.   I've been close a few times to just closing it and revisiting it another day when it suddenly dawned on me:  my writer's block is BECAUSE of Sammy's.   Allow me to explain:  5 star reviews are easy because you just can't wait to spill your guts about your love for that place and you want to describe every component of your meal as if you were extolling the virtues of your children.  Vice versa for 1 star reviews: the hyperbole and metaphors just write themselves when the server ignores you for an hour or your $15 burger is ice cold in the middle.   3 stars though on yelp?  \"A-OK.\"  ?   Where's the fun in that?   Sammy's delivers decent, but unspectacular food with good to great service with average value for your dollar.   -SLAP-  Wake up!  I go here once every few weeks because a friend of mine at work loves their Ahi Tuna burgers.   I've had them.  They're okay.  Yup.  \"A-OK\".   I've also tried their Mini Salmon Burgers, their mini kobe beef burgers, their white tuna and spinach salad, their chicken and hummus wrap, the Diavola pizza, and the Oak Roasted Salmon Filet.   They were all... you guessed it.  \"A-OK\".  Yaaaaaaaaaawwn.  Where was I?     Nothing has blown my mind.  Nothing has gotten me on the phone with the Clark County Health Department.   Everything has satisfied me (okay except the Salmon Filet because it was $16 and really not worth that), and unfortunately for the entertainment value of this review, nothing has offended me.     They do give a discount for CSN employees (and maybe students?  I didnt ask because I don't really care), so props for that!     So yeah, 3 stars.  If you made it to this part of the review, you deserve a compliment.   Go you!",

Margarita Pizza it was okay. Ordered the braised lamb tacos what came was stewed lamb that reminded you of the texture of cat food. Nothing remotely like it was described apparently Sammys isn't cooking their little Kobe Burgers to temperature anymore but didn't tell me until I got my extra well-done burgers. I know for a fact that the corporate chefs and trainers would have been very disappointed with tonight's performance on all fronts the only saving grace was very nice front house manager that tried to make things better.",

I usually order the tomato basil soup when it's cold outside. It's  absolutely delicious, the chicken hummus wrap is also very good.  All of their salads are absolutely huge and very tasty. Unfortunately their pizzas are very inconsistent. They have been either overcooked (burned) or undercooked and chewy. So be careful.

Boo  They did remake the plate. Hope it's better.  So upon receiving the remade pasta plate, both the waitress AND I were surprised at the amazing improvement there was. Which had me beg the question: if you knew that the actual dish should (and could) look like what we ended up with,, why on earth would you even send that sub-par  plate of food.  Makes me a little nervous about this place.  I do, however, like the little outdoor vibe for drinks, so my recommendation is, if you wanna go with some friends after work for a quick after work drink, it might be cute for a bit, but if you want food...it may be good, but it may not be. Apparently the quality control is a bit iffy.",

Pizza has a nice crust and I love all the flavor combos- I like the garlic shrimp so far. Duck tacos were good.My favorite thing is the ahi or salmon sliders. I've been to this one like 3 times and a total of 5 times to a different location so I havent tried much, but all has been good and satisfying portions.   Why I give it 5 stars is the service was very attentive, some of the best I've gotten at a casual joint actually. This location has a very attentive staff, back of the house was quick with orders but still cooked things right- kudos! One lunch day in particular a mens baseball team, their kids and familes filled the restaurant soon after we ordered. Our waiter was taking care of us even though they got sieged. Drinks didn't get neglected, had a drink before mine was done. Checked on us often and got our tab taken care of fast.  I do appreciate when people are warm and genuinely friendly- service with a smile does count just as equally as speed and attentiveness.",

Tough decision since their menu is fairly varied, but we settled on the grilled chicken, gorgonzola, and sugared walnut salad, along with the New York thin crust pizza.  Huge salad, portions large enough for 4, but two off us managed to scarf down every tasty bite of the tender grilled chicken and greens dressed with a flavorful balsamic vinaigrette.  The pizza toppings were seasoned just right, lightly layered on a crispy crust.  Everything was satisfying, including the nice  attentive service.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Sammy's in a while and I was bummed to learn that they no longer have lunch specials and apparently they have not for quite sone time.   Visiting for lunch today the check quickly added up. You can easily spend 20.00 on lunch, getting a salad or pizza with a drink and tip.   The server we had was very friendly and attentive. Food came out pretty quickly. The food I will say is good. Salads are made with fresh ingredients. Pizzas are served hot and fresh as well. The food is good, I don't know if I would say it's worth 20.00.   20.00 for lunch is where I feel it is a bit pricey.   With menu items being that expensive I don't think it's in the budget to visit Sammy's often.",

Yet I commend Sammy's and their manager Karissa for taking the time to listen & respond to its customers when they didn't have to. Thank you so much, Karissa.  We returned to this location, and the pear & arugula pizza was delicious again & perfect this time. The gluten free crust was the best my partner said he's ever had. Everyone enjoyed the ducks tacos. It was my partner's daughter's birthday, and we all loved the gigantic ice cream sundae. The sundae was something I wouldn't normally order as an adult lol, but omg it was goood.  Our server was delightful; she really went the extra mile. From recommending an Arnold Palmer (his daughter's first, which she loved), to carrying her birthday candle to the side so the wind wouldn't blow it out before she could, to just being genuinely cheerful, she and the manager on duty provided exceptional service.   It was beautiful sitting in the outside booths on a sunny day. I think this is a great lunch spot, a little oasis in the middle of the city. And after feeling valued as a customer, they've got my loyalty. Thank you again, Sammy's, Karissa, the manager on duty that day, & to all of the servers!",

    "text": "Ate here on Saturday 5-28-16 around 1PM. $48.67 got us a salad, an appetizer, some tacos, two drinks, and a messy sundae.      The menu seems to have changed since the last time I came...they are trying out tapas now and have a huge variety...everything from edamame to baba ghanoush.  I think they are trying too hard with these new menu items.  Just stick to what you're good at, Sammy's.  (Pizza and salad)   Speaking of, I had the greek salad and it was truly wonderful.  It was fresh and had plenty of baby persian cucumbers, feta cheese, olives, red onions, tomatoes, and pepperoncini. It came already dressed in just the right amount of house dressing.  They make a damn good salad!   I had an appetizer as my main course...I had the seasoned shredded beef empanadas which had dried currants, onions, and spicy salsa verde on the side for dipping.  The crust was nice but the filling was bizarre...the cumin was overpowering and the dried currants were a strange addition...like tiny little raisins.  I can't recommend this dish at all.    The best part of the meal should have been the messy sundae.  Unfortunately the ice cream was freezer-burned and hard as a rock.    Food took foooreverrrrrr to come out. I asked the waiter, \"Will my pizza be long?\" and he replied, \"No, ma'am, it will be round.\"   HAHAHAAHAHAH All kidding aside, I have no urge to go back.  Seriously.",

I had the pleasure of eating with my friend here about a month ago and before I walked in the front door I already liked the vibe. Theres ample parking and the entrance faces the street. The patio was amazing allowing for small and big parties comfortable seating. Kudos to Bethany our server, she really knows how to treat her guest from start to finish. Bethany gave great recommendations throughout our dinner and I couldn't be happier. I am the Asia Appetizer and the shrimp skewers were. The Asia Chicken Salad with balsamic sauce was delicious and tasted really fresh. For my the main course my friend had the NY Pizza and he loved it. I had the Salmon one a bed of thin strips of cabbage and it was to die for, since the Salmon was crispy all around and tender and juicy on the inside I couldn't get enough. My friend had soda and I tried the Peach Mojito and the original Mojito both very good, yet my favorite was the Peach Mojito. Now we are both full and almost grasping for air and hopping we can successfully make it out the door and into our cars before the food coma kicked in, Lol, then the desserts arrived. I pulled through with all my will and take a Spoon fill of The Salted Caramel mouse, and it was Glorious. I decided that no matter what happened that day I would finish that marvelous smooth and silky treat. I am happy to say that I am alive, and hoping to bring my family to dine in the patio with a bottle or three of Wine. Thank you for the great service and memorable experience.",

    "text": "Came here for a late Mother's Day Dinner with my bf & his parents since his mom was craving their Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. There was barely anyone in the restaurant so we were seated right away!  We decided to order the Arugula Salad, Lobster Bisque, Tomato Basil Soup, (2) Shrimp Angel Hair Pastas and the Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. There was a couple of things we complained about during our visit: first, the soups came out pretty cold. We asked our server if it could be heated up but they were nice enough to bring us a fresh and hot new soup. Second, our server was barely around our entire dinner and didn't even offer us bread with our soups. We had to ask other servers who walked near our table for refills and other requests. Third, the two pastas were lacking sauce and were very dry. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side and thankfully they brought out a big bowl of sauce for us to put on our pastas which definitely helped. However, throughout most of the meal I had to keep adding salt and Parmesan cheese to mask this \"dishwater\" taste the pasta had.   I did enjoy their arugula salad which was a huge portion for 4 people to share, even though we ordered a small which was great. I wish our experience was better, especially considering the price we paid. You can find better meals and better service at a much lower price elsewhere.",

The pizza we ordered was also more greasy than what I had remembered, and it took forever to get everything. We ordered hummus as an appetizer and they gave us a huge serving of it, with very little pita bread which was annoying.

We were a little concerned that on a Friday night they werent that busy, but in the end it served beneficial to us because we were able to enjoy a lovely evening without a packed crowd. Also the weather that night was gorgeous which helped out the already wonderful ambiance.....i especially loved the fire pit outside. The food was great.....we ordered the dip trio...hummus, baba ganoush and some fresh milk cheese topped with cumin. It was very good, the fresh baked flat bread was nice. We also ordered the NY style pizza which was delicious.... the service was great and the dishes came out with perfect timing. For dessert we orderd the messy sundae which was good as well, good quality ice cream. And to top it off i got a 20% discount for being an lvac member. I will definitely visit this establishment again...good food at great prices and excellent service....good job!",

We sat a the table in the lounge since the restaurant itself was close off.  Ordered a couple items off the tapas portion since they were half off due to happy hour.  Nothing really stood out, but the duck tacos.  It was the only item I had to look up on the menu to see what i was eating, but it's still not enough to have me coming back.  This is a harsh review, but I guess i am taking it out on Sammys since H&R was closed.  Sorry guys.",

We will, but not @ the west sahara one.  I appreciate the phone validating my review.  Thank yiu.",

GF's choice...I thought I would hate it. Turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. Topped with bubbly Romano cheese and served with herb rubbed pita bread. I really loved this. Oh ya and it had huge chunks of soft and sweet garlic.  We shared the Sun-dried Tomato and Goat Cheese Pizza w/ Pine Nuts. This was also very good but kinda small. Also shared a Beef Skewer Salad. Nice amount of beef ( 6 skewers ) but not much else that was that good...some lettuce, peanuts, bean sprouts, and grilled pineapple ( probably made the whole salad worth it ). The salad was $15.99 and just OK. But is was pretty big.   Next time probably skip the salad and order the one I know I like ( Thai peanut ), or another entree.   Good for for a decent price. Service was good and tea was great. ( iced passion un-sweetened. ) Nice outside seating also.",

The restaurant was quiet at 5 p.m when we went and the waitstaff were nice to the kids. It was happy hour so all the appetizers were half-off; I am assuming the drinks were to, but I did not have a drink. The food was really good.  The lettuce wraps were amazing.  I also had the balsamic chicken salad which was uber tasty.  The kids cleared their plates, which is always a good sign.  Would definitely go back again and again.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for years since I worked at my second real estate office, C-21 MW, 2000-ish, (which used to be located nearby)- how come it's taken me so long to write a review?!  Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago, when we used my promotional Birthday Gift, the iconic Messy Sundae (ooey-gooey caramel and fudge topped vanilla ice cream with walnuts and whipped topping; it's one of my fave desserts of all time---yeah, it's that good). It was a saturday and was way before the lunch rush. So, it was quiet, until the large family who kept asking for \"gluten-free\" this & that arrived (Oh, I'm sure that their server was annoyed. Ok, maybe they weren't as annoying as the family who complained about the salads being \"way too big\" and thus their bill was adjusted, ahem; that was on another past visit). We got a different pizza this time (we've tried five different ones total, over the years), and had the truffle fries (to-die-for romano cheese-topped goodness). Our son loved the fries. He's kind of a picky eater, meaning, he won't eat it if he doesn't like it, picky.    Service is always good. The bathroom is always clean. The rest of the restaurant grounds/main dining area, is always clean. If you can brave it, it's cold right now, there is seating outside, in the front. There is a bar part, too (separate---and yes, you guessed it, I've been to that part, too, years ago, though). And Happy Hour too. The food is solid--- from the pizzas, and must mention that the mini kobe beef burgers are really yummy, too. The salads are really good, too (I wouldn't be complaining about how big they are, either, hahaha).  It's christmas time, and there's a gift card promotion (Buy $50, Bonus $10 certificate), so why not get some christmas shopping done here, too? Grab a bite, try the kobe minis, along with a pizza, and get the messy sundae. Sounds like a plan.   Also has a few other locations: centennial, flamingo (9516), rainbow/215, and green valley, too.",

Plenty of options on drink choices and tapas type apps.   The food is always fresh and the service is always fast and friendly.   Our favs are the hummus it comes with pita but the gluten free option is lettuce wraps (butter lettuce pieces). When we order this we ask for both and they are always nice to do so. I like the lettuce and husband likes the pita.  Small pizzas you can do gluten free or regular. For the True vegan option I believe you have to select the gf option and of course the Daiya. I'm not a fan of gf or Daiya but husband has order that with mushrooms and kala olives and it was ok.  My personal fav fav fav.....is the quinoa and beet salad. Not only is it yummy it's freaking huge!!!!!!!! It's big enough for three people but I like to eat it until my jaw feels likes it's going to fall off :D it's yummy.  Lots of choices here. Good for groups or small groups of picky eaters because they have something for everyone.   Want to eat cotton candy for dinner??? You can also do that here...wow.",

Maybe I am too critical but I expect my water to be refilled without asking, to be asked - when my beer is empty - if I would like another, be checked on during appetizers and the meal as to if we are enjoying the meal and is everything good.  With all that being said and the food being adequate there are many other choices with better pizza and service - which may be why the place was 2/3 empty. I will move onto other places - good luck",

If you don't mind the drive, I recommend that location....especially if you don't want to have stomach aches from the greasy foods from THIS location on Sahara.

I haven't been to a Sammy's since the Centennial location. I ordered the Barbecue Chicken Pizza and my wife had the duck tacos (and 3 glasses of wine, woo-hoo!)   The food tasted fresh and was very delicious. I loved their tropical tea. Food is what I am always going for but I have to say the service was absolutely fantastic. We were served on by Nick? He was very friendly, and courteous. I most certainly will be back to smash another pizza and a couple gallons of that tropical tea.",

And of course I was wrong!  I was fully surprised at how good the food was for that time of day and for that price.  Late night happy hours usually mean getting rid of the bad stuff but everything tasted fresh and delicious.   I think I might be obsessed with the duck tacos.   Perfect balance of flavors and textures.   I also really liked the baba ganoush a lot.   It might be one of my favorites I've ever had.   The service was pretty good for just one bartender working.   One of the runners or cooks came out with him to help carry our food and knocked over a water glass.  Very quick to remedy the situation.   I really appreciated that.   Will definitely be coming back!",

We ordered the meatball appetizer, and it did not disappoint. The presentation was an added plus. I ordered the New York pizza, which had pepperoni and salami on it. It was 12 inches and very tasty! My wife loved her artichoke pizza with its cauliflower crust. We finished it off with the messy sundae, which was incredible. They have a full bar menu of libations and did not give us split checks for food and alcohol like many two in one venues do around the valley. They could use some TVs up on the walls. We had the best server ever. Her name was Mojca, and she was absolutely attentive and accommodating. If you're visiting Vegas and want a great locals spot, come to this place. Well done!",

The service is the only thing I feel bad for rating so low, they had a system error so we waited for about 20 minutes before someone came back and took our order again. I felt bad for the staff so they are the only reason I give it a 2 stars rating.   I would rather have metro pizza, we tried 4 different pizzas. The 5 cheese was a little funky for me, the buruta was bland, the margarita had too much garlic, the pepperoni (I didn't taste because I do not eat meat) but was told it was good.   I will not be returning I have had my share and not impressed.",

Tried the margarita pizza and it was delicious. The dough was crispy on the outside yet thick and chewy on the inside. Perfect balance of cheese and sauce. I think what really makes a great pizza is truly the dough! toppings are easy. But the dough, you have to perfect it and Sammy's did a great job!   Another item we absolutely loved was their kale salad. It had bits of dried cranberry and other greens in it. So mixed with the dressing and everything else the salad was light yet filling and had a sweet yet creamy taste to it. I highly recommend this salad for lunch. I don't know if it'll hold very well if you get it to go.   Service was excellent both times we visited. The staff was attentive and welcoming.  Overall, I highly recommend them for their pizza and pasta.   Happy Dining,  JT",

The biggest disappointment was the romaine salad. $9 for 8 leaves of semi wilted romaine lettuce sprinkled with a few chopped tomatoes and feta cheese that didn't cover the top layer.

When we got there the restaurant was pretty much empty.  It was my daughters baptism so I had family in from other parts of town too we were trying to enjoy with. Everything was slow from the beginning drinks alcohol bread.  It took forever for us to even get our order in and we told her from the beginning we wanted separate checks and who was on what check.  The waitress forgot drinks and food all night, seemed overwhelmed and actually gave one of my guests pizzas to another table so he sat waiting for over an hour wondering where it was and finally ordered French fries to hold him over until the pizza that was coming never came, he then canceled it after he realized she had no idea where or what happened.  The food came out here and there, one salad appetizer here, someone rises meal there, and the pizzas all took the longest.  We had basically ask her over an over for things and wait a long time for everything.  She apologized but after 2 half hours we decided to skip desert we just wanted to leave.  It then took like a half hour if not longer to figure out everyone's separate checks (which we asked for in the beginning) almost every check she gave out was wrong.  The other girl that was there even apologized again for the long long wait.  I just wanted to enjoy the day of my daughters baptism with great food, with my family and relax.  It was not relaxing or enjoyable AT ALL everyone was annoyed and hungry. Won't be going back regardless of how tasty I think the food is, it's not the first time I've had crappy slow service in there but this was the worst!!!",

When it arrived, it was very thin crust indeed, so thin, the juices from the sausage and mushrooms seemed to have melted through the crust, it was impossible to eat without a utensil.  My hubby was trying to do right and keep to his diet, so he ordered the Caesar salad with chicken breast, it had to be the biggest salad, it was big enough for the two of us and then some!

After walking in, my first thought was, \"this does not look good!!\" I should have gone with my initial reaction. The service was mediocre but the pizza was bland, to be kind. When you walk into a wood fired pizza place you should be greeted with the fresh aroma of burning wood, baking pizza dough and melting cheese. Not here. It looked like a Pizza Hut and had no aromas of fresh cooking food, let alone wood fired pizza. I ordered the margarita pizza, one I order nearly every time I visit a real pizza joint. What came out was not at all tasty. The tomatoes were cut too thick, making the crust soggy from all the \"moisture\" not steamed off. The crust, while a meager attempt at a Chicago style deep dish, was very flat. It had very little taste, had no hand tossed texture and zero crispness. The cheese was in sufficient quantity but looked like it was microwaved and tasted as such. The signature melted spots on top of a True \"fired oven\" pizza were nowhere to be seen. To give fair marks, it did have ample fresh basil, but much of it was older looking leaves with a wilt that should never be served on a True pizza. The second pie, a pepperoni, was just as sad. When we asked for a to-go-box for the last three slices, they were brought out in a clear plastic pastry box, stacked on each other. We figured this was their pizza box, but the table next to us got a traditional box. Apparently when you have only three slices left, you don't get a box. Do yourself a favor and skip this pie shoppe. You'll find better pizza at Dominoes.",

The waiter was fabulous, very friendly and attentive. But the pizza was inedible. The gluten-free crusts are apparently frozen, but they were not cooked completely through, and had a really off putting taste. The sauce on a pineapple pizza had no flavor, and a margarita pizza was even worse.   Have had great gluten-free pizzas in other cities, and even much better ones from my own freezer at home. If not for the friendly waiter we probably would have just left the restaurant. We picked off some of the cheese and toppings and ate what we could.",

The standout facet of our visit was by far our server - Snoopy D. Yes, that's her name. At least that's what was on the receipt. She was so helpful and very attentive. When my wife couldn't decide between the hummus and shrimp and crab dip she told us she'd surprise us. When she brought out the dip she ended up bringing us a full size shrimp dip AND some hummus. The hummus free of charge! This was an excellent surprise but it didn't stop there. After we were finished she offered us The Messy Sundae; we respectively declined. On her next stop, she dropped off The Messy Sundae and said \"I don't listen very well\". Again this was free of charge! Needless to say we will be back again!",

My family and I enjoy the duck tacos, truffle fries, and lobster mac n cheese but now lobster mac n cheese is gone from happy hour and duck tacos is only two pieces. I'll still come back and enjoy my meal with family and friends just maybe expand my horizons away from the tapas menu.",

She always has a smile and gives great Flippin service.  Over and beyond what's expected.  Extra napkins, prompt refills and exceptional ordering skills.  Kat huge thanks!  Sammie's is a comfortable well decorated place to take friends and family for great pizza or the Tavern is open 24/7 !

She said they put cayenne pepper on the croutons. I guess that's why the croutons look so red in the pic. I've had lots of Caesar Salads and have never had this. This salad was a total waste because  I couldn't eat it. I asked if I could bring it back and have them make me s new one but the answer was NO. They have all the croutons already made up so I was stuck. I asked why would they do that and she said the recipe comes from Corporate. After checking the menu there was no mention of cayenne pepper listed. I made 2 calls to corporate to find out why and they didn't call me back. WHO DOES THIS!!!!!  I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't like spicy foods or may be allergic to cayenne pepper.",

First of all the restaurant closes and the side tavern stays open serving the same delicious food from the restaurant! So, we arrived  (there's plenty of parking by the way) and noticed the restaurant was closed, but someone came out of the tavern and said the tavern side is still open, so don't be discouraged!  We walked in, and was attended immediately by a very friendly waitress. We asked for suggestions and the told us the most popular items, so we took her suggestion and had the \"Mini Duck Tacos\" & \"Mediterranean Dip Sampler\" for starters. The tacos were amazing, so beware! You will probably be making more than one order! Afterwards we ordered a New York Style Pizza! It was surprisingly tasty and very delicious but then again all pizza is tasty and delicious lol... Reasonable prices for great food and a variety of food at that! Inside the tavern you can also sit at the bar and play video poker if you wish, I was more into the sit down table. Restrooms are clean and maintained. Overall, Sammy's Woodfired pizza and grill was a hit!",

A little pricey for its size...but very good. Great cheese, great sauce and good crust.",

    "text": "Looking at the menu, it seems that Sammy's either can't decide what type of food they are serving, or they are trying to copy the popular dishes from a dozen different restaurants.  Tapas, Lettuce wraps, Tacos, Hummus? I thought this was a pizza joint, but there are mostly non-pizza items on the menu.  It's nice to see gluten free and dairy free pizza options on the menu, but they charge way too much for it here. The personal pizzas are around $13, but if you want GF/DF it will be $5 extra. Apparently Sammy's thinks people with allergies should pay 40% more than everyone else.  The gluten free crust is not made in house, it's a very thin premade crust. Worse, they don't even know how to fire it. My pizza was soggy in the center, it flopped over and the toppings fell off when I picked up a piece.  $18 for this small soggy pizza is steep, even if it is gluten and dairy free.  I make a far better gluten free pizza at home. Even Whole Foods can make a better gluten and dairy free pizza, at less than half the price of Sammy's.  A redeeming factor is the Daiya cheese, it's awesome and pretty much impossible to screw up. Even if you eat dairy you will probably love this stuff.  The waitress recommended \"Kobe\" beef sliders to my friend, and assured her that the fries were fresh cut when asked. The sliders tasted like average low grade beef, lacked seasoning, and were overcooked (she ordered medium rare but there was no trace of pink inside). The fries were clearly frozen, definitely not fresh cut. Maybe the waitress didn't know, or maybe she flat out lied about the fries being fresh cut. Either way it was a disappointment.  Left feeling like I overpaid for mediocre food, got price gouged because of allergies, and food was misrepresented by the waitress.  Another reviewer @Tim D. put it perfectly, I wasn't hungry when I left, but I wasn't terribly happy about that. Pretty much sums it up for me.",

    "text": "We were in the area, very hungry and  both pretty excited there was a Sammy's  close by. I don't have many choices because of my gluten intolerance but Sammy's has GF options.  My husband and I ordered the exact same pizza's as we did at the N Durango location and they didn't taste anything like the ones we had there.   They both were under cooked, the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. It just didn't taste like it held the same standards as that location. I've only eaten at the N Durango location and that set the bar pretty high and this didn't even come close.   It wasn't even worth asking them to remake it, or put it back in the oven, because I don't believe they could have done any better than what they served us. Needless to say I walked out hungry and slightly grumpy that I wasted my money.   It has a casino/bar and restaurant you can sit and order at and I normally don't like to sit in the \"smoking\" section but the hubby wanted to gamble and we were the only ones in there so I that's where we ate. Bartenders were nice and very personable.I ordered the cucumber cooler (i think)  and it was about as delicious as the food.  I've raved about the Durango & 95 location. Now I know that each location could be different from the next, so keep that in mind.  I would just be leery of this Sammy's. It's close to the strip and has that casino bar feel and It really does lack quality, but don't use this location to judge the rest.",

    "text": "This is my first review for this branch of Sammy's.  We've been here many times before, so it's unfortunate for them that I chose to review it this time.  The last few visit to Sammy's have been at their Centennial and Flamingo locations, and I raved about it.  This time wasn't such a fortuitous event.    We shared one of their Tapas appetizers, the hummus with kobe beef, and that was fabulous.  It came with triangles of seasoned pita that stayed crisp to the end, and we sure did finish every drop of the hummus.  We followed it up with our standard - The Thai chicken salad.  The last time we had this was at the Centennial Sammy's, and it was so big we couldn't finish it.  This time it was skimpy, with half the amount of chicken, and not enough of the greens for us to be fully satisfied, and I'm not a big eater.  There used to be two sizes of this salad, but it was changed before we had it at Centennial, so it's definitely not a case of us having ordered a larger size last time.  When we commented to the waiter (our waitress seemed to have disappeared and he was the only one working the room), he asked if we wanted to change it for something else.  We didn't.  It was late, and we'd already gone through most of it, which wasn't hard to do this time.  He then asked my husband if he'd like another beer.  It sure sounded as if he were comping it as a result of our negative comment, but when he brought the bill, there was the charge for that second beer!!  He did remove it, but it seemed to go hand in hand with the indifferent and unfriendly service that took over when our waitress split.  This Sammy's is a bit closer to our house than the others, and is usually more convenient when we're on our way back from the Strip or environs, but next time we'll have to rethink it.",

    "text": "Sammy's had a little bit of everything delicious. If I want to split a pie, if I want a delicious salad, or I can't decided on one dish, I can get a few tapas.  My last trip, I sat outside on the patio. A beautiful 70 degree day in January isn't wasted on me. I came starving and glanced over the menu. My lunch mates were also craving everything, so we settled on a few tapas and a pizza.  We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Cups, Mini Duck Tacos, and Parmesan Crusted Artichokes. The lettuce cups were flavorful and light. I didn't care too much for the duck tacos, but my girlfriend loved them, and she devoured the rest of mine, my favorite was the artichoke. They were deep-fried and came with a yummy sauce. Indulgent and sinful. My favorite of the entire meal.   The pizza we ordered was the Sun-Dried Tomato (Artisan crust) which was topped with goat cheese, pine nuts, and basil. Me, oh my. This was a very nontraditional pie and the flavors were fresh and bold. The pine nuts added a fun crunch twist, usually reserved for just the crust. I would order this again and again.  Being fatty patties, we ordered the salted caramel pudding which is pretty much sex in glass. ORDER IT! I only state that sternly because it's like crack (addictive) and I need other people to understand/feel my pain.  Sammy is a great bet for those with different dietary needs. The have an assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free goodies. Service is always attentive. It's a quiet, relaxed atmosphere. This particular location has a bar that is open 24/7 and offers the same menu.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here on a weekday for lunch.  We were seated promptly. There was no wait. The dining room was three quarters empty. It has little decor and ambiance. Very plain. Nothing special to speak of. There's a mix of tables and booths, and bar seating.   Our server, Alexandra B., came to the table fairly quickly. She asked if we'd like drinks. Husband ordered water. and I asked for water, a glass of Leaping Horse chardonnay, and a side of ice. My wine was $6.50 a glass and was very good. Full flavored and very drinkable. Alexandra forgot to bring my side of ice. I had to ask her for it again.   We were expecting that a place that has \"pizza\" in their name would have a bigger array of pizza and do pizza well. We had visions of sharing a big \"Supreme\" pizza and taking some home. Not possible at Sammy's. They only have individual pizzas. So with our dreams of sharing a Supreme pizza and having great leftovers for the next day squashed, my husband ordered an \"Italian\" personal pizza which had pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms on it. You get one big piece of pepperoni on each \"slice\" of pizza. The mushrooms were very sparse. Hubby said it needed more of them. He said the pizza was \"fair\".  I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. It looked beautiful. I was happy, seeing this bright, beautiful salad with its array of vegetables including the surprise of green bell pepper, which you don't often see in this type of salad.  However, with my first bite, I was disappointed. The dressing that was tossed throughout the salad was bland, boring, and didn't have enough Asian flavors. One of the great things about this salad, if done right, is the tangy, full-of-flavor Asian dressing on it. Flavors of soy and ginger are usually in the forefront. Not so with this one. It tasted like oil and vinegar and not much else. I think I detected a hint of soy and less so, ginger, but I'm not sure. I had to look hard to find the chicken. there were a few unevenly sized pieces throughout, some of them a little too charred, with black areas covering a big part of a few pieces. The chicken was also dry. I ate four or five bites and just couldn't eat anymore. It was pretty tasteless.  We ordered dessert. Hubby decided on the Messy Sundae. Our server said it was \"big enough for four people\". He decided to try it anyway. The sundae was pretty \"monster\". It was big but would it feed four? Depending upon how much lunch you ate, and what your appetite is like, it might. I'd describe it as \"feeds 1-4\". It came served in a tall glass goblet  and was filled with vanilla ice cream, and had chocolate sauce not only all over the ice cream but on the saucer that the goblet was on. It was topped with walnuts and a large amount of whipped cream. There were more walnuts in the chocolate sauce on the plate. Hubby really enjoyed the sundae. I decided to try the Caramel Pudding since I love caramel. It was served in a small wine glass and the pudding filled the glass halfway. It was topped with a small amount of whipped cream. The pudding was creamy and rich and full of caramel flavor. The only thing that would've improved it was if there had been more of it! I really enjoyed it.  Alexandra was cheerful, efficient, and checked back on us a couple of times.    To sum up, we were not impressed with our entrees at all. We know of several other places that do pizza, and Chinese Chicken Salad, much better than this. Sammy's is a 20 min drive from home. We wouldn't come back here again unless we happened to be in the neighborhood already, and then we would stop in for just dessert and a glass of chardonnay. :)",

They do tend to get really swamped during lunch time at the Sahara and Flamingo location by businessmen.  They have amazing happy hour pricing between 3pm- 6pm.    I'm just gonna lay out a list of good tapas there.  The mini duck tacos,  the coconut shrimp skewers, chicken lettuce cups, mac & cheese, and the hummus is yum!  My favorite pizza is the truffle & brie pizza.  It's crispy, thin crusted, layered with melted brie cheese and mushrooms and truffle oil.  It's a nice change in taste compared to the usual mozarella cheeses used in pizza.  I added prociutto to it sometimes if I'm feeling a little carnivorous.   The salads are always ice cold and fresh.  You can't go wrong with the Caesar Salad served with grilled chicken breast.  The romaine lettuce is always ice cold all the times I've had it, and its's served with dressing is savory & tangy.  The Chilled Roasted Vegatable Salad is definitely is my favorite guilt-free salad.  It has edamame, tomatoes, mozarella pearls, spinach, drizzled with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar.   If you haven't tried this place out...you're missing out.",

I did a doordash order recently, and the only dish that was edible was the chicken in a balsamic salad with walnuts, the addition of an extra 6 walnuts cost me $1.20 on a $18 order   I had the lobster bisque, besides the teeny tiny 4oz cup of soup, about 1/4 of it was added salt. had to pour in almost 1/2 milk to make it edible. Same with the tomato Basil soup, salty as can be. YUCK!!   I had spaghetti bolognese, also loaded with salt to hide the flavorless tomato sauce. Another $18 dish.  maybe they should stick to pizza.",

The salad was ridiculously delicious and nourishing. The staff was so accommodating to a table of 8 people! We stayed and talked for maybe 2 hours, and they never once got antsy with us, and continued to fill up our waters and drinks.   Head up if you check in via YELP you can get a free messy sundae, drizzled in chocolate!! The sundae was freaking delicious, and we scarfed it down. Will definitely consider this place again when visiting LV.",

If it's late and you're out clubbing read the bottom of my review.   What a treat! I had the organic arugula and pears pizza, the hummus with grilled herb flatbread, and a passion fruit iced tea (boring-a nice wine would have been fantastic with the pizza!)  I have been wanting to come here for more than two years. But, I must admit, my palate isn't that extensive and I am very simple. The typical Budweiser man! Anyways. The hummus was incredible, it was beyond your typical simple recipe, it had depth and the flavors were ever changing; the grilled flatbread added to my incredible experience as the evoo and herbs mixed in. The dish itself is plenty for four. I don't wish to compare, but, this is the best hummus I have had in Las Vegas. Sorry my friends, this is the BEST.   The organic arugula and pears pizza was a big winner with me. It was a great deal more than these two ingredients. I recognized the cheese, however, it escaped my mind at the moment. It also had an interesting ham sliced throughout. It was delicious and the flavors went well with each other. My mother and I once ate at an Argentinean restaurant in Mexico and we had a similar dish. I cannot wait to bring mom here so she can experience this with me. The restaurant is very nice and perfect for a date, perfect for a family celebrating a special event, perfect for the boss to celebrate the quarter results, perfect for a \"the club just closed, but, I still want to do something.\" Well, next to the restaurant is their Tavern 6500 which is open 24/7 and they serve some of the same delicious food. You're welcome!",

Staff: Our waiter was Brandon, we love him. He was very sweet and helpful. He gave good recommendations on the menu, he also took pictures for us multiple times.  Taco: we love the duck meat, we weren't expecting the duck could be this tasty.   Mini wagyu burger: the beef was super juicy. I got one bite and the meat juicy just drizzling down my chin. The veggies are fresh, and I'll asked them to upgrade my fries to be parmesan fries.   Lemon drop martini: this is probably the best martini that I ever had. One cup of it makes me relax. I might come here more often just for the happy hours to get a cup of martini.  Downside: the kitchen messed up my friend's order for shrimp pasta. My friend was purposely asking no chicken in the pasta. Next thing we knew there were some tiny chicken meats hidden under the pasta. My friend can't have chicken and she stayed away from it for more than 10 years.  The manager came to our table and apologized, she removed the item from the check and gave us a number to call back, and we knew Brandon didn't messed up the order, the kitchen did.   Overall: we were here to celebrate someone's birthday, it's little bit awkward when we had to confront about the issue, other than that, everything was amazing. Four stars.",

The main restaurant is modesty sized with fairly generic interior decor.  Staff were pretty friendly, and the server and her trainee were pretty attentive and check on the table and brought drink refills when needed without being asked.  I went for the oak grilled chicken which is two large chicken breasts with a balsamic glaze and brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes.   The chicken was hot and juicy, and the portion was large especially at lunch.  The potatoes and brussels sprouts were also pretty good.  It believe the entree was about $17 which seemed reasonable for the portion size.  They have a large menu with a ton of dishes besides pizza.  Overall this was a perfectly decent meal though nothing particularly spectacular set it apart from other casual eateries.",

We asked if they could be omitted, our server went to the kitchen to ask. When she came back, she said that the pizza toppings for this particular one were \"premixed\" and could not be changed. That was a little disappointing to hear. What else is \"premixed\" here? But we ordered the pizza anyways and picked off the green peppers. As as far as gluten free pizzas go, it was alright. The garlicky flavor went very well with crust.  I do like that they serve iced tea in pitchers. I drink through that stuff like nothing.",

My boyfriend had chicken, i had steak. Fresh and perfectly cooked (no freezer-rubbery meat here). Their potatoes? I have no clue what they do to them but SO good. Green beans were fresh too! No squeaky freezer beans! They were a little oily but i didnt care because they were so good! So pleasantly surprised to find a delicious stop when we only stopped in on a whim! Great quality food we were not expecting from a 24 hour bar!",

    "text": "This time I strayed away from my usual Hummus and Thai Salad. Those items are both delicious but I figured it was called Sammy's Woodfired Pizza for a reason. I can't let all this time pass and not try the pizza right?   The pizza here isn't huge... they are a little bigger than a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut. Sammy's gives you some healthy options for the crust you can either get wheat crust for a dollar more or gluten free for I think $3.00 dollars more. I opted for the wheat crust because I'm not sure what health benefits gluten free would have on me. I'm not used to making healthy choices but I try...sometimes. I was afraid the crust would be hard and stale but it was very fresh and fluffy inside. My topping for my order was Mozzarella with fresh basil. The cheese was nice and gooey like gum which in my book is a good thing!   It was a chilly day so I also ordered a bowl of Lobster Bisque soup. This is my first time having it and I was happy that it had a creamy texture. There were little bits of lobster in it and it didn't leave a weird after taste in my mouth. It was pretty tasty!   My husband and I shared the Warm Crispy Donuts which were served with a side of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce. They melted in your mouth especially with the addicting dipping sauces!",

Editing my review to reflect that the manager reached out to explain that the waitress lied about the ability to split the check for us.

    "text": "Sammy's at Sahara is a relaxing, comfortable place for happy hours: 4-6pm AND Midnight-8am!  - It also has a smoke-free, 24-hr Tavern!  Before coming to this Sahara location, my wife and I had visited another Sammy's by Durango/Elkhorn and we loved it (separate review). I am glad to report that this Sahara locale also has all the niceties typical of Sammy's. It has the same great HH menu with $2 off drinks and half price tapas, and excellent service! Although its patio has only a view of the parking lots, it does have a charming fire pit. The restaurant has an impressive building exterior; a nice entrance through the patio; a comfortable bar counter and 2 wings of small dining areas. Next to one side of the dining room is its famous 24-hr Tavern.  MY HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE: - Per fellow Yelpers' good recommendations, I dropped by this nice place 2days ago for early happy hour, and had a delightful experience.  As expected, since it was a Monday, the place was not crowded, with only a few tables of guests.  - Thinking out loud: If they extend the happy hours to 7pm (like Gordon Biersch, Kona Grill, Embers, and Chicago Brewing Co.), it might draw more people coming after work.  Here, I enjoyed, once again, the pork dumplings (3.50), and mini duck tacos (5.25), a beer (3) and a cab (5), all of them just as tasty as those served at the other Sammy's! Being by myself this time, though, I couldn't get all my favorite dishes. Sigh! I had to pass up the garlic cheese flat bread and the lettuce cups! Would have been even nicer with more people to share and sample more temptations! My bill came to a reasonable $18 (plus tips). Not bad!  The waitress was very friendly. But she was working all alone for our section, so was not too attentive, though adequate. One of the managers (Jeff?) was helping her out, though, which is a mark of excellence for management. Another friendly lady manager (Heather) also dropped by at various tables to chat a little with customers. Both managers were super pleasant, making customers feel welcome. They pointed out to me the unique features of this particular locale, such as the reverse happy hour (midnight-8am) and its 24-hr Tavern, which is supposed to be smoke-free, too.   - Yah, I'm putting this locale on my own \"List of Favorite Bars in the Summerlin Neighborhood Area for Happy Hours\"!

I had to stop a different server twice to ask him for refills. When she was sat a second table we were completely ignored, all together. I had to get up to ask for my check. Then a third server helped me, she offered to get the manager for me. I did decline to speak to the manager. (Even though she had only checked on us once.) It was late & I needed to get the family home. However she insisted, so I spoked to him. The whole time it was blatantly obvious that Lexi was trying to hear everything I was saying.  I don't plan on returning to that location, anytime soon. However, if I do I will definitely be making sure I get a different server.",

It was tender, juicy, & delicious! Outside of that item, nothing popped out at me since I was not in the mood for pizza. Which btw the way they have GREAT pizza & you can see it being made.

I personally like the \"New York\" pizza and have never been disappointed.  I have also had the balsamic chicken salad a few times and it is also good, but not as good on the good scale as the pizza.  Where they fall short, starters and appetizers.  Because the individual pizza is filling, I usually stay away from the appetizers and starter items.  However, today I was in the mood for something new.  It was raining so I figured it was a good soup day.  I ordered Lobster Bisque - VERY tasty but $8 bucks for a small sized bowl.  I also thought some of the parmesan crusted artichokes sounded good.  Nope, they were not good and they were $10 for basically one artichoke heart cut into 4 pieces.  I felt a little violated here.    Service is always adequate - never bad but never anything above and beyond and that's ok with me too.  I would recommend this place for the pizza and because it's very good, I gave the 4 stars.  I would have only given 3 stars otherwise.",

You'd be better off ordering pizza and just not eating the crust if you're GF (which my husband does sometimes). And they charge you extra for making it GF :(   We also ordered salad & an appetizer & a couple desserts.

    "text": "As you can see from my previous review, I am definitely a fan of Sammy's Wood-fired Pizza. Love the franchise. However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.   I went there for lunch a couple of days ago because I was craving their delicious vegan cheese pizza, add pineapples. It was somewhat busy, but not over-crowded. Although our server was very friendly, service in itself left something(s) to the imagination. I ordered their hummus as an appetizer which never made an appearance. The pineapples from my pizza were absent, but the bug in my boyfriend's drink was very present. For some reason, our pizzas just didn't taste as good that day which greatly saddened us.   Who knows? Maybe it was an off day for them. I think I'll just stick with the Sammy's on Sunsent in Hendes from here on out though.",

I did hear that its a chain pizza spot affiliated or owned by CPK?  Go figure why i liked it.  My doc at worked ordered it for lunch.  Thai, mozzarella, veggies, bbq were the four types of pizza they got.  The thai pizza was good, but there were whole peanuts in it.  It was okay.  Maybe I would like it if it was half of it sprinkled on top.  The texter made it real crunchy. LOL!  The veggie was my favorite.    The salad's lettuce were chopped up (love my salads this way) with chicken. The problem was the dressing was just so tart! I almost teared!  Next time for sure I have to dine in.",

I'm totally in love with their fish taco entree, the mini duck taco appetizer, lobster mac and cheese and the greek salad. I love coming here in the evenings and finding a seat outside by the fire pit. The inside dining room is nice too and rather lounge-y versus diner-y. Happy hour is great here for the 1/2 price apps and drink specials. And one in awhile I'll find a buy one get one coupon in an Entertainment guide and I'll rush down to this restaurant to use it.",

    "text": "I have to admit to being a regular at this Sammy's.  All of the restaurants have the same menu, but over the past three years of eating at four Sammy's in Vegas, this one has become my favorite for lunch, while the Rainbow location remains my happy hour spot.  Why the difference?  It all comes down to the staff.  The lunch crew at Sahara is dialed in to their customers and handles the rush in stride.  Mojca, Albert, Sam, and Tia all do a  terrific job, even at the busiest times.  The guys in the kitchen turn out consistently fresh and impressive entrees; particularly the salads.  Christina runs a tight shop and it shows up in the great food and service.  Happy hour let's you graze through  a wide variety of half- price tapas that reinforce Sammy's Lebanese heritage.  I've had many a dinner of just these tasty items at Aaron's Rainbow location and if there's a \"Cheers\" equivalent in my world, this is it.  Excellent food, a wide variety and friendly, caring employees.  Hard to hit this trifecta in Vegas.",

This place looks like a good spot for lunch with a few coworkers but not exactly the best spot for families with children. We stood awkwardly at the front waiting For a table for for 8. Didn't seem like that much to ask for but we waited at least 10 minutes just to be crammed in with a bunch of other tables. I ordered the mahi fish tacos for $13 and wondered why we didn't just go to red lobster, I had no idea this place was so expensive. My friend got an artichoke pizza and said it was great. My fish tacos were pretty good as well. The other guests got burgers with no complaints either. I only gave 2 stars because the staff was artificially friendly. I didn't get sincere customer service that I always expect anywhere I go, not to mention at a pricey joint. The waiter was quick to try to get you another beer, but non existent when you needed a water or soda refil. If I were going to lunch with my boss and he were paying, I'd come again.",

But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience.",

    "text": "Tl;Dr- service sucks, it's pretty much non-existent, but food is okay   Since I knew I was coming here, I signed up the day before for the e-club and got a coupon for a free pizza, with a purchase that is equal to or greater than the price of the pizza.   I came here with a few ladies after work. It was after 7 so we missed the happy hour which is daily from 4-6. I was surprised they don't have cocktails, only beer and wine. We ordered the balsamic chicken salad and the red quinoa salad, and the organic arugula and pear pizza on a gluten free crust (+$4). The balsamic chicken salad is one of my favorites, it is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. It has grilled chicken, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and greens mixed together with a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. The mild cheese with the tangy dressing work so well together, the flavors make my taste buds do a little dance. The pizza had gorgonzola, arugula, pears and prosciutto. I thought it was too salty for my liking, with the salty cheese and prosciutto, but my friends ate it all up.   Our server was the worst. He was nice and all, but he forgot to bring us utensils, water and extra napkins after we asked him numerous times. I eventually had to grab utensils off the other tables and find my own napkins, not cool.  After dinner, we ordered the messy sundae to share. It comes in a large glass cup, with vanilla ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces and whipped cream. When it arrived at our table, we grabbed our spoons and dug right in. This proved not to be an easy task though. The ice cream was as hard as a rock, so we had to wait like 10 minutes for it to soften up so we could eat it. I assume they pre-scoop the ice cream into a glass cup and then freeze it, which probably saves time, but sucked for us. I really LOVE that balsamic chicken salad and that is honestly the only thing that keeps me coming back here.",

My Hubby and I both opted for pizza although some of the other items certainly sounded enticing.   That was pretty much the extent of our enjoyable experience. My Hubby asked for no onions on his pizza and, yep, he got onions. Lots of red onion. Since our server seemed a bit scattered, my Husband just picked the onions off. I was also hoping for another cocktail but, again, the server seemed oblivious to our table so I just nursed my glass of water. Once we finished eating we waited for the bill and a box for our left overs. And we waited. Not sure why we were waiting so long as it really wasn't busy-- at all. So, needless to say, I got up and asked the hostess for a box & our bill. After boxing up our leftover pizza we waited for the server to finish ringing up our bill so we could sign the copy and head out... and again we waited. The server finally walked by but in a flurry so I had to basically yell at him to get his attention so we could finalize our bill.   Unfortunately, the poor service completely negated any enjoyment from the actual meal. So, we won't be returning especially where it was pretty far out of our way anyhow.",

The reviews mainly mentioned the pizza so I am not aware of the authenticity or the quality of many other offerings at Sammy's, but I will need to come back and try another meal.  This restaurant is very close to me house so I really hope I can find something to my liking next time I happen to stop in.

We wanted to go here after our hike, because we were pretty impressed by some of the food we had on our previous experiences here. They had a pot de creme was that was heavenly and a slider that was on point.  Since we had our dog with us, we decided to call and see if they let dogs eat on the patio.  Me: \"Excuse me, do you guys allow small dogs on your patio?\" Sammy's Employee: \"Yes! Of course, it shouldn't be a problem.\"  Well it was a problem.  We arrived and was greeted not by someone asking if they could help us, but someone who wanted to tell us our dog was not allowed. And rather than having it be a conversation to get clarity on their policy (because after all we just called) -- he said that \"Sammy's was a restaurant and dogs weren't allowed to eat on the patio because it was a health violation.\"  Hmmm...  Well how does Lazy Dog Restaurant in Summerlin stay compliant? I saw enough dogs on their patio to merit a shelter.  Thanks, Sammy -- but no thanks. Am totally willing to abide by your policy (whatever you decide that it is) but not willing to be treated rudely or have wanting to get some food from your place be entirely inconvenient.",

I've been to 4 other locations before and this one was probably the smallest and simplest one, with only a few booths and mostly table seating. They also have a few tables on the patio if you like to eat outside.  I ordered the usual must have mini duck tacos and decided to try a prosciutto pizza. The duck tacos were wonderful and I was happy to be able to get the sauce on the side. the pizza was fresh and crispy and had a nice kick of garlic that wasn't too overpowering.  The waitress was friendly, but maybe overly so because she responded to many of my questions or requests with playfully sarcastic remarks. I would return to this location to grab a bite but it doesn't seem like the place to lounge around like the Centennial and Green Valley locations are.",

I sent it back but apparently the waitress insisted the soup I \"really\" wanted was the lobster bisque soup\" I told her I don't like lobster so I can assure you I know my what soup iv'e been ordering for the last 3 years,  According to the cook the soup hasn't changed since 2001 that what he told her. Oh please give me break I use to come to Sammy's strictly for the basil soup and it's not the same!  So my next course of meal I ordered which was  Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken tasted like it was 3 week old salad with saggy chicken! Nasty! I will never go again! Sadly Sammy's on Sahara is no longer a place for good food and good service.",

I've heard of this place but have never ate here. It was busy with the normal lunch time crowd when we arrived,  but luckily we had a reservation.   We were free to order anything (but alcohol) off the menu,  so I ordered the wagyu cheeseburger with caramelized onions and a side of fries.  Having never tried high quality Japanese beef, I was super excited. The burger was really good! Cooked well done on a sesame seed toasted bun with lettuce, tomato, and the onions. Fantastic.",

Along with the gift card, I signed up for their E-Club where I immediately received a coupon for a Bogo pizza. A fantastic deal, in my opinion.   We ended up getting two pizzas and an appetizer.   The app was a Mediterranean Dip Trio. It included Hummus, baba ghanoush, and Lebni cheese. My favourite out of the three was the baba ghanoush. The hummus was also good, but the Lebni cheese just tasted like a really lemony sour cream. Of course, this was my first time having Lebni cheese, so I can't compare it to others elsewhere. I'm not saying it was bad, just not as good as the others on the trio platter.   The two pizzas we got were the Goat cheese pizza and the Burrata and Pesto pizza. Both were good. My boyfriend preferred the Burrat and Pesto, but I preferred the Goat cheese.   The pizzas aren't large. They are about the size of a large dinner plate. We ended up taking leftovers home. Not a whole lot, but a few slices of pizza.   Overall, our experience was a good one. The food is decent and the menu has a LOT of variety.  Our waitstaff was also very pleasant and constantly smiling. Will we come back? Not sure. It was good but not anything special. Perhaps during happy hour?",

She kept attending to a larger party I guess because it was just my husband and I she assumed we wouldn't tip as much. Little did she know I believe in big tipping. I asked her hello excuse me, can I please have more water. When she brought the water she stated \" here you go\" and stormed off. She was attending to the large party. And I felt a little bad for butting in on whatever they were asking about but I was almost at the point of choking. I'm sorry to say she was a horrible waitress. Long day but it's not my fault. Food excellent but waitress Adrienne was very much rude. .",

Now I'm not a dramatic person but you can only imagine how someone feels when they realize they are eating something with a bug in it. I took a video which I will post for people to see! I called the restaurant calmly and let them know what happened. The guy on the phone told me he would let the chef know to look out for bugs in food....uhh wait, what?! I was baffled when I got off the phone. An hour later a lady called me and apologized and asked if I could email the video to her which I immediately did, and guess what. No response! No one even even called me or emailed back! I get things happens but at least make a decent amount of effort to apologize and make things right. I was not even offered a refund for the salad that was in the trash, I think that is the LEAST  they could do.  At this point I don't even care if anyone reaches out which I think is unlikely.... people should just really look at their food before eating from this place. t. I have had an upset stomach since yesterday! I can't even get over it. Good luck to anyone dining here.",

The tapas menu is pretty intriguing as well.   I decided on the Lobster Mac & Cheese, which was about $5. It was the perfect amount. Considering it is a pasta so it's pretty heavy I decided not to get another item for myself. It had a good amount of Lobster in it. It wasn't TOO cheesy. And the dish wasn't as small as I thought it would be.   The beau got the garlic chicken pizza. Besides the fact that it came with mushrooms and I accidentally ate one, it was pretty delicious. I loath mushrooms! It definitely had a woodfire taste to it. It was thin crust which I loved.   Service was alright. She came and got our orders quickly but we didn't see our waitress the rest of the time. And our check took forever to arrive. Other than that I love Sammy's!",

    "text": "Holy happy hour specials, Batman! Bookmarked this place for their HH: 4-6PM, half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer.  Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected. Menu is fairly diverse with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options indicated with symbols. Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options, there are a bunch of salads, and of course, there's pizza- if you join their mailing list, you'll get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only, with purchase).  BF and I were here for a light early dinner, got 3 tapas and a beer. FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD: Yum, 4-slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs, salty cheese, and mild spinach, as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch. PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES: Good lord these were the table favorite, served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce. 'Chokes had crunch and flavor, herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside, which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere). DUCK MINI TACOS: An order of 6 mini tacos, filled with 24-hour-marinated duck topped with cilantro, tomatoes, feta, and sour cream, HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs. I never would have combined duck and feta, but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish. Fresh and flavorful!  Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service: entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged, and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled. This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present, but I guess maybe they weren't on the clock yet? As 6 o'clock got closer, business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack. Normally I'd dock a star for this, but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly, and was amazing.  Fabulous food, phenomenal happy hour.  Even with a beer, total before tip was under $20. Will be coming back to try more!",

I usually come here during my work day to grab lunch with a fellow yelper and we are always happy with the service, food and that we can be in and out in an hour.   They have great lunch specials for between $9-14 along with a huge menu of anything you can think of!  I love their Chinese chicken salad and the chicken garlic pizza is delicious! The salad is huge and can easily be split between two people. The pizzas at Sammys are coated on the bottom of the crust in cornmeal before throwing it in the wood fired oven so it added and extra crunch.   I usually order the lunch blackened chicken over a bed a warmed kale with lentils and tomato soup. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the salad has a light lemon dressing without any oil so it's tasty without being fattening. The soup is over two cups worth and isn't the normal small side cup of soup servers with lunches.   Sammy's is a good place for groups who can't decide what to order and don't want to spend an arm and a leg for it.",

They have an outside seating as well and a full bar with happy hour specials. 6500 Tavern gaming room is next door.  They have small plates like Tapas, soups, salad, tacos and ofcourse pizza. I had the Thai pizza and tried the Thai satay. Thai  Shrimp woodfire pizza- I liked the combination of ingredients: julienned vegetables, scallions, cilantro, peanuts, lime juice, fresh mint, and spicy Thai peanut sauce. The pizza was ok, no complain.  I did prefer the Thai Chicken Satays more like my style. It is served with spicy peanut ginger sauce and the chicken was tender.  The service was great. The place was nice and clean.   You can get a 20% discount if you are LVAC member.  I would love to sit outside near the fire pit. Once I left and after a few hours my head and nose was stuffy due to the smoke cigarette. I am not used to it. This just happens to me at another place if the place is an old establishment, I think the smoke exhaust does not work that well. If I come back, I am def. sitting outside.",

Despite the fact that the sole bartender was running both the bar and lounge area we received really great service.  He greeted us immediately upon sitting down and provided great service throughout the meal.  Our beers were comp'd for play and the pizza was quite good; we had the New York Style with mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage.  The pizza size is plenty to share if you have a salad or an app.  There's also a touch-tunes machine in the bar that you can use to play your own music for 50c per song.",

I am leaving it at 4-stars because I am sure the food is still the same; however, I wouldn't exactly know because the past two times I have visited, I have left without anything to eat. On the first visit, I wasn't too hungry, but it was after midnight, and when we walked into the 24-hour tavern, I was so disappointed to smell the stench of smoke. Yes, they now allow smoking, and on that night, I didn't want to deal with the smoke while eating. Round two: It is after 11pm, but I am okay with dealing with smoke because I am starving and an arugula pizza sounds divine. However, after sitting at a table for at least 10 minutes, the only interaction was a bartender telling us it was a shift change and someone would be with us in a minute while he proceeded to clear tables, restock ice and take his closing tables checks, so after those 10 minutes, I left. I was just too hungry. All of this to say: snooze on their 24-hour tavern. (See previous update for reference.) Stick to the main squeeze. I can't imagine we will keep this on our 24-hour dining options after the past two visits.",

    "text": "Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we  Probably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!",

It kind of angered me they did not get a table ready for us.  Even after they all arrived they still did not get a table ready, they just sat us all at three seperated places near each other.  I moved from the bar, to a table then moved again to another table still in the same party and I could tell the servers were getting mad.  Really it wouldn't have been a problem if they had just prepared a table for us all in the first place.  Though I shouldn't really complain all of our drinks were re-filled constantly and another server (which was not ours) hid and served a birthday cake for the guest of honor.  The restaraunt smelled great and the food was decent but I doubt I'd come here again.",

Last nite, the 3 of us had 6 glasses of wine, 4 tapas dishes & mini donuts (not part of hh but so delish!) for $57. If I rated just last nite's experience, it'd get 3 stars, due to a major service issue where we were seated then not so much as even looked at for 10min. To my dismay, I had to be kind of a jerk to get someone to acknowledge us. But, from there, our waitress was very attentive & even checked on us right before 6 to see if we wanted more wine/tapas before hh ended. I give the sum of all our experiences there a strong 4 stars, though. All of the tapas items are very tasty. Going directly from our respective offices, we like the convenient location. Plus, it's not a wild happy hour that we'll be paying for at work the following day. There's plenty of room for those shenanigans but sometimes it's nice to just meet up with friends, talk without yelling & put down the cocktails for a glass or two of wine.",

    "text": "i went here for lunch today with my boyfriend. the service was good, and worthy of a good tip. the food on the other hand was not what i had expected. strange, because we've gone here in the past and really enjoyed our experience.  we ordered duck tacos and lettuce wraps to start. to drink i ordered a hefeweizen and my boyfriend ordered the tenaya creek local draft which we both enjoyed. everything about the duck tacos was amazing except the duck. it was dry and mostly tasteless. the lettuce wraps were alright, like every other lettuce wrap i've had but a little on the salty side. then we ordered a tuscan pizza and a sicilian pizza to share. both were good, but i thought the tuscan was wayyyy too salty. i'm almost positive it was the olives. for dessert we ordered the fudgy sundae.... it came to us in a wine glass on a plate sans the fudge. instead, it was a nasty corn syrupy chocolate sauce (the kind you squirt out of a bottle) that poured over the side of the glass and covered the plate, which was really unappetizing to me. the brownie in it wasn't actually a brownie but these cookie-like pieces. not at all what i had anticipated for $8.50.  all in all i felt that for the 60 bucks we paid, the food was sub par. i'm sure we'll go back again, but we'll definitely be trying something that hopefully contains a little less sodium. i think i give up on the desserts from here, they only have 5 things to choose from anyway.",

I know its a chain, but its regional, and has some history in Las Vegas. This is one of the few places we take out of towners, and one of the few places where my family of very picky eaters can all get something they like. My top 3 favorite things about Sammy's are: 1) The pizza...everyone I get is great but the Margarita pizza is my fave. 2) The tapas...I judge all other edamame by  Sammy's standards. I also love their mac & cheese. 3) Salads...they have beautiful and delicious salads. Additionally, I've never had bad service (at this location or the Sunset location) and I like that the menu's differ by location. I didn't realize this until we hit the Sunset location with my brother (a creature of habit) and they didn't have his favorite dish from the W. Sahara location. Enough rambling...I am glad I live on the West side of town now, as this is my favorite location of the bunch, and it was the first in Vegas...",

The small bar area of this place is open 24/7 so we stopped in for some half priced tapas (happy hour from midnight to 8am) and to chat with Dave, our friend's friend and an incredibly cool guy that was working the overnight shift.  It was 4am and I didn't want to be stuffed before going to bed, so I only ordered a few dishes.  I had the steak skewers with teriyaki glaze and the garlic cheese bread.  Both were good, but the garlic cheese bread was really good in its garlicy and cheesy-ness.  I also had one of the duck tacos from one of the others' plates and it was decent, but if I got it again I'd get it without the creamy tomato cilantro sauce.  Overall, I'd say the food is worth 3 or 3.5 stars, but Dave's coolness bumps this location up to a solid 4 stars.",

We got there at 6pm right in time for happy hour, 4-7pm. The problem? Happy hour is only in the bar and we really wanted to sit in the restaurant portion. Oh wells... So we sit down at a booth and looked over the menu. The menu looks pretty good and we decided to order two tapas and a woodfired pizza. We order the Hummus with Ground Kobe Beef, Chicken Lettuce Cups, and the LaDou's Barbecue Chicken pizza. Overall the food was pretty good. I would definitely eat here again. The prices were reasonable and the portions likewise. Now if I could only get my hands on some more coupons...",
