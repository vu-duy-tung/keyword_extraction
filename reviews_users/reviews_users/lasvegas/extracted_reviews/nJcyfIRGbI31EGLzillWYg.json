The food unfortunately was slightly better than fast food.  Also,  our server was friendly but the food took awhile to arrive.  This place has the potential to be a Rock and Brews - this Gene Simmons pub which is similar but has much better food and vibe.",

The one constant, is the remaining staff whom I consider long term friends. Three years ago, I decided to move back home to Vegas, and I still visit Circus regularly when able. I return because of the friendly staff, good food, low prices, good gaming, but mostly because I love the atmosphere. It reminds me of old Vegas and it never lost its charm. Without DJ Miguel, DJ DJ, the flair bartenders (too many to mention however, Vince Neil's lost some of the BEST in the city to competition) Susie (cocktail) Bob (the pit), MANY employees in the West Deli... Circus would lose my business and the business I bring into town(I ALWAYS recommend it).   While there will always be a \"prettier\" place to stay and play... Circus and Vince Neils/Rockin Ritas will ALWAYS be my favorite as long as the one constant stays... that is - the staff. They provide awesome customer service, and a place that I can get away and enjoy old friends, gamble, eat, party, sing, dance...and feel at home all at the same time.",

We actually only found out about it as we were coming downstairs and someone was handing out flyers for dinner for 2 for $40.00. I'm so glad we took the flyer. Nothing in Las Vegas is free anymore, but we still were looking for a great bargain. If you are too, go here.   The $40 special was for 2 strip steaks with a veg and a bottle of wine and dessert for 2. Our steaks were prepared perfectly, and our server was really nice. The wine wasn't horrible, and the cheesecake was sooooo good.  They have TV's all around the restaurant, and they offer karaoke on a large stage. The next day, we had jet lag and got a late start. The  Circus Circus hotel has pretty limited choices for food without getting trampled by kids, so we went back to gamble for a few and saw that this restaurant was open for breakfast too. SCORE!!  I had the steak and eggs breakfast for $10 and change and my husband had pancakes for $7. It's not the prettiest of atmospheres for breakfast, but again, the servers were really nice, and you can't beat the price.    All in all, I was really impressed with the place and  what they had to offer.  They have a full, varied menu, speedy and friendly service.  I would go back in  a heart beat.",

    "text": "One of the only places open for a late lunch at Circus Circus, as the buffet closes at 2pm and the pizzeria's line is very long.  The food offerings are generally American - burgers, salads, sandwiches, and there are a few Mexican options (tacos and burritos).  I had the shrimp tacos and I recommend it.  A tad spicy, as there are pieces of jalapenos or peppers hiding under the cabbage and salsa.  There is a fair amount of shrimp in each taco, not just two pieces.  The sauce is zesty, so additional sauce isn't necessary. You get three in an order.  I also tried some of my bf's avocado cheeseburger - juicy and huge.  Those fries are something else!  I'm not sure what it is, but the coating, shape and crunch are not like typical French fries (they kind of remind me of churros - they are dark and shaped more round with sharp edges than square).  This place is loud, with TVs playing music videos from the past, which is kind of neat (you don't see 80's or 90's music videos at restaurants many places nowadays) and nostalgic.  Decor here is Motley Crue instruments, awards and wardrobes, so that's the theme - hair/rock bands.  It looks like there is a stage in the center of the restaurant, so I assume a band or DJ plays/spins on weekend evenings.  Staff is friendly and quick to seat you.  Food is ready fairly quickly and our server, Windy, was attentive to our table.",

We had hotel coupons for breakfast food and I have comp points to pay for food. Now. The breakfast menu is comprised of 2 items. There is a 2x2x2 standard fare eggs, bacon and pancakes  or steak and eggs.  We had steak and eggs. The steak was about a 6 or 7 Oz strip, cooked decently,  my medium order was a bit under cooked, more like med rare, but for me still okay.  The over medium eggs were perfect, the side of potato were averarge, not bad So , all in all decent.  The coffee was hot and fresh and verry good.  The waitress was friendly and okay. A bit slow for service but since she was the only one here, I give her props!!",

So the deal was a bottle of wine with two 8oz steaks for $29!! Yes you heard me right twenty-nine dollas that make you wanna halla!  Most restaurants inside the casino/hotels tend to be a little over-priced especially hen it comes to steak and a bottle of wine. I ordered mine medium well and it came with veggies and french fries and as our wine we selected white wine (we wanted something sweeter). Our steaks arrived and couldn't help to notice the charcoal taste! I said medium well not burnt. However I was very hungry and we had stayed pretty late the night before I did not have the server replace my steak and just dealt with it. Over all from this experience I thought what you buy is what you get, the wine and steak were not all that great but then again I should've figured with that low price. Luckily the service was great and did not feel \"too\" bad coming here all thanks to the service.",

Bartender was terrible she unable to take our party of six, drink and food orders at the same time which caused everyone's drinks and meals to come out at different times. She seemed super flustered but was amusing to watch. It wasn't busy considering there was only 10 people total at the bar and she even had a bar back helping her.  It got really annoying to ask for every little thing like sugar for tea, butter for pancakes, napkins, silverware, missing food and cold food the list goes on and on. For some reason our bill came incorrect, then when the manager came to fix it she said next time if we want the special we need to ask for it specifically and that she would fix it this time. I said look down at the flyer in front of you that's what I handed your bartender. She said oh I'll talk to my staff then. Then I told her all of our problems with the staff and she asked us to write everything we just told her on the back of our receipt. I looked at her like she was an idiot. I'm on vacation I'm not here to write reviews of your staff. I told you the problem now you need to fix it. She told us she would discount our meals 20%, I just laughed.

That's all it took to incapacitate me for the next 36 hours, thankfully my girlfriend's was more fully cooked and didn't get it as bad. I don't know if it was because we arrived on a Sunday at 10pm or if they use leftover steaks for groupon users but it is inexcusable. I've never been so sick and based on the symptoms, I think it might have been salmonella. The only saving grace was the talented karaoke singers. I usually never post reviews but felt it was necessary to warn people of the gamble of eating here. I realize not everyone gets food poisoning here but even one time is too many.",

The fries tasted like they sat under the warming lamp for 10 minutes before our order was placed. definitely not the heat and texture you would expect. the New York steak was full of grisle and tough. The bottle of red wine was Rex Goliath Pinot Noir and even though it was uncorked in front of us it tasted old. I can say that we definitely will never go back",

We stopped in for cocktails and appetizers and were shocked to find that the specialty cocktails are served in plastic cups-a Margarita in a cup? ( Really?! I thought this was a restaurant, but a pool party!) We ordered Drunken Shrimp and Guacamole and chips. The shrimp looked like something you use as bait for bigger shrimp; it wasn't peeled and was overloaded with heat, not spice or flavor. The Guacamole tasted prepackaged or something from Costco. The venue was typical-TV's playing 80's Rock videos were okay, but not of high quality. If you are looking for a better rock-and-roll venue, go to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.",

I was reluctant at first because you don't really know what to expect at face value being a \"rock restaurant in Circus Circus,\" but we got away with 2 Medium Rare NY Strip Steak meals with a bottle of wine and a THICK slice of cheesecake for super cheap! And I don't even think it was one of those \"you get what you pay for\" type of things... it was genuinely good.   There was actually Karaoke there that started toward the end of our visit and it was such a fun atmosphere. The host sang \"Love On The Brain\" by Rihanna... in a country accent. I hate country and even I thought he killed it!   Rachel was very good to us. Really really good service especially considering we came on a groupon I've seen servers give crap service to groupon users elsewhere so I was very thankful they treated us like every other customer.  I recommend.",

Country Fried Steak was worse than something found in a gas station quick grab microwave food section topped, once again, with the same viscous jarred \"gravy\". Apparently anyone can open a restaurant these days. Maybe Vince Neil actually consumes food like this - perhaps the reason he is a bloated, cirrhotic remnant of a rock star but, more than likely, he and his investment partners think the customers patronizing this establishment don't deserve better and are too stupid and star struck to care...this is further evident by the careless misspellings throughout their menu. But, they may be right since it's inexplicably stayed in business for 5yrs. I dare you to prove that anything on the menu, other than maybe the wedge salad, isn't premade and popped in a microwave or dropped in a fryer before being slung on to a plate. Worn out vinyl booth seats, cruddy floors, surly inattentive waitstaff round out one of the worst dining experiences I've had - so bad it bordered on downright insulting.",

Worst part was that it took an hour and 35 minutes for my food to be cooked and sent to me at the bar. This was totally unreal! An hour and 35 minutes to make shrimp tacos and cheesecake? Impossible! Not to mention how absentminded and drunk the bartender was. That's the only way to explain why she couldn't figure out I had ordered food in the first place.

I've kept hoping this place would make improvements to the menu, not so much as of yet.   As a former GM in the industry customer experience should be paramount for repeat business.   There is a entire population of potential customers not being served because there is no accommodation for people with dietary needs such as sugar, or salt restrictions. The food is generally over salted on nearly every item due to marinades, but the excess occurs in the kitchen. Taste the food prior to service!!!!  I have no idea how involved ownership is, but much more is necessary.   My last order was ridiculously over salted, and fortunately the Manager on duty today made things right.   There's so much I could say but I don't have that kind of time when I'm trying to enjoy a few days of R & R.   Come on Vince Neil and Tatuado's, step your game up!",

THEN going thru Circus Circus to look for the restaurant was a nightmare. Kids screaming everywhere, people bumping into you, I got my foot stepped on. Terrible. So by the time we got to the restaurant, all we wanted to do is get our drink on and chill. But that wasn't the case. Now I understand this is a \"Vince Neil\" restaurant so I knew they'd have some music, and noise, but it was not what my sister and I expected. These two people were on stage to what I think was karaoke, very bad karaoke. It looked like they couldn't get the machine to work properly, so one of the guys one stage, thinks he's a comedian, and starts telling the worsts jokes, laughing at his own stuff, everyone watching was embarrassed for them, shaking their head and looking away.  Now once we told our server we had a Groupon, he gave us the cold shoulder. My sister couldn't get her wifi to pull up right away to show the coupon, so he just walked away, and came back after we basically finished all of our water. The food was nothing to talk about, really! I asked the server for horseradish cream for my steak, he gave me packets of relish!!!! Really.. In my opinion, save your money. The whole experience of this night dampened my Vegas experience.",

I felt like we were drinking tequila straight and it's suppose to be a strawberry margarita. lol for some people they would like it that way.  overall, we will be back again. good customer service, good food, strong drinks, and good prices!",

I've been twice and the same thing both times getting your waiter to attend to your requests is near impossible and if you want your order correct forget about it!  So my recommendation if your looking for good drinks and great atmosphere, sit at the bar and order drinks and enjoy the karaoke.",

I took one star off though because one they ran out of the kids mac and cheese (the waitor did try to give my son the adult mac and cheese in a kids bowl) but ya know kids are picky.  We were there for my kids birthday.  Our friend Eddie did karaoke i really enjoyed the karaoke. We spent a hour and a halfish there. When we left my sister in law sat out of the restaurant  (still there bar area) waiting for myself and kids to come from the arcade above and the bartendar was very rude and yelled at her to get the fuck outta there.  After spending  $200 im sure you wouldnt appreciate being talked to like that either. Now my sister in law friend was buying drinks from there bar however she still had a souvier drink that was from circus circus btw and she was trying to finish it. And thats why the bartendar was upset. He could of been way more professional then that come on. When you buy a drink from circus circus many people as myself assume you can drink it anywhere. (I learned when they took my bongos when entering  restaurant area) which blew my mind cause they had other souviner cups around.",

Us being fans of said rocker/band went anyway. While frozen margaritas were over priced (But were in Vegas isn't) it went along with the two appetizers we ordered. Nachos and chips with guacamole. Like I previously stated we knew what we were getting into by choosing to eat at Vince Neil's restaurant. Nachos were good, plenty of toppings, came out warm not to much to screw up on nachos. Guacamole tasted like to was squeezed out of a pouch you buy at your local grocery store, add some salt, mix it up, good to go. Wait staff pretty good, could get a little bogged down during peak hours. But, all in all we knew what to expect before we entered. Last footnote, awesome tunes playing while we ate!!!",

The steaks were delicious....we are visiting from Manhattan and let me tell ya I've paid more money for steaks not as good as these. The fries were crunchy and yummy and veggies were standard. For the wine we chose a Riesling that was great as well...chilled nicely in an ice bucket (we didn't want any wine that was not chilled because of the heat). Overall I have to say that the service alone is very hard to beat and the food followed through. Will return on my next trip!",

It was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The most fun part of the experience was that it was the World Finals of Karaoke.  That was fun and very entertaining.

Let me just say this place was awesome not only was the staff extremely friendly the food was great and had a great time. We had two eight ounce New York steaks that were cooked to perfection the vegetables were mouthwatering and the fries were crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir with our dinner that paired well.  I can't say enough about this place. I highly recommend coming to this place for dinner it's a unique experience the food was delicious and the staff was amazing. Will definitely be back.  Hidden gem.",

Asked another waitress if I could order already knowing what I wanted and she said she was going to get me a menu anyways and walked off. Since she didn't return, I contacted a manager. Another manager came and waited on me with exceptional service but had to leave shortly after. I had eaten about half my food and still no waiter came by. I had to go to the rest room and stepped out for a second. The bussing staff came and threw my half eaten food in the trash and cleaned the table. Finally a waitress came over and took care of the situation. She replaced the chicken, but only half an order. I appreciated  her getting me more, but it wasn't enough for me to come back to this establishment. There's approximately 25% of staff that cares and isn't rude. Seems like management has failed their customers and their employees.",

Low and behold I'm burned again for not checking Yelp before going into an establishment....  why wont' I learn my lesson?  lol  Food was actually decent on the surface...  service was indeed terrible as other indicated and things seemed to move a snails pace.  We had to go track someone down just to put in our order.  The important part here is that my wife and I both received food poisoning here.  We both had burgers.  She was extremely sick for 2 days and couldn't hardly move...  it was NO JOKE.  I've never seen her that sick from food...  I would definitely not recommend going here for that reason alone.  ITS NOT SAFE PEOPLE!!!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday night because my friend was jonesing for karaoke and this place has it 7 nights a week. Located in the Circus Jerkus casino which I would normally avoid but here we were. We Lyfted it over around 8pm or so and the place was pretty hopping. A number of families with little kids were seated near us so I guess you can so it's ok for families. Motley Crue gold records and guitars on the wall so it's like a Hard Rock Cafe centered around Motley Crue. A couple of the items are named after Motley Crue songs - Mac & Cheese Feelgoods Delight and Wild Side BBQ Bacon. I had the Wild Side BBQ Bacon. It was alright. I was starving. They had Lagunitas on draft of which I partook but their beer selection was rather limited. The karaoke host that night was very animated - not sure if I ever saw a host so full of energy. He would put on wigs and rock out with a blow-up guitar standing along the singer whenever they were singing a rock and roll type song. Either that or he would do a dance. Also he would give away prizes and keep the audience engaged with various tricks and audience participation games. The karaoke is done on a big stage and there is a little screen right in the middle where the lyrics get displayed. The microphone is even on a big microphone stand if you ever wanted to play rock star and channel your inner Steven Tyler or Vince Neil and do microphone stand tricks. Food was ok. Karaoke show was a bigger plus in my book. Disappointed that more menu items weren't named after Motley Crue songs. Here's a few suggestions: \"Droppin' Like\" Fries, Shout at the Devil Quesadilla, Smoke the Sky Salmon, Kickstart My Hearty Chili, Grilled, Grilled, Grilled Steak, Hammered Shrimp, Live Wire Burger, Knock 'Em Dead, Dip, Sticky Sweet Creme Brulee. Ok. I'll stop before someone gets violent. Extra point for karaoke good times otherwise the food and our kinda rude waiter would rate just a three. Your mileage, as always, may vary - just don't get caught smokin' in the boys room.",

    "text": "Finally got around to eating here when I had a friend in town that was curious about the place. As a die-hard rock and roll fan I had been curious about this place for quite some time.  Vince Neil is quite the businessman away from the music world as well, having run bars, strip clubs, concert venues, marketed his own alcohol, and now this restaurant in Circus Circus. I have noticed a lot of negative reviews, and while I would not go out of my way to dine here again, if I ever found myself in Circus Circus, I would definitely return.  I am a rock and roll fan and an author of concert and album reviews, plus self published books of classic rock/hard rock bands, so the decor on the walls of this place instantly won me over. Posters of album covers, guitars, vintage stage outfits, vintage Mark Weiss photographs; the decor and photos alike make this place a rock fan's dream come True. I had to get out of my seat twice just to walk around and take it all in!  When I first arrived there was no host(ess) at the booth, but a man dressed in a suit and tie (presumably a manager) seated us within two minutes of arriving at the door. This guy treated us well, checked up on us often, and definitely deserves credit for his efforts. Sadly, the restaurant was short staffed and we did not see many other employees around for most of the dining experience. The few people we dealt with treated us well, but even when it was time to get the bill I had to get up and actually ask someone to bring it.  The biggest issue I had with dining here was that, upon being given the menu, the server told us \"the entrees are not available at lunch.\" So in other words, the good majority of the \"major\" menu items, including several I wanted to try, were not available. Not only would having more of these items available have made for a better dining experience; they also would have gotten more money from me! But seriously, how hard would it be to make a separate lunch menu that at least has SOME of the entree choices?  Music was playing on the speakers/televisions throughout the meal, and not just the hard rock you would expect; there were vintage pop songs as well (Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc.) The manager guy said that the heavier stuff plays later in the evening, and that is understandable enough. There was also a live stage set up, though no live entertainment was playing at the time of our visit.  Contrary to what other reviews have stated, I had no problem with the food whatsoever. I got an order of chicken fingers and fries. The fingers were meaty and crispy, and had no tough meat whatsoever. The fries were very crispy and cooked well. Everything I ate in here was delicious, though I would liked to have been able to taste one of the entrees that are supposedly only available come dinner time.  Overall, my visit to Vince Neil's restaurant was a good one, just not a great one. I am not going to park in the parking garage at Circus Circus and fight my way through the casino again for the purpose of eating here, but if I am in the casino again for any reason, I would be willing to dine their again. If you are visiting Circus Circus or the area anyway, I recommend dining here, just keep your expectations in check. Overall I can give Tatuado a modest recommendation.",

We immediately put our order in the first time seeing him And it took an hour and 45 minutes to get our check. 5 tables that were sat after us, finished and left before we even got our check. We sat for 45 minutes waiting for any service by ANY employee. On top of that the hostess left people standing next to our table for multiple minutes which completely made our atmosphere uncomfortable. Then to top it off the manager did NOTHING to resolve our complaints. I am someone who has served and bartended in the restaurant industry for 6 years. This restaurants customer service is absolute garbage and I do not recommend it at all. They are only worried about the money not the service or satisfaction of their customers. They stick you in the corner and treat you like it, but we weren't even in the corner and still were completely ignored, that's how bad it was.",

The atmosphere and even at 9am was very good, music videos playing on all the TV's, lots of music not just Crue songs or hair rock. The decor was awesome with lots of platinum records and old pictures all over the walls.   We went in for breakfast, it wasn't that crowded, we were seated immediately, the waitress/ service was very fast. The food was delicious even if it was a little over priced. The menu is pretty standard for breakfast, nothing to blow you away or surprise you but it was all very good. We had a party of 12 and everyone enjoyed their meals.   My review doesn't get the FULL story because we stopped in for breakfast, I would have loved to have done dinner/ karaoke there but maybe next time.",

    "text": "Okay so this was one of those things where we gambled and we won. We bought a Groupon for the restaurant for two steak dinners, a bottle of wine, and cheesecake for $30-something. We were so apprehensive about the place after we bought the Groupon and did some research, and that feeling remained until we actually sat down and started having a great time. This was probably our favorite dining experience we had all trip.  Pros: -Of course the playlist was amazing. They played a lot of 2000's alternative, so we sang along to virtually everything that came on (H.I.M. was played. When was the last time you heard them playing overhead anywhere?) They also have nightly karaoke -The steak was well seasoned, and the menu covered a lot of different types of food, so there's something for everyone. The cheesecake was vacuumed up in about two seconds, and the wine was a better quality than we thought it'd be. -The service was exceptional. Our waiter was great, and the GM came out to introduce himself to us.  Cons: -The restaurant is in Circus Circus and has a separate bar that you find before the restaurant. We saw the bar area first thinking it was the whole establishment and kind of internally freaked out because it was not at all the kind of place we wanted to eat. Thankfully, the bartender told us there was a sit down section, and things picked up from there. Circus Circus should have better signs for it. -We ordered our steaks medium and they came out done, so just make sure to order one temp down.  -The price without a Groupon is steep. We paid $36 for everything which is pretty cheap normally, but without the Groupon our dinner would have been about $100.  I'd probably come back with another deal or if I was in Vegas with a rock fan who would enjoy the atmosphere.",

Who puts hot sauce in Blue Cheese Dressing? And to not warn people? Tasted the Balsamic Vinaigrette, it was horrible tasting. tasted like it was loaded with Worcestershire Sauce, or something.  Waitress was very rude to us. Tried to get someone to get the manager. Finally, just left. Got tired of waiting, and figured if they can't deliver on a simple salad, we didn't want to know what the rest of the food was like.",

Now I will get attack by all the beaverettes out there.   We decided to eat at Tatuado. We approached the front and no one to greet us. The bar tender saw us but ignored us. We were about to leave and the phone rang, we saw someone coming to the front to answer the phone. Finally we got seated.   This is what we ordered...........  Pina Colada... it was all pina colada syrup with a spit full of alcohol and no ice. It tasted like cheap pina colada.   Mac and Cheese... My daughter is a mac and cheese fanatic she didn't like it at all. It came with fries. Fries were actually really good.   Shrimp tacos....The shrimp were grilled from one side only. It was just ok. The pico de gallo was to die for. That was the best pico de gallo I have ever tasted. Vince Neal needs to have his own pico de gallo brand. It came with chips and salsa. I ate 2 tacos and destroyed the 3rd one. Did not eat the chips and salsa.   Spaghetti... It had the smallest meatballs I have ever seen. I did not tried it but he said it wasn't good at all. He said it was bland and needed seasoning. He did not get garlic bread or anything to go with his spaghetti.   Cheesecake... It was not good at all!!   Everything came to $60 including tip. My daughters meal was free with a coupon they were giving away at the casino. We left hungry and very disappointed. Our waiter was super nice and very pleasant to deal with. Sorry Vince but we did not like the food. You need another chef and better management. There should be someone in the front greeting customers and kick ass food.",

There were tables all around us also waiting for varying lengths of time to be helped as well. After 30 minutes of waiting for our food, my husband inquired about our order and we were told it would be out in two minutes. After an additional 10 minutes of waiting, we were so discouraged, we finally got up and left, though we did inform the manager/waiter why we were doing so. The manager/waiter said the kitchen was backed up. The kitchen was more than backed up, it appears the entire restaurant was short-staffed from the wait staff to the kitchen staff, and everything in between. Not a way to run a restaurant by any means, especially in Las  Vegas during the holidays.",

    "text": "Used a Groupon steak dinner for two with a bottle of wine. We ordered the rockin' nachos for an appetizer and were pleased with the portion size and the taste. Almost a meal in itself. The steak (NY strip) was decent, nothing like you'd expect at a steak house but better than average. The plate came with steak fries and sauteed zucchini as sides. Delish. The wine was a bottle of Tisdale that you can find locally for $3.99. We had the creme brulee for dessert. It was nothing special as it was served warm with a center that was still cold and solid like custard, which let us know that these desserts are kept in the fridge and microwaved when ordered. Overall we thought the food and the wine were a good value even for the regular price. The food and service is the reason for 3 stars. Otherwise it would be less because of how our Vince Neil expectations devolved.  Being a big Crue fan, I was glad to see 80's hair band rock videos being played when we walked in at 3:15pm. With Skid Row's 18 and life on the screen I knew I was in the right joint. Rock memorabilia on the walls added to the flavor and decor. However our rock experience took a huge detour at 4pm. That's when country music hit the big screen. We thought maybe it was just part of the random music selection, but after the 3rd video in a row from the same group we asked the waiter what happened to the rock videos. He proceeded to tell us that the videos were being played by the manager because that's the music SHE likes. We said YIKES!  We asked him to ask her to change it and he said he would tell her, but what followed was 3 more videos of the same band (a total of 6 in a row) and a continuing onslaught of country crap until we left just before 5pm!! We couldn't get out of there fast enough. Our ears were bleeding with songs about dogs and trucks and broken heart twang. There's plenty of country bar and grills in this town, Vince Neil's Tatuado doesn't need to be one of them. Go for the food but leave before 4pm, at least on Wednesdays. Don't think we'll be back. Sorry Vince.",

Vince Neil's Tatuado has a hip, fun atmosphere, serves great food, and has even better drinks... and I'd give an extra star for the amazing staff if Yelp would let me. If you're looking for a great place to kick back for a drink and a meal while in Vegas, this is it! So glad we stumbled upon this place, and can't wait to return!  Vince Neil's Tatuado EAT DRINK PARTY is at the top of our \"Must Return To\" list for our next trip back to Sin City. HIGHLY recommend - check it out!",

I ordered a medium rare steak it was well done when I got it. The next one wasn't even cooked it was completely raw. I am like ok no biggie I SHOULD HAVE WENT TO A STEAKHOUSE. The \"manager\" said he felt the first one was medium so told them to not cook this one as much maybe I was confused. No a medium steak is mostly hot pink center with slightly darker edges. So I am like your right no biggie I just don't want anything its ok. He did offer me other options but he was very condescending so I said nope just remove it from my bill. I get the bill its for $38. I asked to speak to him again he makes me wait 20 minutes and said its all he can do. I paid it I would rather dispute it with my bank than argue with him. Do not eat here! The cheese cake my neighbors said was stiff!",

And a bowl of chili yes that's sounds fucken interesting right? I love RumChata I first discovered it in the mid west 3 years ago before it came to the west coast. It taste like thick sweet cinnamon toast crunch milk. I never thought to batter anything with it. This is what made me order this late night breakfast style dish for morning breakfast. So first the chili was great very hearty and not too beanee the bell peppers gave it a Mexican flavor like that Pato sauce my mom uses. In a way it taste like what my dad calls a revuelto (a mix of what ever cans he finds of vegetables and ground beef.) all that was missing was the old green beans to make it take like my dad experiments. It taste very home made and I really enjoyed it. My wife too she ate some of it. ( psa ladies: please order your own food) and now for the RUMCHATA French toast: well, I can't really taste the RumChata, I am not even sure if it's just a sales pitch or gimmick cuz I really don't taste shit!!! It's just half dry French toast. That's all nothing special. The buffet at circus circus has better shit than this dry bread. I feel like they other great things on the menus that I could of had and I wasted it in a 16.99 plate of dry French toast. My wife got the chorizo which was delicious I feel I like I just got tatuado with something I didn't like and now I have to live with it for ever.",

Another ten to fifteen minutes for them to get our drink and food order. Mind you it was not busy at all. Waited for about a half an hour for our food and when we ordered we asked for ranch. Of course it was not brought to us so we asked again when they brought us our food and again it was not brought to us. Finally my boyfriend had to get up and ask for ranch and refills on our drinks because nobody came buy to see if we needed anything. Their food was okay but the fries were cold and stale. We had to get up and find someone to bring us our bill as well. So all in all it was a terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend it to anybody.",

I had the mushroom burger and a cocktail. Both my friend and I thought the food and drinks were excellent. (But, why only a tiny amount of fries???) Food is fairly priced for a burger place in Vegas.   The one complaint I have was the staff. The whole trip up until this point, everywhere we went everyone was super friendly and personable, except this place. We had to wait to be seated and there was no hostess in sight, we were told someone would be with us soon after being seated and a gentleman stepped in to take our order since our waitress was behind. He was nice. He did mention we had to wait for our bar drinks for \"when the bartender gets back\"... he seemed almost confused as to where the bartender went. But overall, we didn't wait too long for our drinks.   Our actual waitress, she basically talked to us in passing without stopping, never even got her name and it took her forever to run our payment and bring back our card. No smile, no thank you, no nothing from her. She either seemed like she was overworked with too many tables or was perhaps new to her job? Overwhelmed I guess.   As we were walking out, walked right past a woman at the hostess station, she completely ignored us. A \"have a good night\" or \"thank you\" would have been a much better way to treat your customers with customer service.  For the most part the food makes up for crappy service. I'd hate to see how the staff handles a busy restaurant.",

I'd give it more stars but they are really short staffed. 1 bartender for the floor and a bar that's about 100ft long, 1 hostess and I saw 1 bus boy,2 servers and 1 runner. The manager in the Grey shirt walked around looking busy but didn't really do anything in the almost 2 hours I was there. I will say he put away a high chair from a table that was empty for about 15 minutes. They are practically begging you to come into eat with multiple people handing out coupons. With 3 kids couldn't pass up the kids eat free coupon. You must present the coupon prior to ordering which I did. The coupon states one free kids meal with per entree purchased from the classics menu. We ordered 2 entrees and got billed for both kids meals . Showed the waiter he had to ask the busy manager to adjust the bill, came back and one was still being charged, went back again and he told me that I would need 2 coupons to make it 2 kids free deals. WTF... that's not what the coupon says. Waiter finally took care of it but I have a feeling I was gonna get hosed had I not spoken up. Gotta give my waiter credit, he was busting his ass trying to keep up. Should've got his name so I could give him kudos. Whoever the manager was that night ... you're lazy, should've gotten more involved. Karaoke was going on that night pretty entertaining if I must say",

Food is good but to some it might seem a  \"little\" pricey but pricing is standard and to be expected of any place on the Las Vegas strip so hotel guests need to take advantage of any deals/specials.  The sound system is awesome. The amount of Vince Neil memorabilia is amazing and he is at the restaurant on occasion like his birthday this past February.",

(The table next to us was literally waving their arms trying to be noticed, to no avail).  I have NEVER written a negative review before- I have worked in the food industry myself and know that anyone can have an off day, however, the combination of bad service from MULTIPLE staff members and poor management have compelled me to do so now. Stay away until new management is in place.",

We ordered the 8 oz steak for two with a bottle of wine for $29.00, (coupon from book from Circus Circus hotel,) Jambalaya, and kids grilled cheese.   My son had a premium grilled cheese, husband said it was delicious. My oldest son had the Jambalaya, and aside from the sausage quality, was very tasty!!! It is a bit spicy, and I love spicy, so be warned.   The Steaks were delicious, and the only drawback was fries instead of mashed potatoes or another starch. The veggies are definitely crunchy, just as described.   Overall, I loved the quality of food, plus the service.",

    "text": "Eh, I definitely wouldn't go back here unless I absolutely had to.  Yep, we had THAT much fun!  Here's why:  1. The food is mediocre at best.  The menu items sound good, but they all lacked in follow through.  I had a burger and I think I would have rather gone to a fast food place instead and would have been happier.  My daughter had pancakes and they were blah, IHOP has better ones and for cheaper too.  2. The hot mess that was the kitchen.  I have no idea what was going on, but it was bad.  We got there on a Tuesday afternoon just after 12pm.  There were only 3 tables sat when we walked in.  Our server was great and super fast.  We ordered and then the wait started.  It was over 40 minutes before our food came out.  We kept asking if they had an ETA and they just kept saying it was coming.  When the food did come out, the plates were super hot but the food was warm at best.  My daughter's pancakes were rubbery and cold on a scalding hot plate. The only food that came out at the right temp was the scrambled eggs on a different plate.  Complete disappointment across the board.  Also, but this time, most of the tables were sat and no one was getting their food at all, so it was a whole kitchen issue.  There were plenty of servers who were doing great.  My dad wanted to just leave, but there really wasn't anywhere else to eat in the place that wasn't fast food or a buffet, and we needed to be on property for other commitments.   It's hard to even write this review because I love me some Vince Neil and Motley Crue, but something needs to be fixed ASAP.",

Took a while to get drink orders in.  We ordered the \"monstrosity platter\" of appetizers.  While we waited for the food to come out, we watched the line to get in get longer and longer because there was no hostess up front at the hostess station.  The folks seated next to us still waiting to put there drink orders in.  Our food finally came out.  The food was ok, but just ok.  This \"monstrosity platter\" is definitely not worth its $35.99 price tag.  These were apps that we could have gotten at the snack bar at the amusement park, just much more expensive.  I was still hungry enough to order dessert, which was the Krispy Kreme doughnut sandwich.  Even that took a while to come out.  But when it did, it was delicious and the highlight of the rather tasteless meal.  Still would not come back to eat here though because of the painfully slow service.",

After waiting about 10 mins, we were seated, we decided on drinks. It literally took 40 MINUTES for 3 drinks. Not even waters were brought to us. We ordered food and waited a another 30 MINUTES I noticed the manager walking around and around and flagged her down and asked if we could just get the check for our drinks and leave. She ignored me and walked away and simple said \"let me check on your order\". 5 minutes later our food was brought to us. Food tasted great don't get me wrong, but the service is the worse I've ever received. The manager had the nerve to walk over and asked how our food was not apologize what so ever until I again complained about how it should not take 50+ minutes for food. She began giving excuses after excuses to why it was taking long and stated to me \"well if you could see we only have one chef back there you would understand\" I DONT CARE !!! it's that kind of attitude and customer service that is disgusting !!

I went there with my son (who is 7 and luckily ordered a hamburger - can't really screw that up too badly) and my sister. We were waiting for our server for quite a while when some waitress was walking by - I asked, \"are you our waitress?\", and she said, \"sure, I guess\" - no introduction - no personality, no nothin'! We ordered our food - and 20 minutes later another waitress brought our food. Mind you, we still hadn't gotten any drinks we ordered. I can understand that picking up 1 water and 1 soda can be quite difficult - so someone else had to bring our drinks. The steak I ordered was disgusting- tough and full of fat. I tried to get our waitress but she was very rude. Finally I asked for the manager, who came about 10 minutes later. We talked to him about the food and the service. He apologized and said he would try to fix it. So he brought our check and said he was going to take off a whole 6.99!!! Woo hoo! Are you kidding?!?! I told him I thought he should comp my whole dinner, not the price of something I didn't order, but he wouldn't do it. So then I had to pay the waitress that was completely useless through the rest of the evening. So I give my card and she comes back after running it and says, \"here!\" ... And threw my receipt and card on the table! I have never been treated so rudely in my life! And I am a New Yorker so that says something! Do not ever eat there! They just suck!",

I'm not asking anyone to bend over backwards or anything, but the least you could do is ask me how my food is! When I first got there my son and I waited about 5 minutes, there was no host in sight and I didn't see a sign, so I assumed it was maybe seat yourself! After 3 people passed us and after about 10minutes, I finally stopped someone and asked if there was a host and they said yes! So I apologized for seating myself and they got me a menu! When I asked what beers they had on tap the guy had no idea and had to look! So I asked what beer the mad dog was! I was told its a black ipa and then a black lager! When it came, it was just a plain lager and it wasn't very good (I am kinda a beer snob tho, I'm from Oregon)! Lol! That not there fault, but the fact he didn't know what he was talking about at all was kinda a bad sign! At the same time I ordered my beer, I also ordered my sons grilled chz! I got my beer and waited over 5 minutes before they came back to take my order! After putting in my order, we waited about 20 more minutes for our food! This restaurant was not busy at all, maybe 1/4 full! After a good 20 minutes, finally my sons (who is super hungry) grilled chz came out! Really over 20 minutes for grilled chz! The plate was way to hot for a small child, but the chz on the inside was cold! That can only mean one thing....,it sat in the window the whole time! Keep in mind I ordered it early so I could feed my child before my food came! Then just a couple minutes later here comes my burger! The burger was ok, not worth what I paid for and the grilled chz was ok, 2 thick pieces of bread with maybe 2 thin slices of cheese! As we were sitting there waiting for our food, I was digging all the 80s music and the videos they had to go along with it! Then all of a sudden the music switched to this remixed new aged 80s crap, but the videos stayed the same! So the music didn't line up with the videos anymore! I was pissed at that point and ready to leave! We went there for the love of the 80s, not new aged mixed 80s crap!!! So we ate our food and no one asked us how it was, as I finished my burger I saw our server eating! I guess I hope his food was good! I guess I should have served him and asked! I had to ask the bartender for a box and a different server for the check! We never saw our original server again! It really sucked! I strongly don't recommend eating here! YI regretted not going to subway! It was that bad! I wish I would have saved my $30!!!",

The second time I sat at the bar and service was prompt the whole night.  The third time, I again sat at the bar and after the initial beer couldn't get the bartender to come back over for a food order.  Another gentleman got to the bar just after me and also could not get the bartender to come back for a food order after the initial beer.  Two more gentleman sat down at the bar after us and never got a drink order in.  They finally left after 15 minutes with no attention.  I set cash down for the beer and headed to McDonald's instead.  The other guy also left cash for his beer and exited.  When it works, it's a fun place with karaoke in the evenings.  When it doesn't though, you wish you had never, ever heard of the place.",

The atmosphere is awesome and could really be a great place if they hired new staff!! The manager clearly doesn't have standards for his staff. All the waiters and waitresses have awful attitudes. One waitress was ticked off and threw the menus right near us.  Our waitress was just as awful and rude.  We eat out a lot and this was the worst service ever.   Her attitude wasn't professional or pleasant at all.  The only employee that we did encounter that was nice and friendly was the hostess and she is actually the person that brought our food out to us.  Maybe the the manager might think about moving her to the floor to wait tables, she was the only person that asked if we were doing well, asked if we needed anything else and legitimately cared. I wished they wore name tags or even introduced themselves so I could name drop. I can say we came for lunch on Saturday around noonish.   If this establishment failed I will tell you right now it's because of the awful staffing.   I'd like to see this place getting more stars because it is a fun atmosphere and great food!",

We also sat next to the stage for the Karaoke event happening, I don't mind that but the music was loud and you can not hear the person next to you. I don't understand why the bar and grill places need to have the music BLASTING so you cant hear anything while your trying to enjoy their meal and company. I would probably go back here but make sure there's not a music night. Overall though the food was good and different I would say try this place if you like music, and bar food.",

Everything about the food was just off. Our waiter came a few times and wasn't showing the customer service that should be given. He wasn't rude he was just blah, like he was miserable. The icing on the cake was it was karaoke night. If I would of known I would of sat somewhere away from the stage. The guy and girl running the equipment had some issues resulting in loud noises that startled everyone in the restaurant. It made it hard to have any type of conversation with anyone.",

We had the best experience with Tito (bartender). We had breakfast upon arrival, $10.99 for sirloin steak and eggs. Large portion and the steak was seasoned perfectly. We care back for a happy hour after SEMA, not sure where you can get premium vodka for $6.50 on the strip, but you came here. We loved the burger and service so much, that we came back to Tito the second night. I had a house salad and my BF had another burger. I'm not going to lie, the burger is one of the best that we've had, and we travel a lot. We usually stay in a higher end hotel, but we have to say that this is the best spot on the strip for burgers and drink, plus titos customer service will have you come back for more.  As you can see, we finished everything.",

However, when it's NYE and you don't have reservations or feel like braving through the crowds along the strip, this was the best option in Circus Circus. There was no wait and the restaurant wasn't even half full. I was surprised to see so many kids eating there, but then again, it is inside of Circus Circus. Food was average, but service was surprisingly good. They had a DJ on stage, but he was somewhat awkward.   Started with the firecracker wings. Given the name, I assumed these would be spicy. Maybe we received BBQ by mistake because these had no kick to them at all. On the bright side, they were fried nicely. For my entree, I had the grilled chicken and avocado burger. The chicken had a lot of flavor, the bacon was crispy, and there was a generous amount of avocado and pico de gallo. However, I found my burger to be just okay. I did really enjoy the cheddar jalapeno bun, though. The side of fries were plentiful, but again, just okay.  Service was excellent, with our waitress being very accommodating throughout our meal. With so many options along the Strip, not sure I'd make it back here again when I'm in town.",

Their water tasted like I was drinking sand. Super gritty and just disgusting. I had to order a bottle of water!! Which is listed for $2.50 on their menu but we were charged $3.50, we saw on the bill.  Our waitress, Elizabeth, gave us our menus and got us our waters. Then she disappeared for awhile and a different waitress, w/ black hair pulled into a tight ponytail, came and took our orders and told us she'd be helping Elizabeth with our table.   We ordered the Spinach Artichoke Dip for our appetizer. It took awhile to come out and wasn't that awesome. It had way huge artichoke hearts and barely any to dip!  I ordered the Wild Side BBQ bacon burger and my boyfriend ordered the Ulcerator burger. It came out like right, right after our appetizer. Annoying.  I asked for my Wild Side BBQ bacon burger with no cheese. And it came out with absolutely nothing on it???  Just a plain burger... not even BBQ sauce or bacon... just plain!! The food runner just dropped our food off and walked away so I didn't even have time to tell him that it was wrong. We waited around looking for at least one of our waitresses and we couldn't find her. A nice lady sitting at a table next to us asked me what was wrong and I told her and she even tried to help us flag down a waitress. Finally, a hostess or something went to get Elizabeth. I told Elizabeth that it wasn't what I had ordered. I told her I wanted the Wild Side BBQ burger w/ everything else just no cheese! She took my burger, that had just been sitting on my table, untouched, as I waited around for someone I could inform about the mistake.   She came back out in literally 2 seconds with some old and stale bacon, a mess of old onion strings, cold BBQ sauce, and said \"for some reason they thought you wanted nothing on the burger\" ... now why in the world would I order the Wild Side BBQ burger if I wanted nothing on it???   I took a few bites, I already knew I hated it on the first bite but I wanted to eat, I was so hungry. After the 3rd bite I had to put it down. It tasted like I was eating a cube of ice. Everything was so hard and cold...   Again... Elizabeth was nowhere to be found. A busser noticed we were unhappy and he asked me what was wrong. I told him and he went to grab our waitress with the black ponytail. She came back and was super apologetic, she asked if I wanted something else but I just wanted my money back because I didn't want to wait for another shitty meal from here. After she took my plate away, Elizabeth comes by and asks \"so the burger still wasn't what you wanted?\" & I tell her \"it's what I wanted, it was just really nasty\" & she rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and just WALKED AWAY! Wow, right? No apologies, nothing.   We RARELY ever complain or ask for refunds but this time, I HAD to.   The manager also came and asked if we'd like to replace our entree or remove it from the bill. I told him remove it from the bill.  My boyfriend's Ulcerator burger came out correctly the first time. But, they were super skimpy on fries, less than 10 fries came on the plate!! I personally didn't like this burger either, it looked and sounded like it should have been packed with flavor but it just wasn't. It just tasted like ham and dry meat.   At least they refunded me. I'm really glad the girl with the black ponytail was helping Elizabeth because if she had been our only waitress, I'm sure we wouldn't have gotten any service at all. I wish I remembered the other girl's name because she really was wonderful.  I was still hungry but scared of the restaurants and deli in Circus Circus but I knew Auntie Anne's wouldn't let me down so for dinner, I wanted to try this place but instead I ate a PRETZEL from Auntie Anne's on the way out from this place!   Worst service and even worse food here at Vince Neil's!! If I could give it 0 stars I would have.   (Maybe it would have been better if it was Nikki Sixx's restaurant, ha ha.)",

Lunch and dinner is a little better, but still overpriced for the low quality and slow service.  If you find yourself on this end of the Strip, just go to SLS or hop in a cab.  No bueno.    Really, don't eat the breakfast.",

This was my and my husband's first trip to Las Vegas, and after the flight, shuttle ride and check-in process we were ready to eat. So we saw a sign in the casino for this place and thought burgers and beers sounded perfect. I still think they would have been great. Just not here.  We were seated in the unhappiest waitress' section and were alternately ignored or snapped at the entire meal. I don't normally rate service because my idea of good service and your idea of good service might be very different. But this was flat out BAD service.  I ordered a burger stacked with mac and cheese, (sounds decadent right?!) and my husband a chicken and avocado burger/sandwich. The only thing worth mentioning are the fries that came with the sandwiches. They were crisp and an unusual take on waffle fries. Both of our sandwiches lacked flavor. His sandwich had no sauce of any variety on it and my burger hadn't been seasoned. And let's not talk about beer prices. For that price my beer better arrive ice cold and promptly. Neither happened.  Eat somewhere else. This place is worth skipping for sure.",

Service was horrible, he played hide and seek through our horrible experience.  I asked him about if the bartender can make me a drink not on their horrible alcohol list and he went so far in left field that I was embarrassed of what came out of his mouth. I'd ask if they can make a Mojito and he said he thinks he can, that's made with Orange juice right? He say's and I was like, are you kidding me? No it doesn't. So he said he was going to ask the bartender after he took the rest of our parties drink and I over heard him asking the bartender if he can make a Mojito and it looked by his face that he was being spoke in a foreign language he couldn't understand, then said I don't know how to.  Well my friend, I can see you probably won't move up from this place not knowing a generic drink as the Mojito is.  Well enough of that horrible scene to the food; the food was overcooked and was just horrible. We had the chicken burrito which was prepared to make you sick. Our party also ordered three burgers, which were overcooked and bad.  Then finally we had fried chicken and that was actually decent.  But Vince Neil needs to get kicked in his balls for this horrible restaurant and not giving a crap about his restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here yesterday with my friends and didn't even know that it was the opening night. The restaurant is located in Circus, Circus. Its got a real edgy rocker decor as it should. There's also lots of cool pics on the wall of other rockers and a cool display of clothing in the back along with an art gallery of rock and roll themed art. Its noisy but its a party atmosphere and the t.v.'s play motley crue videos.   As far as the food and drinks, they are priced decently, nothing too expensive. For my drink, I ordered \"the groupie\" which is made with a bubblegum flavored vodka. I didn't care for it too much because it was way to sweet and loaded with syrup, my friend also complained of his drink being the same way. For food, I had the Bang, Bang Shrimp. On the menu, it was described as shrimp dusted with some kind of seasoning and spice with bacon, sliced carrots, zucchini and squash with a scoop of jasmine rice. What I got was soggy vegetables, barely any bacon, 5 pieces of shrimp and rice that wasn't jasmine swimming in a bath of spicy creme sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting when I read the description of the dish. I ate as much of it as I could, plus the rice was a little undercooked. Next time I come back, I won't get this again.  Aside from the food, we all had a great time and as an added bonus, Vince Neil was actually there! He came over to our table and took a pic with our friends who were big fans. It was super cool of him to do that. It was opening night, so there is still time for the place to work out the kinks in the food department, but other than that, we did eat, drink and party.",

Brandon our greeter was the rockstar of the place, super personable and attentive.  Steaks were ok but not $ 30.00 a pop good, portion was just right to clean the plate but didn't leave you feeling immobile.  Overall, unless you're staying here its not a place that will compete with some of the other fine dining in Vegas but if you have a family and you're trying to please everyone it could be the spot for you if you're in the neighborhood. Won't blow you away but will satisfy for a night of just hunger.  P.S. Really glad they didn't have karokee, not the intimate place to have a steak, there will be a lot of noise and action going on.",

We didn't know what to expect since we read the reviews beforehand and it seemed about 50/50. Lots of complaints about the food and the service. We were seated right away and greeted by a friendly server. We mentioned the Groupon and she seemed to be ok with it (other reviews said the servers were rude when mentioning the Groupon). Also the general manager walked around and greeted us and made sure we were good. We got our food right away and it wasn't too bad. I ordered my steak medium rare and got medium but I was ok with this. The food was good...would I pay full price for this dinner, no, but for the price it was worth it. Both the boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised with this place considering the not so good reviews. Would we return here again? Maybe if we had another Groupon.",

The entire time we were there we never got utensils to eat with and our table had two empty ketchup bottles. Our waitress only came to take our order once then when we had to flag her down after 10-15 minutes of not seeing her at all even though it wasn't even busy. She never refilled our drinks. Our kids were crying and fussy after we waited around 30-45 minutes to get our food. Spare yourself - the only memorable part of this dining experience was that it was probably the worst food and service I have ever gotten at any restaurant. This is the only negative review I have ever written and I am pretty forgiving but this was bad.",

Listen learned stay away from this place and casino in general. There is way too many other great restruant's that actually care in this town.",

The place was not empty but it wasnt full to the point where anything should be moving at a glacier speed. We were seated right away. Our party had 4 people.   Waitress took some time to ask for our drinks. I ordered a pina colada that I thought I would go in to diabetic shock if I continued to drink it. I didnt taste rum at all. We waited about 15 min after getting our drinks to order since it seemed our server was nowhere to be found. We ordered our food and appetizers. Now I have never worked food service but usually you bring the appetizers first then the meal. We waited a good 30-45 min before any food showed up. My BF really had a difficult time not getting up and leaving. Finally all the food (appetizers and main entree came at the same time) it took a little bit over 10 min to get the ketchup and hot sauce we asked for.   My friend ordered hot buffalo wings. They brought BBQ wings. She asked them to please change the wings, it took another 20 min before we had the wings. She took a bite and her face turned red. She couldnt even finish the wing. She insisted that those were not buffalo wings they were something else with possibly ghost peppers of some sort. She insitted that she couldnt even eat a 2nd wing and offered us to try.   I love spicy food. LOVE IT! I took one bite and definitely, the wing was something that was like eating fire. My lips were red and burning. Those wings were not edible.   We asked for the supervisor and he said that we had ordered some firecracker wings which was not correct. These freaking wings could have made a hole in her stomach had she ate them. He took them and then brought us a round of drinks. We were thankful however; I again got that overly sweet pina colada. No thank you. I ended up giving it away to the lady at our next table.   When we got our bill the wings were charged! We ate 2 wings and requested to be sent back and told them we didnt want them. The manager was aware of this as he asked if we wanted something else to replace it again.   We placed our card to pay and even that took a good 20 minutes to get our card back. We were looking for our waitress and she was MIA.   Never again. I thought it was overpriced and service was super slow. Only good thing was that the place has some nice decor and Karaoke was going on.",

This restaurant is located in the casino level of Circus Circus, but on the side.  I'm not sure if they forgot to turn on the lights, but I found the restaurant to be super dark.  It was a bit hard to read the menu.  After getting seated, it took a while before a waitress stopped by our booth.  We decided to order some breakfast items.  I ordered the 2 eggs with pancake and sausage.  I added a side order of potatoes.  After about 15 minutes, our food came out.  The potatoes were really salty.  The pancake and eggs were edible and tasted ok.  Overall, this place is ok.  Its not the best tasting food.  The booths needs to be renovated, since the seat cushions had a lot of rips.  Service was decent, too.",

We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and it was not appetizing at all. It reminded me of a sloppy Tex mex meets \"I'm trying to be healthier\" nachos. The nachos was heavily smothered in watery chili (no meat sauce), red beans, tons of jalapenos, olives and what seemed like nuked shredded cheese on top of the chips. I don't recommend it but to each is own.   My better half ordered the All American Burger and I ordered the Egg You Burger.  The burgers looked good when they arrived at our table and tasted delicious at 1st bite.   Our ghost waited never came to ask us how we were doing until towards the end of our meal. Napkins were needed and so was a glass of water. I asked for a to go cup to take my ice tea with me and he ignored that request and brought us the bill instead.   Where did they get this guy from?!

Food: Had the steak deal which came with a New York strip, fried and vegetables for two, along with a bottle of wine and a piece of cheesecake to share. The food was pretty good, no complaints but nothing I will remember forever or anything.   Service: Nothing special, it was not bad. He was attentive and nice.

Try eating cold mashed Potatoes and let me know how happy u are after lol so we called immediately they told us they were closing and took my info said I had a free dinner on them next time we come. I spent about 100 bucks so I was not happy. The ribs were burnt to a crisp and when we did go back Jose who is supposed to be over the whole restaurant was very rude and accused us of being one of his many customers that come in trying to get free food. Sad part is I was ready with my card in hand to just pay for the food.. he was disrespectful and I'm surprised he is a supervisor speaking that way to guest. I'm sure if anyone was to play back the conversations he has with guests they would be disgusted. He threw a box of hot wings at my kids and said that's all he could do as if they were hungry dogs. It was embarrassing. He also made us wait an hour before even researching with his staff to see who had spoke With me. Jackie is who I spoke with and when she was asked by Jose she denied having any knowledge of the issue but when I confronted her with Jose there she Changed her story and suddenly remembered me. If ur gonna be in this business you have to treat people with respect. Not everyone are scammers or liars. If ur traveling to circus circus I'd suggest the buffet DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY HERE THEY ARE RUDE ANS FOOD IS NOT GOOD AT ALL.",

Came to let the kids play the night before and seen there breakfast special and figured hey why not try on our way out of town in the morning.... BIG MISTAKE!!!! The place was pretty empty when we arrived. Had to wait 15 minutes to even be seated! Once we were seated the service was horrendous and the food... When it was brought to the servers attention, she looked at us as if we were speaking a different language... BURNT BACON... BURNT TOAST... How do you burn toast and serve it in a restaurant?  NEVER AGAIN!!!",

He wouldn't even touch it. Employees standing around talking and cursing. After paying $163 you think the food quality and service would've been better.",

The second day we order there was actually an accident that occurred with my debit card where the server accidentally input $500 for tip instead of $5 not knowing the situation my bank reported and I declined to the transaction that was made. Which pushed them to cancel my card and was being sent a new one. I called and was upset about the inconvenience and they invited us to dine-in at the restaurant with a gift certificate given for the troubles. And let me tell you it is a great place to eat. Everything tasted and looked delicious! The service is spectacular! Prices are fair for the quality of food. Made our last night there perfect. The inconvenience was quickly made up. I am very satisfied with the business. And I will be coming back again. Thank you to the managers Jose and Mike you guys are great.",

I love mashed potatoes almost always, even out the box, I swear they are 100xs better than what I put in my mouth from this place. I thre them and most of my burger away.",

With that being said, the steak was well cooked, the sides were tasty and the service was top-notch. Even using the Groupon, we never had less than excellent service.

My girlfriend and her man had a groupon for a steak dinner with a bottle of wine, starter salad, and cheesecake. They both have been here before using the same deal and had an equally pleasurable experience. Besides this place being in a filthy casino (which is why I negate one star), the service and food were on point. My husband ordered the chicken fajita burrito and I ordered the veggie burrito. I enjoyed my plate (rice was very good which shocked me and the burrito size was perfect for the amount of bread.) They have the burrito perfected. Each burrito came with a side of unsalted tortilla chips. For the price, this is an affordable option when taking a large party out to the strip. I would dine here again. If only there was an outside entrance so I didn't have to walk through Circus-Circus.   TO MY VEGGIE HEADS: this is a friendly place for us. There are a few options besides salads to chose from.",

After we sat down it took forever for our server to greet us and then for us to tell the server to clean the table. As we were greeted which was not even a greet more like a what do you want. We told the server which was Brian we have a groupon and without anything else said he asked for the groupon number and left. We did not get asked for drinks nor if we would have liked anything else for tonight seriously it was absolutely the worst customer service experience. On top of that we were switched out with a new server without even knowing with a server named JP. Granted the groupon was worth the price but not worth the time to come down to circus circus to be mistreated with horrible customer service at Vince Neil Tatuado.

I was there with a party of 3 so we decided to get the \"Monstrosity Platter\" which is an appetizer plate that serves 6-8, perfect. Let me tell you, it was definitely a monstrosity. I have no idea how you mess up basic bar food apps but everything on that platter tasted like it was out of a bag and nuked. In fact, my friend even made the comment \"Why do I smell plastic?\" the minute it arrived on the table.   The spinach artichoke dip was like paste and had a skin after two minutes as if it had been sitting out overnight, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, my friend who was brave enough to try the ribs took one bite and was disgusted. The quesadilla was fine, the mozzarella sticks were average..Burger King has better ones.    This place serves drinks in souvenir toilet bowls. Now I get why. 2 of the 3 of us were sick all night from this platter. The one that wasn't? That's because she threw up in the restaurant bathroom after 3 bites and had no more.   Vince Neil should be ashamed his name is attached to this place, he's clearly never tried even the food.",

I would not recommend eating at this location circus circus should buy them out of their contract and have their own restaurant",

It took about 30 minutes to get my dad's breakfast steak plate out. He ate it. Finished it. Even went to the restroom and my shrimp tacos still hadnt came. Was ready to cancel them.  Til a man brought them out and didn't even apologize for the wait. Food isn't bad. Customer service wasn't the best. Sitting at the restaurant as I write this. I haven't even gotten my check and we've been sitting fotnquite some time",

I was surprised that we were able to choose from a variety of wines.  The steak was good sized.  It was cooked exactly as ordered and was tender and had a great flavor.  The vegetables that came with it were well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  We also ordered chicken tenders as an appetizer and I was surprised at the generous portion that we received.  Our server was very attentive.  I love the decor as Motley Crue is my favorite band and the music was a perfect compliment.  I would definitely come back here.",

I love all the 80's Rock videos that play and there are the rare occasions Vince Neil is on site (saw him last year, early 2015) (which was pretty bad-ass!).  The food, specifically the entree items, is decent, but their fries are scrawny and gross; couldn't eat them because of them being overcooked, to the point of being chewy.  On the flip side of the clock, breakfast was delish!   I will return to Tatuado!",

All the ingredients were plentiful and I wish they had taken it way earlier because I kept going back at it even though I was full.  We went back for breakfast and/or lunch, with my gf's daughters boyfriend, sadly it wasn't as satisfying. The waitress, Tami, was inattentive and I felt we needed to ask for things more than twice and we were an inconvenience for her. My chicken fried steak was a large portion but basically flavorless.  It's definitely sad and hard to give this place just 3 stars because I'm a fan of the rock and roll theme but one of the only things that would have saved the breakfast was Vince Neil showing up himself.",

We went last night prior to fright dome and all I can say is that I make better food at home! That is not good!  We ordered a large 6 to 8 person appetizer platter that was supposed to be loaded with nachos, quesadillas, a spinach dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, barbecue spareribs, and a few other items. The platter came and it was loaded with all of these things, all of which tasted like food that was taken from a package from the freezer that was bought at Albertson's! To add to that,it also tasted like that same food was leftovers from another party. It was disgusting and we only touched 10% of it. The platter cost $40 and we all agreed that we threw $40 down the drain.  The drinks were average but that is not what we came here. We were literally hungry and we left hungry! Simply put, we are not even going to try to go back here again. This place needs to have new management or a better chef or something. Hands-down, one of the five worst 'restaurants' I have been to in Las Vegas.",

We didn't talk about breakfast but he did come over and ask how our meal was and inform us of the fact there was Kareoke for family and there were some other specials our server didn't tell us.   He made the experience a much better one.  Thank you.",

    "text": "The only reason I would ever actually return to Circus Circus is for VN's Tatuado inside the casino! I can't believe we didn't discover it until the last day we were there. We arrived a week ago on Friday night, checked in, then found nothing to do so we walked around town a little before bed. We could've been singing karaoke?!  They do it nightly starting at 630.  Late afternoon Sunday we decided to grab a bite to eat before heading to the airport. We sat outside the restaurant at the little bar area and Frisco came over and suggested we dine at the bar inside. (We hadn't even noticed there was an inside!) He told us about the drink and food specials during happy hour and we were super excited to check the place out. I learned Vince Neil is like my bf's favorite singer. (I had to ask my boyfriend who he was and he explained the whole Motley Crue band thing.) He looked about as disappointed as I had felt the night before when I learned he didn't know who Piff the Magic Dragon was.   ;) But regardless of the name on the door, this place is terrific!  We went down into the huge restaurant with it's nice stage and awesome pictures all over the walls and sat in the middle of the wrap-around bar, facing some large screen TVs. (There are lots of tables for dining as well.) Tito was the bartender on duty and immediately told us about a deal on margaritas, so we each got a blended strawberry (BOGO free - $12.75). Then half off HH food so we ordered Firecracker wings ($16.99/12) and Spicy Chicken Quesadilla ($18.99). Quesadilla wasn't spicy but the salsa it came with was - beans and rice on the side too and the chicken inside was delicious. Huge portions, very shareable. My wings were a little disappointing but it might have been my fault for not asking if Firecracker meant spicy. I was hoping it did but I received very sweet wings and I kind of dislike sweet foods. But the wings were perfectly cooked and delicious.   The only thing better than the food and decorations was the service. Literally unbeatable. Tito was so funny and friendly and we would totally go back there to see him again. All-around, it was the very BEST way to end our weekend in Vegas and can't wait to stop in again when we're back in a few months.",

This is definitely the place to be. The food we ate was great and to be located in the Circus Circus hotel it was not to to badly priced. There was always someone giving out a coupon daily in the hotel, which I did use. The atmosphere was nice. Didn't have any real issues. Everyone seemed really nice.  Our food was made and brought out fairly quickly. It was all good.  They do have Karaoke and music. Seats a good number of people as well. I like that it was conveniently located in the hotel on the ground floor.   There is a screen/tv that plays music videos song with the music lots of memorabilia and pics to look at in the walls    I really wanted to try the fried chicken will def try the next time we are ever in Vegas.   I can't say enough good things about Ms. Shannon she was so nice and even got my son a birthday treat after breakfast. The next day she had remembered our order and drinks. She was just so kind and sweet.",

My husband had the Vince Hombre and said it was amazing, the blend of chorizo and beef was super flavorful. I had the classic hamburger but it was huge and cooked perfectly with great flavor.

The restaurant: Walls ablazoned with 80s greatness and music pumping in the background provide for a unique and high energy dining experience.  The service: Our waiter was helpful and checked in as necessary.  The food: The burgers tasted good and they were not plain. The Wild Side and Krispy Kreme were both tastey. While not the best burgers ever, they are a notch above Plane Jane burgers found at some other restaurants.  Tastey burgers, plus price, and location make this a solid choice if you are in the area.",

It had been rated best All American food In Vegas for 3 years in a row. I arrived at 5pm on Wednesday day at circus circus location. A few couples were waiting the place was about 90 % full. I was greeted as soon as the hostess came back. I sat at the bar and was greeted right away. The bartender gave a menu and asked if I knew what I wanted to drink or did I need a bit longer.  Really good service. I ended up ordering the egg burger with fries over easy on the egg. You can tell them how to cook burger and the egg. I enjoyed having yolk spread the flavor over burger and fries. I ordered a Tatuado lemonade, it has Vince's signature vodka and cranberry juice lemonade and orange liqueur. The drink was too sweet for me. They have a good beer selection. My meal and drink was $34 not bad for a Vegas restaurant with 80's hair metal and on stage karaoke and a flash down memory lane from Motley Crue, with all their albums, guitars on the wall and  some of Vince stage outfits on the wall. Any motley crue or Vince fan should have a fun time and a good meal here.    I will say not every hostess was excited about working. But most were. It is too bad others had a less fun experience.",

Was pretty empty when we walked in but quickly got crowded with some groups. One group was obnoxious and loud. (We were asked if we would like to move tables but 1) that would be so obvious and 2) we were almost done so it wasn't that long til we leave 3) we should have took the waitress up on our offer) granted , the worker can't control the patrons but they could have requested they behave as there were plenty of other customers by then. Did I mention how annoying? If you're I. The mood for some great fish tacos I recommend. Theee was a stage so I assume there is music. Check website for more info.",

    "text": "After settling into our room at Circus Circus, the hubby and I agreed somewhere nearby for dinner would be best with our two toddlers.  Vince Neil's Tatuado seemed promising. This large restaurant is not terribly far from the West Tower where we were especially considering the ultra fast elevators.  On a Sunday evening, this place is not crowded at all.  A single guy with limited karaoke experience decided to sing just before we left. A country song no less. A Brooks & Dunn hit at that. Very strange choice if you saw this man. How I wish my ears could unhear it all. But one of our daughters is just like her grandmother and we end up waiting for her for everything. The Fart Around Queen, we call her. So of course we had to stay and listen to him then con her out of there by mentioning the Midway (arcade and circus acts) a floor above us.  FOOD - Bloody Mary ($9.75) was different. It had a fair amount of alcohol, but there was too much of something in it and I couldn't pinpoint what it was. Not my fav. - Iceberg Wedge Salad ($10.99) - very fresh. Good amount of bleu cheese dressing. But it wasn't just a wedge - it was the whole head of iceberg lettuce. Ha! Topped with diced tomatoes and bacon bits.  SERVICE I was a bit disappointed that our server, Martha, did not automatically know the soup of the day. Service was good other than that.  ENVIRONMENT The place could use a deep cleaning and some repairs (like our booth was off-kilter and a sharp edge was revealed). There is a nice large bar. Tables and booth seating. A separate nicer booth for Vince Neil and his entourage. And as alluded to earlier, karaoke.  PRICE Look, I'm grateful they even have a kid's menu, but $7.99 per entree plus an additional $2.95 for fountain drinks was a bit steep. Then my husband had a $15.98 bacon cheeseburger. He didn't comment on it so that usually indicates that it was a regular run-of-the-mill burger.  Overall, it's decent if you have a family to re-energize and don't want to wait very long on a Sunday night.  | Food: 3 | Service: 4 | Environment: 3 | Price: 2 |  2018 Challenge #105",

    "text": "Cheap steak and eggs on the strip in Circus Circus.  What can I say, we were playing in the midway at Circus Circus and my gf was craving for some steak and eggs. So who else comes into mind rather than Motley Crew!  Well the service wasn't that bad. Pretty attentive. However, the steak was really dry and chewy. However, we didn't really complain considering it was $8. Also the breakfast platter was $6.50 for pan cakes, eggs, sausage and sour dough toast.  Overall, the food is average. Nothing special here asides from the decoration and live music that goes on here. Definitely, more of a place to drink and watch live music rather then eat.",

We had sirloin with mash potatoes which were delicious and the ribs and fries...those were good. It did seem to take a while for us to get our food being that it wasn't busy. The waiters were friendly and DJ Miguel was great keeping the audience interacting with the karaoke singers. The restaurant is mostly family friendly however music videos are playing constantly and there were some really provocative that some parents may feel uncomfortable exposing their children to.#RoadtripUSA",

Even with the discount the meal was way over priced. Several of us in our party have been sick in the stomach since eating there. Not worth it even if it's free.

    "text": "Womp. Mullet lover's paradise. First time in Vegas, we got to our hotel (Circus Circus) very late and immediately headed to the first bar we saw...this one. We received a coupon for BOGO yard drinks here and couldn't wait to get one each! Well, we were completely disgusted by them! The bartender put SO much booze in each of the drinks, which doesn't sound like an issue, but it is when it's the equivalent of Georgi or 99 cent vodka. Then put some of the slushee, and more of the cheap booze on top. VOM (vomit). Even when we mixed it up it was absolutely disgusting, and not wanting to waste our money, had to force ourselves, like pinch our noses from tasting it, to get it down. Once we got halfway down and could mix it up more, the drink was finally okay to drink and gave us each a very nice buzz. We were starving and asked if we could have some food. \"Yeah sure!\" the bartender responded and as excitedly combed the menu. The options looked crazy, wanted to try the Krispy Kreme burger or the mac and cheese . After 10 minutes of excitedly looking and reaching a decision, the bartender tells us he's sorry, but the kitchen is closed. I do want to try their burgers, but this place skeeves me out. If you think TGIFriday's is living large, than you would probably enjoy this place.",

    "text": "Perhaps I set my expectations a bit too high for Vegas hotel eateries, or perhaps this place just sucks. A friend and I were visiting Vegas and staying at the Circus Circus hotel when our dinner plans suddenly cancelled. Hungry and tired of searching, we settled on just eating at the hotel. First, there was live music, which is to be expected at a Motley Crue restaurant. What was not to be expected was a man in leather chaps and a cowboy hat belting out country music. I'm sure many patrons would love this setup, however, my friend and I despise country music, so this was equivalent to sitting right at the gates of hell. Seeing as it was pretty late, we anticipated we wouldn't be there long so we stuck it out. I got the Mac and cheese, which took waaaaay too long to come out. We waited a while for the server to even come to the table so we were able to order immediately when he first arrived, then waited an additional 45 minutes for our food. The bacon in the Mac and cheese was way too salty, the plate was hot as if it were just thrown in the microwave, and the cheese looked like it had been sitting out a while. Not appetizing at all. We had a total of three encounters with the server: once to order, when he brought our food, and when we asked for the check.  In summary: long waits, terrible atmosphere, sub par service, and disgusting food.",

Service was less than average; server not engaged. Went back 7 am breakfast on Monday. Server was Kendra and she was awesome! Breakfast was good; nothing special, though.  Kendra was friendly, engaged and attentive. Great decor, lots of memorabilia, music videos playing on all screens. I wouldn't seek this restaurant out and I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, but if you're staying at Circus Circus, 7.99 steak and egg breakfast with server, Kendra, sounds good and maybe just wander around and look at the pictures!",

Vince Neil was there, definitely NOT your typical rockstar ,asshole. He came by the table ,shook hands, said hi, and took pictures. Very cool dude. As far as the entertainment, this guy Rob Benton was playing guitar and singing. Amazing!  You will not believe the talent. Seriously this guy can wail on a guitar with the best of them. Worth taking the time to go and see this guy play. Another very cool feature they have is the party bus outside of the restaurant it's a bar filled with beer taps and mixed drinks.

    "text": "The most poorly mismanaged place on earth, is located deep inside the Circus Circus. What started out as a great 80's themed bar-restaurant, has ended up as a loud tourist attraction. The first thing that you notice when you walk in, is the tribute to Vince and the Crue boys, which if you love the big hair era, you'll enjoy this. Girls at the podium can seat you at a table, or you can just get a seat at the bar. The second most obvious annoyance is the wrong amount of employees for each perspective area of the room. Two girls trying to work the entire dining area is ridiculous, and clearly wasn't happening, leaving most guests unattended, and inpatient. Most of the staff was in the back of house area doing a lot of nothing with no manager in sight to pick up the slack in the dining area. I sat at the bar thank god, because this was the only employee actually working and moving. She (SOFIA) was a bartender without a bar-back, no ice, no clean glasses, and lots of tickets for other orders. She was running circles around everyone else while doing her own bar-back duties. She introduced herself and got me a cold draft almost immediately, all with a smile. Maybe she should be running this place, because no one else was doing shit. My guess is that this joint is  Union staffed, because there is no guidance and direction. Everyone was clueless with the exception of the bartender. My beer was cold, and reasonably priced, all with a great view of the 80's music videos coming from the blurry tv's. I ordered another cold draft, and decided to walk around to soak up some of the atmosphere and pictures. Room temperature seemed warm, and the lighting was fine. By the time i got back, the bartender had all of her food orders up on the bar, including my tasty Fried Chicken. So I highly recommend sitting at the bar if you want fast service with a smile. (The tables out on the dining floor were still food-less and un-bused from previous diners. The bar was crowded for a reason, as this was the only place getting service. Definitely not a Chef's dream or Culinary standard buy any stretch. However, if they hire a more productive intuitive staff, they might survive. Two thumbs up to the game saver SOFIA. Other wise, this owner may want to seriously consider cleaning house......",

They said if they found it they would turn it into security. So security didn't have it and my boyfriend called to cancel his card because maybe he though he dropped it somewhere else.

If I stay at Circus Circus again, I won't be going back to this place.",

It we had to wait out front with all the empty tables we might have gone elsewhere. The food was surprisingly good for being in Circus Circus. We really didn't know what to expect and thought we might have to eat Mc Ds, or cafeteria food, ugh! To our surprise there was this very cool full on restaurant in the casino! I guess parents have to eat too. So the food...was sort of a mixed bag. I loved my wedge salad. Perfect amount of dressing and bacon! The adult pizza however was a little strange. It was sauce, pepperoni and cheese on a large hot dog type bun?! Not great. The burgers were good, and our 93 year old grandmother was so happy to see soup on the menu. The menu...was very extensive. Great selection, so there are bound to be some good, some not so much. Overall it was a good experience. They might want to have their music videos digitally remastered or something. It was like watching tv in the 80s, the picture quality was not great, but maybe that's what they were going for. The full 80s experience!",

One was with fried egg sunny side up, and the other was plain. Both were ordered medium. We had to wait 5 minutes until a server can get our drink order. Another long wait for 2 waters and sodas. And, another long wait until she can get our food order. After a long wait for our food, we thought it might be tasty. Mine was ok. But, the other burger was crap. The egg was not sunny side up, it was fried. The burger meat was rare and cold. When we notified our server after another long wait, the server argued with us that is how medium is done at their place. After this argument, they gave us replacement burger, the patty was at medium. But, the egg was not sunny side up again. How can they screw up an egg order, I don't know. The price is not worth the crap service and crap food. Avoid this place. Better bet is MCD in circus circus.",

We ended up staying longer than we had planned just to continue watching! The drink specials were also very reasonable. I will definitely come back here on my next visit to Vegas.",

I'm not a Motley Crew fan so the theme didn't do anything for me so my review is strictly service and food based. The service was slow, we had to wait for a hostess, wait for water and wait for food and refills. The food was okay and the prices were slightly high for the quality. Might be worth trying if you're a Crew fan but I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here because of the food.",

When we arrived the hostess mentioned that we had just \"missed the dinner rush\" (thank goodness for that!). 10 minutes after the hostess seated us, I had to ask the hostess to send over a server. When the server arrived she had mentioned that another server had \"gone on break without telling anyone\". When my (mis)stake arrived it had 3 different levels of cooked, from end to end: rare, medium rare (which is what I had asked for) and medium. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when I saw on the menu that it would be \"severed\", not \"served\" to me...  Then the \"entertainment\" began... Karaoke???!!! The first song (performed by the guy hired by the restaurant!) was NOT a Motley Crue song, but THE THEME SONG TO GILLIGANS ISLAND!!! Really??? The next song? \"You're gonna miss me when I'm gone\". Then he had his daughter sing a song from the musical \"Grease\"!!! Then he dressed up as a hot dog, but I had stopped listening at that point... After not seeing our server for about 15 minutes, we had to ask for our check, though I doubt anyone would have noticed if we had just walked out.",

Then we asked about the 2 for 1 yard coupon in the book we got when we checked in only to be told they don't do that anymore. Then they start karaoke music with a cowboy host singing country music, which I just don't care for. We thought we were going to just walk out, but decided to at least try the food to give a fair review and I am so glad we stayed. They turned a one star night into a 5 star night. I ordered the Krispy Kreme burger. It sounds funny but was one of the best burgers I have had. Our server Joe, was amazing. His goal was just to make us happy and he found two of those toilet bowl cups for us. As for the karaoke cowboy, he turned out to be so amazing we stayed the entire night. I didn't know we were going to get a show with our dinner. It ended up being one of the most fun nights I've had out with my best friend and we will definitely be back.",

This morning had a bit of a hangover and needed my go to hangover breakfast of chicken fried steak and eggs. Well they didn't have any due to ordering mix up. So I went with the scrambler of some sort and had to send it back as well as my wife's breakfast which was ham and eggs. Don't waste your time or money at this terrible excuse for a restaurant. The staff seemed as though they get this reaction a lot. I really don't expect much but if your going to charge premium prices even at a resort the food should be at very least good quality. I wouldn't feed this crap to my dogs. Does Vince know how terribly your food is? Probably never set foot in here and I don't blame him.

If I could find this person again, I would shake some sense into her. WORST SERVICE EVER!! The waitress took forever to take our drink order, got the order wrong...twice! There was only 1 other family when we got there, yet apparently the 3 other families that got there 20-40 mins after us were very lucky since they got their food first. We finally get our food after 40mins and the spinach dip has curdled so bad, it was a clumpy disgusting mess. When the manager finally comes over, his excuse is that it all depends on when the food order went in. Yeah right! How can someone who came in 30 mins after us get there food first if we had already been waiting 20mins for ours? Spinach dip apparently is way too complicated. After complaining, the waitress comes over to refill the kids' drinks and mixes my nephew's soda. She looks confused at the different colors she just mixed. Oh lord! It sucked from start to finish. The only reason we didn't leave half way through was that the kids were starving. I had to walk out since I didn't eat and couldn't stand the awful service. I wish I could shut this place down.

If it wasn't for the $7.77 breakfast, it would have been extremely overpriced breakfast and food options.  Seeing what everyone at my table got, the food is way over priced for the quality of what you get.  The coffee tastes like something you get at the tire shop while your waiting to get a flat repaired. And the jelly packets tastes like  they are at least a few years old as they are aluminum tasting.  Not to mention the fake butter packets....first ingredient vegetable oil.  Yum!!!!  Just like grandma use to make.  They didn't even make the rubber pancakes taste better.    Sadly a wasted meal experience in Vegas.  Words of advice.  Do not eat here.  Denny's would be a better option and that's terribly sad.  In general eat before you come to circus circus unless you want to be stuck with cafeteria food like options which will have you regretting it later.    Luckily our slow service allowed for some reflection time (one waitress for 9 tables).  When on vacation I will never sacrifice another meal in Las Vegas.  Vince Neal you should be ashamed of yourself for putting your name on such a shotty restaurant.  Shame on you dude......have you ever even been here ??? I dare you to come and eat breakfast and leave satisfied.  BS man.   You owe me $22 for a crappy meal.",

Then proceeded to sit us a few tables back from the stage. Then he came back, tossed the menu on the table and walked away. After waiting twenty minutes without being acknowledged - no water, no one bothering to take an order, I got up and left.  Worst experience of my Las Vegas trip.",

    "text": "We stopped by for a quick hand of blackjack and a drink-or-two. Tatuado has two casino adjacent bars, neither of which was filled with customers, notwithstanding a moderately-sized gaming customer crowd (on a Wednesday!)  We stopped by the u-shaped bar and ordered a near beer and a vodka cranberry.  I'm pretty certain that the near beer had more alcohol than the vodka cranberry.  The waitress looked bored to death and barely could muster the energy or enthusiasm to take our order or serve our drinks. After plunking down our drinks and refusing to engage us in any conversation beyond taking the order, the waitress wandered away to her cash register.  We decided to have a second drink (hopefully with some actual booze!) at the second bar just off the mid-stakes table games section. The bar tender was a muscle-bound meathead who was in deep conversation with some multi-color-haired skank, and we assumed that he'd break off trying to make time with the skank to pour us a few.  Nope.  We waited for about a minute-or-so, but the bar tender didn't break conversation with the skank, so we walked away. You'd think that someone working for tips would keep at least 1 eye on his bar, but this fellow had his back to us the entire time we were seated waiting for a little Las Vegas hospitality.  He wasn't even behind his counter, so it's no wonder he had no idea we were there.  While the $11 steak and potatoes breakfast seems like a great deal, I don't think I'll ever get around to taking advantage of that bargain. Who knows if the waitstaff would notice if I was there?  1 star for the service, .5 for the price of the drinks, .5 for memories of how neat CC used to be back in the day.",

I'm not exactly the biggest Vince Neil fan, but I'm a fan of all things Motley Crue :)  Poor planning on my part...I really wanted to check this place out for a meal, however I didn't make it down to Circus Circus till later in the evening but I was able to check this place out for a drink on a Monday night.  There was karaoke going on so we sat at the bar.  This place wasn't booming, but it wasn't dead either... the atmosphere was pretty chill, actually and I wouldn't have mind staying longer if I wasn't exhausted from my third night in Vegas if you know what I mean...  This place is way better than Vince Neil's place that either still is or was in the LV Hilton...it's pretty cool and if you're a Motley Crue Fan, you'd love it even more!!! Seriously...best and probably only Motley Crue themed bar!!!    I'm not a fan of karaoke, but it was actually pretty entertaining...the woman running it had a lot of energy and kept it entertaining.  Of all the places in Circus Circus, this place is definitely worth checking out and hanging out for a few drinks and maybe even a meal.",

We sat there for 10 minutes and not one server came over and helped us with drinks or even introduced themselves. I wasn't going to sit and wait after that so we left as another employee watched us leave without asking if we've been helped or at least trying to keep us there. I will not go back there again. Food isn't that good, service is terrible. Sad because the place looks really cool and it could be a nice restaurant but it is neglected in many areas...",

The menu is great - all sort of options to choose from - appetizers all the way through to dessert.   We started with nacho appetizers and they didn't disappoint.  A huge portion with all the toppings and the meat/chili sauce on it was insane good. For dinner I went with the Hombre Burger - a chorizo/beef mixture with guacamole, cheese and these weird little chip strips that gave it a nice crunch.  But the bun.  Oh that bun!  It was this soft bun with melted cheese and jalapenos on top.  To be honest?  I could have just eaten the bun and been totally satisfied.  I kid you not, rock star! At 7pm the party really starts.  Karaoke, anyone?  There's a big stage on one side of the restaurant and tables and booths surround it.  The karaoke master (I just made that title up but it's super appropriate) is a way talented dude who can belt out almost any genre and make it entertaining.  He was funny, engaging and even on a Sunday night didn't have to beg people to participate.   The restaurant is full of rock and roll memorabilia with tons of photo ops.  My particular favorite was the outfit displays and in particular, the one with the photo of 2 adult entertainers and the words \"I love single moms\" emblazoned across it.  Well, this is Motley Crue, guys!   I'm hoping this place does well.  It's got all the right features - good food, decent prices (slightly more expensive than a neighborhood restaurant but much less than most LV Blvd spots), a fun atmosphere and karaoke!  Tourists should take advantage of this unique joint and as locals, we'll most definitely be back!  Rock On!",

We ended up not getting the deal and ordered something else lol. It was a good niche to get people in.  I ordered the eggs benedict which came with tater tots. It was good! My Tater tots were crisp and I absolutely love Tater tots! Service was not too bad, wish our server checked on us more often. My S/O wanted a glass of water and I needed to flag him down for that.  The restaurant is full of Motley Crue memorabilia which was interesting to look at. Atmosphere was relaxed and casual. It's a convenient place to eat while staying at Circus Circus!",

    "text": "This was a super-confusing concept. This restaurant is inside Circus Circus. And, it must have been child karaoke night. It's probably not fair that I loath karaoke for starters, but, this was child-karaoke! Like, 5 years old & you cant even make out what the shy-mumbles are, it was embarrassing for everyone involved. There was nothing hard core rock & roll about this place. I just wonder if Vince Neil knows this is going on or if he just slapped his name on a Chuckee Cheese.  We stood a the host stand for a few minutes until a line formed behind us & eventually someone in a tie sat us. We sat at our table for about 10 minutes before a server noticed us. We had a Groupon & it appeared that everyone else around us did, too. 2 steaks w/ a bottle of win & a huge slice of cheesecake for $40 is pretty good, except that it turns out it was barely just OK. My husband ordered his steak rare, it came out medium to medium-well, so, not even close. The fries were good & the cheesecake was huge & tasty. Food came out quickly. But we scarfed it & took the bottle of wine home b/c we just wanted out of there! The karaoke was sooo horrid. Honestly, if kid-karaoke wasn't going on, I would have gladly given it more stars. We were miserable while we were there, but, now looking back, it was a laughing point in our trip.",

I think they nail it. I had been a waitress and bartender in a fast paced environment for most my life so I am picky when I give the staff good reviews and they get 5/5! Keep up the great job guys!

The drinks were totally cheap, our waitress was a delight and they had a fun DJ and karaoke - the whole experience brought us back to life!

I only finished half of it and took the rest Home for lunch the next day!  The amount of steak on my salad was very generous.  Everyone was happy with their food!

You can see crud in the corners on the floor that anyone who cared to could easily clean up...but I guess nobody cares to. The food seems old. My tacos were extremely dry (nobody likes a dry taco). Several items didn't match the description on the menu. For example, the menu specifically says items will come with tri-colored corn chips, but everyone got (stale) regular corn chips. My son's chocolate milk was supposed to be covered in marshmallows, according to the menu, but wasn't. These aren't huge problems, but just shows that they don't run a tight ship. The service was good, though. Everything else was disappointing.",

So we went to this new place expecting the same chill bar vibe. SOOOOOOO not the old place. This is in the casino from hell, Circus Circus - hey, if you like thousands of children running loose, have at this place, otherwise steer clear. Walked in to a gigantic family restaurant.    We thought we were at the wrong place. Vince Neil is not exactly what we call family friendly and that's one of the charms of the old place - it had amazing drinks and snacks, an excellent happy hour and NO CHILDREN.....and although we were hoping for the best, we walked into a huge, boring family restaurant with children everywhere.   The place is called Eat, Drink, Party.    Hard to do with crying 3 year olds and tired mothers in flipflops. We couldn't do it.   We wanted to, but we just couldn't.   We walked out.  Sad.   We're still mourning the old Tatuado.",

    "text": "You may have heard about the woman who complained to a restaurant that the food was inedible and the portions were too small. That is not the case at ViNCE NEiL'S. Looking for breakfast at Circus Circus, we found that many restaurants are only open until later. The Buffet? Maybe, but $13.95 for all I can eat? Which isn't all that much. A donut and coffee at Krispy Kreme isn't nutritious at all. So, I saw that Vince Neil's Tatuado (English translation - \"Tattooed\") was open for breakfast. They are tucked away in a far corner of the main level, far away from the front lobby and past the main casino. The place has somewhat of an \"industrial\" ambiance, said to be \"reminiscent of Sunset Strip rock clubs.\" Pictures of rock stars are all around and it does have a cool vibe.  There are several choices for breakfast plates, and they provide an abundance of food. I chose my favorite - chicken-fried steak, country style hash-browns and eggs. And toast. The steak was huge, nice and crisp, and covered in sausage gravy. Yum! My wife had French toast with strawberries and confectioners sugar along with two eggs. She said the strawberries were frozen, not fresh; a bit of a let-down. The others in our party had eggs with big sausage patties and pancakes, and an omelet.   The good part is that the coupon book provided by the hotel had a coupon good for $2 off each order, which saved us $8.00 - a very good deal. The food was good, more than some of us could eat, and a better deal than the buffet. You can't go wrong here.",

The food, coupon for the 2 8 inch strip steaks. Wife ordered hers medium, more well, they said they could do mine blue, but was beyond dried out and was 50 percent rubber with lots of grizzle and fat, more like a 2 ounce steak with crap on it. Thanks steak fries were cold with no seasoning, the fried veggies were mainly bellpeppers with a piece of zucchini. Disappointed wouldn't be the word, what has happened to Las Vegas? The wine was a cheap screw top white...steak is supposed to come with red....a joke of a special. Vince they are putting a crap product to your name. The last thing trying to take my picture at a meal is a no no.  I want peace and quiet. Never again",

Waited for 5 minutes but no waiter showed up at our table. We watched a couple of other waiters run around while we noticed people at other tables looking hungry and irritated at the lack of service. We got out of there soon after. By the way the hostess said \"I'm sorry\" you could tell that people walk away all the time.  The stuff on the walls were just regular old guitars. No pictures that you couldn't just see on the Internet or in a magazine. Can't tell you about the quality of the food or the portions, but the prices were standard Vegas rip-off overpriced rates. DON'T BLAME ME if you go there and it sucks because I warned you about this place! (I wish I could give it LESS then 1 star)",

The $39 steak dinner for 2 for example was just meh but for the price and it was adequate. You get a bottle of wine included with it but it's a $4 bottle of tisdale which is crap.  Our waiter had a bad attitude and offered us  white or red without asking if we wanted the cab, merlot, Shiraz etc   I guess with wine that cheap they all taste the same anyways but come on. My main complaint was that everything was dirty: water served in a grimy looking glass, wine glasses  were really cloudy, silverware crusty, table sticky.",

We had a party of 8 and we ordered appetizers, what a mistake. The spinach dip was so thick and salty you couldn't even scoop it out with a chip. The wine was an unknown brand that was horrible and the steaks were obviously their larger ones that had been cut in half for 8 oz. The cuts where are different sizes and even though all of the meat eaters ordered medium rare, each steak was a different temp! The tables, chairs, and menus where sticky and dirty and the only good part was our waiter was friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this to anyone!",

Neither disappointed me one bit. Then for the main course we had Rib Eye Steaks cooked medium, if your craving steak, this is your best bet. They were much bigger then I expected. The portion sizes were very generous for each item we ordered. Drinks were strong, and just what I was looking for. I really would like to add that this place exceeded my expectations, the customer service was excellent from beginning to end. Every hostess, waiter, and even the manager Ivan went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. You will not find many restaurants that can just make you say WOW, especially in a busy city like Las Vegas. If you are looking for a great reasonably priced place to eat that has good entertainment, and that is kid friendly in Vegas, this is your place. I will definitely be back.",

At the end when we asked if we could do split bills our server Elisabeth replied in a rude tone and said we couldn't that we should have said something in the beginning. Then came back with split bills. On our bills she was either charging us for things we didn't order or failing to charge us for certain items. She then came and took some cards to go pay but never came to get the card for the last bill. She proceeded to ignore us. We asked another waiter if he could help us and he said he would go tell her and then told us she would be on our way to finish our payment. About 10 whole minutes pass by and nothing. So we got up and went up to the bag and asked if we could pay our bill there. The bar attendant had some attitude as well and said no she wasn't our server but would go find ours. We finally got charged at this point. However Elisabeth was very rude seemed angry the whole time and unprofessional. Other than that the food wasn't bad the karaoke wasn't too successful but slightly entertaining and the music added some fun. Don't know if I'll be returning after how we were treated however.",

It's hard to talk bad about the food. It's safe, but it doesn't wow. It simply served the purpose of being edible and filling me up..  All in all, the only thing more depressing than the lack of an atmosphere and the worst margarita in the history of alcohol itself were the looks of self-deprivation on each of the employees faces.

I had ordered a medium well steak but I got a fairly rare steak. my boyfriend had ordered a medium rare steak and his steak came out to be well done, it was really tough and dry. The burger my brother in law had ordered was not what was described in the menu. Honestly you could get a better burger else where, like In-N-Out. the food is SO NOT worth the price. In my opinion, I feel like the quality and taste of the food is less than mediocre. Not to mention I have asthma and the smoke from the cigarettes that people smoke in the casino is so overwhelming and you can still smell it strongly in the restaurant. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone and I would not come back here again. The food is gross, it is expensive, it smells, and you can get better food elsewhere. You're better off at McDonald's.",
