And if any later, you would assume someone would call to say so. Nope!  Waited for over an hour & a half and still received no food. Finally decided it wasn't worth the wait & cancelled. Really disappointed because there are other great reviews for this place. Maybe next time!",

    "text": "Based on \"iffy\" reviews on delivery, we decided on calling ahead and picking up on a wednesday evening. We ordered a pick-up special 16\" cheese pizza, a 18\" Philly, garlic balls, and Zeppoli . It didn't list sauce on the Philly online, so we asked for white sauce on it... which they totally forgot. Wait time was an accurate 30 minutes.  They only have one crust option. It's very thin with a slightly thicker edge.  . Not dusted with flour or cornmeal. It was also very chewy, and way too tough for my liking. Flavor was very plain... comparing to saltine crackers.   Toppings were of decent quality/flavor, but the cheese was SUPER greasy. Dripping off the pizza.   When we picked up our order and paid, they forgot our garlic balls, so we pointed it out and one of the guys went back, got a bagged box and brought it out to us. It was barely warm. The pizza and Zeppoli were hot... so they made the garlic balls before the pizza? I don't know. I didnt mention it and took our stuff home. After trying one of them, I realized they were dry... the cheese wasn't even melted on them... and they were hard, or overcooked, or something. I hate using the term \"inedible\" since I freaking love food, but I couldn't eat these. :(  Zeppoli was tasty, and the kids loved them. Can't go too wrong with fried balls of dough with powdered sugar on them though!  Overall, I was very dissapointed. Usually my family of four happily stuffs face... but we still have half of each pizza and all the garlic balls leftover.   On the upside, they have a very impressive selection of food ranging from pizza, pasta, salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta, chicken and ribs, and desserts.  I lowered my rating from 2 to 1 star for the location itself...it doesn't even have a sign on the storefront, was kind of dark/dirty and run down for a new restaurant. Also it is pick up & delivery ONLY. So I will not likely be recommending or ordering from them again.",

So, the moral ofnthe review, Pelligrini and the the staff are awesome and the food delcious!  (Disregard the following)  The young lady that took my call was helpful and friendly.  Explained what was popular and what her favorites were.  I ordered well done fried wings and when my wings came they were half baked wings. The young lady also told me how great the onion rings were so I ordered them.  They weren't delivered,  but I paid and ordered them.  I guess I am upset because I am really hungry and disappointed.",

The dish is one of the most expensive items on the menu, and was supposed to include shrimp, clam and crab with sauce on top of pasta.   The delivery driver showed up, I tipped him and he left. I opened the dish, and it was very hot (one star for the driver for being so quick). Unfortunately, the shrimp was way over cooked. Oh well, I could get past that, probably my fault for ordering delivery anyway.   What I couldn't get past was the fact that the dish didn't include crab, but krab (i.e. fake crab substitute). Krab can be good in certain things, but on top of this seafood pasta, it was revolting! Ruined the whole dish. I felt lied to. If I knew it was going to be krab, I would never have ordered it.",

With that said, I was VERY happy to have found this place! Their menu is enormous and they have something that will please everyone. It's also very affordable, and they even deliver (with a minimal $1.50 delivery fee! what!?). With so many choices it was actually to pick one entree, however the staff was happy to offer their insights.  Speaking of the staff, they were extremely friendly and offered plenty of recommendations on their favorite dishes. My husband and I ended up eating inside the restaurant (which they are in the process of expanding, exciting!) and it was very clean. After listening to some recommendations, we ended up with garlic knots, mac and cheese, and stuffed shells. Being first time customers, they even gave us a 10% discount. It was very sweet. After quickly paying we took a seat.   Within 20 minutes we had received all of our food, and let me tell you, there was a lot of it! There were almost 20 little garlic knots, which I highly recommend if you go, plus huge portions of mac and cheese along with many stuffed shells. Both entrees even came with garlic bread (which we didn't realize so we ended up with so much bread!). Neither my husband or I could finish everything. We ended up with lunch for the next day. Love this place. Definitely recommend!",

Their Pellegrini pizza is their signature item and it was delicious. The pizza was pretty meaty and the artichoke complemented the flavor. The crust was soft, but it did not bother me. The Hawaiian side was also very juicy, I'm really a fan of their cheese!  We also ordered the garlic fries which were  good, but nothing crazy.  Also dont forget to get your 15% off with your yelp check in. Overall, the pizza was good and very tasty, I would totally recommend it. The only bad thing is that it is only a delivery or pick up establishment.",

Came earlier than promised, they said 1 hour it was delivered in 30 minutes.  FYI the pizza delivery guy super hot   food arrived hot and fresh.  I guess I got lucky today because they were having a special on the tenders today and I am Glad I got them.  The tenders are all white meat and very little breading, juicy and flavorful, the pizza? Yessss.  Thin crust, nice chewy edges, great quality cheese and the sauce was the perfect balance of flavors (I hate sweet pizza sauce) weird that I am about to mention their ranch dressing but it is really good!!   Great neighborhood pizza place that delivers to the afternoon zombies on sundays.  Can't wait till game days you guys better get ready for me.",

I noticed a smell coming from the pizza box a potpourri perfume kind of scent which was very unusal but no biggie didnt think much of it. After eating a slice i couldnt get the taste of perfume out of my mouth. Yuck it made me sick to my stomach!! And if that isnt bad enough it was soggy and undercooked. Just really crappy pizza. So then i called grubhub to let them know they told me the restaurant refused to give me my $32 refund. At least grub hub stepped up and gave me a $10 coupon code via email due to this paid by cash. Bottom line horrible experience i will never be ordering from this restaurant again.",

    "text": "After finding one of their flyers on our door, we decided to give them a try, and we are glad we did.  Being as we have a hungry family, and we like left over pizza, we opted for the 30\" pizza with pepperoni and some garlic balls.  My wife placed the order on-line which went smoothly, and we chose to pick it up since they are only a couple of blocks from our house.  This also save us $5 on the pizza and the $3 delivery charge.  The only \"issue\" with the on-line order was after checking out it said our order would be ready in 10-30 minutes which I felt was quite a spread, kinda like the cable company when you need an install done.  In defense of Pelligrini, it was a third party web site so it's probably not their fault.    We decided to split the time and headed down to pick up our order 15 minutes after ordering.  When we got there we got a friendly greeting from a few of the employees. The guy at the register told us our order would be ready in about 10 minutes, and he was pretty close, it took 12 minutes.  Good enough for me.  The place was clean and had one table with a couple of chairs and a bench to sit on.  It's definitely a take out place so don't go expecting to sit down and eat. While waiting more employees came in to go to work and we received a friendly hello from them as well, which I thought was nice.    Our order was brought out and the first thing to pop into my head was, \"Damn, this is one huge pie\"  I mean to the point we had to take it home in the trunk of the car.  Get  the pizza home, grab a couple of slices and a few of the garlic balls and sit down to eat.  The pizza was quite good.  The crust was thin, but not cracker thin, and was light not doughy like other places.  The next time we order, I'll ask them to cook a bit longer as I like a little crunch to my crust, but that's personal preference.  The sauce had a good flavor and the cheese was good quality.  The pizza had an ample amount of pepperoni, to the point every bite I took had some.     Now onto the garlic balls.  These were quite good,  but I think they could have used a bit more garlic, but that's just me.  The outside crust was nice and crisp and the inside was light and soft.  Definitely with the $4 bucks.  While not the best I've ever had, overall it was very good and we will be ordering from them again.",

We get the pepperoni and the potato and herb and the latter is my favorite. The crust is perfectly chewy, and the cheese/sauce ratio is on point. Excellently priced! I have paid far more for far less superior pizzas. My only complaint is that the pizza is very greasy... by the time my husband and I had made the 10 minute drive home with our pizzas, there were already huge grease puddles bleeding through the sides of the boxes. It's nothing a quick paper-towel blot can't fix though :)",

The more I order from them, though, the worse it gets. The salad is never the same from each time I order. They have tomatoes, then next time none or they'll have a ton of olives and next time only a few. The pizza, most of the time, I have to use my own pizza cutter because they only grazed the top of it. The last pizza I ordered looked like they put the cheese mostly in the middle and probably half an inch to an inch from the crust was no cheese. Once, I had gotten a pizza that was really burnt. I wasn't happy. The food is great, but I think because of the inconsistencies with the quality and quantity I will not be ordering from them again.",

Usually a pizza place has different items on it's menu but most of them do pizza well but not other items. Was pleasantly surprised with Pellegrini's tho. I've tried about 5 different items on the menu besides pizzza. Love the ribs. Steak bomb sandwich was killer too. So I'm working my way through the menu with some confidence now.

We ordered a pie, wings, fries and everything was above our expectations and we did expect good food based on a friends recommendation. The 7.99 pie is an incredible deal and its obvious they use top knotch fresh ingredients. The cheese, meat, sauce, crust everything was good but those meatballs is what had me in love, they were delicious almost tasted like gyros. We got meatballs and mushrooms. The wings were hands down the best wings i have ever eaten, we grabbed 20, taste wise they were phenominal crispy, spicy, meaty but what surprised me most is they tasted just as delicious the next day being reheated. It didnt habe that nasty smell most reheated chicken gives off. The fries, hands down best fries I have ever had. The entire meal left me satisfied but not bloated and like i just ate 10 tons of salt. Beyond that both ladies up front were complete sweethearts. I will be back, my entire family will be back, often. I look forward to trying out the entire menu. I may not be an elite reviewer but im from Chicago and pride myself in knowing good food, and these guys got delicious food all around so far.",

I ordered a white pie and they sent me something called a Pilgrim.  I called and the manager asked for the wrong pizza back, but was quick to blame the driver.   The manager made the new pizza herself and somehow i still ended up with another Pilgrim.  I had her on speaker, so my entire party heard her confirm WHITE PIE.  When i called back, she lied and said a white pie was never discussed.   I promised her a yelp review and hung up.   To add insult to injury, she called back and insisted on arguing more.   Never have i experienced such terrible service on what was really a sub standard pizza.",

    "text": "I placed my order via Yelp around 7 pm. My growling stomach reminded me to look at the clock and it was 8:24 pm already so I decided to give the restaurant a call in case my order didn't reach them. They told me they received my order around 7:30 pm.. The gal on the other end ensured me it has already left and should be at my place any moment since technically it has only been one hour since they got my order, not an hour and a half according to my calculations. I didn't make a big deal because I thought maybe they were really busy. I hung up and waited some more... Then it was 9 pm. I called back and by now I am upset because I AM FREAKING HUNGRY! .. The same person put me and hold, and of course within a few minutes, there was a knock at my door.  The pizza delivery guy told me he tried to call but couldn't get thru to me (probably bc I was dialing the restaurant!!!! )  Bottom line: 1 1/2 - 2 hours is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS for delivery especially if you are down the street... If you are slammed then call your customer and just inform them and be upfront. The pizza and wings are COLD and soggy. I cannot stand that!  I am writing this review as I am waiting for my oven to preheat so I can heat up my pizza and hopefully get a decent crust. Perhaps this is an isolated incident.. This place had good reviews and that's why we decided to order thru them. Here's to heating up my LONG awaited pizza and wings after waiting 2 hours for delivery. For the price, it should of been at least within a decent time range.",

No Pellegrino's.  I had hoped to change this review. The manager of the store called me immediately after I posted my review and he was very apologetic for my pizza not being on point. A really nice guy! ( Thus the one star increase in my review). He told me to call the store next time and that they would comp me a pizza. So I called tonight to order in hopes that my faith would be restored in their pizza. Well they had no record of this and wouldn't do as they promised. That is poor business practice. I'll find another pizza place to squelch my pizza cravings.",

Delicious! Amazing! I will definitely order it again.",

    "text": "We received a flyer for Pellegrini on our door one day and now frequent this pizza spot a couple times a month. They have a pickup special for a one topping 16\" pizza for $7.99. The pizza will feed at least 2 and there will likely be leftovers. They also have $1 chicken fingers on Sunday and Monday. The boyfriend and I can eat dinner for under $20, which is a win in my book!   We usually get a pizza and then an order of fingers or wings plain with the sauces on the side. My favorite is their house sauce which blends teriyaki, bbq and hot sauce into one. It's a little sweet and a little spicy, but for sure a new favorite of mine. Add a side of fries for only $1. Ranch is homemade as well so bonus points for that. We also really like the meatballs. 6 come in an order and they are smothered in house made marinara. We'll keep coming back.",

The food was definitely delicious! We were all impressed and super happy. I usually am able to down two pieces of pizza, but because of the huge slices, I couldn't. I was so full but definitely satisfied!   This was our first time ordering here, & it definitely won't be our last!",

My order did not arrive until almost 1045, and when I opened it up I realized it was a hamburger with no cheese, no bacon and no katcup, but there appeared to be extra mayo.  Of course, since it was so late they were unable to have it redelived.  So I waited about 1 hr and 45 minutes for something I was unable to even take a bite out of.",

My only advice would be to actually call and order instead of going through the Eat24 app because it messes up the way the orders are read.",

The wings this time were really good, no longer dry and gross, seriously improved!  The pizza is still eh.. Thin and really really greasy, the cheese coagulates weirdly, its never ooey gooey and yummy  like pizza should be. the flavor is really really heavy on the Thyme taste, possibly rosemary? I dont know im not an herb expert but it tastes weird.  I may order from here again for wings but wont be trying the pizza again. Im glad they got better, but they are still very mediocre",

    "text": "Wow- we were so surprised by the quality of food. We ordered delivery for the one-topping, 12 medium buffalo wing, and 2 liters of Coke.   The pizza was a thin, limp, greasy, sad specimen that easily split into a congealed latticework of \"cheese\" and \"bread\". There was no tomato sauce.   The wings were cooked hard and were so plain we had to go on a buffalo sauce search. We found about a teaspoon's worth, most of it stuck on the backside of the foil.   Dipping sauce came with the wings. It wasn't blue cheese. It wasn't ranch. It actually reminded me of the homemade French onion powder you mix with sour cream.   The only thing I wasn't disappointed with was the Coke.   We took pictures so you wouldn't think we were lying.  UPDATE: On  April 21, 2014 I was notified by Yelp that my photos of the pizza and wings had been removed because the photos and captions weren't \"generally representative of the business.\" I'm hoping that means my terrible experience was one-in-a- million!",

I made my kid's plates and after I made my plate and bit into my chicken wing I noticed that it was completely bloody and raw on the inside! I immediately called the restaurant to inform them of what happened and they were VERY rude to me! And never even apologized or showed any concern about the fact that me and my kids just ate raw chicken (which is UNSAFE!). The male employee yelled at me and asked me why the hell would I let my kids eat raw chicken? He also went on to basically tell me I was lying because he knows how their oven works (as if I care ! ) I explained to him that I have ordered from them in the past and I wasn't calling to start a fight I simply just wanted my money back! They refused. The lady employee offered me more chicken wings and I told her I didn't want anymore food from them. Then the male employee got on the phone telling me that I must get back in my car and drive 30 minutes to return it or he wasn't giving me anything! He said I didn't know what I was talking about. He said it was most likely barbeque sauce! As if I don't know the difference between blood and barbecue sauce! Needless to say I will NEVER order from them again! And this is just a portion of everything that was said and how poorly they handled the situation.",

I paid for extra artichoke and asked to sub chicken for ground beef. There was exactly the same amount of artichoke as a normal order and in total maybe an ounch of chicken on the whole 18 inch pizza. It came off as being short changed. I'll be giving another chance and I hope it doesn't happen again. But if it does I'll be be looking to spend my money elsewhere. I definitely won't be getting dessert here again as the slices are absolutely tiny. 2 star  UPDATE: 11 October  We tried it again with the same pizza and the same order. We were encouraged by a manager at the store to give them another try with a large discount. We ordered the same pizza and it was wonderful! Changing to a 4 star vote. Also: order delivery over the phone instead of through grub hub. Their driver is significantly nicer than any I've had through grub hub.",

I ALWAYS tip the drivers. I'm not an asshole and I've been a consistent customer of Eat24 for YEARS. I've never had a problem like this before. Tonight I got the garlic knots, fries, and an eclair. Garlic knots were overcooked and burnt, fries were wet and soggy, eclair was also overcooked and kind of old looking.   Because I am pregnant, I didn't want to go through the stress of calling the restaurant myself. Call me crazy, but whatever. I wasn't about to fight with a restaurant owner over food when I have a growing fetus inside of me ok? So I messaged eat24 instead and hoped they would deal with it for me. Eat24 customer support is always super sweet and easy to talk to, so they were more than willing to help me out. They understood my concerns and really just wanted to make sure that me and my unborn child were safe.   Eat24 called the restaurant and told me that the restaurant owner said he \"cooked the food perfectly.\" Um what? He said he cooked it himself so he was sure that it was cooked to perfection. I don't know how he can be so arrogant and rude. Especially over a $13 order. If he had just comped the meal, I'd probably order from here again in the future and order even more food, like I usually do. But now I'm just never going to order from here ever again. How stupid of them to do business this way. NEWS FLASH: PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST TRYING TO GET A FREE MEAL OUT OF YOU FOR NO REASON. Don't be arrogant about your fucking food and don't pretend like you know more about what good food is than your customers do.   The reason why I keep using Eat24 is because they CONSISTENTLY provide me with GREAT customer service and always take my concerns seriously. That's how you stay in business and how you keep getting money from customers. Providing good customer service will get customers to return to your business instead of turn them away.   In other words, I'M NOT FUCKING STUPID SO DON'T TREAT ME LIKE I AM. You're actually lucky I'm smart enough to know what good food is. Because if I wasn't, I would have eaten it, gotten sick, and then I would have sued you for putting my pregnancy at risk, asshole.",

I have never been a big burger person myself, but it has become a staple now everytime we place an order. Super filling and cooked perfectly, it satisfies even my boyfriends huge appetite. Can't say enough good things about this place, if you haven't ordered from here before I suggest you check it out. Can't beat delicious affordable food. (:",

As this was the first time we tried the Good Greek we were a bit dissappointed.  The meat would have definitely helped and maybe a tzatziki sauce drizzled on top since the white sauce base was lacking.  That said, this is still our favorite local pizza joint, but we wouldn't order the Good Greek again.",

And I gotta say the price was right, the fries were crispy and the pizza was awesome. Way better than those large chain pizzas that are made 2go. Other than that cashier being  a little hard of hearing( having to repeat myself over and over),The food was great. But they only get 4 stars because of lack of seating... there were two round tables with two chairs at each one. A little constructive criticism would be to push back that cashier's cage and put a few more tables.",

Don't butcher pizza it ruins the eating experience! But they did make it up and delivered us another one on the house!  Now that's what you call customer service!

The toppings looked like the prepackaged stuff from store and they didn't put much of it on either. It tasted fine though. They gave a 10% discount for first time customer so saved like $4, but I'll take it. The breaded mushrooms weren't the best I've had but they tasted good. Really nothing to complain about for this place. The food was good and it was ready when they said it would be. My reason for giving three stars is because I feel three is average. There is much room for improvement in my opinion, by I also haven't eaten everything on their menu so I can't give them less than that either.",

The cheese is okay but the crust was hard and it didn't taste fresh like it had been a reheated pizza, thrown back in the oven to melt the cheese or something.  I called it in and arrived 10 mins before the 45-minute window as advised and waited for 5 minutes.  I live 5 minutes away and the pizza was barely hot and that is why I think it was a reheat and not fresh.  I ordered Garlic Parmesan chicken wings and they are drenched in some white sauce and sprinkled with white cheese and parsley.  I couldn't even taste the Garlic or parmesan cheese.  $30.00 wasted.  I usually order pizza across the street at Verrazano Pizza and it is awesome but I thought I would give this a try.",

I'll say it is a better quality than Little Caesars but nothing to rave about. It's the step up from fast food pizza that you would want to eat when you've had a few beers but probably not any other time. They ordered a Supreme but I stuck to the cheese. It's not a particularly hearty pizza, and the crust was a little bland. The quality of cheese was better than expected. Let's say it was a sufficient pizza for four engineers working through their lunch. We may do takeout from here again but I'll want to explore other options before deciding the drive is worth it.",

    "text": "Failure of a pizza place. First time I ordered through uber eats my delivery never arrived but I was still charged full price. Upsetting, but that doesn't mean it was the restaurant's fault. Decided to try again a few weeks later through grubhub. Food arrived was old. OLD! the crust alone was prehistoric overcooked and 0 flavor on the pizza despite paying extra for 3 so called quality toppings. The chili fries I ordered were okay. Same as the pizza very bland chili. I had already resolved to never order from them again but went to a friends house who was picking up pizza. Pick up! Yet once again the pizza was horrible I dont understand the reviews for this place, three separate occasions and Pelligrini had yet to deliver anything palatable let alone worthy as being considered a good pizza spot for late night cravings. I have been fooled too times too many. Avoid this place please.",

    "text": "I was skeptical when I first ordered from here. I'd gotten used to the pizza place that occupied this space previously. I have to admit that my loyalty was easily changed. The pizza was hot and cheesy and gooey and delicious. I ordered 4 times in one week after my first order. Not gonna say I ate here everyday for 3 of those 4 days but I did.  What really got me was the customer service. My boyfriend and I ordered the pickup special and the wings lunch item with one extra drink. We called at 11am right when they opened and they let us know it would take time as the ovens had to heat. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and was getting really hungry but I don't mind waiting for quality food. We waited the appropriate time and I sent my bf to go pick everything up. He came home with the wings and the drinks minus the pizza. I was pregozilla at that point and was like \"where is the pizza.\" It turns out that the ovens didn't cook the pizza evenly and the restaurant didn't want to give us a subpar pizza. They offered to make us a new one and deliver it to us for free. I was annoyed but it understood and set on the wings and fries while we waited. 10 minutes later the pizza was delivered and they threw in a couple drinks for the inconvenience. The pizza was literally so hot that I picked up a slice and piping hot cheese started oozing off of the slice back into the box. I was so surprised I burnt my finger trying to catch the cheese to eat it. It was delicious! I let the pizza cook down a little before going back at it. Me, my bf and our daughter literally ate the entire pizza in 20 minutes. I can say I've had some great customer service experiences and some great food experiences but I rarely have them so closely connected. I appreciate the quality food produced here. The pizza, wings, fries, and chicken tenders are all amazing. I can't wait to try more of the food they have to offer!",

Normally that would be a bonus, but the salads layout just didn't look so good. The taste was just off to me. Might just be me though ! I just wanted leafy greens, tomatoes, and you know basic garden salad. Somehow I missed this, on this particular salad.  Next ,the pizza was really thin, which was awesome for us!

Both the sandwich bread and the actual meat was over cooked and under sauced. The veal one was very mushy.   The garlic fries were very greasy.  The garlic knots are definitely something you can skip. There wasn't anything great about them.  I get why my husband keeps going back. When the food is done well, it's great. Other nights like tonight make me never want to go back. Let's just say I'm not feeling so hot. Tonight is one of those nights where I never want to order from them again.",

It was really good. I am usually skeptical about small pizza shops and usually wondering if they have a B or lower grade, but when I went to pickup my pizza I noticed on the wall an A rating. Well the health department was not wrong, and I would give this place 4 stars. So if you are looking for a yummy pizza I suggest trying this place.",

The man who took the order made sure I knew that the lemon garlic wings were not saucy, but seasoned, which I appreciated. The wings were not for me, so I can't comment on them.  The pizza was pretty good. Better than Little Caesars or Dominos and similar places. Not like Sammy's or Settebello, but they deliver :) I would order from them again.",

I currently have two fav pizza joints to go to know between sabitino's pizza and Pellegrini Pizza there both really amazing places.   I had Philly Cheese steak pizza and funnel fries ..  First off let me start off buy saying get an order of funnel fries !! I haven't seen alot of places that do this and here there amazing some even have a carmel texture to them after the powder sugar sets in -- if I could cause this is where I would inset text and say there f ing amazing seriously really good. -- only thing you need with this is a nice pilsner   Pizza was really good too these are not what you call light pizza's I tend to think more on the heavy side for a definition meaning crust and dough is heavy witch is good and bad the bad meaning normally you can only eat about 2-3 slices before getting stuffed however taste and flavor was really good -- normally on a philly pizza its a little overly salty or bland tasting it stood up really good.   They have a huge menu amount of menu items ranging from popcorn shrimp,fried rav, lots of sandwich's, burgers and large dessert menu cannoli's.  This place is worth checking out at least once and forming your view. There prices are just right and not crazy lie some I have seen.  They also offer delivery and coupon threw eat 24 and I think they do grubhub.",

I even got some Funnel Fries to splurge and was supper happy with the turnout.   The whole ordering process is pretty basic and straightforward, for pickup anyways. I did see that they offered Delivery. If I remember right they even were on Postmates, Uber Eats, and Grubhub.   The wait was 20-25 minutes, I showed up on time and everything was ready and all I had to was pay, the atmosphere was nice, the workers were awesome. The lady who took my order also cashed me out, showed me the pizza that looked delicious.   I will most definitely be coming back here, also right down the street from me so it's super convenient!",

    "text": "Sometimes it isn't always about the food. Most times, it's about the experience.  I love za.  My wife hates it.  They say opposites attract and nothing could be more polarizing about our relationship than over pizza.  I did my usual search for pizza, but wanted to try something new.  I found some great reviews about Pellegrini and decided to make the 25 minute drive to pick up my order.  Calling along the way, the person taking the order suggested getting the Take-Out special, which offered a 16\" cheese pizza to start and then build the toppings, which was about a $5-6 difference in cost from the 18\".  Awesome.  It was a phone call and already they hooked me up with a special.  I walked in and after the usual chit chat, took a chair across from Arthur, who I learned was the owner.  I've sold into fast casual and quick service for quite some time now.  On a daily basis, I talk to restaurant owners who gave me so much insight and respect into what they do.  No one sacrifices more than a restaurant owner.  It's an unforgiving, demanding, beat-you-down job that doesn't end when you close for the evening.  Most owners I meet are tired.  A few wake up and realize that they've raised their kids beneath kitchen tables and missed all their life's highlights.  Arthur was no different and our brief 15 minute conversation was easily the most rewarding conversation with a restaurant owner I've had in months.  Arthur hails from Boston.  This is his second location.  The first is by 95 and Rainbow.  We got into a conversation about clam chowder and how if he had that on the menu, I'd live happily at his store.  He confided in me that he had traveled the coast from Maine to Cape Cod learning, conversing, researching and testing the best clam chowder you could find on the East Coast.  He used to make it every day at the other store.  When his time constricted and he couldn't maintain the quality of the chowder, he took it off the menu.  I commiserated with him on the hardships of finding good talent - someone who would open/close on time and not take shortcuts on the menu in a town where the very same talent could get twice the pay on the Strip.  No one wants to make the sacrifice anymore.     Let's take a step back and take a hard look - he's working on a Sunday night with a very young family at home.  Sacrifice, people.  Finding it is like finding a unicorn in your back yard.  I ordered the pizza and some breaded mushrooms.  East Coast style pizza.  Foldable and, for this pie, easy on the oil.  Trouble with a lot of East Coast pizzas are that the cheese to bread ratio is unbalanced, so as the pizza cooks the oils seep through the crust and collect on the bottom of the box.  I believe that a good East Coast pizza is one that has that figured out, where theres enough of the cheese flavor to carry through the crust - unless the crust is supposed to stand on its own. Overall, the pizza was good, with the Italian sausage sliced instead of in chunks - I prefer it with chunks.  Arthur and I reminisced about the addition of chorizo to the pizza like they do in Southern Massachusetts/Rhode Island/Connecticut - where the heavy Portuguese influence lays into the culinary scene.  Overall, great experience, awesome conversation, and good pizza.  I recommend Pellegrini Pizza!",

We ordered a to go pizza and order of garlic knots, needless to say, they were so dry and flavorless, my fat pregnant ass couldn't even finish one slice! And that says a lot, because I love food!  The pizza was so greasy and the knots had no garlic butter on them! They were burnt, little balls of bread. They were tough and dry, my son almost choked on one!  We ordered and were given a time to arrive and we were there a bit later and still had to wait!!  There was someone who showed up like 5 minutes after us, and got their pizza before us... like wtf?  Anyway, this is a strong pass from us! The food was just, horrible.",

They have create your own too, so if you have certain toppings that you like, they'll do it!  We had the Greek style pizza which was a white pizza that had lamb, olives, spinach, tomatoes, and more that I'm probably not thinking of!  I also had the corn that had the sweet buffalo sauce on it - it was super good! The pizza was great. The lamb was really tasty and it had a perfect amount of cheese and sauce. The frost was nice and crispy but not overdone.  Overall this place was great! They're big on delivery too.",

    "text": "First night in Vegas, after a long trip we were looking for a quick bite. We though about trying Pellegrini Pizza since it was close by.  The prices are very cheap, and indeed, like some of the reviews said, the GARLIC Knots are definitely worth it.  I ordered  Greek Pizza.... White sauce, fetta... But they really exaggerated in the amount of olives (green and black). Honestly if I were to name this pizza I would call it Olive Pizza bc it took over the flavor of the pizza and it was really overwhelming.  Friends ordered sandwiches and they were very happy. The one that ordered pasta had to really wait for his order to arrive. They seen super busy and have lots of take out. So again, this is a good choice if you're looking for an \"economic\" place to eat.  If you do come to this place, try the garlic knots.",

We ordered the Pilgrim, Pellegrini Special, and BBQ chicken with pineapple pizza, 52 chicken wings (Garlic Parmesan, Medium Hot, and Luisiana Dry Rub), garlic fries, garlic knots, some sodas, and dessert (tiramisu, red velvet, and chocolate cake. They all tasted very delicious. We placed the order on the phone prior to getting there so the wait wasn't so long. Our bill wasn't as bad as I thought especially when you check in with YELP and they give you a 20% off your entire bill.  If I could give these guys a 10 star, I would because the staff was so friendly and helpful. The manager or owner went outta his way to run to the store and buy candles for my son without me knowing. The chocolate cake that my son ordered was complimentary and they hit the lights when it was time and sang happy birthday. These guys are amazing and I would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you for making this night so convenient and relaxing.",

I am the first person to embrace and appreciate a business for their very hard work, because I have myself managed a cafe before.  We ordered a pizza with sausage and mushrooms, wings and chicken tenders. The pizza probably started with a pretty ok thin crust but there was very thick soggy cheese and sauce was hardly noticeable. The sausage was unappealing.  The chicken wings were very dry and chicken tenders were covered in a sauce but the meat was like something left over from another dish.  I want to see this place look at what could have happened.   I would be willing to try again because I want to cherish my neighborhood, but I could have had a$7. frozen pizza and been satisfied.",

We were totally blown away by how buttery and garlicy the crust was, how melted the cheese was, and how reasonably priced this spot is! An added bonus is they serve the calzone with a big container for marinara so you'll for sure have enough  The picture I attached doesn't do it the justice it deserves!

    "text": "I'm a fan of visiting small businesses occasionally. I work a few blocks from here, and occasionally visit the shopping center. It's usually for a car wash. Now, I can kill 2 birds with one stone.  Today was my local business day. As I checked out the business on Yelp, and seeing how they stand behind their product, I HAD to check them out! The restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center on the South East corner of Rainbow and Westcliff.  After checking out the lunch specials, I can't wait to get through the list! I started off with the 10' Pizza and drink. #1 on the menu. I had enough food for lunch and dinner. I'm a simple man and love a good pepperoni pizza. This was the best I've had in Vegas! It was made hot and fresh. Thank you for the desert! I chose Chocolate Cake! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  They are located very close to Fremont Street. If you're staying in Downtown, it's a $7.00 Uber ride. If you're at Mandalay Bay, maybe $20.00 ride.  The service was so good, I wish I could give them 10 Stars! I sat at a table, expecting to walk up when my name was called, I was surprised to have my lunch delivered to my table!  Cleanliness is very important to me. I was amazed at how clean they were.  This is the perfect place to watch sports! There are TV's everywhere.  I'm glad I found Pellegrini Pizza! I'm going to try every lunch special. I'll post pictures!  Don't pay tourist prices. I don't care if you're from California, Chicago, or New York, check them out! Fresh ingredients, awesome taste, great service, and clean restaurant. I highly recommend this business!",

Their hot wings are also really good too as well as their spaghetti. The service is always great. Everyone is so friendly every time I call or dine in.

That's when we get cold food.....the tracker was down again today for lunch delivery BUT we got hot food,  so I figure shift change and the manager/owner is still there. Please fix your tracker cause your food is the BOMB !!!!  .",

Actually Pellegrini's isn't the only restaurant I've ordered delivery and not checked in for some reason I felt checking in was physical lol . I love their  salads. I've had the dinner salad, Greek salad and the fruit & nut salad. Being almost vegan  I stay away from meat period. But my vegetarian ways get the best of me with Pellegrini's house made daily Ranch dressing. Omg  it's just like fresh real buttermilk southern ranch, like back in the day. The dinner salad is only $4.99 and you get peppers, onions, tomatoes, olives, banana peppers & pepperoncini's. I could eat a salad everyday here, so fresh and so good. I usually eat with my family therefore accommodate for the fact they are omnivores. My granson loves the cheese pizza with pepperoni $7.99. My bad girl reward are the garlic fries  first off the smell of fresh garlic makes my mouth water. You can see all the fresh minced garlic on the fries, but this is where I take a star off. Sooooo oil & greasy, I have literally bit into a fry and grease squirted out tmi?? Lol at the bottom of the fries is a grease puddle ahhhh lawd why ruin a good thang!!! . Any time I have asked for condiments or a special food request they have definitely accommodated me. Ordered delivery tonight for dinner. Can't wait.",

Took advantage of a coupon for a 1-topping pizza, 12 wings and a liter of soda for $20. For this deal, I wasn't really expecting much. I ordered my pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni (only $1 more for extra toppings!) and got spicy honey bbq sauce on my wings. The food took about an hour to get here. That's pretty good, considering I ordered my pizza 45 minutes before they closed! The pizza was pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but definitely worth the money. Crust wasn't burned like most places! The wings were amazing. I'm not a big fan of chicken wings, but those wings tasted like they were from heaven. They gave 2 cups of ranch, which was more than enough. The soda was cold, which was nice. Most places give you a room-temp soda, or barely cold. This place was an amazing deal for the price!",

My dad loves their burger and subs. My son gobbles down their spaghetti.  On top of them just having great food, they have super friendly service and the deliveries are always on time.  I recently made an error when placing an order on their website and I called them to explain and even though it wasn't THEIR mistake they happily sent out a new delivery with the correct items.

Pepperoni and supreme. All they had was soda and water so we walked to Chevron across the way to get something to drink while the food was being made. The wait was not long, they had TVs and a couple tables to relax while you wait. The wait was not long at all and I could not wait to taste the pizza. The pizza stayed hot until we got home and we both agreed that it was the most beautiful most amazing smelling Pizza that we have sniffed in a very long time. The pepperoni was rich and  the cheese was stringy and supreme had a very generous amount of toppings as well. It was the most yummiest pizza I've had in a long time. Definitely better than Domino's. I definitely will be back to enjoy their sales and a large variety of food.  Do I recommend this business ?   Yes the pizza looks smells and tastes amazing.",

The pizza crust is the best I've ever had, seriously, the best part of the pizza. My family loves the garlic knots and chicken fingers, especially with so many choices for sauce. The zeppolis are our favorite dessert. I'd never had them before, but they have ruined donuts for me! The staff are awesome and very friendly. I love this place.",

The only thing I'd have to comment negatively on is the price, it's a bit high for sides. Having 5 dollars for breaded mushrooms and most sides is a lot given the relatively small amounts. Still the flavor is there, so if you're just looking for a pizza go here. I personally recommend the Bianco pizza, or their coupon for two 16 oz pizzas, quite a money saver. I think the delivery cost shouldn't have been raised like it was, but I suppose that it is the summer months",

I've had better in Vegas, but it's decent.   I wouldn't eat the garlic knots. I'm from New York, and I've never had \"garlic knots\" like this before. Don't really know how to characterize them. Maybe bread bites with some sprinkled cheese on top? And the cheese wasn't even melted. They provide marinara sauce, but honestly was just a strange menu item that I believe was $5 or $6.   Overall decent food but not great. Seems more like a pickup/delivery place as there is not much seating inside.",

If your looking for the normal specials your find at pizza hut or papa johns this place doesn't have it. They do have good specials for large groups though. I ordered a small pizza for the kids 2 med and some Parmesan bread sticks. The pizza itself wasn't that bad, but there wasn't anything that stood out that would make you say wow this is some GOOD pizza.  I recommend this place if your having a group event, but on a day you just don't want to cook and your on a budget this place may not be for you!",

    "text": "Ordered delivery from here on eat24. Got the bacon cheeseburger with curly fries as well as cheesecake.  In fact, the main reason I picked this place is because they had cheesecake and it wasn't ridiculously overpriced like the last place. Anyway, got the burger cuz I figured it's pretty hard to screw something like that up (1st time I eat at a place I always go for the can't possibly screw it up option). Now I didn't have the highest expectations, but boy was I surprised. The order arrived EXACTLY when it was scheduled, the delivery guy was super nice and actually apologized for taking too long. Haha. Then I open the food up, and there is this fantastic burger, huge portion of fries, done exactly as I ordered, still hot AND had the thickest most delicious bacon piled on the sucker. I mean, I have never seen bacon that thick on a burger from a delivery place. Or any place for that matter. It was epic bacon. BACON! Now the cheesecake,  larger slice than the other places and NOT prepackaged and frozen and still in the wrapper like the bogus place I won't name here. I'm actually no expert on cheesecake,  I just started liking them recently so I have no idea if what I'm eating is the best cheesecake ever but it sure tastes like it. Thick graham crust, creamy and tasty and delicious. I was so impressed that I actually took the time to download yelps app just to write this review.  Btw yelp feel free to not make people download an app to leave a review..the mobile site will not allow it without the app and so that sucked. In fact I wanted to use the eat24 app to review but no function in that app so I had to suck it up and jump through hoops just to tell people that Pellegrinis is awesome and I loved it!",

Delivery was on time (75 minutes estimated, but hey, you can't cook a calzone and pasta in 5 minutes), so that was fine.   the Large Calzone was HUGE, and my husband enjoyed it.   However, the Chicken Piccata was horrible.   The menu said Spaghetti in a Lemon Sauce with Capers and Chicken.    What they failed to mention is that they also add sliced greek olives and Artichokes....both of which I like, but good gosh....all three of those things have a very strong flavor, and along with the too lemony sauce, it was simply not edible.   Even the chicken had a funky taste, although my dog seemed to enjoyed it and would have given a higher rating than I.    I ended up rinsing half the spaghetti, removing all the crap, remixed it and used the packet of parmesan that came with the Calzone to create something that sounds awful, but was much more edible than the way it arrived.  Even the garlic bread had a funny taste and was chewy.   I would love for them to respond and tell me if they actually taste the stuff they serve, because that dish needs some serious work.  First time trying the place, and I doubt we will try it again unless we only want a Calzone.",

With both places so close to each other, I just seemed to choose Verrazano Pizza knowing I'd enjoy it. Well, I decided to order this time from Pellegrini Pizza and give them a try. Priced at $7.99 I ordered their \"pick-up special\" which is a 16\" 1 topping pizza. When I picked up the pizza, the guy who helped me was nice and showed me the pizza to make sure the order was correct. After getting home and tried the pizza, I was pleased. There was a fair amount of cheese and pepperoni and the price was for the pizza was fair, too.  I noticed on the flyer they have different lunch specials from 10 am - 3 pm and range from $5.99 - $8.99 in price. One lunch special that I noticed was a 10\" 1 topping pizza with a soda for $5.99 which is a great deal. I'll be back to try that out at some point. They have online ordering and offer delivery.",

Originally it was ok I just paid for the highest priced side but now it's an argument every time where I have to inform the employees of the policy. It's frustrating to say the least. I order here because we enjoy this food but the employees are making it harder and harder to come back.  Not sure what's going on...  I asked to speak to a manager and the girl on the phone said there wasn't one.   Please address issues with the employees. If I'm wrong please inform me of why. Also pics on yelp show 1/2-1/2 pizzas so it's not just me requesting something out of the ordinary  11/29/2017  Still love the food...  well this was before I tasted the food tonight!  Are you making and freezing the pizza dough?  This place has been decent until now. I will not return for their food. They had great flavor and within the last month or so it's gone completely downhill. Cardboard at this point would be a more appropriate crust.",

After my last review, Arthur immediately reached out to me to apologize for my bad experience and offered me to come back in and have a pizza on the house so that he could fix the issues I had with my last visit. Arthur is super kind and his staff is incredibly polite and they treated me like royalty when I came in there! I learned that Pellegrini's does have onions on their menu but the eat 24 app did not list them so it WAS just an innocent error.  I ordered the Bianco pizza with pepperoni, onions and half sausage and I must say that this pizza was absolutely incredible!  The crust was perfectly crunchy and the entire Pizza had the look of a gourmet Pizzeria. Arthur came out and showed me that they use one of the top rated Ricotta's available and I must say that it was absolutely delicious this time around. I will definitely be a return patron from this point on and I do believe that this pizza place will now be my go-to pizza spot instead of my previous pizza spot.   It's clear to me now that my first experience at Pellegrini's was a one-off experience and is not typical of this pizza place. From the owner to the staff to the pizza itself, I was very, very impressed and would recommend this spot to all my friends and anyone looking for great pizza, a polite staff and awesome value.",

We get ads for this place at our property fairly often but with so many pizza deliveries in the area it took a while to give this one a try- large pizza with pepperoni, olive, and artichoke was fairly priced and enormous. Two pieces is definitely the max for me, one is enough for lunch.  Wings stand out more than the pizza, with a few different flavors: honey bbq and garlic parm so far are faves. Wings aren't too meaty or too scrawny but good value for the price and packed with flavor.  Not a place I'll put on speed dial or anything, but a place I'll consider when a pizza craving hits. Way too many options on this side of town for pizza to have too much loyalty to any one place.",

If you like a big sandwich stuffed with lots of meat, cheese and delicious toppings, give them a shot. I recommend the \"steak bomb\" and \"boss hogg\" Their pasta is also very good.",

The last two times we have ordered, the pizzas have been extremely salty and the sandwiches dry. We also had to wait over an hour and a half for delivery. The first time it was late, we got two excuses: One from the girl over the phone and the other from the driver, so we didn't know who to believe. They at least called that time. Tonight's delivery, not a call that it was going to be late and not even a 'sorry' from the delivery guy. Wow, we're trying someone else from here on out.",

I had the chicken piccata the first time and the boston sandwich the next time.  My family had spaghetti, baked ziti, and the pastromi sandwich.  The ingredients and super fresh and everything tastes great, huge portions leave enough for left overs.  Plus super fast delivery.  I'll be ordering from here at least once a week!!!!! Thanks to this place for doing it right. Ps I strongly recommend the chicken piccata.",

    "text": "This place is awful.  How is it even possible to have such a high rating on Yelp.....do the owners continually write their own reviews here or what?  We just ordered a Picante pizza along with some chicken fingers and fries.  Setting aside the fact that it took an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive; the pizza was warm, not hot and the chicken fingers were almost room temperature-----obviously we're not off to a great start here.  Ok, fine, let's try the food.  It was......tasteless.  Again, how is this even possible to have a tasteless pizza along with some tasteless AND dry chicken fingers?  I have no idea, but this joint seems to excel in this nigh impossible feat.  The only thing that made their food palatable was to smother it in their ranch and/or garlic Parmesan sauce.  Did all the chefs or cooks quit, get fired or go on holidays since their last review?  Were we the unwitting victims of \"take your kids to work day\"......ie a bunch of 8 year olds running amok in the kitchen?  Who knows......better yet, who cares?    This place is awful, avoid it.  I'd like to write more, but I'm busy shredding their menu flyer.",

Then I had goodfellow sub and that was mouthwatering the cheese oozed off the bread and it was a huge portion split between two people  then  we also ordered a margherita pizza the sauce was unbelievable! !!!! I've never had pizza taste this close to straight Italian pizza I thought I order it from Italy.  This place is amazing the workers are nice polite and the food was delivered before the quoted time. I won't be ordering from anyone else other than pellegrini pizza",

I am pretty sure this just became our go to pizza joint! So delicious plus we love the online ordering!",
