    "text": "***Review does not pertain to nightlife scene here, place did have people pouring in as we were leaving around 10:30***  Came here to watch the UFC fight with a group of friends. I would give them zero stars if I could, they only get 1 star because they didn't charge to watch the fights and because they had a decent SELECTION of apps and drinks for happy hour. While the selection was decent, the food was NOT!   The \"blackened chicken\" nachos had an option to add guacamole for $1, this came as 1 sliver of avocado and a tiny bed of pico de gallo. The chicken was not blackened, in fact it had no seasoning or flavor at all...was more like boiled chicken breast.   The artichoke crab dip was salty (and I'm not shy about using salt when I cook) yet lacked any real flavor and wasn't good.   The buffalo chicken flatbread was ok. Nothing special, but better than the other items.  The loaded potato soup could've used some more chunks of potato and bacon, as well as some pepper. But still was decent compared to the rest of the food.   My friend ordered the chopped salad which said it came with ranch, yet when it arrived it had balsamic on it. She mentioned it to the waitress who replied \"no it doesn't come with ranch, it doesn't really come with a specific type of dressing.\" Then my friend says \"well on the menu it says it comes with ranch.\" The waitress grabs a menu to disprove this, only to realize that the menu does in fact say ranch. I know they've only been open 2 weeks, but the servers should know what the dishes come with...and if they're not sure, they definitely should NOT argue with the customer who just read the menu a few minutes ago.   They also removed the pool tables, air hockey, and dart board that ranch house used to have. On the plus side they still have beer pong tables, new ones in fact...which is an upgrade.   Overall pretty terrible food, mediocre service, reasonably priced drinks during happy hour. If this is your idea of a good time, then check this place out! Otherwise, go eat at Tommy Bahama cafe and order the steak salad/carnitas sandwich/bourbon ribs and coconut pineapple cake/key lime pie/barbados brownie instead and grab some drinks at yard house after.",

We sat down and watch others around us seating themselves and getting service while we were getting the run around about a server will come and since we sat ourselves they had to wait for someone to free up to take our orders. It really didn't make sense to us as we sat around waiting while we saw other groups swarming tables to sit get served. Hate to play the race card but we saw tables that had white customer get help while my group of mix people didn't even get any help from any servers. Mcfaddens must not want money or thought we wouldn't tip cause we are minorities. If I could give a 0 I would.",

    "text": "I went on a Friday night with a large group of coworkers after a long week. It was one of the most horrendous nightlife experiences in the two years I've lived in Vegas. The atmosphere isn't too bad but it isn't too great either. The only major difference I saw from the former Cadillac Ranch / Ranch House is that the mechanical bull was replaced by a small dance floor.   As mentioned in previous reviews, the staff is obliterated early on in the evening which makes it challenging to get a drink in under 15 minutes (after you place your order). Prepare to repeat your order several times. The DJ stopped the music periodically to insist all bars be filled with girls (both bartenders and patrons) who would then dance on the bar while the bartenders poured free \"shots\" directly into patrons' mouths. The shots were in an unmarked bottle and were an odd purple color. Avoid the mystery bottle that just grazed the mouths of 30 other people.  Overall, I understand the idea of a party bar but this one missed the mark. The bartenders had more of a party than any of the patrons. Long story short, spend your money anywhere else nearby for better service from staff sober enough to remember your order.",

The patio area is wonderful, the service was impeccable, the servers well trained, and the food was delicious and interesting. The only down side was that the music was too loud inside to have a conversation, and as the night went on, the music kept getting louder, so that eventually you were shouting even out on the patio. I heard later that there was a dance floor, I'll have to look for that next time. Looking forward to going back with a group of friends for Happy Hour.",

We got there and was told that only one beer out of all of them, that was half for my friends or free for me and was served in a little plastic cup. Very few mixed drinks and only well was half and no food was half. I was very disappointed because I had brought them a lot of people and it wasn't what it was suppose to be. One of my friends only drinks Crown and he got one drink and they ran out - yes they ran out of Crown royal by 11 pm. on a Saturday night. Lastly it took forever to even get a drink, they need more bartenders. The music was great and the ambience was also great. That's why they got two stars.",

She walks away and another younger male comes over and again to our surprise completely ignores the two of is sitting there. Another guy walks over which I assume is security with his phone they both share in laughter while they looked at it. Yet we see another female walk behind us to a station which appears to enter customer orders. We did not so much as get a glance in our direction. The \"security\" guy went over and began joking and laughing with her. We still sat patiently while we observed the female and male bartender to continue walking by us without even an attempt to assist us. We left and found the guy that appeared to be security and asked for a managers card. He did not question us or see if he could help, he just went and grabbed the card of the marketing manager and no manager came over to assist. These so called employees should be ashamed of themselves and not work in a service industry. Being welcoming and having a smile goes a long way. If I was your owner or manager you would not work for me! Needless to say we will not bring business to this unfriendly establishment.",

My friend showed up exactly at 11 and wanted to charge him cover and not let him in because he had a t shirt on like the rest of us already inside. Captain save the day doorman said he would let him in for a $20 tip, seriously?! The drinks are hard to get due to the lack of service and when you finally do get one, it's served in a small cheap flimsy plastic cup that is full of ice and completely watered down.

We waited at least ten minutes to be acknowledged after seating ourselves because no one was at the door to greet us.  When the waiter who had passed us multiple times without acknowledging our party of 14 finally came over, we were told we had to order food soon or the kitchen would close and that if we wanted drinks we would have to go to the bar. He gave us one menu per table of 7 and when we asked for more menus he brought ONE more. Not one for each of us, but one total. There was a distinct vibe of us being an inconvenience to the server. We were split into two tables and both tables ordered food. We went to the bar for drinks and waited a fair amount of time for the bartender to finish taking to his friends at the other end while flashing us looks periodically from behind a liquor shelf. We ordered beer to keep it simple and when I got my bill and credit card back he basically just flung it on the bar and moved on to the next customer. This is when the ridiculously loud DJ music started playing for our party and the 4 other people in the place. We couldn't even hear each other speak or hear what the waiter was telling us. When the food came out, it was only for one of the two tables and the waiter explained that the other table's order never got put in, so they were basically just SOL. When the bills came he kept trying to give one to my GF who hadn't ordered anything and kept coming by every few minutes to ask if they were ready to be settled. The only other people in the place seemed to be employees or friends of the employees who were only getting slightly better service than us. It seemed like the place was being run by a bunch of kids with no experience that thought \"hey it'd be fun to work at a bar and just chill and have a super loud DJ playing for one party and 6 bar guests.\" The group consensus is that none of us are going to bother with the place again. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",

I was invited here by friends for Halloween and although I'd seen the place many times while shopping at Town Square, I really had no expectations upon entering...  Boy, was I blown away. 3 full bars, ample seating, and a deck area that wrapped around 3/4 of the building, it was awesome! Since it was a Halloween party, everyone was dressed in their 'costumes' and I use that loosely because most of the girls were half naked and most of the guys were either ninja turtles or cavemen. There was a guy dressed as a penguin and dancing with him was the highlight of my night, but I digress...  Upon entering I was given a ticket for my first drink free. Now, if you've been in Vegas for a while, most clubs say 'your first vodka drink is free', this place was not specific so I ordered an Alabama Slammer and the bartender knew exactly how to make it. Also ordered 3 Heineken's ($21), 2 patron shots ($20),  got free shots because I danced on the bar, and played beer pong (no idea how much it costs, I was beyond hammered).  Also ordered some hot wings which smelled amazing and tasted even better.  The one thing I didn't really like was how small the dance floor was. There had to be at least 300 people in the building and the dance floor was like 4X4 lol. But its a pub, not a nightclub, so I'll let that tiny thang slide.   Other than that a great place to hang out in a booth and people watch, lounge in one of the many comfortable seats on the balcony, or let your inner crazy person out and rage on top of the bar. I recommend wholeheartedly and will be visiting again. :-)",

The sandwich was a joke, two pieces of wonder bread with some Oscar Mayer store bought turkey breast and crap bacon. And I don't know why they put \"double\" club for the description on their menu, unless they think cutting your sandwich in half means double. They should call it a triple club sandwich because you're paying triple for a sandwich that looks like a second grader made. We never got our family caesar salad and when brought to the waiters attention he didn't seem to give a shit. Don't know if there's a manager or not because I never saw anyone. And on the way out the hostess didn't even acknowledge us until I said bye. This is one of the worst places I have ever seen that had such overall crap service from the hostess to the bartenders to the waiters to the cooks. If you're local and want to get treated like shit, get poor service and overpay for the worst food you'll ever get then this is the place for you. Please do Las Vegas a solid McFaddens and close this place because it is absolute garbage! Spend your money elsewhere please! And if you're craving fish and chips go to Long John Silvers, you'll get better service and get what you pay for, I can't believe I actually typed that last sentence but that's how shitty they are at McFadden's.",

    "text": "I will never go back. My friends and I went here for St. Patrick's Day because we didn't feel like dealing with the chaos of the crowd downtown, plus it's near our houses. My friends and I got a table ordered drinks and shots and I stepped outside to make a phone call with my friend because the music was really loud inside. When I opened the door to go back inside this big security guard pushed past a bunch of people swinging his arms around and yelling and cursing at me and my friend at the top of his lungs. Mind you my friend and I are petite women and this security guard tripled us in size. I seriously thought he was going to hit me as he accosted me and screamed incoherently. I was in shock and dumbfounded what was going on as he grabbed us and pushed us back outside. I asked him what he was doing and he said I had to leave and I replied why? I paid to come inside and I have a stamp and a table. He said he doesn't care and for me to get the fuck out. So I go to the front and asked the door guy why I wasn't allowed to go back in and he explained that once you leave you have to wait back in line. Mind you the line was backed all the way down the stairs and wrapped past Yard House. It would have taken like 45 minutes to get back in. I told him I just ordered a beer and it would be warm if I waited in line. He said sorry but there's nothing he can do. So I then saw another security guard letting 2 men cut in line and he opened the rope for them to get in. So I explained my situation and asked him if I could get in since I paid and I wasn't aware that I couldn't step outside the door for a minute. He said no. So I was outside calling my friends saying we needed to leave because they won't let us in. This guy I presume overheard us and said he would let us in but before he did he got right in our faces and scolded us like we were children saying we are not to leave this establishment again and if we do we will have to wait in line. This put a damper on the rest of my night. My heart was racing and felt uneasy. I have never been treated in such a manner at any establishment I've been to like this. The manager really needs to train his security guards to not be so aggressive. These guys acted like they were suffering from roid rage and wanted to punch anyone including women. Stay away from here by all means. There are many other Irish bars to go to in Vegas that treat their customers with respect. This place is a law suit waiting to happen.",

There were about only 30 people total at McFadden's. Sat down at the bar and ordered a moscow mule and a burger, cooked medium. Burger came out pretty close to a hockey puck...well done+. Zero flavor. Asked the bartender to re-make it. He took it back to the kitchen and returned with my burger with one bite out of it. Was told that the kitchen was \"slammed\" and it would be 20 minutes to re-make a medium burger. (Takes about 6 minutes to fire a medium burger.) Gabe me the option to wait or eat it. We were seeing a movie, so didn't have time to wait 20 minutes for a new burger. Ate the inside half of my hockey puck as I was left with no alternative. Staff gave zero f*cks...no apology, no adjustment to the check. There's clearly no standard here, and there's no question why the place next door was packed and this place was nearly empty. Their two-star Yelp rating seems rather generous.",

I understand that a bar sometimes gets busy and you have to wait patiently while watching a bartender walk past you several times before at least being acknowledged. But apparently she had more than enough time to rudely stick her hand out and give me a look of exasperation and annoyance while watching me get bills out to pay for my round. When I handed it to her, she snatched it out of my hand.   Later, there was a misunderstanding regarding the promo discount wristband that I was given at the entrance. She took it as an opportunity to argue with me about what I was entitled to order with it. When I confronted her to ask what her disrespectful attitude was for, she stuck out her hand and said, \"BYE THEN!\" Well...bye.  Unsurprisingly, management was already on notice about Khara's rudeness. Before I even finished explaining the situation to the manager at the front door, she rolled her eyes and asked me if it was the Asian female bartender. Bingo. The manager apologized and explained that Khara has a history of complaints from patrons. So why is she still working behind the bar?   What I forgot to mention to management was Khara's unsanitary habit of repeatedly wiping her hands off above her shirt, like she was trying to reach an itch below her top. Might want to get that irritation checked out. Either way, you should wash your hands before going back to your mediocre pouring performance.   Khara, I hope whatever is making you a miserable human being sorts itself out because you are a real buzzkill.",

Our orders were wrong and she forgot to put in a order for my parmesan garlic fries and she forgot to give me my sauce when she came back (15mins later) she brought out the fries but she brought me the wrong sauce.... After we wanted to pay we had to wait for another 15mins to get our cards and checks back. And they were wrong...  Food: so the food took forever (1hr) and when it arrived it was made wrong and it was cold not all our food was out either they came out 1 at a time. The burgers were cooked wrong and I repeat they were cold...  Management: you think management would come and apologized for the inconvenience...no...one of our friends had to go alittle bit earlier so they need to get their check, but when we asked MATT the Manager worst management ever... Seriously should be fired... Like no joke.... He had the worst attitude was completely rude to all of us and he even was walking around swearing when their was kids present..horrible.... If I was upper management I would fire this whole location and it was the WORST DINNING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE... So bad I had to write a yelp review...seriously",

The bartender seemed more irritated with us because we were getting discounted drinks rather than happy to serve us. My last drink I ordered a Sex On The Beach, watched her make it & she didn't add any alcohol to it. I basically received a cup of juice. Luckily there's multiple bars so we left that one & went to a different one where I was given a proper drink & customer service.  Playing games (beer pong & flip cup) is pretty popular & there's only 2 tables so it gets pretty crowded & rowdy when playing. Dance floor is tiny as well.",

He was not attentive at all like he was with other customers there. We clearly are new to this scenery and we felt very stupid. It would have been nice to have a friendly bartender to help us out. We ordered a drink and he asked, \"You know that's a shot right?\" in a snobby tone. When we were ready to order a new one, it was hard to get his attention. By the way, it wasn't very busy because we went pretty early. We asked to be seated at a table instead because we couldn't stand this bartender. I give two stars because our waiter was very nice and the rest of the night went well besides the bartender giving us dirty looks once we got a table.

When we finally received our food; horrible! I usually do not complain, but in this case thought I would chat with the manager just to see how this place rolls. I had to get back to work, no time to sit and eat, blew my lunch hour.   There was the problem, he almost got into my face as he blurted: \"Hey, I burned your lunch and had to re-make it.

Sorry you have to have to leave, I got a To-Go box, I'm trying\"  My guess, based upon our service and all the other reviews, they must be a money laundering  outfit or the manager has something on on the owners!

    "text": "Not surprised this place has 2 stars. 15 of us came in tonight after dinner to try to get drinks and celebrate the holidays. It's Friday before Christmas so I asked if there's discount for industry getting in through the door since we all work in bars and there's no one out tonight. The cover girl was so rude. She responded with girls get in free. I said yes well I am with 15 people and 13 of them are male as we are here for a Christmas gathering for our gym. She said I answered your question get out of my face. Mind you I work in a club, deal with drunk people all night so I understand the atmosphere and am sympathetic to others in the industry but wow she was so rude that my mouth literally dropped. She then told me to shut the door because she was cold and keep walking. Pretty sad that she's the first face you see when entering a venue. I hope management takes this serious because not only did 15 people not come in because of her, I will be sure to never send anyone there. This occurred Friday 12/23 at about midnight. I hope she gets the stick out of her ass for the holidays.",

I ordered the blackened chicken nachos and they were the biggest nachos I have ever seen for $5.50.  I ate about half before reaching a mountain of chips and congealed cheese.  Service is slow and annoying.  Food was alright.  Good location next to the movie theater in Town Square and a good option to add to the area.",

    "text": "All I have to say is... If for however long they continue to receive the amount of clients/traffic in their pub? Nothing will ever change. Service from the host to the bussers will continue to suck and suck and suck until eventually... one by one their client's are going to evaporate and all they will have left are friends who they let line jump to get in (even if you were waiting minutes before... Shady place). It is unfortunate because there are probably a couple of them who actually sincerely care for the guests (new and old).  It's the ingenious securities who think they are slick trying to charge folks 20 dollars to line jump.. it's the ignorant bartenders who gave attitude to the winners that got selected by email to get half off drinks. \"Oh, invite your friends!\" They said, Big mistake. Why start a promotion you cant pride yourself in? I mean seriously? Why would you guys think it is okay to mistreat your customers? Look at your yelps! Its so sad, it is unfortunate. Such a grand idea but filled with workers who think they are a better bunch. I once viewed this place as a place where local industries go to relax, kill some time, but (pardon my french) fergalicious that!! I am no one, but you can count me out",

On Saturday night I was sitting at the bar having a cocktail waiting and waiting and more waiting to order food ( probably 20 min) before any of the bartenders acknowledged us, she took or order went over to put it in came back and said she can't cause the kitchen closed at 11, it was 1104 when she did this and I was waiting for 20 min to order. The kicker is at the end of the night I went out to the front outside lounge and sat down in one the red chairs immediately I was bitten 3 diff times by something assuming it was a bug of some sort because I felt it bite me each time and became instantly itchy. The next day when I woke my ankles well Kankel's were swollen. By 7pm I couldn't even walk it was so painful, spent the evening in the Er with what they said I was bitten by a brown recluse gave me meds and tentnus shot. Called mcfaddens two times explained to girl what happen and to have manager call me never got a call back, called a second time left another message and still havnt heard from anyone!!! Done with this place!!!!!",

    "text": "For another bar in Town Square, this one is ok. Lots of room and three or four different bars. We sat at the outside bar since it was such a nice night. Not very crowded for 9 o'clock on a Saturday. We had hopped from Blue Martini next door and that was definitely more crowded than McFadden's. Although not a lot of people, there were lots of bartenders and hosts and hostesses. I felt like they were socializing more than serving since there weren't too many people.   Sometimes I feel uniforms in the service industry are very sexist and not fair to the lady customers. While our female server was in a plaid schoolgirl skirt so short I can see her cheek bottoms, our not-so-bad looking male barback was in a t-shirt. Can't they dress up the men every once in awhile so that us ladies can get some eye candy instead of measuring ourselves up to the waitresses...I'll get off my soapbox now.  Anywho, it was ok. Would rather hang next door or downstairs. They would have to have a great event in order for me to return.",

Not even a little cole slaw on the side just a wedge of lemon and a tiny cup of tartar sauce.  We both asked for another tartar sauce.  When the bill came I asked what the extra dollar was for and the waitress said it was for the two extra tartar sauces at 50 cents each.  Won't go again. $16.00+  each for one piece of fish and soggy fries plus the extra buck.  No thanks",

Came here for a friends celebration since they give out  wristbands and the bartenders are still rude after coming back here. Honestly, I just don't understand why nothing has changed after looking into the reviews of this place. Thought they would change some things by now.   Some of the bartenders do not know their prices when it comes to drinks. Ordered a drink called the green tea and I went to a few bartenders and they both said different prices.. which made me confused on the correct pricing. Tried giving this place a benefit of the doubt, but I'll probably stray away from this place for good until they change their music and their rude bartenders.",

    "text": "Came here on the day 98.5 had a PubCrawl for Pokemon. We were greeted by the hostess upon entry. When we told her we were a party of 8, she had informed us that the restaurant is currently full and wait is about 30 minutes. I recall her saying there are areas closed due to the manager not wanting to turn on the air conditioning.   Later a booth for 4 opened up. The same hostess had took another party to the table without asking us if we were willing to split up. No notification or anything. When she came back, we asked why another party got taken to the table. She said a table for 4 opened. One of my friends was PISSED. He was asking her why she didn't ask our party. She REPEATEDLY said \"you didn't tell me\". That almost made him go over and renovate the place himself.   After waiting 30 - 45 minutes, 2 booths opened up and had the tables given to us. The guy waiter (manager maybe?) used a dirty smelly rag to wipe the table down and a drier rag to wipe it dry, leaving the table smelling horrible.   Took about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come take our order. Food came out probably another 30-45 minutes later. Chicken tenders were small and dry. Onion rings looked horrible. The cheesy nachos had barely any toppings on top. Irish nachos was probably the most \"decent\" of the things we ordered, with crispy tater tots, topped with some white sauce and cheese.   Later 2 friends had joined us, one ordering grilled cheese ciabatta wedges with tomato soup. The wedges looked like a microwaved ciabatta cheese sandwich cut in half. And the soup was microwaved (words of my friend who ate this dish). Wedges were not grilled whatsoever.   As mentioned, when 2 friends joined us, we had asked for more water, one specifically without ice. Waitress brought a water bottle and 2 cups full of ice. When asked about the one without ice, she went to get a cup and set it at our table with what seemingly \"some anger\" and went off.   To be honest, its not the waitresses fault. We can see they are severely understaffed on an announced event day which we couldn't understand why they would be... if staffed correctly.   Overall, severely poor experience. Probably wont come again for anything besides drinks directly at the bar. Bartenders seem to be handling it well and easy.",

    "text": "If I could give this place ZERO  I would! This place is terrible. Well, I actually can't tell you how the food or service was, because our party of four couldn't get either one. Went in on a Thursday night at 8:00pm-during Thursday night football. We chose McFaddens because one of the people in our group is battling breast cancer and when she see's something on a menu she wants to eat-then that's where we go-keeping food in her is key-so she gets priority.  We were greeted by a sign inside the front door to \"seat yourself\" along with an open menu on the counter where a hostess would assumingely usually be. We walked past the sports radio people who were set up in a dark shady edge of the restaurant and past the bar, where every seat was full and there were two or three bartenders working-we assumed they worked there, as they were behind the bar, but no one had a uniform or name tag on if any kind.  We sat ourselves in a booth at the edge of the bar and that's where we sat, and waited...and waited...and waited...one of the bartenders made eye contact with at least one of us and then looked away. 16 minutes is more than enough time to wait when there was only one other booth with guests in it. People were eating there and at the bar, but we weren't even thrown a menu or a big middle finger indicating to get out, they didn't want to serve us. It's ok though, we removed ourselves and walked back past the bar where the bartenders stared at all of us as we left as if they were irritated with us that we had dirtied a booth and left-then just quickly turned back away.  Thankfully there is a fabulous restaurant downstairs from 'McFadden McSucks' that promptly seated us, took our order and didn't mind taking our approximately $250 in food/bar sales for our dinner or the over 30% tip the server received! How the hell does McFaddens stay in business? I used to enjoy it there years back. Ridiculous place-terrible customer service! You'll fail-miserably I hope and hope it costs deep into those pockets of the corporate ownership! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PATRONIZE this crap- hole restaurant/bar at Town Square!!!!",

We didn't go in expecting a cheap meal but we thought BONUS!  So we get our bill its full price we ask the bartender he says its the price for build your own burgers  only . So we ask for a,manager he says i am a manager. I said this is False advertising.  It says 5 dollar bugers not build your own. It's really crap. Plus he had to be asked repeatedly for bbq.

    "text": "ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE!! Let me explain...  Stood in at the front for 10 minutes cause of the \"dinner rush\". The restaurant barely had 7 full tables. Waitress walked pass us three times until finally saying \"I'll be right with you\".  5 minutes later a highly intoxicated lady introduced herself \"Sam\" and ask for our drink order. Drinks came out with no time issues, just the cups had wrappers still in 3 out of 4 in them. She apologized quickly, but took her time to replace them (about another 5 minutes). During that time she walked pass again with drink orders of another table.  Alright, now it's time to order all our food as we had PLENTY of time to look over the menu multiple times. She doesn't write anything down and amazingly forgets our appetizers and blames another waitress for taking them. During our barely mediocre meal, the table behind us is getting cleaned by a pair of highly trained McFadden staff, and they so how manage to throw water in the air spilling over onto my family. These ladies found it hilarious by their laughter until I told them to apologize for spilling on my mother-in-law. They made a half-assed apology and went about their day. So our meals over and now Sam tells us that she apologizes for forgetting our appetizers. Wait, didn't another waitress take them?!? So the bill finally made it over and she apologized again for such a \"busy night\".  That place wasn't even close to busy by any stretch of the word.  We went there to celebrate a 21st birthday and would've had a better experience sneaking in a flask to Chuck-e-Cheese! Save your money and go elsewhere!!!!!",

Our server was nice, hard working and apologetic, but she got our orders wrong and mixed up (that's OK everyone makes mistakes).   However, this is not why I am writing a bad review, so let me explain. I had to leave earlier than the rest of my group so I paid first, but had to wait +15 minutes to get our card back. In between waiting, I politely asked the available manager(MATT) to see if he can get our card for us since our server was busy, and he replied to us \"OKAAYY?!\" in the most RUDE ,CONDESCENDING, and SARCASTIC way. Reading from other yelp reviewers, I see that this is a common problem for other customers interacting with Matt. He does not have any customer service skills and is very unprofessional. Even if you're having a bad day, there is no reason to take it out on paying customers.",

Surely he will understand that they have a table of 14 willing to eat and no one else in the whole place...he proceeds to say that it would take him \"40 minutes\" to split our checks and it's not worth it!! I couldn't even believe it!  No matter what we said the manager said no. We left and ate at Claim Jumper where they were happy to split the checks any way we wanted (it took that server about 5 minutes to do this task!)  I guess the server and manager at McFadden's have no money invested in that restaurant...if they did, they'd never turn away a table of 14 over some split checks!!",

The happy hour menu was alright, but disappointed me because my favorite drink, AMF, was not on the menu. The crowd here is aimed towards the young crowd, but that's fine with me. The dance floor is pretty much wherever you make it and you can even play beer pong. They have an outside patio which allows for more conversation amongst people.

Right I mean staff should be on top of things and  there should be a good crowd on a Saturday.  Boy was I wrong... Place was empty (that should have been a sign to turn and run). But I sat at the bar and hoped it was just a off day.   The service sucked , sucked , sucked .  The drinks and food was over priced for happy hour. Sure they are packed on ladies night but if a \"Irish\" bar has to resort to giving away the house to survive then it's not a Irish bar.  Hell the barmaid mixed up my drink twice and then told me she didn't normally work happy hour so she had no clue what was on offer and then seemed pissed off that she wasn't working a good shift.   Trust me I know about Irish bars. I was born and raised in Ireland . I've lived in vegas since 97 so I've seen all the bars come and go, and unless the owners (not the management ) does something this pub is not going to last.    I won't be back and neither will any of my friends.    If you are going to town square , hit yard house or the English bar on the same level as this bar.   Or if you want a decent Irish pub hit up RiRa at Mandalay bay and ask for junior or fitzy.  Locals get 40% off food on Fridays.    Sorry mc f's you are more of a plastic paddys pub than a real Irish pub, fix your menu staff and pricing not to mention your atmosphere it's like walking into a cave (not a good cave either like the bat cave, more of a the hills have eyes cave).",

Not only that, even though my boyfriend went to the effort of ordering those separately before we ordered our main course just to make sure we had time to eat,  no sooner were we tucking in,  they were bringing out our main courses.  There's nothing more annoying than when a restaurant brings out your second course while you're on the first because then you're in this rush to try to eat quickly so your next meal doesn't go cold.  When the runner came out with our meals, we sent him packing quickly. And then the server came out a few minutes later also trying to force the main courses on us. No!!! We are not done with the first course give us a break!!! Finally the second I got my last bite of potato skin in my mouth, the  runner appeared again without meals and this time I was like fine just give them to us. Needless to say I enjoyed warm fish and cold french fries.   Here's where it gets worse. I am from Australia and I'm very familiar with meat pies and such. I am here to tell you that the pie my boyfriend ordered literally tasted like dirt. I took a bite and I was like, oh my god what the hell is that. So I took another bite to make sure and I am not exaggerating when I tell you that if I put my face in the dirt and opened my mouth, it would've tasted exactly the same. It was truly horrific and that bad. No lie. If you're going to go there, stick with drinks because the food is God awful and they don't give you time to enjoy each course anyway. Rather then let them know how God awful it was because we had a Groupon anyway, we just paid the bill, left a five dollar tip and got the hell out of there. Never again, sweet Jesus it was bad. Wow.",

But that's about it for McFadden's it's staff is more concerned with watching the game on television and conversing with their buddies the drinks are sloppily thrown together and unfriendly service I can easily see why it is dead in here. McFadden's could be so much more. I give it  a 2 for decor",

After the game I went to McFadden's to attend a co-workers going away party.  When I got to the door the security guard told me that I could not come in because I was wearing too much \"Red\". He then told me he had trouble in the past with people wearing red.  As an Black man I knew that he was making this rule up to keep me out of the bar.  To get in the bar I had to show him my ticket stub from the game and a business card to prove I had a job, I'm sure know one else had to do that to get in last night.  The next day I went to the bar to inform the manager of my experience and a shift manager informed me that they have had this complaint a lot lately and he believes the doors guys are racist against black men   I will never go to this bar again.  It's sad that they know their employees are racist and won't do anything about it.",

I couldn't wait to get home and brush my teeth.  The fish was obviously frozen and the chips were barely cooked, very pale. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "I came here tonight with a group of friends to all celebrate my friend's birthday party and to have a good time. Well we ended up sitting at our table for a good half hour before any of us got to order drinks (now that's just the time for the drink order).  Only two of our party got menus so most of us had to share and read off of each others.  Finally after waiting forever for our drink orders to be taken I just went to the bar to order a drink rather than sit there for another god knows how long. At the bar the bartender was in a crappy mood and even looked as though she had tears coming down her face and just did not look thrilled to take my order at all. Finally after getting my drink at the bar I returned to my seat and waited for my order to be taken. After a good half hour our food orders were finally taken by an absolute jerk of a waiter. He walked up to our table and when he found out we were all paying separately he very animatedly pounded his hand on the table, mumbled a curse word under his breath, and then began to write our orders down vigorously making it known that he was displeased with our wanting to pay with separate checks.     The only reason this place does not get 1 star is because the food was actually quite prompt in arriving. After ordering we all received our meals within 10-15 minutes and the food was quite good and very well prepared. Out of everything that night the food was actually quite tasty and worth the wait however the service is what prevents me from ever coming back.  The service at this restaurant was horrible and it was just an unpleasant serving experience.  We did come during an event day so the noise level was through the roof. In fact there were multiple people screaming at absolutely nothing and it was just not peaceful at all. It sounded more like a club at times than a restaurant.  After we finished our food and asked for our checks, every single person was overcharged for their meal except one in our party. I was charged for a Guinness that I did not order and so was everybody else in my party. Everyone was charged for some sort of drink or item.  When we complained it took them forever to rectify our checks and bring the correct balance to us.  While the food was good, again the service was terrible. I will not be back.",

First off don't bother getting the Groupon, you can't use it in conjunction with any other special of any type despite the fact they don't have anything in writing stating that.  Mainly though the food was terrible. Fish and chips with extra grease, chicken club sandwich with hardly any chicken, a $5 side of fries was a whopping 17 fries. Yes, there so few I counted them quite easily.  The service wasn't any good either. It was us and one other table and it probably took 10-15 minutes to first take our order. She never even came back to ask how things were after serving our pathetic dishes. She tried to be nice after we told her it was really bad but didn't offer to do anything about it.  Weak drinks too just for a kicker.",

Get your mind out of the gutter!!), and after hanging with the Yeeps at the new Zupas, we figured McFadden's would be a nice spot to have a drink at.   Aside from your average, run-of-the-mill adult libation offered, this place has pretty decent ambiance as well. What really stuns is the patio. It's amazing!! The night we were there, a cool, night breeze was blowing, and it felt super good while we lounged on the comfortable outdoor couch.   This spacious bar offers beer pong, pool tables and a dance floor, complete with a DJ no less. Don't know if the DJ is only on certain nights, but the mix of music was fairly decent. Kat and I did a couple dance moves while on our bar stools, so I would say it was alright LOL  The bartenders are pleasent and have average attentiveness levels. What really sold me was the Ladies Night they have every Wednesday. Apparently, this is a new thing they are trying. FREE well drinks and bottled domestics after 9pm. I will say it agian.... FRRREEEEEEE. Holy. Moly. That is either really, really great or really, really scary and dangerous for all you girls out there who like to get white girl wasted on weekdays. Be careful!!

I ordered the wings which were delicious and my boyfriend's turkey burger was delicious as well but they fell short of the following:  When the server was taking our order he would walk away as I was speaking to him to assist other people or give his badge to the manager. That was VERY RUDE. He never asked my boyfriend how he would like his burger to be cooked, the manager had to come by us later. He also didn't ask him if he wanted fries and whether or not they came separately which is a no-brainer for anyone who is in this industry with barely any customers at the restaurant at that time and maybe 2 more people sitting at the bar.  The food was delicious but because of the service we will take our business somewhere else.",

My friend & I ordered: Pickle Fries $4 Roasted Garlic Artichoke & Spinach Cream Cheese Dip $6 Spicy BBQ Wings $6 McFadden's Famous Irish Nachos $9  * Outside seating is pretty chill & nice  * Prices are reasonable  [ Cons ]   * Happy Hour portions are smaller than regular serving  * Our server checked up on us every 5mins (I'm not exaggerating), and she'd even comment apologizing for checking up on us so frequently. Although this may be better than if your server never came back to check-in, sometimes too frequently can be a con  * They charge for extra sauce & I wasn't told that til I saw the bill. It doesn't cost much, but it would be nice to get a heads up on charges that aren't mentioned on the menu.  * The table outside that we sat at was quite dingy & not properly cleaned  * There's a certain stench in the restaurant that isn't pleasant  Overall, experience was A-OK. Would I come back here during normal hours? Not sure. But, I'd definitely come back during happy hour.",

Originally my girlfriend and I were going to head to blue martini for their happy hour since it goes late but on the way there I was stopped by a lovely McFadden's happy hour sign. I realized it wasn't over til 7 so I figured why not try something new.  The menu had a vast variety of options but after reading some other reviews I decided to go with the Irish potatoes aka tater tots and chicken tenders with sweet chili Hawaiian sauce. The Irish potatoes were meh to me. I really didn't think they were anything special but the chicken tenders were surprising good. You definitely can't beat the prices either, super cheap for HH.  Overall it was much better then I expected but probably not good enough for me to return. The food was alright but nothing special and the service was so so. I guess that's what you get for a college bar trying to be a restaurant.",

Once 9:30 rolled around, this establishment turned into a nightish club. Our friend went to drop off his sister to an uber because she needed to go home. After returning, he was stopped by the hostess(the bosses girlfriennd according to staff) and asked to pay an entrance fee that started after 9pm. The hosestess manager person was very unprofessional with him and us. She was trying to throw out or friend when he was explaining that he was in here before. When i spoke to the owner, very calmly, he started screaming at me telling me I could go when i was trying to either pay or have this situation explained. He was very u reasonable, with our party of 12 plus. Do not come here if you want a good time, it is very unfortunate that we were having a good time up to this point. I saw that this place had 2.5 stars and i saw why, boycott this place because they want to do what they want. Their bar staff before this was great, we received our drinks with in a timely manner and the bartenders had great customer service. The boss and the boss' mistress were not good people.",

Food is OK but I\"m a picky eater to begin with so I don't usually eat when I come here. They do have some cheap drink specials during the week. I went in this last time to redeem a Livingsocial deal. It was around 10:00pm Sunday night when my friend & I stopped in there &  we were the only one's in the place. The two guy bartenders who were working were nice & friendly. Of course service wasn't slow.....lol I think with McFadden's being right next door to Blue Martini & above Yard House the competition is tough & business is slow there. Grant it there is different cliental at each of these places. I totally recommend McFadden's for the college students.",

The beer was surprisingly pricey (if you are competing with Blue Martini you aren't doing it right ). Even my waitress didn't seem to be very enthusiastic about eating there. And don't go closer to 9pm any night or you will be enjoying \"Irish Hip-hop Club\" music by a live \"Irish DJ on the ones and twos laddy\" (I mean seriously guys, are you going for Irish Hakkasan?)

The staff keeps getting younger and younger which I don't feel that is the warranted reasoning behind the horrible service. Although I am inclined to feel that it is the reasoning behind lack of urgency. Staff hardly ever checks on you, knowing we are drinking, wouldn't you check to see if your customers need another drink? Place has gone to shit. We just go to pts for date nights from this point out..",

    "text": "Despite some not so glowing reviews of this place the happy hour special tempted me to try it out. On first glance the glace the place looks nice. The outside signage is very catchy and they inside is beautiful and open.  Hostess:  We were greeted by a couple of dazed looking hostesses that stared at their computer for an awkward 15 seconds before acknowledging us then kind of gave us a blank stare and eventually mumbled \"uh... two?\" Then took us to a table as though she were lost.   Venue:  What I first took to be a pretty open restaurant/pub quickly seemed like a big empty place as she seated us far off from other patrons. The venue is very large. There are 2 bars inside - both of which were open which made little sense as it was not very busy. If we had been seated in a more populated area it would have made it easier for our waitress to keep an eye on us.   The place is filled with TVs similar to a sports bar but despite being an Irish pub the TVs all showed baseball and American football instead of rugby or soccer.   Wait Staff:   The waitress was very friendly and cheery. She seemed inexperienced but everyone starts somewhere and I am fine with that. The waitresses always seemed to be buzzing around but never seemed to be taking anything to tables. The place was pretty empty and service was slow so I have no idea what the waitresses were doing with all their wandering about.   The waitress uniforms would have been more at home at a Hooters. I am not opposed to attractive or sexy uniforms, the little plaid skirt was adorable but paired with a cropped/midriff top it was just too much. Some of the waitresses wore fishnets and tall boots with the skirt - it was tacky and over the top. I also was not a fan of our waitresses habit of leaning on our table, it was either a ploy to show some cleavage for a better tip or just another sign of an unprofessional waitress.   There was also a guy in casual clothes lurking around with a clip board the whole time. I have no idea what he was up to but it was distracting.  Food:  So up to this point, the service is slow but not awful - the waitress was very friendly if unprofessional - the place has a big empty, not Irish pub but the kicker for me is the food. I would take all those things in stride if the food had been good. We ordered a couple beers, Irish nachos and teriyaki wings.   The Irish nachos were okay. The portion size was huge. The whole thing was a bit bland and soggy though. If I were to order it again (which I probably won't) I would ask for the cheese on the side.  The teriyaki wings were kind of soft and soggy and the teriyaki sauce was bland and tasted more like soy sauce than anything.  TL;DR -  The food was bland, the servers were friendly but slow, the hostess seemed brain dead. The whole place seems to be having an identity crisis; it looks like an Irish pub but feels like a sports bar with Hooters waitresses. For $28 we got 4 beers, chicken wings and Irish nachos. I really went in here wanting to like this place but we won't be going back.",

Then we were seated but without the opportunity to ask booth or bar or patio. .  The menu looks very good and inexpensive and once I decided to write this review, I see so many seem to agree that McFadden's is LACKING big in the customer service department. It's very disappointing cause for me if it doesn't go smooth immediately, I know my dining experience and food I will not enjoy.   in addition, when were seated we called for the hostess twice as she walked away but were ignored. So WE WALKED OUT! Then we were on our way to a more accommodating better serving bar next door.",

The problem?  They were no where to be found.  Our server, and service, was beyond lacking.  Our drinks were never refilled, nor were we ever asked, by our server or ANY server/manager that walked passed our table for that matter.   Our appetizers and food arrived together, and worst of all, it arrived 1) cold and 2) not cooked as requested.  We ordered the Irish Nachos and a hamburger.  There was wayyy to much cheese and because it was cold, it was very much unappealing.  I ordered my burger cooked medium well.  It arrived med rare. When I pointed this out to our server, and after she stated she would remove it from our bill, she proceeded to argue with me that what I received was medium well, when it clearly was not.  We walked in around 6, and left at 7:40, 5 minutes before our movie started.  We should not have been there for this long.  But again, our server was no where to be found.  I wouldn't return here if you paid me.  How is this place still open. Can someone shed light on this?",

Their tatter tots \"Irish Nachos\" were ok. I suggest they do something else to spice them up since they are calling them \"nachos\" not much toppings on them.

I had come here a week prior for Ladies Night and the crowd was upbeat and everyone was having a blast.    Come here for the Bar at Night ONLY.  They Have beer pong and multiple bars with an outside area and is a lot of fun, BUT DO NOT COME HERE TO EAT.  One of the Worst Dining experiances I have had and I used to be a server so I recognize the bad program they have here.  They should drop the FOOD asap.  The girls here could make a lot of money if they got the drinks out faster.  I suggest they focus on that and this joint can make a killing!!!!!  I love the location and layout...",

Remind you my husband just finished a 6 month deployment in Iraq and we just wanted to welcome home back with a good time. The bouncer was trying to take advantage of him and asking him to pay him $20 just to get in because of what he  was wearing. Like really?! Who does this l?! On their website there's nothing that says what he was wearing was NOT aloud! Clearly this jerk of a bouncer was trying to make a fast buck. So we will NEVER come here again.

My sister and her son are in from Costa Rica and I was concerned that they might not like it [or more like looking for this type of food]. but after being the driver for a couple of days, it was time to give myself a treat.   The wife and I shared the fish and chips which was not quite big enough to share but it allowed us to share the bread pudding which is what we wanted to do anyways. My brother got the same thing and my sis got the Sheppard's Pie. It looked a little on the small side compared to the rest of the plates but it is heavy and so it made sense. She was really happy with the taste. My nephew got the best looking and very tasty dish; the chicken pot pie. It is huge, although it does cover the 2\" lip of the plate. Still, the crust was encrusted with Parmesan and the flavor was awesome!  We went on a Sunday and got to enjoy the 1/2 price Mojitos. The wife got a Coconut and my brother got a Watermelon-something, both were really tasty! Should have planned for a designated driver!",

    "text": "Went there for my friend's birthday. We had never been and she is always on the prowl for a fun new Irish pub. We got there and were greeted by our friendly bartender who quickly informed us of their happy hour specials. In fact he even made it a point to inform me when I ordered something that wasn't on the happy hour menu to give me a heads up and see if that's still what I wanted. Most bartenders won't do that and just gladly charge you full price. We ended up going outside since my friend is a smoker and found a table out there. They have a really nice and spacious patio with ample seating. We chose a spot on one of those long shared tables. After awhile we realized that the waitress was just going to one side of the table and not ours. It took us over 15 minutes for anyone to come by and that was only when we had to stop them. And nothing changed from the original encounter. We had to stop someone every single time we wanted to order. We took a look at the menu and my eye was immediately drawn to the pint of bacon. How could I refuse? So we ordered two for our group and it was delicious! It was a little on the sweet side so I'm guessing they baked it in brown sugar. Delicious nonetheless! The artichoke dip was solid but the chips they served it with were paper thin and not really strong enough for dipping. Even less impressive was the pouting as the gravy had the consistency of jello and the completely bland and flavorless Parmesan wings. On the weekends they have a DJ. Disappointing to not have an Irish band if you're advertising to be an Irish pub. So all in all I'm not in a hurry to go back. Better off going to Blue Martini if you are in the area. Better food, entertainment and service.",

    "text": "Stopped for lunch on our way to Frys. We were hungry and needed something casual and handy. We had many choices and too a quick glance at the menu, seemed ok. It was around 1ish and the place was empty on a Saturday afternoon. I mean, one guy at the bar and I think one table of 2. I ordered the $12.00 McFadden Ruben, my husband ordered the $14.00 burger. Neither came with a side of anything, so we bought a side of french fries to have between us. Ok, the Ruben, obviously was store bought corned beef, and burnt on the grill. It arrived on a dessert plate. It was pathetic looking. Then the burger came. it actually had no taste. I don't think I have ever had a burger that had no taste. So it was a first! Again, obviously products were purchased at a bargain rate. Im pretty sure Burger King has a better tasting burger. So the fries, well, let's see. They were fine. Nothing to write home about, but what made us laugh is they were presented with a plastic cup of watered down ranch dressing. So they get a jug of ranch dressing and in order to stretch their food dollar to the limit, they half it and add water. The stuff literally dripped off the fry. I couldn't coat a dry cat with this stuff. Fifty dollars later, we were pissed we had not looked at the reviews on yelp. Had we taken the 5 minutes we most  assuredly would never has wasted a meal here. Run.. don't go in! oh and By The Way..THIS IS NOT AN IRISH PUB.",

    "text": "This place tricks you with the idea of Irish treats.   McFadden's definitely caught me at my weakest point. After a long day of meetings, running around Vegas to finish some errands, and a quick ticket drop. I was stuck at Town Square and wanted to eat and maybe catch some of the World Series.   I stopped in to McFadden's because I wanted to try something new, and didn't want to spend a ton of money at Yardhouse, which is located directly below McFadden's. Walking up the stairs to the restaurant and seeing the place completely empty with a bustling and loud Town Square below should have been the one and only red flag I needed to leave this joint, but being the optimist I usually try to be in these situations, I passed the only twow patrons to this place and sat down.   First thing to hit me was the smell. It was like the bar had thrown up, slammed a beer, and puked again. Great way to kick my hunger into high gear. Here's the kicker, it only came in waves. Slow moving waves of funk. Red flag number two.   I ordered a drink and some food and took-in the place as I pretended to watch the baseball game. I noticed that this place is huge; three different bar areas, a very large empty dining room area, and a back & front patio for outside dining or smoking, I'm not 100% sure, but there may be been a drunk patron sleeping it off on the front balcony. When I asked if this place gets busy on the weekend, the bartender said its packed Thursday through Sunday, I find that hard to believe.   My food finally arrived and I was both shocked and disappointed that for $9 I was only getting three chicken tenders, I had to order fries separately for around $6. The fries were good , but it takes a True talent to mess up fries. The chicken tenders were kinda of burnt and one of them was still raw inside! Yikes, thank goodness I decided to look before I chomped into it.  I showed it to the bartender and he quickly took it away and brought me another single chicken finger. Yes. He brought me a single chicken finger. I thought this that was pretty weird and as I cut into this foul finger I could tell it had been totally ablitorated in the fryer and I left it on the plate.   The bartender here wa s nice, but seemed clueless at times. I would definitely avoid this place even if the line at the Yard House is ridiculously long. Unfortunately, my phone recently died and I lost all of my photos. Therefore, no raw chicken pics, but maybe that's a good thing?",

I get there and there is no food you can order, just servers walking around with samples.  Why have food on your website if you can't actually order it yet!?!?  Mismanaged!  Seems that this place is just another typical Vegas party bar with music so loud you can't even hear yourself think.  The sound system was cranked up so high the speakers were distorting or the amps were.  If I want this kind of experience I'll go to Blue Martini where the music actually sounds decent.  Get the food out, and fix the system, or turn it down because it sounds like crap!  When they actually start serving food I'll go back and then modify this review, but as for now this place is no different than any other bar in Vegas.",

    "text": "I have been to every restaurant that has tried to make it at this location, and let me just say I don't believe this \"Irish\" Bar (if you can call it that) will break the jinx.  My bad experience started the minute I walked in. I was naturally attracted to the large bar in the center of the main room. I sat down and took in the place. Quickly it became apparent that the only thing that made this place Irish was the name on the building. The happy hour menu was filled with US or Sysco food items that had nothing to do with Ireland but who cares if it's good right! So after taking in the place for about 15 solid minutes I was approached by someone I could only assume worked there because he was behind the bar. This large, but not necessarily over weight man was sporting a ball cap, a ripped blue shirt, a pair of khaki shorts and black sneakers with no socks. I had to use this in depth description because he, like the other people behind the bar were not wearing name tags. Anyway the large man quickly advised me that I was in the wrong seat because he was saving them for a few \"hot chicks\" that were coming in later. I looked around at the 8 other empty bar seats and paused to see if he was joking. But after hearing no laughter from him I tucked my tail under my legs and found a new seat. As I looked for another place to sit  I over heard the large man telling some regulars that  he had been up for three days. And that he was tired and needed a shot to wake up. But the odd thing was that even after a shot or 2 he was still tired. Weird! Once at my new seat I waited again to put in my drink order.  A few minutes later my friend arrived and we decided to order from the happy hour menu. Which by the way is not bad! There are a ton of non Irish things to choose from and the price is right!  However, you have to hail down a bar tender if you want to order because they get distracted with one another and often get into deep conversations about God knows what. And once in these compelling discussions it takes a freight train with strobe lights to get their attention. After ordering we discovered that the food was good and the beer was cold. We found it refreshing that the kitchen was on top of it and made this reviewer's score move from a 1 star to a solid 2 star.  The night went at the same pace and after visiting the dirty bathrooms we made our way home.  I hope the owners are looking at these reviews and acting on them. If that is the case below are a few things that might help your business succeed:  1. Hire a manager that can keep the staff focused on the guests.  2. Provide uniforms and make sure they are consistently worn.  3. Insist that every one who comes in contact with guests are wearing name tags.  4. Find Irish food items to place on the menu.  5. Give your staff a day off so they are not tired.  6. Never let your staff drink on the job!  P.S.  those hot chicks...never showed up! ;)",

Well  not the case here.  Again HMMMMM. I walked in and I seen the normal hats, white tees and do I need to go more into it.   The prices are the normal for Vegas.  This location was the old Cadillac location with the same crowd.  My husband and I bought many tables to avoid the drama. Since this is the first time we came here since it's changed let's see. The music was great.  The drinks were ok.  This location was packed so it was nice to get a table without buying a bottle. Since I came after 1130 I couldn't buy food so that was a lost in income and Rev.  So I can imagine if I'm hungry others are too.  I will be updating my post after I leave.",

Totally incompetent staff, everyone seemed to have a different idea of what the happy hour was, service was well below average, although the prices are ridiculously cheap. But I am not sure if this winds up being a good thing. It seems to reflect upon the quality of people and we are suppose to be in town square! My food took way too long to come out, and somehow it arrived warm at best. The food runner appeared to be overwhelmed. The bartender told me they were out of one of the beers I asked for but later in the night I saw another bartender serve one. Seemed very unorganized and lack of communication between bar staff.  Drunk bartenders and servers, with no sense of urgency to serve customers especially once the DJ starts going and it starts getting messy. This bar really brings the classy out, ( sarcasm ) come see for yourself and you'll be in for quite a scene.  My bartender had to get a manager to take care of something on my check and this became a task. Two different bartenders had served me and I got charged two totally different prices even though happy hour was suppose to be all night.   Apparently having a responsible manager readily available is not something this place values. The bartender seemed lost in his attempts to find a manager like he didn't even know where to look. Finally a small girl appeared in plain clothes and a less then professional demeanor to take care of it.   Looks like this place is well on it's way to another failed attempt at making this cursed location a profitable good bar.",

Clearly their days are numbered.  For as slow as they are the bar is well stocked and they have \"all day\" happy hour with $3.00 draft beer.",

The food, unfortunately, was mediocre at best. We enjoyed the beer pong and the bartenders were very personable and fun. I did notice they had really great specials so I plan to return for those.",

    "text": "Tried McFadden's for the 1st time last night. Ever since they moved to Town Square my co-workers & I were stoked to have another restaurant to go to for our Department lunches. After working late last night we came here & had a Great Experience. Staff was Very Friendly, especially our Waitress. food was Really Good, we tried the Hummus, the Spicy Ahi Crackers & Celtic Wings with Guinness BBQ sauce, everything was Good but the Wings were the Winner of the three. Both of my co-workers had the Fish & Chips, which they really liked. I ordered the 'Kiss Me, I'm Irish' Burger, which I first assumed was a Sandwich but turned out was a Burger, but not with just 1 but 2 patties, & it was Delicious. It was Messy, Juicy & the combination of Flavors worked very well with each other! But the Best Part of the evening was the Live Band Karaoke, which was a first for me & Loved it! The Karaoke Host had a Great Voice & she was very pretty, the band performed really well. Also a Great Plus for me, No Smoking! I realized I was in a Bar that was not smoky then remembered this is still a Restaurant first & foremost but with a Bar-like feel. They had 3 bars from where I could see and so many people enjoying themselves, And a Lot of them girls too, And on a Tuesday night!  But then again this is Vegas! I can't wait to come back, Especially on a Tuesday evening!",

    "text": "G0 KNIGHTS AND GO GREEN SOMEWHERE ELSE! Went to Mcfaddens for St. Patrick's Day and watch the Vegas Golden Knights hockey game. The place was surprisingly empty at 7pm. Sitting at the bar, our bartender came over for our drink order. We had not yet decided. Instead of saying, \"Take your time,\" he got annoyed. His demeanor was not friendly. My first impression was this was not going to be an enjoyable time. I ordered a Stella and was told they were out of Stella. I said I wasn't a big beer drinker and didn't know what I wanted instead. He said miffed, \"we have hundreds of beers.\" I asked for the one closest to Stella and he brought me a Heineken. At 8pm we wanted to order food (just as the lights dimmed in the place, DJ came on, and music blasted). It was so loud we could no longer hear the hockey game, nor each other! Our bartender was across the bar and we asked another nearby bartender to let him know we would like to order food. He told us that the kitchen was CLOSED. Wanting an explanation why we weren't told that the kitchen would be closing (we would have gone elsewhere if that was the case), our bartender came over and said the kitchen could take one more order. We ordered Irish tater tots appetizer and a reuben sandwich. I asked for another beer. Bartender mistakenly gave me a green beer, and returned with Heineken. Trying to order was taxing as the music was SO loud and it was difficult to hear him (and it definately annoyed him). He had difficultly hearing us as well and kept saying, \"What?\" instead of excuse me. So unprofessional.   While eating, all of a sudden I felt a spray of water showering me from the top of my head to my jeans. A male washer behind the bar was using a hose at the sink just below me and wasn't aware that he was spraying me when he lifted it up. I was now angry.  Our bartender was shocked himself when he realized what happened and apologized and called him an idiot. He took 25 percent off our bill. And I listened to the last 25 percent of the hockey game on the car radio not wanting to spend another minute at McFaddens.",

My daughter and I ate lunch and when the waiter said he would get the check I said I had a groupon he said \"we dont accept that anymore\" I said I just bought it today? He said then have them refund it because we dont accept it anymore. I asked to speak to a manager and he said \"I am the beverage manager\" I said well can you at least take the 2 drinks off the bill or something for the inconvenience and he said and I quote \" That's groupons problem that's why we got rid of groupon because we want people that actually want to eat here not just people that want a discount\" If he really is a manager then it's no wonder why the resteraunt was empty. As a customer I've never been talked to that way nor should any customer be talked to like that.",

First, the upsides- I was surprised at the number of mixed drinks they had considering this is not typical of an Irish bar. I tried the cherry limeade and the blueberry lemonade and both were refreshing drink choices. The McFadden's famous Irish nachos were probably the best item here. Interestingly, they are tater tots, which technically Irish nachos are normally fresh fried chips. With that said, they were very tasty with the cheese sauce and loaded with toppings. I always try to get something authentic to the cuisine, so I tried the chicken pot pie.  Unfortunately, the crust was burnt on the ends. The serving size was large, but the gravy had an odd flavor. It needs some improvement.",

We had just left Blue Martini next door, which had quite the crowd going. Going from Blue Martini to McFadden's was a definite downgrade and to put it bluntly, killed our vibe and put us into sleep mode. Even as we left around 10:30PM, McFadden's was still really slow.  My group decided to sit outside to escape the depressive state inside. The waitress promptly brought out menus and took our orders. She was actually the saving grace of this establishment. She was on top of everything during our short stay and checked on us often. I upped my review to three stars instead of two just because of her.   The Mister ordered bottled Heinekens ($6-7) and mozzarella sticks ($10). The mozzarella sticks were disappointingly lackluster and served room temperature. The side of marinara tasted off as well. For $10, it was kind of a rip off. :(  I remember years ago, McFadden was always crowded and seemed like the place to be. Now I know to avoid this place if I'm looking for a good time at Town Square. If you want to be where the action's at, stick with Blue Martini or Stoney's instead.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #263",

You will probably be annoyed at some point in the night but that will probably be because of the people there, not the staff or the establishment.

After 20 minutes of failed attempts we tried asking other bartenders and were ignored yet again. After I asked Security for a Manager to help us retrieve the ID, the common answer was \"I can't help you\".  In the end it took waving the bean bags in the air to get someone's attention.

Thoroughly mad... if i ever go back, ill be sure to use cash!!  *update* i was contacted by the buisness management, soon after the incident, where they did what they could to get my money back. They even offered me a night with complimentary entry and open bar service. Im still scared to use my debit card there as. I cant trust their bar tenders. But the managers there are good people.",

    "text": "I AM NEVER COMING BACK AND I WILL SPREAD THIS TO WHOMEVER WILL LISTEN.  Honestly. Terrible. We came for a free hour happy hour... That being said we decided we would get some food so that we weren't freeloaders. The bartender we first had was ok, took him about 12 minutes to approach us. The second bartender asked to see our wristbands to look at the time we had for the happy hour (6-7 and it was about 6:15) she then disappeared. She walked around the bar, asked other bartenders for things, threw away the beer in the bucket, Etc. when she walked around and my husband asked her what was going on(around 5-7 minutes later) she said \"I'm working on it\" used our two dirty glasses, filled them back up, walked away. I had to calm my husband down from saying anything. He went to the front and talked to one of the girls and she knew who he was talking about when he briefly described the situation demanding we cancel our order and get our card back. The manager, Matt, said that he would \"take care of us\" and seated us at the other bar. When we said we just wanted our card back-numerous times- he told us that he took care of it.  IT DOESNT END THERE  At the end my husband and I \"cashed out\" expecting a $0 balance and instead was handed the FULL bill so I asked for the manager since he said he would \"take care of us\" and that it was \"taken care of \" APPARENTLY that means that the bartender would check on us once- and that we needed to still pay the bill. Excuse me? We ASKED you for our card and to cancel the order and that we were leaving and you  Made us stay making us believe you would \"take care of it\"  I AM NEVER COMING BACK AND I WILL SPREAD THIS TO WHOMEVER WILL LISTEN. Maybe there is a reason you have such a crappy rating, was willing to give you a chance-never again.",

The bartender walked over and handed us one menu ( no hello, grunt, nothing). The place was dead. It seems every restaurant/bar that's been here has failed. Seems this will be gone soon too. The bathrooms were untidy to put it nicely.  I will say that we did get cold beer in cold glasses. The $9.00 pretzels were disappointing, greasy and only 3 of them. The cheese sauce was warmed up cheez wiz I would guess. I was not impressed at all. Maybe the \"night life\" part of this place does well but I'll never find out since I have no plans on returning.",

We sat at our table for 15+ minutes waiting for our waitress to greet all of us, meanwhile another waitress was just talking to/flirting with a guy in our group without acknowledging anyone else. When she finally came by, our waitress was nice, but wouldn't let the girls order their free drinks unless we went to the bar (which was understaffed & overcrowded) and only put in two of three drink orders. She also didn't come back for another 15/20 minutes for us to let her know about it. After that, she took another 15/20 minutes to give us back our cards once we closed out. The food was edible but not tasty, aside from fries. They had a DJ playing bad music that was wayyy too loud - we were shouting into ears of people next to us. No one on the dance floor. Overall dissatisfying experience.",

I asked if they had any amber beers and was told no and was handed a beer menu.  For being an Irish pub, I was very disappointed with the selection of beers, with most of them being domestic.  I choose a Stella and it was not very cold. It looked as though they were having issues with their beer cooler, foam everywhere being dumped into buckets.   Not sure what happened after we ordered but trying to get a bartenders attention after this point was nearly impossible. They asked everyone around us if they were good or needed something else. I actually had to wave my hand in the bartenders face to get his attention and he was standing right in front of us making a drink.   At this point I do not plan on returning here.  There are plenty of other places I can get a cold beer and much better service.",

One guy had his hand in my face. How is that ok? Nobody was even trying to stay there or fight them asking us to leave as they closed. It was completely unprovoked and so unbelievable. The bouncers acted like they had some sort of power over people and tried grouping up against their customers like some sort of gang. I'm still in shock what complete and utter assholes they were. This happened to several groups of people and had many, many people upset because who is ok with being spoken to that way? I hope the owner goes back and looks at cameras to see how their employees acted last night.  One bouncer even stepped up like he was going to fight a guy and swung on him. What the hell?

The service was great, our waitress was nice and checked up on us often. We had some questions about the food cause we hadn't eaten here before, and she was great with explaining what \"Irish nachos\" were.  I felt the food was pretty great for just bar food, the Irish Nachos are tator tots covered in your standard nacho toppings, the chips and dip are a huge serving. For the entree we got a pizza, which was a flatbread with cheese and veggie toppings.  Their music is a little weird (I could of sworn the name of the soundtrack was 'Worst Songs of the 90's' ) but I'm sure it suits the dudebro patrons that usually come into this place.

Every 5 mins you have your Deja Vu(esque) DJ calling for people to get on the bars and dance. Which is fine. But 1. some people aren't meant to be dancing on bars but might be better suited being pushed off them. 2. Kind of sucks trying to get a drink when you have to navigate people nasty feet. 3. The majority of people on the bars are \"bartenders\" (i use that term liberally) which means less people dealing with customers behind the bar. Which means waiting longer to get a stupid beer. The easiest way to get a beer would be to grow boobs and work there because every time I looked around their employees were able to drink more than I could even order. McFadden's will be another Cadillac Ranch, Ranch House, and Coconuts. I appreciate trying to create this party atmosphere but not at the expense of the customers.",

Though that was kinda gross, the main reason I decided to write my review is the food. I came here when it first opened and I really enjoyed it. I ordered the Ahi Tuna with TARO CRACKERS, which is what the menu states. I absolutely loved it, until I returned to order it again and they bring out these wacky, grocery store crackers that made the dish look and taste cheap. The menu still states taro chips, yet they bring out a poorly prepared dish, which didn't have the same taste when using regular ole crackers. It was a real disappointment to say the least. My friend's margarita pizza was different from the first time too, though not as tasteless as the ahi. It's sad to see that they're changing things that are delicious just to save a few bucks. Wouldn't be surprised if it goes down the same path as Cadillac Ranch and that other one that closed so quickly I can't quite remember the name.",

This place is in a shopping mall so my friend had a Bath and Body works bag and they weren't sure if she should be allowed in or not. Our server took our order and brought our check. A runner brought our food and drinks and she never checked on us at all. We requested napkins and were never given any. Bouncer refused to take our photo. Such a joke. I reminded him he works at McFadden's in a mall, but he said he couldn't. The DJ played early 90s music, which is our genre. Even though the crowd was considerably younger. They could've made a bigger tip off us than anyone in the place, but didn't pay us much attention. Will never return.

A manager was partying at a nearby table and was obviously drunk when he asked of we were enjoying and we explained we had no utensils. He made a screaming ass of himself but finally got us napkins. Went back 2 weeks later and left when nobody served me at all after 30 minutes. Friends talked me into going one last time.

In terms of a trendy sports bar, drinking shots, grabbing quick barfood and beers, socializing with my coworkers and friends whenever here, I have always enjoyed this venue as I get off work and have come here for some SNF and Thursday. They did seem low on staff but each time, the restaurant was not slammed when I come here so I guess the other reviews were when it's busy here. Nachos could probably use more meat as they definitely do not stiff you on the chips. The quesadillas were  big and taste great, as well as the cheese sticks and buffalo wings. It does suck too how when I was here last time they ran out of flat bread for my friend who wanted to order that. Knowing Yardhouse was downstairs, I was hoping they had a great beer selection as they are a trendy looking sports bar but they did not have many beers so they did not seem to put up half a competition against to sway others from going to Yardhouse. Hopefully management works out some of the kinks of some of the disgruntled yelpers on here so their rating goes back up and the venue doesn't end up like its predecessor Cadillac Ranch.",

They took away good menu items, closing the kitchen early, changed happy hour items without notice. Second bar is usually closed even if it's packed. Went in today for football Sunday it took about 30 mins to see a worker walking around. No one was at the door to greet us or direct us anywhere to be seated. Multiple people were annoyed at how shitty service was. I don't recommend this place anymore",

And it only came because we asked 3 times about it. I ordered a Stella, which I drink frequently, it was more of a coors light for sure. The waitress said she watched it being poured. I ordered another type of beer and didn't drink the other beer she gave me. When she took it away she said nothing about taking it off the bill. Also when the manager or acting manager came to the table she was nice but she was wearing daisy dukes..... WHAT ??  Two frozen margaritas came as she was there and it was all water not frozen.  Finally the chicken Nachos made it back to the table but after finishing all other good the correct wings never made it so we canceled those. Then we had been finished for a good 20 mins and still no check. Take this advice and go to one of the other great establishments in town square and AVOID this place and their TERRIBLE service !!",

    "text": "My first time here will be the last time. Before I explain my low rating, I feel like I have to reiterate the fact that this place is a \"Restaurant & Saloon\", not a nightclub. Anyways, here is a play by play of what occurred: showed my ID and got in line and was asked by the bouncer (who was wearing a beanie) to take my beanie off. I assumed it was just to check that there was nothing underneath it. I put it back on while in line and paid the $10 cover on a Friday night. I walked inside with my friends and soon after (about 10 minutes) I was approached by another bouncer who asked me to do the same, so I removed my beanie...I attempted to talk to the guy and ask why I couldn't wear it, since other people had hats on, but he walked away. I looked around me and after seeing multiple people wearing hats (my friend had a cap on) and a girl literally walked in front of me wearing a beanie, I decided to put it back on because it was a winter night and obviously there were other people wearing hats and beanies. Immediately after putting it back on, the \"beanie police\" approached me and I was asked to leave, with my friends joining me and no refund being given even though we were in the place for no less than 15 minutes. The only explanation they could give was that I didn't \"follow the rules\". I respect a business for having rules and I have no problem if an establishment is going to enforce a dress code, but if they're going to pick and choose who they apply it to then I would consider that discrimination. I don't see why an establishment with hardly any lighting inside would feel the need to enforce a \"no beanie\" dress code anyways...This place is lame, and I don't see any reason for going there while Yardhouse and Miller's are in the same area.",

We arrived around 6pm with a group of friends and we're hoping to enjoy their happy hour. Well no luck there due to the exceptionally slow service, which was puzzling because the place was somewhat empty.  The waitress did her best to disappear and avoid her job of serving her customers as well as bartenders ignoring you as you stood at an empty bar trying to get their attention and order a drink since the waitress had disappeared.  The food was average at best, overpriced, and took forever to arrive.  The bill got totally screwed up and I think the waitress lacked basic mathematical skills.  As for this being an \"Irish pub\" well do not believe that misnomer.  The only thing that makes this resemble an Irish pub is the name.  I highly recommend avoiding this place and go elsewhere to enjoy your evening.  Perhaps if you're younger and do not know any better, this place may be cool or whatever.  However if you're somewhat of an experienced pub, bar, or restaurant patron this place will definitely disappoint you if you're looking for an Irish pub experience.",

It is only a matter of time until this place is shut down as, in my opinion, it is not fit to do business in Town Square. There are enough of these garbage spots on the strip. I really hate that my 4 kids have to hear all of the drunken idiots screaming obscenities while I walk them to and from the movies.

Unfortunately, I don't have high hopes for this place based on the food and service, both of which were really bad. My wife has the fish and chips, and the fish was overbattered and overcooked. The fries are 'meh'. I had the Shepherd's Pie, which is served on a skillet with a covering of mashed potatoes. Wasn't very tasty, and the serving size is really small for $15. I do not recommend it. My Guinness was served in a stange (a slender cylinder for the non-beer drinking crowd). The glass was labelled \"Fosters\". I have never in my life seen Guinness served in a stange, and it was a bad look for an Irish bar. The worst thing was that the bartender didn't let the Guinness settle at all, just a straight pour to the top. Ugh. That is a sin in any bar, but it's crazy poor service for an Irish bar. Our waitress appeared to be having a bad day, and she was inattentive and unfriendly.  The only worker that was pleasant was the guy that brought the food to the table. I really cannot recommend this place. There's a Yard House downstairs from this place if you're looking for an alternative at Town Square.",

The service was so terrible I lack the words to express my disappointment. It took forever to have someone take our order, let alone bring us our drinks. We watched as the waitress asked another table if the food we had ordered was theirs. We Didn't receive an offer to refill our drinks, just plopped our food down and walked away. Next we ordered another appetizer. Once again the waiter wandered around the dining room, searching for our table. The poor guy had to go ask someone in the back, then proceeded to give our food to other guests. To top it all off, the worst of the worst. The waitress TOOK FOOD off of THE OTHER TABLE and put it in front of us. Really!? REALLY!?!?! Disgraceful, Let alone disgusting! I will never  give this place my money again.

On the first occasion I was there at beginning of Happy Hour. Despite the fact that hardly anyone was there the service was painfully slow and drink orders came back incorrect. Also sorting out the check at the end was a challenge in itself. On another occasion I was there to watch a football game in the middle of the day and had to wait over an hour before someone even offered me a menu or glass of water let alone taking my order. The only reason I got a menu was that I almost had to physically restrain a duty manager to get her attention. As aside the \"manager\" did not really present a professional image for the establishment as she looked liked she had just rolled out of bed. I found out that one of the alumni groups who had chosen McFaddens as their home base during football season have abandoned the place after only 3 weeks because their members have been treated so poorly and complained so much. I was originally looking at this place to host a client event but there is no way that I would take that risk now. I don't know if management here ever take notice of feedback because they seem content to lose customers hand over fist. At the end of the day girls in skimpy clothes do not make up for crappy service and ineffectual/non existent operational management. It is a shame because the layout and venue is so promising. I can only assume that they make a whole lot of money from drunk people on Friday and Saturday nights and don't give a crap about anybody else.",

There were approximately 4 tables sat in the entire bar. We were the fifth and they sat us behind a pole in the back of the restaurant. Apparently, it was 100 miles too far for the waitress because she took FOREVER to give us service. My husband ordered a Corona Light and I water. It took about 15-20 minutes for his beer to arrive and it was warm!  Then we ordered nachos with guacamole and beans, chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. Guess how long it took to get our food.....40 minutes!!! We were informed that no one realized there wasn't a cook in the kitchen. That's awesome management. Well, once they got that figured out, I think they put half a cook in the kitchen because our nachos had no beans or guacamole and the mozzarella sticks had leaked the cheese out the bottom. So, all we had was hollowed out bread crumb casings with a giant ball of cheese on the bottom. The food wasn't even good. It was a waste of calories. My husband dared to order another beer which took another 20 minutes. It came after the food was gone and it was also warm. It was happy hour but, who cares when you only get 2 drinks every seven days. The service was SO slow! She was nice but, slower than molasses! There were like10 employees roaming around and only 5 tables and it took us 1 1/2 hours to wait for food, drinks and service. At that pace, we could have enjoyed a nice fine dining meal. We can easily spend 1 1/2 hours in a bar but, that's when beverages aren't strapped to a turtle's back. I'm not a complainer but, save your time and money, at least in the middle of the afternoon.",

There was one bartender who was slowly making a drink for someone else. There was also this guy in a blue jacket and hat who was standing behind the bar. All he was doing was standing and talking.   He was just chatting up this woman who appeared to be having a rough day. From what I could overhear (not like it was that hard), she had been divorced multiple times and has kids. I don't know who blue shirt was, I hope he wasn't a manager but I think he was. He was more interested in either consoling or trying to get with this woman than actually serving customers. I only wanted a Black and Tan, it's not that hard to make and he could have gone back to macking on some depressed broad after serving me.    We came back after the show, the man with the blue jacket still not doing anything until nearly midnight. At that time, he forced everyone out saying they were closing. He wasn't courteous about it. He didn't announce last call. He just kind of forced everyone to up and leave.  I can't wait for this place to close. How this place stays open is beyond me.",

Wanting to give McFadden's a honest college try, we select this dining venue as our \"family dinner\" spot for the week.

Forgot her name (terrible I know), but she was fantastic even as the night progressed the restaurant filled up.  The best nachos I've had in a very long time and guess what??? REAL NACHO CHEESE! Yes, that's right folks, you heard it here.. real nacho cheese.. yum.  My only complaint is why, why, why must venues at Town Square insist on turning their restaurants in to night clubs after 10pm?  An Irish pub should remain an Irish pub in my opinion and keep the under dressed ladies and over muscled men over at Blue Martini where they belong.",

First concern was the lack of business, maybe that's because it is more of a Saloon and less of a restaurant, and maybe it picks up later.   The Menu has a lot of nice options that look promising. We shared the Fish and Chips, a plate of the Irish Nachos (Tots with cheese, bacon and sour cream) and our daughter had the kids mac and cheese.   Overall we enjoyed the food. The Fish was fried well and had a nice breeding, the tots were good but everything was under seasoned, and we had to ask a couple times to get some salt as it isn't on the tables.   Which brings us to the Service. It was dismal! Our waitress was present at the beginning but apparently was given a second table(?) and couldn't keep up as she was not present for the rest of the time there. We are still waiting for our Ranch. Not really but we gave up on it after the third request for it. Drinks were not kept full which brings us to another complaint: they charge you for each soda. What restaurant does that? I know that happens at the high end places but not any decent bar and grill in this town.   I would give the food three stars but the service was barely worth one star. The idea of a Groupon is to get new clientele, but if you don't pay attention to your potential new clients you aren't going to get return business.   We will pass this one next time around.",

We wanted to sit on their patio Bc we had our dog with us, this flustered the hostess who had to run around for 5 mins to tell us that no one could serve us outside, but we could order at the bar and take it outside, so we said this was fine. So there I stood at the bar for 10 minutes as the bartender walked passed me 5 different times without so much as an acknowledgment or a glance.  Until he then disappeared into the back for about 5 mins, while I still stood there.  At this time I heard another customer walking out saying how the food took over an hour, luckily upon hearing this I walked out and saved myself anymore wasted time at this place. Went next door to cappriottis and got a great cheesesteak in less than 5 minutes!!",

LIKES  - Huge place with a lot of places to sit - Pitcher of beer is reasonably priced - Free shots randomly through the night (Friday and Saturday I assume) - Lights on the dance floor aren't terrible at all - Lively crowd  -They have beer pong...  DISLIKES - Dj was playing top 20 type songs, if you like that then its another like for you but I wasn't into it at all - Place seemed dirty with random chicken wings or chicken bones on the ground - OVERPRICED, my biggest thing from this place was that the food was overpriced. It made me not wanna come back at all. I ordered Cajun Fries and what I got was a very depressed load of barely sprinkled on Cajun with some fries on the side. It wasn't worth the $5.00 I paid for it. Their $10 nachos sounded great but I kept on comparing it to mcmullens and it doesn't compare AT ALL. This place fails in comparison. - Service wasn't good at all. Kept no eye contact and kept the answers short with no substance  Safe to save I will probably won't go back solely because I don't want to pay for the ridiculous food prices. If they were reasonable, there might be a chance of me returning but with the not so polite service and not my type of music, you wont be seeing me anytime soon.   GOOD LUCK MY FRIEND.",

Service is very slow at every bar and there are 3. Security isn't pleasant and look as though they are all unhappy with their jobs.   The have a lot of fun games to play with your group. Later in the night the dance floor gets packed and it is a good time.   Would only recommend to come if you or a friend won the wristbands. This includes wristbands (free drinks for who won and 1/2 off for those in their group. And no cover). I don't think it would be worth paying cover and paying full price for drinks.",

    "text": "If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I can't tell you that the service was terrible because it was completely nonexistent. We were there on a Friday at 6pm, the place was maybe 1/4 full and there was plenty of wait-staff visible just standing around. There was no one near the door and we waited for a few minutes while staff stared at us from the bar area before a hostess made her appearance. It was hot outside (109+), so we asked for water as soon as we were seated. 10 minutes passed and a waitress finally showed up to our booth and said she would be right back because she forgot everything for the table (menus, silverware, etc.), so we reiterated the request for water before she left. Ten more minutes go by and she finally showed back up with menus, but no silverware or water. I order a Guinness, the water for a third time, and my entree all in one go. 15 minutes later my Guinness comes, and it was practically HALF FOAM (touted as an \"Irish\" bar and you can't get a decent pour at $8 a pint, pure sacrilege)! Ooh, and still no water!   Another 15 minutes before our food comes without the water that we've now requested three times. We request water again for the 4th time. The food was barely acceptable; oversalted and lukewarm but tasted good considering. We ate our entire meal without the staff checking on us once or bringing us our waters. We finished our meals and waited over 5 minutes before finding someone to bring us our check so we could get the hell out of there as quickly as possible.   I never plan on returning to this place. It somehow became exponentially worse than the mediocre-at-best Cadillac Ranch that preceded it in the same location.  I can't advise against this place strongly enough. The Yard House below it and Claim Jumpers inside Town Square are far better options.",

We ordered the Irish Nachos and chicken wings which were a perfect compliment to the 'Bachelorette' Fish Bowl drink that I shared with a friend. The bright pink sweetly yummy concoction did show up in a huge fish bowl. I was buzzed enough! haha.  Because we visited the establishment on a Thursday night, we immediately got a table to accommodate our large group. When we moved to outside from inside, we immediately found a table gain. Great little spot if you want to play beer pong, dance, relax and have drinks and delicious bar snacks.   I have been here on a weekend and the place does get crowded. Just plan ahead and have someone hold a spot for ya!",

Room isn't ready, so we decided to do some shopping at Town Square and grab lunch. McFadden's. Cool, let's go there. Menu is great. Had the buffalo wrap and steak fries. Nice portion sizes without being overwhelming. Delicious. We even ordered an additional plate of fries. Now, to the disappointment part.  Ordered a pint of Smithwicks. Let's just say I've had a few and know how it should present and taste. Our beers arrived flat. While trying to capture the attention of the bartender, we watched him pour a pint of Guinness. It was flat too.  When we finally were able to flag down the bartender and let him know, he checked the CO2, responded that it was fine, and asked if we'd like something else. When I mentioned my concern at the Guinness as well, he proceeded to try to tell me about how it needs to sit. Thanks. I'm quite aware of the 6 step pour process. Word to the wise, when someone orders an Irish beer and then comments on another Irish beer, there's a fair chance she's consumed more than a few and maybe even poured them as well. Don't argue with a patron. Don't be condescending. It hurts your review and your tip.",

Was there last night with a bunch of co-workers, and from the started was helped by a very unfriendly and rude bartender I believe her name is Kara (Asian girl) who claims to be the owner however found out she is just dating him.  We work for the largest employer at Town Square 1,000+ employees and growing and to be treated with such disrespect when their business is hurting is unreal.  She kept asking for our work ID's Pay Stubs, insurance cards to give us our discount, after my rep told her that she was just hurting the business by being so rude and picky she said \"I'm the owner and believe me doesn't hurt us at all makes no difference\".   People pay for service and all future planned weekly gatherings will be at Blue Martini.  You will find out how bit of a difference we make at TownSquare.  You cannot be that nasty to people and expect them to come back.  This business will be in our bulletin board for places to stay away from Town Square until they learn a thing or two about customer service.  Rather pay more and get treated better.",

I then went to call the venue to see if I could find this Christina person.  Someone answered the phone and I asked for her.  The person on the phone then gets frustrated at me since I am trying to find this mysterious Christina person.  In a very condescending voice the person says that she is no longer with them and is there something that they could help me with.  Since this Christina person was the only contact email on their website I said that you probably want to take the email address down.  Basically all I received from the person on the phone was attitude about a simple question.",

The bartenders are busy but sometimes you can be waiting forever just to order a drink. They do have some bomb food though typical bar food. Big portions so sharing your food would be a good idea.",

Now there were quite a few people in there which understandably makes things take longer.  But when people who came in 15 minutes after me have gotten refills, had their orders taken and their food already come out, it's more than just busy.  I ordered 2 sides of fries.  After 30 minutes not even a stop from the bar tender to say, \"hey we are backed up, can I refill your drink?\"  Nothing.  Shame on me I guess.  This place is not worth it.  It is no shocker that they have only 2 stars.  It doesn't even deserve that many.",

    "text": "I work at town square and I always come into McFaddens especially on tuesdays because I love their Brie apple sandwich and the bartenders know me and exactly what I drink, gin &a grapefruit...and have always been very very welcoming and nice. Good conversation and great service. Tonight I came in with a friend that has never been here before and I always talk it up because there is a wide selection of bars and I choose to come here. We came in and sat down and khara was behind the bar. Right away we could tell she either has had a bad day or hates her job. She didn't say hi just what we were and drinking and to see our ID's. pulled them out I asked her how her day was because we all have those kind of days I  bartend on the side at neche here at town square so I know how it is... She immediately had an attitude and when I told her that we worked in town square so she knows to give us a disc..and she gave me the dirtiest look like we were cheap or something and asked for proof that we work here. My friend showed her hers.. and she said ok not even thank you. I showed her an email from my bar and she told me it wasn't enough because it didn't say the name. Understandable, but I didn't understand how she could have such an attitude towards us for no reason. I said that's ok I come in all the time but I've never met you and she walked away saying I've never seen you here and I am the manager here. And I told her she had an attitude because by this time Her response was so rude and she was obviously angry flipping her hair around about to start snapping her fingers lol  I couldn't help but actually ask her why she was so angry and had an attitude. She then said what?! It's because I won't give you your discount...everyone looks at me. So embarrassing... lol I didn't need it I just didn't get how the bar could turn into such a good vibe to I will NEVER be back. I want to note that it wasn't about the disc it was about how she handled it and how she talks to paying customers. Her response to me asking her why she had an attitude, verbatim; Ok really?! That's awesome! Really it is! Cool! And turns around  She doesn't care about her restaurant I guess and it was left a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately I will never be back and I know you don't need me as a customer but know  I will tell everyone I know not to come here because of who is managing this place. I work at a travel lounge in town square.. the only one here so you probably know what company...  I will tell every traveling guest that comes in, not to go here if asked for a recommendation and I will tell them why in short.. I hope the owners take this message seriously. I'm sad about not being able to come here anymore and it's sad that that is the kind of attitude she is representing for McFaddens, which is supposed to be fun.  We come here to relax after work not be yelled at.. Thank you for reading this I know it was long!",

There were two people at the bar, the rest of the place was dark with chairs on the tables & back inside bar.  We should have turned around & walked out but instead our direction took us deeper in.  Finally we saw an employee other then the guy behind the bar who never acknowledges us.  We were told that it was open seating and to sit anywhere.  After a long 5 minutes a girl finally came by and took our drink orders.  She was back fairly quick, no surprise there with our drinks.  I asked if they had corned beef & cabbage being that St Patricks day is coming & she replied no.  I asked her what kind of an Irish place was this to not have that?  When she finally stopped laughing she just shuffled her shoulders & said sorry.  There is nothing special about this bar food place.  If not for the unlimited happy hour until they go out of business, I don't believe they would have any business.  After we were done with less then impressive bar food, we left & noticed every place around them was packed.  Like I said, we had plenty of opportunity to run but we did not. The last kicker, the place below then which is NOT an Irish place is advertising corned beef & cabbage starting the 14th.  This place I am not sure as even the waitress did not know. Its a great place for a drink & that is about it.  The kicker, I had to go to the bar to ask to pay as our waitress disappeared in the back and never came back after dropping off the bill.",

We stopped in, ordered a Ruben Sandwich, Irish Nachos (Tater tots' covered in something), and chicken tenders. The tenders and the sandwich came with fries. Everything was room temperature. I am not sure how that happens, so just bleh. The first sign was when I ordered a black & tan, a drink that is suppose to be two toned, and have bass ale on the bottom, and the black Guinness on top. I saw the bar tender set down the traditional spoon, but the beer was as dark, and indistinguishable from my son's straight Guinness. Really?  It never even started to separate. The food was $11 each, and the drinks were $7. Not bad prices, if the food was palatable. The service was unremarkable. I would not come back here again.",

    "text": "Short version: wish we had just stayed home.   Long version: the second we walked in the hostess screamed (because the music was mind numbingly loud) \"It's ladies night, here\" and shoved a plastic cup with warm champagne in it. Should have listened to my gut but we stayed.   We ordered quickly, hoping that if we got out of there quickly we'd avoid permanent damage to our ears. It's one thing to have loud music...I routinely crank my car stereo all the way up and scream along to Otep or Slipknot (I'm not a fuddy-duddy) but this is a bar and restaurant not a night club. The man and I barely spoke a word to each other the entire meal cause we couldn't scream loud enough to hear one another.   The pickle fries were nothing special, the breading fell off almost every pickle so we were basically left with cooked pickles, but the dipping sauce was pretty good. He ordered the mac and cheese burger which is what bumped the score up to 2 stars from 1.   When visiting an Irish pub there are two dishes that should always be standouts; shepherd's pie and fish and chips. I ordered the fish and chips which were supposed to be served with shoestring potatoes instead of chips, which is the reason I chose to order the fish. I got soggy undercooked frozen fries instead. The fish was not good. The batter was so greasy it turned soggy after a couple of minutes. The fish smelled fishy, which it shouldn't, but I peeled off the batter and sopped up the grease a bit and got through a few bites just for the pure fact that I was starving.   The service was atrocious. It doesn't take much to keep me a happy girl when it comes to service but when you ignore our table and when we ask someone to let you know we need something and you come to the table with a pissed off look on your face you definitely make me cranky too. It's not really that hard to fake a smile.   If you read most of my other reviews I'm more likely to write a glowing review than a bad one but sometimes experiences are so bad you can't ignore them. THE only reason this is a 2 star review is because my guy liked his burger.",

We sent the first round back and had the second one delivered by their manager. It was still warm. The food can only be described as typical bar food with nothing special about it. We left around 9:30p and we were the last customers there. At that point, the waitress started walking around the table constantly, so we got the hint and went to Yard House for more drinks.

Our Server/Bartender (Max) was attentive and cool. I am not kidding when I say they have the BEST burgers in town. It is juicy, thick, seasoned charred, bun toasted. It was just as good as first time I came. The Fish and Chips are pretty good too. I'm not sure why the bad reviews but we had a good experience and will be back for more food and beer! We also used a Groupon deal which is awesome",

    "text": "So my friends and I did a ladies night out and this was our first stop. I used to come here when they were still inside the Rio. This was my first time at the new location. It's very spacious and the three times bigger than the old one, which is awesome.  They have a bigger bar and more tables.  The tables though were only for those who reserved one though, which kinda sucked.  With as many as they had (and empty too) it would have been nice if they had allowed us to use one. There was about 5 of us and we tried, but they said we had to wait until a certain time to see if anyone showed up for them, so we just stuck to the bar. They didn't have enough bartenders and it was hard getting a drink, but once we it was good. We also tried some of their food, which was cooked well and tasted great.   By the time we got ready for our second round of drinks we noticed there was an increase in prices for the exact same drinks we previously ordered. When we asked the bartender why she couldn't really tell us. After a few minutes of one of my friends going back and forth over this the bartender gave her a discount. By that time I decided I didn't want another drink. I was a little put off by it and their attitudes weren't very friendly either. The bartenders at the old location were friendly and down to earth. The ones from last night seemed a bit stuck up and unapologetic. We never had an issue like this before, at any bar.   I can't say that I won't be back, but I really hope that our next visit is a lot better. The McFadden's atmosphere is usually epic. Last night was good, minus that one hiccup, and the music/dj was great as well.",

Excellent happy hour from 4pm to 7pm (lots to choose from) Highly recommend the nachos (easily could feed 3-5 people) There was two of us and we could barely put a dent in them. The chips are smothered in this really good creamy white cheese. I really enjoyed it. *See my photo  There are three bars to choose from (2 inside and 1 on the patio), a small dance floor and ample seating throughout the restaurant. They have a lot of Pinnacle vodkas to choose from, it's not really my thing, but they seemed to be a hit with other people   Bar staff seems hit or miss, lucky for us, the girls serving us were awesome.  But I could see some of the other girls behind the bar had a bit of attitude.   They show the UFC fights, so we wanted to see how they handle it. At first the sound wasn't great (slightly off and distorted) for the prelims, but luckily they fixed it by the main card.  So far this bar has been really busy both times I've gone. Hopefully, they can keep up this level.",

As we were walking out, I wanted to speak with the owners girlfriend at the front so I started walking that way, and the other security guard ran up and stopped me. Told me it wouldn't \"end well\"... hmmm, wouldn't end well for me? Or wouldn't end well for Dillon?

Whenver McFadden isn't having an event, you can definitely tell because it is pretty empty in there. When we were there, we decided to put our names on their list. Their list is part of their promos .. when you get chosen, you get to have open bar from 9 pm to 11 pm on a Saturday night. What about your friends? They get 50% off! I remember a few years ago, when they ran this promotion, it was a whole lot better. McFadden used to be the place to go on Saturdays. Now? Not so much.  Surprisingly, I got chosen for open bar one Saturday so my friends and I decided to go. Open bar means: you get a different colored wrist band and you get a plastic cup. Your drink can only go into that plastic cup. That cup is meant to be re-used .. that way, they can control the \"open bar\" aspect of it. Is this hygienic? I'm not so sure. I'm pretty sure that's against health code.   Anyways, open bar events are cool. Other than that, eh. It's whatever.",

I will be in contact with the General Manager seeing as the way she conducts herself she needs to find a new profession. One other employee stood by and didn't say a thing. I was not intoxicated, and started the situation off with the most friendly attitude I could. The way these employees conduct themselves is disgusting. I hope they remodel their staff. This place could be fantastic.",

The nicest encounter I had was with the bathroom attendant which says a lot about this place. They don't honor the deals that they advertise on their website so don't even bother. After ordering food nobody will come by to check or pick up the dishes once you're done. The second time we had to clean our own table by asking (which no one came) then ultimately giving the finished plates, beers, etc to the bar. RIDICULOUS! The staff is dismissive and unprofessional; selling drinks at different prices depending which bartender you get on the same night lol and I'm a local so I experience a lot of nightlife here and this place is not it. Save yourself a ruined night and go elsewhere.",

After some back and forth within my brother in law and one of the security guards 2 other male guards came over to make it a bigger issue then it was. Instead of diluting the altercation the other 2 securities proceeded to claim they were under cover cops but refused to show their badges, From my understanding it is inappropriate to impersonate a cop for personal benefit. We proceeded to ask for a manager but they refused our demands. The whole situation was one of the security guards (short bald man) was trying to physically fight my brother in law not one of the 3 male guards proceeded to kick us out or actually \"arrest us\" like they  claimed. At the end me and my sisters got my brother in law away from that 3-1 situation and went home. I did mention to the men that I would proceed to report this issue to the proper departments.",

There's people inside and outside. Their food like their burgers and chicken wings look and taste good. They utilize the entire establishment, the various bars and dining areas, beer pong. There's a DJ or two and girls on top the bar counters. Service is excellent, fast, and their happy to serve you. The environment is so good that when your party wants to leave you stay after saying goodbye to them.   Of course this has to be only when there's an event or something because I've also been here when a lot of what seemed good above weren't. The burgers seemed smaller and a mess, wings were kind of tiny and overcooked. They would take forever to bring food and drinks. Some of employees seemed like they didn't want to be there or if we asked them for something we were bothering them. Occasionally it would be so dead that you want to leave before happy hour is over. The inconsistency just kills me I'll write this place off then I'll have a really good experience, come back then get another bad experience. I'll be back,  have been, so hopefully next time it'll be a good one.",

Got the 3 Cheese to Go with included cup of tomato soup,  both menus are extensive for 2 people so we ordered what we wouldn't find else where.  Ryan greeted us at our table and took our order. Shock Top on draft and bottled water was refreshing. We got the McFadden Irish Nachos, if u like tots, cheese and bacon, these were Awesome.  Chicken Wings were Excellent, nice crispy charred flavor using sauce for additional flavor.  Wife got the Fish and Chips, sub Mac n Cheese for Fries for buck more, nice portion of Mac n Cheese. Fish was wild caught Alaskan Cod, filet had delicious oily flavor, cod is also known as Butterfish, batter was flavorful and melded with Cod flavor. I got Reuben Burger, Winners, Corned Beef strips were well seasoned, could've been a sandwich by itself. Burger must've been 1/3 of a Pound at 3/4\" thick, got Burger medium done, nice Charred flavor and burger tasted like a good ground steak.   All in All food ordered was Great and Tasty.   Customer Service by Ryan and Crew were top notch, very attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about what the menus offered and how to order the food items.  Thank You Very Much McFaddens.   See You Again   PS....  McFaddens has Raiders Logos up already",

Terribly rude service, stacked upon messed up orders by the bartender (I think his name was Ryan), and topped off with him WRITING IN HIS OWN TIP after I had signed and left! When I called to dispute the transaction with a manager, I was pushed off by the lady answering the phone, and never had my calls returned by a manager. Despicable company all around.

Last night, me and my family heading to McFaddens, after being VIP at Stoney's where we had absolutely no issues getting in. As we approached the line the get in, one security guard in particular was EXTREMELY rude and offensive.  Because we are covered in tattoos and wearing certain colors they told us we were gang related. Every person in our group is a successful business owner, some owning more than one business. The men with us were dressed very nice, clean cut and classy.  We have everything in our group from professional models who have made it onto mainstream tv, musicians and small business owners and entrepreneurs.   Kudos to Stoney's for treating us the way we expect to be treated when we are coming in and giving respect to our surroundings and  spending so much money.   McFadden's will NEVER get my business and if I hear of anyone wanting to pay a visit, I will tell them of the horrible experience with discrimination that we had. I'm sure the rest of our group will do the same, and that's sad considering most of us are in the lime light in some way or another.",

Anyways, I decided on that while my girlfriend got the chicken pot pie and we got onion rings to start. The onion rings were nice and crisp and when the food came out we were surprised at how big the portions were. Especially her pot pie. It was HUGE!  Overall this was a great experience. The serve/bar staff was very friendly and like I said the food was great. Good drink selection too, I don't know many places with modelo on tap :)",

First off, it's very refreshing to be able to walk into a bar and not see slot machines decked out around the bar, especially when you're so close to the strip. This may be a Town Square thing (which is an awesome place to be anyway) but the comment still stands for those people like me who have a hard time not putting a couple $20s in when they're right in your face the entire time.  The staff is amazing and are incredibly hard workers at all times, whether it's during some of their slower times or during their peak hours Thursday/Friday/and Saturday night. These three nights seem continuously busy with full DJ set up and a real party vibe with great drinking deals throughout the night.   If the party type of setting isn't your thing, their day time food/bar is actually quite relaxed with a very friendly regular customer base, most that work around the mall. Great music during the day time and they show televised sports (audio on during the bigger games). Food is great and their micheladas are the best!",

If you're wondering how a bar can be so appealing, like I did, think of it as Commonwealth-like with cheap drinks in a more centrally located area.   Decided to check it out on a Friday night because my friend won open bar for herself & half off drinks for her friends. The drinks... Blechhh. The bartenders must have heavy hands, the drinks were way too strong to consume. I asked for a Vodka Lemonade and had to toss it in the trash midway.   There's plenty of space- a patio in the back, loads of booths and tables, dance floor, an area for BP, and 3 bars scattered around. Despite all the space, this place was still packed! It's hard to get around.  And ladies, don't think you can rush to the bathroom when you had too much to drank. There's always a line of ~5 girls, so plan your bathroom trips accordingly.   One thing I did love was the music selection! They played everything, old and new. Weird that they place that Blue da ba di da ba die song, but it was pretty cool when they played The Outfield's \"Your Love\" and everyone busted out singing, \"and I don't wanna lose your love toniiiiight.\" Who knew college kids could jam to the old school stuff too.",

Drinks? Ordinary.  Service? Unrefined.   If I'm looking for an adult beverage in Town Square, I'm likely to go elsewhere. If I'm looking for an Irish bar, I'm definitely going elsewhere.",

Many friends come here to drink and hang out; we also hang to crowd the overused bathrooms!   Bartenders can be forceful and crabby, but they can remember your drink at least. Sometimes they direct you to waitresses, who are hard to find!!! I only saw one the entire night.   They let guests dance on the bar to the weirdest songs. The crowd is odd; mostly young people, but some old ones, too!   Don't forget the crazy overpriced food!! If you couldn't win prizes fun prizes here, everyone would just pass this place by!   It's that bar where you reminisce about the college parties you used to have, since mostly college kids spend their days here!",

    "text": "This place is a complete JOKE. Came with my boyfriend, who has gone to the bar over the weekend MANY times. We got in line, and the security guard tells my boyfriend that since he was wearing joggers, he couldn't go in. Online it says \"no sweat pants, or gym attire.\" Last time we checked, olive green canvas material joggers were neither of those things. My boyfriend might I add is a type 1 diabetic, who wears an insulin pump on one side of his butt, and a sensor on the other side to monitor his sugar. This makes it very hard for him to wear skinny jeans or pants, since it is taped onto his skin to stay in, and is about 2 inches thick. He explained this to the guard that he couldn't wear anything fitted because he has a medical reason. His words were, \"I don't care if you've come in before on the weekend dressed the same way, you're not going in.\" So he argued that he did not care at all if he had a medical reason, and that it was just too bad. My boyfriend asked for the man's name, and the other security guard charged at him yelling in his face that they don't care what kind of medical reason he has, that he needed to go else where. He then asked for my boyfriend to show him PAPER WORK of having diabetes, even though he was holding his insulin pump in his hand. After him being screamed at by the fat, bald guard we had to leave. It's also humorous that they have a dress code, yet other people were wearing sandals, and plain white tee shirts that are clearly NOT permitted according to their online dress code, but green joggers that weren't even sweat pant material are not allowed. None of our friends will ever return, and we for sure will not either! The guards are complete jerks, and should be ashamed of themselves. But hey, I'm sure they feel super cool being guards at some crappy bar in Town Square.  I also tried calling to speak to a GM, and the person I spoke to told me that they don't deal with anything with security, it's a security problem only, and they can basically tell whoever they want that they can't go in. This restaurant/bar is horribly run, and their customer service is a disgrace.",

    "text": "First time trying this place.  I really wanted to like it because I love English/Irish food.  Walk in the door and seated ourselves (as the sign suggested).  Sat in the booth and waited about 4-5 minutes without being greeted.  Then another guy and his son sat in the booth behind us.  Another few minutes goes by and the guy in the booth behind us gets drinks and orders before we have anyone come over.  While we were waiting we noticed a good coating of dust along the booth wall railings, so my wife wrote her name in it.. ugh..  We were about to leave, when the waitress finally arrived.  You could tell she doesn't like her job.  Ordered fish and chips for myself and the wife had a Ruben.  The place was pretty much empty except for the bar, so the food came out reasonably fast.  My fish and chips, which cost $15 were three smaller pieces of cod in a basket.  When I pulled one out, it flopped over like a limp noodle.  The outside was coated in grease and the breading was slimy instead of crispy.  They looked burned (either that or the oil is really dirty).  I couldn't believe any self respecting chef or food cook would send that out of the kitchen to be eaten.  I sent it back (the first time this year I've had to send food back).  I felt terrible about wasting good fish, but it wasn't edible.  I ate half of the wife's' Ruben (which was way more kraut/sauce/bread than beef).  No doubt we'll not be back again, there are much better restaurants to chose from and this place isn't exactly cheap.",

When we walked in the door they would not honor the drink tickets that were part of the purchase of your ticket for the evening (one drink at each stop). They said that the manager who had approved the event had been demoted to a cook so they wanted to charge five dollars per person to Project Teddy for the 110 people that were in the group. Needless to say we all got up and walked out immediately. This event is for children suffering with cancer and McFadden's management wanted to make money on it over and above the money they were going to make from the food and beverage orders that people would have placed had we stayed there. I will never go to there again.",

Our waitress seemed to be busy keeping her regulars happy while ignoring other tables. All the TVs had wrestling on at a ridiculous volume, my husband and I had to yell across the table like we were in a club or something. There was barely anyone in there so it's not like there was noise the TV had to compete with. Also, wrestling? Really? Another reason I feel they cater to the regulars paying their bills. All the 30 going on 12 year olds at the bar seemed to be real into it while the rest of us seemed to be looking around to see if this was really happening. We won't be back.",

It just sucked that they were so packed. It was difficult to order drinks on multiple occasions because there's always so many people at the bars. It's also impossible to walk around because it's so crowded! The dance floor is also hard to move around! The music wasn't always so great though. It was always a mix of 80s-90s hip hop with a couple current hits mixed in. Very strange to dance to but it was still fun. I miss the old days before this place got so popular but I guess that's good for them.",

I figured at most an extra $1.50. When the bill came it was rung up as a regular Bloody Mary... Not as a well happy hour drink with an up charge for essentially tomato juice. I talked to the manager, who obviously did not care a bit about customer service because he just said, there must have been a miscommunication. He said I had to pay the $8.00 per Bloody Mary ( which is the regular price for a Bloody Mary). I will never go back.

First thing we walk in the door and there's two hostesses, one of which was wearing the half shirt and had a huge gut spilling out. Since I saw a bunch of girls in full length tanks I know that was not a REQUIRED uniform. I won't hold that against them and not part of my 1 star rating, but still not a good first impression. So they proceed to sit there and both stare at me while ONE is on the phone taking a reservation for five people. My one year old starts getting antsy and trying to jump out of my arms and they still don't seat us... Uhh hello anyone home? So then we get seated. We told them three adults, one child. They give us two adult menus. So the server comes. Extremely ditsy but nice. I tell her what happened with the menus, she says she will bring another. She comes back 4 more times to ask us if we're ready which were not because we're all huddled over and switching menus back and forth. So we start with the Irish nachos. Tater tots with bacon, sour cream and cheese. Uh yeah right.  A pile of tater tots, with a sprinkle of cheese sauce, a half a slice of bacon crumbled on top, and a tiny drizzle of sour cream. If it wasn't happy hour we would've sent them back. So we each order a beer. Myself a Guinness, the other two a bass and a blue moon. As soon as the bass is sat down he takes a sip and says try this is tastes almost like a miller light. I tasted. It tasted like half bass, half miller light. Weird. I tasted my Guinness. I couldn't take more than two sips, and we all concurred, tasted like Guinness water. The blue moon wasn't as watery, but also had a weird miller light taste to it. Again, happy hour, so we just dealt with it.  The server kept coming to our table throughout and would blankly stare at us and say things like \"ohhhh myyy goooooooddddddd my necklace broke!!!\" It was so awkward. Almost like she was on drugs. No one in that place seemed to know like they knew what was going on at all.  I will say my burger was pretty good, though my hubby's was RAW in the middle. He ordered medium well. You could touch te middle and feel that it wasn't cooked. We had such high hopes for this place but I can promise we will NEVER be back. Gross. This place won't last long in Town Square. No quality or customer service. Hurry up McFadden's and move along so something better can open up in your place.",

Not only that I have left 3 messages for them to call me back and no one has returned my phone call. And today is March 19th my birthday was yesterday and I'm ready to come in there with 20 people and have a great time but no one has called me back. We are locals that live down the street and attend McFadden's regular me it's awesome that I want open bar but it's really not cool that they can't return my phone call or give me any information on it",

Alright, not unheard of, whatever. So we left most of our party at a table on the patio and a friend and I went to the bar - we waited 15 minutes and rotated between 3 bartender spots (seemed like each one had their own register) and finally after 20 minutes of waiting and not even being recognized by the bartenders we decided to leave and head downstairs to the Yard House, where we were waited on right away.  They weren't even busy, just terrible servers.   Sorry, but any place that couldn't even make eye contact and say \"I'll be right with you!\" isn't worth my money. Forget this place, head somewhere that appreciates good customer service.",

Why can't Vegas stick to a theme? Why do we have to make everything trashy?   I've been here on an early Friday and late Saturday. If you come here before 10PM, you can actually hear people and have a conversation. It's not too bad, but still doesn't feel like what a cozy Irish pub should feel like. After 10, the shit show begins. Obnoxious mainstream pop/hip hop music start to blare, ass grinding begins, beer pong happens and fights occur.   If you want to have a conversation with your friends, forget about it. This place was meant to feel your friends, not hear them. I ended up shouting all night. I was trying to get a little buzz going to like the place more, but their drinks are watered down.  On the bright side, their burgers are magical for the price and their hummus is on point. That's why I give this place 2 stars. One for the hummus and the other for the burgers.",

    "text": "Ah the new kids in town.  McFadden's just recently opened and though that's apparent to a trained eye, to the average person this place looks like it's been around for awhile.  I decided to meet my CrossFit amigos for an impromptu Sunday Funday around 5:30PM.  Upon arrival, I was introduced to T, our bartender for the night.  I was then also informed that it was happy hour! Hooray! Half-priced EVERYTHING until 7PM.  Literally, everything. Now that's exciting, yes but kind of dangerous! I'm still feeling the effects of half-priced tequila 24 hours later.   The menu is very 'bar food' ish (and all looked delicious) but I was stoked to see a healthy option hidden between burgers and fried cheese - Build your own salad! And they had great options for veggies, protein and fats - everything this Paleo gal needs to create a bomb ass salad. They even let you fill out a sheet, kind of like at 'The Counter' so there was no mistaking exactly what I had ordered.  I even wrote 'dressing on side' and whataya know! They actually put it on the side!!  It wasn't very busy but in time I'm sure more people will start piling in. It's so much better than Miller's, I think Yard House would be the only real competition. Hope this place makes it!",

We went last night for St. Pattys day so I expected it to be a little bit busier, but as I stood at the back patio bar watching the bartender skip me I don't know how many times I was already ready to leave. I ask for two green beers which are on special for $4 each and he didn't even put food coloring in one, I had to reach and do it myself. $8 and took 30 minutes. Then my friends come up to order 2 green beers each  5 minutes after me and get charged $15. They try to ask the bartender if he made a mistake as two green beers should have only been $8 , but he wasn't hearing it. He swiped my friends card and then threw it them. What kind of service is that ?! We go to the main bar asking for a manager and one of the girls says she'll get one, but no one ever came. No one was apologetic and that bartender in the back was way out of line. I get you're stressed because it's busy, but you dont overcharge people and have an attitude when they try to clarify or ask you a simple question.",

    "text": "I was in town for work and decided to hit up Mcfaddens after getting out of a movie for some food.  I'm not even sure I can accurately describe the dining experience.    1st round of drinks takes about 15 mintues and some of the drinks were not make correctly but we keep them because it took so long.  We ordered a bunch of the happy hour appetizers, then decided we wanted some burgers but could not figure out who our actual waitress was and nobody was willing to take our order.    Apps come and they're typical bar fried food, but then we realize we have no plates or silverware.  We flag down a bus boy who then brings us 4 sets for 5 people.  ???  Get another set, then finally figure out who is waiting on us and order burgers.    2nd round of drinks takes over 25 minutes to be delivered.  Burgers actually come out in about 10-15 minutes.  Bus boys continue to deliver food to our table that we didn't order.  At one point on the 3rd extra delivery he just looks at us and says.. just keep it.  I can see the table next to us giving our server an earfull.  3rd round of drinks came out faster.  Burgers were actually pretty good.  Good luck getting refills on your waters or iced tea.  Before our waitress has a meltdown we ask for the check.  We were pretty nice, not d1cks like the table behind us.  When our waitress came back she said she gave us a 50% discount because everything was so messed up.  Then she comes back and says she gave us the wrong check, and hands us one for 20$.  Our original bill for our group was over 100$.  Nice move and thank you.  The next day I found out they had only opened the previous night.. still no excuse someone should get canned for this circus side show.",

    "text": "The saddest part about this one star review is that McFaddens has all the elements to be GREAT and they are blowing it by having TERRIBLE service and drowning good food in SALT.    I went there for a company happy hour.  There about 25 people in our party, arriving in waves.  the first 6 or so people got their drinks, the rest of us it took about 40 minutes to get a drink.  When we complained, they said there was only one bartender.  Guess it takes 40 minutes to pour 2 pitchers of beer and 3 mix drinks.    the place was not that busy, so there really was no excuse.  Since the service was so bad, I decided to try the food TO GO, since the menu looked promising.    We ordered 2 of the $5 burgers with various toppings.  the waitress asked me 3 times about what kind of mayo we wanted and confirmed twice on the plain mayo.  the burgers came with NO MAYO.  they had 2 patties which I wasn't expecting, don't know if thats normal, but its too much.  the worst part.....my medium temp patty was RAW,  not just rare,  raw and cold in the middle.  When I got home I had to remove it from the bun and cook it in the microwave.   Once it was cooked it tasted good, but I shouldn't have to cook my burger at home.  I ordered a chopped salad and got a chicken cobb salad at home.  on the side of the burger was a fried pickle.  First bite was good,  second bite was like biting into a teaspoon of SALT.  I had to spit it out.   I ordered side of mac n' cheese.  for $6 bucks I was expecting something that did not look like kraft mac n' cheese.  but the kicker was it NOT COOKED.  It was like the chewy pasta that sticks in your teeth.   Again, I added a little water to it and put in the microwave to finish cooking.   At first I thought it was edible now.  then I realized it tasted like they had half cooked the pasta then soaked it in a box of salt then poured some cheese sauce on it.  NOT EDIBLE again.   the good news is with the happy hour prices, 2 burgers, fries, mac n cheese and a salad was only $17.  If the food had been edible I could see us eating here every other week.  FIRE the COOK who has stock in mortons salt company and is drowning fresh food in pounds of salt and failing to cook things properly.   Seriously,  get the right cook and decent service and we might be back.  Otherwise never again.   It almost felt like the cook was trying to purposely ambush the restaurant.  Such a shame, great location, great ambiance, good prices, good ingredients, BAD EXECUTION.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to Las Vegas we were going to attend a special midnight showing at the AMC Town Square Theater.  After a long day at a local convention, we decided to head to the theater early and chose a place to eat that was near the venue.  Once we arrived the decision was made to eat at McFadden's Irish Pub, since several members of our group of 8 loved it when it was located at the Rio.  Since there is no better endorsement than from close friends, we decided to give it a try. We arrived around 9:00 and sat at a high-top table near the bar and dance floor.  The eight of us crowded around the table, took our seats, and were greeted shortly by Tanya, our server.  She took our drink orders and brought them back shortly and took our food orders.  By 9:15 she had taken our dinner orders.  It is worth noting that this group of eight hadn't eaten since lunch. 20 minutes later we started wondering about our food.  No one ordered anything special or difficult.  It's a pub, so the food isn't terribly complicated.  There were a few burgers, nachos, and chicken wings.  Nothing fancy. 30 minutes later we continued to wonder about our food when we noticed that other tables around us who had food orders hadn't received their orders, either.  By this time it's 9:45 and not only are we very hungry, but we're starting to get unpleasant (this group of eight hasn't eaten since lunch).  Tanya came around and offered a round of drinks on the house (thank you!), but the fact that food still wasn't on the table is the actual issue at hand.  By this time several of us were getting low blood sugar and getting what my wife refers to as \"food headaches\".  Irritability starts to set in. At 10:00 two things happened to make this dining experience worse.  1)  The lights were dimmed to the point that you could barely see what was in front of you and 2) the music was turned up.  WAY up.  Like, to 11.  At this point talking to the person next to you was an exercise in futility. At about 10:10 food started coming out...for other tables.  While there seemed to be a moratorium on food for the better part of an hour, there were signs of sustenance ahead.  Meals were delivered, two or three plates at a time, to the table next to us and to a table that was seated after us, and one or two to our table, seemingly as a side note.  By the time the last meal was delivered to our table it was 10:25, meaning that the meals that were delivered previously had cooled down, but nothing was said because A) We didn't want to wait another hour for any problems to get fixed and B) We had a deadline we had to meet. There were no problems with any of the meals (aside from the cooling down of those delivered 15 minutes before the last one was), and everything tasted fine, despite not being able to see what we were eating.  We ate hurriedly, being unable to really enjoy our meals because of the completely unacceptable service time.  No sooner did my wife eat her last bite when she had to walk out of the establishment due to the volume of the music. We don't know what happened.  Did the cook just come in to work?  Did the kitchen staff take an abnormally long break?  Were they waiting on their supplier to deliver the food?   We were never given an explanation as to why the food was so delayed. Would I recommend this eatery to anyone?  Based on this visit, ABSOLUTELY NOT.  While Tanya was pleasant and did what she could, the real problem was out of her hands and lies squarely with the kitchen and the (lack of) management.   There are reasonable expectations that food delivery is going to be timely.  This Was Not The Case. There are reasonable expectations that the atmosphere will be conducive to enjoying your meal.  Exceedingly loud music and very low light made that rather impossible. As much as I'd like to give this establishment a great review, I simply can't.  Accurate orders and an attentive server don't make up for lousy service times and an atmosphere that's seemingly designed to keep diners away...or to drive them away to make room for the bar patrons.",

The waiter and another guy (manager?) came to the table several times, so they couldn't have missed it.  Never took it away, commented or apologized.  I imagine we were charged the full price.  The servers were very nice and attentive, but then we were the only diners and there were only 5-6 people at the bar.  I know this is a fun place at night, but skip this place for food unless you have a Groupon.",

The floor was sticky, gross and smelly. There was spilled drinks and glasses and food tray on the floor.  I was so disgusted to even eat or drink. I did not have a good time here no matter how hard I tried. The music was alright. From house to old school hip hop/ rnb. The crowd was anywhere from preppy, hipster, slutty to hip hop and Jersey Shore-ish. Really.  We walked around, danced a bit and found a spot to chill. I wasted 2 hours of my life here. If it wasn't for friends, I wouldn't be here. Weird and awkward vibe. Ugh!",

They're pretty fast on to go orders and their Appletini's are pretty good.   If you get their chicken pot pie be sure to bring your kids, your neighbor's kids and your softball team. This thing is huge and I looked at it with awe when the bartender hefted it in front of me. I took the leftovers to work and fed 2 other people.  Besides an over abundance of peas it was quite pleasant. I'm just not a person that likes a lot of peas. The flaky puff pastry crust was pretty awesome.   I once order the fish and chips and received an entire fish. I feel like the cook is trying to compensate for something, just kidding.",

My friend and I had gone to McFadden's as Yard House was swamped, and we were looking for something similar.  The inside is a dive. There's no authentic Irish pub feel here.    We were unfortunately seated in the bar area which was insanely loud. There was Guinness on tap, but the rest was domestic. If it's an \"Irish pub,\" I would expect to see a few more things on tap from Ireland...just saying. I ended up ordering a Sam Adams seasonal.  We ordered two orders of the poutine on the happy hour menu. About 20 minutes, the food arrived. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worse. I would describe it as a cross between McDonalds fries with some cheese on top of them. Branding as an Irish pub should generally come with good pub-style food.   Overall, I would never go back to McFadden's. I would keep walking and go get a sub at Caprottis.",

When it first opened this place was so much fun and actually was a destination for me and friends to say hey let's go there to have fun! The past two years every so often we would try to give this place a chance again, but it seems every time they have the worst service where you don't even get acknowledged to order a drink or when they finally do acknowledge you, it's been over 10 minutes just to order one drink. Last night has to be the cherry on top for one of the worst experiences here. Prior times we have walked out because we have waited over 15 minutes to get a drink. Last night I wasn't even drinking alcoholic beverages, but it took over 10 minutes just to get a bottle of water. The music is so loud the bartender thought I said i wanted just regular tap water I guess so I had to get her attention once again to get a bottled water like I initially asked for. This place is loud like a night club where even while screaming to a friend across the booth they cannot make out what I am saying. The place was absolutely burning up and when we went outside to get \"fresh air\" it reeks of cigarette smoke on the outdoor patio and somehow was hotter than the actual air temperature outside. After about 40 minutes we decided to head on over to blue martini where the A/C actually works and you can actually sit and have conversations with your friends. I highly do not reccomend this facility. They also have a strict dress code for some reason, especially for men. It's not a classy bar, more like a dive bar; and the drinks are pricey even for the well drinks. Good luck to any future consumers that go there!",

The side of young carrots (bigger than \"baby\" but not full sized) was raw but warmed. Cooked carrots should not crunch. Daily Specials aren't served until after 3 PM, not at lunchtime, which is insane. The only Irish food on the menu was the steak and mushroom pie, possibly the chicken pot pie too. No Irish stew?!? You're kidding! The beer selection is almost exclusively American, they had Guinness stout but NOT Harp Ale, WTF? The decor was straight out of a Simpsons or Family Guy parody of what Americans think an Irish pub looks like. The menu typeface is WAY too small to read in the dim light. Seriously, no one over 30 in our group could read it, and even they needed their cellphones as flashlights.  PROS: The staff was efficient, friendly, and good with a large table of guests.  If you want a California franchise that vaguely suggests Irish stereotypes and doesn't serve Irish food or drinks, you may like McFadden's. But if that's all you want you can get it at a lower price many other places.",

If you are Irish, or have had authentic Irish food, you know the Irish traditions steep deep into culture and flavor profiles. This place must obviously be an American owned and hopeful enough to call themselves Irish. Because this food is simply bland, boring, bland, boring, bland, and freaking boring. DO NOT EAT HERE!   I paid $16 for corned beef and cabbage with potatoes. Each of these items were on my plate, no seasoning, no flavor, meat was dry, and it had no flavor, or any redeemable quality about it. I just tossed money down the drain. Even I can cook a memorable plate of Irish food   In a crockpot.

Not a big fan of champagne  but still a nice gesture. We were there around 10 so it was still early in the night so there wasn't much happening. Ordered a drink for myself & my husband, drink was good but they had said ladies got half off drinks so I was surprised when it was $20 (but after reading reviews I see it's only on Wells drinks which we weren't told) still not that serious. Our drinks were pretty good & it game in a large glass. We left maybe 30 minutes after arriving because we just weren't vibing. My visit there was maybe 3 stars but I'm putting it down to 1 because the bartender double charged my Card. I felt like he was gone with it for too long. But he only had me sign one receipt & so I didn't think much of it until I checked the next day and saw it twice. I waited a few days to see if it would post after pending just in case it was just an error with my card but NOPE. There's one with the tip pulled out & one that's just the flat $20. So now I have to go through like a looooong process with the bank to get $20 back. $20 isn't much but I'm sorry I'm not willing to let go of it, not willing to have said I spent $40 on a Malibu pineapple & a crown with sprite! I called the bar & they weren't really willing to help me so it didn't have to be a process!",

Guess this place is cheaper...  Since there was a large group of us, we were put in a private back area that was super dark because there were barely any lights...between this private area and the main bar at the front was a large dark void of empty tables and chairs that they don't use because again who would pick this place when there's a Yard House downtstairs!   The good news was that happy hour goes until 7 pm here so we had access to $3 beers and $5 apps even though we arrived after 5 pm on a Friday. The beer and food was also mediocre. The only redeeming quality was the waitress who was efficient in serving our large group by herself. It was also nice that we had our own TVs in this little open room to watch the World Series. Just wished they would have multiple channels on at the same time, instead of having all 6 of our TVs switched on the same baseball game!",

We explained that she said it was because they were reserved. He said, well we sat right down. As he went to ask her why hadn't they been seated, she proceeded to argue with him as well. Long story short, fuck this place!!",

Walking in we noticed the music was techno / hiphop-ish. ????  We sat at the bar, ordered a Guinness. The waitress was great, and she poured a great pint, the right way. (Thats why it gets 3 stars)  Looking at the menu... Nothing food wise that was Irish, maybe the stew, but the waitress wouldn't even recommend it.  I had the Blue Burger...  $13 no fries. The fries were another $4.  It was good, not $13 great though. The $4 came on a saucer...about a small size at McD's.  So, this is a high priced  burger joint, with Irish decor and kilts on the female help...",

If this was a review regarding the service would have been 5 +  for sebastian (I'm pretty sure) he was great.. Attentive quick helpful good attitude.. The problem came when i tried to use my non chip having debit card.. The owner has changed policy and will only accept cards with a chip as payment. I was surprised because i had been on their website and saw nothing mentioned.. So my option is to go outside and use the atm that will cost me over $5 top use... I asked to speak with the manager.. Not sure of his name..(if this was a review on him and his ability to deal with unhappy customers i would have given him 5 as well) he was quick attentive but in the end they don't make policy so there wasn't anything he could do. Luckily Bill had a card with a chip to take care of it.. I can just imagine the d-bag that owns this place making that policy change.. So i needed to vent about my unhappiness.. I try to mostly post when I'm very happy with something but this needed to be said... Then i saw that they have a 2 rating as it is... That d-bag doesn't care... But big thanks to our server and the manager",

We sat at the bar and asked for a food menu. The bartender rudely responded that the kitchen was closed. So we decided to grab a drink first and then head to yard house for some food. The bartender was not at all friendly. He seemed annoyed that we came in even though the bar was open and not closing anytime soon. We asked what was in the margaritas as in what kind of tequila and the bartender responded \"everything is tequila based like every margarita\". Okay, thanks for the sarcastic remark bartender. I always say, if you don't want to interact with patrons then don't be a server or a bartender. Don't be a jerk because you don't like your job. The drinks were okay but nothing spectacular maybe because it was served with a bad attitude.   I won't come back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.",

Good thing I had a Groupon because I would never come here on my own free will and pay normal price. Waiter also seems to not care about your table anymore if you only drink water with your meal. We only drink water, stupid way to treat paying guests. Will not be coming back here. Corned beef isn't even that tasty, it's sliced in squares and tuff to chew.

The front door men are always rude, and requires you to stand in the long lines, once you step out. The last time I was there, a security guard was hovering right over us. Second time, another came over and pick a fight with my cousin, while we were having a great time. Management needs to evaluate the security teams ethics. The bartenders are great, but Security teams needs to take classes on de-escalation, because both times, I witnessed them be aggressors, and unprofessional. I'm asking for Management Team to evaluate these issues, because my perspective of McFadden is that I am not welcomed, from how Security has treated myself and my guest. Won't be going back!",

Nothing seems to be able to stay open at this spot above Yard House in Town Square. McFadden's itself is pretty huge but instead of marketing itself as a restaurant/bar it feels like they try to be a club instead. On most weekend nights you can see a long line of people forming outside the entrance. I think most of them couldn't get into at Blue Martini or didn't wanna pay cover at Stoney's and figured Mcfaddens was the next best thing.  Inside you can try and get food off their menu if you find someone to serve you. The drinks are overpriced for the venue and for what you get. Beers come in around $8 and cocktails are a few bucks more. You can get a wider selection of brews downstairs at Yardhouse and better drinks at Blue Martini.  During my last visit I was thinking about ordering a drink from the bar but was too afraid of having it kicked into my face by the random women that are allowed to dance on the counter. Apparently the people playing beer pong don't mind scooping a filthy ping pong ball off the dance floor. Im sure the water cup sanitizes it just fine.  The place can get sweaty and muggy but the outdoor patio is nice, remember to come early to secure a good seat outside. Also for whatever reason they can only split a check once so large groups beware!",

Maybe it's because it's right upstairs from my favorite restaurant Yard House or maybe because it's just really close by but the thing is this bar is horrible it has horrible music which the DJ doesn't stay on a fucking song and then like the bartenders you always have to like flash your tits at them. Do not go to this place!",

I used the restroom and put my drink down to wash my hands. I guess he thought I wouldn't notice, but he put lotion in my drink. I approached him and asked him \"Why would you do such a thing?\" And he got defensive and asked me \"is there a problem?\" He eventually got me a new drink, but the guy was an a**hole. That same night there was a big fight towards the end of the night and it killed our vibe. I used to like McFaddens, but after that night, I don't recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "My review is strictly based on the nightlife scene, not the venue as a restaurant. When you walk up the entrance, you get carded by a security guy.  The two different ones I've seen were both nice.  There are hostesses as you walk in, and most of the previous reviews nailed it when they described the hostesses as spacey and just not all there.  Now when I go, I just bypass them and go in and find a seat at the bar.    The first night I was in here, they had JUSt opened and it was beyond crazy.  Luckily our bartender, Khara, was superb and fast and we never really had to wait long for drinks.  The second night I came with a big group and hung out in the patio area, which was awesome!  The bar was consistently slammed but as we waited people eventually left, opening up seats at the bar.  I think for such a busy place, they could probably do without seats at the bar, but it worked for us!  The bartender was awesome and got us our first round.  It was kind of slow to get drinks, but not moreso than anywhere else that is extremely packed.   Overall, I think McFadden's is a great place to come when you want to go out drinking with your friends and don't feel like venturing out to the Strip.  It's always good to meet people.  It's fun and crazy and casual. I like it!",

My friend had a jersey on and had been let in around 10, and at 2am, he got called out by a security guard for having a jersey on. He had gotten hot, and tied his over shirt around his waist. They escorted him outside and told him to put his other shirt back on. My friend got frustrated, and one of the guards yelled \"you better watch out, before you get shot\". That is the most disrespectful and disgusting comment I've ever heard any bouncer/security Give at ANY club. This place desperately needs new bouncers. No one should be singled out because of race. Terrifying for me and my friends to experience.",

    "text": "Oh McFadden's.  When you were at the Rio you hosted one of the most memorable St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  The new location at Town Square is certainly set up to entertain, with three bars (one outdoors), a beer pong area, DJ booth, dance floor, photo booth, and karaoke.  The mechanical bull that was here previously was replaced by the DJ booth, and not a mechanical leprechaun as I was expecting.  (Don't look at me like that.  Rattlecan had a mechanical pickle that you could ride.)  I came here for happy hour, which goes from 4:00pm - 7:00pm daily and gets you 1/2 price appetizers and draft beers.  There are also daily specials for each day of the week, and are offered open to close: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcfaddensvegas.com%2Fspecials.php&s=6166e7a24f09f7be8c8e80f0f9c45718b489e542f896d8648ea1fd27f7d7490b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mcfaddensvegas.com/speci...</a>.  The happy hour drink specials are decent, you'll end up paying $3.00 - $4.00 for a pint; nothing spectacular.    The big surprise came from the 1/2 price appetizers; these dishes are huge!  At most you'll be paying $5.50 for an appetizer, and that will be plenty for you to share with others.  Between three of us, we had left overs after ordering four appetizers: chicken fingers, Irish nachos, crispy shrimp, and king crab and artichoke dip.  Everything was good bar food.  Service was really spotty at times.  I ordered a Bumblebee, which is a Boddington's with Guiness layered on top.  When the bartender made it, he poured the Boddington's from a can, even though the menu showed that it was one of their draft beers.  And when it came time to pay, it was almost a 30-minute ordeal.  Nothing deal breaking I suppose, but if it's not happy hour, I'm not sure that I would stop in.",

The bride and groom had arranged for us to have a large area in the back to sit, for 20+ people, but when we arrived there was seating for about 10. It took about 30-45 minutes to get the seating that we needed. When the server finally came by, she let us know that our drinks were all half price with our wristbands. The Irish Nachos and Blackened Chicken Nachos were good with plenty to share. Service was incredibly slow, even allowing for the fact that it was a Saturday night and that there were a whole lot of us ordering. When I was ready to settle the bill, I let the server know that my drinks weren't on there half price and she said that specialty drinks weren't included in the half price deal. I said it would have been nice if she'd told us that, no one knew that and she stated to several people that all drinks were half price, she just responded \"sorry!\". Needless to say I was unimpressed.   It was a fun night, since we were there celebrating, but I wouldn't make a repeat visit.",

If you like cheap beer and shots in a plastic cup, this is the place for you. \"Dude, wanna hit McFadden's tonight and hopefully get a handful of STD's?\" \"Oh, for sure brrrro!\" I love waiting 15 minutes to get some well whiskey and Bud Light!

Well water for now, she walked off with an attitude for sure and we couldnt understand why?? Third: when our food very expensive $14 hamburgers came out they both were BURNED all the way thru!! My friend and I just looked and laughed at each other wondering is this mess for real?? We were going to send it back and just eat the Parmesan garlic fries BUT they were cold and then we asked where the hell is the parmesan??? That was it we had enough, asked the nicer waitress that was eventually assigned to us to just cancel the entire thing, we were out!!  I had purchased a Groupon for this and I can see why they need to advertise, BUT I will be asking Groupon for my money back because this was the Worse I have ever had since I have moved here to Las Vegas.

We decided to split the meal because normally we have a hard time finishing our own. It took so long for someone to check on us. It took a long time to get our food as well and they brought the appetizer with the entree. Food had hardly any flavor. We had them go half and half on the fries. We chose the steak fries and sweet potato.  We maybe had ten of each kind of fry. The tarter sauce was ok nothing to write home about. The marinara sauce was watered down and tasted mostly like garlic. They had 2 and sometimes 3 waitresses, but really only was one. She mostly attended to the patio. We waited for 30 minutes to get the check, and another 15 for her to get it and bring it back. She checked on us once during the whole time we were there. While we waited for the check, I saw one of the bar tenders come from the bathroom scratching himself then return to the bar. The bathrooms were awful. even my friend said the mens was a disaster. In the women's bathroom, every stall had an issue. It was either clogged, leaking, wouldn't flush or wouldn't stay locked. There was toilet paper on the floor. Only two sinks worked.  We had a great time hanging out together, but we will never come back here. We love Irish pub's. Even though our heart belongs, to only one in town, we give them all a chance to see what they offer. They charge too much here for how little they give you. They have only two choices for desert and they are pricey.",

They said it is all gang related! Not one of his tattoos is gang affiliated. While sitting there trying to figure out where we could go we saw numerous caucasian males let in with the same attire as our friend that they did not allow in. As I approached the three \"security\" guards I asked them what the dress code was. They pretty much said its private property and they could allow whoever they want in. They told me they didn't like my look because I have purple and blue hair and have tattoos so they could pretty much tell me I'm not allowed in if they decided to. The group I was with consisted of entrepreneurs, a very well known model and business owners. We were planning on spending quite a bit of money here for the birthday celebration but I will never step foot into the is place again. I consulted with a friend of mine who is a civil rights attorney and she suggested I pursue this legally. The way the \"security\" guards talked to my daughter and I was a form of intimidation and at one point one of older security guards had to tell one the other to back off because her approached her looking like he was going to physically touch her. I asked for their names and they refused to give them to me. Looking at other peoples reviews this has happened a few different times. I plan on taking this as far as I need to.",

Excuse me but I am a grown woman not a little child getting drunk here! Treat people with respect! I just wanted to ask something real quick. F THIS PLACE! It's is super TRASHY, crappy drinks, DIRTY INSIDE, and to top it off security were jerks??? No way, no how will I ever go here again and neither should you. It's a bunch of 21 years olds that are sloppy drunk and trashy. I pray this place goes out of business. McFadden's is a big NOPE!!!!",

I know the guys love to drool over the girl bartenders in the short skirts but it would help if they actually could make drinks...everytime I've been here the guy bartenders are spot on with drinks working circles around the girls who look like bimbo barbie to meth-head megan with not a brain between the two! Really hate that the guys have to split their tips with flippin eye candy!",

You can simply tell them \"hey it's this way actually.\" This location has been renamed at least 3 times. This place will close down too like the others",

I wanted to just walk through and have a few drinks and see if there were any attractive women at the bar. I was met at the door by what appeared to be some sort of bouncer. He was the most unfriendly bouncer I have ever met at a door. He asked for my ID, and after he inspected and found I was clearly 21 he mumbled \"$20 cover charge.\" I said, \"WHAT?\" He repeated \"T-W-E-N-T-Y D-O-L-L-A-R-S!!!\" What a punk. I said \"no thank you, I wouldn't pay O-N-E D-O-L-L-A-R especially after being spoken too like that..\" I will never go back. I am guessing this place will be closed within 6-12 months if they don't change how they treat people.",
