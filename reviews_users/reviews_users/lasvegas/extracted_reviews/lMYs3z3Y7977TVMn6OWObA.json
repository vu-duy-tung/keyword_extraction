The waiter walks us to our table immediately and before we even sit down, or the rest of our party arrives, asks us what we want to drink. Can we get within five feet of the booth first? Jeez. Food is adequate, basic, and not worth the cost they are charging. Both burgers were cold and the waiter didn't take it off after we said something. Had to get a manager. Won't be back here again",

Lots of messy tables when we first got there, but they were cleaned up rather quickly after we sat down. The boy cleaning the tables used the same rag to wipe down the booth seat and then went straight to the tabletop with it. Grossed me out a little. A big no no in the restaurant industry.",

    "text": "We ventured out early saturday morning for a treat of breakfast which we have not done for a while other than Fausto's around corner from house. We decided to try Black Bear Diner in Henderson. It was not too busy yet as we arrived and were seated right away. I ordered my morning Diet Pepsi and Josie had coffee. Drinks brought out right away and order was taken promptly thereafter. My soda got low and a second was brought right away. (Yay Soda). Now here is why 3 stars. As I stated it was not particularly busy or full, so having to wait for food was perplexing. We were told after about 15 min that our food should be up in a few. about 5-8 minutes go by and we are still waiting. No food in the pass as we look at kitchen. One waitress then another start asking kitchen for food. One waitress said its been 40 minutes. Wow! upon hearing this the couple one table over stood up and left no order ever taken. We finally got our food after 35 minute wait. They said the printer was not printing the food orders. Down side to computerized order taking.   I have only worked in a few kitchens but as a cook if I do not see orders printing but can see guests coming in I would wonder what was up.   Food finally arrived. I had chicken fried steak that was neither great nor bad just average. Eggs and hashbrowns. Hashbrowns undercooked. I'm sure due to rushing them off grill because food was behind. Wife had Pancakes and bacon. Again nothing stood out bad or good.   Not sure I will go back due to nothing standing out. May try dinner sometime.   No offer for beverages taken off or a discount for inconvenience just a chuckle type joke from the manager taking tickets at register.   If you are Hungry and want a big meal check it out. Make sure food ticket machine working though.",

Of course you're met with the decor of a log cabin.    I chose to indulge in the Chicken Avocado Club with fries.  This triple stack sandwich had a great balance of chicken, avocado, cheese and blt. It was a very tasty sandwich and too much for me to eat in one sitting.  That only means I have dinner for later.  :-)  The French fries are good but not great.    For dessert my friend and I split the Cinnamon Apple Cream Pie.  It was ok.  I will say it is more than enough for two to split.    Service here is ok.  I think our waiter could have been a little friendlier.  Once he dropped off our bill he didn't want to make eye contact with us.  We had to flag him down to get dessert.     I'm sure I'll be back to try out another meal.  Hopefully the service is improved.",

It's was great.  So, I anticipated ordering this dish at this Blackbear dinner close to my home. I've been at this location twice in the morning on separate occasions and both times been told that the cook hasn't started cooking the steel cut oatmeal yet. Really? Out of curiosity I spoke to the manager and was told that the cook could start the oatmeal and it would be ready in 20min. So I asked how could you cook steel cut oatmeal in 20min? Then I was told that the cook had started the oatmeal an hour ago and it would be ready in 20min. However prior to taking to the manager, I was told by a waitress that I could have their 2 day old oatmeal. Needless to say I declined their oatmeal and won't be back to this location. Why have steel cut oat meal on their menu and not have it? Went to Rachael kitchen instead as they always have steel cut oatmeal available.",

After receiving our coffee and OJ our friendly waitress took all 6 orders. I went with the chicken fried steak wirh potatoes, eggs, biscuits and gravy. The portions of food here are ginormous and even the biscuits were massive. I only ate half of my entree and half of 1 of 2  biscuits & gravy.  My clients breakfast plates were huge and satisfying.

It came with scrambled eggs and hash Brown's, or at least that's the one I chose. Hash Brown's were above average and the scrambled eggs were pretty good.  One thing I really like is their pancake syrup contains real maple syrup. I just wished that it was pure, or made with cane sugar. Still tasted better than regular pancake syrup.  Will be coming back here to have some other menu items. Am definitely pleasantly pleased.",

    "text": "Date dined 2/1/15.  We walked into the old Chili's location to find it turned into Dennys meets lodge.  They were quick to greet us, but there was quite a large throng of people waiting, so I was not surprised at the 1/2 hour wait time.  However, there were only two people sitting at the counter.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that we could sit there without the wait!  We love to sit at the counter anyway.  You get a real sense of the place by seeing the kitchen, wait staff, and expeditor working.  The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We ordered coffee (fantastic) and OJ because I loved their fresh squeeze machine (also fantastic) while we perused the menu.  I wanted to try a bit of everything, so I went with the Bears Choice for $8.99 and picked scrambled, 7 grain pancakes, and bacon.  The eggs & bacon were standard, but the 7 grain granola pancakes were divine!  No butter or syrup necessary.  The BF must have been nuts because he ordered the Bigfoot Chicken Fried Steak & eggs meal for $11.99.  It sounds ginormous because it is!!   The steak is smothered in gravy and it comes with three eggs, hashbrowns, and two biscuits as big as my head!  He liked it very much, didn't even make a dent.  Upside is it gave me an opportunity to try more stuff (hee hee) and let me tell you the biscuit is amazing.    We had a really good experience.  I loved watching their expeditor work because he really ran it like a well oiled machine and caught stuff like an under cooked pork chop from going to a customer.  We will be back.",

    "text": "Today 11-15-18 my family and I came into order dinner as a pre thanksgiving as my son would not be here for the holiday. The booth that we was sat at only had 2 place mats and silver ware, we was told they would bring 2 more sets as there were 4 of us. They brought out our drinks first and then we ordered our food. I had drunken my first drink and asked for a refill, the waitress walked by a couple of times no refill, but a few minutes later brought out my salad and my moms soup. My mom had also orders a biscuit instead of a corn bread muffin and was told that she can't substitute the items unless she wanted to be charged $3.00 for one biscuit, really? Again I reminded her we needed 2 more sets of silver ware and some refills on drinks. We continued to wait all while the waitress walked back and forth around us and no utensils or refills. Finally after having sat there for almost 15 minutes no utensils we decided we were not going to stay and continue to be treated this way. As we were leaving the hostess that sat us was bringing refills but no utensils still. As I explained to her why we were leaving she said that the waitress was given a extra table so she was busy. I told her that she had walked by not giving any other table food or drinks, and had not checked back with us. This was the most unpleasant time I have had at a restaurant in my 17 years in Las Vegas, this town is built on service and this should not be how you treat your patrons.",

    "text": "Born and raised in Long Island, New York  the diner is an institution that is a part of my heritage. Now living in Las Vegas, my heritage was on the other side of the continent. A couple of years ago when I was motoring on W. Tropicana Avenue I hit the jackpot when I laid eyes on Black Bear Diner. It was guaranteed I would try it. After two meals there I was impressed. However, it is a drive from Henderson to Spring Valley to enjoy a diner. But something happened. Santa Claus gave Henderson residents and myself an awesome Christmas present: a brand new Black Bear Diner. This would rejuvenate a former Chili's that had been a sight for sore eyes the last couple of years.     When I bestow 4 star ratings and the food is 3 to 3.5 stars, exceptional service or a unique environment could top it off to that level. In the case of Black Bear Diner it is the later. The bear theme is welcoming, entertaining, and unique. When customers walk toward the entrance, a family of bear statues are an omen of what awaits inside. In the vestibule there are couple of bear statues. Inside the diner, the bear motif is prevalent. However, this location is missing the menagerie of stuffed bears that make the Tropicana Avenue Diner a quasi-stuffed bear museum. On the table, the menu is displayed on newspapers. Nearby the menu is a history of Black Bear Diner that is rich in bear lore. In its own way, Black Bear Diner reminds me more of Cracker Barrel than a greasy spoon.     Being a diner, there are so many choices. I visited during dinner. I selected the meat loaf diner. It included corn bread with either a soup or salad. I went with the chicken noodle soup. It was fresh and delicious. It included mixed vegetables and a choice of potato. I went with the mashed potatoes with gravy. The abundant portion equaled quantity and quality. With a bottomless Coke, it came to a little over $16 before the tip which the waitress certainly deserved.     The waitress was friendly and professional. It was brought to my attention that a few Black Bear Diner employees from California were assisting with the grand opening.     It is worth mentioning that the kitchen is exposed, where the customers could see the cooks making the food. In a way, the cooks were part of the entertainment.     Black Bear Diner is down the street from me. I not only intend to return to Black Bear Diner a few times. I intend to try at least three different items from their menu then ultimately incorporate them into a review update that will be part of a list of  \"restaurant in focus\" or another name I come up with. But in the mean time, \"Happy New Year!\"",

    "text": "RAWR! The corner of Green Valley and Sunset has turned into bear country with Black Bear Diner!  Good to see that this family diner based in No Cali has expanded again with a corporate location now open in the Green Valley area of Henderson.   Happy to have a place that serves breakfast all day and is open early and past 3pm unlike the breakfast places in the area. The newsletter type menu also lists lunch and dinner plates too!  Country homestyle comfort is the cuisine here. Sweet Cream waffles and pancakes, Country Fried Steak, Hot Tuna Melts, Pot Roast are just some examples.    The serving portions are pretty big. Enough to feed a hungry bear. Even the cornbread muffin we had was pretty good size and more than enough for one person.  Cool points - They recognized the health & calorie conscious crowd . Sections throughout the menu list:  \"Fit and Focus: breakfast offerings under 500 calories  \"Little Less\": smaller portions of some of the breakfast, lunch and dinner items. I ordered lunch from this section which was a Tuna Melt and it came with your choice of side;  fries, housemade potato salad, coleslaw, green salad OR cup of soup.   They allow <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsubstitutions.IE&s=685781770b88b8af658f8051c858fa57af8887106dcb65bf28b08a8610e7a869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">substitutions.IE</a>..If you are vegetarian or want gluten free they'll switch out the bacon for fruit.   Prices are a great value for what you get.   Quality of food, fair/good. Many items made in-house, the oranges are freshly squeezed thru an industrial sized juicer.   Execution wise..needs more work...The hashbrowns on the first visit we got were not drained well enough and was a bit greasy.  Our second try at it we ordered it to be more crisp...still greasy..sigh.. Sweet Cream pancakes were okay. At least they weren't dense but not that fluffy either.   Orders took longer than should be and first time they got my order mixed up with Mr. B.  ..minor glitches, but cutting them slack since they've been open less than a week.  Not a fan of servers closing out the tab and giving you the receipt and you pay cashier..it's more convenient yes, but it just feels more rushed and you don't see your server much after they hand you the ticket.   Atmosphere - Casual but not feeling the rustic lodge feel like their Redding location.  But every location is different and unique in it's own way. So since we're in the desert it's faux lodge ish.  They did a great job revamping this building that has been an eyesore for the past 3 years. Great use of space, plenty of booths and tables.There's even diner counter style seating in front of the partially open kitchen.   I was thrilled to see and hear that the same guy still carves all the wooden bears (with a chainsaw) It was tradition when we traveled we would make stops at Black Bear Diners and our kids would take a pic with the bears that were 3x their size.  Service - Great personalities! Friendly and eager to please. Still needs work on a few areas.  Both visits we sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before anyone came and acknowledged us and take our drink order.  They apologized though for the wait. Some of the employees from their Cali restaurants flew over here to help out and train as the \"Opening Crew\" .   Really 3.5 but rating 4 for for value and for the choices they offer... plus the nostalgia won me over.  In time the Green Valley crew will rock the fifth star. Welcome to the Hendo hood Black Bear Diner!",

Waiters were yelling at each other and the cooks were yelling back too. It was an awful experience. But, this place needs a lot of work. Id recommend to retrain the staff before you decide to have patrons inside your restaurant. This being their second location you'd assume this isn't their first rodeo, but apparently it is.",

Our waitress Tara, was very friendly, but she was very busy, we got our drinks, then it took a while to get our order. When she brought out the soup and salads, se explained the were out of cornbread muffins. We finally got our meals, and my rib eye was tasteless and had that crud you get when you take a piece of meat out of the freezer and fry it. This is one of the reasons I don't like chain restaurants.  But I was a guest.",

We arrived at 9:50 pm. This shouldn't have been a problem since according to Yelp, they close at 11:00 pm.   STRIKE 1 - When we walked in, half of the restaurant was already shut down.  STRIKE 2 - The booth we were seated in was so close to the table across the aisle we could hear them breathe. STRIKE 3 - There were only 3 servers, one of which stayed at the counter despite there being no paying customers there. So, the busser took out drink order and brought them out to us.   STRIKE 4 - My fries were cold. I didn't feel comfortable asking for freshly made fries since I saw the cook staff braking down the kitchen and I'm almost certain that process involves chemicals I'd rather not have mixed into my food.  STRIKE 5 - We learned they close at 10pm as the table behind us complained to the waitress then the manager about cold food, poor ambience, and severely lacking customer service.   In all, this place may be good at other times of the day. According to the manager, business dies down around 7:30 - note to self, come before then.",

The hostest was nice and even accepted all my corny jokes. Service was excellent! My cup never went empty and Ashton made sure we got everything we needed and more! The coffee is great and when they brought out the plates...OH MY...they were huge!!!! Only constructive criticism is that I ordered the eggs Benedict and the yolks were hard...but I still really enjoyed my meal regardless!! So good! Will definitely be coming back!!

Remember seeing one in Bullhead City on our numerous trips to Laughlin.  When you walk in, you feel like you're in a mountain lodge. Cool vibe. The menu is loaded with lots of options, so many that when the waitress came around I hadn't made up my mind on what I wanted.  I ordered the Turkey Club Sandwich. Man, it was HUGE!!! Along with a side of fries, I only finished half but it just meant I could take the other half home for dinner. Great flavor! Our server was amazing. Very attentive and super friendly.  At the end of the experience, Mom and I both said it reminded us of a souped up Denny's. Same type of food, but with \"bear\" sized portions! I will definitely be back to try other things on the menu. Have to have the breakfast experience!   Oh and by the way, they have a jukebox! How cool is that?",

I have visited this spot twice and both times left with a full stomach and a whimsical grin, contemplating the next time i will visit again. My first time there I was quite the hungry beast so I opted for the ribs, got a full rack a salad, 2 sides, biscuits and a drink for $15. 2nd visit Grabbed one of their amazing burgers which was a beast, had to flatten it in order to chow down. The staff up front is very helpful and greets you promptly while entering the door. The waitresses I had for both visits were top notch, always making sure I was supplied with ample amounts of food and beverage. They use quality ingredients, the salads are made fresh daily, the fruit is always ripe and Delicious. They have their own bbq and hot sauce which is pretty good.Give this spot a try if you are in the area and want some good eats for a good price.",

    "text": "I have been to one other Black Bear Diner a couple of times but was rather unimpressed. Tonight, however, I am happy with my meal. I got breakfast for dinner which, if you ask my family, they'll tell you I am not a breakfast person. It is rare that I eat it. But every once in a while I get a craving for corned beef hash. So that is exactly what I ordered. I had not tried it from here before so I did not know what to expect. I was not expecting all the options for sides. Most of which contributed to potential carb overload.   What kind of potatoes? Pancake? Waffle? Toast? Biscuit? What kind of eggs do you want? The answer, for me, was home style potatoes, a biscuit and sunny side eggs.   My food came out fast tonight but tasted overall fresh. The hash was amazing. It was full of corned beef that was recognizable as such along with small diced potatoes. The potatoes in the hash made the side of home style potatoes rather redundant. For that reason I packed the home styles home for later. The eggs I mixed in to the hash. I like the yolk to run throughout the meat. As for the biscuit, OMG, it was a fluffy monster of a biscuit. It was a great biscuit and absolutely huge. If that is what they use for their biscuits and gravy then I will be back for that.  Yes, tonight I had a good breakfast for dinner sort of meal and even brought home some leftovers. For a total of $11 and change, not a bad deal. The Black Bear Diner in Green Valley has given me a new perspective of the chain and restored my faith in their ability to give me a good meal. I'll be coming back again.",

Until I saw The Gobbler sandwich. It's basically a Thanksgiving sandwich with avocado and tomato. The kicker is the marble rye bread (as recommended by our server). We got sweet potato fries as a side and she recommended ranch dressing as a dip. The entire meal was the bomb!  I brought the menu home and looked for a location near me. Bummer, 50 miles away.",

The pineapple was baked inside, which made it loose most of the juice that you would keep in a pineapple Upside-down cake. Basically, I wish I'd had a ton more pineapple.   I think my husband's Rueben was the real winner of the day! It was piled high with plenty of meat and all the flavors were spot on. Even the roasted rye bread that looked pretty ordinary had fantastic texture - toasted on the outside and soggy on the inside.   Both couples decided to share a Chocolate Cream Pie. These things are huge! They're served in a very deep bowl. There's an Oreo crust, the chocolate Cream which was a nice balance between pudding and mousse, a thick layer of whipped cream and is sprinkled with chocolate chips. While the whipped cream tasted heavy and oily to me, I loved the other components. The Oreo crust and chocolate chips added some great texture. And frankly, I could've gone for five more layers of the Oreo crumble!!  I certainly hope to visit here again soon. When we do, I would totally revisit that Rueben. Then maybe try the Chocolate Lava cake for dessert!",

They also will tell you they don't make the bear claws anymore...huh?!   But what will make it easy to never come back here is the issues with unsanitary conditions here.  The busser cleans the tables and picks up the dirty glasses/silverware with gloves on, which would be nice except he doesn't change his gloves and then he puts clean silverware and napkins on \"cleaned\" tables.  Having gloves on doesn't mean you don't have to wash your hands!    And the last disgusting thing to happen was i got severe diarrhea from eating here.  I ate here at night then the next day is when I got really bad diarrhea.    Stay away from here unless you want explosive diarrhea.",

Ordered pot roast with double green beans salad with ranch my son ordered meatloaf with the soup and onions rings with green beans.  Soup came out quick salad as well.  First negative menu stated soup or salad and corn muffin one muffin brought not 2 but 1.  Ok I let that pass food comes oil obviously too high the onion rings cooked on the outside and uncooked onion on the inside not good meatloaf top notch.  Green beans excellent best part of my meal.  Pot roast was not impressive loaded with fat ok I make it at home and the fat gives it flavor but if you get 1/3 of the main course in fat that's less then desirable.  Next the vegetables obviously not cooked with the roast as they were raw.  The potatoes were raw the carrots worse the celery hard the veggies were not good I'm almost sure they were zapped in the microwave hard chewy tasteless.  The pot roast was probably the worst I ever ate sad considering it used to be one of my favorite restaurants but I'm going to give it one more college try and if the food has dropped from excellent to mediocre like tonight I will find someplace else to frequent...... more to come soon!",

Watch out because the portions are huge so don't over order (unless you're my mom and love to squirrel away biscuits.)  Sometimes we get small problems like forgetting something we ordered or something not being cooked right but it's rare and it always gets solved quickly.

I had their corned beef hash, French toast (which is delicious by the way), and sausage links. For the hash. I'm used to just cracking open a can of that store bought, salty stuff for breakfast and theirs was far different from that. They use their own corned beef which is great and you can taste. My most favorite however is the French toast here so far. I could eat plates and plates of it. There's nothing fancy to it, but for some damn reason it just makes me want more of it combines with syrup (Duh). They have desserts that you can have with your breakfast as well. I didn't have any of the desserts, but they do seem good. Rumor is however that the banana split pie is most popular there. So if any of you guys have it, \"Please do review on it!\" Other than thee above its a chill place to have breakfast if you want a good, simple, and delicious home cooked breakfast. The service was great as well and our waiter was very helpful to us so I really don't have room to complain about this place. \"Give it a try!\"",

    "text": "Went in on a Saturday night at 7pm. Did not have to wait for our table.  Was sat down by the manager and he took our drink order. Shortly after our waitress took our meal order. Took a bit for our shake to be made but it was tasty. When our meal arrived, they had taken it upon themselves to add cheese to the top of my spaghetti instead of asking if I would like any or how much. Once I took a bite into my food, I noticed the lack of sauce and how dry the meatballs were. Not tasty at all. The staff also left our refilled cups on our table our whole meal. Something we've noticed was how unorganized the staff were at finding their tables. They were asking each other who ordered what food and where it went.   A waitress did notice I looked unhappy with my food and offered to get me a free burger & fries. I believe it's called a \"Bob Burger\". When we got our receipt, they had also took my spaghetti off my ticket.  I do have to mention the Bob Burger was tasty, flavorful, juicy and filling. I loved every bite of it.",

While we waited, staff cleaned three tables that vacated near us, filled two of those with new guests and served a drink to the table with new guest behind us.  At 1:44, John passed, paused, and said he'd be right with us.  Then he walked passed us again and proceeded to take the order of the lady who was behind us that was seated at least 20 minutes after we were.  At 1:45 we stood up and walked out - didn't need to pay for anything since we were not even served drinks.  And John acted surprised to see us leave????!!!!

They've got a bacon cheeseburger in a bowl. Perfect for this L.A. girl to feel like she's still eating a tad bit healthy.   And I mean, the pies. THE PIES. When we sat down, we were hungry to the nth degree, so I of course ordered too many things (yeaux leaux) and we eyed those desserts the whole time we ate! We got full halfway through our meal, but I was determined to order a pie before I left. The waitress laughed at how excited we were - I even sang and danced as it got wrapped to go! My friend and I shared a coconut cream pie and I literally have no ragrets. Not even a single letter.   I enjoy places that have an open diner bar/kitchen window and more than generous portions. Black Bear Diner also has there hot sauces and other cute souvenirs for sale in the front.   I will definitely be returning the next time I am in Henderson.   I still need a photo with the adorable bear family out front.",

Normally, my son has no problem finishing a plate, but he actually brought half of them home. The rest of my party ordered pot roast, meatloaf, a cuban sandwich and a bowl of soup and 1/2 of sandwich. Everything was cooked well and tasted great.  They also make all of their own ketchup, hot sauce and steak sauce without high fructose corn syrup.   Highly recommended!",

Checking back every minute while we're still looking at the menu, it's like: Really man? We're clearly still looking at the menu.

(This review is based on breakfast only..no experience with lunch or dinner)  I've eaten at other Blackbear diners and likely judged them on the 'Merica clientele and oversized portions.   This time I went with an open mind and looked past the oversized portions by sharing a plate and couldn't see some of the diners because they were wearing deer hunting camouflage.  We also had a great, attentive server.  Pretty sure he was a \"bear\" himself, which made us feel more welcomed.   We split the Bear's Choice with pancakes, eggs and bacon.  The bacon was thick and tasty and the pancakes were pretty hearty with a really great buttermilk flavor.  Splitting was the best, cause this plate was huge.  The coffee was a nice blend, too.   The host staff was real chipper, I'm sure it's the grand opening enthusiasm, but I wish this place well and I'm sure we'll hit it up again.",

Super large portions. People smiling I think I'm going to like this place. Food is coming out I am not disappointed at all the sweet cream waffle is amazing. And such a huge portion for a freebie. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star review was the wait.  The place was relatively empty but  I waited probably about twice as long as I would at a Denny's . The bottom line is I'll be back and next time I will bring my wallet.",

The hollandaise sauce is kind of sweet which made it extra delicious, eggs perfectly cooked, delicious thin ham on a tender english muffin... yum!! Would definitely order this again. I love the flavor of their bacon especially extra crispy. Their coffee is excellent and gets refilled often. Husband said his french toast, bacon and eggs was excellent! They offer breakfast, lunch and some dinner entrees. They do offer smaller food portions as well but I love taking some home. I have always enjoyed Black Bear's food. Love the bacon cheeseburger salad. They are obviously doing something right because we are seeing the restaurants pop up throughout the USA!!",

Update. I used to love BBD but it has gone downhill. They tried to serve me old, cold burned hash browns and the omelets were a lot smaller and so were the pancakes which were raw in the middle.

We had a 15-minute wait before they were able to sit us the three of us down, but it gave us some time to check out the branded goods the diner sells (look for the mini-bottle of honey!). I didn't have too much of an appetite, so ordered off the Little Less menu that the restaurant states provides \"Smaller portions of our same great comfort food. Perfect for seniors or those with a lighter appetite.\" However, the ham & cheese omelette seemed like a full-on meal with the omelette, hash browns, and bowl of fruit! It was a great deal for $7.99 and I wonder if perhaps it's just a way to give senior citizens a discount. Good job, Black Bear Diner!  A couple folks had their birthdays and the birthday dessert looked great even for a morning meal. Only hiccup was that the waiter stated watermelon was included into the fruit bowl, but it only included grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, and strawberries. Food is super affordable for what you are getting. This is a great joint in Henderson and is recommended!",

The service is friendly. There's a great variety on the menu and anything I've ever tried from Black Bear Diner has been delicious. Certainly nothing fancy, but reliably hearty portions (with smaller ones available) and good food. And you gotta love the bear theme - too cute.",

It is in Henderson, but I would drive out there during our next visit. Thanks Black Bear, JAY",

These are the entire family reports so far:  Breakfast, pancakes are awesome , Pot roast is pretty good. Basic breakfast is just that basic don't expect much. The huge hamburger had very little taste, the tri tip dinner was AWFUL!!! Pies are to die for.... Dinner in general is a stretch.. best to keeping it to a signature lunch dish or breakfast...  We stopped going here and will go back to Weiss down the street.... maybe someday we will go back for pancakes... The wait staff was nice...",

Our waiter was nice, he had certain characteristics as all the rest of the wait staff...very southern, warm and welcoming. The food is great... appealing presentation and the quality of the food was better that I was expecting.. Fresh squeezed orange juice, literally they have a machine that does it in front of you. Try the pancakes, sweet cream pancakes are the best I have ever had..... My father is big on diners and he approves! I'm glad about that, I have had enough of IHOP! But seriously, give black bear diner a try, you wont be disappointed.   *** I was raving about this place so much to my BF, we went to the location on Tropicana near his home and he loved it as well! I would however suggest the green valley location, its a newer building and I was feeling the atmosphere way more than the trop location.",

Problems from the start.  My wife's salad had rotten grape tomatoes on it and she was brought regular french fries.  When she pointed this out to the server he said they do not have garlic fries.  The chicken was a breast that had been pounded into a pallard, marinated in lemon and coated prior to frying.  The coating was falling off and was saturated in oil.  This is NOT southern fried chicken. My dinner was NOT the smaller portion I ordered, it was the full platter.  My food was okay with the exception of the vegetables.  My suggestion to Gerald (our server) would be to write down the orders so you get it right.  Very nice young man, but saying they don't serve garlic fries when they are very clearly on the menu is ridiculous.  To the kitchen staff, if you offer southern fried chicken, it better be southern fried chicken and not what you brought to our table.",

I ordered the special, spinach and mushroom eggs benedict and my husband ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  I was surprised how long the food took, when it wasn't busy at all. There had to of been maybe 7 tables with customers. What was the most disappointing, was the food was cold when it came to my table.

I have had bacon at other local breakfast spots and they don't come close to Black Bear. Its thick and flavorful.

But I've been there twice, each time we waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. The first time it was busy, so I could understand from my experience working in a restaurant. Second time wasn't so busy and we still waited. But whatever, I can handle waiting at first.  One of us ordered a lemonade, and before he even drank half of it, it spilled on the table. The waited didn't ask if he wanted another, and after his glass had been empty almost the entire meal and he asked for another, she said that she'd have to charge for another.  In both our experiences working at restaurants, it was always a common courtesy to refill something that is spilled.  We tried to keep an open mind and try again but we've been disappointed each time.  I'm sad to say this but I don't think we'll be returning.",

The dinner on the other hand is profound 1 star. The fried chicken was over prepared, under seasoned, and honestly tasted horrible. If I'm doing dinner I usually try the vegetable and mashed starch ( potatoes) option. For some reason I went with the fries and they were not good at all. The green beans with bacon saved this dish from being sent back. Even though the waitress asked me how everything was I just couldn't bring myself to tell her. She was so nice and I knew that the words I had in my mind to express my dislike for the meal would not have been pleasant at all.

Inside and outside (no live animals were hurt, that I know of)  So I went to Black Bear when I was in Utah, and I wanted to check it out to see if it was the same.   It reminds me of restaurant chains similar to Denny's and IHOP.  Note this location is busy so don't come starving.     They serve breakfast lunch and dinner ALL DAY.   My family and I came here for breakfast and portions are reasonable for the price.  The food is good/ok, nothing to brag about, but not bad either, same goes for the service.     After my visit I found out you get free coffee and a bear claw for signing up for their rewards card program ... maybe I'll do that if I ever come back here.",

I ordered the corn beef hash, eggs, and cinnamon roll French toast and it was easily the most delicious breakfast meal I've had in years.    The corn beef hash was authentic and \"home made\" (not out of a can) and cinnamon roll French toast was incredible.

    "text": "I mean it's a chain diner. So nothing is really over the top good, it's either A-OK or Meh. My experience here was just OK.   During the main brunching times this place is packed and I mean lines out the door. It's largely a family and grandparents dining place so don't expect people to eat quickly or things to be super flavorful. I chose to sit at the counter, which was empty and gave me a first hand look at chaotic food runner station.  I ordered a specialty Black Bear Benedict, a benedict with shredded pork and prepared in the Huevos Rancheros style. This was ok and the portion was huge, so big in fact that I didn't finish it, which is really saying something, but massive portions don't necessarily mean massive flavor. This was lacking in the spice and salt area, hence a diner fit for grandma and the kids.   The service here was attentive and surprisingly quick during their busy brunch service. The one thing I did notice was small pile of trash that had been left by the previous eater at the counter. My server walked by it at least four times before a busser who was dropping off glasses noticed it and cleaned it up. Not a major thing, but what if that had been old food and not paper straw covers and napkin bits?   If you enjoy bland food and crying babies in the distance than this is the place for you. Sorry Black Bear Diner I just don't get it, but maybe when I'm 65 I'll call this place home.",

The waitress was trying hard to be overly bubbly that she wasn't listening. She brought the wrong vegetables & drink. Also I asked for a medium steak & it was medium well. It tasted just Ok. The cornbread they offered were very dry. In the end, I guess she got annoyed that we didn't order our dessert right away & she took our menu away without asking us anything. I'm not impressed & won't be back.",

From the moment we walked through the doors it was a pleasant experience,  it was packed with people, but we were seated right away. The atmosphere is whimsical with little black bears,  a  vintage looking news paper holds the actual menu inside. And let me tell you, it is a BIG menu (a lot of selections), I had the Shasta scramble, and with my first bite I was saying \"oh my GOODNESS. \" The veggies were FRESH,  I actually tasted the Avocado,  tomato,  onion, spinach, not just egg. The super large home style biscuit was great as well. I don't recall the name of my husband's meal but the  Corned beef hash was not 'hormals' from a can. It was real corned beef they make it themselves.  Long story short  (not) go and check them out.",

I could not believe all the trash laying on the f floor from sugar packets, lettuce, fries, and even miscellaneous debris of from who knows what.  Then i ordered water for my husband and i with lemon on the side. When we received it, it lemons were in our glasses which i wanted on the side. Later when she got our refills i asked for lemons on a separate plate.  I actually saw her grab the lemons with her bare hands. I never saw her wash them. I saw her collecting cash earlier for another table. How gross!  Needless to say i never used the lemons due to my disgust. I can't say I ate my meal with pleasure because of all the previous sightings.  I will not be returning here. Good luck to whoever goes here. You'll definitely need it!",

My husband got the hobo omelet with hash browns and biscuit and I had the corned beef with hash browns and English muffin. Portions were huge, food was good. The only down fall of this first time experience was: 1. Waitress (Trina) some what came only once to check on us and what we didn't appreciate was getting the bill just 3 minutes from getting our food. I understand it's busy but at least give us some time to enjoy the meal. 2. On the other hand another waitress (Tori) was a LIFESAVER, she came around with refills for coffee and asked if we're doing ok. She went above and beyond to even get the manager since the corned beef that I ordered was overwhelmed with whole pepper corn. I can say the corn beef could've tasted better without the significant amount of it.  3. Thank you to the manager that comp the corn beef and tried to accommodate me with another dish.  GOOD customer service for that.  But I suggest Trina need more training on waitress skills or ask Tori for some pointers. I will give this restaurant another try since it's still new.",

We went on a saturday night. Got there at about 7:15 didn't leave until about 8:50. The main issue I see is that their is one person working the cash register and seating people. So If their is a line of people trying to pay for their meal then people needing to be seated are gonna have to wait. We waited quite a while. Finally we got seated. From the looks of things they are usually under staffed so everything is a wait. We waited a good amount of time to order our drinks and it took a lot of time to get those drinks. Our food order took forever. Now keep in mind the place isn't packed. They have a good amount of people but it isn't like crazy hectic busy. Our server seemed like he was on in berzerker mode. He told us he had been there since 8am and was working until closing. So I think it supports my theory they are understaffed. But food isn't bad. I'd stay away from the chicken pot pie. They put a ton of mushrooms and the pie itself is quite small compared to say Claim Jumpers pot pie.",

The service was awful. This is no exaggeration - it took 10 minutes to be greeted (I should have left then), drinks and ordering took another 10. Typically when I have my kids I ask that their food comes out whenever it's ready instead of waiting for the whole table. I made this request and was told that they would take care of it. My son ordered waffles from the kids menu and I ordered a burger and fries basket. The burger comes dry so I asked for BBQ sauce. 24 minutes later a get a dry burnt burger with no waffle or BBQ sauce in sight. I asked the runner who delivered the food for BBQ. Another 3 minutes pass and the waffle, the meal due out first, arrives. My son finished his waffle before I even received my sauce and could start eating, and he is by no means a fast eater. Throughout this whole experience we saw out server at the greet, when we ordered, once during the food wait when he asked if we wanted more water, and finally at the end of the meal when he delivered my first and only refill and the check at the same time. I give the diner 2 stars because he loved his waffle and wants to go back. I keep telling him to ask grandma because I like to actually eat my food when I go to a restaurant.",

I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes and gravy, but the corn beef was really salty and dry. But, to be fair we were coming in late in the day so it was probably cooking all day. It wasn't busy when we ate dinner. The dessert was okay, the brownie tasted like a chocolate chalk like brownie. Once again to be fair, I was so hungry earlier I burnt my tongue on the chicken noodle soup earlier, so that could have been a factor. I think I enjoyed the soup more. The corn muffin was delicious. I think if I come back again I'll give something else a try. You know when there's no holiday special.",

I've not been to any other location but the one in GV is nice.  It can get busy during the normal busy times (early breakfast, noon, Sunday brunch time) but they've always handled the crowds well and are pretty on it with wait times.  Time from ordering to food in front of me was 15-20 min which I think is not bad considering the place looked to be full to capacity.  Every time I've been, the server was attentive and kept our beverages topped off while we waited.     Their food has always been more than satisfactory.  It's diner food....so when you take it for what it is you will not be disappointed. Pancakes, eggs, chicken fried steak, hash, burgers....I've had them all they've always been prepared well.  All portions are very large so there is value when considering cost which I feel isn't bad.  The good: Large portions, relatively cheap, clean facilities, suprisingly the huevos rancheros  The great: fresh squeezed orange juice, cinnamon roll french toast (phenomenal),   The bad: Steak and eggs were my least fav of meals there...steak a bit over done.  It's steak from a diner....It's not a steakhouse so I don't expect Prime meats seared to perfection.  Tasted fine...overall big picture I won't count that against them too much.",

The problem came with the pancakes. As I was eating the pancakes, I encountered a couple crunchy parts. I thought the tiny crunchy parts were crispy pieces of pancake, unfortunately i didn't find what the crunchy bits were until I got halfway through. As I cut a few more pieces, I found a small beetle in the middle of the pancake. It was cooked inside the pancake! I'm not one for confrontation so I spit my food out and left as soon as I could. You can see the small black beetle in the pancake in the photos.  ****RESPONSE**** How was it confirmed? Was an autopsy performed on my pancakes? It may have been ok if the place was called Black Beatle Diner.",

I waited about 40 minutes for my order, they waited that whole time to tell me they were out of the pie we ordered, they forgot my wife's soup and cornbread muffin, the food was cold (probably ready right after I got there and just never brought it out) and then they basically offered nothing as recompense when we told them about the missing soup. Everyone has a bad night where it takes 40 minutes to sit three parties in and put up one takeout order in a half-empty restaurant, I guess.",

All of the staff was extremely friendly and my server, Marlaina was very attentive, knowledgable about the menu and her recommendations were delicious.  Our food arrived quickly, about ten minutes after ordering. We ordered the Tri-tip sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. Both extremely tender, the pulled pork has a wonderful spicy kick to it, but not too overwhelming.  Marlaina checked on us appropriately, and had a great personality.  The only thing that was going to keep me from giving a 5 star review was the carpets were very dirty, but they were cleaned during my visit and considering how great everything was and how busy they were, I'm going to stick with a five star.  I will definitely be back and I recommend you try it out too!",

The one we used to frequent is quite far from us but they've recently opened this location in the green valley area and one very tired night I was craving pot roast and I knew the exact place to come to. That is my go to order here. The portions are huge it's always delicious and I always have more than half of my order to take home. Boyfriend wanted pot roast too but I told him to order the turkey and we would share. It's a smaller portion and didn't come with soup or salad like the larger order so next time he said he will go with the pot roast. They have breakfast available all day and typical diner food. The service is always good and the food comforting. Great family place to come too especially if you love bears!",

French toast with a waffle and lots of fruit is what make me the happiest. The chefs are experienced and knowledgeable so if you want something a little off the regular menu they can normally handle it. They have 2 locations in Las Vegas and Henderson. The lad Vegas location is on the corner of rainbow and Tropicana. The Henderson location is on the corner of sunset and green valley. If you want an excellent diner, this is a great option.",

Tonight changes that all unfortunately.   The menu had plenty of items that were not in stock and we could not order. Then the food took so long to come out of the kitchen I was ready to pay for my iced tea \"which the waitress said they do not hand out straws for\" and eat somewhere else. There were 5 of us and the meals came from the kitchen two at a time with 5 minutes in between and my veggie burger came when everyone was half way done eating. Plus my veggie burger was not like the menu said... No chillies or pepper jack cheese.  So in a city like Las Vegas with so many choices this Black Bear will have to improve or close their doors.",

It was good but fried a little too long. Mashed potatoes and gravy were good and the green beans were canned beans with bacon and onion thrown in. Coming from the South this is typical for green beans. The minestrone soup was regular institutional soup that probably came in a frozen brick. I liked it. My wife had the meat loaf which was very good. Being \"seniors\" and not being terribly hungry we had the smaller portions and it was perfect for us. I should add that we had corn bread muffins and they were very good. Don't expect gourmet dining but expect good down home food. We will go there again.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Coffee Huckleberry Bear Claw Short Stack Sweet Cream Pancakes Thick Cut French Toast  Recently opened in Henderson, with a 2014 visit to the Tropicana location still relatively fresh in my mind, it was entirely at the behest of a friend who quickly responded to a Facebook post looking for breakfast recommendations that the twenty minute drive to North Green Valley Parkway took place and although the decorative cabin decor is nowhere near as comprehensive as the Northwest location Black Bear Diner's recipe for success was otherwise faithfully replicated with competent down-home classics served by a team of smiling servers as ignorable top-40 filled the air overhead.    Largely unimpressed by the 'traditional' Bear Claw during my prior visit suffice it to say a repeat was not high on my list of things to try, but with my buddy signing up for the Bear Lovers E-Club scoring a free coffee and one of the pastries the warm Huckleberry iteration proved a modest improvement on the cold almond paste, though the doughy lack of lamination and lack of filling in the 'toes' still left much to be desired, particularly for an item dubbed a signature.  Fairing far better than the 'appetizer' it was of two 'Griddle Vittles' that the rest of our breakfast was comprised and although the French Toast was decent but largely forgettable the 'secret recipe' of buttermilk and sweet cream constituting the base of two airy pancakes was worth every cent of the modest $6.49 tab, fake maple syrup aside.  A mere $10 each after tax and tip when taking into account the E-Club discount Black Bear Diner is perfectly fine but having now visited both local locations and trying the pies, pastries, French toast, and pancakes there's really no pressing reason to return, particularly in a city with no lack of local places turning out equal or better food at a similar cost.",

    "text": "This was a terrible experience and I'm usually an understanding if not forgiving person. Where to start...the location is new and I have heard good reviews, but their recommendations where at different spots.   Black Bear has this family, down home kind of feel to it with stone and log architecture and black bears peppered throughout. Staff was somewhat friendly and not rude. Our waiter was very inexperienced and I could tell the manager was helping in the kitchen, but ignoring the dining room. The restaurant sports \"comfort food\" and if fried food is comforting then this may be your spot. However with this type of statement when I order lemonade I expect a home recipe not minute maid!  I ordered the 6oz tri-tip with shrimp and mashed potatoes an gravy. My wife had the fried chicken with baked potato. Both came with seasonal vegetables  (I want you to remember this!) A cup of clam chowder was my starter and the Mrs had salad. When my wife asked about salad dressing the waiter says \"We don't have Italian or french.\" So my lady asks again which dressings they have - he repeats himself adding they have everything else. Um...unless you carry every type of dressing in existence don't give half assed answer like that.   Oh by the way I never saw my soup. Turns out they ran out of it but I didn't get to know that gem of truth till after our food was served.  My tri-tip was undercooked and very chewy. My wife's chicken was so dry you could probably rub it together and get fire.  The seasonal vegetables, yeah - you would think that a statement like that would mean it is a batch of tender veggies to spread across multiple plates. Evidently with Black Bear they make different batches and cherry pick who gets what. I got green beans and my fed up angel got squash and zucchini melody. Neither are bad really but just hammers in the final nail of inconsistentcy.  We didn't even bother with desert because we were already so underwhelmed with our experience I began to feel bad for the tree that gave it's life to be our bill paper.   Their a month in and I hope they get the guidance they need. Breakfast may be better, but I will never know. Black Bear is now off my radar!",

Placed in a converted Chili's in Green Valley, this restaurant is at a great location with tons of parking and many other shopping places close by.  It's also next door to a public library.  The evening I went was very busy; the wait time wasn't fast but acceptable.  The decor favored black bears, for obvious reasons, with a very rustic/mountain feel.  It was easy to tell it was a small-scale chain due to their professional menus and their own brand of ketchup and hot sauces (all 3 were delicious: papa, mama, and baby bears! haha).   The menu is typical diner fare, which is exactly what we were craving.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served at all times.  I opted for the California Eggs Benedict and was in love!  The food did not arrive quickly, but was worth the wait.  My eggs came with fruit and potatoes, the latter of which was not on the plate.  As an apology, an full sized plate of the potatoes were brought to the table (I thought there was no way I could finish them, but I was wrong- too delicious to pass up).  The food was an excellent value; the iced tea was strong and tasty.  The restrooms were large and clean.  The staff was very friendly and helped each other.  I wish I had one of these close by!",

While the restaurant is spacious, clean and new, and the staff is all very friendly....The kitchen seems to be struggling a bit.  My Mom and I were shopping nearby and decided to stop in for a late lunch.  As we entered, we were greeted by the cashier, who was assisting other customers.  She said she would be right with us, but unfortunately had quite a long line.  Luckily, we were approached by one of the servers who sat us.  We were both very hungry and this is definitely the place to go if you have a large appetite!  The young lady who sat us also turned out to be our server, and she was very nice.  I ordered the French dip, with mushrooms, onions and Swiss cheese added. On the side were fries.  My Mom ordered the small CFS breakfast, with eggs and hash browns.  Neither of those items seem very complicated, but they took a REALLY long time to get.  We were seated near the kitchen, so I could see that there was a bit of chaos.  There was food being sent back for being the wrong order, food that sat in the window for a long time before being delivered, and servers all over the place.  This is somewhat expected when a new restaurant opens, so if you go to a place knowing this, you have patience.  We weren't disappointed with the wait.  Our food was piping hot and fresh and delicious.  One strange thing was that my mom received the large portion of the CFS, which she didn't order.  The waitress told her they didn't have the smaller portion, so she just brought her the big one.  That is fine, but it would have been nice if she checked with us first - maybe my Mom would've changed her order.  Everything was tasty.  As always, the CFS was crispy and flavorful (I stole a bite).  My French dip was also good, but nothing special.  When we got our bill, the waitress had charged us for the large CFS.  I almost feel like she was trying to sneak one over on us - we had to track her down (since you pay up front) and explain that it was wrong and we shouldn't be charged.  She apologized and had a manager fix it, and we were on our way.  While cashing out, we decided to buy and take home one of their small banana cream pie (my Mom's favorite dessert). At $5.99, it was decently priced and REALLY good.  I love that everything is branded as Big Bear Diner - the hot sauces are Mama Bear, Papa Bear and Baby Bear, based on hotness.  Overall, a great place that I look forward to returning to.  Small bumps in service are to be expected, but I am sure they will be running smoothly very soon.",

It never fails that I always seem to encounter a server who doesn't want to give me service.  I will admit that I can be a picky customer, but asking for my salad to be made out of romaine instead of iceberg lettuce isn't a big deal is it?  Asking for a waffle breakfast that comes with eggs and hash browns shouldn't be that hard to get because this is a diner isn't it.  I'm listening to servers tell me why I can't order what I want and I'm just looking at them asking myself if they are kidding.  Who doesn't at least TRY to accommodate their customer?

Management comes around to talk to you which is nice because I hate when come around and just ask if you're ok and then just leave, it's like dude just leave me alone if you're not going to engage me. But they and great here and they have a little gift shop and Mama Bear walking around the restaurant for kids. All-n-all pretty damn good.",

Although the sandwich was asked to not be toasted it's SAT under the heat lamp for so long waiting for the waiter to pick it up that the lamp made the bread almost toasted. The sandwich did not have pepper jack cheese and he forgot my french fries. It took us 40 minutes to get her food after we ordered the table behind us it took them almost an hour. I would not recommend this for lunch our place to eat as you'll get back to work late. I think management should check into their servers and their attitudes towards the patrons. I  understand it can be stressful at times however my friend and I are always very polite to wait staff. This person was not friendly from the time we sat down",

The sweet cream pancakes are AMAZING. I had the Californian Benedict last time and the whole table was jealous...Hahahaha I tried the ScramBowl this time and it was great! Too big for me, but great taste, not bland. And ALWAYS go for the red potato option..the hash browns were alright, but had nothing on the red potatoes.

The jukebox is always playing good tunes and I have not had an issue with food or service yet. The reason for 3 stars, they don't take reservations / call ahead seating. We were celebrating my daughters birthday today and she wanted to have it here, she loves this place. We had a good size party with us and a call ahead would have alleviated stress on all ends. I understand not taking reservations but a call ahead is to let the restaurant know to be expecting you. They don't have to block an area off, but to be looking for you for minimal wait time. We have now been standing here for an hour and the hostess just came up to tell us that they have started blocking off tables for us. Food: great! Waiting service: great! Planning service: needs some work!",

Instead it was a tiny cup of something I could pay 99 cents for at the grocery store. My husband's burger was cold and had BBq sauce on it, not the hot sauce he requested. We had to request to go boxes the minute our food arrived so my husband could get back to work. No time to eat. Basically we paid $40 to wait 45 minutes for cold food. What a disappointment.",

I have to say service is great, friendly and warm.  our server welcomed us and mentioned pumpkin pancakes were on special today. my coupon was for eggs with waffle or sweet cream pancakes with bacon or sausage. I showed my coupon to our server and she said oh yes, that's the 'beards choice'. she asked if I wanted bacon, sausage or ham...I chose ham, then asked if I could substitute the special panckes for the sweet cream ones. she said sure, no problem. hubby got the chicken fried steak and asked about the gravy. she offered to let him taste it and returned with a soup cup full! he ordered a biscuit and she asked if he wanted gravy, he said yes as he was planning on having it with his gravy covered breakfast. I have to say my piece of ham was tiny, but for free I would not complain. I've had better pumpkin pancakes, but they were fine. then came the bill. there was a 99 cent charge for biscuit and gravy. I inquired, the biscuit isn't included? she said yes, but not the gravy.....after having gravy covered chicken fried steak and bringing a bowl to taste....really??? after my coupon the bill still seemed too high. I inquired and was told my coupon covers 8.99, yet my free breakfast was 10.99. nowhere on the coupon is there a limit, but more importantly why did I get charged 2.00 more for that breakfast? I don't appreciate the underhanded scamming. don't tell the customer they can substitute and not tell them there is an up charge. I guess this is standard practice and people don't complain. don't be ridiculous and charge for gravy when my meal already includes it. for these. check your bills people.....",

It seem to me that they did not have there shit together, I mean I love the place, but not this location. West side BB and Laughlin/Bullhead city is the bomb. This location need to step up their game if they really want to make BB proud. $80/4 persons down the freakin drain!! Buffet would of been a better choice cause food would have been hotter and quicker and saved some $$",

The steak  sandwich was dry, meat overcooked, and the burgers were also dry. The service was very slow  our server knew they were out of coconut cream pies, but did not tell us until after we had ordered them. I specifically asked for no sauce on my burger, but yet I ended up with 2 different kinds of sauce. My brother, who ordered from the kids menu , wished for a refill of milk, and the server wanted to use the same plastic cup. There was not a lot of meat in the salads, and the coffee ok and they were out of tea bags for tea .They also nickel and dime you. However, it was quite homey.",

At first, the prices might come across as high, but when you receive your large portion of food, you will soon come to realize that you are getting more than you are paying for.  When I typically come, I usually get either their pancakes or waffles.  Both of these are made with sweet cream instead of milk or water, which makes for a very fluffy breakfast dish.  My brother typically orders an omelet which he is never disappointed with.  However, during this visit, I decided to order their diner basket which was their cheeseburger, fries and a cookie n' creams milk shake.  The burger patty was cooked all the way through but still juicy, so no worries there.  The fries were cooked nicely and their milk shake was amazing.  I really love when a restaurant serves a shake and it's tin.  It makes you feel that your getting your moneys worth.  Overall, this is a good restaurant and I suggest you check it out.",

Our server was attentive and great! I wish we could remember his name. He seemed to be in his 20's with dark hair and glasses.

The bear theme is most definitely very present here. So right off the bat, it's a fun and neat place to dine. Breakfast is the happening time here. Though, if you go during the week (as opposed to the weekend), there's no wait and it feels practically empty around breakfast time. The portions are large, but not crazily large. The chicken fried steak I had was seriously delicious. The waffle was also a total winner. The menu is lengthy and the options feel endless. So many choices! And that makes this spot even more of a crowd-pleaser - there's something for everyone. It's a classic diner type place. It's comfy, casual, and easy going. But the food quality is a major step up from other similar places around town. All in all, I'm definitely a fan.",

When we pulled up I had the feeling like I had been here before and when I when into my thoughts from the past I realized that I had been to this place when it was Chili's.  Now it's BLACK BEAR DINER.  It's totally remodeled on the inside and has a log cabin look and feel to it.    One of the more disappointing aspects of the visit is that don't have appetizers.  I didn't know this and I was planning on totaling pigging out tonight. The kind of pig out where you take no prisoners or names.  So I ordered the onion rings which were amazing.  Golden crisp batter surrounded the onion and be prepared to wipe your hands after each rings...just a little greasy.    Next up....breakfast for dinner.  I normally default to breakfast if the other meals look suspect or I'm not feeling dinner.  The potatoes were the bomb.  The bacon was burned....badly.  The over easy eggs were just ok.  They weren't seasoned with anything so make sure if you order the eggs ask for seasoning.  The ham was great.  I finished my meal off with the pancakes.  They were awesome.  The substituted as desert.    Service was great!    With that being said if your looking for old school music and an old school feel give this place a try.  May the force be with you.",

They weren't on the bill and I watched our waitress write it down. So thanks for that.  2) When the runner brought out the food it looked great but she said to me \"as soon as we have more fries made I'm going to bring you some\".  I asked why because there were plenty of fries on my plate and she said \"Ohhhh no honey that's not enough \". It struck me as bizarre ...she came back another time and asked if I got more yet...I told her no....and then she never brought more. It was just weird.     The waffle and the root beer were legit. I'd like to come back and try some pie one day. There's just something....\"off\" about this place.",

I was seated right away and enjoyed the bear country diner atmosphere. Shanna was on point with the specials and was kind enough to let me know what was no longer available for the evening. I ordered the 5 ounce chicken fried steak dinner with mash potato, country gravy, and corn on the cob for the side. You have the option for a 10 ounce country fried steak, but I figured the 5 ounce with the sides should be plenty. Speaking of plenty, I also ordered The Big Bear burger with parmesan chips for to-go. All the food I tried was really good and not greasy or too salty as far as diner food goes. I also had the banana cream pie to go. Very good portion as well. Pie has nice chunks of bananas in it, but I think they used artificial banana flavoring to enhance the pie and it would probably do just fine without it. Probably would try a different pie next time though. Perhaps the coconut cream pie...overall, I would recommend this place. Really good service, good comfort food, and country cozy atmosphere.",

But, it turns outs, what stood out the most was how polite and friendly all the staff was being to everyone.

Our food came out hot, looking and smelling great! I had the Grizz, which really is a lot of food. It's 2 good sized sweet cream pancakes, 3 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausage links, a piece of ham steak and hash browns. My guy got the chicken fried steak and 2 eggs over easy, with country potatoes and a HUGE tasty biscuit. Yummy!  Notice what happened here??  YEP!  I got to try a BUNCH of stuff. LOL!   Our waitress asked if we wanted dessert.  Ummm NO!  We were stuffed full. But, we will go back just for pie sometime. Everything in the case looked really appetizing, and of course I love pie.                          I know this is a chain, but I'm happy to say that it felt like I was really eating at a local diner.",

I ended up eating lunch here a couple of months ago before a movie and it was a bad experience all around.   The inside of the restaurant has a grubby feel. Our waitress didn't take too long to come by and take our orders, but it went downhill after that. We ordered two sandwiches and waited for a long time. We even asked a couple of times how much longer it would. The waitress said the food was almost ready. My friend noticed that our orders were sitting on the warmer. We finally tracked down our waitress and she brought over the plates that we had spotted sitting on the warmers. The wait was too long for two sandwiches.  Our food was not good at all. My friend put it well when he asked how someone could mess up a Reuben? They had indeed messed up a Reuben. It was rubbery and not good. My BLT would have been good if it had been brought out in a timely manner. The bacon was crispy, but the hot mayonnaise concerned me so I didn't eat much of the sandwich. Our salads to start were fine, but took about 30 minutes to arrive.   Maybe we just had a server that was having an off day, but the slow service led to bad food. I usually will give restaurants a second try, but I'm not sure I will this time.",

I noticed that there was only three and a half stars but this is definitely a five star restaurant, with five star quality and five star service. I give credit where credit is due. Shout out to Chantel and Aaron! They were right at the front and greeted me with understanding and a welcoming smile. Thank you ! You made my day :)",

They seemed unaware that the guests could here them loudly bashing the restaurant, obnoxiously speaking about how they know high end restaurants do things. Then, for lack of better words, yelping and whaling. I didn't come to breakfast to listen to that. Obviously there was no manager on duty, or not one that cared how the staff acted.

Spacious, tons of cool decorations (bear themed of course), a dessert / baked goods display upon entering and a very friendly staff!  Biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak, and The Grizz (which has sweet cream pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage links, ham steak, and your choice of potato) were the choices the day we went. Pancakes were very fluffy and the syrup that comes with it is to die for! I really have no idea what kind of syrup that was and I forgot to ask but it is very different than your usual \"maple syrup\"! Wish they sold it along with the merchandise up front but they only sell their berry syrup. Chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Gravy could've used a little bit more salt for taste but was still good. My son loved their sausage, so much that he had to get another 3 because the 2 that came with The Grizz was not enough!  Portions are HUGE, so you get what you pay for!  Definitely a local joint and my type of comfort food! Can't wait for a return!",

We came there for the service originally, however after a year of coming here every Sunday to eat. I will now need to find somewhere else to eat. Not even a discount of 10% saying sorry I messed your meal up. Then to top it all off when I went to pay I actually had to wait until two hostesses finished their personal conversation. Horrible experience, last time for my family and I.",

    "text": "My friend asked me to breakfast since I was off today. She said we should try Black Bear as a change from the restaurant we normally frequent, right up the street from them. We were greeted promptly. Our server was good. Though, I felt we should worry when there was more staff than there were patrons. I really wanted to be objective. However, I could not help but compare the food to my regular establishment. And the food was nothing to write home about. I ordered an omelet and asked to add diced onions and diced bacon, but what I got was roughly chopped onions and bacon.  Despite ordering my side of bacon crispy, the bacon in my omelet was limp and barely cooked, to my standards. The one good thing was the freshly squeezed orange juice. $55 later and dissatisfied. We never spent over $30 at the other place. I decided I would pay with my credit card and leave a cash tip. I took it as an affront when the server took the check before we were finished and before we left her tip. She saw no tip on the slip and never came back. We left $10 on a $45 tab, despite her not returning to our table. I never write reviews, but felt that, if I did not, how would others know. Also, how would the employees and owner(s) truly know how my first and last visit to this restaurant went?",

I have previously eaten at the St. George and southwest Vegas locations, where both the food and the service were great. I'm not sure what is going on with the new Green Valley location. I'm giving this place one star only because my friend and I were seated immediately and someone quickly took care of our drink order. It was all downhill from there. We both ordered the 2 egg meal with pancakes and bacon. We were still waiting over 25 minutes later and no one came over to check on us. There was mass confusion in the kitchen and the wait staff were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Pretty sure another table mistakenly got our order and sent it back. We finally just got up and left. No one even noticed. Hopefully, management will get the service issues worked out, but we will not be back.",

    "text": "Well.....thought we'd roll the dice and try this place after my family and friends had a horrible experience here.  Why?  I have no idea.  Here go's!  First off.....Oh My God....The LOUD MUSIC!!!!!!  I felt like I was in a bar!!!!!  It was obnoxious!!!!!  Why they play such loud music on a Saturday afternoon is beyond me!  Manager must be a complete fool or just deaf!  Well.....we both ordered the Hand Carved Turkey Dinner.  Not sure where this so called turkey came from.....but I can tell you it was NOT HAND CARVED!  They give you two pieces of turkey on each plate....that were exactly the same size shape and thickness.....then they cook them on a griddle like you would a hamburger!!!!  I have never in my life seen turkey fried on a griddle and have it called hand carved!!!!  It actually had burn marks from the damn griddle!  What the hell is that?  They DO NOT cook \"REAL\" turkey at this Black Bear Diner!  Clearly they buy some pre-packed stamped out turkey product and call it hand carved.  It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever!  If I closed my eyes and ate it....I wouldn't be able to tell you what it was!  No joke!  The gravy was some canned salty gravy.  They definitely don't make that either!  The mashed potatos were ehh.  One plate had a huge mound on it....while the other plate had half as much.  No consistancy at all.  One was drowned in gravy....while the other had very little.  They veggies were nothing to write home about....just very bland and not much flavor. And our server....I believe he name was Brittany...she was no help either.  She acted like she was too busy to even take our order.  We tried to ask her questions about things on the menu before we ordered and all we got was one word answers as she looked around the dining room like she had somewhere else to be.  The place wasn't that busy at all....around 3pm in the afternoon....kind of an off time to have dinner.  Over all the food was NOT WORTH $32!!!!!  It didn't even come with soup or salad!  And that turkey product was horrid.  And the preparation was even worse!  So....we will never be back again.  Should have listened to everyone else that had a horrible experience here.  Shame on me.  And shame on Black Bear Diner for misrepresenting items on their menu!  This place doesn't hold a candle to the Black Bear Diner in Sparks and Reno NV.  If corporate owners ate here....they'd shut em down!  Because this location in Green Valley does not represent the REAL BLACK BEAR DINER'S!  This place reminds me of a knock-off diner!  If I go to a Mercedes dealership....don't try and sell me a Ford and say it's just like a Mercedes!  This diner is more like a fast food restaurant.  Save your money people.....go elsewhere!",

There were no place settings on the table when we sat down and none were offered.  My friend had to ask for place settings, menus for the two of us and cold drinks.  After that the waitress disappeared.  My friend then waved down a man to ask that someone take our order.  After our order was finally brought to us, no one, absolutely no one came around to ask if we were alright.  I knew then I would never return to this place, nor would I bring friends or family here.   My burger was good, but did not compensate for the lack of service we received.  Lastly, my friend asked to speak to the Manager and the woman she asked stated she was the manager.  She told her of our experience and she casually apologized and offered us both a dessert due to the bad service we encountered.  I declined the dessert and my friend asked that I please accept it.  I did to please her and when I arrived home, I threw it in the trash bin.  Sorry BBD, there are far too many GREAT restaurants in Las Vegas that have awesome food and incredible service to accept  or settle for your horrible service!  You lost a local and all of her friends and family; some of who live here in the valley and those that visit frequently.  Carlota, Henderson, Nevada",

For a family of four the price is to expensive for the bad service received.  Ice tea should not be $2.50+ cents.  Not like it is a cake or soda.  You take tea bags water and brew it.  Total cost to make is cents on the dollar.  Anyways the server tonight was apparently to busy to attend to me as a paying customer and when he came back to refill my Arnold Palmer he brings tea only.  Asked for meal smothered in gravy and I had to ask for more.   The wife meal was bland and actually I did not like it at all.  This is the second time eating there and my last.  To expensive.  Bad sevice.  Bad to average cooked meal.  I love a good breakfast this is far from it.  For this price I would rather go to the broken yolk or for the quality of the food i would go to denny's and have a better breakfast.  Good luck black crapt bear diner.",

I prefer my flap jacks or hotcakes or pancakes to not quickly soak up any syrup I pour over them... and these do. They are a little in the dry side and I end up using more syrup than I should. The eggs are eggs and the red country potatoes are yummy.   My recent visit left me with burnt red potatoes and I was an angry bear! Until Geoff came along and turned my frown upside down. My waitress must have seen all of the burnt potatoes that I placed around the rim of my bowl; she failed to stop and failed to ask how our meal was going. She was too quick for me to flag her down to alert her to my yucky breakfast. Suddenly Geoff appeared and looked at my food in disbelief. He told me that he would get me a new breakfast. I told him I didn't like to send food back. He looked in my eyes and said it would be okay, he would get me a replacement. He didn't want me to leave hungry. I honestly believed that he cared. I don't think he wanted me to leave hungry. He didn't know I had taken a picture of my burnt potatoes. He had no indication of an intent to SM rant. He just wanted to make me happy and he was so very sincere.  My yummy replacement breakfast was swiftly placed in front of me.   Thank you Geoff. You are awesome.

I had a club sandwich with turkey and avocado and my husband had chicken and waffles. From my photos you'll see it was one waffle with chicken tenders. Not surprising, and he ate it all, but it's always fun to see a restaurant put their own unique spin on it. My measure of success is: Can I make this at home? :)  I will say, service was great. Food was good enough. PIES are little \"single-serve\" pies, but definitely shareable and delicious.",

Chicken fried steak was the bet I've had in ages, if not ever. Biscuits were delicious, hash browns could have been a little more crispy for my liking. Coffee was also good.

The food was bland and pretty tasteless and special requests were left undone. The plate had a small portion of the meal you chose with a HUGE portion of the side. We threw away most of the hash browns which is disappointing to waste so much food. The kids biscuits and gravy were ginormous and my son had about two bites. One of my kids didn't get his sausage and the other didn't get his fruit bowl. My husbands hash browns were almost raw rather than the well done he had asked for and my meal, eggs Benedict, which I enjoy every other time I get them anywhere else, were tasteless, dry and over cooked. The men on the line in the back were making quiet subtle cat calls as I went to the bathroom too. The only thing I liked here was the hot sauce which is super spicy and has a really good flavor. You can buy a bottle to bring home. We will not be returning, unfortunately.",

It all looked so good, the host greeted me, asked me where I'd like to sit, signaled over the section and there I went. Think I was sitting there for almost 5 minutes without a menu or anyone in site. Was even contemplating whether or not to leave since that is always a bad sign. Finally my server appears was really friendly, attentive making suggestions. The menu was pretty basic, nothing was appealing I was even thinking of just getting a pie since those looked better than the food options. Nevertheless went with coffee and the California Chicken Avocado BLT minus the bacon on sourdough. Restaurant started to pick up, when I got there no one was there. The food was very bland, nothing stood out to me, regretted not waiting 20 more minutes for Trader Joe's to open. Unfortunately my server kind of forgot about me, she had given me my receipt when I was eating my food and I guess you pay at the host desk. Was waiting for her to come by to ask for a box since the portions are huge to only have her skip me as she checked on all the other tables around me. That was the moment 30% went to 15%. Nothing stood out to me, got so so service and don't think I'd go back to a Black Bear Dinner again.",

The food was cold not even warm but the microwave helped that.   The hashbrowns were not cooked.  There were several raw pieces of potatoe in the mix of all of them.  When I called back, there was no apology from any of the girls that helped me.  The girl put me on hold to ask her manager and the manager didnt talk to me either.  I explained what happened and drove back for my sausage, bacon and new hashbrowns.  I asked for crispy hasbrowns since the first batch were under cooked so the cooks thought it would be a great idea to make me potatoe chips... they were close to burnt.  One more thing, the biscuits and gravy were horrible.   I want to say the sausage in the gravy was burnt.  The gravy had a nasty burnt taste where we just threw them away. Needless to say, after about our 10th visit to this place... we wont be going back for a very very long time.   The cooks are horrible and the service at the front needs help... we wonder why artificial intelligence is replacing humans... you have to take advantage of the opportunity when it's there and turn the customers experience around.. in this case it was failure across the board.",

And even with just ordering a benedict it was more than enough food, so much so that I couldn't even finish it all.  The California Benedict comes with avocado, spinach, tomatoes on top of an English muffin, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. So so good.  My brother ordered the Grizz.

    "text": "Review - Breakfast  First time trying Black Bear Diner We ordered The Grizz Server- service was good, fast From what we could see, their portions were big, so my wife and I decided to split the meal. We asked for an extra plate. First issue, the extra plate was dirty. Had old food stuck on it.  As we were dividing the food, we found a hair at the bottom of the plate. We eat out frequently and have both been in the food service industry so we understand these things happen. We notified our server and she responded quickly that she would get us another serving. Strange- no apology, no comment at all regarding the hair. She was pleasant about the matter, but we were expecting some sort of apology/acknowledgment. Something to make the customer feel better about the incident. Instead of the nonchalant attitude.  Our new order came out quickly, I did ask for another plate to split the meal- same issue, the plate had food stuck on it again.  We tried to eat some of the meal, but both of us lost our appetites by then.  As for the food. Nothing special here. The home potatoes were the worst. Looked like boiled potatoes, no flavor, no seasoning. The bacon and eggs were fine, sausage was burnt on one side. The pancakes were dry.  I mentioned the issues when I went to pay. The cashier was very apologetic and made note of who our server was. Hopefully she will bring this up with her. We totally understand these issues happen. It's how the staff handles these situations that make all the difference.  All consumers have a certain level of expectation when it comes to customer service. Black Bear Diner did not meet that today.  We will not be returning to this Black Bear Diner. I'm sure other locations may be different but this first experience will make us think twice.",

They didn't overcook the omelet, which was relieving (many places do). I'd say the taste was basically average though and at around $12 I'd have expected a bit more avocado (as a comparison, Polaris Street Cafe has a better and cheaper avocado skillet).  It is much, much, much better than some places around the area (like the $12 hot dog truck), but I'd say this is basically average. So, 3 stars sounds right.",

    "text": "I love when restaurants can take you to a different place with their decor! It makes you think you're at a little country diner up north. The staff is super friendly and makes you feel like you've been a regular there for years.   I've been to this location and the one on Las Vegas Blvd but this one is so much easier to get into. We didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away. The menu has a plethora of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast being served all day is definitely a plus in my book!  I decided to go outside my comfort zone and get the tri tip dip sandwich. They have an option to make it \"deluxe\" which means it comes with melted Swiss cheese, grilled onions and peppers. The sandwich was just alright but like I said, I went out of my comfort zone to try something different so I think it's more of a personal opinion. The star of the dish was the sweet potato fries. OMG I could eat just those for dinner! Make sure to dip them in the bacon ranch, you definitely won't regret it.   The price for the quality and portions you get can't be beat. I'm excited to go back when I'm in the mood for pancakes.",

Even though I've gone to mostly all their locations, I always forget to snap pic or write reviews...but tonight stood out, so here I am :) Vibes were all around good tonight. Everything from  the greeting at the front by Zabi (the shift supervisor) to the service, food quality, overall cleanliness, to walking out the door!  Sara was our server who was friendly and knowledgeable. She mentioned that she was in training but I honestly had no clue because she was on top of everything. Moe, the other server who was also helping out with drinks had a really good attitude as well. The quality of the food was excellent, hot and hearty. We ordered the Reuben with sweet potato fries, the Western BBQ burger with a baked potato, and a Coconut Cream pie for dessert. Can't wait for my leftovers tomorrow!  I can tell that tonight's management was on point because all was well and everyone appeared to be in a good mood. They even sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a couple of tables which was nice--I haven't heard that in a really long time! On our way out, we had a nice little chat with Zabi, who was really cool  It's too bad I didn't get any pics, but I will definitely be back at this location sometime soon...especially with Fall coming around!",

Taste in general was horrible! I was gagging the entire time I was eating. I feel like crying I wasted $20.33.  Service was bad too but I understand coz only 1 server was serving like 5 tables. Food preparation was REALLYYYYY SLOW idk why-- they are not even packed. I came in at 3:15 pm, took them almost 6 minutes to have me seated. I mean I would understand if it's taking them forever to give me a table if they WERE PACKED, but guess what?? Not even 10 tables were filled that time! And there were 3 servers!! Idk. Bottomline is, this place sucks (or maybe the time I came in wasn't a good timing, maybe the good servers weren't on duty today or the time I was there, idk, who knows  all I know is this place is AWFUL)",

If I try a new place and that's an option on the menu chances are that's what I'm gonna have. If they do a good job with the burger I'll probably be back and the next time I try something different. But if they screw up a simple burger they won't be seeing me again. The burger was excellent!  We did try one of their little pies. I wasn't a big fan of them. Maybe I'll try a different flavor next time.  Anyway they have a new fan and I'm sure I'll be back.",

The parking lot has plenty of space, and the building and facilities are always clean.  The restaurant has a country diner feel.  They tend to be busy during expected peak times for breakfast and lunch.  More often than not I end up getting some version of breakfast when I go.  Wait times can be unpredictable, but fast food it is not.  I got the country scramble this time.  Sorry, too hungry and didn't take a photo before I ate.  However, the food was good!  Not sure about the scramble in the name, as the eggs were to order and not scrambled... but I digress.  Healthy serving sizes - biscuits with sausage patties, topped with an egg to order and gravy!  Really good stuff!  On past trips I've tried various other lunch items, but haven't found that great must have meal here.  Definitely worth trying though!",

Usually we come for breakfast, but the dinners we've had are also wonderful. The fried chicken with mashed potatoes, topped with country gravy is our favorite dinner meal.  For breakfast we split (no extra charge to split a meal unlike most places in Vegas) the classic eggs Benedict with a switch.  Instead of the Canadian bacon, we ask for their homemade mild sausage patty. Follow that with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ & you have a yummy meal!  Clean, affordable (by the way, they give military discounts) & jovial servers it has great background music playing & is a wonderful place to relax & have a great meal. Although all the servers are friendly, John or Monica are our favorites. Stop by soon & decide who is yours.",

We stood there for 5 minutes and were about to leave when she finally signaled another employee to come seat us. I assume she heard me say \"let's just leave\" so that is why she finally took action. I also assume the fellow that seated us was the manager    After a few minutes our server came and we liked him immediately. Smiling and friendly. We just asked for water at that time. When he brought the water we ordered. He was helpful in his answers to our questions. He hasn't worked there long so hadn't tried every menu item but did make some good suggestions. About 15 minutes after we ordered he approached me to let me know that they had run out of vegetables I had ordered. So he suggested green beans and I said it was fine. Now, when we were ordering our food, the table next to us was served theirs. A family of 4 with young children. In a few minutes we got a salad with watered down dressing, and a very good corn muffin. But that was it. Remember the folks that were seated next to us? They had finished their meal, had the table cleaned, and were about to leave and we still hadn't been served. Being seated where we were, we could hear the fellow I assumed was the manager telling his kitchen staff what a great job they were doing and that they were \"all caught up\". Funny, we still didn't have our meals, how could they be caught up? So we decided to give it 8 more minutes and then leave. Which we did. We stopped at the hostess station, told her we were leaving, she grimaced and apologized and we left   We won't be back.",

She was okay, she didn't seem happy, just okay. She recommended a few things that she liked. We ordered and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. I had the Juevos Rancheros, which I did not like the taste of the meat. Not the best I've had. My husband had the Chorizo burrito which he says was good. We were eating our food and not even 5 minutes into eating, Trina asked if we were interested in a bear claw or some other dessert. We declined and she gave us our check and told us we could pay at the front. We weren't even half way done with our food yet. She never gave us refills on our drinks, so that was a bit irritating. At check out, you walk to the front before you leave to pay. We were getting ready to pay when another waitress came up to the hostesses and said \"who took the tips off my table?\" And she was upset. It was awkward. Then she left and the 3 hostesses started talking bad about her. I payed and left. And I left feeling somewhat disappointed because I heard this place was great.  My second visit, we came for my sisters birthday breakfast. There were 9 of us and our waiter was John. John was by far the best waiter I've ever had. He had a great personality. He was funny and kept everyone at the table entertained while still helping out with our orders and anything we needed. He was constantly walking by and always had a funny comment to say. My food this time was great. I had the California Omelet which was delicious. Everyone pretty much enjoyed their food. This visit changed my mind on what I think about Black Bear Diner. Thanks, John!",

    "text": "We often eat here because it is so close to our home. 90% of the time the food is decent but we have definitely had some misses. We stick to what we know is good like the big bear burger, onion rings and chicken club sandwich. The biggest issue is the wait staff. The best server we have dealt with is shanna. she ways is smiling and very sweet. However, every time we have been in there we have experienced extremely unprofessional servers who talk down to each other, complain about each other and down right argue loudly right in the dining room. Often we only eat there out of convenience. We both have been in the service industry and find the attitude and actions of the servers to be completely unprofessional and downright appalling. However, Shanna is amazing. So sweet and always attentive and smiling. From now on we will always request her section. We have eaten there many many times and EVERY time experience this problem with the staff. Management needs to really get that issue under control. I am giving 3 stars for decent food and personal convenience of location. I will say that this is regarding the night staff. We have not been there for breakfast.",

Seating and ordering were relatively fast and even the food wasn't a very long wait, but that's pretty much where the service stopped. I ate my eggs, bacon, and sausage. I was about to dig in to my mini volcano of pancakes when I realized I had neither butter nor syrup. I patiently drank my coffee thinking certainly the server would come around to ask how things were. Not dice. For fear my pancakes would get cold I got the attention of another employee walking by and requested the condiments. They were set on my table with a, \"Here,\" and no smile which was slightly off-putting. I don't need you to be my BFF, but a smile would have been a good step toward recovering from forgetting my stuff in the first place. The server brought my bill and that was it. The food was pretty good. Loved the pancakes, but I'm not clamoring to go back or anything. Hopefully this is just symptomatic of being new, but, like a first date, it's usually downhill from there. We'll see though. I say give it a shot and see what happens.",

Not only because the food they serve is incredible, but because the staff they have is even more incredible! This morning I visited for the second time with my 9 year old son who has Cerebral Palsy. We went in to eat before getting him to school after a dentist appointment. There is an amazing human being that waitresses there. Her name is Beatrice. She saw Dom and just like I have seen in countless posts on Facebook, she did something that made me cry! She told me she had a daughter who was in a wheelchair just like my son and she passed away 5 years ago. She also told me my son, Dominic, reminded her of her angel. She told me she was taking care of our bill and the only thing she asked in return was if she could give Dom a hug. I couldn't stop crying. So thank you so much Beatrice and your angel girl! You are so amazing! Please go and show Beatrice some love! Black Bear Diner on Green Valley Pwy!  I will never forget your kindness today!! Never!!",

Biscuits bigger than my fist oozing with fresh butter and Black Bear's special clover honey recipe!!!!!  To make this a total memorable experience, Stuart Leitner, the General Manager stopped by to check on me to make sure I was enjoying everything and I felt it imperative to tell him about Tonya's pristine service.  He sat down and we chatted and low and behold, it turns out we both worked for the same restaurant, same location but different dates.  Small world!!!!  Arnold S has said many times in the Terminator movies \"I'll be back!!!!\" for of this fantastic food.  Thanks Stuart and Tonya",

The food blows away any other chain restaurant, and I love the servers. Especially Trina!! She is the best. If I had to find a fault, I would say it's in the host staff. They seem confused and really not sure what to do next. A good host is the conductor of a restaurant, and so far, they've not found theirs, but in their defense, it's still a fairly new store.  Overall, a great place for any meal of the day. Now I'm hungry!!",

The waitress was nice to take 1 of the burgers off the menu. Like another reviewer said, its too pricey for what it is. There was 3 of us, 2 burgers, 1 pancake breakfast and drinks. Now she took one of those burgers off so she charged us 1 burger, pancake breakfast and drinks and it was $27! Not worth it.",

For breakfast I had their chicken fried steak and eggs and their massive biscuits and hash browns, not the most incredible breakfast ever but so many good things to like about it so a solid four stars, I still wish they had a Cracker Barrel out here this isn't too far behind it Dinner tonight was a little different closer to 3 1/2 stars I have to try tip and ribs combo dinner with the try tip was very tasty maybe I'm just a person who expecting a bigger portion tonight and seemed a little under sized but very good flavor, and the ribs were nothing to write home about, but the tropical tea and green beans are very tasty and the mash potatoes a leith country gravy not bad and a massive portion  So 3 1/2 stars tonight, 4 stars last time, this is definitely a place I can see myself going to once every month or so it's not right down the street from me but it's worth a little 5 mile drive",

It took thirty five minutes for someone to take our order and the restaurant was not that busy. That was annoying. Then my food was not that good. I got the corn beef hash and it had no flavor. I hated it. Customer service was good but we had to wait a long time to get the bill and it was just an ok experience... Coffee was amazing though. Other then that, it was not the best and i probably won't go back.",

    "text": "Here's a solid diner. It's only pricy until you consider the monster portions you get as a result.  I came in with the want for a burger and a side of French fries. What I got was a giant burger and a full separate plate of French fries topped with cheese and an abundance of peppers. It was not only shocking, but delicious as well. The burger patty was cooked all the way through but still juicy, so no worries there.  The one comment I would have about service is that although they are nice, I believe they ask if you want extras but don't tell you that they cost extra. I got all of the extras and I paid a few more bucks for them, but in the end all of the mushrooms and peppers that got piled on my burger made it an even greater boss battle of goodness in my mouth.  I will be returning with the intentions of a meaty omelette, and as such I will leave another review. Until then, this is definitely a place to check out and return to.",

    "text": "Yesterday I had breakfast here with a friend, and really enjoyed the experience.  The restaurant itself has a very rustic feel - not very Las Vegas; think more along the lines of Colorado or even somewhere in the Midwest.  Very cool if you're looking for a place that isn't going to be full of tourists, or alcohol.  (Again, very non-Vegas.)  But that's part of its draw.  We went during off hours, so that's probably why it was mostly empty when we went.  We had a courteous server who checked on us often, making sure we had everything we needed and wanted.  And the food - ahhhh, the food.  I got the harvest pancakes with strawberries on top.  Wow.  So good!  The only thing keeping this place from a five-star rating - at least for me - is that there weren't many vegetarian options.  That being said, those pancakes are worth coming back for!  I'll be back here again.",

My ex ended up ordering his usual, bacon and eggs and loved it.  The coffee is always strong and good and very hot, we never have to wait for refills.    Service is outstanding as usual and Rubarb--our Black Bear always goes with us and they make sure to ask him what he wants to eat or drink.    :)  Most restaurants would just ignore him but of course he is their mascot.    hehe",

Overall I could definitely get over that. Food was nice and fresh. Our waitress was SUPER friendly.

The portions are large (we all got The Volcano) which is two eggs (more like 3 or 4) 3 large pancakes, bacon, sausage, the works. Food was made fast and was really tasty. The service was good. We mingled a bit, ( not sure of closing time) but we never felt rushed to leave. I don't live on this part of town, but if the opportunity presents itself, I would dine there again",

We ordered the chicken-fried steak, with biscuits and gravy. It was AWESOME. Cheers to the cook! Tonya was gracious and helped us out with every request- Even though it seemed she was the only waitress working. She must've had 20 other tables, which is weird,  you think there would be more help.... Anyway. .. We sat at our table of 2, and watched this man cockily walk through the place, cursing, treating the servers like crap. We got uncomfortable with his presence, so we started to pay attention- Another guest told us that this guys the manager and is known to throw things on other occasions- He scolded the employees, made a scene, and yelled at his employees behind the counter,  (Yes,  we saw it ) and huffed around like a little boy who just got his toy taken from him. We asked to verify who he was and his name is Stuart, the manager. Tonya had to apologize for his non sense when we asked about it..;  She let us know that this wasn't common for Black Bear Diner. I would recommend this place, BUT, whoever Stuart thinks he is, should be handled ASAP. That guy has some major power control issues.  Staff is phenomenal and deserve the upmost respect.",

There are other similar restaurants in town I like better but this is closer and still really good food. I would recommend against the tri tip dip sandwich.  It seemed a little light on the meat and I have had much better. The Chicken Fried Steak is really good and their Corn Bread is the best.",

Only one cheery on these big bad boys?? :( The sausage was fresh, not the pre frozen little tiny ones you'd find at the other places.

The place was cute, decorated with bears everywhere. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a big group show up for lunch and stress that we only had an hour, so don't dilly dally. We were done and out of there on time. This bumped their rating up a star.  I got the Small Club Sandwich with Chicken Tortilla Soup as my side.  The soup was pretty bad, tasted like can soup that they added additional cans of beans and corn to. The Club was very basic, nothing special. Something you can get anywhere. My other table mates got the Bacon Cheeseburger Salad which looked huge, everyone seemed to like it. French fries were definitely the frozen kind. French Toast looked pretty basic. The Double Bacon Blast looked a little light on bacon. The Chicken Tender basket looked like chicken tenders from anywhere. Tuna Salad looked small and pretty ordinary. After this initial visit I really doubt I'd return to Black Bear Diner, the food was too ordinary and I can get this type of food all over town.",

We all knew what we wanted to order, so when our server came to take our drink order she turned and was going to walk away until we raised our voice that we were ready. She took our order and left. They gave us a children's menu with nothing to write with. Our drinks were incorrect. When we called upon someone to fix these things no one came back. I had to walk to the front where there was 4 girls there speaking to each other, and was handed a non working pen for my kid. The server came back completely unaware that our drinks were incorrect, she fixed them. Our food came out, looked great. That's the best part of this is how well the food LOOKED. The waffle was a HUNK of dough internally.  The pancakes were so thick they weren't cooked all the way, so they smushed together when you tried to cut them. The hash-browns were crispy on the outside, but once again mushy on the inside. Yes the serving sizes are over the top, but that doesn't equate quality food. Overall, the service and food was not what I've experienced from black bear before. Sincerely disappointed.",

    "text": "First time here...  and the last.  After a day of Xmas shopping, we were hungry.  We spotted the diner from the road and were drawn in by large chainsaw carved wooden bear statues outside a knotty pine palace.  campy and fun.....  Thats where the fun ended.  Table for two, looking for tasty grub.  ME:  chorizo breakfast burrito, side of has browns EXTRA crispy please.  Companion:  Chicken parm (one of her favs, normally) and a coke please!  What happened:  Chicken parm was incinerated black, and my hash browns were albino white.  She claims her \"coke\" was really a pepsi, and felt betrayed by the waiter.  The breakfast burrito was a total disaster - rolled and cut in half, exposing a giant plug of ice cold refried beans, obviously from a can.  It was clear that the chef made no effort to 1) heat the beans, 2) season the beans, or 3) spread the beans evenly along the tortilla.  After some digging, I did find the chorizo, along with the eggs and jalapenos.  FORTUNATELY I recognize these things by sight, because none of them contained any flavor that might have identified them.  The chicken parm was similarly bland, despite the charring of the breading.  We were confused at the total lack of flavor in any of our food items; I even forgot to order w/o jalapenos, but I didn't notice until I saw them.  I really wanted to like this place, and the star is for the bears and decor.  But sadly, the best part of my meal was the ketchup.",

I recently stopped in for lunch, and I can definitely say that I'm a fan.  The restaurant is decorated quaintly, and definitely has that diner look and feel.  It's cute and the layout makes it appear fairly large.  Parking and access is easy.  The restaurant was clean and pretty busy during Friday lunchtime.  It does not look anything like its former self inside.  The menus are printed on newspaper, and both the adult and kids menus have lots of options.  The kids menu was full of really cool activities, so that's always a plus.  Breakfast is served all day, so you can't go wrong!  The portions are very large, and the food is super tasty.  I especially liked the homemade chips.  My husband was very impressed with the eggs benedict.  The staff seemed nice, but pretty rushed and a little disorganized.  Our waiter was friendly, but he mixed up quite a few things.  He was apologetic and helpful though, so maybe he's just new.  I will definitely be going back to this place to keep trying different menu options.  I am very impressed with everything considering it has only been open a few months.",

I only say odd because I don't think I've ever craved chicken fried steak lol.   Apparently, their country fried chicken thing wasn't actually chicken... it was beef! I honestly wanted to walk out right there & then lol. But we stayed & I ordered the fried chicken instead. But thennnn, I was reading reviews & people said they hated the fried chicken & it wasn't good. So I called our server over and decided to switch my order to the country fried chicken. The meal came with salad & cornbread. I loveeee cornbread & theirs was okay, not bad. The country fried steak thing was actually huge & I ordered the \"smaller\" one. The breading was too much tho & it's safe to say that I probably won't be craving it again. Lol   If I could give this place 5 stars, it's because of Michael (I think that was his name)! He was so nice & on top of his game. However, the food just wasn't great.",

    "text": "The two of us went to the Black Bear just before noon on Sunday, and were surprised that there was a long line of people waiting to be seated.  So we figured the locals must like the place.  They have lots of cute bear photos and statues, so the decor is rustic and pleasant.  After about 20 minutes we were seated and they took our beverage order.  Our beverages came quickly and we placed our order.  My wife ordered the turkey breast dinner and I ordered the wild salmon dinner with veggie soup.  It took quite a while for our food to come, which wasn't a surprise given the crowd.  First they ran out of veggie soup, so I got tomato, which was OK.  My salmon was pretty strange; it was brown,  overcooked, and dry.  The mashed potatoes and broccoli were fine (although I had ordered green beans).  My wife's turkey was some of that reconstituted turkey roll substance and also pretty dry.  Her green beans were saturated with butter, not good, since dairy causes her to have joint pains and she hates the taste of butter.  So I ate her beans and she ate my broccoli.  At least she could eat the mashed potatoes and said they were pretty good.  Her iced tea was also good and refilled promptly.  So $35 (plus tip) later, it was probably the poorest meal we've had in the Las Vegas area.  At least our dog got some simulated turkey, which she ate with gusto!  All the other customers seemed to be eating giant pancakes and monster hamburgers, which are probably better choices if you want to try the Black Bear.  Note that you have to pay at the cashier up front, which was also busy, so you have to stand in yet another line to settle your bill.",

My 3 year old loves the bears everywhere, and the jukebox.   The food is yummy. Last night my mom and I spilt a cinnamon roll french toast for desert, and it was soooo good! Just the right amount of sweetness.   I also ordered a side salad with ranch. Only downside is the the ranch has bacon in it. They don't have plain. Some people don't like bacon in their ranch.   In the past, I have typically ordered dinner. The homemade biscuits are my favorite thing here. They are solid, soft, and buttery. I try to get one every time, even if I order breakfast.   The servers are also always very nice. Last night, my active 3 year old wanted to sit at the bar in front of the kitchen. One of the employees ended up letting her help with restocking the coffee creamer. My daughter had a blast!   I recommend!",

They have never messed up my order and I have eaten here at least 5x.  This place is not as fast pace. I think it being away from the strip is the reason why.

    "text": "First meal and review of 2016 and its not a good start. After eating at the westside location and enjoying the sweet cream waffle, the manager there told me to try the chicken fried steak. I love chicken fried steak! My quest in Vegas is to always find a great chicken fried steak, and .... sadly....not many places can do it right.  The chicken fried steak I had here at BBD was not good. Overcooked, small, crunchy, flavorless gravy....nothing good about this one. Won't be ordering that again.  The place was packed, 45 minute wait for a table. As a single I was able to procure a counter space quickly. Service is fast and friendly, food came out fairly quick considering the massive amounts of orders. And maybe that's why the Chicken Fried Steak was lacking, due to heavy volume.   I'll be back because its close, but will not order this again.",

I got the French toast and a side of 1/2 biscuit n gravy. This biscuit was home made and big for being a half size. The gravy was to die for! The French toast was very good :)  he got the pot roast and it was the full size. It was a lot! I mean my husband is a good size man lol. Also we got the Parmesan chips and coffee. All was delicious! I will be going back :)",

But my friend and I are on a healthy eating spree so we decided to get something on the smaller side. He ordered from the fit menu and really enjoyed his meal. I ended up getting the club sandwich on sourdough bread and it came with a choice of a side so, me trying to eat healthy, I chose a salad. For a lunch portion it was still pretty big to me. It was pretty good but nothing amazing. The service was okay. My friend is allergic to avocados and she forgot to modify the order and he had avocados on his plate. Didn't mention anything cause it's not deadly or anything and we don't wanna be those people, but still... I'm sure I'll be back again in the future to try some of their breakfast options.",

It comes with four pieces of fried chicken your choice of mash or fries and a soup or salad (I am a picky eater so I am all about the chicken and fries) It was Great! I have been there twice now and will be a regular as long as they keep the fried chicken on the menu. What would really make it awesome is if they had dinner rolls, that would complete my meal. Everyone is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I enjoy their music selection when I'm eating there, it's different. Comfort food in a comfortable diner with large portions and a friendly staff. I will add two pictures of my visits. Bon appetit",

I believe I can correctly describe the restaurant concept as \"50s diner/mountain lodge/Cracker Barrel ... dosing on massive quality & quantity steroids.\"  The entire breakfast/lunch/dinner menu, with the exception of baked potato, is available during all hours. Breakfast seems to be their long-suit, but it's all good.  The plate I've taken a shining to is the chicken-fried steak dinner. A massive portion, sure to please.   \"The Grizz\" is a $13 breakfast that includes two large oval plates full of food -- eggs, bacon, sausage, ham steak, home fries and pancakes.  A wee bit pricey but again, the quality and portions are there.  You won't be making a mistake in checking this place out, for sure.

Items Ordered:  - Black Bear Burger w/pepper jack cheese ($14.59) - Steak and Eggs ($13.99) - Diet Pepsi ($2.59)  (+) I enjoyed the cheesy and fun decor! I got  kick out of all the bears strewn about the place, the jukebox, the cheesy little signs (ex: Bear feet allowed!) and all that! lol (+) Maybe I got lucky, but our booth was clean and we received excellent and attentive service! From reading other reviews on here I was wondering how it would go and I have to say I was very pleased with the service received here! (+) Generous portion sizes! Much larger portions than I was expecting!  (+) Taking into consideration that this is a chain diner, I thought the food tasted good! The burger was big,fat,and juicy. The steak was nice and thick and tasted pretty good. You can't compare it to some of the steakhouses I've been to lately, but for a diner it is a very good steak!  They have a lot of different items on their menu that I eventually want to try(like their omelettes and other breakfast foods!) so we will be back!

The problem was that they apparently ran out of sauce. Huge fluffy biscuits with almost no gravy, perfect eggs Benedict with almost no Hollandaise, and three giant yummy pancakes (and a little one) with one small tub of syrup and no butter. Swing and a miss.",

Burgers, steaks, sandwiches, etc.  We had the all-you-can-eat fish and chips and a breaded chicken cutlet.   They use Pollock instead of cod for their all you can eat. The first 3 pieces were dry and curled up. The extra 2 were tender and flaky. They didn't look like the same cuts. I should have had the regular version with cod. The fries, slaw and hush puppies were ok.   My wife's chicken was alright. She really liked the side salad.   We passed on dessert.   Total for 2 dinners, no drinks or dessert was about $28 plus tip.   The server was great. Nice personality. Very attentive.   If we get a jones for this type of food, we'll be back. Its worth the price but I was disappointed with most of the fish and thought when I mentioned how bad the first 3 pieces were, she would she not charged me for them.",

We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.  We \"discovered\" the Black Bear Diner accidentally and we are very glad we did. To be clear, this is in the \"Diner\" class of restaurants and as such is terrific.  It started in Shasta California and now is a chain of 80 diners.   It is what it purports to be - a terrific diner and nothing more . . . comfortable seating, great service, good food at very reasonable prices.  The menu is extensive with an incredible array of choices.  The choices are typical of diners - great breakfast selections (pancakes, waffles, eggs, omelets,chicken fried steak, massive biscuits, salads, large burgers, sandwiches, etc.), substantial lunch and dinner choices.  Portions are big and filling.  On this visit, I had a 3 egg omelette and seasoned potatoes with a huge biscuit is big enough for two meals.  My wife had the Shasta Scramble which was equally large.  Tasty and plentiful!  I'm a big eater and I still took home 1/3 of my breakfast.  We have and will continue to go back . . . . and will bring a very healthy appetite with us.",

We ordered the Grizz (ham, sausages, bacon, 3 eggs, 2 pancakes, and side of either potatoes, hash browns, or fruit) and the Corned Beef (corned beef, 2 eggs, 1 pancake, and same side choices). Both were delicious. My favorite thing here are the pancakes - they are so buttery, light, and fluffy. In my opinion, they taste even better than IHOP's original stack. The pancakes here are like sweet pillow clouds that melt in your mouth. Everything else that I tried tastes like your standard breakfasts foods at a diner. But whenever I come here, I feel like I'm eating at Disneyland. The staff are friendly, the music is old school, and the decorations are quaint and whimsical. Even while you're waiting for your food, you can read the faux Bear Diner newspaper. Today, I learned about Henderson-made Titanium on the moon and moon cheese while waiting for our food.",

Even the owner/manager came around and asked us how everything was.  NICE TOUCH!  :)  Was in the area looking to re-locate, and found this little gem of a diner one morning.   I will definitely be back for breakfast again, and can't wait to check it out for lunch and dinner.  Thanks for a great experience Black Bear!",

I was really impressed with my boyfriends chicken fried steak. Good prices. Only didnt get 5 stars due to the service. We had no forks, didnt get offered refills and our server seemed stressed and forgot to bring something I ordered. Was still a pleasant experience, though. Would definitely return.",

We had breakfast and when the huge delicious plates arrived, my guests were all highly impressed and satisfied. What really made this experience special was our server, Jenny. Talk about great service!! Jenny was engaging, sweet, fast, and fun. She truly made our visit memorable. Lastly the GM Ron spent time with us and really made us feel welcome. I highly recommend visiting this new Black Bear Diner!",

Your satisfaction is really important to them. The servers always answer my questions about ingredients and although I am a very picky eater, I have never had to return an order here, unlike many other restaurants.  The decor is unique and fabulous. My husband and I get a real sense of family when we eat here and my husband always comments the food is better than home cooking because it is tasty but we don't have to do the dishes. Love this place and it seems whichever Black Bear Dinner we have been to, the consistency in food and atmosphere is accurate.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed with the service this Christmas Day morning. We arrived to be greeted which was good and when we told the host how many people she said \"it'll be a couple minutes\". Great we thought we will be seated here shortly. We browsed through the little gift shop they have and of course more people continued to come inside. We noticed a family of four that had just walked in immediately was seated. I figured they had written their name down but only until it happened a second time did I say wow what's going on here. I mentioned to the hostess we've been skipped twice now can you write my name down and she apologized and proceeded to write my name down. We then waited again only to have it happen a third time until I told a different hostess we were here first. He wasn't aware of the previous mistakes that were committed which I can understand. It wasn't a complete disaster all I wish is that they would communicate a lot better and have better organization. We left because our experience was already  a disaster and I know all we would've talked about at the table would've been this fiasco. Please communicate better for present and future customers. Merry Christmas!",

No waiter, then he rushed us ordering, not helping with options we considered. The portion size was huge. Hubby got the scrambowl and couldn't eat but half of it, which is unusual. I tried the turkey avocado sandwich with broccoli soup. The soup was terrible but the sandwich was good, took half of it home.  Service was terrible, nice person, but not around. Not sure what was going on, our drinks were empty for a while. I had to ask the cashier for honey for my biscuit and a nice waitress rushing by grabbed some on her way back to her tables. Hubby wants to try this place again. I'd rather not, except many customers checking out said how amazing thier wait staff was. Maybe our table was the odd one out. But with so many other options out there, maybe not this location again.",
