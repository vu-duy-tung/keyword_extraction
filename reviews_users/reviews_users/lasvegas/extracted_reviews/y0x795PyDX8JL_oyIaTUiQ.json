But it was all down hill from there. Our server took over 15 minutes to get to us before we could order our food. Yes, order. Then after that, it too even longer to get our food to our table. When the food did finally get there, well, it was cold. Yes, cold people.  I hope this is just a one time thing, but yeah...be careful if you get the \"sweet old lady\" as your server.",

I arrived a few moments before the rest of my party and figured I would get the table and have a seat, but even after the hostess went and found a table for my group, she refused to seat me once she was told the rest of my party would be here in a few minutes, but followed it up with \"But I do have a table for you\"... Once the rest of my group arrived, she took a good look at the diverse culture standing in front of her and said \"Hold on, I have to find you another table\" and proceeded to walk around the restaurant... Finally she came back and asked us to follow her, all the way through the right of the restaurant into a separate room that seemed to be full of anyone \"of color\"... I know, I know, I thought this was a little far fetched myself, until I decided to walk back through the restaurant to the restroom (which is located completely on the other side) and it wasn't hard to take notice of the fact that there was not a single black person in that entire section of the restaurant!! Needless to say, regardless of how good the food is, my family will not be returning here...",

However, because roaches are nocturnal, to see one in the walkway between my table and the bathroom (baby roach), and then one in the walkway by the back door by our table is way too much! It was just after all 11 am. Isn't that a sign of an infestation? I tried to get somebody's attention but the staff was too busy to stop! We just left. I was extra observant as we left and noticed that the areas under the cooking surfaces were disgusting! This place needs a health inspector and a terminator. I have never said I would not return to a place until today!     Oh- before the \"roach sightings\" I asked our waitress for a fork. She gave me one. It was dirty!  My husband finally gave me his to use...   I never would have written a review about an overworked staff,  that's a management fail. But I had to post about the roach issue!  The food was good, but I cant help but wonder how much of the flavor was added by roach droppings!  I should start using the bathroom BEFORE I consume a restaurants food! Ha ha ha  I'll pass on this place from now on!",

They make their own refried beans, and they were some of the best I've had in Las Vegas. The tortillas seemed homemade. The biscuits and gravy were delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and definitely tasted like they were made from scratch. The bacon was ordered extra crispy, and it was just that. I was impressed with the large menu. I am not a big breakfast eater, but I do love Mexican choices. Their was a great variety from their  South of the Border selections.  The restaurant prides itself on being a \"family restaurant\" which is probably why they played Christian Rock and Christian Hot Adult Contemporary music. Now, I am not really religious, but I wasn't offended. It just seemed a bit odd. It seems strange to have Christian music playing at the family restaurant that also has video poker machines. The worst part about Christian music is not the message, but the fact that it is not good music. I probably would have added an extra star if it weren't for this music.   If you hate Christian music or this quasi-proselytism, then this is not the place for you. If you are able to look past this, then enjoy a great breakfast.",

But, just saying we did not eat any of there lunch or dinner options. Based on the menu though they look like they have a good selection. It has a diner/family restaurant feel. It reminds me of a restaurant back in SC we used to regular. Anyways we had pancakes, country fried steak, etc. and it was very good. Not the best in Vegas (see another one one of my posts), but easily second in my book. Definitely worth a visit if you have not been there. I only have one small complaint and that was the service was a little slow and she tried to deliver my plates to another table. But, they were very busy.

The decor and food (including the booth we set in with the cracked faux leather) is completely antiquated. I had a bad feeling but was hoping we stumbled upon a hidden gem. I ordered the French toast (the reason for us coming here) and the Hubbs ordered the corned beef hash. It took 20 mins or so to receive our food. As it was delivered we noticed immediately that our choices weren't on point. My husbands corned beef was greasy, eggs over cooked and it looked like a child (or someone who didn't belong in the kitchen) buttered and cut his toast. You could literally see a huge thumb print imprinted in the toast! My French toast was OK, nothing special and my turkey sausage was over cooked and had hash browns cooked on to them even though no one ordered hash browns! My husband complained to our server about his meal which he only picked at. She took it back and still charged us for the eggs and potatoes he didn't eat. Rather than cause more confusion we cashed out the check and left not wanting to waste anymore time at this place. Will we ever come back? Absolutely Not...",

The server was polite, just forgetful and not attentive.  Not enough place settings, when I did ask for one when my food arrived, she went and checked on other people and eventually realized I still needed silverware.  My food came out without English muffins and when she brought them out, they were not properly toasted.  The Little Boy Blue, blueberry pancakes came out and it looked like they took Blueberry Jelly and just scooped it on the pancakes.  Very unappealing. The scrambled eggs were rubbery.  The quesadilla was bland.  Overall, like a 1 1/2 star experience.  If I do come back it won't be for a very long time.",

A Vegas staple it's much more wholesome than the other corporate b-fast locations scattered throughout the valley.  Our wonderful server was super friendly and made sure the coffee mugs never ran empty.  I ordered up eggs, bacon, hash browns (extra crispy), sourdough toast.  The mood would see that I would also order a carb laden grilled blueberry muffin.  Breakfast and coffee were up to the BHFR standard.  The muffin.....I recommended everyone try this.

When you walk in you feel like you're in a time warp in a good way, it reminds me of what and old school diner should look like. There is a cake carousel by the hostess station which was tempting but probably not a good idea considering all the calories we were about to consume.  We were seated, out server was awesome can't remember her name, though. We placed our order, I got blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. It took a bit for our food to come out, but that might be because it was packed. However, when our food came out it was tasty so I was happy.  I like this place and plan on coming back.",

Be extra careful ordering takeout, they take your card number (who knows how safe it is) and may or may not actually make your order correctly despite ringing you up and charging you correctly.  I'm not a fan of breakfast foods but they have a lot of diversity here: crepes, eggs, pancakes, waffles, omelets, and skillets galore. Add in lunch and dinner salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, soups, and entrees. They recently added appetizers, also priced surprisingly well: 12 boneless wings for $6, onion rings $4, etc.  Staff is mostly friendly here: they almost seem overstaffed when I go with multiple people behind the counter but only a few taking tables. Waitresses are amazingly sweet and will probably call you some variation of hon or honey throughout your visit.  Meatloaf is surprisingly good, chili tastes canned and gross, salads are surprisingly large and fresh, daily dinner specials are generally a good value.",

Tennesse Fried Steak&eggs- the steak was very mushy. As if i was eating mash potatoes texture. It wasn't medium rare like I asked and was very bland. I had to pretty much drench it with A1 sauce because of how bland it was. Not good at all. 1/5  Egg Benedict- it was okay. 3/5 not the best. Just alright. Not much of a fan of the potatoes below the benedict.   Hashbrown- pretty bland as well, but nothing a little salt cant save. Pretty crunchy and was pretty good to me. 4/5  Pancakes- undercooked, thick and pretty salty. Not good at all. I have a picture to prove how mushy it is. After cutting into it, the pancake just broke up. 1/5 won't even take this in a to go box.   French toast- 4/5 this was pretty good. A little mushy and too much blueberry syrup/jam that it drenched yhe feench toast making it mushy. However, it was pretty decently good.",

He literally was just saying words that didn't work together...I know that because the closed captions were on.  I'm fine with people having their political and religious preferences, but I think forcing that on your customers is totally unprofessional. The blueberry pancakes were not worth the atmosphere.",

Clearly it's a popular spot because it was packed, but since there were only three of us we got a table in about 10 minutes.  They err on the side of giving you a ton of food and charging a lot - there were not many entrees available that weren't going to be ginormous.  Service was friendly but very slow.  Since we didn't know what we wanted the moment we sat down, the server gave us 'a minute'...really she gave us 15 minutes before she came back.  Whoops.  The food was ok, better than Denny's or IHOP but nothing too exciting.  I had french toast and a ham & cheese omelette.  They did have a huge menu and lots of selections.    It's not a bad choice if you want to get away from the strip and have a cheaper meal than you can get there.  But I wouldn't go too far out of your way for it.",

The food is delicious it's like a lil hole in the wall place that reminds me of home cooked meals growing up that my parents and grandma cooked for my sister and brothers and I as kids. The prices aren't that bad and the service most times is good.

They have a more extensive pie flavor selection that they rotate, or you can special order with 24 hours notice.   It was a pretty decent, but standard American diner pie.

Arleen was our waitress--she was fantastic AND entertaining!  We fell in love with her and her saucy attitude.  She took great pride in what they serve at Blueberry Hill.  She made sure we knew that everything was cooked from scratch with real butter--no cans opened there.  We both ordered omelettes and chose 3 pancakes as our side.  The omelettes are made from 4--FOUR--eggs to give you an idea of how large they are.  Those pancakes were some of the best I have EVER had!!!  HUGE, light and fluffy and incredibly tasty.  As other reviews have stated, everything was super sized.  We ended up taking some of our omelette home as well as half of our pancakes.  I admit it; we went back a second time for more pancakes before we left Vegas.  There are lots of items for sale on the menu and I can only speak for our breakfast food and visits.  But I HAD to give Blueberry Hill 5 stars for our incredible Vegas breakfast experiences.",

Just maybe too large of a menu and too many delicious choices!  It seemed when we were there, that most of the others were regulars.  Nice touch to know the neighbors eat there often as well.  Again, that old world charm and feel. The way it used to be.  Maybe.  Pancakes were huge, fluffy and delicious.  The Biscuits and gravy stick to your ribs and you walk away full without the Vegas sticker shock...  Waitress was fast, efficient and informative.  it was my GF's first time and she had many questions.  Again, too many choices for her to settle easily on one!",

The ambiance of the place was very sad and depressing, maybe because there's hardly any patrons dining there?",

I am positive without ever trying anything else on their menu that it is all pretty damn amazing! I would be willing to bet my last ducket on that!

Probably needs to pay for the recent addition of a Christian bookstore. Who really carries cash these days? A bit annoyed and they really should tell people. Almost all the places I eat, include the fee in the menu price.  Food was so so. The Mexican pepper steak was very dry and overdone. Menu says 10 oz of steak in chunks. They bring it out on a sizzling plate which cooks it even more.  It was reduced to probably 3 oz. Waitress was lackluster. I asked for no ice in my Pepsi, of course got ice. I had to ask for the included soup, she didn't offer it. Won't be coming back.",

This is just a straight honest all around review of Blueberry Hill (BbH from here foreword). Don't expect the best and most amazing service, or a bathroom that looks clean or sanitary in anyway. Look forward to big portions, with greasy and artery clogging food to fill you up. Let's not forget to mention the food display. Each day they have a special and put a display out; of like actual food. So don't touch it like I did (thinking it was plastic). That is just the weirdest thing. I have come here and watched servers argue right in front of me over where we were being sat, and because of rotation I WAS ASKED TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT TABLE AFTER BEING SEATED. It is a churn and burn kind of place so you'll be in and out fast. Which is good because you wouldn't want to be around the flies that hover near the display food haha. I've never had dessert here, but the display case is nice. Specifically at the s. Decatur location my friend got food poisoning from a burger, so there's that risk as well. It's cheap. It's breakfast. I'll go to the flamingo location instead though. It's newer and nicer.",

They did not need any butter added to them either. Just a lil syrup here and there. I'm glad I asked for the compote on the side though because I tasted just a little of it and I think I have diabetes now.   My boyfriend ordered the Dixie Meatloaf Breakfast which is the whole reason why we came here for dinner. He loves this. It is really good so I don't blame him!

I ordered 2 eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, biscuit & gravy AND chocolate Oreo pancakes.  Everything was scrumptious but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  Big portions! Perfect for family size or take home. This was my first time.  I usually go to IHOP but I will be returning soon. (My boyfriend left satisfied as well)",

This is where the positive experience ends.  The coffee tastes like dish-water.  (Very similar to say Denny's.)  I drank it because I was in need of caffeine, and wasn't terribly pleased.  I got the chicken and waffles, a couple of eggs, and an order of hashbrowns.  The chicken was grilled, not fried.  (I couldn't tell this from the menu, or I wouldn't have ordered it.)  The waffles were a bit overdone, and crunchy on the outside.  The inside seemed like so much vapor.  They lacked substance.  There was something like cinnamon-sugar dusted on the top of them.  (This seemed really weird to me, and didn't go with the chicken.)  The hash browns were cooked properly, but still seemed to lack flavor overall.  Add to that the fact that I didn't feel terribly great physically shortly after leaving (Indigestion?  I'm not sure.  I felt quesy and flushed.) I just wasn't happy with the experience.",

Service and quality is consistant, no matter if it's a weekday lunch, Sunday brunch (very very packed!) Or midnight coffee and pie (chocolate cream pie with oreo crust, anybody?) Ive always been met with a warm smile and friendly service. If anything is not right, tell them so they can fix it. Dont leave a bad review just because you decided to be grumpy and keep your problems to yourself. Any minor problems we've had were fixed so fast I don't remember what they were, and I've always left happy.   Its also GREAT for kids. This has become our family's go-to spot. Lots of kid's meal options (with a coloring page and crayons of course). And for extra picky eaters and tots, they even have a a la carte menu at the back where you can find things like a single pancake, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, rice and things like that. They've even brought out oyster crackers or saltines for babies who don't want to wait!",

You can tell that theyre made from scratch. dont get them if your on a diet. Second best in my book. I loved that it was served it in a skillet. Really made it cute. Nom, nom nom.  I hear the French that is good, so I will try that next time.  I tried some of my daughter pancakes which were fluffy and light. Delicious.   The eggs and sausage were just okay, nothing special. Asked for cheese on the eggs and they threw a piece of sliced cheese on there that didn't even melt. Yuck.   This place was packed so I suggest coming at brunch time. This place looks really old fashioned and the serves looked very seasoned.  My dad loved that the server his age (40s?) kept calling him honey, babe and sweet thang. Oh gosh, it was hilarious. She was very good at refilling our drinks and coffee. Considering how busy she was, she was great at checking up on us making sure we were happy.",

It is open 24 hours a day, which allows customers many opportunities over the course of the day to get their fix of breakfast goodies.  Highlight of the menu: their French toast is absolutely delectable, it is made with Hawaiian sweet bread, which makes it just melt in your mouth.   The customer service here is always consistent and expected. The waitresses know the menu inside and out and are always ready to re-fill waters, coffees, and take special requests.  Show up early in the day if you are coming on a weekend because it gets busy and the wait can sometimes be overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend this breakfast joint to anyone interested in a quick, easy eating experience that is quality first.",

    "text": "By far, one of the best places I've eaten breakfast in the state of Nevada.   My sister has been living out in Vegas for the past few years and wanted to take me around to a few good eateries. Our first stop on a quiet Friday morning was Blueberry Hill. We showed up a little after 11AM and the crowd seemed sparse. Because of this, our group was taken immediately to a comfy window booth, had our menus handed to us and drink orders taken. Within minutes our coffees and water arrived.. all positives so far.  We were given a couple more minutes (as requested) to look over the menu, which had a LOT going on. The prices were fair, ranging from low eggs and bacon at around $4 to steak and eggs pushing $12. Although the place is called 'Blueberry Hill', I didn't feel the need to try something with blueberries or that sauce in it. I'm a HUGE fan of pancakes, but not at all with the dessert like toppings. Just butter and syrup please.  I'm cool with the basics, so I grabbed the 1-2-3 Biscuit Special; 3 pieces of crispy bacon, over-easy eggs and they generously gave me 2 biscuits and gravy (as opposed to one). For a side to share.. we grabbed 4 pieces of french toast.   ..When the food's good, no one speaks. The head nod is given with a little grin that holds a mouth full of food. This is what was happening and my stomach was truly thankful. I felt all giddy inside.. My body knew it was consuming breakfast up to par with some of the best and was preparing itself for a nap already.   The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. Gravy was warm with bits and pieces of sausage in it and hints of pepper. The biscuits were nice n' fluffly, lightly lathered with butter and had a light crispness around the edges. The French toast was out of this world.. it was almost equivalent to eating donuts.. doughy, buttered and dusted with sugar.. syrup was practically not needed for these things. I have a feeling they were fried somehow.. and I'm not complaining 'bout it one bit! Dip that crispy bacon into egg yolk and let it run for the WIN. (Crowd cheers)  It didn't seem too packed in the customer department at this hour. Perhaps that's the reason we were able to get such prompt and friendly service along with a great meal. Satisfied? Yes.",

My other son had the chicken and dumpling special and he was very happy with his which is why they got 3 stars 1 for service and 2 for the food",

    "text": "Blueberry Hill is an old-school American Diner that looks the part. It literally looks old both inside and out. Worn walls and flooring, neon lighting trimming the walls... I'm sure this place has seen better days one or two decades ago. But, I guess you can say it has character.  What matters most, of course, is the food. It isn't bad. With a menu that rivals the thickness of the one at Cheesecake Factory, it might take a while to figure out what you want. They have just about every comfort dish you'd expect to find at a breakfast, lunch, and dinner spot like this. I typically go with pancakes for my early morning meal, but opted for their strawberry crepes ($10.09). A light and mild cheese blend mixed with a strawberry compote filled three delicate crepes. Sliced strawberries topped the dish. Portions are large but I still managed to devour it.  An even bigger dish was my wife's Denver omelette ($11.09) filled with cheddar cheese, diced ham, onions and green peppers. It was accompanied by some awful hashbrowns, extra crispy bacon, and deliciously spongy french toast.  The size of the kid's chocolate chip pancakes ($5.39) was ridiculous. It consisted of three pancakes that would have been challenging for any adult to finish, let alone a six year old. Chocolate chips were sprinkled on top and worked into the batter and a mound of whipped cream topped it all off. My kid and I enjoyed attacking it and it left him in a sugar high.  Breakfast wasn't cheap. It ended up being about $50 for the three of us. But, it did leave us happy and full.  3.5 Stars",

Our server Emma was the worst, she brought cold coffee, took forever to come and ask us if we needed refills and when we found plastic in our food she didn't bother apologizing. They took the plate to the cook and asked for a remake of the meal and it took almost 25 minutes just to remake a quesadilla! The remake of the meal was of no importance to anyone in the building. The manager was no where to be found because the server kept saying he wasn't available, my sister literally had to go get the manager herself when she saw him walking and even then he never apologized for the service we had or the plastic found in my nieces food. He was quick to just grab the check and tell us to have a good day which seemed like he just wanted us gone so he didn't have to deal with the issues we were bringing to his attention. Definitely not something I wanted to experience my first time at a restaurant but now I know where not to go.",

This was my first time eating here, even though all my friends told me to try them years ago. I must say those frigging pancakes were literally the BEST I've ever tasted by far. In comparison to Dennys/IHOP everything else tasted the same. Cooked to order is the motto when eating at places like this. A bit expensive, but the home cooked taste is well worth it. The specialty type pancakes ($10-$12) come with 4 pieces. Prepare for a doggy bag, these bad boys are huge and filling. They actuall mix the fruit directly into the batter, and then top them off with said fruit. Glad I tried this place, and will recommend it to others. I will be returning here from time to time. 4 stars ONLY because the cook Miguel had a complete attitude with the hostess. He also complained alot over food. I speak and understand Spanish so that's how I know. He was asked to cook my hash browns well, and he asked \"why\" as if he was the one eating it. Dude just cook my food the way I like it and hush up! Your a cook... so cook. Like do nothing but cook sir. Thanks.  Other than that 1 issue, I'm pretty satisfied.",

Oh well. But it took 15 minutes to get our order taken, and it was only because we asked another waitress (Emma, super sweet). After waiting another 15 minutes, our assigned waitress (forgot her name) forgot my sons drink and brought water instead. Oh well. But a couple arrived, had their order taken before ours and got their food before us. We wasted over a half hour for water. Our food was no where in sight and our waitress didn't even bother to come back to our table so we left. Will never come here again. Very poor service.",

And when you call them to complain, they don't want to deal with you and ask you to call Grubhub to settle it. As if there is no accountability for what they do. It's ridiculous especially when knowingly everyone gets screwed. It's unfortunate for the owners, customers, and Grubhub.  Too bad they're waitresses that don't care enough to get the order correct at least once and push their incorrectness on another company when all they had to do is check twice & the notes specifically given.

Reading between the food splotches didn't make it any better.  Definately not a place I would wait for a table to become empty.  NOW SUCH A WONDERFUL WONDERFUL RESTAURANT!  No embarrassment taking friends and guests for a hearty breakfast or quick lunch. ...even that little  dessert for a sweet treat.  I hadn't  been there for several years but this day I was a guest and couldn't say\"no\". I was shocked to see haw wonderful it's become.  The ordinary Blueberry Hill has had a bud makeover.  Take a couple of hours stop in, take a break and see the open venue between the 2 stores!  You'll get a great surprise!  I'll be back again and again! SOON!",

Elderly lady with silver hair and glasses came over. When my coworker tried to explain issue she interrupted him saying buger was already taken off check. Coworker showed her plastic and she responded with Oh. Wen to pay for the drink that we charged for amd manager was complaining about us with another worker. I left. Coworker was slightly behind me and she cont. to complain about us. Take this for what you want. But me and my company will never go there again. So unsafe. Unpleasant Manager. Bad quality.

This morning I ordered via uber eats, as I have done multiple times.  When my order arrived,  I was missing THREE items. I called and had the unfortunate experience of speaking to \"Anna\". Anna was completely disrespectful and dismissive, told me I'd have to take it up with uber eats and hung up on me. I called back in dismay and said \" You hung up on me in midsentence!\" Instead of apologizing or transferring me to someone who actually gave a damn about customer service SHE HUNG UP ON ME AGAIN! I called a third time and no one would answer the phone. I jumped into my car hopping mad. My family and I spend way too much money here to be treated this way.  When I reached the restaurant, I asked to speak to the manager and was told there was no manager on the premises.  No manager on a busy Sunday morning? Yeah right! A young lady named Esme did her best to diffuse the situation, which I told her I appreciated. This Anna even tried to yell at me to my face, which made me finally snap and I did indeed yelled back at her. So disappointing, as my family really does eat here weekly. But I'm not going to pay to be disrespected.  Maybe the other locations have people who actually like their job. Thanks again Esme and Anna and her smirk can f off.",

Someone suggested this place as a locals spot (I didn't go to Vegas to be in the party zone, I went to be in the rest and relaxation zone) and it was better than I'd expected based on the look of the place from the outside.  Suzie was my server, and she was all \"honey\" \"sweetie\" and made me feel as if I were the only person in this place.  She said \"I'm thinking about putting ______ or _____ on special today for x amount\" and I said \"okay, I'll take a look at the menu\"  I ordered a skillet breakfast with a blueberry muffin.  Those potatoes in the skillet were something special, seasoned perfectly, crispy and flavorful, the meat was good, the eggs perfectly cooked as ordered.  My favorite thing?  That blueberry muffin from heaven!!!  It was the best blueberry muffin I've ever had!!  EVER!    Impeccable service, kind people and the food is plentiful.  I took left overs back to my room and had a re-purposed meal the next day!!  Great value!  Oh, and they run the little Christian book store attached; and it's great!

The food was gross and of course they wouldn't refund my money, so I was upset and looked on yelp and I came across the blueberry hill. And I'll have to admit I was a bit taken by surprise that it was a Christian restaurant and the attached book store. But we decided to give it a try. And I ordered the 4 duces with a side of hash browns. And I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the server was very nice and helpful because they have a big menu. The pancakes were fluffy perfect and the bacon was just how I like it, perfectly crisp. For the family on 4 and my 2 year old because he shared we spent about 50. But I was very happy I found this place, it's my new breakfast spot when I'm in Vegas.",

The pie was huge, but I would have to argue that it has anything to really do with coconut in most senses. Some sprinkling on top, but the filling was just custard with no real flavor of what should be coconut. You know they order form elsewhere, there is no way those pies are made there. They would do themselves a favor maybe buying pies from a place that actually knows how to make a coconut pie. That is one of my fav desserts and I will not order another one from there. Other than that the food is great, they just need to up the ante when it coems to deserts.",

    "text": "This is the exact reason why Yelp at times is not a credible resource. You see legitimate users with legitimate reviews frequently get filtered, and you see 4-5 star ratings for restaurants that provide a low quality product.   For years, I kept reading on Yelp that \"Blueberry Hill\" has the \"greatest hand breaded chicken fried steak in all of Las Vegas\". There was nothing True about that statement.  The chicken fried steak was nothing more than the processed precooked version that you get at Costco and Smart N Final. All they do is reheat it and serve. I was very disappointed on account of all the good reviews on yelp about how the steak was a \"real sirloin that was hand battered\".   The side salad was merely lettuce with 1 ring of red onion, served in a beaten up plastic bowl. No tomatoes, no cheese, no croutons...nothing. The Ranch dressing tasted like water mixed with mayonnaise.    The biscuit that came with our steaks tasted like garlic bread.   The corn bread that came with our steak never came out. The server forgot to bring it out. We never got it.   On a positive note. The Buser was very hard working and made up for the poor quality service that the server provided. The server was not rude, but she was very forgetful and never came around one time to check on us. You need to flag down the server to get her attention. The Buser compensated for the lack of service by coming around to refill our coffee and water. The server was usually found sitting at the counter and reading a book.  When I asked the server for Tabasco, she forgot. 10 minutes later I asked her again and she finally got it. When I asked the server for Jam, she forgot. When I asked her for saltine crackers, she forgot. She did bring out the check immediately though before we even touched our food.   In conclusion. The bill came out quicker than the food. The buser was the hardest working guy here. The food was processed and low quality. The prices were pretty high. Yelp has failed us all.",

Finished with more crumbled Oreo cookies sprinkled on top of the pancakes  Blueberry Hill Style Monte Cristo Sandwich - Turkey and ham smothered with Swiss cheese, grilled on our own French toast bread with Strawberry Compote  Red Velvet Cake  Contrary to the opinions of some, as much as I enjoy fine dining I share equal passion for dining experiences many gourmands would consider 'low brow,' particularly at breakfast, and taking this fact into account it was with much enthusiasm that I finally visited locally grown 24/7 staple Blueberry Hill just prior to 6am Saturday morning.  Situated on Decatur and the largest of a handful of locations spanning the city the look and feel of the restaurant can best be summed up as an upscaled Denny's with better coffee alongside a more creative menu and given my early hour of arrival the service was exemplary - an older couple entering just after me the restaurant's only other patrons.  A skeleton crew in the kitchen largely focused on preparing the day's housemade cakes and pastries it was with little delay that decisions were made from the extensive menu and orders placed I chatted with my waitress at length, the longtime veteran of Blueberry Hill keeping coffee filled to the brim and commending my picks while offering suggestions for 'next time' - an occurrence that will be sooner rather than later given the quality of what soon arrived.  Beginning savory and moving to sweet it was with a loaded un-fried Monte Cristo that I began and deferring standard jam with a request for the housemade strawberry compote I'd strongly recommend everyone do the same as the ample sweetness proved a lovely balance to briny ham and smoked turkey...\"balance\" completely ignored by my second selection, the pillow soft pancakes chock-a-block full of crushed cookies and smeared with frosting identical in flavor to the cream-filling, plus whipped cream for garnish.  Sated and heavily caffeinated it was perhaps a bit gluttonous to consider dessert but unable to pass on a rotating cake-case it was with a slice of Red Velvet that I made my departure and waiting until the afternoon to indulge the results were good, if not great, as the cake was moist and rich though I'd have preferred more tang to the icing...a small quibble at $3 for the 11.6oz 'slice.'",

    "text": "One of the more underrated spots to eat, in my opinion. It doesn't have that sexy vibe like some of the specialized restaurants you would find downtown. It's not a hipster hangout. There are no cool and interesting decorations they showcase. The place does not have some sort of specific theme to it. Just a straight-forward, no-nonsense diner-type eating establishment. The waitresses there are older and look as if they don't take any attitude from anyone, yet they are cordial and nice. The food is decent and portions are good. There's not really a gotta-try-this item on their menu. The price is reasonable also. It's great for a small group to go grab a bite to eat or have coffee after being out on the town all night.",

    "text": "What horrible service!  On 07/10/15 was my first anniversary. My husband and I went to eat some brunch at Blueberry Hill close to Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas and we got some of the worst service ever. The server comes up and asks what we want to drink. My husband ordered a coffee; I ordered a coffee and water. The server started to walk away right as my husband asked to have a water added to his order as well. She looked irritated when my husband added a water to his order. Then, it took the server about 10 minutes to return to us to take our order. When we finally got our food, about 30 minutes after walking in, she told my husband that the toast may be a little burnt and to let her know if he wanted her to remake it. On the outside, the toast looked fine, so he kept it. The server then stated, \"okay, just remember that I'm here for you\", winked at us, then left and didn't check on us again. So when my husband lifted the bread, surprise, it was indeed burnt. He toughed-it-out and ate it because we had already decided not leave the server a tip. However, the bus person, named Felipe, was awesome. He actually kept our coffees full and brought us straws for our water; because the server didn't even give us that. My husband gave Felipe a tip in his hand, then we paid the bill, then we left. I asked Humberto Galindo if the server's perception of us \"minorities\" would've changed at all if she knew I'm a 14-year Air Force. However, that's neither here nor there...nobody deserves to be treated like we did. Recommendations: (1) TREAT OTHERS the way you want to be TREATED and (2) DO NOT go to the BLUEBERRY HILL near Charleston and Decatur in Las Vegas, NV.",

We thought it was going to be busier, but it doesn't get that busy around dinner time. We were instantly approached by our waiter, who was in a bit of a mood but we ordered our drinks, and they came out quickly. We decided on what we wanted (Which was difficult since there were so many things we wanted!) and the waiter was quick to get our order ready and going. It took a little while for our food to come out, but there were multiple of us so it was expected.  Once I tried my food, it was nothing like I tasted before, it was so good!  That's the reason why I'm giving this place 5 stars. Very rarely do I go to a place, and find something that I absolutely love the first time trying it. This was one of those places. It was a bit more expensive than we thought it was going to be, but it was worth it. I would definitely go here again, and I recommend others to go here too!",

My friends and I sat at our table for over an hour waiting for our food, just to receive 2/3 or our order wrong, and cold. Not to mention the food is severely over priced for its quality.

    "text": "I love me some Blueberry Hill! This place is unexpectedly delicious and one of my favorite places to grab a huge American diner style breakfast.  Casual and unpretentious, this place is a gathering spot for friends and family. There's something for everyone and they're open 24/hr too! The menu has a nice selection of breakfast, lunch, dinner & desserts to choose from and even offers specials scattered about. There is also no such thing as small portions here - everything is huge! This place is bustling during weekend breakfast hours, but they seem to have a handle on large crowds; they offer prompt service and we never have to wait too long for our food.   They make my favorite pancakes in town! Huge, fluffy and insanely buttery! I thought Du-Par's had the best pancakes in Vegas, but this one is right up there alongside it! The bacon is crispy, plus the eggs are jumbo sized and always cooked to perfection! The only items that I would skip are the crepes and the hash browns (I've had better.)   Blueberry Hill is a reliable neighborhood staple. Ditch IHOP/Denny's and head on over!",

The highlights... Chicken had awesome flavor.  Gravy tasted great  Coffee was great Blueberry pie was amazingly good!  The cons... Chicken was dry..thank god there was gravy The dressing was too moist Cornbread was adequate.   My recommendation... Scout the large menu and choose from homemade items and specials. I think that's the best bet to be pleased here.   I'll be back.",

So we look over the huge menu and everything looks so delicious after about 10 mins off looking i decided to order the Country breakfast which comes with Three eggs, three buttermilk pancakes, three bacon strips or three sausage links or ham steak, I choose the sausage links. I ordered a coffee to go with my meal as well.   Ok so the pancakes were pretty delicious fluffy buttery goodness but how can you mess up pancakes? The eggs were ok nothing fantastic and same with the sausage just average. I felt I could have made made this exact same breakfast myself so that's why I was disappointed.   The service was not very good I ordered coffee never got a refill until I hunted down another waitress to get me a refill. I also witnessed our waitress giving another table even worse service the table had been sat and was never brought there drinks until about 20 mins after being there the waitress comes up to them and says \" oh how about them drinks, what were they again\". The table was not very happy with the service and neither was I and there was no excuse because the place was dead.   I probably wont be returning here again threes nothing real special about their food and the service is terrible. Yes the portions are huge but who wants a huge amount of mediocre food?",

Normally I love ordering the cinnamon swirl pancakes, but for some reason I wanted eggs benedict. So, I decided on the chorizo benedict. Not a very wise choice :( It was tasty, but tasted more like chili & not the chorizo I'm used to eating. Of course I'm used to eating homemade. So needless to say, Blueberry Hills chorizo...not so Mexcellent.  I think I will just go with my gut next time & go with the best pancakes in Vegas ;)",

However, unbeknownst  to those who may know me, Blueberry Hill has been a guilty-pleasure of mine for the past two decades.  For consistency, quality, cleanliness, selection and outstanding value, Blueberry Hill cannot be beat. I relish my Sunday mornings there for my little breakfast retreat. Anyway, my 'go-to' breakfast is the 'Little Boy Blue', a combination of homemade blueberry pancakes w/in-house made compote, 2 eggs, and your choice of meat, all for about $6.  Blueberry hill makes their batters fresh, their fruit compotes and pastries are also made in-house.  The atmosphere is family-oriented, clean, and truly 100% All-American Diner. Although I predominantly frequent the Decatur/Charleston location (ask for Megan), I have been a regular for years at both the GV & E. Flamingo locations as well for the past 20 years.  Take your family, take your friends - if your cholesterol isn't too high, treat yourself to an amazing chicken fried steak, arguably one of the best in the southwest!",

    "text": "Some friends and I went to Blueberry Hill late one night and order a wife variety of entrees (steak dinner, pancakes, breakfast skillet, cheeseburger, and various other items). Everything was very good and so cheap! The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. The pancakes were phenomenal (I had apple cinnamon). The portions were large and the coffee was great, too. Our only complaint was the service. Once we got our food we didn't get visited by our waiter for a very long time.  We needed refills on our drinks and it took forever. We couldn't even flag down our waiter to get help. I recommend going for the food despite the service, but I warn you to be prepared for mediocre service. You may want to order two of your drink (or a carafe) just in case.",

Because blueberry hill has the most amazing breakfast. The first time I visited BHFR I got the french toast, and the BF got the pancakes. Watching him cut those cakes and spread them with butter..I decided to give them a try, and I thought to myself \"I should have got the pancakes\" but hey the french toast was awesome to. The apple chicken sausage was pretty good, I like having the choice of either home fries or hash browns. Because I'm a hash brown kinda chick...Dig!",

    "text": "MMMM expecting greatness, however I was very surprised at the overall experience from this place. We came in here and there were alot of people waiting to sit down (20 min wait) which is usually a good sign. We waited almost exactly 20 min for our table. Our server was Jacelyn. She took our drink order and we were on our way into our Blueberry hill experience. My 5 year old was quick to point out how dirty her silverware was. They must have just missed this batch as there was some black and  brown left over crusted on her knife and fork. We gave Jacely our order as I ordered the strawberry pancakes because the picture on the menu looked fabulous. My girl got the meatlovers skillet, my daughters the strawberry french toast and happy face pancakes. The order took about 13 min to come to our table. That is when the fun began. We gave Jacely our entire order the first time around. She forgot about half of it. Missing eggs, toast, no whipped creame, no ketchup, no powdered sugar. I noticed i had only 3 pancakes when the picture clearly showed 4 and was smothered with strawberry sauce and whipped creame. Mine had non of this. Just a little dribble of sauce and a ice creame scoop of butter. I thought, well maybe they are busy, however this is supposed to be a top line breakfast joint. They should know that weekend business would be extreme so why the mess up. Anyway I ate about half my breakfast before our server came back with the whipped creame, forgot the everything else. Had to tell her again what was missed as she walked away paying attention to other people, no biggie. She returned with no hash browns and no sugar. my daughter wont touch her french toast without powered sugar and again had to ask Jacelyn for the rest of our order. I never got my hash browns and just figured she was real busy and forgot. That wasnt the kicker, the people next too me ordered the same strawberry pancake dish as mine and hers was entirely different. 1 more pancake, tons of strawberry dressing, whipped cream on top as i didnt have any at all as Jacelyn forgot our request. I asked the lady what she had ordered, same as mine, i thought WTF....Jacelyn never came back to check our drinks so at this point i am pretty irritated. Since my breakfast was not that good to begin with, I tried my daughters french toast. she said be careful daddy as there are hard things in my meal. I was like WTF again. I took a bite and instantly bit down on something hard as a rock. I spit it out and my daughters french toast had tons of uncooked rice in her meal. At this point I was like f this place. We got our check and i couldnt leave fast enough. The service was terrible. I thought if this supposed to be top notch breakfast place they must have missed the hiring procedure with Jocelyn as she squeaked by and has a job here. At hash house a go go i am sure she would be fired on the spot as they would not accept the type of service Jacelyn puts out. Didnt want to even deal with the drama of talking to a manager at this point, so my advice dont believe the hype. Find a secluded Dennys as you will get an overall better product than Blueberry Hill Restaurant. VERY DISSAPPOINTED.",

We got right in at 8am on Sunday, which was great because there was 9 of us. One of my nephew's and I had the Short Stack with 3 sausage and I really, really liked it.  The pancakes were fluffy and the sausage were cooked perfect. I still could not finish the Short Stack. The pancakes are so big. My hubby got the Blueberry Pancakes with bacon and scrambled eggs. He loved it, the bacon was crispy and the scrambled eggs were fluffy. There were blueberries inside the pancakes as well as blueberry compote poured over the top. My niece got the Fresh Fruit Crepes and enjoyed them. One of my nephew's got the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. It was all gone before I could ask him how it was. I must have been yummy. My sister got the Waitress Special with Pancakes, which was yummy. The kids ordered Smiley Face Pancakes which come with 2 pancakes and those suckers are big! We should've only ordered one and had them split the 2 pancakes.",

I was never offered a drink but was brought two glasses of tap water with no straws.  When the server, who acted like a monotone robot, did finally come around she asked my girl for her order then just stared at me!   Oook, whatever.  The Mexican omelette and club sandwich took over 25 minutes to get to the table.  Really?!!!   I get they were a little busy but come back and tell us it will be out soon.  The food finally came and it had no flavor whatsoever.  How do you F up a turkey sandwich!  We had to get to go boxes since it took forever and we had to leave.  She brought our check with the boxes and the check had food all over it.   By this time we were both irritated and wanted to leave but that took forever from the two cashiers that don't know how to work the register.   It's a damn credit card, swipe the crap and let's go!   Needless to say, we will never ever come back to this place, it was kind of busy but at least have upbeat staff who act like they appreciate your business and cooks that can put turkey and bacon on bread, not burn the shit out of it!   I'm never ever one to complain but this was ridiculous!",

    "text": "great place.  While i was eating, i totally got the feel of an independent one-and-only family owned restaurant.  Didn't realize there were mutiple locations till writing review on yelp.   Im staying at Bellagio, and folks the food here is horrible.  The room service is skimpy on the food side, high $$$ on the price side, and the menu doesn't offer many selections and is not order friendly, they don't offer a fucking cheeseburger for room service?   Back to blueberry...  So looking for a local place to eat, time for a morning cruise to find a spot.  Driving past about 5-6 Mcdonalds, 3 Jack in the cracks, 4 BK's, some carl's jrs or basically an average of 2 fast food joints per block, my hopes of finding good food is starting to wane.  Alas an IHOP, knowing that i wanted some standard breakfast fare, i momentarily  thought about IHOP till my better judgement passed on ihop garbage.  As the road ahead started to curve gently in the distance, the words BLUEBERRY HILL FAMILY RESTAURANT came over the horizon into my direct line of sight.  They had a menu listing breakfast food specials, the parking lot was nearly full, so i decided this is it.  After being greeted by a beautiful young lady at the counter, i ordered some iced tea and ripped through the menu.  Everything looked good with just about anything you could want any given day.   Huge selections, and though prices aren't cheap they are very fair.   I couldn't decide on steak n eggs or omelette.  I figure id know more about a place if they could cook great eggs and i could just have steak for dinner.    Ordered : Ham omelette w/ choice of buttermilk stack or hash browns w/ toast.  Took the pancakes.  Waiting for my food,  i noticed about 4 generations of women working the place.  From a 8 year old to an elderly lady.  I didn't realize they all may be related till I heard the brunette counter girl call the blonde middle aged lady MOM.  Then i realized they may be the owners when the middle aged lady talk to the elderly woman 'bout business of the place.  They had the little one windexing, dusting and helping out and you just get a real nice vibe from this place.    THE FOOD : Being from san francisco, im used to a \"3-egg\" omelette size.  The size of this omelette would be a 4-egg omelette,  Big thick omelette with nice big cuts of ham, not small diced ham.  This omelette was perfect, not overdone, and just ever so slightly underdone which is how i like it.  The pancakes were great, warm soft and fluffy.  Hearty portion I couldn't finish off the pancakes.  Blueberry on decatur will be on my list of \"will eat places\" in vegas.",

    "text": "SERVICE:  I guess as soon as they know they're not getting a tip out of it, they don't care! Here's my ordering experience: I sat at the bar, servers asked me if I needed help, but as soon as I said I was ordering \" to go\" they all ran and said \"SHE'll be right with you\" whoever that was.... She finally came to take my order 20 minutes later. I got the Rum/coconut/pineapple waffle, then asked for their $6.50 special, it was supposed to be 3 eggs, 3 sausages or bacon, hash browns, and toast or english muffin. Since I don't like sausage or bacon, I asked if I could have pancakes instead.  I've NEVER had a problem substituting sausages for eggs or pancakes, but she hesitated and said \"yea but it'll be regular price not special price, which is $8\".  Fine, not a problem, $1.50 more whatever, \"Can I have the apple pancakes?\"  \"yea that's $2 extra, and you only get 2 not 4\"  That's fine too, then I said, \" with english muffin please\"   \"Oh, no you don't get toast, because you're already getting the pancakes.\" then she turn around and left!  I had to yell above the noise just to get her back, \"UH EXCUSE ME! I thought the pancakes were replacing my sausage/bacon not toast!, PLUS I'm paying $4 extra for them.\"  She didn't respond and reached for an english muffin, and put it in the toaster without even turning toward me!  FOOD: Waffle: the waffle itself has a nice texture, but the toping is wayyyy too sweet and pie-filling-like, and the pineapple is not fresh, it's from a can. not worth the $8.50.  Pancakes: they might as well call these \"cakes\" and not \"pancakes\"! they have absolutely no texture or taste of having been on a griddle, I bet thy baked them! each one is about 3/4 of an inch thick and fluffy/crumbly as hell! If you like your pancake to taste like cake, then this would be your thing, but I prefer my pancakes to be just pancakes. they are also too salty and have too much baking soda which makes them extremely tannic.  Their description also said that there were apples baked into the pancakes topped with fresh apple slices and compote (apple sauce), but there wasn't any of these things: no apple in the plain pancakes, compote was actually a jelly/custardy substance like in a bad apple pie, fresh apple slices were cooked apple chunks.   Hash browns: hash browns are supposed to be crispy, shredded potato, not chopped up, day-old, fettucine!   the 1 English muffin for which I was charged $1 extra: completely burned center with about 1/2 inch edible border.   Whipped cream that topped the pancakes and waffle: out of a can! you'd think that a \"family style\" diner would whip some real cream, but no.   Eggs: plain old scrambled eggs, difficult to screw up.  the only thing that tasted as expected in this meal.",

We waited 20 mintues to have our order taken and waited 62 minutes aftewr that to recieve our food. Do you know how hard it is to have 4 children sit still for that long for food? We had six at our table with 4 eating places and when asked for the other 2 we never recieved it. after passing around a fork between children we finally went to the kitchen ourselves to get the utensils.",

We were a large party, but it felt that everybody that was seated after us got their food before us..that is the only reason why I'm rating it 3 stars. Food was amazing on both occasions! Very large portions that two people can share one plate. I ordered a bacon omelette with chunky potatoes and three blueberry crepes! I totally recommend their compote!! It was my favorite, I have never tried anything like it!! Come check this place out for their food..just be cautious that you might wait a little bit if you're in a large group.",

Overall, nothing of note occurred during our visit. Our server was very sweet, friendly, and took really good care of us.  The food was really good. I had some sort of waffle with lots of whipped cream and ice cream and my boyfriend had a breakfast burrito thing. Also, the restaurant was really clean, which is always a plus. The lady at the front counter was a bit grumpy, but is it even a diner if there isn't at least one grumpy server/cook?   The only reason I even decided to bother reviewing this location was because it is attached to a Christian store and appears to be very religiously-oriented. Because I am a cis-white woman, it wasn't a big deal to me but I could see it being an issue for others and so I wanted to make sure to mention it.",

My food (my friend ordered one pancake) was eggs, bacon and some kind of potato conglomeration that was greasy and nasty.  Like Tater Tots on speed.  I didn't say anything until we went to pay. At that Time, I addressed my complaints to Brandon, the manager, and the waitress ran up to the counter and argued with us. I requested ten dollars off (I never finished my food) the bill but he only took my drink off.  Needless to say, we will never go back there again for the slop they serve.",

The staff wasn't all that great, took us a while to be acknowledged in order to be seated, then they shoved us in the back corner because we asked for a booth. They had several other areas open, but nope, to the back corner we went.   We had to wait an extended amount of time for two additional waters, as there were four of us. We had to wait for two additional sets of utensils. We had to wait for straws.   It was a lot of waiting and for necessities. Example, French Toast was brought to the table but no syrup. So we had to wait until we were seen again to ask for syrup.   Portions are of decent to large sizes. There are certain items that don't match up. If you have ever cooked eggs personally depending on how many eggs used when scrambled you can pretty much get or have an idea of how much should be on the plate.   French Toast comes with \"two large eggs\" bu when the plate arrives, it looks more like one egg than two large eggs.  Speaking of eggs, the eggs were warm not hot.   Coffee was over brewed, therefore really strong. There was no resuscitation after doctoring it up, no amount of sugar and cream was going to help.   All the dishes are flavorful which is a good thing. The establishment is clean and theres ample parking.   Server had no personality and gave the impression that she was bothered.",

    "text": "Breakfast, Breakfast Breakfast. It seems there might be a recurring theme in my life here..I seem to eat breakfast a ton!! Blueberry Hill is a cheap family restaurant/diner experience. It is a semi-popular choice for people to eat food or breakfast at any time of day, as it is open 24 hours.   Ambiance: 3 - The diner look is okay. It's nothing fancy, but it isn't anything really special either. They keep clean for the most part. I feel like they could do something more to take you back to 'that time' when people stopped on road trips to grab a bite to eat from diners!   Service: 3 -  The service that I get is always slower than slow! I'm pretty lenient, too, I've waited almost an hour for food once! Also, there's usually not too many people when I go, so how slow it gets almost doesn't make sense.   Food: 4 - Food isn't gourmet, nor is it perfect. Yet, it's still a point above average!  They have huge portions and giant pancakes! I do like my steak and eggs here better than IHOP! And honestly, any breakfast place is better than Denny's. Also, my boyfriend said he really loved their chicken and waffles: \"They were delicious\". It almost feels like you're on the roadside havin a quick bite to get the job done--if there weren't so many buildings around!   Super early AM? Need some bacon? Well, maybe you should stop by blueberry hill, you breakfast lover, you!",

So, we knocked the crumbs off the table, requested a new place setting for the one with food on the utensils and napkin, and settled in.  I ordered the Chicken and Waffles, it said drenched in honey, but I only found a trickle in the chicken so I had to ask for syrup, but there was plenty of butter. The waffle was good, the chicken was really good.  My Mother got the Huevos Ranchers, and asked for the milder sauce, her eggs were perfect, and she liked the flavor.  My GF got the Ham, and Eggs, with potatoes. She attempted to chisel through the cardboard ham, it was bad enough that the waitress stopped  to ask if it was ok. She whisked it away and brought back a rather decent ham steak.  Suzi the waitress was really good, kept our coffee coming, but she was also brash, which is ok with us, but some people looked very put off.  I came here because I missed the Stuffed French Toast, but it isn't in the menu anymore. The kids menu, and senior menu doesn't start until after breakfast.  The parking is squeezed and awkward around the restaurant, but is attached to the Dollar Store parking which is giant.  I'm really torn between two or three stars, but the level of filth, on the walls, glass, and behind the counter, leaves me feeling I would mislead people if I erred on the 3star side.",

    "text": "Continuing our snow-bird exploration of breakfast restaurants we couldn't pass up a place with so many reviews and so many good ones.  We arrived a bit later than usual and the waiting crowd spoke to the popularity of the place.  Being from a smaller Midwest city, having to wait at all is a bit of a put off, but okay, we aren't there, we are here.  It may be a bit nit-picky, but a couple who came in after us talked to the hostess and then had handshakes and hugs with the manager.  Then they were seated before us in a 4-seat booth by the window. A few minutes later we were escorted to the smallest table in the darkest corner of the restaurant.  It wasn't the worst thing that could have happened but it sure set a negative tone for our Valentines Day breakfast.     The waitress was reasonably prompt for a full and busy restaurant, but the food took a while.  I hold that restaurants know their popularity and should staff and deliver accordingly to accommodate their customers.    I had the Farmers Omelet and my wife had French Toast with scrambled eggs and bacon.  The main entrees, the omelet and French toast were very good.  The hash browns that came with the omelet were over cooked on the outside and virtually uncooked on the inside.  My wife's scrambled eggs were under cooked inside.   Taken altogether it was a good enough breakfast, but not so great as to justify the wait and not worthy of what the large crowds represented.  Since this place appears to be very popular I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that our experience was atypical.  But if you are going there, get there early unless you consider waiting in line part of a normal restaurant experience.",

The service is pleasant, knowledgable and friendly if you're into talking. Try the Blueberry Pancakes, they're AMAZING!!!",

    "text": "With almost 200 reviews written on this place, I feel writing a review for this place is like \"pissing into the wind.\"  Let's make it short and to the point.  This isn't a bad place for lunch or dinner. They have some unique menu ideas, and they give you portions that won't leave you hungry when you're done. One of my favorites is their Meat Loaf Sandwich.  Sounds dull, but it's a great alternative to Hamburgers.  Steer clear of the Mexican food. Though the cooks are hispanic, the Mexican food makes Taco Bell seem like an adventure in exotic eating.   I stopped going here because of their breakfast. I took my wife, Mother in Law, and Aunt here thinking they would be impressed with their breakfast.  It was the biggest disappointment ever.   The quality was sub par. You are better off going to the Omlet House, Egg Works, or the Original Pancake House.   Though the servers are personable, the cooks in the Kitchen have a bad attitude. Potatoes served with the meals were cold, and all of our different  choices were disappointing.  Bottom line. If you're a stoner and it's late, this is a good choice for a dinner like meal.   When it comes to breakfast, go somewhere that specializes in Breakfast, as listed above.",

    "text": "Experience:  my friend and I were a little hungover and looking for a spot to grab some breakfast.  She likes this place, so we stopped in.   Food:  The food was pretty decent.  We got curly fries to start and the order was so big, it filled me right up.  Then my main meal came, but I was too full and got a Togo box...not before I got a few bites in to taste it hot. I ordered the pork chop breakfast. Eggs were cooked perfectly and pork chops were crunchy on the outside and juicy in the middle. Hash browns were ok. They were like fried potato peelings.    Service:  the waitress was ok....she wasn't rude, but not friendly either.  But the manager needs to take a few lessons in customer service. When we left to pay, I approached the counter and the manager and cashier were changing the drawer. Neither one of them acknowledged us standing there. Didn't even look in my direction. I understand being busy counting, but while one was counting, the other could say...we'll be with you in a minute or something. After about 10 minutes of waiting, they finished, and there was no apology for the wait, or thanking for my patience, just her taking my check and saying hello, as if I just walked up.  Anyway, I was not impressed.   Facility: it's ok. Not a dive, but it's an older restaurant and it shows.   Overall review:  I would come back, because the food is good, but definitely not for the service. Hope the manager reads this!!!",

    "text": "Very unique indeed.    We are out in Decatur and found Blueberry Hill Family Farm.  Which was an interesting place to have breakfast.  What kind of bothered me was the parking structure.  Of course it has nothing to do with the restaurant, just not fond of the limited parking.  The restaurant itself seem to be an old pink building that still looks good.  Inside the restaurant had more of an older setting to it.  But it was a nice feeling surrounding it.    Immediately we were greeted and seated at a table.  The menu was already on the table and very handy.  Looking through the menu, it was unique and interesting.  But I'm a sucker for strawberry crepes.  It was during lunch time, so the wait was a bit longer then expected.  But the food did make up for it.  Great tasting and very fulfilling.  Nice staff, a bit slow when busy, but very sufficient.    Overall, this would be a good place if you're looking for something new, in an old fashion restaurant.  If you go through the menu, you'll  find it interesting and yummy.  Pricing seems very decent for this restaurant.  Sure enough we plan to come back and try more of it.",

The restaurant was in a fairly nice section of town. I felt safe locking my bicycle there to a street sign in the middle of the night, so I thought it was very safe. I went inside. The restaurant was quiet, since it was so late, but it was also very clean, and the people working there were all very nice.  I ordered the chicken sausage pigs in a blanket. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD. These are the best pancakes I have ever eaten in my entire life. The chicken sausage is delicious- it's one of my favorite things to buy from Whole Foods, so I'm so happy that they use it here at Blueberry Hill! But these pancakes are killer! They are gigantic and about a half inch thick. Don't be put off by their prices. When they say three pigs in a blanket, they mean three gigantic pancakes. I brought home my leftovers in a box and ate them for three days.  I can't wait to try the rest of their menu. So happy to find an amazing hometown diner here in Las Vegas!",

I had the blueberry pancakes as this place is called \"Blueberry\" Hill. They are so good. They threw a few cold blueberries on top that added a nice kick to the bites of warm pancakes. I got the blueberry topping on the side as sometimes it's gross and too sweet. This one was JUST right. I loved it.   The apple chicken sausage was another thing I had to try based on others' reviews, but I didn't like it. I'd get bacon.

We walked inside and the place had many tables and looked to be remodeled and updated. Nearly all the tables were occupied but we managed to find a spot within 5 minutes.   Decisions.. Decisions:  Bonanza Special: 2 XL eggs, 2 strips of bacon and added 2 sausage links and went with 2 Buttermilk pancakes.  - (My girls order): She thought it was good and expected but the pancake was wonderful! (The other was mine). It only took one small bite for me to realize that the pancake was PERFECT! Homemade from Scratch for decades and made with Tender Loving Care (TLC)!  Sweet Waffle: ..\"made from our homemade waffle batter with four secret ingredients.\" (new recipe).   - We experimented on this one and it wasn't that good. It wasn't super sweet but had a decent flavor. Waffle had a rubbery texture that wasn't appealing. Stick with the pancakes!  Corned Beef Hash Omellete: corned beef hash with tomatoes, onions, green peppers and chunky breakfast potatoes. I also chose to have hashbrowns with white toast to accompany it.  - Shredded corned beef along with all the \"south of the border\" additions made it a Great dish. Not to mention filling.  Service was attentive and helpful, Pancakes were far better than any 'chain diner'  pancake I've ever had, Prices were okay and atmosphere wasn't bad.",

One gives you a certain fruit, one gives you an option.  I was trying to ask her a question about the one and she kept giving me an answer about the other one.  I even pointed to it on my menu but she wouldn't look and just kept on and on like she knew what she was talking about and I didn't.  Even my 3 friends with me were like \"what the heck\".  Either she was new and got confused, or she wasn't new and was just cocky and rude.  Either way she didn't seem very competent.  And I have been a waitress so I have the utmost respect for these women and men.  I know how hard it is and it can get overwhelming and confusing, but that is where a good attitude and concern for the customers comfort comes in and she didn't seem to have much of either of those....We passed up the chance to go there a second time.  The food was ok but I've had better and it didn't over ride the mediocre service..",

It goes without saying that some of the food is lackluster, however, the quality is consistently good, the specials are tasty and usually a great deal (dessert included....yum)Chocolate cake....... Last time in there my server made the comment that dessert was his favorite part and it was fucking hilarious. Breakfast at Blueberry Hill is a consistent 5 star worthy meal as well. crepes, pancakes, skillets, its all great. Go for breakfast and keep going there goddamnit.",

After we checked out of our hotel, we mapped this restaurant, and it was still about 10-15 away from Freemont street (with all the lights).  But, it was worth it!  At first glance, it looks like a throw back to the old fashioned diners.   I think the waitress we had, her name was Stella.  But, she reminded me of \"Flo\" from \"Alice\".  She called everyone \"darling\" or \"young man\".  She was very attentive and always was quick to refill coffee, which we needed! LOL.  Neither one of us ordered pancakes, ironically.  He had a skillet breakfast, and I had Chicken Fried Chicken...both were very good!   Wish would go back for lunch or dinner, as their menu was HUGE!  Well, save it for next time in Vegas...we will be back!  :)",

My grandma and grandpa eat here at least once a week; they take a lot of their food home as leftovers and they have a variety of special requests. Yet, none of this seems to faze the friendly folks at Blueberry Hill (who greet my grandparents by name and know which tables they like, and make sure to seat them there). Every appeal is met with a smile, which I have seen firsthand when I visit the restaurant with my grandparents on trips back home. \r \r It warms my heart every time I walk in this place.

Our waitress, Virginia, was friendly and efficient.  I ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and my husband had Huevos Rancheros.  The portions are so large (and reasonably priced) that I could only get through half of mine, which included tortilla chips smothered with Jack cheese and green verde sauce (spicy and tasty), topped with two eggs, Spanish rice and refried beans.

Our waitress got our order wrong then blamed us. \"No, that's what you ordered.\"  She says this defiantly in front of 7 people who know she's wrong. It also didn't help that she charged us an extra $7 for a side of sausage and bacon when the menu says $1.69.   We also had to request refills on coffee while the rest of the restaurant seemed to be taken care of.  Overall, very negative experience.

She was also on top of her game with clearing dishes, and getting our food right.   The mozzarella sticks were strange looking- beige, not golden brown, and the cheese inside was cold and hard. The waitress took it back and deleted it off of our order.   Nachos- 1 star. The chips were a bit cold and stale. i was not digging it at all.   Vanilla malt shake- 3 star. Was good.   Beef soup- 4 star. Pretty dang good, unexpectedly.   Chill cheese fries - 1 star. Had random brown beans that stood out on it's own as though it was just scattered on top of a chill sauce. The fries were good though.   I shall go back still, to try other items.",

I've gone to Blueberry Hill in the past but didn't remember the food to be this good.  Portions were huge and they even offered kids meals for .99 cents!  Even the kids meals were huge and delicious.  Pancakes are fluffy.  Everything we ordered was good.  There were 8 of us and what I remembered was steak and eggs, pancakes, crepes, omelettes, and chicken fried steak.  We'll definitely come back for sure.  Even had tv's so it was a family friendly place to watch some NFL games.",

    "text": "The food has definitely gone downhill.  It used to be the best. Now it is subpar, and too expensive.  The prices have gone up and the food has not kept with the increase.  This location has recently gone through renovations to make it bigger and open with the Christian book store.  This has definitely taken a toll.  Bigger is not always better. The service is only OK, the last few times we have been there, it's extra slow, and take FOREVER to get a drink refilled.  Obviously not enough workers to customers, too many tables per worker.   On our most recent trip, I ordered the Monte Cristo Sandwich.. It's always SO Delicious.  However, I always ask for no pickles on the side.  Not only did it have pickles, while it was cooked, it had bits of lettuce and cucumber mashed into the bread.  I can't eat those things and they make me physically ill.  The cooks should be more careful on their cooktops.  I pulled the pieces of the offending vegetables off the bread, but the damage was done and I could taste their residue.  The waitress forgot one of our plates.  And it takes FOREVER to get the check.  THEN.. when we went to check out, they suddenly have a FEE for using ANY Credit/Debit card.  ANY.. and it's a PERCENTAGE, NOT a flat fee.   Not cool guys.  Not cool.  The cashier stood there and tried to say ALL businesses are doing it, gas stations, grocery stores, etc.  Nope. NONE of the places I frequent ask for a fee, unless it is UNDER $10.00.  So in addition to the overpriced food, we had to tack on an extra $3.00 for this fee.    You are short changing your already overworked staff, people aren't going to tip the poor servers as well if they have to add an addition amount to the grand total of the bill.  My guess is that they spent WAY too much on renovations and are now trying to get us to pay the price.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll head over to Farmer Boys in the same parking lot.  WAY better food, less money, great service and NO FEEs if we use a credit/debit card.  Bad business if you ask me.  Sorry guys, after 32 years of patronage to BBH, I won't be back.  ESPECIALLY not at this location.  I may try out the others and see if they've gone downhill as well (or if they are charging the fee.)  But that is a pretty unlikely plan at this point.",

And the reviews where much better than the other two. So I ordered . I was pretty amazed at how good the food is . Considering I had it delivered I thought it'd probably not be as good . Boy was I wrong . I'm very happy . I had the eggs Benedict and my kids had the chicken and waffles . I tried a bit of there's and I wasn't to crazy about the idea of savory and sweet . But again pleasantly surprised . Definitely will be my go to for breakfast. Next time I'll try the dine in experience.",

We asked for some more table settings and she just dumped everything at the edge of the table. We  should have gone to IHOP at Rainbow and Spring Mountain they always have a service with a smile. Regarding the food... It's ok.",

The service was nice enough but a bit slow.   The Sausage Skillet was pretty good. The French Toast was great but I hate fake maple syrup. The Eggs and Hash-browns were oily.   The best thing was the Blueberry Muffin with whipped butter but you can get that anywhere.   So sorry, but this location only gets 2 Stars from me. Maybe the others are better.",

The coffee was a mild brew, easy on an empty stomach while reading over the hundred or so number of breakfasts. I asked Suzie, a sweetheart of a waitress, what she recommended for a First-Timer. She swore by the pancakes. Still, I went with a basic spinach and swiss omelet, complementing this with a side of pancakes.  When the food came, I thought the table would tip over from the size of the portions. The omelet practically hung over the edges of the plate, and the \"side\" of pancakes towered like a mountain as whipped butter melted along the surface and down the sides. But every bite revealed a refreshingly airy quality to the food. I was so intimidated at first, but in fact the eggs and batter were whipped up just right so I didn't have to be rolled out to my car.  Oh, and for you and your fogies, there's a discount for peoples 55 and over. Remember that this Sunday when you want to say \"Hey, Dad. You know what? Let's get some pancakes.\"",

Went after church so it was pretty busy with a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly.  Pretty laid back and casual. Food was a but pricey but worth it imo. French toast as bomb, omelet was great and had nice sized ham chunks. Funny we didn't try the pancakes, maybe next time, french toast a better choice at the time. Hash was ok, just different and bland, they use flat slices of potato and parts were hard almost burnt while some was still soft, i guess some people like it that way. I prefer smaller pieces cooked more evenly.  You might have to ask for jelly for your toast, they only gave me 1 strawberry and 1 grape when served, there isn't any on the table. We sat in a 2seater so it felt very cramped to have anything stored anyway. They leave the menus on the table against the wall, coffee cups, sugar etc. Point is the caddy they use made me feel our food was gonna be hanging off the table. But everything barely fit.  Pay on the way out.  I would def return for more french toast or to try the pancakes, but i don't go to breakfast places for dinner entrees, almost never. :) Come here if you want a GOOD food change from ihops and dennys, and have a lil extra to spend. Not bad though 2 of us cost under 30",

    "text": "Okay so its Monday and I was starving when I woke up and I knew I had a long day at work today and I really wanted to get something that was going to stick to my ribs; I live in Aliante but work was taking me to the central part of the town so I decided to head to this  Blueberry Hill.  I miss the one that used to be the base and so I do not go as much as I used to.  I was greeted promptly by a lady named Susie (more about how she saved the day later) and she sat me in a quiet section of the restaurant.  I had came in very early and so there were not many people in the place yet.  What happened next upset me so that I was preparing to walk out.  There were at least four to five female servers  standing around gabbing about their weekend and none of them acknowledged me.  I was there at the table at least for ten minutes and then there was a lady that was sat right behind me and literally right when her tush hit the sea one of those servers went right over and took her order.  I was stunned.  so  I calmly got my stuff together and went up to cash register because in spite of no one asking for my order I was still going to place an order because I enjoy their food. There was a lady named Pam that came to the register (I am going to assume she was the morning manager) and she asked me if everything was OK and I told her no.  She asked why and I told her and she was visibly upset and turned to the four servers who were back in their huddle and asked them why was I not served.  Susie, the server who was in a different section promptly said \"sweetie I will get you served as soon as possible \" sat me down took my order and apologized for All the servers and the lack of respect and customer service that occurred  I so appreciated her and her kindness that I tipped her Before I got my meal. She is a sweet lady from New York and I get the feeling has been a server for years and she can teach the younger generation a thing or two.  I am one of the people that realize serving tables in a restaurant is not easy and I believe in tipping great servers well and Susie is a great server.   Another gentleman that worked in Susie section and bused her tales  named Freddy was also super nice.  I was prepared never to come back to this location but just with those kind gestures it made me change my mind.  Susie saved a customer and I thank her.",

This time our server was Nicki and she couldn't be bothered with us, she was only concerned with an older gentleman whom she was sitting and chatting with pretty much the entire time we were there. My boyfriend and I are not too picky, but today was a huge disappointment. He got a \"steak omelette\" which was actually only hamburger meat (no steak), incredibly bland and cold...I got the double trouble burger which was tasteless and burnt (even the cheese was burnt to a crisp), the onion rings just seemed to be breading filled with grease. The towel the server used to clean the tables smelled like urine, the wait staff and cooks were arguing loudly when we first arrived, and there were quite a few times where the full dining room had no food, no waiters and annoyed patrons.  My boyfriend immediately felt nauseated after eating half of his meal...we will not be returning, and wouldn't recommend this place EVER.",

I was surprised that I got it so quickly due to being there during the Sunday morning breakfast rush.  I wish that I had my camera phone with me that morning so I could have showed you all what this food looked like. You know how when you open a fresh package of Philadelphia cream cheese it is a big luke warm block? That is what was sitting between my two slices of french toast. A giant block of luke warm cream cheese. No flavoring. Nothing. Just the block. The strawberry topping looked decent enough so I dug in thinking that it would taste better than it looked.  The strawberry topping was okay. Sweet and thick. The French Toast itself seemed a bit more like toaster toast but was cooked well. The block of cream cheese tasted just how it looked, a lukewarm block of cream cheese. I ate about half of the meal and couldn't take any more. I got my to-go tray, paid my bill and went on with my day.  How was the rest of my day you ask? After eating nothing else all day my night consisted of Food Poisoning. I lost my thrill and my breakfast at Blueberry Hill.  Food Poisoning, enough said.   .",

I got an omelette that never possibly could have been finished by a single person. Ok, maybe that's not True, but I surely would have felt like vomiting if I had eaten the whole thing. I also have fond memories of the blueberry pancakes and a pecan waffle of some sort. If I recall correctly, I think I really wanted to drink the syrup that came with the pecan waffle. Yes, it was that good. Leave the strip. Go drive way far away to blueberry hill because the time spent eating and the nap required after will kill enough time to keep you from losing all your money at the blackjack table.",

    "text": "Blueberry Hill is a Las Vegas staple and for good reason. Open 24 hours a day, you can always find great food served in giant sized portions. Although there are several locations across the valley, I have always preferred the one on Decatur for two reasons: it was close to my house and I liked the wait staff, especially after stumbling in at 2AM after a night of revelry on the Strip. Although they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, in my opinion it is the breakfast dishes that steal the show.   For those hankering a carb overload, try the Stuffed French Toast or the Butter Cream Waffles. Cream cheese, whipped cream, fresh fruit, powdered sugar....sheer bliss! If you like your breakfast hot and spicy, the Chorizo Omelet will should do nicely. Don't expect any sides with this baby, it's made with 4 eggs and is stuffed to the gills with chorizo, peppers, onions cheese, rice, beans and the kitchen sink if you want.  Although the prices have increased a bit over the past few years, you will be hard pressed to find a place that can match the quality, serving size or quick and efficient service that is found at Blueberry Hill.  FYI - If you are planning on going with the fam or friends on a Sunday morning, get there early or be prepared to wait awhile. And yes, people WILL wait.......",

Three pancakes the size of a plate 3/4\" inch thick each. Figd they can't be good. Boy a bad 2nd day to be low carb. He said they were excellent. So I tried one bite w one drop of syrup.

Huge portions, cheap prices, good food.  What more can you ask for?  Well, I'll tell you.  Service.  The staff at the HILL are great.  Even though the restaurant is huge - you get that truck stop, small diner feel.  The waitresses are friendly, quick to acknowledge you, and never let your cup get empty.    And the bonus?  Every half hour this bell goes off.  Its a reminder for the staff to wash their hands.  COOL!!!",

May I suggest trying it with Swiss or Mozzarella cheese:) Maria is my favorite waitress at this location. open 24 hours and breakfast is served all day!

We were a party of four and had to sit at one of those two chairs on one side and a booth on the other. Not to fond of those. The menu is at the table and there is quite a few options to pick from. I was wanting chicken fried steak and some pancakes. To me these are the best tasting pancakes I've had in awhile. Nice and fluffy with a ton of flavor. Other than that it's just an older dinner with a ton of customers.  I'll be back to order something else in the near future.",

    "text": "During a late night conversation with a friend living in Vegas, I suddenly craved belgian waffles + strawberries when this spot was suggested... I googled the menu out of curiosity, then disappointed my stomach immediately by learning that they have exactly what I want, and don't exist where I live (San Diego, CA).  Alas, a surprise trip to Vegas happened & here I was! Ordered the chicken waffle (\"Six ounces of tender, hand-breaded chicken breast sliced into four pieces and placed atop four wedges of our Belgian waffle\") to satisfy the salt and waffle craving, plus a fruit crepe on the side filled with strawberries... Let me just say this meal made me a happy lady! The crepe came out first, strawberry compote lined with whipped cream inside and out, about the size of a typical tortilla. Sweet, light and on the money; the chicken waffle came soon after. Chicken was tender, juicy, thin battered, fried crispy and served hot over a Belgian waffle so fresh you could smell it before the chicken. A dollop of whipped butter right in the center and... GO! It was so good I didn't even waste time taking pictures, which usually is a priority; ain't nobody got time for that today.   Service was fast and the waitress was sweet and thorough, even with the place packed... We were surprised how quickly everything came out of the kitchen. Hot tea and a to-go tray later, I'm smiling all the way out :) Seriously a great way to start a Sunday before football; I might make it a Vegas habit for me.",

I've eaten here 3x since July and each time it hasn't been very good, I don't know what happened lol the younger waitresses here need to learn how to be good at their jobs, like checking back with the customers come around with refills on beverages. Today the girl was standing behind the counter reading something and it was annoying because she'd take people's orders and it didn't seem she was checking on anyone else either. The biscuits and gravy were dry there was a small amount of gravy with these enormous fat biscuits that looked like rolls, the ratio was off.  My order came with hash browns and I was served a minimal amount was on my plate like none were left to give lol   The previous visit I had a younger waitress than today and she couldn't get my order correct because she didn't write it down lol I wanted eggs over medium and I received runny eggs, disgusting so she took them back and I got fried hard eggs, that wasn't any better was disappointed having rubber like eggs.

Tips of the trade when you visit Blueberry Hill:  -ask for real creamer !! They have it, but shhh~ it's a secret, they keep it in the back - you don't have to worry about coming in here and cursing under your breath about there not being a booth open, BECAUSE ALL SEATS ARE BOOTHS ! **BLESS**  -the food is typical dinner food. You want something fried ? They got you boo~ Want something huge ? Even better ! Need something solid to cure that hangover ? No problem.   On the day we went back and managed to finish all of our food we decided to try our luck at ordering some dessert. The size is huge, but the weight is light. It doesn't weigh you down or put you in a food comma. We cant say for sure but- the quality of the meat is really good- they seem to use healthier options in their cooking.  Great place 24/7. Friendly, talkative servers !!!! Always clean and quiet! The atmosphere is 100% and is the main reason why we love it here so much, we could sit in here with just our coffee for hours. Perfect spot to hang out and kill time while you munch on your chicken and waffles at 3am~",

    "text": "I was told this location just recently finished a renovation. As I walked in I thought this place was really cute. With a little Christian book store on the side that also sold toys and greeting cards. My first reaction of the restaurant  from the hostesses in the front were really nice and welcoming.  We were showed to our table right away, and was asked what beverages we wanted and was told that the menus were at the end of the table.  Our waiter seemed ok, and didn't have that friendly service that I like; service was....Meh.  I ordered a cup of chili with cheddar on top, taco salad, chicken strips with French fries from the kids menu, and some sandwiches ( forgot what they were called).  First I get my chili, took a good amount of spoonful and thought.. mmmm... chili's delicious, maybe everything else will be good too.  I then get my taco salad.  As I start digging into my taco salad, I think \"Oh my gosh, this is super delicious!!\" As I dig more into the middle, I noticed A LOT of oil at the bottom and it was starting to leak through the taco shell and the lettuce is starting to soak it up!!  I tried a bite of everyone's sandwiches which I thought were pretty good! It was the pool of oil that I got with my taco salad and the fact that I had to keep on asking for water! Service definitely means everything to me!",

It was a morning/lunch time arrival. Walking in we saw two cases with cakes. Beautiful cakes indeed. The specials for the afternoon/evening were out and affordable.   We ordered strawberry, banana French toast. Fresh fruit on top and requested the strawberry compote on the side. The French toast was thicker than Texas toast traditionally used and tastey! My husband had ham and eggs. Excellent portions, made to order.  Took pictures of the daily specials and cake cases. Would make this a regular in Vegas.",

This is still a good place to spend money. I would of gave 4 stars. I took a star back only because of the waitress behavior. Good thing that she came correct when it was time to take our orders.",

But the greatest thing was after we were done eating there is a Christian store right there as u walk in . I brought my 5 year old daughter a bible suitable for her age . So if u want great home made breakfast, traditional burgers, home made Mexican food of some kid of Christians gift hurry on down n ask for sherry u will not be disappointed. This location has it going on 2 be honest my cousin has said other locations are not as good . But if u go n visit another location become part of the yelping family n let's know . Don't be just a looker be a doer mahalo and aloha from the great state of Hawaii",

I do think the prices are a bit steep because 4 pieces of bacon is 4.19$ and 2 pieces of french toast is about 11$.   The customer service is phenomenal! Our waitress has been there a while so she knows all the regulars and she treats new customers with the same amount of friendliness.

Thats okay, it was late and they tried to accommodate us the best way they could.   Food - I had the french toast combo with hash-browns. Usually most restaurants dont serve pancakes or french toast with hash browns, they do! My son had the tuna melt, he likes it a lot. However the curly fries were lacking in his opinion. My husband enjoyed his meal too.  Service - our waitresses we had was extremely nice and attentive. However, the food took a long time to be served.   Parking- plenty of space .  The food was good, the waitresses are very sweet and nice, however it gets a 3 star rating. The time from ordering to being served , it brings down the score.  Id still comeback though. A solid three stars for sure!",

They have typical breakfast that's somewhat pricey, but what got my attention was that the portions were huge. If I knew it was this huge, we probably would've ordered to items and shared it with the 4 of us.  My wife ordered the corned beef hash omelette. My oldest son ordered the strawberry pancakes. My youngest son ordered the grilled cheese bacon sandwich with curly fries, and I ordered the Oreo pancakes. The pancakes were diabetes delicious. My wife's omelette was typical, and the grilled cheese bacon sandwich was packed with yummy high cholesterol lol.  The parking is huge and is shared with other establishments. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. They have a huge selection of food items for times of the day. They are opened 24/7.",

If it were for the fact that we were already very hungry, I think we would have probably left. The pancakes were still good, light and fluffy, they just were the same.

The place was pretty dark and empty looking but once inside we found three or four other tables of late night eaters. As a whole this place is kind of a greasy spoon and a bit sticky but that really didn't bother us. I ordered the waffle breakfast with eggs and sausage and the portion was huge. My friend got the same thing only with pancakes instead. We both really liked what we had and seriously loved the butter they used. The service was fine nothing good or bad to say about that and the price was right at $24 for both of our meals and two coffees. Certainly be someplace when a late night breakfast craving hits.",

You walk in and the blonde owner or whoever she is just stands there and stares at you instead of seating you. The wait staff is slow and doesn't check on you during your meal. Then it's time to leave and you stand there while the blonde owner stands around chatting about how someone came to visit the restaurant today instead of ringing you up so you can carry on with your day. Good food, bad service. I guess whether you go or not depends on your tolerance for customer service.",

Even after this I still have to give it 4 stars because they have the best french toast I have ever  had in my life!  I don't even enjoy sweets, but for some reason I wanted french toast and I'm glad I ordered it.    The crust is so crispy and the middle is so soft.

This time it was all about living up to expectations.  I went with my pops and bro.  We stopped by for some grub before dropping me off at work and they continued up to the Bay Area.  I think I over hyped Blueberry Hill to my bro because he wasn't nearly as estatic about the place as I was.  Then again, he ordered meat loaf.  WTF!  Order breakfast at a breakfast place damnit.  Though, I guess he's not much of a breakfast food person.  I, on the other hand, love breakfast food and I ordered the Wild West omelet.  Hm, I think I liked the Combo omelet I ordered last time better. Yet, the Wild West omelet definitely has a purpose.  It filled me up and had reserves for a small snack while I was at work.  I'm still enjoying Blueberry Hill but more testing much be done.",

But this last weekend was so disappointing!  First of all! I hate big menus. I sat there longer than I wanted because of all the damn pages I had to go through. It was like reading a novel. I was so confused on what I should get.  I ordered the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was horrible!!! It tasted like some type of gravy that was made out of pre mixed powder and felt like it was suppose to be used on chicken fried stake instead! It was grainy, too thick, and bland. Hash brown was soggy and chewy. The only thing I liked was the whipped butter that was served with my toast, and that's sad when a condiment is better than rest of the dish.  My boyfriend ordered the classic omelet, and you can tell they use sliced fake cheese because it sticks to the roof of your mouth to the point where I had to use a fork to get it out. Eww! I really hate restauranant cuts corners and uses fake and preserves to cut on their costs.  Maybe I'm just really jaded when it comes to breakfast, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a good plate of food with amazing favors than okay price for plain food. Blueberry Hill just did not deliver for me and I probably will not return to this or any Blueberry Hill.",

I eat them last in big breakfast platters since I fizzle out halfway through.    Except for Blueberry Hill's Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes, I can eat them ALL DAY.  They made me a fan all over again for pancakes!  I felt like a kid again where I couldn't get enough of them!  (However, I get the fresh fruit compote on the side - it's a little over-the-top for breakfast for me, very sweet and a lot of it.)    Their french toast is also excellent.  All of their breakfast is a good standard.  Nothing spectacular in terms of seasoning with their potatoes.    The service is pretty good as well.  I've been once during the day and usually once every other week at 2/3AM.  It rotates between two different servers and they both are personable and attentive.    Once in a while I'll get the Mexican Sampler since a friend of mine suggested it to me.  I highly suggest you get it with chicken because the one time I wavered and tried it with beef I was quite disappointed.  It was greasy and not savory.  With chicken it's pretty decent.  Their marinara sauce served with the chicken parm and meatball sandwiches is a bit bland and boring, and they're very light with it.  I like to get a little extra on the side.  Also, they serve small waters and you have to request if you'd like a larger water, which is a little annoying.  I mean, come on, it's water, it's FREE!  Don't be stingy!",

All the waiters didn't even bothered to ask if I was ready to order they kept walking pass my table and was taking orders for other tables that have been seated way after I was. And even after Laurie told one of the waiters that I was ready to order, the waiter shrugged Laurie off her shoulder and the waiter wasn't doing anything at that moment and the waiter pawned me off to a different one. I even asked for my check early so I can just pay for it already without having to wait, because I had to go to work afterwards. And when I told the waiter she said I couldn't get the check yet. I was really upset with everything here, I will never go to this Blueberry hill again and don't recommend this location to anyone.

When ordering, my friend wanted french toast, which comes with a side of eggs and bacon. She did not want the eggs and asked if there was a way to replace the eggs with something else. They made the request seem so unreasonable. The waitress said she would check with the manager to see if the request could be fulfilled, yet she never got back to us. When the food came out, my friend was able to get another slice of bacon, but the waitress threatened that this was a one time thing, and next time they would have to charge for extra bacon. After all that, we waited patiently for the check, which took forever to receive because our waitress was gossiping with her co-worker.

    "text": "After many rave reviews from family & friends who said the food was great and portions were big, my husband & I visited at about 10 am on Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago. I noticed when we walked in that there was NO atmosphere at all! The place is very beige: beige tile going a third of the way up the walls, beige linoleum, etc.It reminded me a lot of a budget motel dining or banquet room. Very generic and boring. I was expecting a few pictures on the walls of blueberries or some country type pictures with a name like Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant but there were no pictures at all. It was pretty busy. The place was about 85% full. After a couple of minutes, our server came over. Didn't catch her name but she was friendly, upbeat and had a smile on her face. After looking over the big menu, I had decided on two eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. Hubby wanted pancakes too so after learning the short stack is three pancakes, we decided we'd split a stack: two for him and one for me. Hubby also ordered a Denver omelet which came with either hash browns or chunky potatoes (his choice: chunky), and choice of toast (his choice: whole wheat). We both just wanted water to drink.  After a reasonable amount of time our order came. My hash browns, what little there were of them, were SMEARED onto my plate! Not an appetizing display & it was the tiniest amount of hash browns I'd ever been served in a restaurant!  On a brighter note, my sunny side up eggs looked beautiful. The pancakes came with hot maple syrup on the side. After tasting everything, there was some good news but mostly bad news: the hash browns, not surprisingly from the way they looked, tasted terrible! Greasy and the grease tasted OLD! YUCK!! The eggs were cooked perfectly although they had no seasoning on them at all which I easily rectified with the shakers on the table. The pancakes were overcooked. When I cut into them, the top layer separated from the rest and they were chewy. If they'd just been cooked a minute or two less...  Hubby said his omelet was good and it was a decent size. I tried his chunky potatoes which were good, not great, but markedly better than my hash browns. The portion size of his potatoes was small too. His toast was fine.   Our server never came by after we had tried our food to ask how things were.  We had to flag her down to get the check.  We were disappointed in our experience at Blueberry Hill, especially after hearing such great things about it! We might go back one more time to try it again. Maybe they were just having a bad day? If we do, I'll post another review then.",

I was visiting a friend in Vegas and he had no hesitation in choosing a spot to eat.  Upon arriving I was struck by the down-home feel to this restaurant. I ordered the Farm-Fresh Sausage Omelet and a side of 3 pancakes. It goes without saying that these were the 3rd best pancakes I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I say 3rd, because there are better pancakes in this country but I truly believe they have the best ones in Vegas. For insight into who has even better ones check out the rest of my reviews! Overall, a great experience and a wonderful place for recovery. Don't even consider Denny's!",

After being pleasantly seated, we sat and memorized the menu and specials forever.  Even considered walking out.  We wish we had.  Our waiter could not multi-task nor remember a request for longer than six steps.  I asked for lemon for my iced tea three times, and finally got a saucer with three slivers of lemon.  Refills were the same problem.  The lettuce in my salad was (I hope) frozen and thawed as I picked out limp bits and gave up.  The Ranch dressing was watery.  Green beans were undercooked and (horrors) the cook thought that adding red pepper might improve them.  Not.  The last straw was dessert.  After ordering coconut cream pie, it was delivered, eventually, to the table in a styrofoam container.  (I didn't ask for it to go).  After moving it to a leftover saucer and taking two bites that were iffy, I noticed what looked like smears of blood on the side.  Gag.  I got up and took it to the counter looking for a manager.  There I was told it was leftover strawberry filling from the cake.  I refused a second piece.  The waiter showed up, apparently annoyed, to ask about the pie and explain that he'd used a knife that was previously used for the cake.  After I remarked that that \"was clean\"? he offered to cut another with a clean knife.  Was this something I should have requested beforehand?  \"I'd  like a piece of pie cut with a clean knife served on a dessert plate.\"  Uh, no.  We won't go back.",

    "text": "Have you ever wondered if IHOP was ever a quality restaurant? Ever imagine that the original Denny's was a gem of a diner with food made from scratch and a loyal list of regulars who swear by the restaurant? Well please wonder no more and just please stop caring because both of those restaurant are garbage and if they were ever good they still wouldn't match up to Blueberry Hill.  I got tipped off to this restaurant when I showed up 3hrs early at Simon's highly overpriced brunch and needed food immediatly! The valet at Palms Place told me to check out Blueberry Hill and off I went. Starting out the place looks like a typical diner, old lady waitresses, poorly dressed slobs and maybe some folks that just got out of church. The thing is the menu is done very well and is full of imagination. I was torn between three choices, chicken and waffles, apple chicken sausage and waffles or chicken sweet potato waffles. I went with my servers recommendation and chose the apple chicken sausage waffle and a side of eggs.  The food in a word: fantastic! They use Aidells sausage which is typically $7 a pack at the grocery store and a strong sign they are shooting for quality instead of using bullshit like most places (ie. Dennys/IHOP). The waffles topped with little cinnamon and accompanied with an excellent sweet whipped butter was great. The sausage was excellent and perfectly matched the waffle. The eggs while simply scrambled and served on a plate were also very solid, they chose to cook them in butter adding an extra kick that stepped up the eggs from typical diner expectations. The meal was $10.50, $7.99 for the waffle and 1.87 for the eggs and was a great value. I had to tip her 50% simply because it was a better breakfast than almost anywhere in Vegas.  4/5 stars because service is warm but overall ok and the decor is very early 80's pastel which kind of pissed me off.",

Better than Original pancakes and IHOPS are not even in their league.  Omelette was huge easily enough for two; good but not the best.  Hashbrowns were so so. Parmesan chicken was crisp on the outside, tender and moist on the inside with incredible lemon sauce - sounds weird but was amazing. The meatloaf spaghetti style was great and again easily enough for 2.  Salad was very crisp, fresh and tasty - enough for 2. Soups are excellent. We had  a fresh vegetable medley which was cooked on the crisp side, the way I prefer, and very nicely flavored.  Husband loved the carrot cake, I've had better.  The blueberry pie was the best I've tried. These dinners were from the $7.77 special menus beverage, soup/salad and dessert. Yes that's right! Husband and I kept asking how they could provide this? Had 3 waitresses and all were terrific!  Their pecan pancakes- not on menu -are worth the trip to Vegas!",

My chorizo \"omelet\" came out as more of a scramble, and only tasted \"OK\".  If you're looking for a local, family-owned alternative to IHOP that's still open 24 hours, this is your place.  It's a strange little restaurant, layout-wise, but on the plus side, they do have booths for odd numbered groups of 3, 5, etc...  The service was honestly just bad.  We rotated between 2 different waiters, and neither of them really paid us much attention.  To top off the misery, the guy at the cash register was one of the most pessimistic people I've encountered.  When my friend's credit card wouldn't swipe on the first try, he grumbled, \"At lest you *have* credit... Most people in the country don't!\"  Nice...  Blueberry Hill will serve in a pinch, but there have got to be better local 24 hour food options in Vegas...",

Im not use to eating a lot of fried food and I ordered a skillet but I was not expecting it to be grease filled. There was not much of a taste outside of the taste of the oil used to cook the skillet with. My wheat toast came with a ice cream scoop of butter in between the slices of toast that quockly melted and saturated the toast. I would have like to apply my own instead of having a large amount applied. Not everyone can consume such large amounts of butter or margarine which ever was used. I told the waitress that I could not eat my food due to the high content of oil. She offered to order something else bit I was already nauseous from the pan of oil served that I was not going to take a chance on them bringing me something that would finish the job.So I opted out and did nit order anything. There were no compensation and I did not touch my toast and took one bite of my skillet before the nausea set in. I was told that I had tonpay for my meal since I ordered it. I paid for a meal that I could not eat. They need better understanding of customer service you cant assume everyone likes to eat grease or wants their toast saturated on butter.",

The country potatoes were alright, not great. The burrito itself had ok flavor, but being that it was pretty big and literally coated it sauce, I had to eat it with fork and knife. I was just really not psyched about it. I wish I had ordered something else.   One of the off putting things for me was the menu. As another review mentioned, he thought Cheesecake Factory was bad, but wow this place has too big of a menu. I hate when restaurants throw every possible option in the world at you. It makes it very difficult to make decisions, it puts more stress on the kitchen, and instead of deciding between a handful of great options like Babystacks, I was choosing between Mexican style breakfast or not haha it was overwhelming. I prefer a restaurant to put out what it does best. Keeps it simple, keeps the food good.   The prices also were good but not great. If it was cheaper I would have been less upset with my meal. My girlfriends pancake special though was a good deal, 7.99 for pancakes and sausage and eggs. Wish I had done that!   Overall just not very impressed. Maybe will be back, but only if I get tired of other places.",

A gal at CVS (thank you!) told me about Blueberry Hill, and it was the best suggestion I'd had in ages!  The service was top notch, the food top notch. My only semi-complaint was that I only wanted about half the serving size, that they didn't offer. But it was so good, I just had to indulge anyway!  The entire staff was friendly. I actually asked for their business card so that I could do this Yelp review. Yes, I liked it that well!  Restaurants vary on the quality/flavor of sausage gravy and biscuits. Blueberry Hill did not disappoint (I ordered the eggs, sausage and biscuit with sausage gravy). Even the coffee was good, and never hit bottom!",

(With a little help) I forget what my mom got, but she was very happy with hers too. Plus the bill was under $40. And they had hazelnut creamer,which made us both happy.  We were sat pretty fast, faster than we expected since the place was busy. The wait staff was slammed but nice, they seemed to run like a well oiled machine. Our food came quicly too.  We did see lots of the tables ordering the hot chocolate. Piled up with whip cream and topped with a cookie. So, it seems like that's a thing to order. They also had homemade cakes and fudge, which we didn't try, but all looked good.   Afterwards we drove to Red Rock Canyon, which was a nice break for our feet, and so beautiful. Definitely made our Sunday.",

Besides being very friendly with my 7 month old baby, we rarely saw her and she didn't even refill my mom's coffee yet the table next to us had 5 refills. The portions are overly proportioned and very worth the price you pay. I had the strawberry pancakes which was more like a tower of pancakes and strawberries. I didn't even eat half of it. It didn't really taste good, it was bland. I'd return to IHOP for my pancake fix in the future. The kids menu has great options to satisfy any needy or picky kid. Beware of the menu for adults.

I'm all about giving equal opportunity to people but when you can't remember someone's toast, give me burnt coffee, forget the half n half, messed my order up and got cold food.  The servers are just bitter people, when I asked another server for half n half since the woman couldn't remember the first thing I asked after I got coffee, and she just seemed annoyed with the question. I won't come here anymore or tell anyone to come here.  Gave them a chance to redeem themselves after the first time I got horrible service.  Don't waste your money, it's expensive with horrible service and mediocre food. My eggs were cold as soon as I got them.",

The hash Browns and bacon were crispy just like i ordered them and my waffle was perfect,  crispy outside  but creamy on the inside,  my daughter had biscuits and gravy  it was delicious  I kept \"reaching\"  over to hers,  biscuits are fluffy but dense and gravy had chunks of sausage in it   our waitress was awesome and I will go back for sure to try their daily lunch specials!!",

Just looked and went back to their conversation because they couldn't be bothered ! I was seated and I wasn't in the mood to eat a large portion breakfast so I ordered off the kids menu the waitress attempted to tell me that basically I couldn't do that because I need to be 12 or under !! I looked at her and said I have never been told I can't order off a kids menu ever anywhere !! She said she would do it this one time lol !! Like , where do they tell you what you can order ?! !? My waitress was to busy yapping with the customers table across from me then anything ! On the way out was the kicker ! This is for you Karen you need to be careful when your talking mess about a customer that's right in front of your face ! I caught your dirty look and roll of eyes when I asked you for a receipt and a bag for my left overs ! As this lady was to busy eating her muffin at the front desk to be botherd to provide proper customer service !! Haven't you ever been told its not a good look to eat in front of customers ?? Thats not even the worst of my experience but rather her disgusting attitude and thinking customers are dumb not to catch your dirty looks and crap talking ! Get another job lady because , you clearly do not belong in the front of the house dealing with customers maybe join the dish washer in the back as I am sure he could use a helping hand !",

She suggested that she order off the kids menu which was made with only two eggs and still comes with 2 large pancakes. My husband ordered two eggs bacon, potatoes and toast. All of the food was very tasty and very good. The wait for the food was a little long but given that they make everything from scratch it's expected. My coffee cup never reach the bottom which was nice, so I was always getting served hot coffee. I would come back to try there dinner next time I am in town.",

    "text": "This is a Classic American restaurant Big wholesome meals with Rock n Roll music  The menu is massive with good images to understand what you will be getting.  We tried the Fried Chicken and Big Shake - It was spot on 5/5 no question high quality chicken and the Vanilla Shake was just right.  Only concern was the service, it was slow, we had to wait for more than 20 mins to get our food. The Kitchen probably was backed up - but when the food came out, it was outstanding. That is the only reason loss of one star.   Will be back for sure.  Thank you",

They are cool places just not considered a real diner to me!.i stumbled across blueberry hill while going to the 99 cent store and decided to have some lunch. Place is clean, they had a great selection on the menu plus specials. Waitress was rude and a lil ghetto but she got my order right, even though she left all the coffee cups on the table then try to charge my wife and i for coffee we didnt have. All and all i t was descent so this wasnt my last. Fast forward 10 plus times ive been here, they changed the menu.well should i say condensed it down and took away items that i loved. Food is good , but i feel like cutting the menu down in size makes me feel like im at denny's(school cafeteria). All and all its a step up from dennys and ihop. It is not amazing. Ive been to different locations and they each have their own feel and faults.",

    "text": "The Bagel Cafe has been our favorite way off the strip breakfast for the past few years but on our last trip to Vegas we tried something different.  Blueberry Hill impressed me with their broad menu and lots of home cooked or locally sourced ingredients.  When you first walk in and see the 18 inch tall frosted towers of cake and pie goodness you might not be thinking about the care taken in procuring ingredients but they do get breads from a local bakery and make a lot of their own components on site.  I had a chicken parm sandwich and loved it.  On a second visit we had a table of 8 and Stephanie was there again with wonderful service and an engaging personality.  Everybody enjoyed their food and my parents still talk about how much they enjoyed it even though they had to taxi out from the strip.  I don't have a ton of detailed information about particular menu items but we'll be back and learn more as we go.",

I had the waffles and it was cooked well. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service here was excellent and I want to make a shoutout to our server, Susie who was so friendly and attentive!!  She even gave us a blueberry muffin to go with our meal but unfortunately we were too full to eat it there (the food here is really good!). If I'm ever back in Vegas, I will definitely come back or at least recommend this place to others.",

When we were leaving we saw the manager on the way out and talked to him about the plastic.  He's answer for the plastic is that we were ok so there was nothing for him to worry about it. Never apologized for the plastic or offered to remove the item from the bill.  Paid the bill and left but will not return due to poor Management.",

The steak I received was well done. It wasn't bad, but not what I asked for. The water tasted like tap water. The sour dough toast on the other hand was very good. The hash browns is what made me take off one of the stars. It was overcooked. It had a chip texture almost. I couldn't finish the hash browns and I usually love hash browns.   Service was great!

There are plenty of choices for breakfast and the portions are fairly large. Besides breakfast they also have lunch, dinner, and desserts. I've only ever had breakfast there but I'm sure the other food is just as delicious. Everything is made to your liking and there is a ton of seating. The restaurant is huge.   The only real drawback is that it can get crazy busy depending on the day and time that you go. There is a pretty big parking lot and the staff moves quickly so the wait isn't terrible.   The prices vary but overall are decent and fair for the food that you get. I only wish there was one near me so I can go whenever I want.",

As for the food. Disgusting. For the amount of money you pay it's pitiful. The eggs always come in soggy gross chunks, and they size down everything. I've delivered food for them multiple times and every time it's more disappointing. You could honestly go anywhere else and get better service,prices,and food. IHOP is right down the street just saying.",

The rest of my breakfast of the standard bacon, eggs & potatoes were also good, but the pancakes were so good. I'm not even a huge pancake lover, but these were fluffy and creamy, fresh and hot. I wish I could have had more, but could barely get through a portion of the short stack (3). Service was slow, our waitress was very forgetful. The busser was great though. Coffee was also good. For a greasy spoon type of diner, this is a great place to go. They had all kinds of pies and cakes they bake there in a case that looked pretty good and fancy too. I will definitely be back. I hope all their locations are just as good.",

The menu here is huge!  There is something for everyone here.  There are breakfast,  lunch and dinner items plus dessert.   I ordered the spinach cheese omelet with French toast and coffee,  my other half ordered spaghetti and meatballs.     I really enjoyed my omelet.   It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of spinach and cheese.   The French toast was a delight.   The maple syrup is served warm and made the French toast even more delectable.    Coffee was great with a variety of creamers to use.    The bf's spaghetti and meatballs was the right portion size.   His meal also came with a drink and dessert.   We got a slice of cherry pie to go since we were both full and when we ate it later it was a party in our mouths.    I am most coming back here next time I am in LV.",

My toast must not have been hot because my butter wasn't melted on it. We paid for a side of sausage that wasn't included. The crepes were VERY skimpy on the four cheese blend and powdered sugar and where was my compost on the side. Eggs usually have a flavor. But yours did not. We have eaten at your resturant in person and did not have any problems at all with the food or the service. It is just sad as hell that the level of our meal fell very short when compared to the meal that we had in your same resturant not even 4 days ago. Just because I can't send my food back you think you don't have to care about the food you fix for a delivery service. It is just sad. We always like to try local eateries over big brand. But today had me wishing I got Ihop delivered instead. Yeah I got refunded half. Technically it was a credit from door dash. But the quality of your food falls squarely on your shoulders. If i had recieved cold food that is prepared properly this review would have been singing your praises but since it is not. Shame on you.",

I first step foot in a Blueberry Hill about 15+ years ago.  Before this week, it's been over 5 years since I dined here. Why so long between visits?  Well, it's because the wait is usually long and there's so much more breakfast options out here.  If you don't know me by now, then that's your bad.  If you do, then you know that I love eating breakfast type food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I would eat steak & eggs 6 times a day if I could. Obviously, I recently dined here for breakfast.  Obviously, I had some form of steak and eggs.  I had their Steak Omelet, which is 6 oz. of steak, 4 eggs, and a cup of cheese.  Hash browns and pancakes is also included.  Price is perfect at around $15.  My meal was very satisfying and most importantly, filled me up for the next couple of hours.  Am I a fan?  I use to be.  There's just a lot more options out here than there was 15 years ago.  Besides, Blueberry Hill doesn't need my Yelp review to boost their sales.  The lines are still long and the restaurant is still packed.    TIP -Night Owls have it good with their late night specials for only $6.95.   -The Patty Melt was my go-to back in the day -Check your bill.  They still add your check via calculator.  You're one fat finger away from being overcharged.",

I had the waitress special with over easy eggs, bacon, and strawberry compote on my waffle. It was amazing. The compote was warm and had plenty of syrup. The whipped cream was a nice touch. Waffle was cooked perfectly, though the bacon was a little inconsistent and I had one overly crispy piece. Overall, the food was damn good. It is a bit out of the way and we don't typically eat breakfast out, but if we find ourselves in need of a breakfast spot again we'll definitely be back! The portions are generous and it would be a good place to start the day when showing family around town because you won't need to eat for a while.",

Everything was fine, but in my opinion, it was expensive for breakfast. $30+ for 2 people. Breakfasts diners here in Las Vegas don't differ too much from place to place.  This place was expensive relative to the other 50 places that I've been to since I've lived here. That's all.",

I thought iHop or Kimmie's Coffee Cup breakfast joints were good, but noo.. not compare to this family owned restaurant. It's like the same reasonable price as Norm's breakfast, but these pancakes, you can tell it's freshly made and so sweet. I didn't need the syrup at all, because the blueberries on top was just that delicious and it's the sauce for my pancakes. These pancakes are almost like an inch per pancake. Good thing I didn't order 4 pancakes, I would've been in a good coma for days. I am usually a big eater and I have an athletes metabolism, but nooo.. this breakfast can just fill you up less than $11, minus the soda and taxes. I would definitely come back here again when I visit Vegas soon. They serve all types of food, Italian food, Mexican food, hamburgers, breakfast, and similar like Marie Calendars type of cakes and pies. Try this place out!!!",

Well........it kinda reminds me of a Yum Yum Tree, Denny's, The Original Pancake House, Zippy's.......all rolled up into one!  Apparently Blueberry Hill Family Restaurant has been around since 1966, but they have been serving the Las Vegas area since 1987!  They have 4 restaurants within Las Vegas area, and I chose to take my friends to the restaurant on Decatur Blvd., as it was just across the street from the U.S. Post Office (I had to mail some stuff out), and because it was not too far from the downtown Las Vegas hotels.  As we walked into this restaurant, it was packed! Lucky for us, we were able to get seated right away.   Upon scanning the menu, I ended up picking the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" ($12.59) -  which consisted of Half-Pound of 100% Certified Angus Beef topped with two slices of thick bacon smothered in cheddar cheese. Meal is served with 2 large eggs (anyway you want it), hashbrowns, & toast or a muffin. You may substitue 3 pancakes instead of toast & hashbrowns. I took my meal with the pancakes, cuz I just love pancakes! And of course I had to have my coffee too!  One of my friends also picked the \"Grubsteaker Breakfast\" , but he took the hashbrowns & toast. He also ordered an - Arnold Palmer. When he ordered that, I had to ask........what da hell is an \"Arnold Palmer?\" Basically it's pineapple juice & lemonade......  My other friend took the Very Berry French Toast - which was French Toast topped with stawberry & whipped cream. He also drank a vanilla milk shake.........after he had drank & eaten all of that..........he told me he had diabetes! Lol! Can we say \"Sugar Overload?\" Lol!  What can I say about my meal?  Love it! A great hearty breakfast! Loved the fluffy eggs........bummed that they didn't have shoyu, but yeah.........we not in Hawaii, we on da mainland! The hamburger steak thing was ono, & meaty! The thick bacon topped with the gooiest of cheddar cheese..........how can you go wrong? Everything taste better with BACON! Lol!  Service was Excellent! I forgot to get our server's name, but she was friendly, fast, & efficient!  What away to top off my quick trip to Las Vegas..........after eating my hearty breakfast, lunch was not needed...........  I would be more than happy to come back here again for breakfast! I just love this place!",

Our server xena  or Nina didn't smile at us once didn't write our orders down correctly, brought us salads that were a third the size they normally are, didn't check on us during our entre, I asked for no mushrooms and had to pick them out of my food, she walked by and dropped the receipt not saying anything before offering desert although our meals came with desert as a part of the special, then when we were ready to order desert was kind of rude. She was a lot more polite to other tables next to us for some reason even tho we smiled didn't complain about her mistakes and said thank you a bunch. It felt like she looked at us judges us thinking we weren't going to tip and treated us like she wasn't going to get a tip, I usually leave 20% tips wherever I go but I left less than 10% because the service was lacking.  I am a server and if I served the way she did today I'd be reprimanded by my supervisors. I'll visit again but will definitely asks not to be in her section.",

I visited this location again and order the same identical item, it was so greasy that I did not even need it. I will say the manager, Juan, Took care of it immediately and took it off my check. Be sure you always tell the manager so they know what's going on and they don't continue to let the chef serve the substandard dish.",

I also like them because they have a pretty good size selection of items to pick from for dinner/lunch/breakfast. Also their desserts are amazing as well, kind of what they are known for. I do want to go again to try more of their menus items and they are not shy on the portions either. They make sure you go home full and happy. I have had a few of their items, such as their Italian Meatloaf, Regular Meatloaf, Taco Salad, just to name some and I have not been unhappy with either they are all very good and tasty as well. I would like to go back and take more people with me, they seem like they are great for bigger parties as well. I would also recommend even when your full to bring some dessert home I have gotten some of their cakes and they area great.",

There are no words to explain how truly perfect they are.  All breakfast items are big servings and I have never been disappointed.  Love that they have vanilla creamer for coffee, just ask for it.

We were hungry which we are aware of waiting time in any restaurant but it was ridiculous. We had to wait on someone just to even say hi or to offer a drink. The serves kept looking at us but ignoring us and kept checking on the other tables which I found a bit offensive. I'm not sure if we were ignored because we look young or because how we were just dressed very casual but don't judge, never know what we have in our pockets because money and tips were not an issue to us. At the time we ordered food they forgot one of our orders and brought almost when we were done eating which at that time it was pointless. I was so unhappy my husband too we could've gone somewhere else. But we do appreciate the guy that was taking care of the cakes he came to us noticed us and noticed how we were waiting and he gave us free complimentary dessert. Thank you! Sorry we didn't catch your name but we did appreciate that very much! He made it a bit better for us as we were checking out.",

The biscuits are huge and the eggs are cooked perfect each time.

    "text": "This was our first visit. Having been New Years Day, many local places weren't open, and we didn't want to go to a chain breakfast place (ala IHOP, etc). We liked seeing a few people go in and seem to know each other as well as the staff. Regulars are always a nice sign for me!  The place is clean and basic diner feel. Nothing to the blueberry hill...I thought it would have blueberries or be more 50's like the song. Still clean and next to taste of food,  that's important when I eat out!  My husband had some kind of rancheros type thing I forgot the name in Spanish. It was scrambled eggs with tortilla chips in them served with beans, rice, etc. He said it was okay, and didn't care for the tortilla chips cooked in the eggs. The salsa they served on the side was very fresh, flavorful and delicious.  I had the crepes with a cheese type apple compote inside and whipped cream on top. It was so delicious!!!! Our portions were very large and neither of us could finish them.   Service was pleasant and not too pushy. I'm more of the European mindset of being left alone between receiving items and dislike when servers come over every 5 minutes. They should keep an eye on you, but not keep coming over to interrupt if you're having a lively conversation and it's obvious we don't need anything (like some places I've been to)...this one was really casual with just the right amount of service.  My only suggestion is that they make gluten free pancakes too. They advertise it's made from scratch so it's easy to substitute wheat flour with rice flour and a couple other tweaks. That's the only personal downside, however the waitress suggested I send in some recipes and write the owners. I think I will as this would be a nice place to become a regular patron of.    BTW - they are open 24 hours and their daily specials look pretty good! I'll try lunch or dinner there sometime!",

The last time I stopped in was about 10 years ago and it was probably good then, I just dont remember.    Anyhew, as soon as we get close , I can tell the parking lot is packed.  I figure if its too long of a wait I can always go back to my normal spot.  As soon as we walk in we are greeted and sat immediatly-not bad for a packed place.  Our server was Jennifer and she was wonderful.  Super attentive and nice.  Our coffee and waters were brought out pretty quickly and Jennifer even offered flavored creamers that wernt stored in the caddies on the tables.   As for breakfast, I ordered pretty much the standard, two eggs over medium, bacon and hashbrowns w/ sourdough toast.  My friend ordered a huge ham and cheese omelet with sourdough toast and the biggest side of buttermilk pancakes ever.  My goodness, they were like an inch thick each and there was three of them.  Sourdough toast was of good quality ( nothing worse than cheap bread) and my god--- why was the coffee so good?  Its probably some generic bulk coffee they buy but it was delicious!  My only beef of the whole meal would probably be the hashbrowns.  I had what would be equal to a 1/2 of cup worth that was spread out onto my plate.  A little less stingy on those would have been great but lets face it, I probably wouldnt have finished them anyways!  Overall, service was great, food was good and pricing was fair!",

She ordered the enchiladas my daughter ordered spaghetti and we shared chicken fajitas. our server was amazing as usual. When the food came out I thought we were being pranked since it was April Fools. The enchiladas were okay every dish we got needed salt cuz the food was Bland. My daughter spaghetti sauce was separating from the noodles something I've never seen before but luckily she's not too picky so she still ate it. Are chicken fajitas were ridiculous we had maybe a half-dozen small strips of chicken, not even a half of one bell pepper, and maybe a quarter of onion. There was more plate than there was food. We told our server Sherry and she said yes she thought it looked bad when she got it too and took it right back and told them that we needed more food especially for $15. I guess the cooks told her they needed to charge us for it which is ridiculous. we will not be coming back to Blueberry Hill again. I'm so disappointed that a business that runs so bad and has double charge just before and another time brought us the wrong food and this time charged us and not give us enough food is still in business. I swear this service is the only thing keeping this business open. Sherry is the best server this business has and would definitely close down if it was not for her. you guys lost five valuable customers and we always tip well.",

It's the type of charming all American average hot plate special serving, oldies playing, sassy waitress having, down home diner that feeds the soul,  as much as a grumbling stomache. Blueberry pie a la mode and a coffee from here cures all ailments (of the psyche). And the clientele is as colorful as the fare! Whether it's two muscle bound brosephs fresh from lvac, scarfing giant omelets for mutual gains. Or stoner types on the other side giggling about the virtues of gaming. This place is not for the shallow or faint of heart. Go here, sip on a milk shake while listening to the classics on the jukebox like it's 19 something or other again.",

The food was good I got the French toast and the ham and cheese omelette with toast and hash browns the food was really delicious the hash browns especially they were fresh and really crispy just like I like them overall I enjoyed coming here again and outside of the bad date I still got that comfort relaxing diner feeling that I got the last time I came here overall this will still be one of my good to restaurants when I want to grab some breakfast lunch or dinner.",

The coffee was pretty good, but the oj wasn't fresh and at $2.39 a cup without refills, I don't think it's worth it.   We got our food. The chicken and waffles looked pretty small, but that might be because we had chicken and waffles at Hash House A Go Go last month. The chocolate chip pancakes looked so tasty and they had whipped cream on top to boot!  I didn't get to try the chicken and waffles, but Don finished them all without making any bad comments, to I'm assuming they were good. The pancakes were freakin heavenly! They were literally homemade from scratch and you could tell. They didn't stiff me on the chocolate chips like some places I've been to either.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to get breakfast and it's a plus that it's a local joint.",

I came here for breakfast and was pretty set on getting a waffle but after looking at their menu, there was a lot of back and forth between my desired waffle and everything else on the menu. What sold me on the waffle was the \"made with pure butter\" note in the Butter Cream Waffles section. So bad but butter makes everything better! I ordered the Fresh Fruit Compote Waffle with Strawberry and a side of sausages. The waffle was heaven...it was soft and sweet with a bit of toastiness to it. The strawberry compote was sweet and perfectly tart and had fresh strawberries in addition to the cooked fruit in the compote. I only wish that instead of canned whipped cream, the restaurant made fresh whipped cream to top the waffles.    Service here is very friendly. One thing I like about this restaurant is that their booth seating can seat up 6 people (booths are always fun), maybe 7 or 8 if you're with sticks. Also, check out the older waitresses with the their fun and colorful eyeglass strings. This location is in a shopping center so there's ample and easy parking.",

We got inside and were seated right away.  I didn't like that the waitress brought us little cups of water, and no straws.  I prefer to drink out of a straw, because you never know where the cup has been.  After reading through their enormous selection, we both finally decided on fruit pancakes (she had blueberry, I had strawberry) and a side of potatoes.  Boy, was ordering the potatoes a horrible idea!  When the waitress brought out the food, my stomach flopped.  The portion size of the pancakes is incredible!  Four huge pancakes smothered in blueberry/strawberry compote, whipped cream, and real fruit!  Time to dig in...  The pancakes were AMAZING.  I had as much as my tummy could possibly hold.  The potatoes were average, and tasted pretty good with salt and smothered in ketchup.  Paired along with the coffee we had, I would say I am going to be full until tomorrow.  Extremely good pancakes, friendly service, and causal atmosphere.  A little on the spendy side for pancakes and coffee - we spent $14 each.  Sure is different during the daylight hours.
