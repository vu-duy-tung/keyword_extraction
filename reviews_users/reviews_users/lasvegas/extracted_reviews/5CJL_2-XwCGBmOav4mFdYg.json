    "text": "The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.  Went for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.  Meanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat  Every so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.  \"Is everything okay? Everything except I haven't received my order.\"  Minutes later...  \"Is everything okay? Is there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.\"  Her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time  My plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.  We had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.  We sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.  \"What table was yours? The table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.\"  At that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave  She finally came out, and I got the lowdown.  - A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up) - Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager - Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.",

Yet again confirming my thoughts are the Yelp and Urbanspoon stickers on the door.   Lunch special from 11a-3p? Yes please! Beef drunken noodle + thai ice tea = $7.56. Yes thank you!  The thai ice tea is super sweet so I love it. The drunken noodle was a bit on the oily side but still pretty tasty. The portion seemed a little on the small side but I guess that means I can eat again in another hour.   This place is A-ok.",

The food is really quite good and cheap! The panang was just perfect, careful with your spicy level. I am normally an 8.5, but don't do an 8 here or you will be crying for more $1 ice drink! I find authentic places do their spicy levels quite well.  I'd opt for a 6 here to enjoy your food.  Service was so-so. It was not busy but the servers just don't seem to be around much after the food arrives.   Restroom is kinda dirty i think. But who cares...just come here for food!",

The chicken pad thai was too sweet and could have used a little bit more fish sauce. panang red curry was also too sweet for my taste. I asked for 8/10 on the spicy scale. But the sauce was a solid 5. Not until I ate a piece of red chili pepper then it really turn to a True 8.   May visit again to try some other dishes.",

    "text": "Great service, good ambiance, good service. Not much to rave about since I tried familiar dishes.   Ambiance:  I dined during the evening, so it was quite dim during this service. The decor seemed nice, as I did see some traditional Thai statues. There are TVs around for your viewing pleasure...however I believe infomercials are for viewing at home. During the entire service, Shaun T's new workout DVD was playing. Can this guy get any more greedy?!   Service: Very nice and pleasant. The server I think didn't quite understand what vegan meant or maybe the kitchen just heard \"vegetarian\" and assumed no meat but egg is fine. Though I did request no fish or oyster sauce and no egg, the dish came out with egg.   Food:  I ordered the papaya salad with no fish sauce. It was really good. I love spicy, and after reading a review before dining about how spicy spicy is, I went with a level 3 on the salad. That was still spicy for me. I think I'll order a 2 next time. I can't imaging what a 10 is.  The pad Thai was ok. Sadly this one didn't please. I was hoping to find something wow about it but instead it was a bit sweet and oily.   Presentation: The papaya salad is good to share. It was huge and very pretty looking... The pad Thai...well I don't think you can make it look pretty, but you can make it look tasty!   Overall: Loved that I was able to find a new Thai dining option. Would I come here often? Not so much, but if I were in the area, sure. I'll be sure to try other dishes too. I do find pad Thai and papaya salad to be on the safe side.   As a vegan, be sure to be very specific with your server and check the food before you eat it. I learned that lesson hard after eating in San Diego. Here at Krung Siam, I had to send back the pad Thai because it had egg in it.   Happy dining!",

When you are done partying on the strip you can take a quick cab over to Krungs and have amazing food until 5:30 in the morning. Best place to eat Thai food at any hour of the day.

The fried rice wasn't fried and looked like one and a half cups of rice with too much garnish and few shrimp, no taste what so ever!!! 14$?!! The soup was ok maybe ten shrimp in the pot. And way too much garnish mostly bamboo chutes, 19$!!! But the worst part about this place is the waitresses who care more about the music they are blasting and they took my order then played on the stage looking for music. Then she shouted out drink order to another girl who got it wrong and calls green tea water. Service sucks!!! First time I never tipped and I strongly believe in tips, I'm sure they got a tip from the two entrees and two tea being over forty bucks. Here is a tip don't go here if your hungry and want good service and a place to relax!!!! The music is annoying so loud, the waitresses don't speaka any enggwish lol and are rude!",

Arrived here with two other friends at around 6:45pm on a Thursday evening. We were seated immediately and was at a booth next to the stage where the live band played. (When we arrived the live band was still setting up)  The three of us ordered to share 1.) Thom Yum Seafood (I highly rate this dish and recommend it) it was perfectly zesty, hot and sour. The mixture of seafood was also impressive. There were scallops, fish, shrimp, scallops, crab meat, mussels and squid. I loved it! 2.) Beef Salad- Thai Style (I also highly rate and recommend the dish). The beef was tender and the spices were extremely tasty. This beef salad is probably one of the best that I have had in Vegas! 3.) Chicken padt Siew (I've had better but was decent).  The service was incredibly good. The waiters were very nice, attentive and courteous.   *be sure to ask for the chili tray*",

I've gone for lunch multiple times and during the very late night hour for a sober up meal. They have a great priced lunch menu that comes with soup, salad, egg roll and your entree in a bento box tray. It's not the most amazing thai food but it is decently authentic. I recommend the yellow curry, pad prik king and the sweet sticky rice with mango dessert is really good. *On the mango sticky rice dessert however mine had this chunk of rice that had a green tint to it. I asked if that was supposed to be that way and the server was unable to translate what it was that caused it. I just chose not to eat that part just in case.",

    "text": "This place really knows how to satisfy with their moist and flavorful pad thai! The noodles are soaked with delicious flavor, perfectly cooked, with lots of moist chicken, and I especially loved their fried soft tofu. The tofu adds a wonderfully luscious texture.   My boyfriend and I have eaten a lot of pad thai in Vegas since we've moved here and this one takes the crown. There is nothing better than juicy, moist, and flavorful pad thai noodles. Comfort food for sure. Major plus that they are open way late!   They are not afraid to use spices here, which is great for spice lovers like ourselves. Their spicy #8 had a great kick to it! (((True to spice))) Even their chili tray had everything you need: thai chilies in fish sauce, Serrano chilies in vinegar, sugar, and dry powdered chilies. The chilies were very spicy and flavorful (not for the faint of heart.)  We've also tried their other dishes and they aren't half bad - I just found minor annoyances with them.   Panang beef curry - Their version was watery, I prefer my curry thick. But the overall curry was actually flavorful. 3/5  Beef pad see ew - great flavor and very generous on the beef, I just wish they offered more noodles to balance the dish out. 4/5  Big plus that they are open late! The service here was quick at 2am on a Saturday. The ambiance was dark and the live Thai karaoke was entertaining. We've eaten here twice in a week already because that pad thai keeps calling my name. I just might become the duchess here because this is my new regular spot of pad thai!",

I don't carry the papers with me every where I go because it can be a hassle and I've never gone to a restaurant before that kicked me out because I had a service animal. Never going here again for the rude way they handled the situation with me.",

I know they are a little bit busy so we had to be patient, it took them 25mins to serve our food. we only ordered 2 dishes that's why I wasn't expecting to wait that long. Then during the meal nobody even checked on us. The food was kinda spicy so we needed some water and it took 10mins just to get the servers attention despite of us calling them they looked so busy with the big group. I just hope next time they would pay attention to other guests too. The food is good and some days the service is okaybut expect to wait long on you order.",

My second go went much better - I decided on the appetizer combo dish along with a Thai Beef Salad (level three spice this time). The beef was a little heavy on the lime, but other than that it was amazing. I can't recall having a mint and lime leaf salad before this... But I would definitely have it again.

Seafood Delight - Spicy 3: 14.99 4. 3 Steamed rice: 4.50  5. Garlic Pepper chicken: 9.99 6. Red Curry Beef: 10.99 for $85.05 (automatic 18% tip charge AFTER tax)    - Easy to spot, but hard to get to! Coming from the strip, off of Spring Mtn, and to this place, does everyone have to make an illegal u-turn off Valley View?! haha - Great looking bar and dine for a Thai restaurant, but bathrooms don't match! - Ambiance doesn't match service.  - Lame and lazy service. On a slow evening, we have to hunt down Takky to tell her we're ready to order, get drink refills, remove empty plates, organize our own table. No ass kissers here. Fail. - Tom yum had great flavor, strong sour and spicy taste. hot! Loved it, but a bit expensive for tom yum. Too much cilantro. - Pad Thai chicken was delicious! Just how I want my Pad Thai to taste.  - Seafood Delight was a dry and spicy. I couldn't imagine how it would taste if it were a 5! Yikes! Mussels are tiny but packed with flavor. Too much onions.  - Garlic Pepper chicken packed a punch of garlic! A Vampire's nightmare. Good with the broccoli.  - Red Curry beef was pretty good, but I should have just gotten the Panang. Ugh.. - Automatic gratuity = 6 or more in party. - SNEAKS! Charging tip after tax.",

    "text": "This place is a nice upscale, decently authentic Thai restaurant in Chinatown.  I had the Crab Rangoon, the duck curry, and some Thai Iced tea.   Overall I wasn't overly impressed, but I could see bringing friends or a date to this place.    The Crab Rangoon was very sweet.  The sauce reminded me of pomegranate jelly. Not bad, but definitely not the best.  Way too sweet in my book.  The Thai tea was alright, but it tasted a little cheap or perhaps with artificial sweeteners.  The duck curry (red curry) was the best part of the meal.  It was actually quite tasty.  This dish had a surprising mixture of green and red peppers, tiny chopped carrots, peas, fresh pineapple chunks, and raisins.  The red curry itself was satisfactory in taste, and had a watery texture that soaked well into the white rice.  It was served with the perfect level of spice (I asked for medium), and it was not too sweet.  Not a bad dish at all.  I didn't have any problems with the service, which I've noticed in a few reviews.  The place was mostly staffed by younger Asians, and they were having a good time while working, so maybe there are nights when the staff get carried away... I dunno.  The atmosphere was very classy though, with jazz music in the background.  I probably won't go back on my own again, but like I said earlier, this would be a nice place to take a date.",

    "text": "I have ate there at least 8 times before this visit and had a decent experience every time. But consistency is really the key, I prefer a place that is always C than a place that is 98% A+ and 2% F.   I used to order the tom yum soup with shrimp, which I always liked with spicy level 6. Not too spicy, not too mild for my taste. This last time, I'm ordering for the table, so I ask for less spicy than normal at 5, it's comes so ridiculously spicy that is not possible to eat it. I think okay, maybe only the mistake is in the soup, but when the food came with spicy levels of 4-6, same thing. MUCH MUCH hotter than my previous experiences (the previous time, maybe the prior week)  As the result, my friends have stomach pain all morning today.     In addition to that, our waitress was very very rude - showing us lots of attitude. They bring one of our plates 15 minutes before the other ones. I handed her my plate, and asked her if she could bring it with the rest of the food, and she literally rolled her eyes and left the plate down. Later on, she pours the soup on a friend, and doesn't even apologize. Unbelievable.   You might ask, why didn't you ask them to take the spicy food back to the kitchen. Because the waitress was so unaccommodating that we didn't feel like that is an option.  It really sounds I'm making this up or exaggerating, right? This many bad things can't happen all on the same day, you'd say. There might have been something wrong with this dude and his friends. Trust me, it was worse than I explained. I have eaten out most nights last 7-8 years, and this was the very first time I left $0 tip, and that was before hearing of stomach problem of my friends this morning.  To be fair and give benefit of the doubt, this was the night before Christmas, and they might have been out of their usual staff.",

    "text": "This place is how you do business. Located in China town this place stands out the most. Bear in mind there are a million other Thai spots on the street. So choosing this one was strictly based of Yelp reviews. Man am I glad we listened.  Walked in and first thing you see is a gorgeous stream of water running down a mirrored wall. At night it's beautiful and adds flair as you walk in. We were immediately greeted and sat. Restaurant wasn't too busy but again it was early dinner. I don't mind when it's slower because my food is faster and always tastes better.   We ordered our drinks and appetizers off the bat. We got and order of crab rangoons and a platter which consisted of chicken satay, spring rolls, crab Rangoons and pork dumplings. Each having their own sauce to dip in such as sweet and sour and peanut sauce. Best satay I have had in a LONG time. Spring rolls weren't my favorite but everything else was good for an app.  Our server came to take our order. He didn't write it down but spoke it back to us perfectly. Food came out staggered with entrees. I think they thought we were doing family style which we were not. So my meal came about 5 minutes later.  The staff seems to work as a team because I had about 4 different people waiting on us from order taking, to bussing, to drink refills. Team work makes it work better. I didn't sit there waiting for anything because someone was always around.  I obviously ordered Pad Thai. As we all know on here that's like all I get. Their spice meter is all over the place. I can handle spice and the 2 was a lot. For me it tasted great. For some at the table it was TOOOO hot and that was just a 2 out of 10. Pad Thai was great. Didn't have too many peanuts which I like an abundance of. I actually added pineapple to it and it made it even better. Try it next time you get pad Thai. All meals were large and can be split for two or good for take home left overs.  We all saw fried bananas on the menu so you KNEW that was happening. Came out at a good time. Not overly battered and very warm. The bananas were very tasty. I thought it was a caramel sauce on it but it was honey and I hate honey so I had to eat around it :( we had ours served with mango and coconut ice cream.  Other than that this place is great! Defiantly check it out if you are in China town. I know there is a lot to choose from but you won't regret this place.",

    "text": "When it's late and your hungry and you have a taste for Thai, Krung Siam is a perfect choice. We had the crab fried rice, panang curry chicken, rad nar with beef and the sweet sticky rice with lychee. The crab rice was very good, not overly greasy, not mind blowing but very nice on the palate. The rad nar was like an Asian version of an American beef stew but not as rich and heavy. It was warming on a cold winter night and the thick flat noodles were a delightful change of pace.  The panang curry chicken was loaded with flavor and I love the fact that they use white meat chicken which was very tender and cooked just right... they serve a bowl of white rice on the side which is great for absorbing all the delicious panang sauce, personally I think they need to make the side of rice a little larger. Finally, for dessert we had the sticky rice with lychee, it was served warm and had a mildly sweet flavor.  The lychee fruit added a nice touch with its combination of sweet and tart... we all agreed that we prefer the sticky rice with mango at Archie's best! I have been to this location a few times, originally at the recommendation of one of my poker dealer friends from a Strip hotel.  It is a high-quality, fantastic option for those people getting off of work late, just wrapping up from a night of partying or celebrating or like me - a mom with her daughter and her daughter's friend starving after a night of ice-skating at the Cosmo:-)",

This place needs to learn the old saying, \"The customer is always right.\" They have not only lost a client, but potential passengers I may have sent their way, as well.

    "text": "Went here expecting a great experience due to many of the good reviews about this place. The restaurant was clean and looked appealing, but you can't judge a book by its cover right? It all started with the drinks. A couple of my buddies came to eat and have a few drinks, but they didn't even have a bartender to make drinks that night. What restaurant has a bar with no bartender. I ordered a mojito and the person who made it crushed the mint leaves leaving a taste of chlorophyll in the drink. Then came the time to order the food. Ordering was easy and the waiter came by to check on us at a good time, but after ordering we waited for nearly over an hour for the food to come. The restaurant wasn't all too busy and during that wait the waiter did not come to check on us once and I had to flag down the waiter just to ask when the food will be ready. After an hour the food came and by that time we weren't all that hungry anymore. When the check came our waiter said sorry for the wait we have applied a discount to your check and walked away. They gave us a 10% discount and it wasn't applied to the drinks and didn't even cover the tax. When we asked for the manager to plead our case he said \"we applied a discount and that's all we can do\" and then proceeded to walk away. Now I'm not the type to complain, but that was the worst experience I've had eating at a restaurant. Won't be coming back again. Would give zero stars if I can.",

I've been to Lotus of Siam and it's awesome, but I also like to explore around of all the good eats in Vegas.  Food: - Grilled Squid ($10): BOMB. Must order. It's serve with two sauces, the green cilantro is my FAV (wish I can learn their recipe) and it's a FULL SQUID.  - Tom Yum with Shrimp ($13 bowl): this was delicious. We ordered level 6 spicy and that was pretty spicy. I recommend to order 4-5 to enjoy it (that's btw mild and med). Amazing flavor and comes with 5 shrimp if you choose shrimp. A Bowl only only feed 2-3 ppl.   - Thai Basil Beef Rice ($12): AMAZING. One thing it's missing is a sunny side up egg. This is probably one of the best basil rice I had. I come from 626 with restaurants such as Noodle World, President Thai, Daisy Mint, Saladang, etc.   Overall: We came here on a Saturday about 8pm. Got seated immediately. Service was spectacular. They were very attentive and not once did we have to ask to refill our drinks. I highly recommend to check out this place if you are in town. This has shorter wait time and great tasting food.",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge * 59/100  Landed here with the parentals during another of our foodie ventures.   Spotlight goes to their $5.99 lunch specials.   Frankly, I was skeptical about trying this place out at first, especially after hearing mixed reviews. Alright, maybe the servers were not as homey or warm as I would've expected them to be - but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and take it that I do get groggy myself at that time of day (2pm). Nonetheless, they got our orders down like lightning and our food arrived in less than 10 minutes.  Papa had the sweet and sour shrimp, mommy had garlic and pepper chicken and I got the yellow curry beef. I must've been the most satisfied out of the three of us. Curry was extra mild, as requested and the coconut milk brought out a rich overall flavor to the dish. I'd say it was sweet with a touch of spiciness - not eye-watering hot, but enough to keep the spoonfuls coming in.  Mommy liked her chicken. Didn't last too long. Papa wasn't too keen on his order because he said that it tasted like pre-cooked, pre-packaged and refrigerated shrimp tossed into a plate of sweet and sour sauce. To put it simply, I guess he meant that the flavor did not soak in too well.   Oh and how could I forget? We absolutely loved the soup! (it came with the lunch specials) Would've liked it too if there were side servings of egg roll and fried wonton for every order like the krung siam website said. Salmon was crossed out the menu for some reason (that was going to be my first option) so it's best to not rely on their site to be in the know how about what they currently have.   We'll be back here again for lunch soon. Enjoyed the peaceful ambiance and papa had a great time keeping score of the NBA playoffs thanks to the tellies lined up along the walls. They each had a different sport playing. At some point, he needed to know a team's score so I sifted through my phone to check it and hola, there was wi-fi! Could've been jacked from the starbucks right beside (very very possible) but still, you get to access it and that's the best part.",

    "text": "First off my girl and I have eaten here multiple times.. And every time it was mediocre service. This visit- at around 3:30am was our final due to the exceptionally shitty service.  We are both greeted and asked if we want either a booth or a table.. Then we are walked to our spot.  The host dude leaves us the menu.. Walks away. When he comes back we're ready to order so we do. We ask for the Tom Kha, no spicy no mushrooms with chicken, sticky rice and the drunken noodles no spicy no tomatoes with shrimp. Water an coke to drink.  There are 3 other groups of people besides us. So we wait... Our drinks come- then the server takes our order of soup to another table and theirs to us. We tell her, no thank you--wrong. Mean while this server is scrambling around trying to take care of all of us while the host kid has tape on all of his fingers dancing, no really.. Dancing around the restaurant trying to do closing work.. An hour and a half before they close. Since I've been here before I know this kids a server, I've had him.  We get our soup... It's warm............... Asked for the sticky rice, she brings it over. Then she brings the drunken noodles---- it has damn tomato quarters in it! I asked specifically for no tomatoes.. You're a server, you have 1 job, serve me and get my order correct. This is why you check it when it's in the window still. However, being as picky as I am.. I pick the tomatoes out. My girl starts waving at the waitress as she is talking to a co worker who's eating... Then she says heeeeeeey!!! So the waitress walks over and we ask for the check and some boxes to take our meal home.. The waitress takes our plates away and boxes every thing up for us- DOPE! Brings us our boxed food and the check.  Meanwhile host kid is still dancing around with strands of tape on his fingers.. Stop.  When we get home I pull the to go box out of the bag and there's a mfkin HAIR on the outside of the box... That leads inside the box onto my drunken noodles. That's why I'm changing my what was 2 star to a 1 star(right now). Needless to say I won't be eating my noodles   Okay. Rant over.",

The only thing I really don't agree on is the price. $11 for pad thai with chicken. And $14 for pad thai with shrimp is a bit much for the portion. I ordered the basil chicken, I might be expecting much since I'm thai but still, the basil chicken doesn't really taste that great to me. But the pad thai and pad see ew and I guess everyone said that it was good. Another thing I liked is that they got my orders right. It a bit complicated but the orders came all correct. And the deliver was super fast.",

So I know what I'm saying when I say this place was great! We were a bit iffy to come here b/c of the ratings...but I'm happy we did!   We got seated next to the little stage and speakers. First thought, damn, we're right next to the speakers! A young guy came on and started singing Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and stuff! He was playing the guitar while singing and he was realllly good! And no, sitting next to the speakers weren't bad at all. The sound system was well balanced.   My brother and I ordered the beef and chicken pad thai, that was prob one of the best I've had! My other bro just ordered the rib appetizers and it came out in a pan roast thingy in flames! So my 10 yr old bro thought he was tight lol. My parents ordered some chicken sour soup and fish and that was good too....idk if we just came on the right day or what, but all of our foods to be delicious! Would def come back again.   Also...try the Thai tea!!!",

    "text": "So not good. What a waste of my time and money.  My friend and I are from NYC and we were looking for a place to have thai food and listen to thai music or thai karaoke. Before we went to the restaurant we called and asked them if they had any sort of entertainment and they said yes, they start at 12:30-1am. We arrived at 2 am and there was no entertainment at all, just regular music on the radio. That was the first disappointment.  The food was horrible. I'm Thai and this place does not do Thai food justice. Not authentic, even if you're going for Americanized thai food it still wasn't good. The grilled beef was so dry and the sauce was just not right. The papaya was too sweet, I like my food to be on the sweet side so if I say it was too sweet you know it was. Everything else was just bland. My friend also ordered a soup which we never got. The waitstaff was friendly but they were coordinated with each other. Service was kind of all over the place.   In a nutshell just don't go. Kung fu across the street is a much better option for thai food.",

    "text": "While there's nothing wrong with the stereotypical 'dive' type Thai place with photos of Thailand & the King on the walls, it's nice to know of at least one upscale Thai place -- especially one that's not overly expensive-- and Krung Siam is it for me!   I was solo & sat at the bar.  Waitstaff was very friendly, and my drink & appetizer arrived quickly, with my entree showing-up a suitable amount of time later.       Ambience is kind of like a bar/lounge (which is I think how the place markets itself).  They had music up somewhat loud.  Not uncomfortably so, but if you're there on a date or with a group of people, it might be hard to carry on much of a conversation.   I was there on a Thursday evening at about 6PM.   The place wasn't crowded at all.  For this type of place plus being in Vegas, I was probably there at least an hour or two before it might start to get busy.",

It's open super late which is convenient for my schedule when I'm here, the food doesn't really take a hit on quality like restaurants usually do when they're open such long hours. I came here with a huge group of ppl from Thailand and I think it was a good sign that they chose this place over other close by Thai restaurants including the famous lotus!  Honestly don't see why this place is 3.5, it should be rated much higher IMO. The ingredients in the dishes are all very fresh and blasted with flavor. Another plus with this place is the portions are very generous.   When I came with the large group we were celebrating so we ended up ordering essentially one of everything on the menu. If I were to highlight a few dishes I would choose the coconut chicken soup, beef slices, and the pineapple rice.   Been here 3x during my Vegas stay so far and I'm sure I'll be back!",

I am SO glad we did! Everything about this place is great! Atmosphere, staff, food, entertainment, presentation were fantastic. Our server, Sam, was great. Very informative and friendly. He asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-10 and I'm glad I said 3. It was the perfect spice that it wasn't so overpowering that I couldn't taste all the other flavors. Neither of us had an empty glass on the table, and my husband had at least 4 refills. He never had to ask for one. We are definitely going back and recommending them to everyone we know.",

The atmosphere was very lively and the waiting staff was friendly and quick.  I ordered the Pad Thai (Chicken) which was good, but maybe not great?  My girlfriends yellow curry on the other hand was pretty spectacular.  The one down side to the yellow curry though is that our 5 out of 10 spice choice was pretty dang spicy.  The waiters were laughing a little at her each time they filled her water cup that she kept having to retreat to.  Unless you are certain that you love spicy hot challenges, I would recommend getting a 3 and asking for some chili paste on the side to kick it up a notch.  Overall, really good experience and look forward to going back.  Will update the review if the spiciness is a more tamable level next time.",

There must be some new cooks, because everything I ordered was sweet when it shouldn't be at all. I most likely will find a new spot to enjoy Thai since this place has gone down hill. Music is good, but even the service has dropped off.  There are far too many other places in China town that are way above this place.  My recommendation is to go somewhere else.",

Now, I love spicy foods and can handle spiciness. When I go to Thai places and order my pad thai spicy, I usually request my spiciness in the B grading scale range. Soooo....I ordered my chicken pad thai with a level 8. HOLY SHIT.....this was wayyyyy tooo spicy for me. I couldn't even eat my dish because my entire mouth was burning. Even with a small bite, I had to gulp down water. I got full off water. So if you plan on making any of the dishes spicy, take it down a notch or two.....or three.",

    "text": "A poor experience.  The decor and ambiance were promising. Everything was soft, soothing, and clean. Unfortunately, I'm more concerned with the food. I had been here once before, and I ordered a lackluster drunken noodle dish. Giving this place another chance (because I really like Thai), I ordered a lunch special Chicken Panang extra spicy with an appetizer of fresh spring rolls. To drink I ordered Thai Tea.  The Thai Tea came out with a glass of water. The water was clearly tap water. It had an odd aftertaste. One sip and I was done. The Thai Tea was meh.  The spring rolls were interesting. The menu indicated lettuce, bean sprouts, mint, sweet basil, cilantro, carrot and tofu. I received 4 rolls standing on one end. The top end overflowed with ingredients. The mint and basil were delicious. There was actually very little sprouts, and a lot more lettuce than in normal spring rolls. I prefer shrimp; however, I suspect they used Vietnamese pork sausage rather than tofu. Two rolls fell apart while trying to separate them from one another. While the actual spring rolls were lack luster, the peanut sauce included was actually quite good.  The soup included with the lunch special was a vegetable soup. I'm glad I asked, because they actually forgot to serve it to me. The Panang was not well done. Heat level was probably about a 3 (I asked for 15 on a scale of 1-10). The Panang was also very watery.  I was disappointed. I don't think that I'll return to this restaurant again.",

    "text": "I really did not want to write a negative review about this spot, but after so many negative experiences during late hour service, I have to at least admit that there is consistency in one aspect. This place is notoriously terrible for customer service and the food is always inconsistent. The first few times I came here with friends after work, the food was alright. I have tried the papaya salad, the pad thai, the pad \"z-u,\" drunken noodles, chicken wings, tom yum, and the thai bbq chicken.   Best dish here is hands down the chicken wings because they are the only things that are consistently good. It is insane how that statement can even be said about a thai spot especially since they are just frozen wings that are deep fried with a little sweet thai chili sauce with cilantro.   The pad thai here is overly sweet and sometimes drenched in sauce. The pad see ew inconsistently comes with flat noodles that are broken up and it almost does not even feel like a noodle dish because there is so much inconsistency with the way the noodles are in this bowl. Same principle goes for the drunken noodles.   The tom yum soup is ok at best, unless you come at a time where they serve it to you at \"room temperature,\" and it is super sour at other times. I stopped ordering it altogether because it came out super salty the last time and the salt kick was disheartening more so than the times it was at a wrong temperature or when it was sour. There is zero flavor balance.   Thai bbq was good when I ordered it, but the portion was very small for what I had grown used to at other thai spots around town like PinKaow.   So, after review of all the food I have had over the dozen times I have been there, I can say the food is a close  2-3 star experience for your money. However, with the service also having consistency in being awful every time I am there, I give that a solid 1/2-1 star experience.   This spot is open late night, so it limits options for thai for all hours, but honestly, I won't be recommending going back here for anyone. Last night I went with a few of my best friends and service was terrible yet again. I asked for thai bbq chicken and the waiter completely forgot about the order and by the time we were done eating, I had to ask another waiter to make sure to take that off the check because it was an oversight. There was no apology at all on their end and if anything, the guy looked annoyed for their mistake? I thought that was pretty hilarious.  The same waiter refilled my iced tea with water and when I pointed that out, he snapped at me and said, \"I'll get you another one.\" Wow for sincerity? You messed up, & couldn't at least apologize?   Last week when I brought a couple of my friends here after work, the waiter gave us the check after our appetizer order. I asked him why he gave it to us preliminarily, and he had no idea we hadn't received our food! Yay!-for paying attention! We waited over 35 minutes for dinner and this guy handed us the check after chicken wings LOL. Unbelievable.  Myself, & my connections in hospitality won't be coming back to this place ever. Service is gawd-awful and food is not worth the trip. I recommend going to Pin Kaow on eastern near BJ's and Crepe Expectations. There are other good thai spots like Lucky Thai that are mountains better than this rude, salty spot.   Let me just advise you guys that this location has been closed down in the past and with service etiquette and inconsistent food quality, you will be on that same road for the future. This is not the best way to run a restaurant. This place needs to incorporate some training for the staff to be better and not so terrible to guests. Tips are earned, & it says a lot when all of us food & beverage industry people feel like we've wasted our money on shit service. Maybe management needs to notice.",

Uber is so cheap, better safe then sorry especially the way I drink in vegas lol)  So far everything I've tried here is good.  Soup, crab fried rice, yellow curry, pad thai, BBQ chicken...  The only thing I don't enjoy that much is (I'm not sure exactly the schedules) but on weekends I think I've encountered live music which since I'm not thai I do not enjoy.  But rest of time they either play hip hop or EDM   perfect for drinking w friends...our preparty spot before we head out for a crazy night   Overall:  I've been here over six times now and I haven't had any issues here what so ever which to me is awesome!!!

    "text": "Been here dozens of times but never left really happy. Just always a consistent 3-4 star. Service is lacking at least half the visits. Food is spendy and the prices have really went up recently, less specials or deals. Greedy. Most things have small servings too. Food is decent but I've had a lot of just average quality dishes.   Getting refills is hard, tonight I had an empty ice tea for 15 minutes and was little rude when I said to take it off my bill. Not the first time this has happened.  I asked for a larger salad with my skewers, just ignored the request. For $11 it should come with a bigger portion but I didn't mind spendy extra but he didn't even try to help me.   Curry is just okay, veggies little too big and hard, little watery, and small. Tried all of them here.   Cucumber salad is good but little spendy now at $5 Coconut was good but $6 each.    Mentioned yelp for 10% off but didn't apply the discount. Ignored so many things, didn't even speak to us hardly at all, just weird looks and nods. This happens to often here, gets old.   The owners sure know how to take a 4-5 star place and make it an overpriced 2-3 star at best.",

The music and live singing are always top notch and really create an atmosphere that is hard to find in other restaurants on the Strip.     About the food...at this point i always order the same because I dont have time to be dissappointed. I stick to what i know when coming to Chinatown but on this occasion i tried the chicken satay and it was good but it tasted like the coated the chicken in egg and water.   The deep dried cornish hen is always fantastic and the thai basil fried rice is legendary in my book. The items look better eating in than getting it to go.   Ill be back for sure.",

Let me tell you that medium spice did not play, it was definitely on the spicier side of things but still very good. The portion size was large too, enough for two meals.   Overall the food was delicious and I'd definitely order again. Thanks for keeping my weekend vibes real!",

I was skeptical because It was not to busy on sunday night but after for a while I was there, without I realized it they had a full house one of my coworker came here not to long ago and she liked it, that's why she took us here. They do have a good food, good service and good atmosphere.  I like they way they have plenty space on their dinning place, it's not to crowded with tables and chairs so it's easy to walk arround.  They have a place in the middle with a small band, I think they have a live music but I don't know when. When I was there, They put a nice soft music, it's not to loud so we still can talk normal without screaming. All the server had a good attitude..So nice,their smile, polite, kept refill our water.   Their spiciness level from 1 (not spicy) - 10 ( spicy). I love spicy food so I ordered spicy #8, even thou I can feel the heat but I add their thai chili vinegar + dry chili + chili sauce. I ordered beef pad see(z) ew ($ 10.99)..Flat noodle stir with soy sauce + scramble eggs + chinese broccoli + beef.  My co workers had chicken drunken noodle ( $ 10.99), beef pad thai ($10.99), chicken yellow curry ( $ 10.99), fried rice ( $ 10.99) also we shared crispy spring roll (egg roll $ 9.99), Garlic shrimp ( $17.99). For me their fried rice to much black pepper but my coworker like it like that. Their garlic shrimp had a good flavour but I wish the shells have more crunch so easy to eat, a little bit to hard. But overall I love my pad z-ew We all really enjoy it, yummy We'll be back soon Ps: forgot to take a picture of chicken yellow curry",

    "text": "Wanted some late night Thai and this place was a surprise with flavor.   BF and I got    Basil Scallops - for $12, they are generous with the scallops and the flavor of the basil was great on this with fresh, properly cooked scallops. Loved this.   Tofu Pad See You (their spelling, which is cute) - this was good as far as noodles go. Slightly sweeter than usual places and more heavy on the egg. I didn't mind it only because no matter what I always put a little bit of chili vinegar on mine to be tangy sweet but it may be a bit saccharine for some.   No karaoke that night being done, but had music playing that sounded almost like a recording of karaoke which was funny and odd.   It left a good enough impression that the BF wanted to get scallops there again so we went back a week later.   This time we got scallops with ginger which was good, but bit too gingery for the BF and he preferred the basil style instead.   We also got tofu garlic pepper which was in a garlicky gravy like sauce. The garnish was generous with lettuce which I thought was kinda odd, but somehow worked well into being part of the dish when it was slightly wilted.   This time there was a guy with a guitar singing which was alright since the level wasn't too loud in there. It seems a lot of the complaints is because of the provided entertainment. I don't get it, I don't prefer it, but if I have to I won't mind so long as I can still have a conversation and be able to tune it out to background noise.   Service was alright both times...you may have to flag people down here if you need something but nothing too terrible of a wait for things.   Overall, I like the food I've had here so I'll definitely come back. Maybe not for day, but late night choices are very important for night owls like us.",

They got our drinks orders out quickly and the food was surprisingly quick as well considering how big our group was. I had pork drunken noodles :) spicy level 5 out of 10. It was perfect. Spicy enough to enjoy. I had my sticky rice as well and Thai tea :) and a Thai beer :( they didn't have beer Lao but I think I got Sappora (sp?)

We ordered the deep fried Cornish Hen which came on a huge platter. It was seriously a meal for two. If you love cilantro which we do, you must order this dish. We also ordered the Garlic shrimp which was so very good. The garlic bits were so delicious. I've never had garlic prepared like that before and wish I knew how they did it. The Sticky rice with Mango was very good also.   This will probably be one of the first restaurants I will return to the next Ike I am in Vegas.",

After I see what was given, I wish I had dined in, to get my money's worth... and I'm still hungry haha! I ordered the spicy eggplant entree, with tofu. Was great. But I wouldn't recommend taking out. If you do, make sure you don't let the container fall on the side. The container is like a bento box with two sections -- entree on one side, eggroll in the other. The sauces from the entree will flow over and soak the eggroll. The server that took my order was very knowledgable and friendly. Restaurant was not at capacity, but then again, 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon. I keep hearing about a live band, but I guess that's only a evening thing.",

NEXT TIME GO ALL SCALLOPS, they were great.  The Fresh Spring Rolls was our appetizer, lots of lettace and only a little Tofu but the Peanut Sauce was much better than Pho Kim Long.

My friends and I love Thai food, and Krung Siam offers some of the best in LV Chinatown. I am a huge fan of their Pad Thai, which is a perfect balance of spice, peanuts, and flavorful noodles. I have also tried, and enjoyed, both their Pad See Ew and Boat Noodle Soup. The soup is particularly good when I'm feeling under the weather.  My problem really comes down to the service. I guess it seems like they don't care. I ordered Pad See Ew with beef once, and it came out with chicken. I told them that it was fine since I'm not one to make a fuss, but like most people, I expect to get what I order. Whenever we come here, I just feel as if our table is getting ignored. I have to look around before anyone comes to check up on us. We usually come late night when it isn't super busy, too. They do have a karaoke stage, which is apparently pretty popular. I don't care too much for hearing random people sing in Thai, but that's probably just me. You should definitely still come for the food, and maybe you will have a better experience with the service.",

(At least on New Year's Eve he was on tune...)  Our food order was messed up.  The Thai Spicy 8 was barely spicier than the no spicy.  And the one dish I specifically said no spicy (for my young son) was spicier than the two level two spicy dishes.  The waitress filled my son's Sprite with water.  The Cashew Nut was almost entirely celery and the Pad Thai was made with glass noodles...  But my bigger problem is that the food was just okay.  I used to drive across the valley to eat here but my neighborhood Thai places are much better.    So they aren't bad.  If I'm on this side of town I may even stop in again, but with all the other choices of places to eat, I don't think so.  And I'm definitely not driving across town for them.",

A few months ago we had ordered some pad Thai and the sauce came out tasting like BBQ sauce. We asked for a new dish and they said NO THATS HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. Wow, they couldn't even offer anything else.  They charge over $12 for a main dinner entree which doesn't even amount to a lunch PORTION. They skimp you on everything. We went back last week and I ordered drunken noodles lunch special. They now charge $8.99 for it and its a BENTO BOX. I literally got 3 pieces of broken up noodles with 4 pieces of shrimp and a side of rice. Its not supposed to come with rice but they did it to make up for the noodles...so why even call it a noodle dish? It ended up being mostly veggies too. We send it back and they just took off the rice portion and added maybe a spoonful of noodles! It was a WTF moment.  I highly suggest you stay away if you've had real Thai food and don't want to pay $12+ for a tiny dish! Their service and food has gone downhill. They are robbing customers for $$!",

We had the garlic shrimp, the chicken wings, pad Thai and Tom Yum hot pot to share for our party of 6 (we had double orders of every dish). Everything tasted fantastic but the True winner of the night was the pad Thai. This was hands down the best pad Thai I've ever had in the States, so congratulations KS! I'm very excited to come back to this restaurant with friends when I'm in town and I'm happy to recommend it to anyone visiting the LV area.   Service was great, prices were decent and the decor and mood was inviting.",

We went here instead and what a great decision that turned out to be.  Its very spacious with high ceilings so you never feel crowded in.  The staff is friendly, efficient. All the food was freshly prepared with a prep time of about 15 minutes.  I don't know the correct names of all the dishes we tried but I will describe them.   We started with the Crab Fried Rice. It's a moist rice dish that has a mild flavor but an abundance of lump crab meat throughout.  The next one was  Red Curry Chicken in a coconut milk broth.  It's well balanced between spicy, sweet,and savory.  Next the combination sea food Pad Thai.  It has crab, muscles, and shrimp served over noodles. Another well balanced dish.  A must try for seafood lovers.  Now my favorite dish was the crispy pork belly served over greens.  This shows that a dish doesn't have to be overly complicated to taste great.  The pork is somehow crispy and tender at the same time.  While the greens were cooked with a quick stir fry.  Its a simple dish that is simply delicious! For dessert we had Ice cream with strawberries, chocolate served with flat bread triangles.  It was not overly sweet and a nice finish to our meal.  We spent $60.00 in all.  The price was right for what we received.  I'm adding Krung Siam to my favorite restuarant list.",

Spicy basil fried rice w/over easy egg - egg came fried which sucked hard cause there was no yolk to spread over the rice. The rice was amazing! Lots of basil flavor. No spicy though so not sure why it's called \"spicy basil fried rice\"  Pad Thai - they were good. Got the combo and the meat was not overcooked which was great! Huge portion!  Panyang curry - very delicious and sweet and smooth.   Will try more food next time.  Downside is the delivery guy took an hour to come even though they were 5 min away from us... And then the delivery guy couldn't figure out how to get into the building cause he went to the wrong entrance... Had to come down from my room to find him ... Also when I called to order they told me to order online cause It's hard to communicate with their language barrier... So they lose a star for poor customer service skills.",

My order was the boat noodle soup and a Thai ice tea. The soup arrived quickly and contained hot and spicy rice noodle soup with rare steak, beef stew, beef balls, liver and tendon. The broth was so yummy and tasty! I thought I was back in Phuket Thailand.   This place is underrated compared to some other popular Thai restaurants in L.V. They offer live entertainment in the evenings. They also accept credit cards and the service here is exceptional!",

The spicy basil fried rice was better with an added fried egg on top. It was nice that they ask for the spiciness level on a scale of 1-10. As someone who likes moderate, 7 was just fine. My friend who likes mild, thought 5 was a little too spicy. Service is friendly, and we were never without our lemony water. Music was top hits but not too loud. It was great for a group of 9 of us.",

It's very poorly lit and it's not a place where you can have a conversation while eating your food because the waiters and waitresses keep coming back and forth asking if everything's okay. They did that to me for a total of 28 times. It was insane! I've never been asked that sooo many times in my life during a visit to a restaurant. Okay enough about my experience and on to the food.  I ordered boat noodles which is a favorite for me at other Thai spots.. I told them no tendon and what do I see when I first get my bowl of soup? TENDON.. No Bueno! So I don't say anything because I always think to myself that they can do something to my food if I complain so I take the tendon out myself like champ. Then the broth was just overpowering and salty. Unfortunately I have a bad experience here and won't be coming back ever.",

We started with one Thai coffee and one Thai yes. The coffee was out favorite and the Thai tea was good. We liked how they came in tall cups, but there was a little too much ice in both drinks. We got the chicken Pad Thai lunch special and salmon lunch special. An egg drop soup was served to start which was good and an egg roll was served as well. The egg roll was good when dipped into v the sauce. The salmon was great. It had a garlicky flavor to it and there were vegetables that it came with that were lightly sauteed in that garlicky sauce which made it really yummy. The Pad Thai was okay and we actually took most of it home because we were full. We did get the mango and sticky rice for dessert which the rice had a green tint but was delicious!",

The soup wasn't the best I've ever had and the sad part is that I've had better tom yum soup at my own kitchen, the soup was too sweet for my taste. The seafood delight was kind of good, some kind a mixture of fruit of the sea mixed with Asian vegetables served on a sizzling plate and a side of steamed rice, not bad food but nothing that would make me make that illegal u turn on valley view again.  The price you pay for the food should come with better than fast food restaurant service but that's just what we got. Waitress took our order delivered the food and we were left on our own for the rest of the meal, not even checked on us once. By the end of the meal I was chewing on ice to help me swallow the rest of my food. I even had to do that embarrassing signature on the air to get the check and signed it while the dirty plates were still on the table. I started to wonder if I had to pick the plates up on my way out.  As we left no one said thank you........is it asking for too much after leaving 20% tip for no service? If I ever go back I'll make sure I go there during karaoke time and sing gangnam style as their punishment!",

The faucet requires push down on one hand while washing the other. I can't imagine how one can wash/clean hand that way. I don't want to think how the chef and server do after using the restroom.  Pad Thai was ok, the noodle stuck together. The beef and basil was not good as I didn't expect they used ground beef. This is not a restaurant dish in my opinion. I can make better. Tum yum soup in the hot pot was actually better than I expected. Green and red curry was ok. Not enough chicken and veggies in there.",

We decided to split some entrees among the three of us.  The portions were good and the food was a bit more spicy than we hoped (even though we asked for less than medium), but still yummy.  The prices are reasonable, but actually not much different from what I would expect to see in NYC.  Was hoping for a little bit more of a bargain, but not bad.

I really liked the restaurant setting and decor, everything is very classy.",

We've tried all their curries and while they are all really good, we decided last night that the yellow curry with vegetables is our favorite. We usually get around a 3 on the spicy level just because I feel like the spicier it is the more it takes away from the actual flavor. And this place is definitely full of flavor when it comes to their curry and noodles. The drunken noodles are definitely my go to. I went about a month ago and they had run out of the drunken noodles which I was bummed about, but I can't blame them because they are amazing! I ended up getting the pad Thai and it was almost equally as good. The only thing I wouldn't recommend on the menu was the fresh spring rolls. The peanut sauce it came with was good but the overall roll lacked flavor and tasted like lettuce. We decided we should have just gotten the fried spring rolls. Maybe next time! But I do highly recommend the Thai Siam tea on the drink menu, best spiked Thai tea ever!",

They'd come out, we'd try to kill them with a napkin and miss. They'd go back and come back out after a few minutes. We had to squeeze into one side of the booth to keep an eye out for them. We told the waitress, who saw one still browsing around and she got the manager, who then tried to kill it using a napkin and a cell phone flash light. He missed and walked away without saying anything. No apology or anything! I was so disgusted that I didn't finish eating. We left and won't be going back.",

Now, i'm not thai, but you could really taste the complex flavors and cooking style were not watered down for americanized taste buds.  I ordered the Thai Basil with steamed tofu and the sauce was just to die for! perfect balance of sweet, salty, basil flavor. The eggplant basil dish was also mind blowing. The eggplant was slightly caramelized and meaty. The drunken noodles had soft, succulent noodles. the Pad thai was so different from the overly-peanutted(is that a word?) dishes I've had elsewhere. Lots of great flavor & texture everywhere.  We also orderd a pot of tom yum soup for the table which was fantastic. However, please be warned, those are not green beans in there! it was a 5 alarm fire in my mouth for a minute when i took a bite into one of those chiles!  The prices are great - $4.99 lunch specials during the week and $8-$15 entrees otherwise. Everything was out of this world delicious. Don't miss this place if you are in Vegas and have a hankering for Thai food! I wish I had a place like this near home.  oh, also, it's in the Chinatown area off the strip so you can also go get foot massages at sketchy places across the street. ;-)",

The main thing is they have changed the Lunch Menu that my coworkers and I loved so much. They increased the price two dollars and turned them into bento boxes. The added a side (crab rangoon or spring roll) and a salad. They also increased the price of the drinks to $2. I personally did not experience a difference in quality in the food but two of my coworkers complained that the dishes they normally get had changed in flavor and were not as good. They also dropped a couple favorites. I enjoyed the addition of the crab rangoon and would have been okay with the salad but the dressing is not very good. The main difference is that where my coworkers and I would visit this place for lunch once and maybe twice per week, we have begun looking for other options.  I hate it but it looks like we won't be visiting as much in the future.",

    "text": "Brown rice? Check. Solid Thai flavors? Check! After dining at Krung twice, the food does not disappoint, but I am not sure it will become one of our repeat eats. We have sampled tom kha gai and tom yum soups, red curry and the dish simply called \"Broccoli.\" A bowl of soup is quite generous, and both soups had a rich, pleasing flavor. However, they also come served with lots of the herbs and roots that contribute to this flavor, which is mildly frustrating if you're not one to chew down on lemongrass and galanga. I admit this may be a white girl thing, but I end up putting all those things on the side because they seem too tough to chew. Am I wrong?  (I decided to Google and thanks to Kasma Loha-unchit and her article here <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thaifoodandtravel.com%2Fingredients%2Flemongrass.html&s=90a29d66220491bc1f40a8282ef997f4b7a0939630b2f4f73967e5e66bff4cc2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thaifoodandtravel.com/in...</a> learned: \"In soups, lemongrass serves as a stock ingredient to flavor the broth; the tough pieces are not meant to be chewed and eaten. Thai people usually do not strain them out before serving; they know what can be eaten and what cannot, and some like to suck on the lemongrass pieces for a delightful hit of flavor.\")  So, it is more authentic way to serve the soups, and I am just being a baby.   The curry was good. The \"Broccoli\" had a great wok flavor, but the sauce was a little light, and their steamed tofu isn't my favorite.  So, why won't we repeat eat? It was most likely a late night destination for us given its hours, and the fact that during the day we have some fave go-to spots. And, late night they have live entertainment which created a less than ideal dining environment. It is simply one gentleman with a guitar and a semi-karaoke set up, but it is a little loud and prone to drunk hijinx. If you are also drunk, wildly entertaining, but if you are just hungry, a boozy lady sitting on stage doing her best to belt out Bob Dylan and other songs that the guitar man simply just doesn't know for close to 20 minutes is simply frustrating. I don't even know if it was supposed to be karaoke, or if she just decided she had the right to sing. I can appreciate a well done, Thai karaoke throw down, but that is not what was happening here. I suppose the restaurant isn't completely to blame for their patron's less than ideal manners, but I kept hoping someone would kindly escort her back to her table with the lure of some free delicious item.  If we walk up to the door and see the man on the stage, we will probably decide it's not the meal for us given the opportunity for microphone takeovers. However, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the food, and our service was acceptable. Definitely worth it at a late hour when you're running out of options, and, hey, perhaps the danger of late night karaoke is your thang! Maybe we will return for lunch.",

    "text": "This is the first Thai restaurant I've visited that provide live music  entertainment.  It's very nice inside, very polished, nicely decor and the tables and both weren't all crammed in together. They also have a bar and plenty of flat screen TVs all around the room. We (my fiance and I) decided to order their Pad Thai. I believe it was like 10.99 and you get to pick your choice of meat. For $3 more you can have shrimp and you get 3 or 4 pieces of shrimp. If you wanted to add seafood combination that's also another $3. I wasn't happy with the Pad Thai because it was way too soggy and sweet. Service was okay. The waitress quickly came around and asked is everything alright after we got our food. We waited a good 10 minutes before I got frustrated and told my guy to flag down our waitress for our bill. The waitress said something my guy didn't understand. Minutes later I was able to get one of the other waitress attention and she went to give get us our bill. If I saw a designated station where you can pay after waiting 10 plus minutes I would have already pay my bill and went on my happy way. This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that you just don't know where you can take your bill. This restaurant is not very organized. There were more than 4 employees standing around behind the bar talking and just 2 waitress on the floor and it was almost a full house. The price is pretty high but you're paying for the entertainment. This restaurant does not have the best location. It's located in China Town. The parking is alright. If it had not been for the entertainment I would give this restaurant 1 star.",

I scoped the place out looking for my friends. after a few rounds of head turning, I saw my friend waving me down into this separate room.  This place looks pretty upscale due to the decor, however, the service is a far cry from being upscale. We constantly had to flag down a waitstaff (Even though the place seemed pretty empty) since they were just standing around doing nothing.  When we asked for something, they looked irritated as to not wanting to be bothered or that they weren't our waiter/waitress. It's just BULL!!! If their waitstaff were attentive, we wouldn't have to flag someone down to get some service.   So to the food. It was mediocre at best. The yellow and green curry were bleh. It was more like a soup. The pad thai wasn't as flavorful as I had wanted it to be. It was more on the bland side of the spectrum. The only dish that blew my mind was the Jun Pad Poo. The crab meat was fresh and big chunks at that.  This was the really bummer here. When you are done eating, you're setting yourself up for a dessert that you expect that a Thai Restaurant should have. SERIOUSLY! NO MANGO WITH STICKY RICE? wait wait . . . NO FRIED BANANA WITH ICE CREAM? WTFH!!! The server's response was \" We don't have mango with sticky rice. Oh we don't have fried banana with ice cream either. It's not in season right now so we don't have it.\" Everyone at our table thought . . . \"ARE YOU F-ing SERIOUS?\" So we decided to go even further and asked \"So what do you have?\" The response was, \"Oh we have just plain ice cream and roti\". To our disappointment, we just asked for the check so we can leave.   Overall, since they had a cheap lunch special. It was a cheap bargain. I'll be a little on the positive side and give them a 2 star. 1 got the nice decor of the place. 2 for the cheap lunch deal.  My advice is to test this place out during the lunch hour so you don't get charged more for something that you would've gotten for less. Who is to say, right? They might have something super good that will blow your mind, but so far for me, nothing stood out for me.",

Its not a great feeling to chow down on your food and then all of a sudden you feel the shell crunching against your teeth...the fried rice also had no flavor. We've had the beef jerky as well and every time it comes out super fatty. Like you can't even chew it. Sad. Last but not least, the only reason I kept ordering from here is because I crave fried bananas and everywhere else makes them hard on the outside (like egg rolls) while I like them to be fluffy. This is the only place I've found that makes them fluffy! The first time they tasted great, second time they tasted like rotten bananas were used, third time they were okay, and the last time not only did the bananas taste super nasty but the bread on the outside (or whatever it is) didn't even cover up the banana all the way. Very sloppy. Maybe one day I'll dine in or something..cuz I'm so tired of thai restaurants losing consistency!",

We were a party of two and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived.  We were seated in one of their tall backed booths near the stage they had setup for a guitar/vocalist (pretty decent).  There was a party of 12 in the middle of service and three other tables of three-four customers.   We waited at least 10 minutes after being seated as we saw three different servers working with the other tables.  I finally leaned out of the booth and waved to the manager.  He came to the table and became our server.  He even put on the black apron.  He was dressed in business attire while the servers all had their uniform on.    So the food was great.  We had the pork jerky that you dip in this great chili spiced dressing.  Chicken Larb (hot level 3) which was super tasty of citrus and heat and onions.  A really great pad thai with chicken.  There was a lot of flavor in this.  Some pad thai dishes are kind of bland.  Not this one.  Great green curry...sweet and spicy and creamy.  Again it was rich and flavorful.  The beef itself was pretty ick though.  It was overcooked.  Two for one SingHa beers made up for some of what was lacking.   Let's hope that no one else has as much trouble getting a server's attention, though.",

We usually eat at  Pho Little Saigon across the parking lot but was drawn in by the Thai food (both in a plaza near China Town). Krung Siam's decor was mostly wood and it was very dim at night, I couldn't see much but who's looking at each other when we're nose to plate w/ such good food?  We ordered satay, chicken krapow, crispy pork w/ chinese broccoli, and spicy catfish (pad ped pla dook). There wasn't one dish that I didn't fully enjoy. Everything on our table (except the glasses of water) was spicy, full of flavor, and just darn right satisfying. Every heaping spoonful of food that went into my mouth was a buddha-sent heaven, or hell since it's spicy, you know.  If you're asking if this place serves authentic Thai food, YES. Very authentic, so not everyone will be accustomed to the unusual and potent flavors. Is it affordable? YES. Will  I drive you there? Believe me, if I could I would haul every single reader into a giant container truck and drive there right now. Convinced yet?",

While having shots and chasing them with beers, we managed to snack on some of the food we ordered. I recall the food being flavorful and tasty. It allowed us to all drink more with food in our stomachs.   The staff was friendly and fun. Some of the staff actually remembered the people I was with from a previous visit there. The restaurant is large and has a full bar. They even have karaoke if you're brave enough to sing in front of strangers. Apparently from what the server told us, my friends were just extremely drunk last time and they couldn't pry them off the mics lol. Good drinks, tasty food and lasting memories. Fun spot!",

Unfortunately i won't be coming here anymore. Food is okay now, portions are MUCH smaller and they Falsely advertise prices online lower than what they charge you.  Tonight's order will be the last.  When I told the guy who gave me my food that the prices were different online he said something in Thai to another guy.  He then tells me, \"I told Mgr what you said and he says okay\".  How about sorry for mistake, or even we'll charge what is listed?? Nope.  Well it may seem trivial, but little things like what I've mentioned tick me off.  We are in a hospitality town and it baffles me how places act this way.  Oh well, it's probably better for my waistline that I don't order noodles at 2 am !!",

From the great service, amazing food and live music I fell in love. This place is the bomb. We always have to come to Chinatown when we want Thai food at night cause they are the only spots open late. But we found this place to try out and were so happy! The food was super tasty, fast and flavorful. We got pad Thai and Tom ka soup. We also got the spring rolls that were super yummy. We didn't have to wait more than 10-12 minutes for our foods. Which was awesome. The food was very filling and satisfying, it may not look like a lot but we didn't even finish our food.   Our server hands down was the best, like constantly refilling our drinks and checking up on us. Even other servers gave us refills. Like the service is of a 5 star restaurant, perfection. Best service I've had probably. We literally didn't have to ask for a refill or anything not one time. 10 stars for this place if could. We will definitely be back for sure. They even pack up your food for you if you want it togo instead of having you pack it which I love.  There's so many details that they do that just make it a great experience. MM is what his name said on the receipt but I didn't catch his full name.   They also had these really cool I pads that you can view pictures of all the items they had which we thought was really cool. It's nice being able to see pictures of items on the menu vs just a description. They also had live music playing, possibly  cause it's a Saturday night. He was singing in a different language I'm not sure what it was but it was very soothing and he was very talented. We loved the whole vibe of the place. This place is great for dates and such too. It's so nice.   Great place , 10 STARS !!! Go here lol",

It could be a little better. Also tried their crab fried rice and they give you a lot of crab in it which is awesome. Our server was friendly and took good care of us. I have tried their drunken noodle to go here as well and it was decent. I highly recommend their roast duck curry. Loved it.",

Otherwise I have learned my lesson that I will come back during the afternoon and not late night because the taste was so different that I could have been at another restaurant instead of 50 feet from where I sat my last visit here. Obviously being a different shift was another cook but tastes were nothing similar. The Tom khan soup had a fishy flavor, mushrooms were raw & they even took it back to the kitchen to add more coconut because the first serving had very little coconut milk in it. Even when it came back, it was not comparable to our last visit. The Penang curry was also less creamy than usual. Pad Thai was flavorless other than the scallions. Tonight earns 2 stars for food, but gave the extra star for the service.  So sorry for tonight's visit because this has been my late-night go to Thai place. Not sure if I will give their late night eats another try in the near future because I didn't enjoy one dish of the 3 we ordered.  I will return here during early afternoons but will be searching for another late-night restaurant.",

It's open late, I've never had to wait to be seated, the atmosphere is very clean and put together, the staff is always friendly (sometimes there is a language barrier but never had a mix up with my order), and the food is DELICIOUS!! The prices are a bit high but you get a lot of food and I've never been disappointed with the taste or presentation.  The ambiance is great for a little date night or hanging out with friends. If there is live music sometimes it can be a little loud but not too overpowering.   I used to go to a well known spot in the plaza next door but Krung Siam is a more intimate experience without the hassle.   P.s. try the pad Thai..your taste buds will thank me later!

If you have an appetite like me, you can eat until you're full and still have some take home to save and eat later.  Music: they mostly play covers of other songs but they are sooo good! Top 40s all the way to 90s. Great music taste. I'm also sure they have a live band and karaoke nights because there's a stage set up.  Space: the restaurant is huge! Great for intimate dates or large groups.  Parking: LOTS!",

We ordered garlic beef, duck fried rice, roast duck curry, and I ordered (because no one else wanted to try this) the papaya salad with raw blue grab and raw shrimp Laotian style with sticky rice and with a spice level of 3 (pro tip: always tone down the spice level when you get something Laotian style versus Thai style because Laotian style tends be for more dry than sweet like Thai so it usually will taste spicier Lao style). I liked everything but my party did complain that the food came out warm and wasn't hot enough. This didn't bother me since it complemented my cold papaya salad well.  But the service towards then end was lacking. It seemed like they forgot about us all together and took a really long time to get us dessert or bring our check. They were getting busy so I understand from a \"tipping\" standpoint, but from a review stand point just be more proactive about asking for dessert and the check.",

Another star was deducted because I was sitting there & saw a customer sitting in front of me dropped his jacket. Literally, 4 servers walked by & saw the jacket on the floor. None of them said anything to him & just walked by.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place yet since it is the best! This was one of the first restaurants my boyfriend and I tried when we moved to Las Vegas in 2011, and let me tell you it did not disappoint!   When we arrived (with a party of 7) for his 24th birthday, we were greeted and seated almost immediately. Earlier in the day I came by to drop off a birthday cake and some decorations and they waitress had them set up when our party arrived.  First thing ordered was Thai Ice Teas for the table. Which were amazing. Not too sweet, and not too strong, just perfect.  For appetizers we order 3 servings of the Thai beef Jerky. Very tender with just the right amount of spice.  My dinner selection was the shaved papaya salad (I ordered a 4 in spiciness) and it was crazy hot, but I washed it down with the tea ( the next time we visited I ordered a 3 and it was perfect).  The waitress brought a round of martinis to the table to commemorate the birthday celebration, and the person doing karaoke at the time joined us in singing happy birthday. It was an awesome night.  Pros:  atmosphere service food  cons: Parking lighting (it was a little on the dark side)  This review is from my first visit in 2012 and we have been back 8 times since. Definitely recommend!",

The food is solid but nothing to brag home about. Small portion sizes.  I know about thai town los angeles, and so i am a bit spoiled on my thai taste buds.  The best thing about this place is it's open late and it's simple. Ive eaten here 10x.   The worst thing about this place is that they play very loud music and pretend they are a cool bar, when no one else is inside. Which sucks because its late and I just want to eat and relax sometimes.  I will keep going here cause i eat laaaate... But i would never even consider coming here at any other time. There ARE 100%  many, many better thai spots around chinatown.",

    "text": "So i went to Krung Siam Thai at a random Wednesday night. We were planing to go to another Thai restaurant but it was already around 10pm, the one we planed to go close at 11pm. So we decided to go this Thai restaurant instead since it opens until 5 in the morning.   The restaurant has a wall of wine in front of the bar seat, and as i walk in more, there is a stage with a guitar. The atmosphere is good and the only bad thing is it is too dark. The table next to us used their phone's flashlight to see the menu.   We started with a Tom Yum soup with shrimp. We order 2 level of spicy out of 10, but it was not as spicy as we thought. Some thai restaurant's level two could possibly kill me... The Tom Yum soup comes in a metal pot. It has a bright orange color, the soup is clear and watery. They use cocktail shrimp, which is moist and tender. I like it better than those skinny shrimp that is usually used. The soup is a little spicy and sour with a kind of scent strong of lemongrass.  For appetizer, we had a raw shrimp and papaya salad. The raw slimy shrimp is one of my favorite thai dish. It is like a Thai sashimi but with a little piece of garlic and a green spicy chili sauce which makes it a high note dish. The shrimp is gummy, moist and rubbery. The shrimp itself is bland, but it goes well with the garlic and the sauce. The sauce is a little sour but very spicy. Next one is the papaya salad, the salad is made with green papaya, peanuts, tomatoes and carrots. The salad is very fresh and crunchy with a sweet, sour and spicy lime sauce. However, it is too spicy that i only had one bite of it.   For entree, we had a basil fried rice with pork. It has a very strong basil smell with a colorful appearance. The rice is soggy, grainy and a little oily. The pork is tender and smooth.  For a good ending, we ordered a mango sticky rice. Its bottom has a layer of sticky rice and top with a whole mango with some coconut sauce. Is rice is very gummy, soggy and creamy. The mango is not sour at all, which is quite sweet with the sweet coconut sauce. The coconut flavor is just right as it will not cover the taste of mango but goes well with it.   In conclusion, the food is tasty and the service is wonderful. As the salad is too spicy to eat, i drank a lot of water and they refill the water very quickly. And as we were ready to order, I looked at one of the server and he came immediately to take our order. In the middle of our meal, a performer went onto the stage and started to perform some nice song which makes our whole experience even better!",

    "text": "Before my family and I left this lovely, hot, humid place, we decided to come here to eat because someone was craving pho.  Like most Thai restaurants, the portions are huge and meant to be family style. Well I mean if you want to embrace 'murica then eat the whole dish by all means. No one is judging. Lol shit I would if I was hungry enough.  THE FOOD:  - Fresh Spring Rolls w/ Peanut Sauce - The sauce was good. I like my food spicy so I put a lot of that red chili sauce in it. The spring rolls were meh. Too much bean spouts so it lacked flavor unless I got some mint or something. I could make better ones at home.  - Chicken Satay - The chicken was juicy and  it was full of flavor. Definitely try it. You can't really go wrong with chicken satay.  - Seafood Rad Na - This is a dish I grew up eating since I was a little chubby fat girl waddling around. This Rad Na definitely did not disappoint and it had more seafood in it than other ones that I have had. It was flavorful, balanced, and oh so yummy! Mix it with some of those pickled jalapenos and you got yourself a winner!  - Basil Fried Rice - This. This made me regret ordering spring rolls. It was soooo good. None of the flavors overpowered one another and they put a lot of basil and bell peppers. We got the medium spice level because some people can't hang but it was still good. There was a little tickle of spice tingling my senses like the Taco Bell Fire hot sauce. So it was like a tease to my taste buds, then the spice was gone. I wish I could eat more right now. But god damn, carb overload.  Overall, food was great and service was on point. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be coming back to try some more food.",

Hubby and kids love the  crying tiger medium, so we ordered another one.   Here's what earn them a 3 star 1. we finish eating, the 2nd crying tiger order never came 2.  flag down the sweet smiling server following up on the missing crying tiger and to cancel it since it hasn't made its appearance .. she can't understand us and we patiently waiting for  the other server. she invetably spilled the cup she's holding and splattered on thefloor. (this didn't upset me), however she came back  with a wet.mop reeking of the fabuloso. . it was so strong that were gagging, luckily we were done eating or we would have lost it. 3. the spice tray was even offered to us, however saw them deliver to other tables.  Food 1.  Chicken panang - I asked for 8/10 spiciness. it was probably an 5 on my scale. a plus though is the lychee in it 2. chicken satay - good per my son's standard (he's a junior foodie)  3. combination pad Thai - we had better, kids said it tasted weird.  4. peanut sauce with chicken satay- good and warm  so.overall a comedy of errors.  will I come back? maybe not, Vegas has a lot to offer  and may only come back if my boys truly. crave the crying tiger.",

    "text": "This gem is located in China Town; On the corner of Spring Mountain & Valley View.  There is a Starbucks in the same plaza.  Great lunch special! A co-worker took me here last week for lunch.  I ordered: - Thai Iced Tea: first time having this.  It's very sweet but has an interesting flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  I would definitely order this again.  - Chicken Pad Thai: OMG!  Probably within my top 2 favorite Pad Thai's ever!  Not spicy at all, but great flavor, yummy chicken and I think fried tofu?  Delicious!  The lunch special says its served with soup, egg roll, fried wonton and salad.  We only got the soup.  The soup had some veggies and tofu in it.  Good flavor.  I'm kinda glad it didn't come with the rest, because I was stuffed after the plate of Pad Thai.  The plate is a generous portion, especially for lunch, but I finished it off like a champ, because it was that good.  The restaurant is very clean inside and everyone was very nice.  I can't wait to take my husband here!",

    "text": "So the \"oh crap\" feeling hit me the minute we walked into the restaurant & I noticed the majority of the diners were non Asian.  This is not good especially for a restaurant in Chinatown.  To me, that generally means the food is not authentic, that it is watered down for the American palette.  Coincidentally, My friend is white & she believes there is some truth to that.   We ordered the Chicken Larb salad, Garlic and pepper chicken & the drunken noodle, all medium spicy.  The food was okay.  Of the 3 dishes, only the drunken noodle packed a punch in the spicy dept.  The other 2 were barely hot.  The Lard salad & garlic pepper chicken were unremarkable & sort of bland.   The decor was very pleasant.  The servers were very nice, all smiles & stuff.  Excellent customer service was delivered to us.  Our server came over to check on us about 5 times, asking how we liked the food & if she could get us anything else.  We thought this level of customer service would not be found in your average restaurant in Chinatown where the primary clientele was Asians.  There, it is sit down, eat your food and get out lol",

Krung Siam is now and has always been one of our favorite lunch spots to go to when we're in town. The Pad Thai is one of the best and I swear I could drink a gallon of the soup served with lunch. Keep up the good work, we'll be back!  Now a place to avoid: Hollywood Thai. Even the owner calls his restaurant a \"dummy\" (I believe he means \"dump\" in broken English). Crappy food, bad location and no service (which the owner \"apologized\" for). Furthermore, if you bring in a groupon the owner admits he will serve you \"30% less food\" than other customers get.  And, the reason I bring this to your attention, the owner of H-Thai says his mother is good friends with the owner of Krung Siam but goes on to say, \"if you knew what happened to Krung Siam a month ago you would never go there\". I don't know and I don't care. A True \"friend\" never back stabs a fellow friend. And, as for Krung Siam, they've been good to us before, they were great on this visit and we look forward to seeing you again soon.",

This place has one particular dish, really does it for me - the red duck curry. It is the best curry I have had anywhere. as gross as it may sound, if you decide to try it, make sure to ask for no skin.  the beef salad with cilantro was excellent last night. our server was attentive and very nice. Pad thai was average in the past.  the red curry with duck is the bomb!  if you don't like duck, try it with a different meat. I will continue to visit this place just for that one dish.",

This was my first visit and what surprised me was that there was live music! Don't get me wrong, he was talented but since I was there on a first date, it made conversation somewhat difficult. My impression is that the entertainment only takes place during the later hours but my advice would be to call ahead to see what the music schedule is if you would like to have a quiet meal. All in all, a good spot but with the full bar and occasional entertainment, it just has more of a restaurant night club feel than I'm used to from a thai restaurant.",

The other issue I had was the customer service, my children are 8 and 6, without asking, the server lady immediately gave them plastic spoons and forks and plastic plates. When I asked if they can have metal forks bc those plastic ones aren't very sturdy , she said \"No\".  I asked her why, she replied \"they will break stuff\".  I think she meant I wanted plates to be porcelains ----I told her she can keep the plastic plates,but I prefer the metal forks.  She then has to go ask the manager then came back with them.

Which is what I like from Archi's Thai Kitchen. However, here I didn't note any heat. It bordered on being too sweet. Now, I know to choose on the higher end of the scale.   The pad thai had a mix of tofu and chicken. It had a heavy amount of red onion. It could've used more peanuts, and I prefer the crunch of fresh bean sprouts these were softened from being mixed into the noodles.  Service was great. Atmosphere is real nice. Lunch was $4.99, plus a buck for an iced tea. While it wasn't the greatest pad thai, but you can't beat the price. I think I'll skip the pad thai next time, but I'll return to try other lunch specials.",

Might have gotten the basil fried rice a little too spicy at around a 5 so I guess this place is really serious when it comes to spicyness!! Both the dishes were superb!  HOWEVER, the service was horrible to non-existent.  I am use to getting low service since I look young but mind you, I am 21 years old and my boyfriend is 22 so I really don't understand why we were ignored! Water was never refilled and since I ordered the spicy fried rice, I had to flag down the waiter three times to get my water refilled! The table only had one place setting when we sat down so we flagged down a waiter for a setting but instead just got a fork!!!! All the waiters seemed to go around the other tables to make sure they were doing fine but skipped ours. This was by far the worst service I have ever had. Maybe it was just a mistake/accident but I will definitely find another thai place that will serve the same quality food with better service.",

The pad thai was delivered before the appetizer, about which we had to remind them. There was no lime with the pad thai. When I asked for a slice, the waiter returned with a slice of lemon. The pad thai tasted off; the seafood was rubbery rings of calamari.  After struggling to get the waiter's attention, we paid the bill without finishing the meal and left.

    "text": "I had a very bad experience here while visiting Las Vegas with my family for the holiday.   When we arrive, we waited for about 15 minutes to be seated which is fine. First, they tried to sit us at a table. When we're standing near the table getting ready to sit, another waiter came over and told the hostess not to sit us there so we had to go back and wait again. 5 minutes later we finally sit down.   When getting our drinks, the waiter asks if we are \"local\". We found this odd because usually people as if we're visiting or not. What does it mattter if we're local? We tell the waiter we're visiting for the holiday. After getting our drinks, we're told to move again because someone just put in a reservation for 12 and they needed room.  While ordering, we specifically tell the waiter to bring out the appetizers first before the entrees. The table we had was small so we didn't want the clutter. My mother's Rad Nah dish comes out first anyways. We tell them to take it back and bring out the dish when we all get our entrees. The appetizers were papaya salad and thai beef salad. They taste ok but I've had alot better. When the entrees come out, we find that all the meat is not cook thoroughly in most our dishes. In my brother's pad thai, the imitation crab meat was not even cooked. It looked they threw the meat in straight from the package. After asking for the dish to be recooked, the pad thai comes back super sweet like someone dumped some high fructose corn syrup on the dish. The dish in inedible. My mother's dish also has meat that is under cooked. She just eat the noodles trying not to cause a fuss. My dish was ok. Crispy pork that was a little salty but at least edible.  Maybe if we told the waiter we were local, we would have been treated better. Since we're visiting and might not come back for a while, the restaurant acted like they didn't care about us.  In the end, we just went to In-N-Out Burger. They never disappoint like this mess of a Thai restaurant did.",

Here's a deal, I just really can't handle the lady singer at the restaurant so much. I just couldn't take just to listen to her anymore. Can someone really tell the owner about her that she can't sing. I couldn't breathe after heard her voice. I do like the guy singer tho, he is pretty good! pls pls pls dont' let her sing there again.",

    "text": "After searching a good amount of time for a place to eat off the strip, my friends and I settled on Krung Siam because of the reviews and proximity.  The place was nice inside as well as clean. Once we entered we were seated almost promptly. The menu appeared extensive and prices were a little too high I think for just Thai food off the strip but for sure cheaper than the Vegas strip food!  I thought perhaps portions would be larger due to the high prices when actually they are only moderate and marginal for family style dining.  We ordered the green curry with tofu, drunken noodles and Tom-kha kai soup dishes.  Price at the end for all three meals and drinks is about $38 (after 10pm is happy hour and it was advertised 15% off the total bill).  Service is very swift and it seems this place is popular since it was filled up but not packed.  At around 10:30pm or so a singer sang 80's music live on stage. Overall the food was good but too pricey, place is clean but seating area was too dim. The music can play a little too loud so I had a difficult time overhearing friends' conversations.",

    "text": "Well our experience was really all over the place and, honestly, I almost rated it two stars (**After writing the rest I came back and clicked the two star button, but I was originally going to give it a sympathy 3**).  Let's start by saying it was around 11:30 pm and the atmosphere was pretty cool.  It's a nice dining room with a nice feel (and open late!).  It was a Monday night (we had gone in search of Fuku, forgetting it was closed on Mondays), and Karaoke was happening.  So everything started out positively.  Our server was nice enough, but it was very inattentive service.  After a while, we ordered 3 dishes: Tom Yum Goon, Chicken Satay, and Rad Nar with chicken.  We ordered the Tom Yum \"Medium\" when he asked us how spicy.  We actually like spicy food, but weren't in the mood to really test our limits.  The \"medium\" was the spiciest Tom Yum we'd ever had (fine for me though it definitely had my nose running and gulping on my water), but my girlfriend couldn't hang and was disappointed.  Medium should have a good strong kick, and we wouldn't have minded if it was just Hot labeled medium, but this was REALLY hot.  Plus, the water was not getting refilled.  Our waiter disappeared completely during this time; eventually we were done with the soup and completely dry keeping our eyes peeled for him.  He must have been on break, because he eventually showed up with our Chicken Sate, room temperature.  Again, not completely a deal breaker-- It actually tasted pretty good and we are pretty used to Thai delivery/takeout where that's fairly par for the course.  However, one of the best things about actually going out for Thai food is that the Chicken Sate can be served absolutely piping hot.  In this case it was double fail, because not only was it room temperature, we suffered from not getting our water refilled that entire time.  Which brings me to the Rad Nar (flat noodles in gravy).  Again, I don't want to sound like a complainer, but when we order a noodle dish we want noodles.  It was strange, there was a very generous helping of the expensive ingredients beef and Chinese broccoli which I appreciate (for those of you paying attention to what we ordered and what we got, congratulations--again we like beef just fine, but come on, we ordered chicken, and when I mentioned we ordered chicken, the server just smiled and shrugged until my girlfriend said it was OK, we'd take the beef), but it was very skimpy on the noodles.  It made it a hard dish to share as we got like 3 flat noodles each.  So the meal itself was completely botched; that said, it was still pretty decent for late night Thai.  We won't be back if we find someplace better that's open at the hour, but the food itself was pretty decent/good-- even after getting everything completely wrong.    Oh and the epilogue; when we got the check the Tom Yum was marked 4-Star heat.  So that explained that.  I don't know how medium translated to that, but oh well.",

Service is mediocre.  We ordered rice with the tom yum soup which came out pretty quick.  Howeved, no one came to check to see if the rice came out.  We sat there for 25 min and my husband finally had to walk back  to the cashier to ask for the rice.  By that time, the pot got cold because the fire had gone out.  We had to ask for the waiter to add more gas to warm it up.  What a disappointment overall!",

    "text": "The wife and I were running errands around town, and our path was going to take us through China Town. We had both been craving Thai food, and because we were without a computer, we had to choose a place the old fashioned way, that is, we looked to see which restaurant had the most cars outside of it. Its hard to tell in China Town because it is just strip mall after strip mall, but there seemed to be many cars in front of Krung Siam and people going inside.  When we got in, we were pleasantly surprised. The decor was very modern, and I felt like we were in an upscale Asian restaurant in Chicago or New York. Additionally, from the looks of the lights and the sound set up on the inside, this place gets hopping after dark.   We were greeted by a very young looking hostess, and actually all the staff we saw were quite young, which was just not what we are used to in this part of town. On to the food! I got the Pad See Uw with Tofu and the wife got pineapple fried rice. We also both got Thai Iced Tea. The tea was not as sweet as I've had other places, which was very nice. The spices were more prominent, and the flavor was bold, but not overpowering. My dish was amazing. I think its probably the best tofu I've had in a while. It w as fried, but not over fried and the black soy sauce filled the pores of the tofu. It was nice and firm, but not too crunchy. The noodles were also cooked perfectly. I could have eaten them by themselves. The veggies were also cooked well, not too stiff and not soggy. The wife's lunch was also very good. All the veggies and fruit was very fresh, and including raw cashews and unsweetened raisins really completed the meal. It was flavorful but not too sweet and not too salty.   The price was very reasonable. Less than at our other Thai haunts. We paid about $22 for the 2 entrees and 2 Thai teas. Not bad at all.   If I could give Krung Siam a 3.5 I would, but I will round up to a 4. I am excited to come back to this place.",

What happened, I'm not sure but it feels like they change chef or something.   I went there for lunch on MDW ordered Pat Se-ew, my favorite dish and they informed us there is no chow- phun noodles.  WTH, really its 11:45am and you ran out of the noodles for your most popular dish?  So then I proceed to order a beef salad, and it was the saltiest dish they could have made!. Everything was drench in salt, even my tomatoes were salty!  My friend ordered pineapple fried rice and it was wet and clumpy.   My  boyfriend ordered  a bowl of tomyum soup, and that was the only dish that tasted great. Maybe they have a different chef that works during lunch hour and one at night.  When I came to Krung Siam in the past, it had always been at night, where the food tasted out of this world and the live music created such a nice ambiance.",

My friend's Thai, and I'm Taiwanese (yes, we are from different countries).  Anyways, this was the first time for both of us there, so we had the waiter give us some recommendations for what to order.  As soon as he told us the crab fried rice was good, we both glared at him and give him the \"oh come on, do you want to just show us where the nearest panda express is?\"  So after he embarrassingly apologized, and my friend started to speak Thai, he recommended something, and that was when my friend got very excited, which got me excited (although I really have no clue why).  My friend said they got some kind of squid with spicy dipping sauce, and it's really good.  So we put in the order, along with some kind of specialty beef noodle soup and an order of mixed vegetable.  In all honesty, my friend put in the order, and I was just going along for the ride!  I am the Thai food apprentice =)  When the squid was served, my jaw almost dropped! And the reason was, on the plate were two giant grilled squid.  And why my jaw dropped? Because this is the first place I've ever been to that served grilled squid like the way you find it from street carts in Asia!  The squid were grilled to perfection, slices into rings, tentacles and all!  The dipping sauce was good, and the only way I can describe it is a thick kind of spicy fish sauce. YummmmOOOOO!  The beef noodle was excellent too (after my friend mod it to the spiciness of our preference).  Its a none creamy sweet and spicy dark broth with green veggies, beef meat balls, beef tendons and steaks, and bean thread noodles.  The bowl is huuuuge, enough to serve 2 to 3.  The most mediocre thing we ordered was the stir-friend mix veggies.  Its just your everyday stir-fried mix veggies with chili peppers.  But we gotta get those veggies in somehow =)  The order was kinda small comparing to the other dishes.  For dessert, we ordered Roti (Indian pancake) with condensed milk drizzled all over.  You can never go wrong with that! We also got the fried bananas.  We were expecting it to be egg-roll wrapped then fried.  Instead, its thickly battered and fried.  The batter also had shredded coconut in it, the aroma was nice, and the taste was good, but overall just taste like banana in a giant donut hole.  If you're not into fried food, like we weren't, don't order it.  All in all, we'll definitely come back again, especially for that grilled squid!!   We heart Krung Siam!",

When we didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to dine on The Strip, we'd just hop on over here.  Last year, I even had my Wedding Rehearsal Dinner here because the place is fairly nice, the food is good, and it's a great bang for the buck.  Well, now I drop down to just two stars for this reason alone:  They upped the prices at least $5 per item for the exact same food, atmosphere, quality, service, etc.  Nothing about the restaurant has changed, in my eyes, except for the price.  The portions didn't change...nothing.  It irks me that a place thinks they can up their prices drastically just because they're trying to be slightly more high-end.  I think I paid something like $13 for Yellow Chicken Curry.  Something I can get for $8 at any other Thai restaurant of the same caliber elsewhere.  Service wasn't even good to make up for the increased prices.  The place was empty and I felt like we waited a little long to place our order, for the food, and to pay the check.  For this price, we could've just stayed on The Strip and dined in one of the casinos or malls.  I admit, yes, the food is still good but it doesn't warrant paying the increased prices.",

The food was good, Pad See ew was a solid B+ and the Thai barbecued chicken was good but some pieces were a little dry. We also had the Tom Kha (sp?) which was perfect just the right amount of spice and not too milky. Finally someone got it right when they ask you what kind of spicy level 1-10 and you say 6. I know it's subjective but usually restaurants either have it at a 1 or 10 no matter what number you pick. The decor and bar was nice, looks like it could be a good place for karaoke.

    "text": "My experience was at late night dinner at midnight.  We arrived there and was immediately surprised that they turned the restaurant almost into a night club atmosphere. Dim lights with party lights, a fog machine and a DJ. The bass was really pumping through your bodies... good or bad depending how you're feeling. We were promptly seated and ordered drinks and received them almost immediately, along with our plates and utensils.  The decor of the place was really nice, actually. It was very modern for a Thai place. But besides from that, you might have to wait a long time for your dishes to come out during the late night hours. Luckily I have a patient boyfriend, so we managed to get our food. I saw another couple walk out though because they couldn't wait any longer. I don't blame them.  We waited probably about 30-45 minutes for our food, and our entrees came before our appetizer! We found this odd, but we were hungry so we just ate. - Beef Satay: This came in the middle of our entrees, but this dish in particular was worth the wait. Beautifully presented, tender with a delicious peanut sauce. My boyfriend took the cucumber to cool his mouth down when he was eating his curry ;) - Pad Thai: It started out good, with the right amount of meat ratio with tofu thrown in. However, at some point near the end (bottom of the plate) it started to taste spoiled?! I don't know how, but it did and I couldn't finish the rest of it. - Yellow Curry (Spice Level 10): My boyfriend asked for this, and don't try this if you do not have a high spice tolerant. My boyfriend wanted to be challenged, and he was sweating profusely and his face was all red. He was clinging onto his Thai Iced Tea and water like it was his best friend. But other than that, he thought it was good. Check was about $30 for the 3 dishes and 2 drinks during Happy hour. Good deal!  Overall: Dishes are kind of hit-and-miss and service is a little bit spotty. If you come during the late night hours, expect a night club atmosphere with long wait times.",

I love this place because it's reallllly good but the many times I've been here conquer the times I actually had pretty bad service since I've found a worm in my curry and have gotten food poisoning here. Don't get me wrong it's a good place to eat if you're looking for great communication and vibe because they have singers that come in at night so it's a dinner and a show. The friendly service made me come back to be quite honest because the food is good and they way they treat you is spot on. After I found a worm in my food, they kindly offered to re-make the food for me or take it off the check. But which made me happier was that they offered to pay for my next dish free which was nice. The Rad Na was good but I think the meat was undercooked, that's why I got food poisoning.. in the end I will and forever will come back to this place it deserve a 3rd chance. If you want to find a good and a holy grail Thai restaurant I recommend this place.",

Their prices are reasonable, and they also offer a lunch special (I'm unsure of when). The Pad See Ew with tofu is my favorite, although I've never had it, my sister raves of their papaya salad. As many other thai restuarants, they offer you to chose a spice level from 1-10, and sometimes they can make something a tad too spicy, so spice with caution. They also give you little condiments to add more spcie if needed.",

Their yellow curry, the taste, I can still recall to this day. Their Thai iced tea may not have tasted as good as other places but I didn't mind. Our drinks were refilled on a timely manner and our server was very attentive. We didn't need to call out to him because he checked up on us without fail.

The food came out less than 7 minute for 5 dishes. (Sorry! no pics, bf's dad was hungry and dig in) Anyways, here the break down.....  1.) Pad thai = 2/5, about $11 or so, small portion. too sweet. noodle wasn't the right one for pad thai. 2.) Pad see you/ew? idk how to spell it properly : 3/5 (best dish out of all) cost like $10 3.) Seafood fried rice = tasteless......cost like 10 dollars or so. 1/5 4.) Krung Siam platter. I believe it was 15 DOLLARS!!! LET ME TRY TO remember....what it had....2 eggrolls, 3 crab puff, 3 wonton, 2 satay chicken....so expensive, and it didn't even taste good!! Idk, why they order it..... 1.5/6  6.) Beef Salad. Beef taste so hard and dry. Smells strong for some reason. We didn't finish that dish  Thai Tea tastes like bottled ones where u can get at the super market. hot tea is about 2 dollars and iced tea is about 2 dollars.  Wish the people who came with me didn't suggest thai food blah.  Sorry if my typing is messy. I'm typing this around 1:30 am half asleep. HAHA",

The soup was a perfect balance of sweet coconut milk and curry flavor. Not too sweet and not too curryish. The duck was good although there was alot of skin included. My father ordered the Thai BBQ which came out fajita style  the bottom of the Cornish hen was slightly burnt due to the hot iron but the flavor was still excellent. Also the raspberry sweet tea is especially good. Overall I'd say that this was a great first Thai experience. The food great and the service excellent.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I used to come here from time to time since it was open late and I often crave thai food. The last experience we had would keep us from ever going back.   A few weeks back, my boyfriend and I went to have a late night dinner and a drink. Upon arrival, we waited for a table to be cleaned so that we could be seated. It wasn't at all that busy but the servers were really slow. Once we were seated, we noticed a table beside us that was still waiting to be cleaned, and probably a few others as well. Make a side note of that.   Anyway, we picked our drinks and food and awaited a waiter. We finally snagged one and asked if we could order our drinks. They had told us that someone would be able to get to us shortly. Waiting patiently, a waiter finally came by and took our order. We then waited for about a good 10-15 mins for our drinks until we asked the waiter where they were. He said he would check. Drinks finally came and I didn't particularly like them so I gave them both to my boyfriend. As he was drinking it I noticed something floating in the drink. I then grabbed my phone to use as a flashlight to see what was it was. THERE WERE 3-4 BUGS IN THE DRINK. Still kicking and moving around. DISGUSTING. The fact that we had taken a few sips from the drink itself completely appalled me. We returned BOTH the drinks and asked for a manager. The manager, who had actually made and delivered the drinks, had tried to convince us that they were seeds probably. Uhm, seeds don't have legs and there aren't seeds in the drinks that we ordered.   The manager was very apologetic and paid for one of our meals. Still unforgiving, we wrote a little note on the receipt, didn't tip, and left knowing we would never come back. Oh, and that table beside us that was never cleaned... Never got cleaned up the entire time we were there.",

They have so much varieties in Spring Roll - these fresh ones were liked by my entire family. i could bring all the way   from LV to MCO..what an amazing. there was no issues. Some of the Salads they give as a side was awesome- my family loved   it. Sometimes we have to speak their language, which is tough i guess:) Just kidding. otherwise it was so late and this is   the best closest to Fairfield Inn near Mandalay resort or Dean Martin -.. Please check out-. One great thing they are open so late . I dont think anywhere you can find such thing.",

Thai Iced Tea is $1.00 during their lunch special too which can't be beat.  My favorite entrees are the Pad Thai or the Drunken Noodle. Yellow curry isn't bad either.  When it's not lunch special time, entrees are pretty pricey. The pad thai and/or pad-see-ew can be at least $9.99 but they open until 4am-6am which means they are always an option to eat at.   Will recommend for lunch specials and be kept in my book",

It was hard to have a conversation in such close quarters, but the live band kept us entertained and we shortly got our entrees after.  Drunken noodles: pick your choice of meat and spice. We got chicken in medium spice. There were plenty of bell peppers, chicken, and tomatoes...but where's the noodles? I was a little disappointed for not having enough noodles. But it was flavorful and had a perfect amount of spice and plenty of leftover meat and veggies after the noodles were gone!   Thai chicken: when the server brought it out, he poured some liquid over it to make it sizzzzle! Talk about dinner and show! And it came with two dipping sauces, one was a sweet chili sauce and the other had a spicy/fish sauce/lime taste to it. The chicken was juicy and tasty by itself! But the sauces did elevate the flavors and give it that Thai twist!   Spring rolls: I didn't realize they weren't the fresh kind. It was the fried egg rolls filled with noodles and vegetables. It also came with a delicious dipping sauce that was different from the sweet chili sauce given to us with the chicken. It was my favorite of the three sauces we got! They also cut the spring rolls in half, but they're as big as normal sized eggs rolls.   I love how they're open late and not too far from the strip. Great place to grab food after work. And I did see a beer tower advertised for $18 all day! A lot of people ordered pad thai and fried rice when I went, so I'm gonna go back and give that a try!",

My favorite is fresh spring roll, Tom Kha (coconut milk) soup, any entrees with Tofu (especially spicy eggplant and spicy basil.) I highly recommend anyone who would like to eat healthier to substitute their usual meat options for tofu...it's very satisfying and very much tasty! Oh, and I cannot forget to mention my favorite young coconut drink, which comes in the shell and very fresh, for only $4!!!! The ambience is modern and hip though very comfortable and all their staff are very nice and friendly.  Sometimes, there is live entertainment going on, usually with the guitarist who has a great voice, and every now and then, your server might even go up on the stage and start singing! Lastly, it is just an awesome late night spot for the night owls like myself...and did I mention the food is yummy here?!!",

    "text": "After partying in Vegas, food always sounds good.  Actually, food is always good.  We were craving Thai and one of my good friends from the area suggested this since it's open late and not too far from the strip.  I ordered the Thai BBQ chicken.  My gf got the Panang Curry.  My friend got this pork belly dish sauteed in some Chinese broccoli.  The Thai BBQ chicken comes on a sizzling plate.  The server then adds some liquid to the plate and the plate flames up.  It's a pretty cool sight to see.  And my chicken was piping hot throughout my entire meal, which is always good.  Cold chicken isn't always the tastiest, right?  The Panang Curry with chicken at Level 7 spice was really good.  Spicy food after some drinks hits the spot.  Level 7 can be a bit too spicy for others, but it was bearable.  Would definitely get this.  The Sauteed Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli was so good.  The pork belly was crispy and flavorful.  The sauce it was in was just right and didn't make the pork belly all soggy.  For some reason, it's dark in here.  One could definitely have trouble eating in the dark.  Okay, not really, but it is pretty dark in here.  There's also karaoke.  And a full bar.  Another table even ordered a whole bottle of liquor to go with their food.  Better than the thousands people drop for a bottle at the clubs in Vegas, right?  Ha.  Good place for some food for sure.",

Okay, lets skip all the ridiculous intros and get into this review  This place was really appealing to me for some odd reason.  A cool mechanical waterfall when you enter the restaurant, dimly lit, neon everywhere, a stage for live music and waitresses walking around with bunny ears? Definitely a place different from where I normally eat at but I do enjoy the charm.   Service: Was absolutely great!  The guy we had was very cordial, made sure our glasses were always full (big plus) and was very pleasant.  Towards the end of our meal, the manager took our leftovers and personally placed them into individual boxes (YES!).   Food: The sauce that accompanies a lot of the dishes I got the spring rolls which were perfectly crunchy and flaky without destroying the contents.  The drunken noodles were a yelp favorite? but really wasn't that great.  It was like a 80:20 ratio of vegetables/meat to noodles and the noodles were more like sheets.  The Thai BBQ chicken gets  flambed which is pretty freaking cool but make sure you move the chicken off the plate and onto your plate or else it'll burn the bottom.  The fried rice and pad thai looked good so i'll definitely will get those next time.   Music: We had a guy playing a guitar while we were eating which was pretty charming.    Overall: Great place to eat whether it be afternoon or late night.",

Also, the ambiance was a relaxing touch; the decor inside is quite modernized.   I ordered the Drunken Noodle with seafood, as well as the Kao Man Kai, which my waitress recommended. The Drunken Noodle was very delicious; it was flavorful, the seafood was juicy and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Every ingredient belonged in the dish, and I would gladly eat it again.   The Kao Man Kai, a chicken dish served with rice and a warm broth, was also a very strong dish. My only criticism was that the chicken was maybe a bit too dry, though the broth certainly helped wash it down. The rice, as simple as it was, complimented the chicken and broth very well; I was impressed by the presentation of the plating. Very tasteful all-around.   I highly recommend this restaurant for those who are big fans of Thai food. It is a very worthwhile place to dine out and experience.",

Just a stone's throw from The Strip on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View, Krung Siam is a hip and cozy place in bustling Chinatown.   We enjoyed: . Thai Beef Jerky - Deep fried with a spicy chili sauce; . Spring Rolls - Very light and crispy rolls filled with noodles, black mushrooms and assorted vegetables;  . Green Chicken Curry (spice level 5) - A rich and delicious curry of coconut milk, peas and carrots, bamboo shoots, and tender chicken served with jasmine rice.  Cool atmosphere, a polite and attentive staff, and very reasonable prices, Krung Siam is a great place in Las Vegas for authentic Thai food. Locals and tourists, I promise you won't be disappointed!",

There are a couple of places that I make sure I visit when I'm there and this is at the top of the list.   I love spicy food and on their 1-10 scale you're taking your life in your hands at anything above a 6, but even if you go really spicy you still taste the food. I've never been disappointed in anything I've had here, I can speak only of noodle and beef and chicken dishes but others in my group have spoken well of other dishes. It's not too pricey I think our last bill was around $60 plus tip which is good for 4 people.   One more thing I wanted to point out,  on nights we were there there has been times where a guy that rocks the easy listening tunes with an acoustic guitar entertains the crowd and I love it.",

It consisted of tofu, bamboo shoots, diced carrots, peas, rice and and a very light green curry broth. It would not surprise me if the the peas and carrots were canned, it was a simple dish. I would have given a better review if the curry cost a few dollars less. Not much taste and soggy tofu. The mango and sticky rice is a large portion for $7.99, but It definitely didn't need a rotten mint leaf garnish. The mango was good and there was a lot of it. Good points- it has great ambience, entertainment, and is very clean. It just seems that food quality and fresh ingredients are not a top priority at Krung Siam. $20 before tip for green curry and a mango sticky rice dessert.  Strike one for me.",

    "text": "I believe that good food should massage the palate, please the tongue, and warm the soul.  I got all of that in my meal at Krung Siam. Was it the best curry that I've ever had? Almost. Mix Zone Three Color FTW!  I popped in here for a quick lunch, only because I saw a sign that said $4.99 lunch special. I figured, why not.  I took one star off from this review for two reasons (and these can easily be remedied):  1. I was not offered water until several minutes. It's 113 degrees outside. I was jonesin for a glass.  2. The lunch special includes the soup of the day, and they ran out by 2pm (lunch ends at 3).   I ordered the Panang Curry with Shrimp (a dollar more than the special price).  The curry was flavorful, and the portions were appropriate for lunch. The menu is pretty diverse, and you have lots of great options. When I come back, I'll explore.  The ambiance is pretty cool. Dark, nicely air-conditioned, and clean. The place seems fairly new. Flat screen TV's and sparkly christmas lights fall from the ceiling.  There is a stage, where they seem to have karaoke and other forms of live entertainment. Decent Happy Hour. Half off drinks from 3-7 M-F.  One last note...this place is open until 4am. Might be a good spot for late night post-club grub. Just a thought.  In summary? Good spot. Possibly great.",

Much like many Asian restaurants, their lunch specials are ridiculously affordable (I believe $5.99 for a small soup and entree). Unfortunately, the service is akin to most of its Asian brethren as well. Which is to say, it is very hit, miss, or indifferent. Krung steps up the decor more than most plain jane Asian joints, which is a welcoming edition. Overall, if you want a satisfying Thai experience that is easy on the wallet (especially during lunch), give Krung Siam a whirl. And tell them Judas sent you! (That will probably give you the same indifferent response than if you told them, \"Never fake the funk on a nasty dunk.\")",

I love their Pad Thai and their Panang Curry. Both very good and they're not stingy w/ the meats that they put in them. The Beef Jerky is good and flavorful. The Larb is so good, but I've yet to find  a Thai place where its not. I wasn't a fan of their sticky rice, but hey every restaurant has it's downfalls. One thing that I loved about this place and it wasn't on the menu was that I was really craving Duck Noodle Soup and saw they served duck on the menu, they made it for me when I asked for it and that was just the cherry on top! Other than that I like this place and would definitely return.  It has a dark setting on the inside, is open late and sometimes they have live music.",

    "text": "Okay I never give a bad review but this time I have to due to VERY VERY BAD SERVICE.   So my coworkers and I came down here for our lunch break, walk in, it's a little busy was a nice clean restaurant. While we were standing waiting for someone to seat us, servers just pass us by not saying a word to us. We waited for about 10 minutes and still no one approached us so my coworker goes to the bar and tells them. Then a guy grabs the menus and just starts walking (keep in mind he doesn't even say a damn word to us) so we followed because he must be seating us. 10 minutes pass by and still no one to take our orders (I would of walked right out but we were on lunch and very hungry). So in order for us to order we had to get up and give them our order while not once did they come to get our order or even check up on us. So we asked the person at the bar who is our server and it was a young lady! We were so pissed off because here she goes to the table next to us who just got seated and she already gets their orders, then she looks at us and walks away doesn't even say hi or have you been helped. Anyway, with that being said it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out....our lunch was ruined had to go back to work by the time we got our food.   The food is good and not bad for $4.99 lunch special and $1.00 Thai tea!   Very very bad service and I am probably not the only one that experienced it because there were a bunch of angry people that just walked out. For example: there were two guys having lunch and oh my were they mad because apparently they forgot the other guys order and only brought one order out. They just walked out without paying! Hey I don't blame them because I would have done the same thing!",

SO flavorful. my order was a to go order and they DID give me the things that a to go order needs to have, the ONLY reason why i didn't give them 5 stars is because the rice container wasn't packed in like everyone else does. the order cost $17 but man o man, that was some good stuff. my advice, DON'T pay attention to the bad reviews, this place is good. i'll be back fo shizzle.",

They had a singer that night and he lent a nice touch to dinner; we declined to be seated next to the stage as it would've been uncomfortably loud.   Can't say it was the best or most authentic Thai I have had - but service was good, portions were fair but I thought prices were high for the the food we got.  They also have a bar area but we didn't imbibe that evening.",

    "text": "Had dinner here the night before. Wasnt really crowded and it looks as if karaoke was on the agenda for the night.  The menu is a bit limited, at least in my opinion, for a thai restaurant. The pricing and limited menu didnt look like it would play well with conventional asian family style communitive dinner.  The beef salad was by far the best tasting item we ordered during this meal. It was nicely seasoned and grilled to order so it had that fresh off the grill smokey, concentrated, burnt taste.   Krung Siam platter is...quite...insulting to be honest. 13 hard earned dollars for two of everything:   Two satays one chicken one beef both lacking the fresh off the grill smokey flavor, seems more like broiled, chicken was overly dry. Sauces were there obviously to cover up this fact.  Spring rolls: more like miniature egg rolls with bland tasteless filling. Another excuse to show off the sauces or serve something deep fried, or both.  Fried Battered Shrimp: tasteless with more deep fried flavor then shrimp flavor. Might as well deep fry presoaked and reshapened cardboard if you have a deep fry fetish be a lot cheaper too  Thai Dumplings: Best thing on the plate but seriously not thai. Not even close unless Dim Sum started in Thailand and the Chinese came, knocked out the Thai, stole their food and the Thai woke up and completely forgot about it.  Crab Ragoons: Again i have a problem with this. Crab implies fresh crab, a little guy with two pinchers, a bunch of claws and sweet sweet meat. Krab is a biproduct of liquefied, reshapened, reseasoned and food colored crap (yes crap not krap). Anyway no surprise here it had a heavily deep fried taste, very little texture from the Krab, lots and lots of cream cheese. Here's an idea why not just bread and deep fry cream cheese?  Okay enough of that lets move on to the main courses: Panang Curry Quite nice. Ordered mild and everything was nice, flavorful, and mellow until i started fishing pieces off the bottom. Diced up chilis were waiting for me leaving my mouth burning and attempting to chill the flames with the coconut/peanut sauce from the sampler.  Beef Fried Rice Yeah we can call epic fail on this one. Your basic very very dry not seasoned very well, wth is wrong with this beef it's colorless and tasteless fried rice.  The last complaint is the insulting price to food ratio. the sampler was 13.99 with only 7.99 worth of food. Both the rice and the curry were a decent size for one person but not filling.  Overall i can only give this place three stars. It's just too much money for too little food. This would be a place to take a date but not a place for serious eating",

    "text": "Wanted to try a new Thai place and ended up here with a friend.  The restaurant is in China Town.  It was an afternoon, maybe around 2:00 so not rush hour lunch but there were not a lot of people eating in the restaurant.   I ordered Thai Basil which sounded great to me but when I got it I discovered red peppers in it which I do not like at all. I love Chili's and spicy food but I can't eat red peppers.  I am not sure if that is written in the description on the menu but I didn't notice it and when the food came....I could not eat it do to the red peppers.  I tried to push it off on my friend who told me he's not a fan either of peppers.   So, he got the pad thai and I tasted it and decided to order the same thing.  The server/waitress never asked if anything was wrong with the dish that we weren't eating.  We never mentioned it either.   Personally, it seems the staff probably should have at least noticed that one appetizer and 2 entrees were ordered for 2 ppl and then a 3rd entree ordered with one not ever touched.    Anyway, the food was not bad, pretty tasty. I would not go out of my way to return however...",

The last time we came to Chinatown, we chose a different Thai place, and decided to come back and knock Krung Siam off the list.  Very glad we did.  It was packed but we were seated promptly.  I didn't see my favorite dish (Pad Prik King) on the menu, so I asked them if they had it.  They did!  It hadn't made it to the menu yet, but it was available for order.  So glad I asked.    Food, service, atmosphere, wine list, all 4 stars.  I'm very happy we finally checked this place out, especially given there are a couple other Thai restaurants in town that we already love to frequent.  Now, Krung Siam is in the rotation.",

I came in for a quick lunch with my dad and the sign stated that the week of Christmas and New Years, they didn't have lunch specials, which was the main reason we came. Both of us were freaking starving, so we just decided to stay.  We pretty much got there right when they opened so service was good. They were pretty attentive and kept refilling our drinks. That's a good sign. Now on to the food.  Crab rangoons This is one of my favorite things to order for an appetizer. I was really disappointed. We were the first ones in the restaurant so I expected them to come out hot and fresh. Nope, these were just warm like they were  made 20 mins before and just sitting. When I opened one, you could see how greasy it was.   Chicken panang I enjoyed this dish a lot. Big chunks of chicken and chunks of bell peppers. It was really good, like what panang is supposed to taste like, but the portion was really small for the $10 price. I could have just eaten that myself.   Beef larb I'm not a fan of their version. Instead of using chopped pieces of beef, they used ground beef. They use cabbage instead of lettuce like I'm used to at other places. To me this dish reminded me of another Filipino dish called papaitan (spelling?). For anyone who knows who that is, you know that distinct taste I'm talking about. Not really pleasant in Thai food.   Overall, I had a decent experience here. I'd come here if someone else was paying, but I'll stick to other Thai places around town.",

I wanted to call in to order my food so by the time I arrived the food would be ready since I was on a time crisis! The lady on the phone said the restaurant was busy but said that's not a problem! We arrived and the place only had two tables being occupied so I'm not exactly sure what her definition of busy is! But overall the food was goooood, the service was friendly! Atmosphere is dark and they have a live band! The bathroom is a bit scary! Overall not too bad and the food was good and tasty! This place also opens really late with a bar!",

A look to the public health website shows they have bad a rocky past with being able to get A ratings.. even sometimes getting Cs.    It worries me quite a bit about their food safety so I'm not sure if i will be returning.   It's just not worth getting food poisoning.  The food really does taste amazing though.",

Thai is now one of my favorite go to places, and I always order the same thing: Tom Yum soup, Pat See Eww (can't spell these right), combo fried rice and a Thai tea to wash it all down. Although none of the places I've been to (hundreds) have come close to that first place, this is pretty close.   I've now been coming here religiously since 2012. They've changed it up quite a bit over the years but the food is always on point and the customer service always exceeds expectations.",

After looking at reviews I was expecting bad service, but the service actually ended up being pretty good. The problem was the food. I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with Tofu and my sister got the Curry Shrimp. We also shared a cucumber salad. The prices were okay and the place looked nice.  But they had very loud customers there that acted as if they owned the place. But the worst part and the reason I am giving it 2 stars is because the food got me sick. I even had some leftovers thinking my upset stomach could have been from something else. But as soon as I touched the leftover, I felt bad immediately so I threw the leftovers away.  Not sure if the food is not fresh or what but I cannot recommend this place, unless you want to get sick. Good service is the only thing keeping this place from receiving a 1 star review.",

    "text": "One of my buds who really knows good cuisine says this is one of the best Thai food spots in Vegas. The Yelp rating of 3.5 kinda threw me off but everyone has their own opinion. I'm no expert in Thai food but everything Krung Siam threw at me was really good.  Located near Chinatown in Vegas, Krung Siam is kind of low key especially with a sort of saturation of restaurants in the area. Inside, you can tell they're doing some renovations. The seating consists of one long booth with two chairs on the other side of the table. Interesting. But hey, enough about asthetics.  We started with spring rolls and the crispy fried pork belly. Both were served piping hot. The rolls were great (especially with mild sweet & sour sauce) I could have just ate the pork belly. Man, it was phenomenal. And whatever chili sauce was included. Ooh wee! For entrees we shared Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp fried rice, Pad Z-U & Beef Basil. Everything was outstanding. One complaint. All that food and they give you one small bowl of rice for all of it ($2 for additional small bowls). C'mon man. Service was excellent. I drink a lot of water and they kept my glass filled. And the water glasses are small so they were probably tired of seeing me lol.  Krung Siam is a place I'd definitely return to. The food and service were excellent and the inside will no doubt look amazing when it's done. One thing I forgot to mention is they are open from 11:30am-6am. Great for late night/early morning eats. Definitely recommended.",

Every Thai restaurant that I have ever eaten asks one important question. \"How many Stars\" or hot would you like it. I guess he assumed that myself and my guests couldn't handle the heat even after I asked for a chili. We had their drunken noodles, lard gai, and their \"must have\" crab fried rice, which should read must pass. They had some entertainment a soloist that was playing music to their iPad. Not bad stuff except the volume was insane. Hey some people might like that as it helps take their mind of the food and service. You can do better!",

We waited ten minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant with maybe 4 tables and another 10 for someone to come by and get our drink order. Then I watched our food come up and sit at the window for another 10 (I knew it was ours since we were the only people without food in the restaurant). The saving factor: the food was amazing. Like 10/10 sooo good I could lick the bowl clean. We got the Tom Ka soup, spring rolls, pad Thai and green curry and I would recommend all of that all over again. So will I go back? Probably not, I'll just call in and get take out.  *also notice the giant flame coming out of the soup sitting on the top small plate. Definitely a fire hazard so no small children if you're going to order this!",

The hallway on the long journey through the maze to get to the bathroom is cool too! I liked the shiplap walls and ceiling in that hallway the most.   But who care about how the place looks! How does the food taste?!? Well we started with the beef jerky, which was pretty good, but surprisingly did not come with sticky rice... It is available at extra cost. The crazy wings were really good. They were just the right amount of crispy and juicy. The shrimp sashimi is really good and the raw garlic on it takes it to the next level, so long as you aren't trying to kiss someone afterwards.  Moving on to the main course, the pad Thai here is very good, it was perfectly cooked so the noodles we're long and didn't break into tiny pieces. The crab fried rice had generous chunks of lump crab in it, and the basil chicken with egg was great, except it would have been much better if the egg was over easy instead of over hard.   The only issue I really had was that nothing came with rice. There is a surcharge for rice here. So dishes like the Tom yum, basil chicken, and the beef jerky that come with rice at every other Thai place, come with nothing here. And rice is charged here at 2 bucks per person per serving.   All in all, krung siam is an above average Thai restaurant. Great service, amazing decor, very clean, but we were a bit turned off for the rice charges.",

Plus service is good.   We had drunken noodles and lettuce wraps.   The lettuce wraps were juicy, tasty and just all around solid.   The pad ke mao (drunken noodle) was not bad. More tomato that I prefer but pretty solid. The beer was bottled and good as beer should be.   Bathrooms are in back through a hallway and the whole place is relaxed. Nothing about it feels upscale just good food, beer and music every night.",

We were waiting on a friend to arrive so we decide to order drinks first but informed by the waiter we should order due to food might take a while to come out and tell us phone our friend to order thru phone so he can put in his order too. Lol! But of course we didn't do so cause he know nothing about Thai food.   Drunken noodle was good. Avoid padseew cause noodle was falling apart like its better eat it with a spoon.  There's this weird smell in the beef fried rice I think due to either not so fresh beef or old scrambled egg.  Jumbo grilled squid is bomb. Perfectly grilled love the texture and the sauce comes with it. Egg rolls was decent just typical deep fried veg rolls. They also have some really good cocktails and great deals on beer too. Would come back to try out the rest of the menu hopefully a better positive outcome.",

    "text": "admittedly, i am a hell of a tough critic when it comes to thai food.  the same can be said about a few different cuisines, but with thai food specifically, i critique not just on taste, but on their ability to listen to my needs.  i am allergic to coconut, AND i can only handle a moderate amount of spicy stuff (unless i'm just in a spicy food kind of mood).  when visiting a thai restaurant, if the server does not appear to be listening to my two requirements, i am instantly leery and play it safe with pad thai or something common like that.  with all that said, OMFG, this place was SO goooooood!  i had been working reeeeally hard on sunday night and after a hellacious day and night of work, i happened upon this place with a friend and a coworker.  i say happened upon it because i am not from Las Vegas, and was only in town for work from LA.  my coworker is a total food.  my friend is a persnickety eater.  we were all overjoyed and satisfied with our food.  my coworker (the fellow foodie) had a spicy shrimp thing, which i believe was a sort of curry, but my hunger prevented me from paying closer attention to his order.  my friend (the picky eater) had a chicken in yellow curry.  i had the dish that was accurately named Seafood Delight.  delighted indeed i was!  first of all, i asked the waiter to have it made only slightly spicy.  they couldn't have possibly gotten the spice level more perfect!  it was amazing.  the aforementioned delights included:  shrimp, fishballs, scallops, mussels, and a myriad of appropriately matched veggies.  it was fantastic.    for a second i wondered if my hunger and tiredness contributed to how positively i received this meal, but no, this place stood as an excellent thai spot regardless of my pitiful state.  it bums me out that such an awesome thai place isn't actually found in LA.  i mean, some of the spots in thai town in hollywood are great, but this place is head and shoulders above it.  i'm not sure when i'll be back in Vegas, but whenever that is, i certainly hope to return here.  my foodie coworker concurred with this sentiment.  emphatically, five stars!",

I have been here a few times now, so it is a new place for me, but I am quickly becoming loyal.   Everything is so fresh and they dont overcook the veggies, which is great!   I have ordered: Tom Ka (tofu & veggie, vegan style) twice, very good & great that they make it vegan for me.

I guess none of us felt like getting ripped off anymore from expensive hotel eateries.  We went to Krung Siam simply by luck.  We were planning on going to the Pho place in the same plaza but somehow Thai food seemed more inviting at that moment.  The decor at Krung Siam was surprisingly nice.  It had a loungy restaurant feel unlike any other Thai place I've ever been too.  There were candles on the tables and the servers were all very friendly.  Best of all, they ad $4 buy one get one free bottles of imported beer.  Wow, that is cheap coming from the Strip where one bottle would run $7-9 bucks!  We ordered the Pad Thai, Chicken Green Curry and Glass Noodle Salad.  We orderd everything medium spicy but the food came out SUPER spicy.  So a word of caution, if you can't handle spicy food, ask them for low low spice.  They had a spice scale from 1-10, we got 5 but next time I'll know to get 2 or 3.  I was pleasantly delighted to see the large portions and taste the great flavors.  This was one of the better Thai places I've ever been too....mind you I was pretty drunk so my review might be a tad skewed.  Nevertheless, this place is definitely going to be one of our usual places off the Strip.",

And, on top of that, you get a thai ice tea or ice coffee for just a buck (at least $3 every else we saw). I had the drunken noodles at a heat level of five (they ask you what heat level you want your food from 1-10) and it was perfect. Lots of veggies and a generous portion of chicken. If I have one complaint about this place it is that their bathroom is quite messy especially since we were there relatively early in  the day. Suggestion on how to get there if you're staying on the strip: Take the free shuttle from Harrahs or Ballys to Rio then walk about a quarter of a mile up valley view rd. to Krung. Believe me, it's worth the walk.",

    "text": "This place should be ashamed of calling itself a Thai restaurant. The food was unfathomably difficult to take in. We ordered seafood tom yum soup, crab fried rice, chicken larb, green curry, and shrimp salad. We requested that the tom yum soup, chicken larb, and shrimp salad all be \"mild.\" I'm pretty sure that translates roughly to \"slightly spicy.\" None of our dishes were spicy in the least bit. We couldn't even find chili flakes or remnants. Our tom yum soup was sweet rather than spicy, the crab fried rice tasted plain and flavorless, and the chicken larb was shockingly sour. We had to ask them to take it back to make it less sour and give it some type of spicy flavoring. Chicken larb (version 2.0) tasted exactly the same. Are they taste-blind or something?! As for the last 2 dishes, the green curry was nothing special and the shrimp salad...well, let's just say we played rock paper scissors, and the loser had to finish the shrimp salad (we didn't want to waste it).  I feel slightly bad for giving their food such a terrible review because the service was great. They were very receptive to our complaints about the chicken larb. Unfortunately, the chef just couldn't deliver. Oh yeah, and they forgot about the chicken larb until we mentioned it. The other dishes had come out and we were almost full until we realized we hadn't received our chicken larb yet. We reminded the waiter, who said it would take just 2 more minutes...15 minutes later, he comes out with it. Proof that they forgot and started cooking it shortly after we reminded them.  A couple of other notes: There's a small stage inside the restaurant, and apparently they have live music every night starting at 8 or 9 pm until 2 am. The inside decor was nice and clean...restroom was a horror show though.",

All drinks were refilled in time: service was good.  Unless you're in a mood to have huge buffets at the Casinos, this would be a good place to have lunch.",

I also had the Crab Fired rice, and  a Thai Tea, that'll keep me awake for  a few hours.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  they live up to their great yelp reviews. I look forward to many more visits.

I've had my fair share of dining alongside Spring Mountain Road, and everything thus far has failed miserably except this place. The prices, however, does not match its quality.

He brought me back a new soup in THE SAME POT and it was the exact same soup with just coconut milk added into it. So I asked for a manager. no manager was working so I spoke with a senior employee who also didn't speak English. She explained to me that the soup was sent back and it was mixed with a soup mix since we already ate some of it (we literally had one bite and sent it back) after it getting sent back twice we finally got a new one. This one actually came with all the ingredients and it tasted like something other than fire! Still a bitch and a half to get my order right though.",

Let's face it... the only justification for Thai food having such prices is that it's pretty close to the strip; otherwise, it's better to go to other Thai restaurants throughout Vegas that are more reasonable.   Despite the prices, the food is certainly 4 stars! We ordered several dishes and shared \"family-style\" and were able to try a little bit of everything. Bowl of seafood soup, fried rice, chicken, the popular basil dish, green curry, and pad thai...  I love that you can specify the level of spice for your meal ... levels one through ten.   I finally went back a 2nd... and 3rd time and had a chance to order my dish 10/10 level the 2nd time and 15/10 level ;) the 3rd time. They did a fantastic job with the level of spice, and when I didn't like my first order *(for the first time in my life I found a dish I do not care for... it's the Thai beef noodle soup... the flavor was not enjoyable for me)*... the waiter was kind enough to replace my order with the Drunken Noodles, one of my all time favorite Thai dishes, which was EXCELLENT.   I will definitely be going back... just not too frequently because it'll probably burn a hole in my wallet ;).",

The second time I came to try their fabulously priced lunch deals at $4.99.  Both times I really enjoyed the food.    On visit one, we ordered pork larb, yellow chicken curry and red beef curry.  The larb was outstanding, and the curries were tasty and spiced just to the level we had asked for.  Service was a little spotty, meaning it was hard to get a server's attention, but not so bad as to be off-putting.  There was live entertainment with a woman singing love songs, and the restaurant had a cute ambiance with dark red walls and fairy lights on the ceiling.  Although it wasn't packed, the restaurant was almost full and it was obvious they do good business.  On visit two, we came around 1pm for lunch.  They have $1 thai iced teas and coffees as part of the deal, which is so cool!   The lunch menu is pretty extensive with about 10 different dishes, and your choice of meats or tofu.  They all come with a small soup and rice too.  I had the pork panang and it was delicious and a generous portion!  I think this is one of the best lunch deals that I've found yet in Las Vegas!",

The yellow curry was sweet and creamy. I'm always a little overwhelmed by yellow curry so I didn't like it, but if you enjoy yellow curry, you'll probably like this.  The red curry was powerful and had lots of bamboo to munch on. I found it very agreeable to my palate.  The basil chicken was pretty bad. I got what appeared to be shredded chicken drenched in some kind of overpowering sweet sauce. I have no idea whether it was chicken, pork, or beef, so that says a lot about the dish. Anyway, it was pretty bad and I find it hard to believe it's the \"most popular entree\" as listed on the menu.  3 stars only because of the live entertainment. Otherwise, the food is really meh and you're paying like $12 per dish.  Interior is dark and loud because of the music. Comfy, I suppose. Service was outstanding.",

Otherwise, they have late night karaoke on the stage during the week = *avoid late nights if you don't like drunk people screaming into the mic while you eat*  The food here is average and they have a scale of 1-10 for spiciness. Ask the waiter for reference because the spiciness ratio is different for each dish. A level 5 salad is as spicy as a level 10 curry. It also depends on how much coconut milk is in the curry. So if you don't want to take the risk, better to ask when you're ordering.",

They ask if I wanted to send the food back but I'm not one to send food back w/o worrying about the cook doing something to my food so I ate it and it wasn't bad, but  not what I wanted..

The Chicken Pad Thai had to be the best ever!  We shared a few dishes and everyone agreed that this was one  of the best Pad Thai we've had.  The Tom Yum  soup was intensely flavored, loaded with chicken, veggies and dumplings.  No complaints here.  The Pork Larb was also outstanding but since I was the only one that had ever had this dish before I preferred that it had more cilantro and mint.  The others thought it was great.  I loved the shrimp curry although my friends who don't like curry  didn't agree.  A matter of preference.     Three of us are going back in a couple of days and I will write another review then.",

I only liked these two dishes - Basil pork with white rice and the drunken noodles (mild). The rad na and pad thai were a bit bland for me.   For the price, the portion sizes were a bit too small for me. I like a hearty meal, so this place was better for snacking than dining. It might have been better if they gave us the lunch special, but they don't offer that during holiday seasons.",

The lunch menu itself has about 10 items on it and the dishes start at $5.99 which includes steamed rice and soup. It's a little more expensive if you upgrade the protein to shrimp or mixed seafood.   The soup that accompanishes the meal is a tangy tomato soup. I can't complain much since it was included, but it wasn't my favorite. It just had the consistency and color of sweet and sour sauce and it was just a little odd.   Overall this is a good place to get your Thai fix without busting your wallet. However since I live in Henderson, I might not make the long drive to visit this place again.",

The decor is actually cute and the restaurant is very spacious on the inside -- much different than most of the very compact restaurants on Spring Mountain. Our server was a bit rigid at first, but with time became a lot more relaxed and very friendly and attentive. The lunch deal was great.. $5.99 for soup of the day which was delicious Tom Kha on that particular day and one of many entree options. I of course opted for Drunken Noodles with chicken. They were great! The chicken was cooked perfectly and not too dry which is my main contention with most Thai places when it comes to their chicken dishes. I opted for heat level 6 on a scale 1-10. It had the perfect amount of heat..and I like spicy. So be cautious..if you don't do spicy regularly go for a 4-5 tops. Otherwise, 6-7 are ideal. This was a perfect lunch and you really can't beat the price for the quality and quantity of food.",

    "text": "Had an awful experience here last night. I normally wouldn't write a bad a review to hurt a business being that I've worked in restaurants for many years but I was very disappointed with this place. I came last night around midnight with a small group of friends. It took about 10 minutes for someone to see us waiting at the host stand to finally seat us. It was busy but not packed. Once we were seated we all figured out what we wanted to eat and waited atleast 15-20 minutes for someone to see us sitting with no waters and no service so a female came frantically over once she noticed us, took our order and food came out at a decent time. The food was good! That's the only good thing that came out of going here. I asked for napkins and chilli sauce when the food came, but never received it. We had all finished our meals and waited about 20 minutes for someone to come by so we could get our bill. The bill came and I gave him my card right away and didn't come back with my card and the bill to sign so after another 15 minutes or so I walked up to him at the register to see what was taking so long and he was all shuffled and distracted and said that he accidentally used my card for another table and charged me for their food and told me he needs to fix it and shooed me away. So I sat back down and waited another 15 min for him to come back with my card and a ton of receipts and he said sorry and ran away. I was charged for my meal and another's it shows that he voided the other meal but I know from experience that it takes several days to get that money back. I know waiting tables is stressful and hectic at times but he could have explained what happened and been  more helpful or apologetic and not rude about it.",

After one sip, I chugged half a pitcher of water.  After 2 sips, I begged for death.  And yet I went for a third sip.  I lost feeling in my fingers.  But it was so tasty!  Upon touching my tongue for the 4th sip, I started having visions of pokemon dancing around a blue pelican.  I blacked out.  Two days later, I awoke in Yan Nawa with nothing but my ex-wife's passport and half a twizzler in my pocket.  I wandered north for several hours.  I fear Bangkok has me now.",

Seems mostly Thai clientele dine and meet here. The atmosphere is lounge like. Karaoke songs sung were mostly Foreign, but pretty. The food and beverages were 15% off!!!! The spicy catfish, chicken satay, and spicy chicken krawpow were perfection. And what I liked even more was that I wasn't questioned when I asked for spice level 10. I hate being stereotyped. I can handle spicy! I finally got up enough courage to get up on stage to sing a few songs. There is a limited selection of karaoke songs in English. I had fun!...an added plus to the perfect Thai food. My two servers were so genuine and pleasant.",

Literally after I called, it took them an amazing 20 minutes to deliver the food, while estimating 45 minutes! The food quality was pretty good as well, and not overly expensive for the amount of food. The only thing was when I ordered how spicy I wanted the fried rice to be, I ordered a 10 on a 1-10 scale, and wasn't too spicy, but that might just be me. Overall, great find.

The jun prad poo was apparently a stir-fried noodle dish, with sweet chili and topped with lump crab meat, and will be the stuff of dreams for me for a while.  It was very, very good.  I've never had anything like it, and I want to go again soon.  The satay was nice, as well, very tender meat, and the curry was the perfect blend of creamy and spicy.  While everything was good, nothing beats the jun prad poo!    We had Thai Tea and Vietnamese coffee, as well, and while both were fine, they weren't that special.  Our water was refilled constantly, and the there was a very talented lady on the mic with a sultry voice that helped set the atmosphere, as well.  Low-lighting was nice, but not at all conducive to photos, so no photos for the review.  Everything was well-presented, though!  I liked it, give it a shot, especially the jun prad poo!",

Sure it's a short drive away from the strip, but with a price like that, how can you deny the perfect hangover food of noodles, rice, and spice? Not to mention, the decor of this restaurant is pretty modern, spacious, and they had a really good CD on that was playing good covers of Michael Jackson songs!   The lunch special I ordered was Drunken Noodles with chicken and came with the soup of the day which was kind of like a thick sweet and sour soup. I had a few slurps of it and wasn't a fan :[ As for the Drunken Noodles, Krung Siam has you choose on a scale from 1 to 10 how spicy you want your noodles. Why did I say 9? I HAVE NO IDEA! I'm a fan of spicy foods, but maybe I should have gotten a 7! Once my noodles came out, you could smell the load of chili peppers that were mixed into the dish. Before I even had a bite, I knew how spicy my meal was gonna be...and how I would regret it soon after we had left the restaurant and came back to the hotel :[ Poor tummy. Poor toilet :[ Nonetheless, it was still perfectly edible, but I wish I had gone for something more on a medium spice level to actually enjoy it. If you can take on the spice, try getting it at a 10! And with unbeatable lunch special prices at $5, sure, I'd come back!",

Friendly staff pointed me to the restroom which were under renovation and believe me when I tell you - they are in dire need of renovation.

A friend ordered some appetizers and we all dug in. The food was amazing! I was blown away! And I dont remember the last time I had dessert at a restaurant but I ordered the \"Mango & Sticky Rice\" and it was superb. Delicious food and great service.

Chicken pad Thai, cream cheese rangoons, chicken panang and Thai ice tea.   Usually I experiment and try new things from regularly visited restaurants but not this one. I don't think I come here often enough to want to try new things.   The decor is nothing special and it's a little stuck in the 90's with a small stage for some live random performances. One night an older Asian man was on stage singing everything from Frank Sinatra to Bruno Mars. It was awesome!   The pad Thai is on the sweet side so prepare to ask for some lime and peanuts but it's really delicious without those items as well. The tofu is a winner and stands out on its own. Sometimes I pick it out a few pieces and leave them on my plate so it's the very last thing in my mouth :)",

    "text": "Ordered Panang Curry / Basil Fried Rice. Spice level 7. Not as spicy as I thought, but well, my girlfriend thought that it was spicy so I guess I will make it spicier next time. Anyways, I got here with my girlfriend at around 9PM ish. Even the time was late, there were guest that were consistently coming in. We ordered Panang Curry And Basil Fried Rice as I Have written up there. Food was really great, great portion with reasonable price. Only part I thought it would be better was, The Basil scent was really strong for both Panang Curry and fried rice. I understand that it is Basil fried rice, but it was stronger than what I expected. I would believe that some people would love that flavor, so I won't deduct on that. Service was great, server was attentive and nice. I will for sure come back to this place to try different things",

Not memorable at all. The Thai tea wasn't wow either. Maybe because I like my Thai tea sweet. I will say, they have really good mango sticky rice and roti. Today's mango, however was not sweet at all. 2 entrees, Thai tea, and mango sticky rice with Roti was 56 bucks not including tip. Was it worth it? Not really.",

    "text": "This place was such a disappointment for my boyfriend and I.. :(  We started off with the chicken satay.  That was the only decent thing we had on the menu.  I had the garlic and pepper entree with beef over rice.  It wasn't good at all.  The beef was hard and chewy, not edible.  My boyfriend had pad thai and he didn't like it either.    We left our plates almost completely full... and wasted $30.  I came here once before and ordered some kind of chicken meal, I don't remember what exactly.  But I didn't eat more than two bites.  The chicken wasn't good at all.  I only came back because my boyfriend had a decent meal and wanted to return.  We learned our lesson this time.  Both times I have been here there was a live performance, which is kind of cool.  The service was friendly, which is the only reason I gave this place two stars (and the decent appetizer).  However, neither one of us will be returning.",

    "text": "Just finished a take out order from KST as I'm still on my Dan P mission of Thai restaurant reviews.  I had reviewed the menu online and was pleasantly surprised to see a number of Salmon dishes available as lunch specials.  Salmon Basil, Salmon with Garlic, Three Taste Salmon.   My head was spinning with daydreams of trying each and every one and incorporating KST into my list of go-to restaurants for relatively healthy lunch options.   Plus they have brown rice! It was love at first menu review.  Call in the order. \"We don't have salmon anymore\"   Okay Chicken Basil it is, spiced 7/10.   Ho hum.  But still, brown rice! :D  When I walked in, I was surprised to see a large, extremely busy restaurant.  I don't know what I was expecting or why I was expecting it, but it wasn't that.  I actually waited for a couple in front of me to be seated and informed the waiter I had a take out order.  He was extremely efficient and friendly and got me in and out of there in about 2 minutes flat.  Back to the office the disappointments started to pile up.   First, inside the bag was simply my entree in a takeout container.  No napkins, no plasticware, no sauces, literally just the takeout container.  How is at least a napkin and fork set not a standard take out provided item?   Actually opening the entree led to more disappointment.   Their website states (along with the non-existent salmon dishes): \"Served with steamed or fried rice, egg roll, wonton, salad, and soup of the day.  Soup not included in togo order\"   Well, there wasn't ANYTHING other than my entree and rice.  No egg roll, no wonton, no salad.  Now as I said before, it was pretty busy so I can forgive some oversight, but to miss out on providing 3 of the 5 components of a take out lunch special, and to not provide napkins or plasticware?     But still, brown rice!!!!!!    Well, not quite.  For the next disappointment, the rice provided inside the 2/3 full takeout container (I assume the 1/3 was supposed to have the salad and/or eggroll and wonton) was regular steamed white rice.    Here's the kicker, I actually enjoyed what I received quite a bit.  The chicken was nicely ground up, and the dish had a great flavor overall.  The rice wasn't as sticky as I usually like and almost ventured into Uncle Ben's like levels of separation.  The spice level was a little more intense than I usually look for in a 7, but I wouldnt mind so much if it wasn't for the other oversights.  All in all I have to go with a 2.  Had they gotten the order correct and provided me with what I ordered, it would have been a solid 3 for sure.  Brown rice :(",

After 10 minutes I pushed through the crowd and asked if we could sit at the bar and the most friendly lady said yes. She immediately poured us 2 thai iced teas and gave us menus. I chose the curried duck and my wife chose a papaya salad. The curried duck was fantastic...so many flavors competing it was just fantastic. The papaya salad was well liked by my wife. After lunch we went next door for a massage. $25 for 45 mins. It was a great day!",

We ordered the lunch special pad Thai and Red curry with the normal order of drunken noodles. The waitress never asked how spicy we wanted our food,  which is what I'm usually accustomed to at a Thai restaurant. We also ordered some Thai teas.   We got our 2 soups which wasn't too bad. Not sure what kind of soup it was. Now onto the entrees.   -Pad Thai (chicken) : Wasn't much flavor to it at all, just overly sweet. Chicken was ok.  -Red Curry (chicken): Not spicy at all. Wasn't that good. Didnt even if finish it.  -Drunken Noodles (beef): Not spicy at all. The description made it sound like it was spicy and sounded like pad kee mao. This wasn't very flavor either. Just oily noodles and some garnishes.   Now the service. We were in here close to an hour and the server came by once to check up on us and refill our drinks. We then waited a while so we can ask for our check and she never came at all and nowhere in sight. I had to get up and find her. She was talking to a coworker and chit chatting it up.   The service and food were both equally lacking here.",

I go to the bar and wait 5 minutes to get attention.  Meanwhile i witnessed about 5 dishes getting cold in the window waiting to get picked up.  I looked around and there were more than enough employees but they all looked like chickens with their heads cut off.   I order beef red curry with no basil or mint leaf. 15 min later I get beef red curry with basil all over the sumbitch.  I returned it with no apology...not even a smile.  In fact, I didn't catch a smile since I had walked in.  Service with a smile?  Nuh uh. Shitty service, no smile.  Now for the food...eh.  Yeah.  Whatevs.    So...my first time here: Shitty service Messy dining room No smiles (like they didn't want customers) And the food was just ok  Bad day at the office?

    "text": "If I could give them 2.5 stars, I would.  Headed there for lunch today and I'm not sure I'll be going back. My boyfriend and I used to come here a lot, especially for the great lunch specials, but the last few times, the service has been terrible.   The last time we went in, we had a party of three and I'm pretty sure they forgot about our food because the owner and his family of 12 came in and demanded all of the server's attention (this was at least a year ago).  Today we decided to try it again and while the waiter was quick to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything, my lunch came out 10-15 minutes before his did. If I'd have waited for his food to come out, mine would have been cold.   The plus side is that the food is always good. They go a little heavy on the sweet sauce on the crab rangoons, but other than that, it's great Thai food for a decent price. You just have to be willing to put up with the crappy, inconsistent service.",

    "text": "Although there a lot of Thai places around Las Vegas, I am still looking for my one place that I can always count on. Krung Siam is ok, but not sure it is my favorite of all places. The service was ok - it was not a busy night and they somehow managed to not get our order correct, even though the server had repeated what we wanted.   We ordered the yellow curry with tofu, beef drunken noodles, and the spicy chicken wings. The flavor for all of the dishes were good, although for medium spicy, it felt like it was more mild. Each Thai place is very different as I have been to other places that their mild was more like hot. I wish the restaurants were more consistent. For the price, the portion sizes were decent, but not huge. They also charge for extra rice.   The one good thing is they do have happy hour drinks/beers - so go before 8p and get your pints/pitchers for a great price!",

    "text": "I have been a regular at late night Krung Siam for years. It's been a favorite go-to for descent \" Thai \" in the wee hours if the night.   The problem is that it's consistently gone down in service and quality. On my most recent visit, we had a waiter we'd never seen before. He didn't appear to speak English. Our order coming out incorrectly was an indicator that he wasn't understanding Us.  We calmly asked again, and again, and over the course of an hour or so.. we got allot of attitude about sending back items we didn't not order. On top of it, we asked for water 4x, and the server was clearly being vindictive and ignoring us.   A different female server started coming over to fix things.. and finally we got the 3 of the 4 things we wanted. No water tho..but at least our beer finally arrived. Originally we ordered Asahi, and when they didn't show up after 10 minutes.. I asked the server. He motioned that they didn't have Asahi.. so we got Newcastle.   Sufficed to say, it's not a good feeling when you regularly spend quality money on garbage service and food. When we approached the guy that we were told was manager.. he told us that he \" didn't care if we didn't come back \" ... Awesome. Telling locals to not come back. People that are literally there once a week or so. Donezo  Happy Eating :)",

    "text": "A Great Place for Lunch!!  The food in this place is not in a class with Archi's, and certainly, does not hold a candle up to Lotus of Siam. But for your classic American Thai favorites as a lunch special, this is a really good value.   The Panang Curry with Chicken is a good lunch portion, but the curry is thin. My wife enjoyed the noodle dishes, and feels the same way about the quality. Not impressive, but acceptable for a lunch, served in a relaxing atmosphere.   Lunches are fair portions, and served with soup before the main course.   Service is prompt and friendly. You actually get the same server throughout, and they check back on a regular basis. Very refreshing in a Thai place.   Best deal......Thai Iced Teas and Coffees are just $1 during lunch.   Location is good with easy parking.   For the cost of a trip to Quizino's or a mediocre burger joint, you can enjoy a somewhat healthy lunch at a great price.",

    "text": "Today was the 30th anniversary of when I moved to Las Vegas so me and my friend Tony came here around 8:30 pm.Let me preface this review by saying that I'm not a huge aficionado of Thai food.I like Chinese food and sushi more.But anyway,we came here and it was a mixed bag,which is why I'm giving it 3 stars:not bad enough to get 1 star nor great enough to get 5 stars.  Good points include:  I enjoyed the live singer and his older songs from the 60s,70s and 80s were perfect for me.  The place had a decent,modern look.  I ordered a Thai Iced tea which I enjoyed.  The service was good.  The food quality seemed adequate.But I'm not real knowledgeable  about Thai food,so I can't say for sure.  Bad points include:  The place is very dimly lit.It was tough to read the menu,plus there was a transparent plastic sheet on the menu which tended to distort the menu.  The prices are slightly higher than I am comfortable paying.  The portions could have been a bit larger.  The last Thai restaurant I went to was Thai place in Target Shopping Center on Flamingo and Maryland.While it is not a fancy place by any stretch of the imagination  (most people would consider it a \"hole in the wall\") ,the quality and quantity of the food seemed much better.(I'm talking about a simple Pad Thai dish in both cases.) The price was lower there,too.  One of the biggest turn offs that both my friend and I experienced was when the food server brought the check while I was still eating and asked if we could pay it right away.That seemed to us like a combination of being rushed and being distrusted.While we all know that feelings are very subjective and that might not have been the servers intent,that's how we took it.It definitely rubbed us the wrong way.  I might come back here again,but I won't go out of my way.If you feel like eating here,by all means try it.You'll probably like it.In this review,I was just attempting to share with you what my experience was like.I've had better and I've had worse. Good luck to you if you eat here and I'm not saying that in a sarcastic way.",

I'm also Thai so I'm big on Thai cuisines therefore I can say that this restaurant is a must-go-to for any Thai cravings (asides their papaya salad because it wasn't as spicy nor as juicy as it authentically could have been). The prices are reasonable, their service is consistent and welcoming, the atmosphere is mellow and professional, and their food is beyond delicious! I highly suggest this restaurant for those seeking authentic Thai entrees with a hint of fancy but good price ranges. I ordered their Tom Yum, Panang, Pad See Ew, Larb and Crying Tiger! It was so scrumptious!",

At first look, this place looked more like a pub than anything else so i was feeling quite shady about the food. I ordered a Thai Red Curry to-go and the waitress/bartender took my order to the kitchen. We waited for about 15minutes for our food to be ready, quite fast considering its 1am in the morning and in between, th waitress even served us iced water! The place was playing thai music videos off youtube on a tv screen and it just kind of creates a very relaxing atmosphere.  Well back to the food, back at the hotel, when i opened my container of Thai Red Curry, i was immediately overwhelmed by the smell of red curry and i knew i hadn't made a wrong choice coming. The curry was thick and rich, and the serving was generous, there were lots of meat and potatoes inside the curry, enough to fill my famished stomach. The jasmine rice they used for the steamed rice was of a good quality the portion was also large. My stomach was very happy after that:)",

If you can snag one of the big booths, it makes for a private and intimate meal.   The service is attentive and good, and your drinks will never be empty. They have occasional live music that can be very loud, making it difficult to have conversations without yelling. The entertainment has always been of mediocre quality.    The food is great quality and the spicy levels seem to be what you expect. I personally get the drunken noodles, pad kee mao, and they are some of the best I have had in the city. I also enjoy the basil fried rice.   Overall, good ambience and quality food.",

Pretty big restaurant with open space makes it a nice venue for a full table and even for live music some nights.  They have a pretty good wine menu and some good menu options, but everything is priced a few dollars higher than the quality.  Dishes are large as the spicy eggplant and beef salad filled up 2 people.  Throw in the appetizer platter and you have lunch for tomorrow.  I ordered a 10 spicy level and it was hot but more of a late burn.  There are definitely hotter options in town.  Fine food but there are better options (some literally right down Spring Mountain) for better Thai.  But still should be on the short list for Vegas Thai food in China Town.",

We had the tom yum soup which really good.  We had the crabmeat fried rice which was the \"BOMB\" it has really good flavor and they arent cheap about the crab either. There was some big chunks of crabmeat which really surprised me.  Then had the pad thai noodle which was the best i have had at any thai place.  The servers were very friendly and they live music .  We enjoyed this place so much that we came back the second night again for dinner! If you're ever in Vegas definitely visit this place in Chinatown",

This time was no exception. They are able to hit all the tasty sweet, sour, spicy notes Thai food is typically using a mix of spices, seasoning, and mints. Their portions of protein and carbohydrates are well balanced as well. I never feel like I'm left at the end with too much meat and no noodle or vice versa.   I did order my food too spicy this time and was unable to finish my food, but I feel that was my fault more than their. I wish there was a more consistent way for people to order their food spiciness across all restaurant or at least Thai restaurant. I ordered a 7 and could not finish my food because each bite felt like eating fire, so watch the spiciness!",

Pad Thai spicy lvl 7 (definitely going with 5 next time)  with chicken is my go to. I've had this classic Thai dish prepared at many restaurants before  and none of them made my palette go \"WOW\" like this one.  Interestingly it comes with tofu at no extra charge, I did ask the waiter if I could do without but the language barrier was just that.   Obviously the first step in eating Pad Thai is getting a spoon full of your peanuts to scatter over the noodles. The first word that came to my mouth was JUICY although it wasn't soupy in anyway. So much flavor in my mouth I think to myself  \" Is this what real Pad Thai taste like\" mind you the food just came out piping hot but I couldn't resist . Take in consideration I got spicy lvl 7 which I normally get at other places but it's not as spicy. That being said the Pad Thai here compares to no other, apperantly the spicy system does too.",

    "text": "We got a chance to go through a good bit of the menu here with a large group of friends while eating our way through Las Vegas. There was a large bottle of whiskey involved, and lots of interesting, very Thai dishes.   Krung is one of the best places in the Vegas area to get excellent Thai food, and not have to rush to get there before they close. After having approximately half of the menu, I can say (from what I can remember) I'm pretty sure you'll love just about anything here, especially if you go beyond the basic tom yum / pad thai / curry something / basil chicken routine.   I really loved the Pad See Ew here. It had the characteristic smoky wok fragrance, rich, fat rice noodles and a balance of sweet and savory that makes all the calories worth it. A common problem with this dish is that it is too oily and/or it was not cooked over super high heat using proper wok technique. This one is perfect though, in every way. It's nice to add a bit of pepper vinegar and roasted pepper flakes to taste - and many Thai do this. Condiments are available for this purpose.  Lao style papaya salad! Juicy, sweet, sour, palette cleansing, stomach settling vibrance of green papaya and spicy - the kind of spicy you need to work up to. I maintain a pretty high tolerance to this heat level, as I eat this dish pretty often. I ended up destroying most of the first serving. I seemed to have forgotten we were sharing and so we ended up getting another one lol. I really get a taste for this when I've had some whiskey, which leads me to another thing I like with whiskey:   Naem. I do remember some sort of naem platter, and I do love naem - especially with whiskey. Problem is, by then I was past the point of woodford and into the Johnny Walker level. So, I know little more beyond this point. We don't often eat dessert, and I'm not sure if we did or not. After that we were in a lyft back to the strip and all that follows is a blur.   A thought: to expand beyond the farang basics in Thai food, one must realize first that Thailand is a whole universe of food that will never be fully represented by curries and heaps of basil stir fried meats+veg. So. Try something with noodles, try something with fish, and ask your waiter for recommendations. Krung is a great place to do this.   Krung was a high point in a trip where I learned Bouchon is not as good as it used to be, and the Russian burger bar I've been wanting to try is gone. I'm glad I got a chance to come out here, and I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas. : )",

In fact, my friends and I hit this place up two times during our trip this weekend.   Food:  1. Day One: Tom Yum Noodle Soup I ordered this dish with flat rice noodles and it definitely hit the spot after a crazy night of drinking. The soup tasted super authentic and was not too tart.  As for the meat and fishballs, there was plenty of that so no need to worry about the portions here!   2. Day Two: Spicy Basil Fried Rice  I had a taste of my friend's order the day before and I was hooked instantly. The rice had a strong garlicky taste so this is a great dish for a garlic lover. The beef that came with this dish actually surprisingly tender and not chewy at all.  Final Verdict:  Thumbs up.",

It is understandable at a certain point, but the restaurant is not really busy and they also added the tip, which is understandable since we are also a waiter and you know that we live on tips. To which I told the waitress to change her attitude and to which she replied that if she did not like the next time she could meet another waiter. If I, as a waiter, say this to a client in the restaurant where I work, they dismiss me! Very good food and atmosphere everything !! Hopefully next time I will not touch the same waitress or change her attitude.",

I dare say...we visited twice on our trip off strip to eat here.  Must try the raw shrimp with chilli and crying tiger.  You haven't lived until you have experienced this beautiful meld of flavors and spices.  I can't quite explain it.  Really.  The papaya salad is perfectly balanced too...my goodness.  I have never been so happily sedated with food.  The ambience is soft and quiet and dimly lit.  They have a Thai singer crooning soft rock some evenings and the restaurant is beautifully decorated though simple.  The service is fair but oh boy the food...any Thai food connoisseur's taste buds will dance here.  This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas now.  I shall travel to eat here when in Vegas.  I've never seen the look in my husband's eyes since the very first time we met.  Nirvana.  Lol.  Just go try it for yourself.",

Second time, a server told me the complete opposite, that their curry is already pre-made, and cannot be made vegan. The inconsistency is very off-putting.  The best characteristic about this place (and the reason I've gone here twice) is that it's open very late, when no other Thai restaurant is open.",

We went at an odd time around 5:30 so a bit early for dinner, but there was no music playing, though I could see the set up. It was quiet and we got seated at a big booth right away. We were able to enjoy our time eating while chatting. The waiters were attentive and refilled my water without being asked. That's always a plus for me because I drink a lot of water. I think the price is a little more than usual thai food restaurant, but I wouldn't say it is pricey. I think entrees start at about 11 dollars.",

    "text": "This place just doesn't it for me.  As a restaurant, it just is a mess to me.  One of my best friend's dad is actually a chef here, so definitely no favoritism.. Sorry Alex!  My main reason for the mediocre rating is #1 The prices and #2 I just don't like the place.  I think having a stage is so cheesy for a Thai restaurant. Thai's know how to get down on karaoke and I'm sure everyone's family has a machine at home, but unfortunately the talent they choose at this restaurant for the entertainment is definitely just like at home.  The Thai videos playing are also just cheesy.  And please turn some lights on at night, most the diners are drunk and can't see.  I've been here a couple times. The first time was when my friend was visiting from out of state (he's the chef's son). We got a bit of a discount, and even a free entree, but the price was up there for Thai food.   It is a nice establishment as far as the decor, and that it isn't a little hole in the wall, but add the mediocre service to the equation and it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe that's the voice of my Thai mom who left it instilled in my head that her food will always be better than any restaurant and cheaper. Krung Siam doesn't prove my mom wrong.  I've had their grilled beef salad, their version of combination pho, and pad se ew, and the yellow chicken curry.  Pho was definitely mediocre, beef salad was really good quality, the side of sticky rice was microwaved too much, pad se ew was good, and the yellow chicken curry had a lot of filler.  Their Thai tea sucks too.  Overall i'm just not convinced there's anything special about this place in any category. The food is decent, the prices are understandable, the service is medicore.  I'd only go back for a late night craving as most Thai places are closed late at night.",

    "text": "This is a go to lunch spot for us! For $6.99 you get a cup of soup and a decent lunch sized entree. The dining room always has plenty if tables filled, good sign. The music is this weird mix of current hits but jazzed up like, if that's the best way to describe it. The soup is usually some veggie soup Thai style. I typically like it, only once was it a little funky even for my taste. The Boyfriend doesn't usually eat it because he thinks mushrooms are poison and will kill him if he eats them so I get two cups which fill me and then I tend to have leftovers of my entree for my lunch the next day. The entrees are good. I usually get the Pad Thai but sometimes switch it up. Today I got Yellow Curry and it was delish as was the particular soup they had today. Their iced tea is also good it's very floraly if you like that kinda stuff!   I gave it 4 stars because sometimes the service is ify, mostly because they don't always keep drinks filled and that is a huge peeve of mine while dining out. I could honestly care less if they never asked me how things were because I'm not that picky but I just want my drink to be kept full.",

The ambiance is nice inside and there was live music towards the end of dinner (on Friday).    Review of the dishes: 1. Beef salad: refreshing starter with tender beef slices 2. Papaya salad: will light your mouth on fire...so be careful when selecting the spice level 3. Yellow curry: a little too sweet for my taste...too much coconut milk and not enough spices 4. Garlic shrimp: while good with a crispy shell that you can eat, it lacks the flavor and crunch factor of the version at Lotus of Siam 5. Basil Fried Rice and Pad Thai: hard to make these dishes exceptional...since they are typical Thai fare.... 6. Pork Larb (ground pork): extremely salty, lacking any other distinct flavor 7. Spicy Wings: tastes like sweet and sour to me.....  Overall, decent Thai place, but nothing exceptional....my preference would be for Lotus of Siam or Archi's before this place.",

    "text": "This is really a 3.5-star rating; the bump has to go in some direction, and I feel like Krung SIam has 4-star potential. (Also, my husband's review will be three stars, so together it works out. Yelp math!)  We hit Krung last night after doing an \"Open Now\" search on Yelp at 2 a.m.. After eliminating all of the usual casino coffeeshops (with their limited late-night menus) and deciding against a drive to Jean to try the all-night buffet (summer break = Teachers Eating Wild!),Krung it was.  \"Wait, didn't this building used to be Satay?\" My husband had been bugging me to go to Satay ever since trying their chicken sticks at the International Food Fair. (Translation: 2007.) Well, look honey, you finally got your wish.  I was rubbing my hands in anticipation because my love affair with Marnee Thai, also in \"Chinatown\" and also open in the very wee hours, was cut short on the second visit when we found the menu, ownership, and seemingly the chef had all changed. Noooo! We were supposed to be the Brangelina of late-night Thai. Shari + Marnee =... Sharnee! A portmanteau for the foodie ages! But now I had a second chance at finding late-night Thai love. (Shari + Krung =... Shrung? Hm.)  Right away I was struck by the pleasant, spacious decor. (Space is a big deal with me. It's an only-child thing.) We were seated in a long, cushy booth by the little stage where bouncy remixes were blasting. A customer soon came over to turn it up even louder. Eeek. The cushions in the booth were shaking like we were playing the Top Gun slot and just got the bonus game. Then a waiter hurried back to turn it down; we gave him an appreciative nod. Then he came back to turn it up again, asking us if it was okay. Awkward. At this point we were the only people sitting by the stage, and the few other patrons across the room didn't appear to be the partying type. We shrugged it off as Krung's \"thing\" and got used to it. If the restaurant had been busier, though, the overall noise may have been too much.  Several reviews of Krung complain about the promptness of the service. Our two servers were polite and swift with refills. Absolutely no problems there.  We ordered large. We're never too proud to get to-go boxes for tomorrow's lunch. Fried tofu, chicken satay sticks, fresh (not fried, although that's available) spring rolls, pad thai with tofu, and basil with chicken. Although I'm disappointed every time I go to a Thai restaurant and they don't have summer rolls like Panna Thai does, the menu was nicely varied and much on par with Archi's in that regard.  Fried Tofu: The best I've had in Las Vegas. Definitely crispy, pieces not so large that the center is gooey, and I really liked the usual sourish sauce with a heavy layer of peanuts on top.   Chicken Satay Sticks: And these were, according to my husband, the worst in Las Vegas. Ever. Bland. Kind of cold. \"Tasted like they'd been microwaved, and not very well.\" The satay sauce was not unlike unsalted peanut butter.  Fresh Spring Rolls: Huge! Imagine a double-fistful of salad wrapped in lettuce, and the salad is deliciously aromatic with a spicy crunch. Fun to try, but hard to eat, and we definitely didn't need four of these giant things. (Came with the same satay sauce in quasi-shot glasses with peanuts on top. We eventually started dipping them in the bowl of sauce that came with the fried tofu instead - much easier to manage.)  Basil: I'll let my husband review that one on his own, but he liked it.  Pad Thai with Tofu: I know, not very adventurous, but I just love pad thai. The tofu seemed to be fried first then cut up, making for some unfried sides, which is not how I prefer it, but it was still good, especially since the tofu pieces were small.   I asked for the heat to be \"7, maybe 6-7,\" and I feel they nailed that perfectly. That said, on a few occasions I crunched into a tiny pepper-pocket that must've still had seeds, as my tongue nearly blistered right off. I don't seem to get that problem elsewhere.  Overall, the flavours mixed well to suffuse the entire dish, and I can honestly say this is the only pad thai I've had in a long time where I didn't seek out all of the tofu bits to eat first.  As good as the service was, we did have a timing problem after all. Our two main dishes came out within a few minutes of our appetizers, so we had almost no time to linger and enjoy the \"courses.\" Instead it was like a tableside buffet. Luckily we'd realized at this point that we'd prefer a quick meal, but if it had been a more normal hour and we'd not been on the tired side, this would've been disappointing.  Overall, Krung is a place I will delight in visiting after-hours, but when the sun is up, it's still going to be Panna Thai, Archi's, and maybe Pin Kaow II for me.",

It was alright, not memorable at all. 2nd time - beef panag.  The beef was quite tasteless when taken out of the curry.  It's as if though they just quickly dump the beef into the bowl and added curry over it.  Not very good. 3td time - chicken panang.  Yay, this tasted decent.  The thin slices of chicken worked really well in this panang curry.  All three times, I got thai iced tea, which was only $1...what a steal.
